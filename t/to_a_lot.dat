During his presidency, he ordered the execution of Andrés and Procopio Bonifacio in 1897 after the trial.|$|E
25|$|The {{tests have}} narrowed the {{curriculum}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of schools, usually squeezing out classes such as {{art and music}} {{simply because they are}} excluded in the tests, then they are wiped out of the curriculum. Teachers are then forced to teach subjects that only influence the literacy level and comprehension ability of a student and leave out the ones that often require talent or skill.|$|E

25|$|Later, {{moves in}} the 1970 with the Child and Family Ministry of British Columbia, {{there was a large}} grab of {{indigenous}} children who were then placed in mostly non-indigenous home, located distances away from their ancestral homes. This later led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of problems for returning people back to their native community and a strong strike on cultural practices conducted by the native people.|$|E
25|$|The Iberian Peninsula {{was home}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of {{different}} peoples and cultures, so its normal to these cultures {{to influence the}} others but still retain a little of their aspects - this happened with the Portuguese music. From the Pauliteiros de Miranda in the Terra de Miranda to the Corridinho in the Algarve, the traditional music and songs transpire a poetic character that tells {{the history of a}} community to other people and generations to come.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, due {{to severe}} drought {{across much of}} the Murray Darling Basin Catchment area the Darling River ceased to flow and the Menindee Lakes dried out, Broken Hill {{essentially}} ran out of water, with a muddy sludge coming out of some taps around Christmas time in 2004.

Applying a cradle to the back of a panel painting almost always leads to more severe structural problems depending on the climate in which the painting is kept and the way the planks of the panel were saw.

25|$|The Austrians went <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{of trouble}} {{to conceal the}} {{strength}} of Davidovich's corps from their enemies. The ruse was so successful that Bonaparte ordered Vaubois to advance and defeat his opponent {{so that he could}} shift 3,000 troops to help fight Alvinczi. On 2 November, Vaubois attacked Davidovich near Cembra, inflicting 1,116 casualties before retiring. Though the French suffered only 650 killed and wounded, this included 280 soldiers of the 85th Line Infantry Demi Brigade. This loss seems to have seriously damaged the unit's morale. The next day, Vaubois pulled back to Calliano.|$|E
25|$|The club's {{board of}} {{directors}} has nine members, with each director serving a three-year term before their position is put up for re-election at an AGM. Only one-third of the board is contested at each AGM due to the rolling structure {{of the terms of}} the directors. This structure safeguards the entire board from being ousted at a single AGM and has made North Melbourne immune <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the in-house fighting witnessed at other AFL football clubs. The board governs the club as well as selecting a chairman to head the club through a majority vote of directors.|$|E

A member of the tribute band Queen Mania, Sasai cites Queen as a major musical influence. Preferring the musical genres heavy metal and alternative rock, his favorite bands are Extreme, Judas Priest, and Red Hot Chili Peppers. He {{has said that he}} also listens to hard rock and has begun to enjoy genres such as progressive rock as well.

25|$|The {{majority}} of the events are categorized as seemingly peaceful by many students, stating that they consist mainly of students standing around, chanting and singing. There is also still debate among UMass students {{as to whether or}} not the term “riot” applies <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the occurrences since they seldom involve violence or aggressive behavior from the vast {{majority of}} students present. Nevertheless, each event is met with police interference due to a fear of the unsafe environments that large unattended crowds could create. In the past there has been friction between members of the student body and the UMass Police Department around their methods of crowd control; students have been displeased with what they see as unnecessary force.|$|E
25|$|It {{will be a}} win-at-all costs approach. We're {{going to}} go out and give 110 per cent-over four days of every Shield game. If you give 110 per cent, you'll win a lot more games than you lose. I've been 12 months out of the game but if I see a ball I think I can hit, I will hit it... It's a big part of the {{captaincy}} so everyone knows where they stand. A happy team turns into a confident team and wins matches. But I have a hell of a lot to learn. It's my first shot at it and I will be listening <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people. People who are willing to give advice and have a bit of a yarn.|$|E

25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words, and hence consume more research instrument space, than lexical measures. Respondents are asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, Talk <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of different people at parties or Often feel uncomfortable around others. While some statement-based measures of extraversion/introversion have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For example, statements asking about talkativeness in parties are hard to answer meaningfully by those who do not attend parties, as Americans are assumed to do. Moreover, the sometimes colloquial North American language of statements makes them less suited to use outside America. For instance, statements like Keep in the background and Know how to captivate people are sometimes hard for non-native English-speakers to understand except in a literal sense.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the serial}} was filmed on {{location}} in Aldbourne, Wiltshire. The location shoot was awarded two weeks' filming, {{more than double the}} usual amount at the time, leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the finished story being set outside, rather than in studio. Membury airfield in Berkshire and Bridge Farm, Ramsbury, were also used briefly as locations. Filming began on 19 April 1971 and saw pleasant, sunny weather for the first week, leading to sudden overnight snow in the second week - causing filming to be delayed. Some episode one scenes were filmed at night - a rarity for the show, although some of these scenes were filmed during daylight with a dark filter put over the camera lens. Other dark indoor scenes were filmed in a disused aircraft hangar at Bridge Farm, Ramsbury. Filming for the serial caused great excitement in Aldbourne, {{with a lot of the}} village residents appearing as extras, as well as the Headington Quarry Morris dancers performing a routine in episode four.|$|E
25|$|I {{had watched}} Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – {{as a boy}} and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure. In fact, he was a mentor <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of us then – myself, David Gower, Ian Botham, Mike Gatting. Ken was an England {{selector}} and assistant manager on the West Indies tour of 1981. There were no official coach in those days but it was to Ken {{that most of us}} turned. Unlike many retired pros, he never used the words, 'In my day...' On the first night of the Test, he suffered a heart attack in our hotel. I was woken the next morning at around 8am by tour manager Alan Smith and captain Ian Botham. I knew something was wrong, because Both was never up before then. They told me the news. I had tears in my eyes when we went out on to the pitch for the minute's silence and again when I was batting in the second innings. We needed over 500 to win and it soon became apparent that we weren't going to get them. But I kept thinking of him and managed to make a hundred. Kenny was a counsellor, a friend and an inspiration.|$|E

25|$|Mariano's first {{experience}} with art was at fours years old with his cousin, teaching him how to draw simple shapes. He and his brother, Jonathan Ching who would also grow up to become an artist, would spend their time to draw instead of playing outside. He was greatly influenced by the anime Mazinger Z and Voltes V which was widely popular during his youth. They would significantly affect his future works. Reaching his high school years, his parents reminded him to think carefully about his life career. They {{said there is no}} money in art and should consider medicine or engineering as career and to make art as a hobby. But despite his parents' constant reminder, Mariano still pursued the road of becoming an artist. He enrolled <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of art workshops to hone his skills. One of the workshops that he attended became the turn point of his life. At the art workshop which is headed by Elemer Borogan and Gina Morales, the art style of the paintings has touched him and made him to decide to switch from his fourth year engineering major to painting major in University of the Philippines. During his years in University of the Philippines, he co-founded the art group Surrounded by Water. There, he found his future wife, Yasmin Sison which {{is also a member of}} Surrounded by Water. Mariano Ching, at that time, was still new at the art scene and he has not garnered any recognition yet.|$|E
25|$|Work on all {{buildings}} {{was postponed}} in May 1927. On May 6, {{an ad hoc}} committee composed of Olmsted; Medary; Charles Moore, chair of the Commission on Fine Arts; and Louis E. Simon, Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury, recommended relocating the Justice building from 15th Street NW <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> further east so that traffic congestion at 15th and Pennsylvania might be alleviated. This ad hoc committee met again three days later to not only consider the Justice building relocation but also to consider a plan to create a single building ringing Federal Triangle rather than six to eight individual structures. The Public Buildings Commission considered the same plan on May 16. The Commission on Fine Arts approved relocating the Justice building the following day. However, disagreements among the three planning bodies proved so fundamental that a new Board of Architectural Consultants was created on May 19, 1927, to advise the groups {{on the development of}} Federal Triangle. The Board consisted of the Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury (Louis E. Simon) and six private architects, including Louis Ayres, Edward H. Bennett, Arthur Brown, Jr., William Adams Delano, Milton Bennett Medary, and John Russell Pope. The Board of Architectural Consultants first met on May 23, at which time it considered a plan to create a single building ringing Federal Triangle rather than six to eight individual structures. As the Board of Architectural Consultants began its deliberations, the Commission on Fine Arts approved a plan to locate the Justice building {{on the north side of}} B Street NW between 7th and 9th Streets NW (where Center Market stood). About two weeks later, the Public Buildings Commission approved the single structure plan. This plan envisioned a central plaza (defined by 13th, 14th, B, and D Streets NW) surrounded by a traffic circle, with the buildings lining the exterior of the traffic circle. Few streets would be closed; rather, arches would connect each building to its neighbors (with only 12th Street NW remaining unbridged).|$|E
