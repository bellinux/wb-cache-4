5|$|Even though Thiệu {{used the}} defeat of the South Vietnamese forces as a {{justification}} for the arrest of those generals, his real intention behind the arrests was <b>to</b> <b>avert</b> an imaginary military coup against him.

40|$|This {{research}} extends prior work on von Grünau and Anston 2 ̆ 7 s (1995) stare-in-the-crowd effect whereby direct gaze relative <b>to</b> <b>averted</b> gaze {{is detected}} faster in visual search tasks. No research has yet explicitly investigated {{the effect of}} varying {{the identity of the}} facial stimuli presented to participants. To enhance this paradigm 2 ̆ 7 s ecological validity, the present study varied facial identity over three experiments. Sixty-eight non-clinical adults detected front-facing target faces with both direct and averted gaze from among variable array sizes. Two groups were formed according to high or low scores on the Autism Quotient (AQ) and their reaction times were compared in each experiment. Instead of the expected advantage for direct-gaze detection, between-subjects and within-trials manipulations of facial identity produced a tendency for participants <b>to</b> detect <b>averted</b> gaze more quickly. However, AQ score moderated this tendency: Low-AQ participants detected direct gaze faster, while High-AQ subjects were quicker <b>to</b> detect <b>averted</b> gaze. The limitations and implications of these findings are discussed in the context of previous research findings...|$|R

40|$|International audienceGaze {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} cues for human communication and social interaction. In particular, gaze contact is the most primary form of social contact and it is thought to capture attention. A very early-differentiated brain response <b>to</b> direct versus <b>averted</b> gaze has been hypothesized. Here, we used high-density electroencephalography to test this hypothesis. Topographical analysis allowed us to uncover a very early topographic modulation (40 – 80 ms) of event-related responses to faces with direct as compared <b>to</b> <b>averted</b> gaze. This modulation was obtained only in the condition where intact broadband faces–as opposed to high-pass or low-pas filtered faces–were presented. Source estimation indicated that this early modulation involved the posterior parietal region, encompassing the left precuneus and inferior parietal lobule. This supports the idea that it reflected an early orienting response <b>to</b> direct versus <b>averted</b> gaze. Accordingly, in a follow-up behavioural experiment, we found faster response times to the direct gaze than <b>to</b> the <b>averted</b> gaze broadband faces. In addition, classical evoked potential analysis showed that the N 170 peak amplitude was larger for averted gaze than for direct gaze. Taken together, these results suggest that direct gaze may be detected at a very early processing stage, involving a parallel route to the ventral occipito-temporal route of face perceptual analysis...|$|R
