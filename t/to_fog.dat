5|$|In {{the third}} round City faced four-time European trophy winners A.C. Milan. The first leg, held at the San Siro, was {{initially}} postponed due <b>to</b> <b>fog,</b> and was instead played the following day. City took a 2–0 lead and came close to becoming the first English team to beat Milan at the San Siro, but conceded twice; the equaliser scored eight minutes from time. City won the home leg 3–0, with goals from Booth, Hartford and Kidd. City's first European quarter-final since 1971 was against Borussia Mönchengladbach. The club received advice from Bob Paisley, whose Liverpool had met Mönchengladbach several times. City opened the scoring in the first leg, but while attempting to extend their lead were caught on the counter-attack and conceded an equaliser. After failing to win the home leg, having conceded an away goal in the process, City travelled to Germany with few expecting them to progress. So it proved, as City lost 3–1 at the Bökelbergstadion.|$|E
5|$|Starting in fall 1942, {{large numbers}} of Soviet {{soldiers}} arrived in Fairbanks {{to work with the}} U.S. soldiers already in the town. The massive Lend-Lease effort required additional facilities to be built in and near Fairbanks. Ladd Field expanded in size, and the grounds of the U.S. Army post expanded until it met the city limits of Fairbanks. The University of Alaska, which saw most of its students taken up by the draft, provided office and dormitory space for U.S. and Soviet soldiers. Its professors also contributed to the war effort with specially created Russian language classes. Russian airmen were regular customers of Fairbanks stores, and they bought large amounts of consumer goods unavailable at home. To meet demand when Ladd Field was unusable due <b>to</b> <b>fog,</b> an airfield now known as Eielson Air Force Base was built southeast of Fairbanks. Although there were some conflicts between Soviet and U.S. soldiers and civilians, Lend-Lease operations in Fairbanks continued {{through the end of the}} war, and when Lend-Lease ended in September 1945, 7,926 aircraft and tons of cargo had been transferred to Soviet officials in Fairbanks.|$|E

40|$|Summary Five-year-old {{red spruce}} saplings (Picea rubens Sarg.) {{were exposed to}} either (1) acid fog {{consisting}} of a mixture of H 2 SO 4 and HNO 3 adjusted to pH 2. 5, (2) distilled-water fog at pH 5. 6, or (3) no fog (dry control) for 3. 5 hours per day, {{five times a week}} during the 1996 and 1997 growing seasons. The effect of fog on cell membrane-associated cal-cium (mCa) of leaf mesophyll cells was investigated with the fluorescence probe chlortetracycline (CTC). In both years, mean mCa concentrations were significantly less in needles exposed <b>to</b> acid <b>fog</b> than in needles exposed <b>to</b> distilled-water <b>fog</b> or in untreated needles. In 1997, acid-fog treatment resulted in 25 and 12 % reductions in mCa in current-year needles, and 18 and 15 % reductions in 1 -year-old needles, compared with untreated needles and needles exposed <b>to</b> distilled-water <b>fog,</b> respectively, indicating that acid deposition induced calcium leaching from the membranes of photosynthetic mesophyll cells. Exposure <b>to</b> distilled-water <b>fog</b> also led <b>to</b> reductions in mCa in young needles, suggesting that water films on needle surfaces can induce losses by diffusion between the needle interior and surface. Consistent with the chamber studies, field data obtained from red spruce trees at two sites in Maine showed that low mCa concentrations in needles were associ-ated with exposure <b>to</b> acid <b>fog...</b>|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Freezing of gait (FOG) is both {{common and}} {{debilitating}} {{in patients with}} Parkinson's disease (PD). Future pathophysiology studies will depend critically upon adequate classification of patients as being either 'freezers' or 'non-freezers'. This classification should be based ideally upon objective confirmation by an experienced observer during clinical assessment. Given the known difficulties <b>to</b> elicit <b>FOG</b> when examining patients, we aimed to investigate which simple clinical test {{would be the most}} sensitive <b>to</b> provoke <b>FOG</b> objectively. METHODS: We examined 50 patients with PD, including 32 off-state freezers (defined as experiencing subjective 'gluing of the feet to the floor'). Assessment including a FOG trajectory (three trials: normal speed, fast speed, and with dual tasking) and several turning variants (180 degrees vs. 360 degrees turns; leftward vs. rightward turns; wide vs. narrow turning; and slow vs. fast turns). RESULTS: Sensitivity of the entire assessment <b>to</b> provoke <b>FOG</b> in subjective freezers was 0. 74, specificity was 0. 94. The most effective test <b>to</b> provoke <b>FOG</b> was rapid 360 degrees turns in both directions and, if negative, combined with a gait trajectory with dual tasking. Repeated testing improved the diagnostic yield. The least informative tests included wide turns, 180 degrees turns or normal speed full turns. Sensitivity <b>to</b> provoke objective <b>FOG</b> in subjective freezers was 0. 65 for the rapid full turns in both directions and 0. 63 for the FOG trajectory. DISCUSSION: The most efficient way <b>to</b> objectively ascertain <b>FOG</b> is asking patients to repeatedly make rapid 360 degrees narrow turns from standstill, on the spot and in both directions...|$|R

To prevent fogging many divers spit into the dry mask before use, spread the saliva around {{the inside of the}} glass and rinse it out with a little water. The saliva residue allows condensation to wet the glass and form a continuous film, rather than tiny droplets. There are several commercial products that can be used as an alternative to saliva, some of which are more effective and last longer, but there is a risk of getting the anti-fog agent in the eyes.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, Braathens SAFE {{established}} their technical base at the airport, but left two years later. Gardermoen also became the reserve airport for Oslo Airport, Fornebu, when {{the latter was}} closed due <b>to</b> <b>fog.</b> From 1946 to 1952, when a longer runway was built at Fornebu, all intercontinental traffic was moved to Gardermoen. Gardermoen grew up as a training field for the commercial airlines and as local airport for general aviation. Some commercial traffic returned again in 1960, when SAS received its first Sud Aviation Caravelle jet aircraft, that could not use the runway at Fornebu until it was extended again in 1962. SAS introduced a direct flight to New York in 1962, but it was quickly terminated.|$|E
25|$|From there Kayser {{travelled}} to Bergen, {{where he}} involved {{himself in the}} illegal press. After some time {{he decided to take}} part in secret military and sabotage operations. He escaped to England in September 1941, and enrolled in the Norwegian Independent Company 1 led by Martin Linge. Kayser was recruited from the regular training to the so-called Finishing School, where the emphasis was on secret agent skills. His first mission was the Operation Anklet in December 1941. In 1942 he planned Operation Woodcock together with Kasper Idland and Kjell Endresen, two other Norwegian Independent Company 1 soldiers. They were to parachute onto the Nevlandsheia plateau in Gjesdal and from there carry out a sabotage operation against the strategically important Sola Air Station in Western Norway. The team's first attempt to carry out the operation failed due <b>to</b> <b>fog</b> obscuring the drop zone. Further attempts were called off after a French sabotage team was intercepted by the Germans and explosives designed for the operation fell into German hands.|$|E

25|$|The first {{civilian}} {{aircraft to}} land was a Douglas DC-3 from Fred. Olsen Airtransport in 1958. The first scheduled flight was a Braathens SAFE Fokker F27 on 13 October, a route that flew daily from Oslo along the South Coast to Stavanger. The construction was completed on 15 September 1959 and the airport was officially opened on 5 October. On 16 October, both Oslo Airport, Fornebu and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen were closed due <b>to</b> <b>fog,</b> and eight scheduled aircraft were rerouted to Sandefjord. The {{name of the}} company was changed to AS Sandefjord Lufthavn in 1960, and the airport named Sandefjord Airport, Torp. Local patriots had expected Braathens SAFE to relocate their route from Jarlsberg to Torp after {{the opening of the}} airport, but this was not carried out. Braathens SAFE received concession in 1960 to fly from Oslo via Sandefjord and Kristiansand to Aalborg in Denmark twice a week. The service was terminated after a single season due to Scandinavian Airlines taking over the route, and removing Sandefjord from the schedule.|$|E
25|$|In January 1945 a {{plan was}} drafted by Generalleutenant Graf von Schmettow to hit back at the Americans occupying the Cherbourg peninsula. Using a number of ships rescued from St Malo and with the {{additional}} objective of boosting morale of German soldiers in the Channel islands a detailed plan was created using information from German prisoners {{who had been in}} Granville and stole a landing craft LCV(P) to escape. Training exercises were undertaken by 800 men in Guernsey, away from the civilian population to avoid the plans being revealed. Work on the ships also had to be kept away from the SS Vega in case the preparations were reported. An idea that a raid was being planned was noticed and a message was sent from Guernsey to France with an escaping OT worker, Xavier Gollivet, who had worked for the German Harbour Master and two local fisherman, Tom and Jack Le Page, it would be ignored. A false start on 6 February due <b>to</b> <b>fog,</b> also risked disclosure of the attack.|$|E
25|$|The {{height of}} S.sempervirens is closely tied <b>to</b> <b>fog</b> availability; taller trees become less {{frequent}} as fog becomes less frequent. As S.sempervirens’ height increases, transporting water via water potential to the leaves becomes increasingly more difficult due to gravity. Despite the high rainfall that the region receives (up to 100cm), the leaves in the upper canopy are perpetually stressed for water. This water stress is exacerbated by long droughts in the summer. Water stress is believed to cause the morphological changes in the leaves, stimulating reduced leaf length and increased leaf succulence. To supplement their water needs, redwoods utilize frequent summer fog events. Fog water is absorbed through multiple pathways. Leaves directly take in fog from the surrounding air through the epidermal tissue, bypassing the xylem. Coast redwoods also absorb water directly through their bark. The uptake of water through leaves and bark repairs and reduces the severity of xylem embolisms, which occur when cavitations form in the xylem preventing the transport of water and nutrients. Fog may also collect on redwood leaves, drip to the forest floor, and be absorbed by the tree's roots. This fog drip may form 30% of the total water used by a tree in a year.|$|E
