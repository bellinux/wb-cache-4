5000|$|White gold's {{properties}} {{vary depending}} on the metals and proportions used. As a result, white gold alloys can be used for many different purposes; while a nickel alloy is hard and strong and therefore good for rings and pins, gold-palladium alloys are soft, pliable and good for white gold gemstone settings, sometimes with other metals like copper, silver, and platinum for weight and durability, although this often requires specialized goldsmiths. The term white gold is used very loosely in the industry to describe karat gold alloys with a whitish hue. It is a common misconception that the color of the <b>rhodium</b> <b>plating,</b> which is seen on many commercial pieces, is actually the color of white gold. The term [...] "white" [...] covers a large spectrum of colors that borders or overlaps pale yellow, tinted brown, and even very pale rose.

RNDr. Václav Nehasil, Dr., Department of surface and plasma science Abstract: In this work, {{we examined the}} suitability of rhodium deposited on a plasma sprayed substrate of titanium dioxide for catalysis reactions. With X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy method, the thermal stability of TiO 2 prepared with plasma spray technology on aluminum plate was tested at first. Then, rhodium was evaporated on substrate and thermal stability of the whole system Rh/TiO 2 was determined. Further methods of thermal desorption spectroscopy and molecular beam were used to study adsorption and desorption of CO and reaction of CO with oxygen. It was verified that the system Rh/TiO 2 ceases to adsorbing CO after heating above 620 K, also the CO reaction with oxygen exhibits considerably lower intensity after heating above 620 K. After calibrating on <b>rhodium</b> <b>plate,</b> {{it was determined that}} the intensity of CO 2 creation on Rh/TiO 2 is four times lower than intensity on the <b>rhodium</b> <b>plate.</b> Unprompted adsorption and desorption passivation of the system, however, seems to be the most significant problem.

40|$|The {{attention}} to a palladium- 103 radionuclide, including in Russia, has arisen rather {{for a long time}} (1 - 3) due to its nuclear- physical characteristics. It has a half-life 17 days (4) and irradiates KX-rays with an energy 20. 55 KeV (5). Palladium- 103 is interesting not only as a source of low energy radiation, but also as a generator of a radionuclide rhodium- 103 m (6). In the last years the interest in this radionuclide has increased sharply perhaps owing to definite success-es in applying of palladium- 103 in brachytherapy and in the treatment of prostate cancer (7, 8).

40|$|For the hydroformylation of 1 -octene in {{supercritical}} {{carbon dioxide}} {{the relationship between the}} change in pressure and the change in reaction mixture composition as a function of time has been investigated. The activity and selectivity has been studied for the catalyst based on tris(3, 5 -bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl) phosphine and rhodium(I) dicarbonyl acetylacetonate. The influence of the ligand <b>to</b> <b>rhodium</b> ratio on the hydroformylation has been used to demonstrate how the pressure can be correlated to the conversion and yield. The initial rate of reaction is in good agreement with the initial pressure change in the batch reactor. Up to an aldehyde yield of 80 %, the pressure drop appears to be independent of the reaction rate and selectivity. The highest average reaction rate,, has been obtained for a ligand <b>to</b> <b>rhodium</b> ratio of 50 and an initial concentration of 1 -octene of 0. 5 mol L- 1.

40|$|The {{coordination}} mode of triphenylphosphine <b>to</b> <b>rhodium</b> {{is considered}} <b>to</b> {{be important for}} the outcome of hydroformylation catalysis.

The DFT-calculated catalytic pathway of the monophosphine-based catalyst shows a lower free energy barrier (24. 5 kcalmol(- 1)) compared to the pathway of the bisphosphine catalyst (28. 9 kcalmol(- 1)). This confirms that monophosphine catalysts have an intrinsically higher activity than bisphosphine catalysts and indicates that the rate enhancement seen with the tetraphenylporphyrin-based catalyst reported by our group previously is at least partly due to the monocoordination enforced by this encapsulating ligand...|$|R

Moreover, pulses of oxygen followed by methane and vice versa as well as pulses of mixtures of methane and labelled oxygen were applied to study the role of chemisorbed oxygen and incorporated oxygen in the reaction mechanism. The decomposition of methane on reduced rhodium results {{in the formation of}} carbon and hydrogen adatoms. During the interaction of pure dioxygen with rhodium the catalyst is almost completely oxidized to Rh 2 O 3. In addition <b>to</b> <b>rhodium</b> oxide, oxygen is also present in the form of chemisorbed oxygen species. During the simultaneous interaction of methane and dioxygen at a stoichiometric feed ratio and a temperature of 973 K only 0. 4 wt% Rh 2 O 3 is present. The chemisorbed oxygen species are completely desorbed after 2 s. A Mars–Van Krevelen mechanism is postulated: methane reduces the rhodium oxide, which is reoxidized by dioxygen. Synthesis gas is produced as primary product. Hydrogen is formed via the associative desorption of two hydrogen adatoms from reduced rhodium and the reaction between carbon adatoms and oxygen present as rhodium oxide results in the formation of carbon monoxide. The consecutive oxidation of CO and H 2 proceeds via both chemisorbed oxygen and oxygen present as rhodium oxide. Continuous flow experiments were performed <b>to</b> compare <b>rhodium</b> and platinum. When compared <b>to</b> platinum, <b>rhodium</b> shows a higher conversion to methane at a comparable temperature and also a higher selectivity to both CO and H 2, the difference for CO being most pronounced. The observed differences in methane conversion and selectivities for the two catalysts are ascribed to the higher activation energy for methane decomposition on platinum compared <b>to</b> <b>rhodium.</b> An additional explanation for the difference in H 2 selectivity could be the higher activation energy for OH formation on <b>rhodium</b> compared <b>to</b> platinum...|$|R
