5|$|Winter {{sports have}} {{traditionally}} been second to summer pursuits in Australian sporting culture, but interest and support in the former has grown. The decision-making bodies of the Australian Olympic Federation (AOF) allowed winter sports <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented,</b> but their representatives were usually overruled by their summer counterparts.|$|E
5|$|A {{defendant}} must {{be given}} an opportunity to retain counsel, even if not entitled to appointed counsel. Subject to considerations such as conflicts of interest, scheduling, counsel's authorization to practice law in the jurisdiction, and counsel's willingness to represent the defendant (whether pro bono or for a fee), criminal defendants have a right <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> by counsel of their choice. The remedy for erroneous depravation of first choice counsel is automatic reversal.|$|E

5|$|Following {{a review}} of {{parliamentary}} representation in Greater Manchester, Atherton {{is part of the}} Bolton West Parliamentary constituency. It is the only ward in the borough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> outside a Wigan borough seat (the remainder of the borough is represented by Leigh, Makerfield or Wigan). Atherton's MP is Chris Green (politician) who won the parliamentary seat for Bolton West at the 2015 General Election. Howe Bridge is in the Leigh constituency represented by Jo Platt.|$|E
5|$|Greece, Australia, France, and United Kingdom are {{the only}} {{countries}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> at every Olympic Games since their inception in 1896. While countries sometimes miss an Olympics {{due to a lack}} of qualified athletes, some choose to boycott a celebration of the Games for various reasons. The Olympic Council of Ireland boycotted the 1936 Berlin Games, because the IOC insisted its team needed to be restricted to the Irish Free State rather than representing the entire island of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|It is {{no longer}} {{possible}} for active parliamentarians to sit on the committee, except for the last half year of parliamentary representation, if they have stated that they will not run for re-election. This allowed Jagland and Valle to sit on the committee in 2009, while they were still elected. The appointment is made by parliament after nominations by the parties who are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> in the committee. In 2009, the Labour Party had two seats, while the three next-largest parties, the Progress Party, the Conservative Party and the Socialist Left Party, each have one representative. The remaining parties in parliament are not represented.|$|E

5|$|Local {{churches were}} further {{organized}} into geographically defined presbyteries. A presbytery was {{a convention of}} all ministers within its jurisdiction and one ruling elder chosen by each session. Collegiate churches were entitled <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> by two or more ruling elders {{in proportion to the}} number of its pastors. Presbyteries were responsible for examining, licensing and ordaining candidates to the ministry, as well as judging and removing ministers. They were also responsible for resolving doctrinal or disciplinary questions and also functioned as courts of appeal from sessions. An executive commission was appointed to more efficiently manage the presbytery's work, and judicial cases were referred to a judicial commission.|$|E
5|$|On 29 November 1941, Heydrich sent invitations for a {{ministerial conference}} {{to be held}} on 9 December at the offices of Interpol at 16 Am Kleinen Wannsee. He changed the venue on 4 December to the {{eventual}} location of the meeting. He enclosed {{a copy of a}} letter from Göring dated 31 July that authorised him to plan a so-called Final solution to the Jewish question. The ministries <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> were Interior, Justice, the Four-year plan, Propaganda, and the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories.|$|E
5|$|The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature {{requires}} {{each species}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> by a type collection. The destruction of Burret's type collections left many species only known from his original descriptions, which generally lacked illustrations. Other specimens (called neotypes) were designated to replace these, either by Rodrigo Bernal and colleagues in 1989 or by Borchsenius and Bernal in their 1996 monograph of the genus. Bernal and colleagues attempted to retrace Kalbreyer's travels in northern Colombia and collect specimens from {{as close as}} possible to the location of the original collections.|$|E

Confident of his acquittal, Bellingham refused to discuss the case further with Harmer, and spent the afternoon and evening making notes. After drinking a glass of porter, he went to bed and slept soundly.|$|E
5|$|An arc diagram or linear {{embedding}} places vertices of a graph along a line, {{and draws}} {{the edges of}} the graph as semicircles either above or below this line, sometimes also allowing edges to be drawn on segments of the line. This drawing style corresponds to a book embedding with either one page (if all semicircles are above the line) or two pages (if both sides of the line are used), and was originally introduced as a way of studying the crossing numbers of graphs. Planar graphs that do not have two-page book embeddings may also be drawn in a similar way, by allowing their edges <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> by multiple semicircles above and below the line. Such a drawing is not a book embedding by the usual definition, but has been called a topological book embedding. For every planar graph, it is always possible to find such an embedding in which each edge crosses the spine at most once.|$|E
5|$|Further {{recognition}} {{came with}} the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung {{at the same time}} included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented.</b> A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme... The details of the picture disclose untiring care.|$|E

5|$|In January 2009 the International Baseball Federation {{created a}} ranking {{system so that}} the nations {{involved}} in international competition could be compared independently. Teams receive points based on the position they finish {{at the end of}} tournaments. The system takes into account results not only of the senior men's teams but also of junior teams. Weightings that emphasise the importance of certain tournaments are {{based on the number of}} teams competing, the number of continents represented (or eligible <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented),</b> and in the case of continental tournaments such as the Oceania Baseball Championship the relative strength of teams eligible. Only results within the previous four years are used, so points are added and removed over time. Since the system began, the rankings have been adjusted after the completion of tournaments qualifying for the ranking process; the most recent was the 2009 Baseball World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Other {{countries}} considered similar memorials. The US {{constructed a}} Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in 1921; while {{the idea was}} clearly a foreign concept, it proved very popular with the American public and by 1936 was attracting over 1.5 m visitors a year and acting as an informal national monument to the war. Edwin Redslob, part of the German government, supported a similar scheme in 1925, but without success, and Mainz Cathedral and Ulm Minster were later proposed as options for a tomb. In Germany, a tomb was not finally built until 1935, when it {{was sponsored by the}} Nazi government; the final memorial contained 20 bodies of unknown German soldiers from the Eastern front. Other countries also constructed tombs, including Belgium and Portugal, and as in France and Britain these tombs were placed in capital cities; there was an abortive attempt to place the Romanian tomb at Mărăşeşti, but this proved impractical for both logistic and ceremonial reasons. Canada, Australia and New Zealand declined to build their own tombs, as they were considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> by the burial in London.|$|E
5|$|Protein {{structures}} have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> in some coordinate-independent {{space to}} make them comparable. This is typically achieved by constructing a sequence-to-sequence matrix or series of matrices that encompass comparative metrics: rather than absolute distances relative to a fixed coordinate space. An intuitive representation is the distance matrix, which is a two-dimensional matrix containing all pairwise distances between some subset of the atoms in each structure (such as the alpha carbons). The matrix increases in dimensionality {{as the number of}} structures to be simultaneously aligned increases. Reducing the protein to a coarse metric such as secondary structure elements (SSEs) or structural fragments can also produce sensible alignments, despite the loss of information from discarding distances, as noise is also discarded. Choosing a representation to facilitate computation is critical to developing an efficient alignment mechanism.|$|E

5|$|The {{locomotive}} {{classes were}} all pre-chosen by BR, but the various regions {{were free to}} choose, within certain parameters, which specific locomotives were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented.</b> Tasked with supplying a suitable Coronation, the London Midland Region (LMR) selected No. 46236 City of Bradford. Regions were also free to choose their drivers. To drive the engine throughout, the LMR chose driver Byford from Camden shed who was seen to be sufficiently experienced. City of Bradford was then tested on its home ground between London Euston and Carlisle, on the Eastern Region (ER) between London Kings Cross and Leeds, on the Western Region (WR) between London Paddington and Plymouth, then finally on the Southern Region (SR) between London Waterloo and Exeter.|$|E
5|$|When Afonso VI's {{younger brother}} Peter II {{replaced}} {{him on the}} throne, in 1667, he adapted the flag's crown to fit the contemporary trends by transforming it into a five-arched crown. The new flag did not remain unchanged for too long, as it was refurbished by Peter's son John V, after he took the throne, in 1707. Heavily influenced by the luxurious and ostentatious court of the French king Louis XIV, and by France's political and cultural impact in Europe, John V wanted to transpose such style into the country's coat of arms. A red beret was then added under the crown. Besides the change of the crown, the shields started <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented,</b> on the flags, {{not only in the}} traditional round bottom shape ("Iberian type"), but also in other formats like the samnitic ("French type"), the horsehead ("Italian type") or the oval ("cartouche") shapes. Instated by an absolute monarch like John V, this flag endured through almost the entire absolutist period in Portugal—John V (1707–1750), Joseph I (1750–1777) and Maria I (1777–1816).|$|E
5|$|As the {{representative}} of Warsaw, he was elected a deputy to the Sejms of 1784 and 1786, {{as well as to}} the Great Sejm (1788–1892). In the meantime, in February 1789, he was elected mayor of Warsaw; he would be reelected in 1790 (as a mayor of Warsaw, he succeeded Wojciech Lobert, and would in turn be succeeded by Józef Michał Łukasiewicz). During the Great Sejm, together with Hugo Kołłątaj, Dekert organized the confederation of 141 cities and towns and was at the forefront of demanding the representations and enfranchisement of the burghers in the Sejm; notably, he helped organize the Black Procession on 2 December 1789 (a march of burghers who delivered a petition to the king). The burghers demanded similar privileges to those held by the nobles (szlachta). Their demands included the right to buy and own land estates, the right <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> in the Polish parliament (Sejm) and reforms to the urban law. The procession influenced the Great Sejm to create a Commission for the Cities (Deputacja w sprawie miast) tasked with addressing those concerns during the works on the new constitution.|$|E
