5|$|Vision is {{generated}} by light <b>that</b> <b>hits</b> the retina of the eye. Photoreceptors in the retina transduce the sensory stimulus of light into an electrical nerve signal that {{is sent to the}} visual cortex in the occipital lobe. Vision from the left visual field is received {{on the right side of}} each retina (and vice versa) and passes through the optic nerve until some information changes sides, so that all information about one side of the visual field passes through tracts in the opposite side of the brain. The nerves reach the brain at the lateral geniculate nucleus, and travel through the optic radiation to reach the visual cortex.|$|E

5|$|Sheila Canning (Colette Mann) {{encourages}} Paul {{to start}} dating again, {{and he has}} a number of casual relationships using a dating app. He falls out with Daniel when he puts his romance with Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow) before work. After they argue, Daniel and Amber go out into a tornado <b>that</b> <b>hits</b> Erinsborough. Paul goes after them and his car is hit by a dislodged skip. Daniel and Amber rescue him. He suffers broken ribs and a cracked prosthetic. Paul decides he is ready to be mayor again and organises a media gathering at Sonya's Nursery, {{but it has to be}} postponed when the nursery is vandalised. Paul discovers Jayden Warley (Khan Oxenham) was behind the vandalism, and he blackmails Jayden's mother Sue Parker (Kate Gorman) into stepping down as interim mayor. Dakota Davies (Sheree Murphy), a fling from Paul's time in Brazil, arrives in Erinsborough and tells Paul that he abandoned her without explanation to return to Australia in 2004. Paul's memories of this are unclear due to his brain tumour, but he agrees to help her set up a bar. Paul falls in love with Dakota, but he soon learn that she is involved in diamond smuggling. She leaves after asking him for money.|$|E
5|$|The family becomes {{increasingly}} frightened and distrustful of him, especially when his latest advice leads Hayley {{to be attacked}} by a shark. With the shark loose in the house, the family fights for survival. Stan loses hope and admits Francine's suggestions are better than his own, until Klaus gives him an encouragement speech which inspires him to prove himself reliable in a crisis once more. Stan obtains a bear from the zoo to battle the shark, which only further aggravates the situation when the two animals work together to kill the family. Refusing to accept Francine's pleas to just get help, Stan instead throws a javelin <b>that</b> <b>hits</b> his wife in her shoulder instead of the bear. Buckle enters {{the house with a}} tranquilizer gun and sedates the two predators before also shooting Stan, who later tells Buckle that he made the right call. Despite the whole ordeal, Stan is no longer convinced that he should stay out of a future crisis.|$|E

25|$|Henry Chadwick, an English {{statistician}} {{raised on}} cricket, was an influential {{figure in the}} early history of baseball. In the late 19th century he adapted the concept behind the cricket batting average to devise a similar statistic for baseball. Rather than simply copy cricket's formulation of runs scored divided by outs, he realized <b>that</b> <b>hits</b> divided by at bats would provide a better measure of individual batting ability. This is because while in cricket, scoring runs is almost entirely dependent on one's own batting skill, in baseball it is largely dependent on having other good hitters on one's team. Chadwick noted <b>that</b> <b>hits</b> are independent of teammates' skills, so used this {{as the basis for the}} baseball batting average. His reason for using at bats rather than outs is less obvious, but it leads to the intuitive idea of the batting average being a percentage reflecting how often a batter gets on base, whereas in contrary, hits divided by outs is not as simple to interpret in real terms.|$|E

50|$|The 1998 Comfrey-St. Peter tornado {{outbreak}} was an unseasonably-strong tornado outbreak which {{affected the}} Upper Midwest {{region of the}} United States on March 29, 1998. Sixteen tornadoes struck across the region—fourteen in Minnesota and two in Wisconsin. Thirteen of the tornadoes in Minnesota were spawned by a single supercell thunderstorm. Two people were killed, and 21 others were injured. Most of the damage was caused by three tornadoes—one rated F4 on the Fujita scale <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> the town of Comfrey, Minnesota, an F3 <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> St. Peter, Minnesota, and an F2 <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> Le Center, Minnesota.|$|R

25|$|The {{placement}} of energy attenuation devices (e.g. guardrails, wide grassy areas, sand barrels) is also common. Some road fixtures such as road signs and fire hydrants {{are designed to}} collapse on impact. Light poles are designed to break at the base rather than violently stop a car <b>that</b> <b>hits</b> them. Highway authorities may also remove larger trees from the immediate vicinity of the road. During heavy rains, if the elevation of the road surface isn't higher than the surrounding landscape, it may result in flooding.|$|E
25|$|Targets were to {{have been}} Marcello Dell'Utri and former Defence Minister Cesare Previti, both close {{advisers}} of then Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, according to a leaked report of the intelligence service SISDE. Riina and Bagarella felt betrayed by political allies in Rome, who had promised to help pass laws to ease prison conditions and reduce sentences for its jailed members in exchange for Mafia support at the polls. The SISDE report says they believed <b>that</b> <b>hits</b> on {{either of the two}} embattled members of Berlusconi's Forza Italia party, each under separate criminal indictments, would have been less likely to provoke the kind of public outrage and police crackdown that followed the 1992 murders of the widely admired Sicilian prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino.|$|E
25|$|A {{legal service}} starts a rally, {{in which the}} players {{alternate}} hitting the ball across the net. A legal return consists of the player or team hitting the ball before it has bounced twice or hit any fixtures except the net, provided that it still falls in the server's court. A player or team cannot hit the ball twice in a row. The ball must travel past the net into the other players' court. A ball <b>that</b> <b>hits</b> the net during a rally is still considered a legal return {{as long as it}} crosses into {{the opposite side of the}} court. The first player or team to fail to make a legal return loses the point. The server then moves to the other side of the service line at the start of a new point.|$|E

Imogen Willis asks him to move on, but when she finds he has not, she brings Paul Robinson to ask him instead. Paul is happy to see his nephew and asks him to stay. Daniel agrees after seeing how unpopular and lonely his Uncle Paul has become. He starts working at Lassiter's Hotel and he also clashes with Imogen again. Daniel bonds with Amber Turner over their shared love of photography, and Daniel assures her boyfriend, Josh, {{that they have a}} platonic connection.

25|$|Havens {{with the}} {{touching}} definition {{are closely related}} to brambles, families of connected subgraphs of a given graph that all touch each other. The order of a bramble is the minimum number of vertices needed in a set of vertices <b>that</b> <b>hits</b> all of the subgraphs in the family. The set of flaps '(X) for a haven of order k (with the touching definition) forms a bramble of order at least k, because any set Y of fewer than k vertices fails to hit the subgraph '(Y). Conversely, from any bramble of order k, one may construct a haven of the same order, by defining '(X) (for each choice of X) to be the X-flap that includes all of the subgraphs in the bramble that are disjoint fromX. The requirement that the subgraphs in the bramble all touch each other can be used to show that this X-flap exists, and that all of the flaps '(X) chosen in this way touch each other. Thus, a graph has a bramble of order k if and only if it has a haven of orderk.|$|E
25|$|Jepsen has {{described}} {{the removal of the}} filters that color the RGB subpixels as the critical design innovation in the new LCD. Instead of using subtractive color filters, the display uses a plastic diffraction grating and lenses on the rear of the LCD to illuminate each pixel. This grating pattern is stamped using the same technology used to make DVDs. The grating splits the light from the white backlight into a spectrum. The red, green and blue components are diffracted into the correct positions to illuminate the corresponding pixel with R, G or B. This innovation results in a much brighter display for a given amount of backlight illumination: while the color filters in a regular display typically absorb 85% of the light <b>that</b> <b>hits</b> them, this display absorbs little of that light. Most LCD screens at the time used cold cathode fluorescent lamp backlights which were fragile, difficult or impossible to repair, required a high voltage power supply, were relatively power-hungry, and accounted for 50% of the screens' cost (sometimes 60%). The LED backlight in the XO-1 is easily replaceable, rugged, and inexpensive.|$|E
