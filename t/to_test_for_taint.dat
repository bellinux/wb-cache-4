40|$|Genetically {{reducing}} {{boar taint}} using low-taint lines {{is considered the}} most sustainable and economic long-term alternative to surgical castration of male pigs. Owing to the high heritability of the main boar taint components (androstenone, skatole and indole), breeding is an excellent tool for {{reducing the number of}} tainted carcasses. To incorporate boar taint into breeding programmes, standardized performance testing is required. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop and formally present a performance <b>test</b> <b>for</b> the main boar taint compounds on live breeding candidates. First, a standardized performance <b>test</b> <b>for</b> boar <b>taint</b> was established. A biopsy device was developed to extract small tissue samples (200 to 300 mg) from breeding candidates. Quantification of boar taint components from these small samples using specialized chemical extraction methods proved accurate and repeatable (r = 0. 938). Following establishment of the method, biopsy samples of 516 live boars (100 to 130 kg live weight) were collected in the second step. Various mixed linear models were <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> each boar <b>taint</b> compound; models were ranked in terms of their information content. Pedigree information of 2245 ancestors of biopsied animals was included, and genetic parameters were estimated using univariate and multivariate models. Androstenone (in μg/g liquid fat (LF) : mean = 0. 578, σ = 0. 527), skatole (in μg/g LF: mean = 0. 033, σ = 0. 002) and indole (in μg/g LF: mean = 0. 032, σ = 0. 002) levels obtained by biopsy were plausible. Heritability estimates for androstenone calculated with univariate (0. 453) and multivariate (0. 452) analyses were comparable to those in the literature. Heritabilities for skatole (0. 495) and indole (0. 550) were higher than that for androstenone. Genetic and phenotypic correlations were similar to those published previously. Our results show that data on boar taint compounds from small adipose samples obtained by biopsy provide similar genetic parameters as that described in the literature for larger samples and are therefore a reliable performance <b>test</b> <b>for</b> boar <b>taint</b> in live breeding candidate...|$|R

Residuals from the full mixed model displayed good constancy of variance. We used the Levene <b>test</b> <b>for</b> homogeneity of variance of LFM across prescribed burn seasons (Rx season). ANOVA was used <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> similarity of LFM means between all four sites. Finally, using the lmer function in the lmerTest package (Kuznetsova et al. 2016) in R, we used mixed-effects model <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> effects of our predictor variables on LFM (described below). To remove the effects of multicollinearity in these models, we used sequential regression (Graham 2003) to make our variables orthogonal. Finally, because SR- 14, Temp- 14, and KBDI vary cyclically throughout the year, we included a quadratic term <b>for</b> these variables <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> non-linear effects.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Inoculation of {{planting}} holes with {{small amounts of}} soil from a mature forest and a plantation improved survival and growth of Pseudotsuga menziesii seedlings in a degraded clear-cut in southwestern Oregon. To determine the component(s) of the transferred soil responsible for survival and growth increases, we treated forest, plantation and clear-cut soil with fertilizer <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> a nutrient effect, with dimethoate and carbofuran <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> microarthropod or nematode effects, with fumagillin <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> protozoa effects, with captan <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> fungal effects, with penicillin and oxytetracycline <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> bacterial effects, with pasteurization <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> effects of active forms of organisms, with tyndallization <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> effects of resting forms of organisms, and with water as controls. All biocides significantly reduced the populations of target organisms in the transfer soils, except dimethoate-carbofuran which failed to reduce numbers of microarthropods. All biocides also affected some populations of non-target organisms. Inoculation with tyndallized, pasteurized and captantreated soils increased seedling growth and survival. Inoculation with untreated forest or plantation soils failed to increase diversity of rnycorrhizal types, although they increased numbers of mycorrhizae. Soil transfers with significant effects on seedling rhizospheres {{increased the number of}} Rhizopogon and Thelephora mycorrhizae and decreased the number of active bacteria. It is hypothesized that the role of the transfered soil is not to supply a missing key organism from the soil ecosystem, but to provide a safe site for some organisms, already present in the clear-cut or brought in along with the seedlings, to proliferate in an enivironment free from the influence of a deleterious organism sensitive to heat and captan present in the clear-cut soil.
