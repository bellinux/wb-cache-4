However, the system could only {{be used in the}} manner of a flashlight, pointed in the direction of its target. This was fine for Gun Laying, but in order to be useful in the interception role, the system had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the target anywhere in front of the fighter. The team began to consider different ways to scan the radar beam to produce a search function.|$|E

She died before Kōsei's qualification to what supposedly was his first competition in Europe. She appears in front of Kōsei many times throughout the show.|$|E
25|$|As most cave diving {{is done in}} an {{environment}} where there is no free surface with breathable air allowing an above-water exit, it is critically important <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the way out before the breathing gas runs out. This is ensured by the use of a continuous guideline between the dive team and outside of the flooded cave, and diligent planning and monitoring of gas supplies. Two basic types of guideline are used: permanent lines, and temporary lines. Permanent lines may include a main line starting near the entrance/exit, and side lines or branch lines, and are marked to indicate the direction to the nearest exit. Temporary lines include exploration lines and jump lines.|$|E

25|$|Non-bioluminescent fireflies use pheromones {{to signal}} mates. This is {{supported}} by the fact that some basal groups do not show bioluminescence and use chemical signaling, instead. Phosphaenus hemipterus has photic organs, yet is a diurnal firefly and displays large antennae and small eyes. These traits strongly suggest pheromones are used for sexual selection, while photic organs are used for warning signals. In controlled experiments, males coming from downwind arrived at females first, indicating males travel upwind along a pheromone plume. Males were also found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> females without the use of visual cues, when the sides of test Petri dishes were covered with black tape. This and the facts that females do not light up at night and males are diurnal point to the conclusion that sexual communication in P. hemipterus is based entirely on pheromones.|$|E
25|$|Performance jobs include {{playing as}} a freelancer in small groups, {{playing in a}} chamber music group, large ensembles, or {{performing}} solo music, either live onstage or as a session player for radio or TV broadcasts or for recordings; and working as the employee of an orchestra, big band, or recording studio. Many cello players find extra work by substituting ("subbing") for cellists who are double-booked or ill. It is hard for many cello players <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> full-time, full-year work at a single job. About the closest that a cellist can come to {{this is in the}} case of those who win an audition at a professional orchestra. Even full-time orchestra jobs do not usually last for the entire year. When the orchestra stops playing (which is often in the summer), orchestral cellists have to find other work, either as a teacher or coach, or in another group.|$|E
25|$|When Jeopardy! {{made the}} move on December 31, 1984, WABC {{was looking to}} improve its ratings in the hour leading up to Eyewitness News at 5:00p.m.. Jeopardy! helped, but the station did not seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a {{complementary}} program for it at 4:30p.m.. The station first tried Name That Tune as the accompanying program, but the show had already been struggling in the ratings in its earlier morning timeslot and did not fare better. Thus, WABC moved it to a late-night timeslot and added Divorce Court in its place in early 1985. While Divorce Court was popular, the fictional court program switched stations for the fall of 1985. WABC responded by signing on as an affiliate for the syndicated edition of Sale of the Century, which had been airing on WOR since its January 1985 premiere and was entering its second season that fall. But once again, the station was left needing another solution, as Sale became the third straight problematic Jeopardy! lead-out program and was cancelled by its syndicator in 1986.|$|E

25|$|Startups usually need to form {{partnerships}} with other firms to enable their business model to operate. To become attractive to other businesses, startups need to align their internal features, such as management style and products {{with the market}} situation. In their 2013 study, Kask and Linton develop two ideal profiles, or also known as configurations or archetypes, for startups that are commercializing inventions. The inheritor profile calls for a management style that is not too entrepreneurial (more conservative) and the startup should have an incremental invention (building on a previous standard). This profile is {{set out to be}} more successful (in finding a business partner) in a market that has a dominant design (a clear standard is applied in this market). In contrast to this profile is the originator which has a management style that is highly entrepreneurial and in which a radical invention or a disruptive innovation (totally new standard) is being developed. This profile is set out to be more successful (in finding a business partner) in a market that does not have a dominant design (established standard). New startups should align themselves to one of the profiles when commercializing an invention <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> and be attractive to a business partner. By finding a business partner a startup will have greater chances to become successful.|$|E
25|$|Márquez {{moved up}} to the {{lightweight}} division in order to fight The Ring Lightweight Champion Joel Casamayor on the weekend leading up to Mexican Independence Day at the MGM Grand, Las Vegas, Nevada. On September 13, 2008, he defeated Casamayor in the 11th round after two knockdowns and captured his sixth world title in three different weight classes. In the first four rounds of the bout, Márquez continually walked into counter punches from Casamayor. It took Márquez until the fifth round <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the range with his right hand. By the fifth round, a cut over Casamayor's right eye was opened from a clash of heads. Rounds five, six, seven and eight were rounds where Márquez landed straight punches from the outside, {{but he was also}} struck by Casamayor whenever he lunged forward. Two minutes into the eleventh round, Casamayor was knocked down by a right punch as he pulled away from an intense exchange. Casamayor was able to get on his feet, but it was clear he was still shakey from the knockdown. As soon as the action was allowed to resume, Márquez went in for the kill as he let his punches go in furious combination. Casamayor punched back, but he was knocked down again with about 7 seconds left in the round. Referee Tony Weeks stepped in the bout and stopped the fight as he deemed Casamayor unable to continue. The official judges had the fight scored 95–95, 95–95 and 97–93 for Márquez before the 11th-round knockout. After the win, The Ring magazine ranked Márquez second on its pound for pound list and rated him the number one boxer in the lightweight division.|$|E
