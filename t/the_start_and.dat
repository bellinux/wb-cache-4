5|$|Because {{the rail}} {{operators}} are government-assisted, profit-based corporations, fares on the MRT system are pitched {{to at least}} break-even level. The operators collect these fares by selling electronic data-storing tickets, the prices of which are calculated based on the distance between <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>and</b> destination stations. These prices increase in fixed stages for standard non-discounted travel. Fares are calculated in increments based on approximate distances between stations, {{in contrast to the}} use of fare zones in other subway systems, such as the London Underground.|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  3, <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>and</b> ending {{points of the}} {{utterance}} /ha/ may be identified from the patterns of the first <b>and</b> second derivatives. <b>The</b> <b>starting</b> <b>and</b> ending point candidates of utterance /ha/ in the subband at 250 Hz are located at frames 6 and 33, respectively.

These observations indicate that not all subband signals {{may contribute to the}} VAD decision. Therefore, we calculate the first and second derivatives for the individual subbands to obtain the speech period candidates.|$|R

5|$|Oxford won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Middlesex station, handing the Surrey {{side of the river}} to Cambridge. At the time of the race, which {{commenced}} at 10.40am, there was a strong easterly wind. With a higher stroke rate than their opponents, the Light Blues took the lead from <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>and</b> by Craven Steps were almost clear. At the Mile Post, Oxford had cut the lead to half a length, but were forced to take evasive action to avoid a collision with river traffic.|$|E
5|$|Races with hurdles as {{obstacles}} {{were first}} popularised in the 19th century in England. The first known event, held in 1830, was {{a variation of}} the 100-yard dash that included heavy wooden barriers as obstacles. A competition between the Oxford and Cambridge Athletic Clubs in 1864 refined this, holding a 120-yard race (110m) with ten hurdles of 3-foot and 6inches (1.06m) in height (each placed 10 yards (9m) apart), with the first and final hurdles 15 yards from <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>and</b> finish, respectively. French organisers adapted the race into metric (adding 28cm) and the basics of this race, the men's 110 metres hurdles, has remained largely unchanged. The origin of the 400 metres hurdles also lies in Oxford, where (around 1860) a competition was held over 440yards and twelve 1.06m high wooden barriers were placed along the course. The modern regulations stem from the 1900 Summer Olympics: the distance was fixed to 400m while ten 3-foot (91.44cm) hurdles were placed 35m apart on the track, with the first and final hurdles being 45m and 40m away from <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>and</b> finish, respectively. Women's hurdles are slightly lower at 84cm (2ft 9in) for the 100m event and 76cm (2ft 6in) for the 400m event.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Maya civilization {{is divided into}} three {{principal}} periods: the Preclassic, Classic, and Postclassic periods. These were preceded by the Archaic Period, during which the first settled villages and early developments in agriculture emerged. Modern scholars regard these periods as arbitrary divisions of Maya chronology, rather than indicative of cultural evolution or decline. Definitions of <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>and</b> end dates of period spans can vary by as much as a century, depending on the author.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic idea}} behind PRM {{is to take}} random samples from the {{configuration}} space of the robot, testing them for whether {{they are in the}} free space, and use a local planner to attempt to connect these configurations to other nearby configurations. <b>The</b> <b>starting</b> <b>and</b> goal configurations are added in, and a graph search algorithm is applied to the resulting graph to determine a path between <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>and</b> goal configurations.|$|R

Cortana is implemented as a universal search box located alongside <b>the</b> <b>Start</b> <b>and</b> Task View buttons, which can be hidden or condensed to a single button.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had only}} scored 41 runs in four innings between Tests, Harvey was {{retained}} for the Fifth and final Test at The Oval. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Precipitation in the week {{leading up to the}} match had delayed <b>the</b> <b>start,</b> <b>and</b> Yardley’s decision to bat was regarded as a surprise, as the weather suggested that bowlers would enjoy the conditions. This proved to be correct as Australia cut England down for 52 on the first day, with Lindwall (6/20) in particular managing to make the ball bounce at variable heights. Australia had already passed England by the close of play, reaching 2/153. The next day, Harvey came to the crease at 4/243 and quickly displayed the exuberance of youth. He hit Jack Young for a straight-driven four and then pulled him for another. Harvey then succumbed to Eric Hollies for 17, hitting a catch to Young, leaving Australia at 5/265. The Warwickshire spinner noticed this, and delivered a topspinner that dipped more than usual, and the batsman mistimed his off-drive, which went in the air towards mid-off. Australia finished at 389 and then bowled England out for 188 to complete victory by an innings and 149 runs and seal the series 4–0.|$|E

5|$|Brumfield {{considered}} Operation Hump to be {{the least}} successful operation in which the Australian battalion had participated, and he criticised it as being badly conceived from <b>the</b> <b>start,</b> <b>and</b> mounted with too little intelligence or prior reconnaissance. Indeed, from the initial landing zone being occupied by the Viet Cong, failures in the passage of information, the heavy losses suffered by the US 1/503rd Battalion and the subsequent difficulties with casualty evacuation, the operation had not run smoothly. The Australians were vengeful for their losses and wanted to return to collect their dead; however, with 1 RAR absorbed into other operations the planned battalion attack on Hill 82 never occurred. Regardless, further operations followed in the months afterwards, with 1 RAR subsequently employed on Operation New Life in November and December, and later Operation Crimp in the Ho Bo Woods in January 1966. Operation Hump was Brumfield's last, with an old football injury forcing his evacuation to Australia in mid-November. He was subsequently replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Alex Preece.|$|E
5|$|Coalhouse Fort is an {{artillery}} fort {{built in the}} 1860s to guard the lower Thames from seaborne attack. It stands at Coalhouse Point in Essex on the north bank of the river, at a location near East Tilbury that was vulnerable to raiders and invaders. It was the last {{in a series of}} fortifications dating back to the 15th century and was the direct successor to a smaller mid-19th century fort built on the same site. Constructed during a period of tension with France, its location on marshy ground caused problems from <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>and</b> led to a lengthy construction process. The fort was equipped with a variety of large-calibre artillery guns and the most modern defensive facilities at the time, including shell-proof casemates protected by granite facing and cast-iron shields. However, its lengthy construction and the rapid pace of artillery development at the time meant that it was virtually obsolete for its original purpose within a few years of its completion.|$|E
5|$|Descartes {{rejects the}} teleological, or purposive, {{view of the}} {{material}} world that was dominant in the West {{from the time of}} Aristotle. The mind is not viewed by Descartes as part of the material world, and hence is not subject to the strictly mechanical laws of nature. Motion and rest, on the other hand, are properties of the interactions of matter according to eternally fixed mechanical laws. God only sets the whole thing in motion at <b>the</b> <b>start,</b> <b>and</b> later does not interfere except to maintain the dynamical regularities of the mechanical behavior of bodies. Hence there is no real teleology in the movements of bodies since the whole thing reduces to the law-governed collisions and their constant reconfigurations. The conatus is just the tendency of bodies to move when they collide with each other. God may set this activity in motion, but thereafter no new motion or rest can be created or destroyed.|$|E
