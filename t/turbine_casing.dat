40|$|Gas <b>turbines</b> <b>casings</b> are {{susceptible}} to cracking {{at the edge of}} eccentric pin hole, which is the most likely position for crack initiation and propagation. This paper describes the improvement of transient thermal fatigue crack propagation life of gas <b>turbines</b> <b>casings</b> through the application of additional holes. The crack position and direction was determined using non-destructive tests. A series of finite element patterns were developed and tested in ASTM-A 395 elastic perfectly-plastic ductile cast iron. The effect of arrangement of additional holes on transient thermal fatigue behavior of gas <b>turbines</b> <b>casings</b> containing hole edge cracks was investigated. ABAQUS finite element package and Zencrack fracture mechanics code were used for modeling. The effect of the reduction of transient thermal stress distribution around the eccentric pin hole on the transient thermal fatigue crack propagation life of the gas <b>turbines</b> <b>casings</b> was discussed. The result shows that transient thermal fatigue crack propagation life could be extended by applying additional holes of larger diameter and decreased by increasing the vertical distance, angle, and distance between the eccentric pin hole and the additional holes.

50|$|There {{was some}} {{variation}} in engineering among the ships of this class. The most visible was that hulls 24-27, 30-32, 34, 36, 37, 39, and 40 had three stacks instead of four, {{with the middle}} stack being larger as two boiler uptakes were trunked together in it. Most of the ships' direct drive turbines were arranged as in the Smith class on three shafts, with a high-pressure center turbine exhausting to two low-pressure turbines on the outboard shafts. Cruising turbines were also fitted on the outboard shafts in these ships to improve fuel economy at low speeds. However, hulls 26-27, 30-31, and 34 had two turbines on two shafts (Zoelly or Curtis), with cruising stages included in the <b>turbine</b> <b>casings.</b>|$|R

5000|$|During normal cruise flight, {{the engine}} is exposed to many loads such as intense heat and {{centrifugal}} force.

The amount of air leaking around, past the edge of the blades without passing through them is critical to engine performance and fuel efficiency. For this reason since the late 1960s, blade tip sealing has taken on a prominent role in aircraft engine design. The ACC system dynamically controls the High Pressure Turbine (HPT) blade clearance. This can be achieved in numerous ways.|$|E

5|$|The {{flight test}} program was {{hampered}} by {{problems with the}} 747's JT9D engines. Difficulties included engine stalls caused by rapid throttle movements and distortion of the <b>turbine</b> <b>casings</b> after {{a short period of}} service. The problems delayed 747 deliveries for several months; up to 20 aircraft at the Everett plant were stranded while awaiting engine installation. The program was further delayed when one of the five test aircraft suffered serious damage during a landing attempt at Renton Municipal Airport, site of the company's Renton factory. On December 13, 1969 a test aircraft was being taken to have test equipment removed and a cabin installed when pilot Ralph C. Cokely undershot the airport's short runway. The 747's right, outer landing gear was torn off and two engine nacelles were damaged. However, these difficulties did not prevent Boeing from taking a test aircraft to the 28th Paris Air Show in mid-1969, where it was displayed to the public for the first time. The 747 received its FAA airworthiness certificate in December 1969, clearing it for introduction into service.|$|R

40|$|Gas path sealing {{has always}} been a very {{important}} issue for jet engines, and in the last years the consciousness of the presence of a consistent improvement margin for turbine clearances pushed research investments in this direction. The improvement of tip sealing affects specific fuel consumption, service time, and most of the engine performances in general. Usually the main interest in this kind of studies is addressed to the axisymetric deformation of the casings, while in the last times a new concern on asymmetry and on the possibility to assess and control its development has been growing. This work is lined on this trend of research, since it regards the assessment of the thermally generated asymmetry of <b>turbine</b> <b>casings.</b> The study makes use of the nowadays unescapable mean of the finite element analysis, implemented via specific softwares. It is particularly concerned with the very preliminary assessment of the deformation, and it takes the form of the trial of a new methodology for the analysis, with comparison with other experienced techniques.

50|$|The main {{goals for}} Sub Project 2 are {{to select the}} best {{candidate}} alloys for the HP and ID steam turbines operating at high steam temperatures (≥720˚C). A number of nickel-base alloys have been developed whose properties have been proven at the laboratory scale and for small-scale components. The main uncertainty {{in the application of}} these alloys for steam turbine applications is the ability to manufacture, weld and inspect large components. The performance in service presents a much smaller risk since there is confidence that the mechanical behaviour can be modelled {{on the basis of the}} material properties. This philosophy follows the approach applied in the development, demonstration and exploitation of materials technology for 700-720˚C steam turbines in other projects (AD700, COMTES, EON 50plus) where the first commercial steam turbine will enter service without prior operation in a test loop. Following alloy selection, full-scale steam <b>turbine</b> <b>casings</b> and rotor forgings will be manufactured and materials properties demonstrated through implementation of a mechanical testing programme.

The <b>turbine</b> <b>casing</b> and concrete machine block surrounding the power station were destroyed in May 1990 when two steel beams entered the turbine. The resulting force ruined the power station and the dam's control systems, making it impossible to gradually release water from the near-capacity dam by conventional means. An improvised system, placing large pipes over the spillway to siphon water over it, was soon installed, but the inflow from an unusually wet spring was such that the dam would have overflowed anyway, leading to a spectacular cascade over the huge rock steps formed when the rock used for the dam itself was quarried from the valley walls. The station was subsequently re-built and re-commissioned in 1993.|$|E

40|$|International audienceImproving sealing between {{rotating}} and stationary {{parts in}} aerospace gas turbines significantly increases engine performance by improving thermal efficiencies. To reach this aim, abradable seals are being incorporated into <b>turbine</b> <b>casings.</b> With an abradable seal, the blade tips incur into the shroud, {{thereby reducing the}} gap between the rotor and the coating to a minimum. These coatings are generally multiphase materials applied by thermal spray techniques and consisting in a combination of metallic matrix and additional dislocator phases with a controlled amount of porosity. The sealing effectiveness requires a combination of properties that are usually optimised empirically with thermal spray coatings generally made up from a range of two-phase powder mixtures. The present study intends to initiate a theoretical approach for the study of these materials aiming at developing a prediction strategy for structure improvement. Image analyses and finite element calculations were used to examine the effect of phase morphology on the mechanical behaviour of two reference abradable systems, namely AlSi-hBN and NiCrAl-Bentonite for compressor stages. Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) was used to obtain a series of micrographs for coating characterisation. These micrographs were then treated to create equivalent images based on geometrical description of the inherent morphology. The resultant reduced images are used to carry out finite element calculations, {{in order to determine the}} mechanical properties of each coating. It is believed that this approach provides consistent results and is believed to be a reliable starting point for further coatings design...|$|R

The motivation for this work is the blade‐off event that may occur inside a jet engine turbine.

The material used in this study is the FV 535 martensitic stainless steel, {{which is one of the}} most commonly used materials for <b>turbine</b> <b>casings.</b> Based on material test data, a Modified Johnson‐Cook (MJC) model was calibrated for numerical simulations using the LS‐DYNA explicit finite element code (see Figure 1).

Two fixed meshes with 64 and 128 elements over the 2 mm thick plate and one mesh with 32 elements over the thickness with adaptive remeshing were used in the simulations. The formation of adiabatic shear bands in the perforation process has been found critical in order to achieve good results. Adiabatic shear bands are formed by the temperature rise due to the accumulation of plastic strain during impact (see Figure 2).
