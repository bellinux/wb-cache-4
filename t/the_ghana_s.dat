40|$|<b>Ghana</b> <b>s</b> {{efforts to}} {{increase}} yam exports are paying off. With yam one of its principal crops, <b>Ghana</b> is <b>the</b> world <b>s</b> second largest producer of the root, with 3. 25 million tonnes grown in 1999. In 1998 it exported 7, 500 tonnes of yam, mainly to the United Kingdom and the United States, for USD 5 million, accounting for 36 % of world yam exports. Between 1997 and 1998, the area under cultivation grew by almost 13 %. <b>The</b> <b>Ghana</b> Yam Producers and Exporters Association provides its members with technical support with emphasis being given to certain varieties (with tubers weighing between 2 and 3 kg, which is better for the export market), and to post-harvest handling, storage, packaging, quality control and shipping, with details strictly described on the wrappings. These steps {{have been taken to}} meet the requirements of the international markets, and thus to increase sales. They are steps worth taking, since the export yam earns six times more than the domestic market yam. <b>Ghana</b> <b>s</b> yam exports have now outpaced those of Jamaica, Brazil and Côte d Ivoire. Nigeria is the leading world producer with more than 25 million tonnes in 1999, but it consumes the entire crop on <b>the</b> domestic market. <b>Ghana</b> <b>s</b> neighbours - Togo, Benin and Nigeria - also sell their yams in dried baton shapes known as cossettes. These peeled yams are blanched and solar-dried and keep better than fresh yam. At present they are sold on national and regional markets, but they could spread to other markets in the Gulf of Guinea and Europe, where the diaspora has created a potential market.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} <b>the</b> {{threat to}} <b>Ghana</b> <b>s</b> {{peace and stability}} {{as a result of}} ethnic conflict, using the Nkonya-Alavanyo conflict as a case study. The study examines why the conflict has persisted for decades despite numerous intentions for resolution, and the effect of the conflict on the communities involved. Findings from the study indicate that central to the Nkonya-Alavanyo conflict is a parcel of land that has been in dispute for decades. The land has served as a source of conflict {{as a result of its}} economic values. Moreover, the constant reoccurrence of the conflict is a consequence of the land being regarded as a traditional heritage that needs to be protected and secured, regardless of the effect. The consequences of the Nkonya-Alavanyo conflict since it first broke have been devastating; affecting the socio-economic and psychological aspects of the lives of people living in these communities and placing them in a perpetual state of insecurity. The result of the case study indicates that the constant reoccurrence of ethnic conflicts poses a threat to the peace and stability of Ghana. Finally, some recommendations are suggested based on the findings...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{studies the}} multidimensional aspects {{of poverty and}} living {{conditions}} in <b>Ghana.</b> <b>The</b> aim is to fill the vacuum that has been left by traditional uni-dimensional measures of deprivation based on poverty lines, exclusively estimated {{on the basis of}} monetary variables such as income or consumption expenditure. It combines monetary and non-monetary, and qualitative and quantitative indicators, including housing conditions, the possession of durable goods, equivalent disposable income, and equivalent expenditure, with a number of composite human welfare measures. The study employs the fuzzy-set theoretic framework to compare levels of deprivation in Ghana over time usig micro data from the last two rounds of <b>the</b> <b>Ghana</b> Living Standard Surveys (1991 / 1992 and 1998 / 1999). The estimation results of the membership functions, depicting the levels of deprivation for the various categories of deprivation indicators, show a composite deprivation degree of 0. 2137 for the whole country in 1998 / 99 as compared to 0. 2123 in 1991 / 92. This deprivation trend reveals that poverty levels hard scarcely changed in Ghana. In fact, it even rose slightly during the nineties, contrary to the uni-dimensional analytical GLSS 4 report of an overall broadly favourable trend in poverty in <b>Ghana</b> during <b>the</b> 1990 <b>s.</b> <b>Ghana,</b> fuzzy set, multi-dimensional poverty, composite deprivation or poverty index...|$|R
40|$|Before the {{colonization}} there were various kingdoms {{in the region}} we now call Ghana. These kingdoms, addressed by the British as chiefdoms, were governed using the traditional chieftaincy system. Because of <b>the</b> democratization after <b>Ghana</b> <b>s</b> independence in 1957, these kingdoms became subjected to the new nation state and her constitution. From then on, the various kingdoms and the chieftaincy system gradually changed. This thesis focuses on chieftaincy in contemporary <b>Ghana</b> by explaining <b>the</b> current role and meaning of the chieftaincy system {{in the lives of}} the political officials and the inhabitants of the chiefdom Kukurantumi, a town in the Eastern region of Ghana. This thesis also gives insight in to which extent chieftaincy became subjected to the nation state and how these two domains work together. For this study qualitative research was done to answer the following research question What is the role and meaning of a chiefdom as a neo-traditional governance system in the life of the inhabitants and of the neo-traditional political actors in Kukurantumi, Eastern Region, Ghana? However, this study only grasped a moment out of the lives of the people in Kukurantumi. Only time will tell how chieftaincy in Kukurantumi will evolve in the future. ...|$|R
40|$|During <b>the</b> 2000 <b>s,</b> <b>Ghana</b> {{introduced}} substantial {{social protection}} policy reforms. The contributory pensions system was reformed {{from a single}} statutory defined-benefit scheme and a colonial-era unfunded scheme for civil servants to a new system with additional mandatory and voluntary privately-administered ‘tiers’ augmenting the statutory scheme. A new contributory national health insurance scheme was introduced in 2003. Several forms of social assistance targeted at the (largely rural) poor, including a school feeding programme, ‘capitation grants’ to expand free primary education and the flagship Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) cash transfer scheme were introduced. All of these reforms were initiated under John Kufuor (of the New Patriotic Party, NPP), who had defeated Jerry Rawlings (and his National Democratic Convention, NDC) in 2000. When the NDC returned to power in 2008, it continued the implementation of NPP-initiated reforms, modestly expanded cash transfers and maintained broadly similar economic and social policy...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ghana</b> <b>s</b> {{attainment}} of political independence from British rule on 6 th March, 1957, has experienced four successful military coups d état and numerous attempted coups. All these events occasioned extensive {{human rights violations}} and abuses. The military regimes (and occasionally civilian regimes) provided a platform for heinous and sustained violations of the fundamental human rights and freedoms of many citizens and foreigners resident in <b>Ghana.</b> <b>The</b> security agencies, especially, {{the police and the}} military were mainly responsible for these violations. However, most of these violations and abuses of human rights had not been investigated, officially acknowledged and redressed. As a result, considerable pain, anguish, bitterness and divisions existed in the Ghanaian society. At the heart of this thesis are two fundamental questions: (1) How do we effectively seek and promote national reconciliation, devoid of trials, in a country like Ghana whose past is characterized by politically motivated violent denial of constitutional rule, resulting in gross human rights abuses and violations? (2) What can be done to avoid a relapse into any and all of its retrogressive past? This study argues that, given the troubled past in <b>Ghana</b> <b>s</b> history, <b>the</b> National Reconciliation Commission (NRC) was essentially imperative even after a long democratic dispensation, during which period it all seems over and forgotten but not forgiven. The NRC has played a pivotal role by laying the foundation necessary for reconciling the nation. It also provides a holistic way of re-instituting {{the rule of law and}} reforming institutions to prevent any future relapse into rights violations and abuses. Although imperfect and subject to criticisms, the work of the Ghanaian NRC broaches an important stage in <b>Ghana</b> <b>s</b> process of attempting to understand its past and to make possible reconciliation for the purposes of healing wounds, consolidating its democracy and paving the way for socio-economic development...|$|R

40|$|Could it be a fairy tale? Pineapples {{that are}} good for everybody, farmers, traders and {{consumers}} alike? Perhaps not. In 1999, around 170 Ghanaian pineapple growers organised themselves with the prime objective of getting a better price for their pineapples. With support from the World Bank, the farmers established a consortium called Farmapine, which consists of five producers' associations, who own 80 % of Farmapine, and two exporting companies, who own the remaining 20 % of the shares. Farmapine provides its shareholders with credit, inputs and advice on cultivation, hygiene and market information. An extra advantage for the farmers is not only higher prices, but prompt payment, two weeks after delivery to Farmapine. This is much more reliable than when they delivered to individual traders and payments were made much later or even not at all. Farmapine also operates a warehouse, for packing and shipping. The two participating trading companies were chosen for their experience in exporting to <b>the</b> European Union (<b>Ghana</b> <b>s</b> major market) {{and their ability to}} comply with a jungle of regulations concerning uses of chemicals, labour standards, freshness, hygiene, storage and transport. From a modest 9, 000 t in 1992, exports to Europe in 2000 exceeded 35, 000 t of pineapples. Of this, more than 12 % (or 4, 000 t) was exported by Farmapine.
