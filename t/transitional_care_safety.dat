Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityPurpose: To {{identify}} {{barriers to}} and solutions for improving medication safety and reducing medical liability during patients’ transition from hospital to home. Methods: A qualitative descriptive study, {{guided by the}} Sensemaking Conceptual Framework, was completed with 10 focus groups of stakeholders that were segregated according to whether they represented patients/family members or a professional group. During each focus group, two case studies about patients experiencing medication discrepancies following a hospital to home transition were presented. Participants {{were asked to identify}} factors contributing to medication discrepancies, health system solutions to prevent medication discrepancies, and how assignment of responsibility should be accomplished if patients were permanently harmed because of a medication discrepancy. Results: Stakeholder groups identified common barriers and solutions to hospital-home <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> medication <b>safety.</b> Barriers to medication safety included themes related to patient/family-level factors (competency, retaining old prescriptions, and access to medication) as well as health system-level factors (communication and care coordination, complex discharge processes, staffing and time constraints). Solution themes were: improving information management, increasing access to medicines, and enhancing human resources. Participants across focus groups also reported that attributing responsibility for medication discrepancies was contextual and would require more detailed knowledge than was provided in the case studies. Conclusions: A wide range of stakeholders identified similar themes regarding barriers contributing to medication discrepancies during care transitions and solutions for reducing or overcoming barriers. Approaches to address many of the identified barriers are available. Study findings support more widespread adoption of evidence-based strategies and legislative provisions to improve <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> medication <b>safety</b> and to reduce medical liability...|$|R
40|$|First paragraph: In June 2000 the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) {{launched}} a {{revised drug strategy}} aimed at, among other things, effectively managing the transition between prison and the community. <b>Transitional</b> <b>Care</b> was introduced by SPS in 2001 to support short-term prisoners (that is, those serving less than 4 years) and remand prisoners with an identified substance misuse problem. The main aim of <b>Transitional</b> <b>Care</b> was to facilitate access to pre-existing community services based on an individual's assessed needs. This was done through the provision of support during a 12 -week period immediately following a prisoner's return to the community. The <b>Transitional</b> <b>Care</b> arrangements were provided by Cranstoun Drug Services under contract to SPS. A research team from the University of Stirling and TNS Social Research was commissioned to evaluate the operation and effectiveness of the <b>Transitional</b> <b>Care</b> initiative. A combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods was employed in this study. This included the analysis of <b>Transitional</b> <b>Care</b> monitoring data; surveys of prisoners four and seven months following release; in-depth interviews with ex-prisoners in three {{areas of the country}} with different demographic characteristics and varying arrangements for the delivery of Transitional Care; and interviews with prison and community based staff associated with <b>Transitional</b> <b>Care.</b> Interviews with prisoners included both those who had attended <b>Transitional</b> <b>Care</b> on release from prison and those who had not...|$|R

To date, few publications examine the experience of <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> for non-medically complex older adults. In this article, we draw on and thematically analyze interview and audio-diary data collected at three hospitals in Eastern England, and we explore the experience of <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> of 18 older adults and family caregivers. Participants reported mixed experiences when describing their care transitions, which indicated variations in care quality. To achieve independence and overcome the difficulties with care transitions, participants used a range of interrogative techniques, such as questioning and information seeking.

40|$|Background: Each year, 2 million older Americans {{complete}} {{three to}} four week courses of post-acute care in nursing homes and return home; however, scant research describes services to protect older adults during their transitions from nursing homes to home. In hospital-based studies, <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> interventions were associated with improved health outcomes for older adults, but these interventions added new staff positions, which are likely cost-prohibitive in nursing homes. Further, no prior study explored <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> provided for vulnerable, post-acute care patients in nursing homes. Thus, this dissertation was designed to develop new understandings about <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> provided by existing staff members in nursing homes. The study has two specific aims: (a) describe <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> and outcomes for older adults who obtain post-acute care in nursing homes from the day of admission through discharge; (b) {{explore the influence of}} interactions, among selected older adult patients and their group of nursing home caregivers, on their ability to accomplish <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> processes. Method: Using data from a literature review and theoretical models, including Donabedian's Model of Healthcare Quality and Anderson's Local Interaction Model, a conceptual model of <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> for post-acute care patients in nursing homes was constructed. The conceptual model was then used to guide exploration of the research aims with a longitudinal, multiple case study of <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> in a nursing home. The unit of analysis was the patient care-team, defined as individual post-acute care patients, family caregivers, and 6 to 8 professional staff in each team (e. g., rehabilitation therapists, physicians, nurses and social workers). Three patient care-team members were purposively sampled for study. Moreover, longitudinal data were collected using repeated interviews and observations with patients, family caregivers, and staff; document and daily chart reviews; and surveys of patient preparedness for discharge. Manifest content analysis and thematic analysis (qualitative methods) were used to conduct within- and across-case analyses of trajectories of <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> and to identify strengths, gaps and inconsistencies in care. Results: Findings related to the first research aim include a description of <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> in the study nursing home. Serious gaps and inconsistencies in <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> exposed older, post-acute care patients to risks for complications in their transitions from the study nursing home to home: (a) systemic supports were not available to support nursing home staff who provided transitional care; further, nursing home staff and leadership were unaware that they provided <b>transitional</b> care; (b) <b>care</b> processes were not in place to prepare older adults and their caregivers to continue care at home; (c) care-team interactions often excluded family members; and (d) post-acute care patients left the nursing home without resources needed to support safe transitions in <b>care,</b> including <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> plans, education to appropriately respond to acute changes in health, written materials to guide care at home, referrals for medical follow-up after discharge, and transfers of clinical information to primary care physicians. Findings related to the second research aim include a description of local interaction strategies and the effectiveness of <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> processes. When professional staff more consistently used local interaction strategies, specified in the model, care-team members exhibited greater capacity for connections, information exchange, and cognitive diversity. Further, when care-team interactions were of high quality and sufficient frequency, there were multiple indications of more effective <b>transitional</b> <b>care,</b> such as patient engagement in care, inclusion of patient priorities in care plans, and problem solving which included family members and diverse members of the patient care-team. Thus, local interaction strategies were essential staff behaviors needed to adapt care processes to the specific <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> needs of individual patients. Because <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> is a grossly under-developed care process in nursing homes, these findings will likely have immediate implications for practice and research. Findings will provide nursing home administrators and staff with resources to develop and evaluate care in nursing homes; further, the findings will help to create targets for protocol and care process development to strengthen existing practice and address deficiencies. Findings will provide researchers with resources for studying <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> in diverse samples of nursing homes, which should facilitate development of testable hypotheses for needed intervention studies. In addition, the local interaction strategies findings in the study may generalize to other settings of care, where interdependent staff work is required to establish connections, information networks, and to coordinate care among multiple staff members.

40|$|Purpose: <b>Transitional</b> <b>care</b> is an {{emerging}} model {{of health care}} designed to decrease preventable adverse events and associated utilization of healthcare through temporary follow-up after hospital discharge. This study describes the approach and outcomes of two <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> programs: one is provided by masters-prepared clinical nurse specialists (CNS) with a chronic disease self-management focus, another by physicians specializing in palliative care (PPC). Existing {{research has shown that}} <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> programs with intensive follow up reduce hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and costs. Few studies, however, have included side-by-side comparisons of the efficacy of <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> programs varying by health care providers or program focus. Design: This is a retrospective cohort study comparing the number of Emergency Department (ED) visits and hospitalizations in the 120 days before and after the intervention for patients enrolled in each <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> program.

40|$|BACKGROUND Although one out {{of every}} five {{gastrointestinal}} cancer patients needs <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> (home-based skilled care or placement in skilled nursing or rehabilitation facilities) following treatment, few studies have examined outcomes in this population compared to patients who return home without assistance. This study has two primary goals: 1. To evaluate long-term cancer-specific outcomes in colorectal cancer patients utilizing <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> compared to those that return home without assistance following therapy 2. To compare results using standard regression techniques and propensity scores. ^ METHODS Patients undergoing curative surgery for colorectal adenocarcinoma will be identified using data from a tertiary care Veterans Administration hospital. Survival and recurrence will then be determined from VA records and the Social Security Death Index. ^ The association between <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> utilization and overall and disease-free survival will be evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression to adjust for confounding factors. Predictors of <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> utilization will be assessed using multiple logistic regression to generate a propensity score which will also be used to assess differences in survival based on <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> use. ^ POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE If <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> utilization is associated with worse survival and recurrence following therapy then it will be important to subsequently assess the mechanism in order to target interventions to improve outcomes. If there is no difference in cancer-specific outcomes, then this project can potentially highlight benefits of supportive therapy following colorectal cancer resection. ...|$|R
50|$|A recent {{position}} {{statement from}} the American Geriatrics Society defines <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> as follows: For {{the purpose of this}} position statement, <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> is defined as a set of actions designed to ensure the coordination and continuity of health care as patients transfer between different locations or different levels of care within the same location. Representative locations include (but are not limited to) hospitals, sub-acute and post-acute nursing homes, the patient’s home, primary and specialty care offices, and long-term <b>care</b> facilities. <b>Transitional</b> <b>care</b> is based on a comprehensive plan of care and the availability of health care practitioners who are well-trained in chronic care and have current information about the patient’s goals, preferences, and clinical status. It includes logistical arrangements, education of the patient and family, and coordination among the health professionals involved in the transition. <b>Transitional</b> <b>care,</b> which encompasses both the sending and the receiving aspects of the transfer, is essential for persons with complex care needs.|$|R
40|$|<b>Transitional</b> <b>care</b> is an {{organized}} {{effort to provide}} pediatric patients with the tools and resources they need to assume personal responsibility for their medical care while facilitating their transfer from a pediatrician to an adult practitioner. Since inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is usually chronic and up to 25 % of IBD patients are diagnosed {{before the age of}} 18 years, <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> is an important consideration for adolescent and young adult patients. The importance of <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> for chronic diseases that begin in childhood has been recognized in a number of published recommendations. However, most of these recommendations arise from intuitive reasoning, as physicians lack information regarding the need for <b>transitional</b> <b>care,</b> optimal delivery protocols, and the efficacy of transition programs. Even fewer studies have been published regarding <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> in IBD. Current guidelines stress the importance of providing patients with educational resources to help them develop the skills they need to manage their care as independent adults, introducing the concept of transfer to adult care in advance of the actual transfer, and developing routes of communication to facilitate the transfer from pediatric to adult care providers.

Billions of dollars in hospital payments were made from Medicare towards readmissions. The problem of patients’ ineffective transitions during hospital discharge leads to an increased readmission rate. The purpose of the pilot {{study was to examine}} the effectiveness of the <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> interventions during post hospitalization in reducing 30 -day readmission rate in cardiac transplant patients. The quasi-experimental study used a retrospective group (baseline, usual discharge care) and a prospective group who received the <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> interventions. The study was implemented in an outpatient medical center in New York City. The convenience consecutive sampling size was 43 participants. The <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> interventions consisted of four components conducted by the advanced practice registered nurse: (1) meeting with the participants at the hospital, (2) facsimiles of discharge summaries, (3) scheduling a follow-up appointments, and (4) telephone call follow-up for 30 days post hospital discharge. The intervention group had a 30 -day readmission rate of 8. 3 % (2 / 24) compared to 36. 8 % (7 / 19) in the usual group. The results indicated a significant decrease in the 30 -day readmission rate among cardiac transplant patients who received the <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> interventions (p= 0. 03). In the intervention group, <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> provided the cardiac transplant patients with smooth, safe, and efficient transitions from hospital to home which can reduce the 30 -day readmission rate.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to investigate whether hospital-based <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> can reduce the postoperative complication in patients who received enterostomy or not by pooling the published prospective clinical studies. Materials and Methods: Prospective clinical studies related to hospital-based <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> for reducing the postoperative complication in patients with enterostomy were searched in the electronic databases of PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, CNKI, and Wanfang. The postoperative complications in the experiment and control groups were extracted from the original studies and pooled by fixed effects model. The publication bias was evaluated by Begg's funnel plot and Egger's line regression test. Results: After searching through the electronic databases of PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, CNKI, and Wanfang, we finally included in eight studies with 600 cases related to hospital-based <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> and postoperative complication in patients with enterostomy. The pooled result showed that hospital-based <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> could significantly reduce the postoperative complication in patients with enterostomy (risk ratio = 0. 42, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 0. 32, ~ 0. 55, P = 0. 005) by fixed effects model. The Begg's funnel plot demonstrated a litter left-right asymmetry, which indicated potential publication bias.

40|$|Abstract Background Readmissions are {{costly and}} have {{implications}} for quality of care. Studies {{have been reported to}} support effects of <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> programs in reducing hospital readmissions and enhancing clinical outcomes. However, there is a paucity of studies executing full economic evaluation to assess the cost-effectiveness of these <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> programs. This study is therefore launched to fill this knowledge gap. Methods Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial that examined the effects of a Health-Social <b>Transitional</b> <b>Care</b> Management Program (HSTCMP) for medical patients discharged from an acute regional hospital in Hong Kong. The cost and health outcomes were compared between the patients receiving the HSTCMP and usual care. The total costs comprised the pre-program, program, and healthcare utilization costs. Quality of life was measured with SF- 36 and transformed to utility values between 0 and 1. Results The readmission rates within 28 (control 10. 2 %, study 4. 0 %) and 84 days (control 19. 4 %, study 8. 1 %) were significantly higher in the control group. Utility values showed no difference between the control and study groups at baseline (p[*]=[*] 0. 308).

40|$|Background: Educating and {{training}} healthcare professionals {{is known to}} improve the quality of <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> for older adults. Arranging interprofessional meetings for healthcare professionals might be useful to improve patient participation skills in <b>transitional</b> <b>care.</b> Aim: To describe the learning activities used in The Meeting Point programme, focusing on patient participation in <b>transitional</b> <b>care,</b> and assess whether they increase healthcare professionals’ awareness of and competencies relating to patient participation in the <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> of older patients. Design: Data were collected as part of an educational intervention programme, The Meeting Point, including three seminars on ‘Patient participation in the <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> of older patients’ and four follow-up meetings. Participants were nurses, care assistants, doctors, physiotherapists, patient coordinators and administrative personnel from hospital, nursing homes and home-based care services. Method: The Meeting Point was organised around four pillars: introduction, teaching session, group work activity and plenary discussion. Qualitative data included log reports, summaries of meetings, notes from group work activities, and reports from participants and from follow-up meetings. Results: Feedback from participants shows that they were satisfied with meeting healthcare professionals from other units of care. A film scenario was perceived relevant for group work activity and useful in focusing participants’ attention to patient participation. Follow-up meetings show that some nursing home wards, the emergency department and one medical ward at the hospital continued with ongoing work to improve quality of care. Efforts included implementation of an observational waiting room with comfortable chairs, planning for discharge in hospital admission, a daily patient flow registration system and motivational interviewing during admission to nursing home.

This study sought to identify successful models of <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> for young people with CHNs. Three conditions were used as exemplars: cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorders and diabetes. Methods Scoping review: using search terms concerning <b>transitional</b> <b>care,</b> four databases were systematically searched for papers published in English between 1980 and April 2010. Additional informal search methods included recommendations from colleagues working with young people with each of the three conditions and making contact with clinical and research teams with expertise in <b>transitional</b> <b>care.</b> Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to define the papers selected for review. A separate review of policy documents, adolescent health and transition literature was also undertaken; 10 common summary categories for the components of high-quality services were identified. All papers were coded using a framework analysis which evaluated the data in two ways using the 10 transition categories and four elements of Normalization Process Theory that are important for successful implementation and integration of healthcare interventions. Results Nineteen papers were selected for review. A very limited literature of models of service provision was identified for young people with cerebral palsy and diabetes. No models were identified for young people with autism spectrum disorders. Furthermore most publications were either descriptions of new service provision or time-limited pilot studies with little service evaluation or consideration of key elements of effective implementation. Conclusions Despite agreement about the importance of effective <b>transitional</b> <b>care,</b> there is a paucity of evidence to inform best practice about both the process of and what constitutes effective <b>transitional</b> <b>care.</b> There is therefore an urgent need for research to evaluate current <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> practices for young people with CHNs.

40|$|Background: Heart failure (HF) is a complex, {{costly and}} {{debilitating}} chronic health condition. Symptom recognition and self-care are crucial components {{of heart failure}} management; however, many HF patients struggle to perform these behaviors and skills at a proficient level. A <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> program in the Southwest provides services to heart failure patients. A primary program aim is to help facilitate enhanced symptom recognition and self-care among heart failure patients. This project focuses on {{the assessment of the}} impact of such a <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> program on HF patients' ability to perform symptom recognition and self-care. Methods: Demographic questionnaires were distributed to collect socioeconomic data and clinical characteristics of participants. A pre and post SCHFI survey was completed by participants, and analysis of data performed using a paired t-test. Results: The 15 participants were primarily Hispanic, elderly, and male. The majority of participants reported an annual income less than $ 10, 000, lived in close proximity to the <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> clinic, reported living with family and/or friends, and had at least one additional comorbidity. There was improvement in self-care maintenance scores following the initial <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> encounter; however, participants did not achieve self-care adequacy in this domain. Participants also did not achieve self-care adequacy in self-management. Self-confidence scores improved to reach adequacy following the initial <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> encounter; however, results were not statistically significant. Conclusion: With the complexities of HF self-management, it is not alarming that these patients have continued to struggle with symptom recognition and self-care.

This longitudinal study included adolescents with type I diabetes, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and neuromuscular disorders (NMD). At baseline 138 respondents (response rate 31  %) filled in a questionnaire and 188 about 1  year later (response rate 43  %). Analysis of variance showed that adolescents with diabetes reported the highest physical quality of life, followed in order by those with NMD and JIA (p ≤ 0. 01). Adolescents with diabetes reported the highest social quality of life, followed in order by those with JIA and NMD (both at p ≤ 0. 001). Univariate analyses showed that satisfaction with <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> at T 0 was significantly related to emotional and physical quality of life at T 1 (both at p ≤ 0. 05). At T 1, satisfaction with <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> was significantly related to the emotional, physical, and social domains of quality of life (all at p ≤ 0. 001). Multiple regression analyses revealed that satisfaction with <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> at T 1 was related to emotional (β - 0. 20; p ≤ 0. 05) and social (β - 0. 35; p ≤ 0. 01) quality of life domains over time. This indicates that lower gap scores, which measured differences between 'best care' and 'current care,' are associated with better social and emotional quality of life in this sample of adolescents.

40|$|Background: Hospitals are {{frequently}} faced {{with high levels}} of emergency department presentations and demand for inpatient care. An important contributing factor is the subset of patients with complex chronic diseases who have frequent and preventable exacerbations of their chronic diseases. Evidence suggests that some of these hospital readmissions can be prevented with appropriate <b>transitional</b> <b>care.</b> Whilst there is a growing body of evidence for <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> processes in urban, non-indigenous settings, there is a paucity of information regarding rural and remote settings and, specifically, the indigenous context. Methods: This randomised control trial compares a tailored, multidimensional <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> package to usual care. The objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> package for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian patients with chronic diseases at risk of recurrent readmission with the aim of reducing readmission rates and improving transition to primary care in a remote setting. Patients will be recruited from medical and surgical admissions to Alice Springs Hospital and will be followed for 12 months. The primary outcome measure will be number of admissions to hospital with secondary outcomes including number of emergency department presentations, number of ICU admissions, days alive and out of hospital, time to primary care review post discharge and cost-effectiveness. Discussion: Successful transition from hospital to home is important for patients with complex chronic diseases. Evidence suggests that a coordinated <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> plan can result in a reduction in length of hospital stay and readmission rates for adults with complex medical needs. This will be the first study to evaluate a tailored multidimensional <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> intervention to prevent readmission in Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian residents of remote Australia who {{are frequently}} admitted to hospital. If demonstrated to be effective it will have implications for the care and management of Indigenous Australians throughout regional and remote Australia and in other remote, culturally and linguistically diverse populations and settings.

40|$|Introduction: Care {{transitions}} are {{a common}} and frequently adverse aspect of health care, resulting in a high-risk period for both care quality and patient safety. Patients who have complex care needs and undergo treatment in multiple care settings, such as older patients with musculoskeletal disorders, may be at higher risk for poor care transitions. Methods: Key informant interviews were used to gather in-depth information on <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> issues, particularly those which impact informational continuity, {{from the perspective of}} a range of health professionals (η= 17) in care settings relevant to the care continuum of older patients with hip fractures. Results: Three <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> themes were identified; medical complexity impacts care trajectories, larger circles of care can be both beneficial and challenging, and a variety of channels and modes are required for meaningful information exchange. Many issues cut across each care setting, and address challenges to informational continuity among and between health care providers, patients, and caregivers. Conclusions: Medical complexity enlarges the circle of care which challenges care continuity. There may be fundamental elements which, regardless of <b>care</b> setting, strengthen <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> quality. Standardized <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> processes might help to offset informational discontinuity across care settings as a result of this population's larger circles of care...|$|R

40|$|Ineffective <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> {{programs}} for ensuring {{the continuation of}} care from the hospital setting to the home setting often result in rehospitalization for elderly heart failure patients age 65 and older. The purpose of this project {{was to develop a}} home health <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> program for elderly patients transitioning from inpatient settings to home settings using care bundles consisting of evidence-based practices to reduce preventable rehospitalizations within 30 days of discharge. The home-based chronic care model, which provides a foundation for home health 2 ̆ 7 s integral role in chronic disease management by ensuring patient-centered evidence-based care, guided the development of this program. The developmental process elicited feedback from a team of home health advisory members, 3 home health experts, and 2 health care consumers who may use this program in the future. The readability of the program was at a 5 th grade level for easy comprehension. A 3 -item survey was given to 2 members from the target population, and a 5 -item survey was given to 3 content experts to evaluate the transitional program. The advisory members were asked to read and provide feedback on the <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> program. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics to obtain a content validity ratio score of 1. 00. Findings suggested universal agreement on the content of the <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> program, which was developed as a resource tool to provide evidence-based care bundle interventions from scholarly literature.

40|$|<b>Transitional</b> <b>care</b> {{has been}} defined as a set of actions {{designed}} to ensure the coordination and continuity of health care as patients transfer between different locations or different levels of care in the same location. <b>Transitional</b> <b>care,</b> which primarily concerns the relatively brief time interval that begins with preparing a patient to leave one setting and concludes when the patient is received in the next setting, poses challenges that distinguish it from other types of care. Many transitions are unplanned, result from unan-ticipated medical problems, occur in “real time ” during nights and on weekends, involve clinicians who may not have an ongoing relationship with the patient, and happen so quickly that formal and informal support mechanisms cannot respond in a timely manner.

40|$|To develop {{standards}} {{and recommendations for}} <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> for young people (YP) with juvenile-onset rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (jRMD). The consensus process involved the following: (1) establishing an international expert panel to include patients and representatives from multidisciplinary teams in adult and paediatric rheumatology; (2) a systematic review of published models of <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> in jRMDs, potential {{standards and}} recommendations, strategies for implementation and tools to evaluate services and outcomes; (3) setting the framework, developing the process map and generating a first draft of standards and recommendations; (4) further iteration of recommendations; (5) establishing consensus recommendations with Delphi methodology and (6) establishing standards and quality indicators. The final consensus derived 12 specific recommendations for YP with jRMD focused on <b>transitional</b> <b>care.</b> These included: high-quality, multidisciplinary care starting in early adolescence; the integral role of a transition co-ordinator; transition policies and protocols; efficient communications; transfer documentation; an open electronic-based platform to access resources; appropriate training for paediatric and adult healthcare teams; secure funding to continue treatments and services into adult rheumatology {{and the need for}} increased evidence to inform best practice.

40|$|Abstract Over 5 million Americans {{have been}} {{diagnosed}} with heart failure, and that number is growing. This disease is burdensome to the patient as it lessens their quality of life and to the healthcare system due to costliness and frequent readmissions. This study aims to evaluate if a student nurse led <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> program can increase patient self-care confidence, in turn reducing 30 day hospital readmission rates. Twenty patients completed the Self Care of Heart Failure Index before and after a 14 -week <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> program. These reported data were compared using a paired samples t-test. There was not a statistically significant difference in pre- and post- self-care maintenance with a mean difference of 3. 51 (95 % CI, - 5. 89 to 12. 91), t (17) =. 788, p=. 44, nor was there a statistically significant difference in self-care confidence with a mean difference of 8. 34 (95 % CI, - 1. 71 to 18. 39), t (17) = 1. 751, p= 0. 98. Only 5 participants were included in measuring self-care management, with a mean difference of 18 (95 % CI, - 58. 85 to 22), t (5) = - 1. 223, p=. 29. The implementation of a <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> program did not increase reported self-care maintenance, management, or confidence. <b>Transitional</b> <b>care</b> is complex and is most effective when provided at home with trained professionals for an extended amount of time. Despite the absence of a large increase in self-care, 30 -day hospital readmissions occurred among the study group at a rate of 4. 7 %, compared to the 25 % rate commonly found in the literature. <b>Transitional</b> <b>care</b> models have the capacity to improve patient care and health outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Background: Readmissions are {{costly and}} have {{implications}} for quality of care. Studies {{have been reported to}} support effects of <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> programs in reducing hospital readmissions and enhancing clinical outcomes. However, there is a paucity of studies executing full economic evaluation to assess the cost-effectiveness of these <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> programs. This study is therefore launched to fill this knowledge gap. Methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial that examined the effects of a Health-Social <b>Transitional</b> <b>Care</b> Management Program (HSTCMP) for medical patients discharged from an acute regional hospital in Hong Kong. The cost and health outcomes were compared between the patients receiving the HSTCMP and usual care. The total costs comprised the pre-program, program, and healthcare utilization costs. Quality of life was measured with SF- 36 and transformed to utility values between 0 and 1. Results: The readmission rates within 28 (control 10. 2 %, study 4. 0 %) and 84 days (control 19. 4 %, study 8. 1 %) were significantly higher in the control group. Utility values showed no difference between the control and study groups at baseline (p[*]=[*] 0. 308). Utility values for the study group were significantly higher than in the control group at 28 (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and 84 days (p[*]=[*] 0. 002). The study group also had a significantly higher QALYs gain (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) over time at 28 and 84 days when compared with the control group. The intervention had an 89 % chance of being cost-effective at the threshold of £ 20000 /QALY. Conclusions: Previous studies on <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> focused mainly on clinical outcomes and not too many included cost as an outcome measure. Studies examining the cost-effectiveness of the post-discharge support services are scanty. This study is the first to examine the cost-effectiveness of a <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> program that used nurse-led services participated by volunteers. Results have shown that a health-social partnership <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> program is cost-effective in reducing healthcare costs and attaining QALY gains. Economic evaluation helps to inform funders and guide decisions for the effective use of competing healthcare resources. School of Nursin...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Young people's {{transition}} from {{child and adolescent}} (CAMHS) to adult mental health services (AMHS). OBJECTIVES: To systematically review evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} different models of CAMHS-AMHS <b>transitional</b> <b>care,</b> service user and staff perspectives, and facilitators of/barriers to effective CAMHS-AMHS transition. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search in May 2012 of Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, AMED, Health Business Elite, HMIC, Cochrane Database, Web of Science and ASSIA; ancestral searches; and consultation with experts in the field. STUDY SELECTION: Qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods primary research on the CAMHS-AMHS health-care transition of young people (aged 16 - 21 years) with mental health problems. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently completed a standardised data extraction form and critically evaluated identified documents using a validated appraisal tool for empirical studies with varied methodologies. RESULTS: A total of 19 studies of variable quality were identified. None were randomised or case-controlled trials. Studies incorporating service user/carer perspectives highlighted the need to tackle stigma and provide accessible, age-appropriate services. Parents/carers wanted more involvement with AMHS. <b>Transitional</b> <b>care</b> provision was considered patchy and often not prioritised within mental health services. There was no clear evidence of superior effectiveness of any particular model. CONCLUSIONS: High-quality evidence of <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> models is lacking. Data broadly support the development of programmes that address the broader <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> needs of 'emerging adults' and their mental health needs but further evaluation is necessary. Developing robust <b>transitional</b> mental health <b>care</b> will require the policy-practice gap to be addressed and development of accessible, acceptable, responsive, age-appropriate provision...|$|R
