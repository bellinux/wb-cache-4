40|$|A {{new type}} of shared object, called <b>timed</b> <b>register,</b> is {{proposed}} and used {{for the design of}} indulgent timing-based algorithms. A <b>timed</b> <b>register</b> generalizes the notion of an atomic register as follows: if a process invokes two consecutive operations on the same <b>timed</b> <b>register</b> which are a read followed by a write, then the write operation is executed only if it is invoked at most d time units after the read operation, where d is defined as part of the read operation. In this context, a timing-based algorithm is an algorithm whose correctness relies on the existence of a bound ∆ such that any pair of consecutive constrained read and write operations issued by the same process on the same <b>timed</b> <b>register</b> are separated by at most ∆ time units. An indulgent algorithm is an algorithm that always guarantees the safety properties, and ensures the liveness property as soon as the timing assumptions are satisfied. The usefulness of this {{new type of}} shared object is demonstrated by presenting simple and elegant indulgent timing-based algorithms that solve the mutual exclusion, ℓ-exclusion, adaptive renaming, test&set, and consensus problems. Interestingly, <b>timed</b> <b>registers</b> are universal objects in systems with process crashes and transient timing failures (i. e., they allow building any concurrent object with a sequential specification). The paper also suggests connections with schedulers and contention managers. Categories ands Subject Descriptor...|$|R

40|$|Infinite <b>time</b> <b>register</b> {{machines}} (ITRMs) are register machines which act {{on natural}} numbers {{and which are}} allowed to run for arbitrarily many ordinal steps. Successor steps are determined by standard register machine commands. At limit times a register content {{is defined as a}} lim inf of previous register contents, if that limit is finite; otherwise the register is reset to 0. (A previous weaker version of infinitary register machines, in [6], would halt without a result in case of such an overflow.)

30|$|In general, {{the problem}} {{statement}} starts from a {{directed acyclic graph}} (DAG), with nodes representing operations of a loop, and edges for the intra- or inter-iteration dependencies between them. Those are valued at instructions’ latencies. The wanted schedule must be functionally correct regarding data dependencies and hardware conflicts, minimizing both II and register usage, therefore reducing the execution <b>time.</b> <b>Register</b> pressure is a critical element to consider while searching for a schedule; a commonly used strategy is to minimize the lifetime of instruction’s inputs/outputs.|$|E

If a real is computable relative to large set of oracles such {{as a set of}} full measure or just of positive measure, a comeager set, or a nonmeager Borel set, is it already computable? We show that the answer is independent from ZFC for ordinal time machines (OTMs) with and without ordinal parameters and give a positive answer for most other machines.

We show that a real r is recognizable iff it is Σ_ 1 -definable over L_ω_ω^CK,r, that r∈ L_ω_ω^CK,r for every recognizable real r and that either all or no real generated over an index stage L_γ are recognizable...|$|E

However, {{due to the}} lack of existing hardware, studies were conducted by simulating code generated by experimental compilers. This paper presents the first comprehensive study of the use of predication to implement if-conversion on production hardware with a near-production compiler. To better understand trends in the measurements, we generated binaries at three increasing levels of if-conversion aggressiveness. For each level, we gathered data regarding the global runtime effects of if-conversion on overall execution <b>time,</b> <b>register</b> pressure, code size, and branch behavior.

40|$|Infinite <b>Time</b> <b>Register</b> Machines (ITRM's) are a {{well-established}} machine model for infinitary computations. Their computational strength relative to oracles is understood, see e. g. Koepke (2009), Koepke and Welch (2011) and Koepke and Miller (2008). We consider {{the notion of}} recognizability, which was first formulated for Infinite Time Turing Machines in Hamkins and Lewis (200) and applied to ITRM's in Carl et al. (2010). A real x is ITRM-recognizable iff there is an ITRM-program P such that P^y stops with output 1 iff y=x, and otherwise stops with output 0. In Carl et al. (2010), it is shown that the recognizable reals are not contained in the computable reals. Here, we investigate in detail how the ITRM-recognizable reals are distributed along the canonical well-ordering <_L of Gödel's constructible hierarchy L. In particular, we prove that the recognizable reals have gaps in <_L, {{that there is no}} universal ITRM in terms of recognizability and consider a relativized notion of recognizability.

40|$|A typical {{phenomenon}} for machine {{models of}} transfinite computations is {{the existence of}} so-called lost melodies, i. e. real numbers x such that the characteristic function of the set {x} is computable while x itself is not (a real having the first property is called recognizable). This was first observed by J. D. Hamkins and A. Lewis for infinite time Turing machine, then demonstrated by P. Koepke and the author for ITRMs. We prove that, for unresetting infinite <b>time</b> <b>register</b> machines introduced by P. Koepke, recognizability equals computability, i. e. the lost melody phenomenon does not occur. Then, we give an overview on our results on the behaviour of recognizable reals for ITRMs. We show {{that there are no}} lost melodies for ordinal Turing machines or ordinal register machines without parameters and that this is, under the assumption that 0 ^ exists, independent of ZFC. Then, we introduce the notions of resetting and unresetting α-register machines and give some information on the question for which of these machines there are lost melodies...|$|E
