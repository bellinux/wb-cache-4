Belle admits the man she is leaving is {{overcome}} by evil yet she loves him. The Evil Queen offers the solution: true love's kiss will break the curse.

She serves the Church by kidnapping children for {{research into the}} nature of Dust.

Her dæmon is a golden monkey with a cruel streak.|$|E
25|$|She {{is about}} the medium height, perhaps a little below it. Her {{forehead}} is an unusually fine one nose of a slightly Roman curve; eyes dark and piercing; mouth well-formed and remarkably pleasant in its expression. The portrait in Graham's Magazine {{is by no means}} a likeness, and, although the hair is represented as curled, (Miss Sedgwick at present wears a cap—at least, most usually,) gives her the air of being much older <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E

The Brewsters are an unhappy family and Laura is deeply uncomfortable observing the way {{husband and wife}} quarrel. In one particularly unsettling incident, she wakes in the night to see Mrs Brewster standing over her husband with a knife. It's a bitterly cold winter, and neither the claim shanty or the school house can be heated adequately. The children she is teaching, {{some of whom are}} older <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> herself, test her skills as a teacher. Laura grows more self-assured through the term, and successfully completes the two-month term.|$|E

500|$|Pfeiffer {{has long}} been {{referred}} to {{as one of the most}} beautiful actresses in Hollywood, a designation The Daily Telegraph Mick Brown considers to be both [...] "a defining characteristic in her acting career" [...] and [...] "a curse". Pfeiffer initially struggled to convince casting agents and directors to take her seriously as an actress because they perceived her as little more than a pretty face during the early stages of her career. Pfeiffer's acting abilities continued to be overshadowed by her beauty even several years after her breakout performance in Scarface (1983); she responded by pursuing roles in which being blond is not a requirement. The Daily Beast Elizabeth Kaye recognized Pfeiffer among Hollywood's rare [...] "beautiful women" [...] who trust that it is possible to be physically beautiful and serious simultaneously. Kaye believes that the actress achieves this feat by [...] "grafting the sensibility of a modern woman onto the glamour of a '30s icon"; Rolling Stones Gerri Hirshey agreed that Pfeiffer's roles combine [...] "Nineties guts and Thirties glamour." [...] For Interview magazine, Peter Stone described Pfeiffer as a [...] "Blond, sultry, and ethereal" [...] actress with an [...] "unforgettable" [...] face. Nisha Lilia Diu, another The Daily Telegraph contributor, opined, [...] "It's not that she looks younger <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> – she doesn't particularly – it's the symmetry of her bone structure, the flashing aquamarine eyes and those lips, the top one so much fuller than the bottom. It's the kind of beauty you find yourself involuntarily taking a moment to marvel at mid-conversation." [...] At least two of Pfeiffer's films, Stardust (2007) and Chéri (2009), in which she plays a 5, 000 year old witch obsessed with beauty and a courtesan fading into obscurity, respectively, explore themes of beautiful women struggling with the idea of aging. Pfeiffer personally identified with the topic of [...] "our obsession with youth and the ludicrous degrees to which women will go to reclaim it" [...] portrayed in the films. Pfeiffer claims to not want to appear younger <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> and has yet to undergo plastic surgery, although she admits she would [...] "never say never" [...] to the procedure. Dismissing the claim that she is [...] "drop dead gorgeous", insisting that she is only [...] "conventionally pretty". Pfeiffer has been famously self-deprecating about her own appearance, comparing herself to Howard the Duck.|$|E

500|$|Charles Aaron from Spin {{described}} the song as [...] "slinking through [...] low-ridin', gum-smackin' groove, Maddy's hard-bitten ingenue expresses no regrets, {{but this time}} you feel for her." [...] Aaron highlighted the lyrics [...] "Would it sound better if I were a man?" [...] as subversive and coy. Author Lucy O'Brien described in her book, , that [...] "Human Nature" [...] {{was one of the}} [...] "quirkiest" [...] tracks on Bedtime Stories, [...] "throbbing with a tightly restrained but devastating anger". For Barry Walters from Moscow-Pullman Daily News, the song had the catchiest chorus among all the other tracks from the album. Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly gave the song a negative review, noting that Madonna's [...] "on far surer ground thrashing through such neurotic (if not uncommon) views of relationships <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> trashing the media. In striking back at her critics, Madonna simply sounds self-righteous and smug. 'I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex,' she sneers in 'Human Nature'. 'Did I say something true?' Yes. But tooting your own horn about it just sounds petty". Rooksby said that the repetition of the sample was [...] "wearing" [...] and it [...] "did not suggest that the world of the singer was very appealing".|$|E
500|$|David's mother Gail McIntyre (Helen Worth) {{is shocked}} to learn the {{identity}} of his mystery fiancée, and disapproves of Kylie. The pair repeatedly clash in scenes that serve as comic relief. Gail dislikes Kylie because she [...] "knows her type", {{and the fact that}} she is related to Becky does not bode well. Lane said that Gail's reaction was understandable because Kylie is not the epitome of [...] "the perfect daughter-in-law." [...] She added that because Gail is so possessive of David, [...] "it doesn't bode well for the future." [...] Shepherd added that they are [...] "the match made in hell" [...] and revealed that David lets her do as she pleases because he is in love with her. He later said that David appeared obsessed and shared the similar dynamic he had with previous girlfriend Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan). He concluded: [...] "I think he's keener on her <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> on him." [...] David fools Kylie into believing he owns a salon. Lane explained [...] "Kylie sees an opportunity for a better life, but not in a money-grubbing, scheming way. She does love David, and she's not doing anything wrong." [...] Kylie sees the situation as an [...] "added bonus". After Kylie finds out the truth, the pair come up with a plan to [...] "wheedle" [...] his grandmother Audrey Roberts' (Sue Nicholls) salon off her.|$|E

Jakub has dreamed up an urban version of the stereotypical fantasy of a free-spirited Gypsy life with Jolana, whereas she has dreamed of a grounded life away from her troubled community and applies herself to achieve that. While Jakub goes from fantasy to prison to fantasy, Jolana gets a steady job and begins to realize that Jakub is no more her fantasy of a down-to-earth Gojo (non-Rom) <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> his [...] "Gypsy woman".|$|E

2500|$|The chapter {{also points}} out the fact that, despite being born to Muggle parents, Hermione's magical {{abilities}} are innate. Her [...] "compulsion for study" [...] helps both the character's development, which makes Hermione [...] "a prime example that information brings power", and {{the plot of the}} series, as her knowledge of the wizarding world is often used to [...] "save the day".

2500|$|In a mixed review, Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani {{expressed}} that Oh Land's [...] "cinematic arrangements bring Janelle Monáe's ambitious approach to pop music to mind, but tracks like 'Wolf & I' and 'Lean' draw {{a bit too}} heavily from the trip-hop playbook [...] and, however well-excecuted they may be, end up sounding derivative." [...] Similarly, Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music felt that [...] "there's {{a bit of an}} identity void {{at the heart of the}} thing, a lack of personality. It might just be that Oh Land is more skilled at getting songs to sound current <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> at expressing herself." [...] Drowned in Sounds John Calvert called the album [...] "hip, diverse and always vibrant", but also branded it [...] "pretty forgettable". Calvert pointed out the production work of Dave McCracken and Dan Carey, noting the album [...] "inhabits a tepid middle ground between the two extremes—offering neither gilded Scandi chart-pop (Robyn, Annie) or the artistic mettle of Scandi indie bands, most of whom are able to turn out sublime pop anyway." ...|$|E
2500|$|But its implied {{homosexuality}} {{resulted in}} the severance of several friendships with women who felt she had betrayed their sexuality. Garbo also ended their friendship at this time. Eva Le Gallienne in particular was furious, denouncing de Acosta as a liar and stating that she invented the stories for fame. This characterization is inaccurate since many of her affairs and relationships with women, including that with Le Gallienne, are confirmed in personal correspondence. An exception to this was Marlene Dietrich, who continued to correspond with her and loved the book. According to critic Patricia White, [...] "If she craved being seen, MdA was more careful about what she said <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> given credit for. She wrote a name-dropping memoir, but for something attacked for exaggeration, it barely alludes to homosexuality". In any case, she gained a reputation that was not appreciated by everyone. But as Alice B. Toklas, lover of Gertrude Stein and de Acosta's long-term friend, wrote to a disapproving critic, [...] "Say what you will about Mercedes, she's had the most important women of the twentieth century".|$|E
