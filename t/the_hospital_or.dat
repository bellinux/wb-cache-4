5|$|In late 1941, the Japanese {{entered the}} war, attacking Pearl Harbor and {{launching}} {{an invasion of}} Malaya. Faced with a threat closer to home, the Australian government pressed {{for the return of}} its troops from the Middle East, and so in early 1942 the 7th Division began withdrawing from their garrison posts in Syria and Lebanon. The 2/3rd left the village of Fih and moved to a camp at Hill 69, in Palestine, on 14 January 1942. They remained there until 31 January when they boarded a train which took them to Kantara where they were ferried across the canal to continue the journey to Port Tewfik where the majority of the battalion, totalling 636 personnel of all ranks, boarded the troopship Orcades. Men who were in <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>or</b> on course were subsequently reposted to the 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion, and remained in the Middle East, later seeing action at El Alamein. Others who did not board the Orcades included the battalion's 'B' Echelon, essentially all its vehicles, baggage and heavy weapons, and its maintenance personnel. These embarked on eight smaller vessels: the Silver Willow, Penrith Castle, Shillong, Tarifa, Sophecles, Nigerstroom, Industria and Tricolor. These ships were to follow the Orcades up at its eventual destination, which was at the time, still being kept secret even to the troops on board.|$|E

25|$|On February 7, 1981, the Beechcraft Bonanza A36TC Wozniak was {{piloting}} crashed {{soon after}} takeoff from the Sky Park Airport in Scotts Valley, California. The plane stalled while climbing, then bounced down the runway, went through two fences, {{and crashed into}} an embankment. Wozniak and his three passengers—then-fiancée Candice Clark, his brother, and his girlfriend—were injured. Wozniak sustained severe face and head injuries, including losing a tooth, and also suffered for five weeks after the crash from anterograde amnesia, the inability to create new memories. He had no memory of the crash, and did not remember his name in <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>or</b> {{the things he did}} after he was released. He would later state that Apple II computer games are what helped him regain his memory. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation report cited premature liftoff and pilot inexperience as probable causes of the crash.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of extreme climatic conditions, contacts with civilians, {{the density of}} the population in the barracks and poor organization led to the first outbreak of typhus in December 1915. In February 1916, a quarantine was enforced and sick prisoners were transferred either to <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>or</b> separate barracks. The epidemic was subdued in March with the help of two Swedish Red Cross sisters of mercy who had arrived two months earlier. In order to further isolate the healthy from the sick, healthy prisoners formed groups which were employed in the local agricultural sector. Productivity improved rapidly once the work became paid. The spectrum of employment opportunities gradually expanded to include the telegraph–post service, railroad maintenance, leather work, logging, photo ateliers, mills, construction work, production of building materials and soap. The influx of cheap labor greatly benefited the local economy. Over time the camp was visited by delegations from the Danish and Swedish Red Cross as well as the American embassy. The commander of the Zabaykalsk gendarmerie believed the Swedish Red Cross mission to be motivated by intelligence gathering rather than humanitarian concerns. Reports issued by the delegation attested to the upholding of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907.|$|E

25|$|When {{the patient}} visits a doctor, the latter spends {{time with the}} former {{discussing}} his medical problems, including history and/or problems. The doctor performs a physical examination and may request various laboratory or diagnostic studies; will make a diagnosis or differential diagnoses, then decides on a plan of treatment for the patient, which is discussed and explained to the patient, with instructions provided. After the patient leaves the office, the doctor uses a voice-recording device to record {{the information about the}} patient encounter. This information may be recorded into a hand-held cassette recorder or into a regular telephone, dialed into a central server located in <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>or</b> transcription service office, which will 'hold' the report for the transcriptionist. This report is then accessed by a medical transcriptionist, it is clearly received as a voice file or cassette recording, who then listens to the dictation and transcribes it into the required format for the medical record, and of which this medical record is considered a legal document. The next time the patient visits the doctor, the doctor will call for the medical record or the patient's entire chart, which will contain all reports from previous encounters. The doctor can on occasion refill the patient's medications after seeing only the medical record, although doctors prefer to not refill prescriptions without seeing the patient to establish if anything has changed.|$|E

The series is best remembered for its cancellation due to the Spanish flu pandemic. Several players from both teams became ill, prompting health officials in Seattle to cancel the sixth, and deciding, game. With his entire team either in <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>or</b> confined to bed, Kennedy attempted to borrow players from the PCHA's Victoria Aristocrats, only to be turned down by PCHA president Frank Patrick. [...] With no way to field a team, Kennedy announced he was forfeiting the game—and the Cup—to the Metropolitans. [...] However, the Metropolitans turned it down; coach Pete Muldoon felt that with the Canadiens decimated by the flu, it wouldn't be sportsmanlike to claim the title. Star defenceman Joe Hall never recovered, and died on April 5, 1919.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the tornado's path, 36 {{people were}} killed {{as a direct result}} of the storm and five more died of {{indirect}} causes in the hours following it (most of the indirect deaths were due to heart attacks or injuries suffered while trying to seek shelter; one survivor, who was uninsured, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound). According to the Oklahoma Department of Health, an estimated 583 people were injured by the tornado, accounting for those who likely did not go to <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>or</b> were unaccounted for. In terms of structural losses, a total of 8,132 homes, 1,041 apartments, 260 businesses, 11 public buildings, and seven churches were damaged or destroyed.

500|$|There is no {{certainty}} {{with regard}} to <b>the</b> <b>Hospital</b> <b>or</b> its location. The first reference to a hospital being built comes from the 1233 Charter by Alan the Durward. Confirmatory evidence {{can be found in}} 1296 in the Second Ragman Roll. On 28 August 1296 [...] " [...] …Wautier master of the hospital of Kincardine ou Neel …" [...] signed the Roll at Berwick on Tweed. Two possible sites have been identified. Most likely, it was founded by Alan or Thomas Durward between 1241 and 1244 abutting St Erchard's Church. It was later built near St Mary's Church – the [...] "Auld Kirk" [...] in Kincardine O'Neil. In 1330 the hospital and its church was erected into a prebend of Aberdeen Cathedral. It may have stood in a field known locally as [...] "Bladernach" [...] near a 19th-century ferryboat station on the river Dee at NO 5874 9933. There was no local knowledge of Bladernach in June 1972 when visited by the Ordnance Survey. The following description comes from Places of Worship in Scotland: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{consequences}} of the operation {{have been described as}} [...] "mixed". Some patients {{died as a result of}} the operation and others later committed suicide. Some were left severely brain-damaged. Others were able to leave <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> <b>or</b> became more manageable within the hospital. A few people managed to return to responsible work, while at the other extreme people were left with severe and disabling impairments. Most people fell into an intermediate group, left with some improvement of their symptoms but also with emotional and intellectual deficits to which they made a better or worse adjustment. On average, there was a mortality rate of approximately 5 percent during the 1940s.|$|E

2500|$|There is a {{great deal}} of {{variation}} in the training of EMS personnel in Italy like in many countries, where no distinction is made between volunteers and paid EMTs.

Italian EMTs are able to provide non-invasive prehospital care, including PBLS, PTLS and automated external defibillation. In few regions EMTs are also trained to assist nurses or physician with endotracheal intubation, to establish venous access, to aspirate drugs and to execute a 12 lead ECG, which will be transmitted to <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>or</b> to the 118-operations room, where a cardiologist can examine it before the arrival of the patient.|$|E
