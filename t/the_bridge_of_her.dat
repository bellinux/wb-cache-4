500|$|Rather than {{attempting}} {{to capture a}} realistic portrayal of the three, Utamaro idealizes their likenesses. [...] To many viewers, the faces in this and other portraits of the time seem little individuated, or perhaps not at all. Others emphasize the subtle differences that distinguish the three in {{the shapes of the}} mouths, noses, and eyes: [...] Kita has plump cheeks and an innocent expression; her eyes are almond-shaped, and <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> nose high; [...] Hisa has a stiffer, proud expression, and the bridge of Hisa's nose is lower and her eyes rounder than Kita's; [...] Toyohina's features fall in between, and she has an air of being older and more intellectual.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} notable {{in that it}} was the first episode of the series to confirm Agent Scully's cancer. Reportedly, when Chris Carter {{informed}} Gillian Anderson that her character would be diagnosed with cancer, she was [...] "delighted" [...] that {{she would be able to}} play her character in a different way. John Shiban considers the episode to be [...] "a great X-Files story" [...] and very important because it established the story-arc featuring Scully's cancer. However, the audience receives an early indication of Scully's cancer in the episode [...] "Unruhe" [...] (which aired earlier in the same season, also written by Vince Gilligan), when Gerry Schnauz kidnaps her in the episode and says he can see Scully's [...] "unrest", and points to <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> nose–exactly where her cancer would be.|$|E
500|$|Barbara {{is shown}} {{wearing a red}} dress and a matte white bonnet which fully covers her hair, {{indicating}} her marital status. Her headdress is draped with a long scarf or train which stretches down her neck and across her left shoulder, contrasting in colour and shape against the black head-wear of her husband. The lines of her face contain touches of white paint to give a highlighting and enlivening effect; they are especially evident around her eyes, <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> nose and around her upper lip. Barbara was attractive in her youth; her son described her as having been [...] "comely and of erect bearing". However, {{by the time of}} this portrait the effects of time and losing so many children weigh heavily on her face. The panel was grounded with white paint, while the composition seems to have changed significantly from the [...] imprimatura. Faint traces of the original figuration are visible in parts of the background and in the darkened areas of her hood. At some point the panel was cut down at the left side, shifting the compositional balance and removing a portion of her shoulder and headdress.|$|E

50|$|His wife, Kathryn (1887-1937), died on October 31, 1937 at Ossining Hospital {{after she}} fell at the Cortlandt, New York end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bear Mountain <b>Bridge.</b> <b>The</b> heel <b>of</b> <b>her</b> shoe was caught between two boards and it {{caused her to}} fall and break her leg.

50|$|The {{singer and}} actress Monica Zetterlund (1937-2005) {{mentions}} <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> in one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> major hits Sakta vi gå genom stan (Swedish cover on Walking My Baby Back Home) {{in the now}} famous lyrics written by Beppe Wolgers: På Västerbron, i den himmelska ron, en spårvagn går ensam och tom.

5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Don't Tell Me" [...] was {{directed}} by Liz Friedlander and filmed in Los Angeles, California in March 2004. The video {{tells the story of}} the song. It opens with Lavigne's boyfriend leaving her apartment. After taking her anger out on her bedroom, she follows him around the city. During <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song, <b>her</b> boyfriend sees her in many places at once, so it is obvious that he is feeling guilty and her feelings are weighing heavily on his mind. At the end of the video, she decides that he is better off without her and lets him walk away.|$|R
50|$|The {{official}} {{synopsis of}} the film {{was published in the}} The Moving Picture World. The film follows Elsie Plush, an avid a dime novel reader who becomes infatuated with the type of hero in Laura Jean Libbey's books. After reading A Great Hero, she rejects the marriage proposal of George Mild. She says that he a fine young man, but that he is not the hero she is looking for. Plush then encounter military man and idolizes him as her hero. As she walks with the man, she falls from <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> Instead <b>of</b> saving <b>her,</b> he calls for help and she is rescued by an athlete. Elsie's ideal is broken and latches onto the athlete as her hero.|$|R
50|$|They ran on, to a king's palace, or {{to a great}} farm. Their story {{impressed}} the king or farmer, but he said if she stole the giant's sword, {{from the back of}} his bed, he would marry his oldest son to her oldest sister. She went and hid under the bed. When the giant went to sleep, she stole it. It rattled when she went over the threshold, and the giant chased her, but she escaped over <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> one hair. <b>The</b> king married his oldest son to her oldest sister, and then told her if she stole the purse the giant kept under his pillow, he would marry his second son to her second sister. Once again she hid under the bed and stole it while he slept, but he woke and chased her, and she escaped over <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> one hair. <b>Her</b> second sister was married to the king's second son.|$|R
60|$|It {{soon became}} obvious to the missionary that a most {{unexpected}} and pleasant meeting of friends was taking place; but the surprise expressed on his grave visage had barely given place to a benignant smile of sympathy, when a female shriek was heard, and Sigokow was seen running towards her sister Kabelaw. These two did not leap into each other's arms. The feelings of Eskimo females do not usually find vent in that way; but they waltzed round each other, and grinned, and smoothed each other's hair, and when Kabelaw observed that {{her sister had}} a huge black eye and a yet unhealed cut across <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> rather flat nose, she clapped her hands, and went into fits of laughter, which helped her somewhat to relieve her feelings.|$|E
60|$|After which, appears Sophronia (whom Twemlow {{has seen}} twice in his lifetime), to thank Twemlow for {{counterfeiting}} the late Horatio Akershem Esquire, broadly of Yorkshire. And after her, appears Alfred (whom Twemlow has seen {{once in his}} lifetime), {{to do the same}} and to make a pasty sort of glitter, as if he were constructed for candle-light only, and had been let out into daylight by some grand mistake. And after that, comes Mrs Veneering, in a pervadingly aquiline state of figure, and with transparent little knobs on her temper, like the little transparent knob on <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> nose, 'Worn out by worry and excitement,' as she tells her dear Mr Twemlow, and reluctantly revived with curacoa by the Analytical. And after that, the bridesmaids begin to come by rail-road from various parts of the country, and to come like adorable recruits enlisted by a sergeant not present; for, on arriving at the Veneering depot, they are in a barrack of strangers.|$|E
60|$|This day he {{came upon}} {{a woman and her}} child farther down stream than usual. The former was searching for a species of {{shellfish}} which was {{to be found in the}} mud close to the river bank. She was a young black woman of about thirty. Her teeth were filed to sharp points, for her people ate the flesh of man. Her under lip was slit that it might support a rude pendant of copper which she had worn for so many years that the lip had been dragged downward to prodigious lengths, exposing the teeth and gums of her lower jaw. Her nose, too, was slit, and through the slit was a wooden skewer. Metal ornaments dangled from her ears, and upon her forehead and cheeks; upon her chin and <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> nose were tattooings in colors that were mellowed now by age. She was naked except for a girdle of grasses about her waist. Altogether she was very beautiful in her own estimation and even in the estimation of the men of Mbonga's tribe, though she was of another people--a trophy of war seized in her maidenhood by one of Mbonga's fighting men.|$|E
50|$|She got {{underway}} 22 January 1945 {{to escort}} an LST group on its slow trip across the Pacific {{for the landings}} on Iwo Jima 19 February. She continued her service in this operation with surveying and patrol duty. On 1 April she {{took part in the}} invasion of Okinawa. Remaining off the bitterly contested island, by day she conducted surveys to determine suitable landing beaches for amphibious craft; by night she guarded against suicide boats and swimmers. On 27 May a Japanese plane crashed the ship, carrying away part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> blowing one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> crew overboard, and holing her, fortunately above the water line. She underwent temporary repairs at Kerama Retto, then sailed to San Pedro Bay, Leyte, for permanent repairs.|$|R
5|$|In 1995, Streep starred {{opposite}} Clint Eastwood as an unhappily {{married woman}} in <b>The</b> <b>Bridges</b> <b>of</b> Madison County, <b>her</b> biggest critical and commercial {{success of the}} decade. Although <b>her</b> dramas <b>of</b> the late 1990s received a mixed reception overall, she was praised {{for her role as}} a cancer patient in One True Thing (1998). She had acclaimed roles in the 2002 films Adaptation and The Hours, and won a second Emmy Award for the television miniseries Angels in America a year later, though she failed to replicate her earlier success. This changed in 2006, with an Academy Award-nominated role as a ruthless fashion magazine editor in the comedy-drama The Devil Wears Prada. This late-period success led to starring roles in several high-profile films, including the US$609 million-grossing romantic comedy Mamma Mia! (2008), her highest-grossing release, and the comedy-drama Julie & Julia (2009), in which she played Julia Child. These roles re-established Streep's stardom in Hollywood. <b>Her</b> portrayal <b>of</b> Margaret Thatcher in the biopic The Iron Lady (2011) earned her another Academy Award for Best Actress. The starring role of Florence Foster Jenkins in the 2016 comedy-drama film of the same name garnered Streep her 20th Oscar nomination, more than any actor or actress in history.|$|R
2500|$|While Stein {{had earlier}} {{contacts}} with Roman Catholicism, it was <b>her</b> reading <b>of</b> {{the autobiography of}} the mystic St. Teresa of Ávila during summer holidays in Bad Bergzabern in 1921 that prompted her conversion. Baptized on 1 January 1922, and dissuaded by her spiritual advisers from immediately seeking entry to the religious life, she obtained a position to teach at the Dominican nuns' school in Speyer from 1923 to 1931. While there, she translated Thomas Aquinas' De Veritate (Of Truth) into German, familiarized herself with Roman Catholic philosophy in general, and tried to <b>bridge</b> <b>the</b> phenomenology <b>of</b> <b>her</b> former teacher, Husserl, to Thomism. She visited Husserl and Heidegger at Freiburg in April 1929, the same month that Heidegger gave a speech to Husserl on his 70th birthday. In 1932 she became a lecturer at the Catholic Church-affiliated Institute for Scientific Pedagogy in Münster, but antisemitic legislation passed by the Nazi government forced her to resign the post in 1933. In a letter to Pope Pius XI, she denounced the Nazi regime and asked the Pope to openly denounce the regime [...] "to {{put a stop to}} this abuse of Christ's name." ...|$|R
6000|$|Quite {{early in}} the {{business}} {{she had begun to}} knit, moving her slim fingers not too fast, gazing at the grey wool through glasses, specially rimless and invisible, perched on <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> firm, well-shaped nose, and now and then speaking to her parrot. The bird could say, [...] "Scratch a poll, Poll," [...] already, and [...] "Hullo!" [...] those keys to the English language. The maid Augustine, having completed some small duty, would often come and stand, her head on one side, gazing down with a sort of inquiring compassion in her wise, young, clear-brown eyes. It seemed to her who was straight and sturdy as a young tree both wonderful and sad that Madame should be seventy-seven, and so frail--Madame who had no lines in her face and such beautiful grey hair; who had so strong a will-power, too, and knitted such soft comforters [...] "pour nos braves chers poilus." [...] And suddenly she would say: [...] "Madame n'est pas fatiguée?" [...] And Madame would answer: [...] "No. Speak English, Augustine--Polly will pick up your French! Come here!" [...] And, reaching up a pale hand, she would set straight a stray fluff of the girl's dark-brown hair or improve the set of her fichu.|$|E

60|$|Some {{adequate}} cause {{must have}} originally introduced {{all the money}} coined at its mint into that kingdom; and some cause as operative must have kept at home, or returned into its bosom, such a vast flood of treasure as M. Necker calculates to remain for domestic circulation. Suppose any reasonable deductions from M. Necker's computation, the remainder must still amount to an immense sum. Causes thus powerful to acquire and to retain cannot be found in discouraged industry, insecure property, and a positively destructive government. Indeed, when I consider {{the face of the}} kingdom of France, the multitude and opulence <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cities, the useful magnificence <b>of</b> <b>her</b> spacious high-roads and <b>bridges,</b> <b>the</b> opportunity <b>of</b> <b>her</b> artificial canals and navigations opening the conveniences of maritime communication through a solid continent of so immense an extent,--when I turn my eyes to the stupendous works <b>of</b> <b>her</b> ports and harbors, and to her whole naval apparatus, whether for war or trade,--when I bring before my view the number <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fortifications, constructed with so bold and masterly a skill, and made and maintained at so prodigious a charge, presenting an armed front and impenetrable barrier to her enemies upon every side,--when I recollect how very small a part of that extensive region is without cultivation, and to what complete perfection the culture of many of the best productions of the earth have been brought in France,--when I reflect on the excellence <b>of</b> <b>her</b> manufactures and fabrics, second to none but ours, and in some particulars not second,--when I contemplate the grand foundations of charity, public and private,--when I survey the state of all the arts that beautify and polish life,--when I reckon the men she has bled for extending her fame in war, her able statesmen, the multitude <b>of</b> <b>her</b> profound lawyers and theologians, her philosophers, her critics, her historians and antiquaries, her poets and her orators, sacred and profane,--I behold in all this something which awes and commands the imagination, which checks the mind on the brink of precipitate and indiscriminate censure, and which demands that we should very seriously examine what and how great are the latent vices that could authorize us at once to level so spacious a fabric with the ground. I do not recognize in this view of things the despotism of Turkey. Nor do I discern the character of a government that has been on the whole so oppressive, or so corrupt, or so negligent, as to be utterly unfit for all reformation. I must think such a government well deserved to have its excellences heightened, its faults corrected, and its capacities improved into a British Constitution.|$|R
