25|$|However, due to {{a strong}} clan mentality, these aristocrats' loyalty to the King was weaker than desired, and this {{represented}} a threat. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> King established a new title, Årmann, which was given to persons of lower origin. These persons, who were the direct vassals of the King, {{were considered to be}} more loyal as they did not have the same family allegiance to aristocratic clans. An Årmann would act as a local observer and send reports to the King. This dual set of aristocrats was intended to secure the new monarchical system.|$|E
25|$|Oxidation and {{reduction}} affects {{the migration of}} arsenic in subsurface environments. Arsenite is the most stable soluble form of arsenic in reducing environments and arsenate, which is less mobile than arsenite, is dominant in oxidizing environments at neutral pH. Therefore, arsenic may be more mobile under reducing conditions. The reducing environment is also rich in organic matter which may enhance the solubility of arsenic compounds. As a result, the adsorption of arsenic is reduced and dissolved arsenic accumulates in groundwater. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> arsenic content is higher in reducing environments than in oxidizing environments.|$|E
25|$|Quadrature is a {{historical}} mathematical term that means calculating area. Quadrature problems have served {{as one of the}} main sources of mathematical analysis. Mathematicians of Ancient Greece, according to the Pythagorean doctrine, understood calculation of area as the process of constructing geometrically a square having the same area (squaring). <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> process was named quadrature. For example, a quadrature of the circle, Lune of Hippocrates, The Quadrature of the Parabola. This construction must be performed only by means of compass and straightedge.|$|E

25|$|These {{elements}} constituted only 0.6% of {{the material}} in the solar nebula. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> terrestrial planets could not grow very large and could not exert large pull on hydrogen and helium gas. Also, the faster collisions among particles close to the Sun were more destructive on average. Even if the terrestrial planets had had hydrogen and helium, the Sun would have heated the gases and caused them to escape. Hence, solar terrestrial planets such as Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are dense small worlds composed mostly from 2% of heavier elements contained in the solar nebula.|$|E
25|$|It is the {{disagreement}} amongst {{the advocates of}} different approaches to problems or solutions which hinders the formation of any consensual strategy and the mobilization of adequate resources. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Encyclopedia uses an approach that is as general and minimally structured as is feasible without losing coherence and utility. The intent is first to contribute to clarify the nature, extent, and interrelationships of problems and solutions. Even the distinction between problems and solutions is not always clear. For instance, housing {{an increasing number of}} people is a solution that may aggravate the problem of urban overcrowding, and the death of individuals is a problem that contributes to the solution of reducing ecological impact of overpopulation.|$|E

Depending on the vision of what constitutes caipira, Triângulo Mineiro, border areas of Goiás and the remaining parts of Mato Grosso do Sul are included, and the frontier of caipira in Minas Gerais is expanded further northerly, though not reaching metropolitan Belo Horizonte. It is often said that caipira appeared by decreolization of the língua brasílica and the related língua geral paulista, then spoken in almost all {{of what is now}} São Paulo, a former lingua franca in most of the contemporary Centro-Sul of Brazil before the 18th century, brought by the bandeirantes, interior pioneers of Colonial Brazil, closely related to its northern counterpart Nheengatu, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> dialect shows many general differences from other variants of the language.

25|$|The {{depiction}} of the Earth conceived by Homer, which was accepted by the early Greeks, represents a circular flat disk surrounded by a constantly moving stream of Ocean, an idea which would be suggested {{by the appearance of}} the horizon as it is seen from a mountaintop or from a seacoast. Homer's knowledge of the Earth was very limited. He and his Greek contemporaries knew very little of the Earth beyond Egypt as far south as the Libyan desert, the south-west coast of Asia Minor, and the northern boundary of the Greek homeland. Furthermore, the coast of the Black Sea was only known through myths and legends that circulated during his time. In his poems {{there is no mention of}} Europe and Asia as geographical concepts. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> big part of Homer's world that is portrayed on this interpretive map represents lands that border on the Aegean Sea. It is worth noting that even though Greeks believed that they were in the middle of the earth, they also thought that the edges of the world's disk were inhabited by savage, monstrous barbarians and strange animals and monsters; Homer's Odyssey mentions a great many of them.|$|E
25|$|On July 2, 1976 the two-man Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) {{detachment}} of Willow Bunch {{moved to the}} nearby town of Coronach, Saskatchewan after 90 years in Willow Bunch. The then-Assistant Commissioner, J.E. Gibbon, recommended that the RCMP should be moved because of the low population in Willow Bunch. Residents of Willow Bunch strongly disagreed with the move and protested at the Regina Legislature on two different occasions. Two hundred protesters gathered outside the legislature on June 1, 1976. On June 30, 130 protested, demanding to see then-Saskatchewan premier Allan Blakeney. The premier told the angry group that he would not make any commitments other than to consider new facts on the move. Until that confrontation, Attorney General Roy Romanow had been the main government official handling the press and public for the RCMP move. Romanow had said the RCMP advised him that, “one man detachments are of limited value” and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> RCMP would be building a new detachment in the economically prosperous Coronach. The developing Poplar River Power Station in Coronach would be expecting 400 to 500 workers, therefore more police manpower would be needed in the town, he argued.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the Obama sweep in 2008, many Democratic {{candidates}} in contests for lower-level offices also benefited, and many Republican incumbents were replaced by Democrats in the Harris County courthouse. Some of the defeated Republican district court judges were later re-appointed to vacant District Court benches by Governor Rick Perry. Republicans continue to hold all statewide offices after the 2014 elections, including all nine slots on each of the two high courts, but Harris County still has a mix of Democratic and Republican district court judges. All members of the two courts of appeals in the old Harris County Courthouse, by contrast, are Republicans. They are elected from an appellate district that includes Harris County, but also includes nine other counties that are more conservative and vote more Republican. Any generalizations about political leanings and voting patterns of the local electorate must take into consideration the geographic area/jurisdiction, and the same goes for public-opinion polls. Whether elections for local offices coincide with presidential elections or midterm elections also matters because turnout and composition of the voting segment of the electorate differ. The City of Houston, which overlaps with Harris County in part, but represents a smaller and more urban area and electorate, is even more liberal. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> city can elect a mayor who is not only a Democrat, but openly gay. (Mayoral elections are nominally nonpartisan).|$|E
