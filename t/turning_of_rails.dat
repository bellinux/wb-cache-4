30|$|Rail freight {{transport}} {{plays an important}} role in creating a sustainable and competitive transport market, but has lost ground to other competing modes of transport, particularly road. The freight market is driven by a mix of external influences, including spatial planning, the decline of bulk traffic such as coal, and the arrival of a competent, aggressive and commercially competitive alternative. Transport demand is evolving, both in terms of cargo characteristics and customer requirements, and will continue to change in response to industrial and consumer needs. For example since the 1970 s, containerised/unitised cargo and door-to-door (rather than terminal-to-terminal) transport service have become widely accepted, normal phenomena. Rail has been slow to respond to such changes, for example by failing to co-operate with transport chain partners to offer a door-to-door service. Consequently rail has lost market share. National rail policies across Europe have been set by governments and increasingly focused on cost containment and network contraction. Recognising this, a wide-ranging series of measures has been instigated by the European Commission, to <b>turn</b> the position <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> freight into a more attractive and competitive offering and this work is ongoing and evolving. The four articles in this topical collection address these issues and propose future developments in rail freight.|$|R

40|$|Rail track {{undergoes}} complex loading patterns under {{moving traffic}} conditions compared to roads {{due to its}} continued and discontinued multi-layered structure, including rail, sleepers, ballast layer, sub-ballast layer, and subgrade. Particle size distributions (PSDs) of ballast, subballast, and subgrade layers can be critical in cyclic plastic deformation <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> track under moving traffic on frequent track degradation <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> tracks, especially at bridge transition zones. Conventional test approaches: static shear and cyclic single-point load tests are however unable to replicate actual loading patterns of moving train. Multi-ring shear apparatus; {{a new type of}} torsional simple shear apparatus, which can reproduce moving traffic conditions, was used in this study to investigate influence of particle size distribution <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> track layers on cyclic plastic deformation. Three particle size distributions, using glass beads were examined under different loading patterns: cyclic sin-gle-point load, and cyclic moving wheel load to evaluate cyclic plastic deformation <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> track under different loading methods. The results of these tests suggest that particle size distributions <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> track structural layers have significant impacts on cyclic plastic deformation under moving train load. Further, the limitations in con-ventional test methods used in laboratories to estimate the plastic deformation <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> track materials lead to underestimate the plastic deformation <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> tracks...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Calculation of {{a railway}} track on the {{strength}} {{is one of the}} sections of the overall complex research problems of interaction track and rolling stock. This paper describes the experimental study of horizontal transverse stiffness <b>of</b> railway <b>rails</b> with various strands <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> fasteners. Materials <b>of</b> this article should be relevant and will make it possible to calculate the strength of railway track using the correct and corrected performance of horizontal transverse stiffness <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> threads. Methodology. Determination of horizontal transverse rigidity <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> yarns with different designs <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> fasteners was conducted by measuring the quantities of transverse displacement <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> calculation points – namely the head and sole. For research the specialist equipment was created, made up of lineside jack DC- 20, equipped with a hydraulic pressure gauge to measure pressure and rigid rod for horizontal rail stop in the thread, the opposite of the jack. Lateral movement of the head and sole of the track were recorded, and measured with indicators of clock type within a few hundredths of a millimeter. The horizontal lateral load on the rail jack was created by the injection pressure in the cylinder which was fixed with manometer into the jack. Load <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> was conducted over 2 tons of degrees ranging from 0 to 8 tons. To obtain reliable measurement results of lateral movement of the head and the base rails, its movement was conducted for each type fasteners not less than in 3 sections. Measurements were carried out without the creation of vertical load. Findings. With the developed method was found transverse displacement magnitude <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> calculation points at different designs <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> fasteners. Originality. The experimental studies were first found the mentioned horizontal transverse stiffness <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> threads in the head and sole of modern designs for different rail fasteners. Practical value. The values of horizontal transverse stiffness <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> threads in the head and sole of modern designs for different rail fasteners that were found by the author make it possible to calculate the strength of railway track using correct and corrected values of these characteristics. ...|$|R
