40|$|Alpha-adrenergic-mediated {{coronary}} vasoconstriction during stress such as cold pressor testing {{may contribute}} to myocardial ischemia by increasing coronary vascular resistance in patients with severe coronary artery disease. Nonselective alpha-receptor blockade with phen-tolamine abolishes both the peripheral and coronary vasoconstriction during cold pressor testing, but causes reflex tachycardia and increased inotropy. To determine the role of selective alpha 1 -receptor blockade, the changes in coronary vascular resistance during cold pressor testing were measured in 18 patients with coronary artery disease before and after intravenous administration of 100 mg of <b>trimazosin.</b> Cold pressor testing was performed at a constant paced subanginal heart rate of 95 ± 5 beats/min (± 1 SD). Before <b>trimazosin,</b> cold pressor testing increased mean arterial pressure by 9 ± 4 % (102 ± 14 to 111 ± 14 mm Hg, p < 0. 001) with no change in coronary sinus blood flow, but significantly increased coronary vascular resistance by 15 ± 19 % (1. 02 ± 0. 46 to 1. 15 ± 0. 57 units, p < 0. 05). Five minutes after <b>trimazosin,</b> cold pressor testing increased mean arterial pressure by 6 ± 5 % (p < 0. 001) with a marked attenuation {{of the increase in}} coronary vascular resistance (6 ± 11 %, p = NS), which was significantly less than before <b>trimazosin</b> (p < 0. 02). <b>Trimazosin</b> did not increase plasma norepinephrine concentration at rest, suggesting that in the dosage used <b>trimazosin</b> caused selective alpha 1 -receptor blockade. These data suggest that although the hypertensive response to cold pressor testing is somewhat blunted by selective alpha 1,-adrenoceptor blockade, the reflex coronary vasoconstriction during adrenergic stimulation in some patients with coronary artery disease can be significantly attenuated. Use of agents that block alpha 2 -adrenoceptors has been clinically unsatisfactory because of the adverse myocardial effects of increased norepinephrine release. Selective alpha 1 -receptor blockade may have an additional advantage over nonselective alpha-adrenergic blockade in that the release of norepinephrine is also attenuated, thus potentially producing less augmentation of heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand...|$|E
40|$|Seven {{patients}} with severe heart failure resistant to conventional treatment with digoxin and diuretics were given <b>trimazosin,</b> a new mixed arterial and venous vasodilator.

40|$|Ventricular {{fibrillation}} (VF) in conscious rats with {{coronary artery}} ligation occurs in two phases, before (phase 1) and after (phase 2) 90 [*]min of ischaemia respectively. The mechanisms of phase 2 VF are not established. Interestingly, phase 2 VF is absent in isolated (denervated) buffer-perfused rat hearts. We investigated whether catecholamine supplementation (to mimic sympathetic drive) {{was sufficient to}} restore phase 2 VF in such hearts. Isolated rat hearts (n= 10 per group) underwent coronary ligation for 240 [*]min. At 90 [*]min, {{during a period of}} relative electrical stability, the perfusion solution was switched from standard (Krebs) to identical solution or Krebs containing catecholamines (313 [*]nM noradrenaline and 75 [*]nM adrenaline) with or without 10 [*]μM <b>trimazosin</b> (an α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist) or 10 [*]μM atenolol (a β 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist). Although in all groups the incidence of phase 1 VF was high (80 [*]–[*] 100 %), the temporal distribution of VF was monophasic, i. e. only one heart in one group developed phase 2 VF (P=NS). Other ventricular arrhythmias (e. g., tachycardia; VT) exhibited a similar temporal distribution. Nevertheless, haemodynamic changes confirmed sympathomimetic effects of catecholamines, e. g., heart rate was increased from 278 ± 7 beats[*]min− 1 in controls to 335 ± 8 beats[*]min− 1 (P< 0. 05) by catecholamines, an effect that could be blocked by atenolol (285 ± 7 beats[*]min− 1) but not by <b>trimazosin</b> (342 ± 12 beats[*]min− 1). Coronary flow was correspondingly increased from 7. 7 ± 0. 7 [*]ml[*]min− 1 [*]g− 1 to 16. 5 ± 1. 3 [*]ml[*]min− 1 [*]g− 1 (P< 0. 05); this effect could be blocked by atenolol (8. 1 ± 0. 6 [*]ml[*]min− 1 [*]g− 1) and was enhanced by <b>trimazosin</b> (20. 7 ± 2. 4 [*]ml[*]min− 1 [*]g− 1). In conclusion, despite evidence of adequate α- and β-adrenoceptor activation, catecholamine supplementation to isolated buffer-perfused rat hearts was insufficient to restore phase 2 VF.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{availability}} of echocardiography has allowed direct determinations of left ventricular wall thickness and calculation of left ventricular mass. As a result, {{the past decade}} has witnessed a remarkable evolution in our understanding of structural changes in the heart. Moreover, cardiac hypertrophy was found to be reversible by some forms of therapy. In general, reduction of left ventricular mass became evident after 8 to 12 weeks of antihypertensive therapy. Sympatholytics (including methyldopa and reserpine), converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril and enalapril), and calcium entry blockers led to significant regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. On the other hand, arteriolar vasodilators (hydralazine, <b>trimazosin,</b> and minoxidil) were not associated with regression of hypertrophy despite adequate blood pressure control. Finally, data regarding diuretics and / 3 -blockers are controversial. These differences in results among various antihypertensive drugs reflect the multiplicity of factors modulating left ventricular hypertrophy.

40|$|Antihypertensive {{activity}} can be {{induced by the}} following types of drugs: alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists; beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers); and alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonists (in the central nervous system). After a general survey of peripheral and central alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, including their modern classification and subdivision, {{attention was paid to}} the various drugs with antihypertensive activity based upon interaction with various alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. Of the peripheral alpha-adrenoceptor blockers, only those selective for alpha 1 -adrenoceptors are useful antihypertensives. Prazosin and its successors (doxazosin, terazosin, <b>trimazosin)</b> are the best-known examples of such drugs. Their mode of action, and the low incidence and degree of reflex tachycardia, can be satisfactorily explained on the basis of alpha 1 -adrenoceptor blockade in the periphery and possibly also in the CNS. Urapidil is a selective alpha 1 -adrenoceptor blocker with an additional central component not based upon interaction with alpha-adrenoceptors. With respect to centrally acting alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonists, clonidine, guanfacine and alpha-methyldopa are the prototypes. Their antihypertensive activity is triggered by the stimulation of central alpha 2 -adrenoceptors in the brain stem, causing reduced peripheral sympathetic activity and hence a fall in blood pressure and heart rate. Sedation, a common side effect of these drugs, is assumed to be mediated by alpha 2 -adrenoceptors at cortical sites. Although beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents (beta-blockers) are widely and successfully used as antihypertensives, their mode of action is still poorly understood, only hypotheses being available at present. However, their side effects can be rationally explained on the basis of beta-adrenoceptor blockad...|$|E
40|$|Selective alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonists, {{which can}} be used as antihypertensives, cause {{dilation}} of both resistance and capacitance vessels, as a result of alpha 1 -adrenoceptor blockade at postsynaptic sites. Reflex tachycardia is weak or absent, owing to the following mechanisms: (1) The absence of presynaptic alpha 2 -receptor blockade, thus preventing the accelerated release of noradrenaline from the nerve endings; and (2) the blockade of central alpha 1 -adrenoceptors, causing a blunting of the reflex tachycardia via the baroreceptor mechanism. Prazosin and its successor drugs doxazosin, <b>trimazosin</b> and terazosin are the prototypes of selective alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonists. Urapidil, labetalol and ketanserin are well-known examples of hybrid drugs, which possess additional pharmacological activities besides their alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonistic potency. Labetalol is predominantly a (beta 1 + beta 2) -blocker with much weaker alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonistic activity. The compound contains four stereoisomers with different pharmacodynamic properties and as such is not a true hybrid drug. Ketanserin is a selective 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 HT 2) -receptor antagonist, with modest alpha 1 -adrenoceptor activity. Urapidil, a selective alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist, simultaneously displays central hypotensive activity which, unlike that of clonidine and related drugs, is not mediated by alpha 2 -adrenoceptors. Urapidil is also a weak beta 1 -blocker. It consists of one single molecule without stereoisomers and is therefore a true hybrid drug, combining two or more activities in the same molecule. Urapidil's obvious central hypotensive activity, which is caused by an unusual, so far unknown mechanism, is an interesting feature, which may contribute to the absence of reflex tachycardi...|$|E
40|$|The role of catecholamines in the {{production}} of ischaemia-induced ventricular arrhythmias in vivo and in vitro was studied using coronary artery ligation in the rat. Increases in plasma catecholamine concentrations during coronary artery ligation in pentobarbitone-anaesthetized animals were prevented by either acute adrenalectomy or chronic adrenal demedullation, but these procedures did not protect against the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. Thus plasma catecholamines were not obligatory mediators of arrhythmogenesis. Three protocols were used in vitro to evaluate the possible influence of intramyocardial release of noradrenaline, produced by the local conditions of ischaemia, on {{the production}} of ventricular arrhythmias. During coronary artery ligation in isolated perfused hearts, no enhanced output of 3 H could be detected from [3 H]-noradrenaline loaded hearts, even in the presence of inhibitors of catecholamine uptake processes, although washout of lactate from ischaemic regions was readily demonstrable. Both optical isomers of propranolol were equally effective in reducing the incidence of arrhythmias, implying a non-specific effect, since the (+) -isomer possesses considerably less beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity. The equipotency of optical isomers of propranolol combined with a lack of effect of atenolol suggested that arrhythmia production was not a consequence of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. The alpha-adrenoceptor blockers phentolamine and prazosin, both exerted antiarrhythmic actions of similar potency, but phenoxybenzamine and <b>trimazosin</b> had no significant effects. An evaluation of the pharmacological properties of the alpha-adrenoceptor blockers showed that those drugs which had demonstrable local anaesthetic properties also exerted significant antiarrhythmic effects. No relationship was found between potency of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade and antiarrhythmic efficacy. The overall conclusion from these multifaceted approaches was that catecholamines were not necessary mediators of the early phase of ventricular arrhythmias in the rat...|$|E
