5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 20th century Janáček {{composed}} choral church music including Otčenáš (Our Father, 1901), Constitutes (1903) and Ave Maria (1904). In 1901 the first part of his piano cycle On an Overgrown Path was published, and gradually became one of his most frequently performed works. In 1902 Janáček visited Russia twice. On the first occasion he took his daughter Olga to St.Petersburg, where she stayed to study Russian. Only three months later, he returned to St. Petersburg with his wife because Olga had become very ill. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> back to Brno, but her health worsened. Janáček expressed his painful feelings for his daughter in a new work, his opera Jenůfa, in which the suffering of his daughter had transfigured into Jenůfa's. When Olga died in February 1903, Janáček dedicated Jenůfa to her memory. The opera was performed in Brno in 1904, with reasonable success, but Janáček felt this was no more than a provincial achievement. He aspired to recognition by the more influential Prague opera, but Jenůfa was refused there (twelve years passed before its first performance in Prague). Dejected and emotionally exhausted, Janáček went to Luhačovice spa to recover. There he met Kamila Urválková, whose love story supplied the theme for his next opera, Osud (Destiny).|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} day of the oral {{examinations}} in May 1943, Bloeme's non-Jewish boyfriend warned her that the Germans were looking for her. She asked the school board to administer all 12 of her examinations at once, and she received her high school diploma that same day. When the Germans arrived, <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> to an assembly point for Amsterdam Jews, but she managed to enter the building without being registered. A few days later, she sneaked out with a group of younger teens. At first she hid in the home of Christian friends of her parents who worked in the Dutch underground, but they were afraid that if they were arrested, Bloeme would be, too. She spent the next year hiding in 15 to 16 different places, including an Amsterdam old-age home and a job as a maid for a widow and her son in Rotterdam. When she returned to the people who worked in the underground, she was arrested and sent to Westerbork.|$|E

5|$|After escaping, Cornfoot {{made her}} way to the village of Leuchars, eight miles from Pittenweem, where she was either {{discovered}} by the minister, George Gordon, or had approached him for help. For the reward of £10, he arranged an armed guard of two men to return her to Cowper's house on 30 January 1705. Cowper was not at home when they arrived so she was taken to one of the bailies. A mob of at least ten people forcibly removed her from the house, tied her up, beat her, then hauled her down to the harbour by her ankles, possibly with the intention of dunking her. A rope was run from the top of the masthead on a ship back to the shore and she was dangled from it while the crowd threw stones at her as she swung backwards and forwards. When <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> down, she was covered by a door that had heavy stones placed on top of it until she was crushed to death. A cart pulled by a horse was guided over her corpse more than once to ensure she was dead. The crowd took her body to the home of her co-accused, Nicolas Lawson, with the intention of torturing her in the same manner but decided they had sufficient sport for the day.|$|E

Valor por Tamaulipas does not believe this version, however. The admin said he had reasons to believe that @Miut3 was targeted for her online activities.

2500|$|Similarly, the Rabbis {{taught that}} when Rebekah died, her bier was not taken {{out in public}} because of Esau. When Rebekah died, the people asked who would go {{out in front of}} her body, for Abraham had died, Isaac sat at home unable to see, Jacob had gone to Paddan Aram, and if Esau went {{out in front of her}}, people would curse her for raising such a person as Esau. So <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> bier out at night. Rabbi Jose bar Hanina taught that because <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> bier out at night, Scripture does not openly {{describe}} her death, but only alludes to it in [...] Rabbi Jose bar Hanina read [...] to say, [...] "Deborah, Rebekah's nurse died, [...] [...] [...] and he called it the Weeping Oak," [...] for they wept twice, for while Jacob was mourning for Deborah, the news of Rebekah's death reached him.

2500|$|HMS Admiral Rainier was a Dutch 16-gun brig {{that the}} British {{captured}} on 23 August 1800 at Kuyper's Island, Java. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> into service and named her after Admiral Peter Rainier, {{the leader of}} the British expedition.

She returned to British service, only to be captured and recaptured by vessels of the EIC. Her ultimate fate is unknown.|$|E

A total of eight women and two men presided over this [...] "trial"; Elizabeth Young, however, had by then absented herself as she was not part of Douglas' [...] "Heavy Squad".
