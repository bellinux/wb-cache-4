5|$|After Pete George's {{retirement}} in 1987, the upkeep of <b>the</b> <b>Wreck</b> fell directly upon {{the shoulders of}} <b>the</b> <b>Wreck</b> Drivers and Reck Club. In 1994, the Hapeville Plant ended their relationship with Reck Club. Since then, <b>the</b> <b>Wreck</b> has been student maintained {{with the assistance of}} local Atlanta garages. <b>The</b> <b>Wreck</b> has had numerous mechanical and cosmetic repairs over the years since Pete George's initial full rebuild.|$|E
5|$|Dean Dull {{initiated}} a {{group known as}} the Ramblin' Wreck Committee of the Student Council to aid in his search for a mascot. When <b>the</b> <b>Wreck</b> was found in 1961, the Ramblin' Wreck Committee was chaired by Dekle Rountree. Rountree would drive <b>the</b> <b>Wreck</b> for school functions and Student Council fundraisers. He {{was also the first}} person to drive the Ramblin' Wreck onto Grant Field. Don Gentry, the president of Reck Club in 1961, was the first student to drive <b>the</b> <b>Wreck</b> as he aided in retrieving the Model A from Ted Johnson's home. <b>The</b> <b>Wreck</b> was always maintained by Reck Club but the complete transition of control occurred between 1964–1967. During this period, Reck Club was relieved of its RAT rules enforcement duties and given more wholesome jobs of maintaining <b>the</b> <b>Wreck,</b> upholding traditions, and generating school spirit.|$|E

5|$|On June 15, 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Wreck</b> was {{involved}} in an accident while being towed to a wedding south of Atlanta in a covered car trailer. The trailer failed while carrying <b>the</b> <b>Wreck,</b> in turn causing the truck and trailer to run {{off the road and}} into the roadside ditch. <b>The</b> <b>Wreck</b> fell over inside the trailer, causing damage to its side and roof.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>wreck</b> of the SS Vina, a cargo steamer {{built in}} 1894, {{can be seen}} at low tide. In 1944, she was {{anchored}} offshore for use as an RAF target when a gale dragged her to her present location and sank her. After the war, some of <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> was salvaged as scrap. The remains of the Vina are accessible at low tide, but visiting them is potentially hazardous as <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> is quickly cut off and submerged by the incoming tide. A warning sign on <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> advises anyone reaching it to return to the beach immediately.|$|E
50|$|Thunderball {{possesses}} a virtually indestructible wrecking ball {{attached to a}} 4 ft chain, enchanted by the Wrecker's power. <b>The</b> <b>wrecking</b> ball, when thrown, is capable of returning to Thunderball {{in a similar fashion}} as Wrecker's crowbar and Thor's hammer. With effort, Thunderball can even control the path it takes on its return. Thunderball can spin <b>the</b> <b>wrecking</b> ball on its chain fast enough to deflect bullets and automatic gunfire. By slamming <b>the</b> <b>wrecking</b> ball on <b>the</b> ground, Thunderball can cause minor localized quakes, knocking his opponents off-balance. <b>The</b> <b>wrecking</b> ball is also durable enough to be thrown into vehicles, buildings, and other structures, knocking them down with no damage to itself. In the past, the Hulk and Hercules have both destroyed <b>the</b> <b>wrecking</b> ball. When this happens, Thunderball doesn't suffer any ill psychic effects from <b>the</b> <b>wrecking</b> ball's destruction. He can recreate the weapon by obtaining a new wrecking ball and having the Wrecker enchant it for him.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, <b>the</b> <b>wrecking</b> {{ball was}} {{described}} as [...] "one {{of the most common}} forms of large-scale coarse demolition." [...] Although <b>the</b> <b>wrecking</b> ball is still {{the most efficient way to}} raze a concrete frame structure, its use is decreasing. With the invention of hydraulic excavators and other machinery, <b>the</b> <b>wrecking</b> ball has become less common at demolition sites as its working efficiency is less than that of high reach excavators.|$|R
50|$|With <b>the</b> <b>Wrecking</b> Crew, Bulldozer next battled Captain America and Iron Fist {{while trying}} to lure Thor into battle. <b>The</b> <b>Wrecking</b> Crew then did battle Thor. <b>The</b> <b>Wrecking</b> Crew were among the various criminals taken to the Beyonder's Battleworld, {{including}} a number of super-powered criminals and superheroes.

Along with <b>the</b> <b>Wrecking</b> Crew, Bulldozer next joined the fourth Masters of Evil, which attacked and took over Avengers Mansion. Bulldozer helped defeat the god Hercules in combat, but was drained of his superhuman powers by Thor. He was freed from prison by the Wrecker, but without his superhuman powers he was defeated by Spider-Man and Spider-Woman. With <b>the</b> <b>Wrecking</b> Crew, Camp freed the Wrecker and Ulik from prison from police custody. He regained his powers, and battled Hercules, Thor, Excalibur, Code: Blue, and Ghost Rider. His powers were then again drained by Loki.|$|R

5|$|In August 2015, {{members of}} the Dutch sport-diving club Duikteam Zeester dove on <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> of the Mainz and {{retrieved}} a variety of prosaic artifacts, including a sextant and the engine telegraph. Their actions provoked criticism from German sources, who noted that <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> was a war grave containing the remains of 89 crew members and thus should not be disturbed. The German Federal Police were investigating the incident.|$|E

[...] Some of <b>the</b> other <b>Wrecking</b> Crew percussionists were Julius Wechter, Milt Holland, Gene Estes, and Victor Feldman. [...] Drummer Jim Keltner is sometimes mentioned in connection with <b>the</b> <b>Wrecking</b> Crew, because he befriended Hal Blaine in the 1960s and would later play with <b>the</b> <b>Wrecking</b> Crew on John Lennon's Rock 'n' Roll album recorded in 1973, but he is more often associated with the later generation of session players who eclipsed <b>the</b> <b>Wrecking</b> Crew in terms of popularity during the 1970s.|$|R

5|$|Ohioans post-war {{career was}} {{relatively}} uneventful until 8 October 1936, {{when she ran}} aground near Seal Rock at the Golden Gate, the entrance to San Francisco Bay. Attempts to free the ship were unsuccessful and, because of the close proximity of <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> to San Francisco, the grounded Ohioan drew large crowds to watch salvage operations. Angelo J. Rossi, the mayor of San Francisco, toured <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> on 19 October. Ohioans hulk caught fire in March 1937, and <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> broke into two pieces in a storm in December. As late as 1939, some of Ohioans rusty steel beams were still visible on the rocks.|$|E

5000|$|The reef is a {{navigation}} hazard {{because it}} projects into the shipping channel, {{as evidenced by}} (at least) seven shipwrecks.

5|$|There {{are several}} lesser known details about <b>the</b> <b>Wreck</b> that are easily missed when it rambles down Techwood Drive.

25|$|Investigations of <b>the</b> {{aircraft}} <b>wrecks</b> {{were carried}} out by the Armed Forces Museum in 1986, which in cooperation with the NTNU Museum of Natural History and Archaeology succeeded at finding both the Heinkel and the Junkers.
