5|$|Several {{nightjar}} {{species are}} known to be more likely <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> the two weeks before the full moon than the during the waning moon, possibly because insect food may be easier to catch as the moon waxes. A study specifically looking at the European nightjar showed that the phase of the moon is a factor for birds laying in June, but not for earlier breeders. This strategy means that a second brood in July would also have a favourable lunar aspect.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, 5million {{birds were}} {{estimated}} to be killed for their feathers. They were shot usually in the spring, when their feathers were colored for mating and nesting. The plumes, or aigrettes, as they were called in the millinery business, sold for $32 an ounce in 1915— the price of gold. Millinery was a $17million a year industry that motivated plume harvesters <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> watch of nests of egrets and many colored birds during the nesting season, shoot the parents with small-bore rifles, and leave the chicks to starve. Plumes from Everglades wading birds {{could be found in}} Havana, New York City, London, and Paris. Hunters could collect plumes from a hundred birds on a good day.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} season saw Rosenborg finish {{sixth in}} the league. Ahead of the 1980 season, Iversen was bought from Vålerengen for NOK50,000. The team finished fifth in the league. Rosenborg was missing a playmaker <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> the central midfield. Ahead of the 1981 season, Rosenborg signed Sverre Brandhaug for NOK100,000, {{the first time the}} club had to pay to sign local talent. The first 16 May game—held the evening before Constitution Day—was played that season, which became an annual event which most seasons became the most-spectated match. Attendance skyrocketed, with the Vålerengen match drawing 21,000 people. Although leading the league through most of the season, the team lost the four last matches, and ended in third place. Eggen concluded that while the team had many good individual players, they lacked sufficient cooperative coordination, which would later be the essence of his philosophy. In the 1982 season, where the team finished {{sixth in the}} league, Iversen was mostly used as a reserve; he retired afterwards and was given the club's first testimonial match.|$|E

500|$|David Denby in The New Yorker {{compared}} Nolan's cinematic {{treatment of}} dreams to Luis Buñuel's in Belle de Jour (1967) and The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972). He criticized Nolan's [...] "literal-minded" [...] action level sequencing compared to Buñuel, who [...] "silently pushed us into reveries and left us alone to enjoy our wonderment, but Nolan {{is working on}} so many levels of representation at once that he has <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> pages of dialogue just to explain what's going on." [...] The latter captures [...] "the peculiar malign intensity of actual dreams." ...|$|E
500|$|On 22 May 1810, Alceste {{encountered}} some French feluccas — lightly-armed merchant vessels with lateen rigs — {{that were}} forced to seek refuge under the guns of the bay of Agay. Under cover of darkness, two boats from Alceste, one under Lieutenant Andrew Wilson, the other led by the ship's master, Henry Bell, attacked the shore batteries. This was only partially successful; Wilson was unable to achieve his objective, while Bell's section managed to spike the guns of the second battery but only after taking heavy fire. Alceste stood out to sea for three days, and {{on the night of}} 25 May, Maxwell sent two armed boats <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> wait in a rocky cove. The following morning Alceste set sail. The French, assuming Alceste had [...] gone, attempted to leave, but the two British boats lying in ambush attacked. Despite fierce resistance and fire from the guns on shore, four ships of the French convoy were captured and two driven on to the rocks. The remainder made it safely back to their anchorage.|$|E
500|$|In October 1562 the Queen {{fell ill}} with {{smallpox}} and, believing {{her life to}} be in danger, she asked the Privy Council to make Robert Dudley Protector of the Realm and {{to give him a}} suitable title together with twenty thousand pounds a year. There was universal relief when she recovered her health; Dudley was made a privy councillor. He was already deeply involved in foreign politics, including Scotland. In 1563 Elizabeth suggested Dudley as a consort to the widowed Mary, Queen of Scots, the idea being to achieve firm amity between England and Scotland and diminish the influence of foreign powers. Elizabeth's preferred solution was that they should all live together at the English court, so that she would not have to forgo her favourite's company. Mary of Scotland at first enquired if Elizabeth was serious, wanting above all to know her chances of inheriting the English crown. Elizabeth repeatedly declared that she was only prepared to acknowledge Mary as her heir on condition that she marry Robert Dudley. Mary's Protestant advisors warmed to the prospect of having Dudley as their prince, and in September 1564 he was created Earl of Leicester, a move designed to make him more acceptable to Mary. In January 1565 Thomas Randolph, the English ambassador to Scotland, was told by the Scottish queen that she would accept the proposal. To his amazement, Dudley was not to be moved to comply: But a man of that nature I never found any ... he whom I go about to make as happy as ever was any, to put him in possession of a kingdom, <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> his naked arms a most fair ... lady ... nothing regardeth the good that shall ensue unto him thereby ... but so uncertainly dealeth that I know not where to find him. Dudley indeed had made it clear to the Scots at the beginning that he was not a candidate for Mary's hand and forthwith had behaved with passive resistance. He also worked in the interest of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, Mary's eventual choice of husband. Elizabeth herself wavered as to declaring Mary her heir, until in March 1565 she decided she could not bring herself to it. Still, she finally told the Spanish ambassador that the proposal fell through because the Earl of Leicester refused to cooperate.|$|E
