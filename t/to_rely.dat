5|$|A general problem {{existed in}} powerplants. The He 111 was {{equipped}} with BMW VI glycol-cooled engines. The German aviation industry lacked powerplants that could produce more than 600 hp. Engines of suitable quality were kept for military use, frustrating German airline Luft Hansa and forcing it <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on the BMW VI or 132s.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time Gloria was making {{landfall}} on Long Island, a storm warning was issued for western New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Across Atlantic Canada, the threat of Hurricane Gloria caused many citizens <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on American media for storm coverage.|$|E

5|$|Forced <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on UHF to expand, DuMont saw one station {{after another}} go dark due to dismal ratings. It bought small, distressed UHF station KCTY (channel 25) in Kansas City, Missouri in 1954, but ran it for {{just three months}} before {{shutting}} it down at a considerable loss after attempting to compete with three established VHF stations.|$|E
5|$|In June 1967, the French {{government}} announced their {{withdrawal from the}} AFVG project ostensibly {{on the grounds of}} cost. The collapse of the AFVG programme was considerably troubling to the British position, having chosen <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on Anglo-French collaboration and American-designed combat aircraft to meet its needs.|$|E

5|$|Militarily, it is {{difficult}} to draw many lessons from Salamis, because of the uncertainty about what actually happened. Once again the Allies chose their ground well in order to negate Persian numbers, but this time (unlike Thermopylae) had <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on the Persians launching an unnecessary attack for their position to count. (Hale, John R.).|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to use English-speaking actors was made early. Since the film would be very visual, the director wanted audiences {{to be able to}} focus on the images, and not have <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on subtitles. He later expressed his approval of the use of dubbed voice tracks in non-English speaking countries.|$|E
50|$|Organizational {{strategies}} may be extremely helpful {{for an individual}} with visual agnosia. For example, organizing clothes according to different hangers provides tactile cues for the individual, {{making it easier to}} identify certain forms of clothing as opposed <b>to</b> <b>relying</b> solely on visual cues.|$|R
50|$|The LRA and the Code {{also do not}} {{stipulate}} on what facts {{the employer}} may <b>rely</b> <b>to</b> prove the contravention. The Industrial Court has given conflicting opinions on whether the employer is restricted <b>to</b> <b>relying</b> on those facts which {{are available at the}} time of the enquiry, or whether he may also rely on facts which came to light after the dismissal. It is submitted that the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration will probably adopt the second approach.|$|R
50|$|A related {{concept is}} to {{deliberately}} force {{a section of}} the grid into a condition that will guarantee the DG systems will disconnect. This is similar to the transfer-trip method, but uses active systems at the head-end of the utility, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>relying</b> on the topology of the network.|$|R

5|$|Whilst {{the escape}} of the German fleet from the {{superior}} British firepower at Jutland was effected by the German cruisers and destroyers successfully turning away the British battleships, the German attempt <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on U-boat {{attacks on the}} British fleet failed.|$|E
5|$|All {{properties}} {{which had}} been confiscated by Domitian were returned to their respective families. Nerva also sought to involve the Senate in his government, {{but this was not}} entirely successful. He continued <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> largely on friends and advisors that were known and trusted, and by maintaining friendly relations with the pro-Domitianic faction of the Senate, he incurred hostility which may have been the cause for at least one conspiracy against his life.|$|E
50|$|To prevent {{spoofing}} or denial-of-service attacks, CRLs usually carry {{a digital}} signature {{associated with the}} CA by which they are published.

5|$|Andretti {{found little}} success after 1978 in Formula One– {{he failed to}} win another grand prix. He had a {{difficult}} year in 1979, as the new Lotus 80 was not competitive, and the team had <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on the Lotus 79 which had been overtaken by the second generation of ground effect cars. In 1980, he was paired with the young Italian Elio de Angelis, and briefly with test driver Nigel Mansell, but the team was again unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|As Buxton's trade {{fell into}} decline {{he tried to}} survive by working as a botanical {{collector}} and delivering newspapers, but eventually had <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on a fund set up by Binney for ‘the relief and encouragement of scientific men in humble life’. This situation was compounded when the proceeds from the second edition of his book, published in 1859, were less than anticipated because of competition from Grindon's Manchester Flora published in the same year.|$|E
5|$|BackupHDDVD {{represented}} {{the first known}} successful attack against AACS. The utility circumvents content protection by decrypting video files directly with AES, the underling cryptographic cipher used by AACS. Using this technique, BackupHDDVD is able to completely bypass the AACS chain of trust, rendering it immune to revocation. The cost of this immunity is that users are forced <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on keys leaking from commercial player software to use BackupHDDVD with new discs.|$|E

He usually focused on creating his own chord structures and melodies using synthesizers, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>relying</b> on sampling {{the work of}} others.

5|$|Beebe's {{position}} in the Zoological Society underwent a change in 1918: He was given the title of Honorary Curator of Birds, and was made {{the director of the}} newly created Department of Tropical Research. With his new position, Beebe no longer had the duty of caring for the zoo's animals, freeing him to devote himself fully to his writing and research. Beebe's duties as curator were passed to Lee Crandall, the former Assistant Curator who had worked under Beebe, although Crandall continued <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on Beebe for help treating illness in birds, and caring for the exotic birds brought back from Beebe's expeditions.|$|E
5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} {{the discourse}} of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E
5|$|Both {{operations}} were {{hampered by the}} German need <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on their Croatian allies {{as well as the}} fact that both forces were ill-equipped for operations in mountainous terrain during extreme winter conditions.
