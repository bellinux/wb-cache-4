5|$|<b>Toothache</b> {{may occur}} at any age, in any gender {{and in any}} {{geographic}} region. Diagnosing and relieving <b>toothache</b> {{is considered one of}} the main responsibilities of dentists. Irreversible pulpitis is thought to be the most common reason that people seek emergency dental treatment. Since dental caries associated with pulpitis is the most common cause, <b>toothache</b> is more common in populations that are at higher risk of dental caries. The prevalence of caries in a population is dependent upon factors such as diet (refined sugars), socioeconomic status, and exposure to fluoride (such as areas without water fluoridation). In the United States, an estimated 12% of the general population reported that they suffered from <b>toothache</b> at some point in the six months before questioning. Individuals aged 18–34 reported much higher experience of <b>toothache</b> than those aged 75 or over. In a survey of Australian schoolchildren, 12% had experienced <b>toothache</b> before the age of five, and 32% by the age of 12. Dental trauma is extremely common and tends to occur more often in children than adults.|$|E

5|$|<b>Toothache</b> is {{the most}} common type of {{orofacial}} pain and, when severe, it is considered a dental emergency, since there may be a significant impact on sleep, eating, and other daily activities. It is one of the most common reasons for emergency dental appointments. Correct diagnosis can sometimes be challenging. The treatment of a <b>toothache</b> depends upon the exact cause, and may involve a filling, root canal treatment, extraction, drainage of pus, or other remedial action. The relief of <b>toothache</b> is considered one of the main responsibilities of dentists. In 2013, 223 million cases of tooth pain occurred as a result of dental caries in permanent teeth and 53 million cases occurred in baby teeth. Historically, the demand for treatment of <b>toothache</b> is thought to have led to the emergence of dental surgery as the first specialty of medicine.|$|E

5|$|<b>Toothache</b> may {{be caused}} by dental (odontogenic) {{conditions}} (such as those involving the dentin-pulp complex or periodontium), or by non-dental (non-odontogenic) conditions (such as maxillary sinusitis or angina pectoris). There are many possible non-dental causes, {{but the vast majority of}} <b>toothache</b> is dental in origin.|$|E
5|$|In Christianity, Saint Apollonia is {{the patron}} saint of <b>toothache</b> and other dental problems. She was an early Christian martyr who was persecuted for her beliefs in Alexandria during the Imperial Roman age. A mob struck her {{repeatedly}} in the face until all her teeth were smashed. She was threatened with being burned alive unless she renounced Christianity, but she instead chose to throw herself onto the fire. Supposedly, <b>toothache</b> sufferers who invoke her name will find relief.|$|E
5|$|Since most <b>toothache</b> is {{the result}} of plaque-related diseases, such as tooth decay and {{periodontal}} disease, the majority of cases could be prevented by avoidance of a cariogenic diet and maintenance of good oral hygiene. That is, reduction in the number times that refined sugars are consumed per day and brushing the teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and flossing. Regular visits to a dentist also increases the likelihood that problems are detected early and averted before <b>toothache</b> occurs. Dental trauma could also be significantly reduced by routine use of mouthguards in contact sports.|$|E

5|$|The chief complaint, and {{the onset}} of the complaint, are usually {{important}} in the diagnosis of <b>toothache.</b> For example, the key distinction between reversible and irreversible pulpitis is given in the history, such as pain following a stimulus in the former, and lingering pain following a stimulus and spontaneous pain in the latter. History is also important in recent filling or other dental treatment, and trauma to the teeth. Based on the most common causes of <b>toothache</b> (dentin hypersensitivity, periodontitis, and pulpitis), the key indicators become localization of the pain (whether the pain is perceived as originating in a specific tooth), thermal sensitivity, pain on biting, spontaneity of the pain, and factors that make the pain worse.The various qualities of the <b>toothache,</b> such as the effect of biting and chewing on the pain, the effect of thermal stimuli, and the effect of the pain on sleep, are verbally established by the clinician, usually in a systematic fashion, such as using the Socrates pain assessment method (see table).|$|E

5|$|<b>Toothache,</b> {{also known}} as dental pain, is pain in the teeth and/or their {{supporting}} structures, caused by dental diseases or pain referred to the teeth by non-dental diseases.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of the maxillary sinus can be {{referred}} to the upper back teeth. The posterior, middle and anterior superior alveolar nerves are all closely associated with the lining of the sinus. The bone between the floor of the maxillary sinus and the roots of the upper back teeth is very thin, and frequently the apices of these teeth disrupt the contour of the sinus floor. Consequently, acute or chronic maxillary sinusitis can be perceived as maxillary <b>toothache,</b> and neoplasms of the sinus (such as adenoid cystic carcinoma) can cause similarly perceived <b>toothache</b> if malignant invasion of the superior alveolar nerves occurs. Classically, sinusitis pain increases upon Valsalva maneuvers or tilting the head forward.|$|E
5|$|The {{teeth and}} gums exhibit normal sensations in health. Such sensations are {{generally}} sharp, lasting {{as long as}} the stimulus. There is a continuous spectrum from physiologic sensation to pain in disease. Pain is an unpleasant sensation caused by intense or damaging events. In a <b>toothache,</b> nerves are stimulated by either exogenous sources (for instance, bacterial toxins, metabolic byproducts, chemicals, or trauma) or endogenous factors (such as inflammatory mediators).|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1950s Waugh was troubled {{on a number}} of fronts. He was afflicted with writer's block, and was unable to make {{progress}} with his current novel, the second in his Sword of Honour trilogy. He had financial worries, a legacy of his free-spending post-war habits combined with accumulated tax liabilities and a lack of remunerative productivity. His general health was poor; he suffered from <b>toothache,</b> sciatica and rheumatism, and his memory was faulty. He was also drinking heavily, the effects of which were aggravated by a large intake of chloral and bromide washed down with crème de menthe—a treatment for insomnia that he concealed from his doctors.|$|E
5|$|For the dentist, {{the goal}} of {{treatment}} generally is to relieve the pain, and wherever possible to preserve or restore function. The treatment depends on {{the cause of the}} <b>toothache,</b> and frequently a clinical decision regarding the current state and long-term prognosis of the affected tooth, as well as the individual's wishes and ability to cope with dental treatment, will influence the treatment choice. Often, administration of an intra-oral local anesthetic such as lidocaine and epinephrine is indicated in order to carry out pain-free treatment. Treatment may range from simple advice, removal of dental decay with a dental drill and subsequent placement of a filling, to root canal treatment, tooth extraction, or debridement.|$|E
5|$|From the history, {{indicators}} of pulpal, periodontal, {{a combination of}} both, or non-dental causes can be observed. Periodontal pain is frequently localized to a particular tooth, which is made much worse by biting on the tooth, sudden in onset, and associated with bleeding and pain when brushing. More than one factor {{may be involved in}} the <b>toothache.</b> For example, a pulpal abscess (which is typically severe, spontaneous and localized) can cause periapical periodontitis (which results in pain on biting). Cracked tooth syndrome may also cause a combination of symptoms. Lateral periodontitis (which is usually without any thermal sensitivity and sensitive to biting) can cause pulpitis and the tooth becomes sensitive to cold.|$|E

5|$|Pulpitis is {{classified}} as reversible when the pain is mild to moderate and lasts {{for a short time}} after a stimulus (for instance, cold or sweet); or irreversible when the pain is severe, spontaneous, and lasts a long time after a stimulus. Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, then progress to pulp necrosis (death of the pulp) and apical periodontitis. Abscesses usually cause throbbing pain. The apical abscess usually occurs after pulp necrosis, the pericoronal abscess is usually associated with acute pericoronitis of a lower wisdom tooth, and periodontal abscesses usually represent a complication of chronic periodontitis (gum disease). Much less commonly, non-dental conditions can cause <b>toothache,</b> such as maxillary sinusitis, which can cause pain in the upper back teeth, or angina pectoris, which can cause pain in the lower teeth.|$|E
5|$|Though Tucker and Maria {{were warned}} against her having more {{children}} in her vulnerable physical and emotional state, she again conceived, and died in pregnancy in February 1823. In the carriage to Washington after the funeral, Tucker muffled {{his face with a}} handkerchief to hide his tears and feigned a <b>toothache</b> in response to inquirers. Maria's death indeed weighed heavily upon him, as he reflected on his plausible neglect in the midst of her travails. He also was much concerned for his son Daniel's indolence and unbalanced behavior which years later would result in the son's hospitalization and ultimate death in 1838 in Philadelphia.|$|E
