5|$|Plant life {{is heavily}} {{influenced}} by the salt spray, strong winds and acidic peaty soils. No trees grow on the archipelago, although {{there are more than}} 130 different flowering plants, 162 species of fungi and 160 bryophytes. Several rarities exist amongst the 194 lichen species. Kelp <b>thrives</b> <b>in</b> the surrounding seas, which contain a diversity of unusual marine invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|This sparrow {{is found}} in open oak {{woodlands}} and dry uplands with grassy vegetation and bushes. It is often found near rocky outcroppings. The species is also known from coastal scrublands and chaparral areas. The rufous-crowned sparrow <b>thrives</b> <b>in</b> open areas cleared by burning.|$|E

The college has also created two grass variants, Shadow Turf, a drought-tolerant turf grass that <b>thrives</b> <b>in</b> shade, and Tech Turf (marketed as Turffalo), a turf grass with the rich color and texture of Bermuda and the resilience of buffalo grass.|$|E
500|$|Extremophiles are {{microorganisms}} {{that have}} adapted {{so that they}} can survive and even <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> extreme environments that are normally fatal to most life-forms. Thermophiles and hyperthermophiles <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> high temperatures. Psychrophiles <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> extremely low temperatures. – Temperatures as high as , as low as [...] Halophiles <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> high salt conditions, up to saturation. Alkaliphiles <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> an alkaline pH of about 8.5–11. Acidophiles can <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> a pH of 2.0 or less. Piezophiles thrive at very high pressures: up to 1,000-2,000 atm, down to 0 atm as in a vacuum of space. A few extremophiles such as Deinococcus radiodurans are radioresistant, resisting radiation exposure of up to 5k Gy. Extremophiles are significant in different ways. They extend terrestrial life into much of the Earth's hydrosphere, crust and atmosphere, their specific evolutionary adaptation mechanisms to their extreme environment can be exploited in biotechnology, and their very existence under such extreme conditions increases the potential for extraterrestrial life.|$|R

5|$|The fern <b>thrives</b> <b>in</b> thin {{serpentine}} soils on sunny, disturbed habitats such as roadcuts and talus slopes, in dunite {{and other}} ultramafic rocks. Anthropogenic disturbance has removed thicker soils and increased sun exposure {{in many of}} these sites; for instance, many of the Quebec stations are in asbestos mines, both abandoned and active. In more natural habitats, frost weathering and erosion may promote rock fall and maintain suitable habitat.|$|E
5|$|Abundant and widespread, A.obovatus {{occurs on}} a wide range of soils, favouring soils in the acidic pH range 3.9–5.4. Like most Adenanthos species it is common on deeply leached {{siliceous}} sandplain sand. It also occurs on gravelly quartz sand derived from rock outcrops, such as on the rocky hillslopes of the Stirling Range. It is rarely found on gravelly lateritic soils. It is also one of the few Adenanthos species to grow well in moist environments; it will not tolerate seasonal waterlogging—that niche is filled by A.detmoldii—but <b>thrives</b> <b>in</b> damp soils not subject to waterlogging.|$|E
5|$|Plant species {{found at}} this {{elevation}} include Styphelia tameiameiae, Taraxacum officinale, Tetramolopium humile, Agrostis sandwicensis, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Trisetum glomeratum, Poa annua, Sonchus oleraceus, and Coprosma ernodiodes. One notable species is Mauna Kea silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense var. sandwicense), a highly endangered endemic plant species that <b>thrives</b> <b>in</b> Mauna Kea's high elevation cinder deserts. At one stage {{reduced to a}} population of just 50 plants, Mauna Kea silversword {{was thought to be}} restricted to the alpine zone, but in fact has been driven there by pressure from livestock, and can grow at lower elevations as well.|$|E
50|$|It {{grows in}} many climates and will <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> {{many types of}} soil, wet, dry, sandy, or rocky. It even grows in serpentine, a soil that most plants have {{difficulty}} <b>thriving</b> <b>in</b> because of its unique mineral composition.|$|R

5|$|Some {{plants and}} animals are generalists, and their habitat {{requirements}} are met {{in a wide range}} of locations. The small white butterfly (Pieris rapae) for example is found on all the continents of the world apart from Antarctica. Its larvae feed on a wide range of Brassicas and various other plant species, and it <b>thrives</b> <b>in</b> any open location with diverse plant associations. The large blue butterfly is much more specific in its requirements; it is found only in chalk grassland areas, its larvae feed on Thymus species and because of complex lifecycle requirements it inhabits only areas in which Myrmica ants live.|$|E
5|$|The {{dromedary}} has {{not occurred}} in the wild for nearly 2,000 years. Wild dromedaries inhabited arid regions, particularly the Sahara Desert. The original range of the camel’s wild ancestors was probably southern Asia and the Arabian peninsula. Its range included hot, arid regions of northern Africa, Ethiopia, the Near East and western and central Asia. The dromedary typically <b>thrives</b> <b>in</b> areas with a long dry season and a short wet season. They are sensitive to cold and humidity, though some breeds can thrive in humid conditions.|$|E
5|$|Settlers cleared {{much of the}} Catlins' coastal {{vegetation}} for farmland, but in {{some areas}} the original coastal plant life survives, primarily around cliff edges {{and some of the}} bays close to the Tautuku Peninsula, these being furthest from the landward edges of the forest. Plant life here includes many native species adapted to the strong salt-laden winds found in this exposed region. The Catlins coastal daisy (Celmisia lindsayii) is unique to the region, and is related to New Zealand's mountain daisies. Tussocks, hebes, and flaxes are common, as are native gentians, though sadly the endangered native sedge pingao can now rarely be found. In years when the southern rātā flowers well, the coastal forest canopy turns bright red. The rātā also <b>thrives</b> <b>in</b> some inland areas.|$|E
