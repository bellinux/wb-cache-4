40|$|Objective: <b>The</b> <b>Section</b> <b>III</b> of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM- 5) {{proposed}} nine {{diagnostic criteria}} and five cut-point criteria for Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD). We aimed {{to examine the}} efficacy of such criteria. Methods: Adults (n= 3041, men: 1824, women: 1217) who engaged in internet gaming within last 6 months completed a self-report online survey using the suggested wordings of the criteria in DSM- 5. Major characteristics, gaming behavior, and psychiatric symptoms of IGD were analyzed using ANOVA, chi-square, and correlation analyses. Results: The sociodemographic variables {{were not statistically significant}} between the healthy controls and the risk group. Among the participants, 419 (13. 8 %) were identified and labeled as the IGD risk group. The IGD risk group scored significantly higher on all motivation subscales (p< 0. 001). The IGD risk group showed significantly higher scores than healthy controls in all nine psychiatric symptom dimensions, i. e., somatization, obsession-compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: The IGD risk group showed differential psychopathological manifestations according to DSM- 5 IGD diagnostic criteria.

40|$|Abstract—Based on {{the feature}} of model {{disturbances}} and uncertainty being compensated dynamically in auto – disturbances-rejection-controller (ADRC), a new method using ADRC is {{proposed for the}} decoupling control of dispenser longitudinal movement in big flight envelope. Developed from nonlinear model directly, ADRC is especially suitable for dynamic model that has big disturbances. Furthermore, without changing the structure and parameters of the controller in big flight envelope, this scheme can simplify the design of flight control system. The simulation results in big flight envelope show that the system achieves high dynamic performance, steady state performance and the controller has strong robustness. ADRC is briefly introduced. Then, the missile model and longitudinal movement control problems under consideration are described simply in <b>the</b> <b>Section</b> <b>III.</b> In Section IV, the ADRC based on the techniques of ESO is given.

40|$|U prosincu 2011. izvršen je terenski pregled područja izgradnje nove obilaznice grada Zagreba. Na zapadnom dijelu Zagrebačke županije, između čvorova Pojatno i Horvati, nalazi se dionica I, dok je na istočnom dijelu između čvorova Ivanić-Grad i Sveti Ivan Zelina pregledana trasa dionice III. Ukupno je uočeno 41 arheološko nalazište na prvoj, odnosno 19 lokaliteta na drugoj pregledanoj dionici. Većina nalazišta datira se u srednji vijek, iako su evidentirani i nalazi koji se mogu datirati u prapovijest i antiku. Samo su neka nalazišta otprije poznata, a riječ je o nekoliko položaja na trasi dionice I, dok su svi položaji uočeni na trasi dionice III dosada bili nepoznati u stručnoj literaturi. Gustoća lokaliteta pokazuje koncentraciju na plodnim povišenim terasama uz tokove rijeka, prvenstveno na obje obale Save, ali i uz njene pritoke poput Krapine. Slična je situacija uočena i na blagim terasama uz Lonju, ali su zabilježeni i lokaliteti na povišenim položajima, poput onih na brežuljkastom području južnih obronaka Samoborskog gorja. During December 2011 a {{field survey}} of {{the area of the}} {{construction}} of the new bypass of the City of Zagreb was conducted. In the western part of Zagreb County, between junctions Pojatno and Horvati, section I is located, while in the eastern part, between junctions Ivanić-Grad and Sveti Ivan Zelina, the route of <b>the</b> <b>section</b> <b>III</b> was surveyed, and a number of new, previously unknown sites, were noted. A total of 41 archaeological sites were observed on the first, and 19 sites on the second section. Most of the sites can be dated to the Middle Ages, although some finds have been recorded which can be dated to Prehistory and Antiquity. Within section I nine prehistoric and two ancient sites have been found, and within section III four prehistoric and six ancient ones. Only few of these locations have already been known, those beeing the sites located {{on the banks of the}} Sava River, near Zaprešić. Although finds from the Middle Ages prevail, it can be assumed that the number of ancient and prehistoric sites will be significantly increased after the rescue exavations, which will determine the exact extent and type of sites, as well as a period to which each site can be dated with much greater precision. Based on the surface finds, some sites, such as the one in the vicinity of the Lužnica castle near Zaprešić, show the traces of population presence over a longer period; this is hardly surprising given their very favorable position next to river communications, the importance of which they retained to this day. The valley of the Sava River in the vicinity of Zaprešić is already known as a place with the considerable number of ancient sites, but recent surveys have shown a dense population throughout the Middle Ages, as well as the existence of prehistoric settlements and a large number of new sites that have been observed on the hilly area on the slopes of the Samobor hills. We should specially point out new sites from all periods located on <b>the</b> <b>section</b> <b>III</b> between Sveti Ivan Zelina and Ivanić-Grad, since this region is relatively poorly explored...|$|E

Later on, concepts of temperament, character and personality get analysed. Then, the current approach to personality disorders according to the two models of DSM- 5 is reported.

Ultimately, it can be so claimed: 1) diagnostic criteria of the first model {{are similar to those of}} DSM-IV with its respective strenghts and weaknesses, and namely high probability in diagnosis, where  there, of personality disorder, yet insufficient sensitivity in the specification of the disorder; 2) the alternate model, despite criticism, thanks to the possibility of delivering a trait-based personality disorder diagnosis, seems to be more equipped both in the identification of the personality disorder and further specifications...|$|E

UWB band-pass filter (BPF) with {{wireless local area network}} (WLAN) notch at 5. 8 GHz and 3 -dB fractional bandwidth of 108 % using a microstrip structure is presented. Initially a two transmission pole UWB band pass filter in the frequency range 3. 1 - 10. 6 GHz is achieved by design a parallel-coupled microstrip line with defective ground plane structure using GML 1000 substrate with specification: dielectric constant 3. 2 and thickness 0. 762 mm at centre frequency 6. 85 GHz. In this structure a ë/ 4 open circuited stub is introduced to achieve the notch at 5. 8 GHz to avoid the interference with WLAN frequency with lies the desired UWB band. The design structure was simulated on electromagnetic circuit simulation software and fabricated by microwave integrated circuit technique. The measured VNA results show the close agreement with simulated results. low loss and good linearity in the UWB, and easy integration with other circuits and antennas.
