5|$|Cathodoluminescence (CL) — light {{emission}} excited by electron beam — {{is a process}} commonly observed in TV screens. An electron beam can be finely focused and scanned across the studied material. <b>This</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> widely used to study defects in semiconductors and nanostructures with nanometer-scale spatial resolution. It would be beneficial to apply this technique to carbon nanotubes. However, no reliable CL, i.e. sharp peaks assignable to certain (n,m) indices, has been detected from carbon nanotubes yet.|$|E
5|$|Electron-beam {{lithography}} (EBL) is {{a method}} of etching semiconductors at resolutions smaller than a micrometer. <b>This</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> limited by high costs, slow performance, the need to operate the beam in the vacuum and the tendency of the electrons to scatter in solids. The last problem limits the resolution to about 10nm. For this reason, EBL is primarily used {{for the production of}} small numbers of specialized integrated circuits.|$|E

5|$|For pilots, {{knowledge}} of the sky cover helps determine if visual flight rules (VFR) are being met. Knowing the degree of cloud cover can help {{determine whether or not}} various weather fronts, such as cold fronts or warm fronts, have passed by a location. A nephanalysis, contouring areas that are cloudy with scalloped lines, can be performed to indicate a system's cloud and precipitation pattern. <b>This</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> rarely performed nowadays, due to the prevalence of satellite imagery worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Radiotherapy {{is often}} given {{together}} with chemotherapy, {{and may be}} used with curative intent in people with NSCLC who {{are not eligible for}} surgery. This form of high-intensity radiotherapy is called radical radiotherapy. A refinement of <b>this</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART), in which a high dose of radiotherapy is given in a short time period. Postoperative thoracic radiotherapy generally should not be used after curative intent surgery for NSCLC. Some people with mediastinal N2 lymph node involvement might benefit from post-operative radiotherapy.|$|E
5|$|The novelists of the {{dictator}} novel genre combined narrative strategies of both modern and postmodern writing. Postmodern techniques, constructed {{largely in the}} late 1960s and 1970s, included use of interior monologues, radically stream-of-consciousness narrative, fragmentation, varying narrative points of view, neologisms, innovative narrative strategies, and frequent lack of causality. Alejo Carpentier, a Boom writer and contributor to {{the dictator}} novel genre pioneered {{what came to be}} known as magical realism, although the use of <b>this</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> not necessarily a prerequisite of the dictator novel, as there are many that do not utilize magical realism.|$|E

5|$|Three {{of the six}} prion {{species have}} bills filled with lamellae, which act as filters to sift {{zooplankton}} from the water. Water is forced through the lamellae and small prey items are collected. <b>This</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> often {{used in conjunction with}} a method known as hydroplaning where the bird dips its bill beneath the surface and propels itself forward with wings and feet as if walking on the water.|$|E
5|$|Buffer {{solutions}} {{also play}} a key role in analytical chemistry. They are used whenever there is a need to fix the pH of a solution at a particular value. Compared with an aqueous solution, the pH of a buffer solution is relatively insensitive to the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base. The buffer capacity of a simple buffer solution is largest when pH=pKa. In acid–base extraction, the efficiency of extraction of a compound into an organic phase, such as an ether, can be optimised by adjusting the pH of the aqueous phase using an appropriate buffer. At the optimum pH, the concentration of the electrically neutral species is maximised; such a species is more soluble in organic solvents having a low dielectric constant than it is in water. <b>This</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> used for the purification of weak acids and bases.|$|E
5|$|Off California, sharks {{immobilize}} northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) {{with a large}} bite to the hindquarters (which is {{the main}} source of the seal's mobility) and wait for the seal to bleed to death. <b>This</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> especially used on adult male elephant seals, which are typically larger than the shark, ranging between , and are potentially dangerous adversaries. Most commonly though, juvenile elephant seals are the most frequently eaten at elephant seal colonies. Prey is normally attacked sub-surface. Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) are taken from the surface and dragged down until they stop struggling. They are then eaten near the bottom. California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are ambushed from below and struck mid-body before being dragged and eaten.|$|E

5|$|Paleontology {{seeks to}} map out how living things have changed through time. A {{substantial}} hurdle to this aim is the difficulty of working out how old fossils are. Beds that preserve fossils typically lack the radioactive elements needed for radiometric dating. <b>This</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> our only means of giving rocks greater than about 50 million years old an absolute age, and can be accurate to within 0.5% or better. Although radiometric dating requires very careful laboratory work, its basic principle is simple: the rates at which various radioactive elements decay are known, and so {{the ratio of the}} radioactive element to the element into which it decays shows how long ago the radioactive element was incorporated into the rock. Radioactive elements are common only in rocks with a volcanic origin, and so the only fossil-bearing rocks that can be dated radiometrically are a few volcanic ash layers.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, the {{autocorrelation}} function c(r) {{of the electron}} density (also known as the Patterson function) can be computed directly from the reflection intensities, without computing the phases. In principle, this {{could be used to}} determine the crystal structure directly; however, it is difficult to realize in practice. The {{autocorrelation function}} corresponds to the distribution of vectors between atoms in the crystal; thus, a crystal of N atoms in its unit cell may have N(N-1) peaks in its Patterson function. Given the inevitable errors in measuring the intensities, and the mathematical difficulties of reconstructing atomic positions from the interatomic vectors, <b>this</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> rarely used to solve structures, except for the simplest crystals.|$|E
5|$|Directed pseudoforests and endo{{function}}s are in {{some sense}} mathematically equivalent. Any function ƒ from a set X to itself (that is, an endomorphism of X) {{can be interpreted as}} defining a directed pseudoforest which has an edge from x to y whenever ƒ(x) = y. The resulting directed pseudoforest is maximal, and may include self-loops whenever some value x has ƒ(x) = x. Alternatively, omitting the self-loops produces a non-maximal pseudoforest. In the other direction, any maximal directed pseudoforest determines a function ƒ such that ƒ(x) is the target of the edge that goes out from x, and any non-maximal directed pseudoforest can be made maximal by adding self-loops and then converted into a function in the same way. For this reason, maximal directed pseudoforests are sometimes called functional graphs. Viewing a function as a functional graph provides a convenient language for describing properties that are not as easily described from the function-theoretic point of view; <b>this</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> especially applicable to problems involving iterated functions, which correspond to paths in functional graphs.|$|E

5|$|Literary scholar M. Keith Booker {{argues that}} Vargas Llosa perfects the {{technique}} of interlacing dialogues in his novel The Green House. By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates {{the illusion of a}} flashback. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places. <b>This</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> a staple of his repertoire, which he began using {{near the end of his}} first novel, The Time of the Hero. However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in The Green House the technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space. In contrast, Captain Pantoja and the Special Service employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts. This device is similar to both Virginia Woolf's mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's counterpoint technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches.|$|E
