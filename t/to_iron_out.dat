On 1 May 1975 the British Government announced the nationalisation of the industry and British Aerospace consumed all the nation's manufacturers.|$|E

Ralph and Devine returned, and Bennett had Eyen, who was to direct, begin workshopping Big Dreams, as the musical was now known. Joining the cast at this time were Ben Harney, Obba Babatunde, Cleavant Derricks, and twenty-year-old gospel singer Jennifer Holliday as Carter's replacement (after Carter accepted an offer from NBC to star in Gimme a Break). However, Holliday left the project during the workshopping phase, as she disliked the material and was upset that her character, Effie White, died at the conclusion of the first act.

25|$|On September 8, 2008, at 12 noon, WWAY, WECT, WSFX, WILM-LP and W51CW {{all turned}} off their analog signals, making Wilmington the first {{market in the}} nation to go digital-only as part of a test by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) <b>to</b> <b>iron</b> <b>out</b> {{transition}} and reception concerns before the nationwide shutoff. Wilmington was chosen as the test market because the area's digital channel positions will remain unchanged after the transition. As the area's official conduit of emergency information, WUNJ did not participate in the early analog switchoff, and kept their analog signal on until the national digital switchover date of June 12, 2009. W47CK did not participate due to its low-power status; FCC rules currently exempt low-powered stations from the 2009 analog shutdown.

40|$|Abstract. Network {{engineers}} {{use different}} tools {{to manage and}} con-trol networks. While different tools use overlapping datasets, the data exchange between tools never had much priority. The creation of light-paths, dedicated network circuits, created the need for both multi-layer and multi-domain monitoring tools. Interdomain communication is still largely done by e-mail, but {{with the creation of}} multi-domain lightpaths, this is no longer feasible. Both standards and tools are required for the exchange of monitoring information between network domains. This ar-ticle gives an overview of the current standards and tools that are under development. The Dutch supercomputing centre SARA is developing and deploying tools based on the network description language (NDL) and the network markup language (NML). The RDF-based NDL {{has proven to be a}} useful basis for an information model, although many architec-tural details still need <b>to</b> <b>ironed</b> <b>out</b> before the end-to-end monitoring of lightpaths can be fully automated. ...|$|R

500|$|Rohrer later {{transferred}} {{the themes of}} Deception onto a framework around corporate espionage and the blood diamond trade. Though not particularly concerned about blood diamonds, and wary of the game being perceived as a finger-wagging exercise, {{he felt that the}} setting would give an [...] "extra oomph to the game's seedy mechanics". Instead of being an overt protest against the blood diamond trade, the game would explore the psychology of the industry through its game mechanics, causing players to reflect after a game on their decisions made within it. Majesco greenlit this, and in July 2009, a publishing contract was signed. Rohrer began work on Diamond Trust of London as a pen and paper prototype <b>to</b> <b>iron</b> <b>out</b> the design before committing to code. By December, the game was in a fully playable state, lacking only the soundtrack and tutorial. Majesco, however, decided to back away from a physical cartridge release, and pushed instead for a DSiWare download version. Rohrer disagreed, believing that the smaller DSiWare market would limit the game's audience; Majesco, on the other hand, was not willing to invest in the manufacturing of cartridges without strong pre-order numbers. The company made the game available to GameStop to gauge pre-order interest, stating that 3,000pre-orders would be necessary for a cartridge release. [...] Diamond Trust generated only 23pre-orders, and in 2010, the Majesco agreement was terminated.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{statistical}} properties of an ensemble of weak gravitational waves interacting nonlinearly {{in a flat}} space-time. We show that the resonant three-wave interactions are absent and develop a theory for four-wave interactions in a reduced case of a diagonal metric tensor. In this limit, where only one type of gravitational waves are present, we derive the interaction Hamiltonian and consider the asymptotic regime of weak gravitational wave turbulence. Both direct and inverse cascades are found for the energy and the wave action respectively, and the corresponding wave spectra are derived. The inverse cascade {{is characterized by a}} finite-time propagation of the metric excitations - a process similar to an explosive non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation, which provides an efficient mechanism <b>to</b> <b>ironing</b> <b>out</b> small-scale inhomogeneities. The direct cascade leads to an accumulation of the radiation energy in the system. These processes might be important for understanding the early Universe where a background of weak nonlinear gravitational waves is expected. Comment: 6 page...|$|R

2500|$|The {{starting}} point for calculating life expectancy is the age-specific death rates of the population members.

He produced about [...] of bitumen in 1930, and shipped it by barge and rail to Edmonton. The bitumen from the mine had numerous uses, {{but most of}} it was used to waterproof roofs.
