5|$|Automatic {{closure of}} public schools which racially {{integrate}} — The legislation required that any school which integrated (voluntarily or not) must be immediately and automatically closed. However, <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> given the discretion to take over integrated school(s) and reopen the school(s) on a segregated basis rather than close the entire district. Integrated schools {{did not have to}} stay closed, however. A school district could petition the governor to take over one or more schools (or the entire district) that had closed and reopen them as segregated schools. Whether exercising his discretion or acting on a petition from the school district, <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> authorized to act only as an agent of the Assembly. <b>The</b> <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> also required to try to persuade the African American child to return to his or her racially segregated school, so that the schools could reopen on a segregated basis.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with this fall in approval rating, an initiative to recall <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>was</b> {{started for the}} first and only time ever in New Jersey history. The recall effort failed after gathering less than the required 1.2million signatures.|$|E

Christopher Harrison was the first lieutenant governor to serve as acting governor while Jonathan Jennings negotiated treaties far from the capital.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{table of}} congressional seats, other federal offices, and other governorships held by governors. All representatives and {{senators}} mentioned represented New Jersey.

5|$|During Grand Duke Gian Gastone's rule, <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>was</b> {{responsible}} for formal court audiences. Violante Beatrice, {{in collaboration with}} the Electress Anna Maria Luisa, attempted to withdraw Gian Gastone from the Ruspanti, his salacious entourage, by arranging banquets and public appearances. Gian Gastone, however, was immune to these approaches and spent the last eight years of his reign confined to bed, entertained by the myriad Ruspanti.|$|E

50|$|For elected {{single person}} executives, term limits of 2 terms {{were put into}} place in 1993. Since 1966, <b>the</b> Lieutenant <b>Governor</b> <b>is</b> elected with <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> on <b>the</b> same ticket. <b>The</b> Lieutenant <b>Governor</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> President of the Michigan Senate and acts as <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> when <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>is</b> unable to execute the office, {{including}} whenever <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> leaves <b>the</b> state. <b>The</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> principal executive officer {{with the power of}} veto, appointment, reorganize executive government, budget proposal and other powers.|$|R

5|$|Following Italy's September 1911 {{invasion}} of Libya, al-Qassam began collecting funds in Jableh {{for the joint}} Ottoman-Libyan resistance movement and composed a victory anthem. Jableh's district governor sought to gain control over the fundraiser and when locals nevertheless continued to send their donations to al-Qassam, he attempted to have him jailed. The district governor alleged that al-Qassam was working against the Ottoman state, but an official investigation found him not guilty and <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> consequently dismissed.|$|E
5|$|His knighthood {{involved}} some controversy, {{following his}} wife's public comment {{that he was}} the only Australian state governor without such an honour. As knighthoods were then conferred by the Queen on the recommendation of her Federal and State governments, and <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>was</b> the Queen's representative in the state, this was seen as highly inappropriate, especially given the Western Australian ALP State government of the day, led by John Tonkin had a policy of not recommending Imperial Honours. However, the Tonkin Government was defeated in April 1974 and the incoming Liberal Premier, Sir Charles Court, was happy to make the necessary recommendation.|$|E
5|$|In June 1849 the {{governor}} of Sohar made a treaty with the British resident to suppress the slave trade. This triggered a revolt by the religious party in which <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> killed and his father, Hamad, was made governor. The Sultan of Oman, then residing in Zanzibar, arranged for Hamad to be seized and thrown in jail in Fort al Jalali. Hamad died on 23 April 1850, either from starvation or from poison.|$|E

5|$|The Whigs also {{maintained}} {{control of}} the General Assembly, and although Governor Powell was largely able to cooperate with his political opponents, some clashes did occur. As {{a result of the}} 1850 census, the General Assembly re-apportioned the state into ten congressional districts. Powell vetoed the redistricting, noting that the districts had been gerrymandered to give the fading Whig party control over the state delegation. The legislature overrode the veto. <b>The</b> <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> successful, however, in vetoing legislation that he felt would have created an overabundance of banks in the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|Fifty-six {{individuals}} {{have served as}} governor, four of whom served non-consecutive terms, totaling 60 distinct terms; the official numbering only lists each governor once, so there have officially been fifty-six governors. This numbering includes one acting governor: the lieutenant governor who filled the vacancy after {{the resignation of the}} governor, under the 1777 State Constitution. The list does not include people who have acted as governor when <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> out of state, such as Lt. Gov. Timothy L. Woodruff during Theodore Roosevelt's vice presidential campaign in 1900, or Acting Speaker of the New York State Assembly Moses M. Weinstein, who acted as governor for ten days in 1968 while the governor, the lieutenant governor, and the senate majority leader were out of the state, attending the Republican National Convention in Miami, Florida.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, the Simon Commission {{which was}} {{appointed}} {{to report on the}} working of the progress of the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms landed in India. The Swarajya Party moved a resolution to boycott the Commission and this was passed 61 to 50 with 12 remaining neutral. The Justice Party and the Swarajists supported the resolution while the Chief Minister P. Subbarayan opposed it and requested his ministers to resign. However, Lord Goschen, <b>the</b> <b>Governor,</b> <b>was</b> able to obtain the support of the Raja of Panagal by making a Justice Party member, M. Krishnan Nair, a Cabinet minister. Led by the Raja of Panagal, the Justice Party switched sides and lent its support to the Subbarayan government. Soon afterwards, the Justice Party passed a resolution welcoming the Simon Commission. The Simon Commission visited Madras on 28 February 1928 and 18 February 1929 and was boycotted by the Swarajya Party and the Indian National Congress. However, the Justicites and the Subbarayan Government accorded the Commission a warm reception.|$|E
50|$|As in all states, a popularly elected {{governor}} heads Maryland's executive branch. <b>The</b> <b>governor's</b> cabinet <b>is</b> {{known as the}} Executive Council.

5|$|Later, Owsley's tenure {{would be}} marred by a {{conflict}} with Benjamin Hardin, his Secretary of State. Hardin believed that by supporting Owsley in the gubernatorial election, he would obtain some influence in Owsley's choices for other appointments. Tensions between Hardin and Owsley worsened as Hardin became increasingly frustrated with his lack of influence. On September 1, 1846, Owsley removed Hardin from his cabinet, charging that Hardin had abandoned his duties {{because he did not}} reside in Frankfort. Hardin challenged this premise for his removal, and when Owsley nominated George B. Kinkead to replace Hardin, the state senate voted 30—8 that no vacancy existed. The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld this decision. Vindicated, Hardin then resigned, charging Owsley with practicing nepotism. In the Kentucky Constitution of 1850, <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> stripped of his power to remove the Secretary of State from office.|$|E
5|$|On March 7, 2016, Bevin {{released}} a video {{on social media}} claiming that House Democrats were not following through on their obligations to help craft the state budget. Legislators responded with a photo and statements that while Bevin was producing his film designed to chastise them, House leaders were in fact in committee meetings working out details of a budget proposal while Speaker Stumbo suggested <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>was</b> either unfamiliar with the legislative process, or intended to deceive people. On March 12, House Democrats released their own budget, which sustained most of the cuts to executive agencies in Bevin's budget, but exempted public universities from any cuts. The Republican-controlled Senate countered with a proposal that hewed closely to Bevin's original budget.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2010, {{unlike most}} other states, New Jersey {{did not have}} the office of {{lieutenant}} governor. Until 2010, when the office of governor was vacant or <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> unable to fulfill his/her duties through injury, the President of the State Senate served as the acting governor. The Senate President continued in the legislative role during his/her tenure as the state's acting chief executive, thus giving the person control over executive and legislative authority. The acting governor served either until the next general election, until the governor recovered from his/her injuries, or, if the governor died or resigned less than 16 months before end of the term, {{until the end of the}} term. Richard Codey served as acting governor of New Jersey until January 2006, following the resignation of Jim McGreevey in late 2004. Following the resignation of Christine Todd Whitman in 2001 to become EPA Administrator, Donald DiFrancesco assumed the acting governor's post. The position of lieutenant governor was created in the 2005 state election effective with the 2009 election.|$|E

5|$|Ross {{became the}} 19th {{governor}} of Texas. His inauguration ball {{was held at}} the newly opened Driskill Hotel, a tradition followed by every subsequent Texas governor. Under the 1876 Texas Constitution, which he had helped write, <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> granted the power to be commander-in-chief, to convene the legislature, to act as executor of the laws, to direct trade with other states, to grant pardons, and to veto bills. His campaign had focused on land use reform, as most of the frontier issues now resulted from disagreements over the use of public land, especially between farmers and ranchers concerned with water rights and grazing issues. At Ross's urging, the legislature passed laws to restore the power of the Land Office Commissioner, provide punishments for those using state lands illegally, and to catalog existing public lands.|$|E
5|$|The first Governor of the Territory was William Henry Harrison. Harrison County {{was named}} in his honor; he gained {{national}} fame during his term {{as a hero}} of the Battle of Tippecanoe. He later became the ninth President of the United States. Harrison served as governor from May 13, 1800 to December 28, 1812. Harrison did not arrive in the territory to begin governing until January 1801. John Gibson, the Territorial Secretary, served as acting governor, from {{the creation of the}} territory until his arrival. <b>The</b> <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> assisted in governing the territory by a three-member panel of judges, the General Court. The court served as both the highest legislative and judicial authority in the territory and its members were appointed by the governor.|$|E
5|$|The first New Jersey State Constitution, {{ratified}} in 1776, {{provided that}} a governor be elected annually {{by the state}} legislature, the members of which were selected by the several counties. Under this constitution, <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> president of the upper house of the legislature, then called the Legislative Council. The 1844 constitution provided for a popular vote to elect the governor, who no longer presided over the upper house of the legislature, now called the Senate. The 1844 constitution also lengthened the governor's term to three years, set to start on the third Tuesday in January following an election, and barred governors from succeeding themselves. The 1947 constitution extended terms to four years, and limits governors from being elected to more than two consecutive terms, though they can run again after a third term has passed.|$|E
