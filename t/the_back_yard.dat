5|$|It was {{possible}} to look into <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yard</b> from the road...the corpses in British uniform were lying in the yard near the buildings. They were lying in such a position that one can assume they were killed by machine-gun bursts. It struck me at once that the dead soldiers were not wearing helmets, nor did they have any equipment on them...I took pictures of the dead bodies, and the whole farm. At Thum's request these were to be placed {{at the disposal of}} the division...I believe I was already sitting there in the vehicle when Thum...told me that in the field which he had returned the equipment...the shot British soldiers were lying in a heap, from which he had {{come to the conclusion that}} a summary trial had taken place.|$|E

During the going-away party held for Bette and Tina, who are planning on moving to New York, they watch the film and Jenny is found dead in the swimming pool in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yard.</b> It is assumed that she either fell or was pushed from the landing above the back steps, which is unfinished and lacks a proper railing. Because {{so many people have}} been offended, betrayed and hurt by Jenny, there are many suspects and they are interrogated.|$|E
5|$|That night, Lisa prays to God and assures him she has {{not turned}} her back on him, but plans to seek a new path to him. While on a walk around town passing many sacrilegious signs, she finds Springfield's Buddhist temple. Inside she sees Lenny and Carl meditating, and Hollywood actor Richard Gere teaches the core {{concepts}} of Buddhism to her. An intrigued Lisa takes a pamphlet on Buddhism and studies it at home. It convinces her of the virtues of the faith, and Lisa announces out her window she has become, and forever will be, a Buddhist. Lisa plants her own bodhi tree in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yard</b> and begins to meditate, but Marge grows increasingly worried about Lisa's soul and tries to convince her to come back to Christianity.|$|E

5|$|The {{mutilated}} body of {{the fourth}} woman, prostitute Annie Chapman, was discovered at about 6:00am on Saturday 8 September on the ground near a doorway in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yard</b> of 29 Hanbury Street, Spitalfields. Chapman had left her lodgings at 2am {{on the day she}} was murdered, with the intention of getting money from a client to pay her rent. Her throat was cut from left to right. She had been disembowelled, and her intestines had been thrown out of her abdomen over each of her shoulders. The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing. The pathologist, George Bagster Phillips, was of the opinion that the murderer must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out the reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6–8inches (15–20cm) long. However, the idea that the murderer possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts. As the bodies were not examined extensively at the scene, it has also been suggested that the organs were actually removed by mortuary staff, who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they could sell as surgical specimens.|$|E

As the road approaches Hashamomuck Pond, it replaces Sound View Avenue as the northernmost road on the North Fork.

Between Hashamomuck Pond and Greenport West, a section of Middle Road near a motel with the Long Island Sound in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yard</b> is still paved with concrete, as it was commonly done during the mid-20th century. The section of old-fashioned pavement, however, is short-lived.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scenes were}} {{shot in a}} three-story single-family house located at 671 Lincoln Avenue {{in the village of}} Winnetka. The kitchen in the film was shot in the house, along with the main staircase, basement, attic and most of the first floor landing. The house's dining room, and all the downstairs rooms (excluding the kitchen) were {{duplicated}} on a sound stage to allow more room for equipment and crew. The house was built in 1920 and features five bedrooms, a fully converted attic, a detached double garage and a greenhouse. The tree house in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yard</b> was built specifically for the film and dismantled after filming ended.|$|E

I could make out fish and meat bones, garbage, pestilential rags, old boots, broken earthenware, and all the general refuse of a human sty.|$|R

25|$|After the Nazi German {{occupation}} of France in 1940, Beckett joined the French Resistance, {{in which he}} worked as a courier. On several occasions {{over the next two years}} he was nearly caught by the Gestapo. In August 1942, his unit was betrayed and he and Suzanne fled south on foot to the safety of the small village of Roussillon, in the Vaucluse département in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. There he continued to assist the Resistance by storing armaments in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yard</b> of his home. During the two years that Beckett stayed in Roussillon he indirectly helped the Maquis sabotage the German army in the Vaucluse mountains, though he rarely spoke about his wartime work in later life.|$|E

Eventually Grim Reaper attacks their house and nearly kills Viv. Virginia claims that the Reaper escaped, but The Vision eventually finds his remains buried in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yard.</b> He lies to the police and covers for her when asked about her whereabouts during the murder of neighbors, who tried to blackmail Virginia for the murder, but was accidentally killed by her. Instead of confronting her, he creates a sythezoid dog for the family, in an attempt to return to normalcy, but unbeknownst to him Agatha Harkness has a vision of the future and tries to warn the Avengers that The Vision and his family will cause a genocide.|$|E
25|$|Existing {{in a kind}} of Neverland where money {{never came}} in, schemes never stayed out for very long, yet no one living or visiting went wanting, 79 Wistful Vista (the McGees' address from show #20, August 1935 onward) became the home Depression-exhausted Americans visited to remind {{themselves}} that they were not the only ones finding cheer in the middle of struggle and doing their best not to make it overt. The McGees won their house in a raffle from Mr. Hagglemeyer's Wistful Vista Development Company, with lottery ticket #131,313, happened upon by chance while on a pleasure drive in their car. With blowhard McGee wavering between mundane tasks and hare-brained schemes (like digging an oil well in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yard),</b> antagonizing as many people as possible, and patient Molly indulging his foibles and providing loving support, not to mention a tireless parade of neighbors and friends {{in and out of the}} quiet home, Fibber McGee and Molly built its audience steadily, but once it found the full volume of that audience in 1940, they rarely let go of it.|$|E

25|$|The madbaha, {{arranged}} in the topmost platform {{at the eastern}} side of the building, represents Heaven. The primary altar is attached to the eastern wall. To the north of the madbaha is the diaqonikon (sacristry); to the south is the baptistery. The madbaha is protected with rails and is veiled by a red curtain most of the time; this is opened during the Holy Qurbana (Eucharist). An oil lamp within the sanctuary is kept glowing at all times to represent the presence of God. The madbaha is connected to the qestroma and haykla by a low-walled path called the sqaqona. The qestroma contains seats for the choir and lower clergy. The haykla contains an elevated platform or bema, which includes an altar, two lecterns for reading, and chairs for higher clergy. Worshipers stand before the altar, with separate seating for men and women. The main entrance is on the western side of the building; a vestibule, pillars, pilasters, and other architectural ornaments adorn the front end, and a flag mast stands in the front yard. One or two bells are installed in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yard</b> to signal the timing of ritual services, the death of a church member, or to inform the public of calamities.|$|E

[...] Aguilar's testimony was corroborated by Romero Diaz, who stated that Aguilar did not have a gun. [...] Judge Charles P.

500|$|The Bolton {{arm of the}} Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal was one of Dibnah's regular haunts. The canal was by then largely disused (the Bolton arm {{had been}} mostly closed in 1924) and Dibnah {{sometimes}} dredged it with an iron hook on a rope, {{for what he called}} 'plunder'. [...] Much of this was stored in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yard</b> of his mother's house. Dibnah and his friend Alan Heap built a canoe from old bicycle wheels (cut in half to make the ribs), slate laths and a canvas sheet from the back of a lorry. Much to the consternation of his mother, Dibnah sailed the boat along the nearby River Croal. [...] He once astonished his teachers when, following the theft of the school keys, he cut new keys for each classroom door.|$|E
