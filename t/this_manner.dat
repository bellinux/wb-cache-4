5|$|A 2007 report {{described}} pathologies in {{the bones}} of Majungasaurus. Scientists examined the remains of at least 21 individuals and discovered four with noticeable pathologies. While pathology had been studied in large tetanuran theropods like allosaurids and tyrannosaurids, {{this was the first}} time an abelisauroid had been examined in <b>this</b> <b>manner.</b> No wounds were found on any skull elements, in contrast to tyrannosaurids where sometimes gruesome facial bites were common. One of the specimens was a phalanx (toe bone) of the foot, which had apparently been broken and subsequently healed.|$|E

5|$|Considering {{the weight}} of attack against airfields, hardly any fighters were {{destroyed}} on the ground. Figures indicated just two Spitfires and six Hurricanes were lost in <b>this</b> <b>manner.</b> The main reason for this was the high state of readiness of RAF units during daylight. The command depended on radar and the Observer Corps warning them in advance, giving them {{plenty of time to}} get airborne. The successful strafing attack by Bf 109s of JG 52 on Manston depended on a combination of circumstances and chance which did not occur often during the battle.|$|E
5|$|De Saulles {{created the}} new florin in <b>this</b> <b>manner</b> to {{distinguish}} the coin from the half crown, as there had been complaints of confusion. He probably based the design on his British trade dollar (1895). The sitter for the design was Susan Hicks-Beach, the daughter of Michael Hicks-Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn who had served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and ex officio Master of the Mint. The modern-day Britannia coinage, bullion pieces struck by the Royal Mint for investors and collectors, has a reverse that strongly resembles that of the Edwardian florin.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Who is {{not unique}} in its losses, as many {{broadcasters}} regularly cleared their archives in <b>this</b> <b>manner.</b> Until the BBC changed its archiving policy in 1978, thousands of hours of programming, in all genres, were deleted. Other affected BBC series include Dad's Army, Z-Cars, The Wednesday Play, Steptoe and Son, and Not Only... But Also. ITV regional franchises also deleted many programmes, including early videotaped episodes of The Avengers.|$|E

5|$|Enoch Sontonga {{worked in}} a Methodist mission school near Johannesburg. Sontonga, like Parry, was a choirmaster; in 1897, he set new words to Parry's music and called the hymn Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika. Welsh missionaries often brought various copies of hymnals to their African missions; it is {{believed}} Parry's hymn reached Africa in <b>this</b> <b>manner.</b> While Sontonga wrote only one stanza of lyrics and a chorus for the song, Samuel Mqhayi composed seven more stanzas in 1927. The song became the national anthem of South Africa and four other African nations.|$|E
5|$|Following {{this the}} 27th Battalion {{returned}} to Egypt, where the AIF undertook {{a period of}} training and re-organisation as reinforcements arrived from Australia. During this time the AIF was expanded from two infantry divisions to four– with a fifth forming in Australia– and many infantry battalions that had seen service at Gallipoli were split up to provide cadre staff for the newly raised battalions. The battalions of the 2nd Division, however, were not split up in <b>this</b> <b>manner</b> and the 27th Battalion remained intact.|$|E
5|$|Forest covers about 12.6% of the country, {{most of it}} {{designated}} for commercial production. Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates. Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island, in particular in the Killarney National Park. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in <b>this</b> <b>manner</b> {{is one of the}} main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, {{evidence}} of tumors, including hemangiomas, desmoplastic fibroma, metastatic cancer, and osteoblastoma, {{was described in}} Edmontosaurus bones. Rothschild et al. tested dinosaur vertebrae for tumors using computerized tomography and fluoroscope screening. Several other hadrosaurids, including Brachylophosaurus, Gilmoreosaurus, and Bactrosaurus, also tested positive. Although more than 10,000fossils were examined in <b>this</b> <b>manner,</b> the tumors were limited to Edmontosaurus and closely related genera. The tumors may {{have been caused by}} environmental factors or genetic propensity.|$|E
5|$|In {{a school}} of Pacific blue-eyes that is threatened, a few {{individuals}} accelerate and change direction, which initiates an escape wave that spreads through the whole cohort. Animals are known to dart in random directions and speeds as an escape response when threatened. Pacific blue-eyes on their own dart in <b>this</b> <b>manner</b> for up to ten seconds after being faced with a threat at close range. This period is briefer when faced with more distant threats or for fish in schools.|$|E
5|$|In <b>this</b> <b>manner,</b> the Emperor's modern role {{is often}} {{compared}} {{to those of the}} Shogunate period and much of Japan's history, whereby the Emperor held great symbolic authority but had little political power; which is often held by others nominally appointed by the Emperor himself. Today, a legacy has somewhat continued for a retired Prime Minister who still wields considerable power, to be called a Shadow Shogun (闇将軍).|$|E

Microsoft said that the loophole {{is not intended to}} be used in <b>this</b> <b>manner.</b> In November 2017, Microsoft stated that this program would end December 31, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species of}} the Hydrophiinae are able to respire through {{the top of their}} skin. This is unusual for reptiles, because their skin is thick and scaly, but {{experiments}} with the black-and-yellow sea snake, Pelamis platura (a pelagic species), have shown this species can satisfy about 25% of its oxygen requirements in <b>this</b> <b>manner,</b> which allows for prolonged dives.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 1917, Kaiser Wilhelm II {{personally}} {{approved a}} resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare {{in order to}} try to force the British to make peace.

5|$|Over time, Marshall came {{to believe}} that Eichelberger's talents were wasted at West Point, but he was opposed by Pa Watson, who wanted Eichelberger to remain at West Point. When Marshall told Watson that Eichelberger's chances for {{promotion}} to major general were being adversely affected by being denied the chance to command a division, Watson added Eichelberger's name {{to the top of a}} promotion list and had the President sign it. In <b>this</b> <b>manner,</b> Eichelberger was promoted to major general in July 1941.|$|E
5|$|Scales, more specifically, mostly {{consist of}} hard beta keratins which are {{basically}} transparent. The colours {{of the scale}} are due to pigments in the inner layers of the skin and not due to the scale material itself. Scales are hued for all colours in <b>this</b> <b>manner</b> except for blue and green. Blue {{is caused by the}} ultrastructure of the scales. By itself, such a scale surface diffracts light and gives a blue hue, while, in combination with yellow from the inner skin it gives a beautiful iridescent green.|$|E
5|$|The County Divisions, {{including}} the Devon and Cornwall County Division, were around 10,000 men strong and assigned {{to defend the}} coastlines of threatened sections of the country, {{including the}} manning of coastal artillery. These divisions were largely static, lacking mobility and also divisional assets such as artillery, engineers, and reconnaissance forces. Using the recruits in <b>this</b> <b>manner</b> allowed the regular infantry divisions to be freed up from such duties, undertake training, and form an all-important reserve {{that could be used}} to counterattack any possible German landing.|$|E
