5000|$|In the present, Blackthorn, distressed, tracks <b>the</b> <b>Spaniard</b> into <b>the</b> Andes, {{with the}} Bolivian army not far behind.

60|$|The {{first of}} which schemes failed; for <b>the</b> <b>Spaniard</b> was as abstemious as any monk, and drank little but water; the second succeeded not over well, for <b>the</b> <b>Spaniard</b> was as cunning as any fox, and {{answered}} little but wind.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Spaniards</b> {{had assumed}} the {{approaching}} vessels {{were part of}} their convoy, but by daybreak they had realised their error and vainly set more sail to escape. Being close enough to hail the Spanish crews, Duckworth ordered that they surrender. When <b>the</b> <b>Spaniards</b> ignored the demand, he ordered Leviathan and Emerald to open fire on the rigging of the Spanish vessels in order to disable them. Both Spanish frigates quickly surrendered. Carmen had had 11 men killed and 16 wounded; Florentina 12 killed and 10 wounded, including her first and second captains. The two Spanish frigates were each carrying 1500 quintals of mercury.|$|E

5|$|After Cuba was taken, President William McKinley {{approved}} the land invasion of Puerto Rico {{by way of}} Fajardo, taking into consideration that <b>the</b> <b>Spaniards</b> had fortified San Juan, where they expected the initial attack.

6000|$|... "For Heaven's sake, no!" [...] said Amyas, looking {{somewhat}} blank, nevertheless, for he much doubted {{whether the}} whole {{was not a}} ruse {{on the part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Spaniard,</b> and he knew how impossible it was for his fifteen stone of flesh to give chase to <b>the</b> <b>Spaniard's</b> twelve. But he was soon reassured; <b>the</b> <b>Spaniard</b> wheeled round towards him, and began to put the rough hackney through all the paces of the manege with a grace and skill which won applause from the beholders.|$|R

5|$|Apaches shunned the mission, and on March 16, 1758, {{a band of}} Comanche, Tonkawa, and Hasinai tribes, {{angry that}} <b>the</b> <b>Spaniards</b> were {{assisting}} their enemies, pillaged and burned the mission, killing eight people. The San Sabá mission was the only Spanish mission in Texas to be completely destroyed by Indians, and it was never rebuilt.

On November 3, 1536, the Spanish Crown confirmed the founding and, on December 7, 1537, emperor Charles V granted a coat of arms to the city.|$|E
5|$|Nobody {{could call}} {{the whole nation}} a criminal, nor the {{individuals}} that have aired their political views. If the right of conquest belongs by right to the conquering country, {{it would be fair}} for Spain to quit resisting the French and submit to them, by the same principles for which it is expected that the Americans submit themselves to the peoples of Pontevedra. The reason and the rule must be equal for everybody. Here there are no conquerors or conquered; here there are only Spaniards. <b>The</b> <b>Spaniards</b> of Spain have lost their land. <b>The</b> <b>Spaniards</b> of America are trying to save theirs. Let the ones from Spain deal with themselves as they can; do not worry, we American Spaniards know what we want and where we go. So I suggest we vote: that we replace the Viceroy with a new authority that will be subject to the parent state if it is saved from the French, and independent if Spain is finally subjugated.|$|E

They set out across the Uyuni salt flats, hoping to reach the coast where Blackthorn can find a boat to take him home. Halfway across, the posse catches up to them, but Blackthorn and <b>the</b> <b>Spaniard</b> split up {{and are able to}} kill their pursuers and escape.|$|R

Heureux sailed up as fast as she could but even before she arrived <b>the</b> <b>Spaniard</b> had struck to Guachapin. The two-hour engagement had cost Guachapin two men killed and three wounded, and <b>the</b> <b>Spaniard</b> nearly <b>the</b> same. <b>The</b> <b>Spaniard</b> was <b>the</b> Theresa, under the command of an officer of the Spanish Navy, and had a crew of 120 men.|$|R

5|$|Not only {{is there}} no reason {{to get rid of}} the Viceroy, but even if no part of Spain {{remained}} unsubdued, <b>the</b> <b>Spaniards</b> in America ought to take it back and resume command over it. America should only be ruled by the natives when there is no longer a Spaniard there. If even a single member of the Central Junta of Seville were to land on our shores, we should receive him as the Sovereign.|$|E

5|$|Sailing {{south toward}} {{the island of}} Mindanao, López de Legazpi's fleet {{encountered}} highwinds forcing them to sail northward to the island of Bohol. There, he captured a vessel from Borneo whose Malay sailors informed <b>the</b> <b>Spaniards</b> that the natives inhabiting the region traded with people from Borneo and Indonesia. Arriving in Bohol, López de Legazpi noticed the hostility of the people. The Malayan servant explained that such hostility {{was due to the}} expeditions conducted by the Portuguese from the Moluccas islands. In 1563, Portuguese fleets arrived in Visayan waters and enslaved about 1,000 inhabitants. López de Legazpi, {{with the help of the}} Malayan sailor, explained to the tribes in Bohol that they were not Portuguese and that they had come to the islands to trade. Upon learning this, the chieftains and their tribes became friendlier and welcoming to <b>the</b> <b>Spaniards.</b>|$|E

The joy and gratitude of <b>the</b> <b>Spaniard</b> were too deep for words, and he uttered his thanks in broken tones. When they had walked about a mile Geoffrey halted.|$|R

5|$|After the Taino victory {{the colonists}} formed a citizens' militia to defend {{themselves}} against the attacks. Juan Ponce de León {{and one of his}} top commanders, Diego de Salazar led <b>the</b> <b>Spaniards</b> in a series of offensives which included a massacre of the Taino forces in the domain of Agüeybaná II. The Spanish offensive culminated in the Battle of Yagüecas against Cacique Mabodomoca. Agüeybaná II was shot and killed, ending the first recorded military action in Puerto Rico. After the failed rebellion, the Tainos were forced to give up their customs and traditions by order of a Royal decree, approved by King Ferdinand II, which required that they adopt and practice the values, religion and language of their conquerors.|$|E
5|$|From January until March 1686, La Salle {{and most}} of his men searched {{overland}} for the Mississippi River, traveling towards the Rio Grande, possibly as far west as modern-day Langtry, Texas.

When the group returned, they were unable to find the Belle where they had left her and were forced to walk back to the fort.|$|E
