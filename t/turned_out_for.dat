5|$|Ford was a keen cricketer from {{an early}} age and would often turn out for a team {{representing}} Aston Villa against local sides. In 1955, he <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> Glamorgan Cricket Club in a charity benefit match for Allan Watkins against Abergavenny Cricket Club, playing alongside players such as Gilbert Parkhouse, Jim Pressdee and Harold Gimblett. His Wales international teammates Billy Lucas and Alf Sherwood were also due to play in the match.|$|E
5|$|On October 15, 1983, about 10,000 demonstrators <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> protest at the Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant (well {{short of}} the 21,000 hoped for by protest organizers). No arrests were made. On August 10, 1987 (the 42nd anniversary of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki), 320 demonstrators were arrested after they tried to force a one-day {{shutdown}} of the plant. A similar protest with a turnout of about 3,500 was staged on August 6, 1989 (the anniversary of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima).|$|E

5|$|The {{record for}} the most {{appearances}} for Luton is held by Bob Morton, who <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> Luton 562 times in all competitions. Morton also holds the {{record for the}} most Football League appearances for the club, with 495. Fred Hawkes holds {{the record for the}} most league appearances for Luton, having played in 509 league matches. Six players, Gordon Turner, Andy Rennie, Brian Stein, Ernie Simms, Herbert Moody and Steve Howard, have scored more than 100 goals for Luton.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} to Australia, Macartney {{continued}} to play club cricket and <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a final first-class summer. At {{the start of the}} 1926–27 season, he captained a combined Sydney City team against a New South Wales country team, which included the then 18-year-old Bradman. Macartney scored 126 and Bradman 98 in a match viewed as a generational transition in Australian batting. He scored 114 in his opening first-class match of the season, and took wickets in each of his four matches. Macartney totalled 243 runs at 40.50 and took 11 wickets at 17.82.|$|E
5|$|He played {{three of}} England four {{qualification}} {{games for the}} 1958 FIFA World Cup: a 5–1 victory over the Republic of Ireland, and the 5–2 and 4–1 wins over Denmark. On 15 May 1957, Matthews became the oldest player ever to represent England, when at 42 years and 104 days old he <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the victory over the Danes in Copenhagen. Despite calls by the press {{for him to be}} included in the 1958 World Cup squad, this time the selectors did not bow to the pressure. Yet at 23 years, nobody would ever enjoy a longer career with the England team.|$|E

5|$|However intense running {{sessions}} ran by coach Mick Lyons {{took their}} toll on his right knee, and on 20 September 1990 he took a knock in a practice match, which required him to have yet another operation on his right knee. After the return of Howard Kendall as manager in November 1990, Whiteside managed to appear in a few reserve team games, but this only delayed the inevitable, and {{he was forced to}} retire from the game at the age of 26 in June 1991. He had a testimonial game between Manchester United and Everton at Old Trafford in May 1992, but as United lost the title the previous week, only 7,434 <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the occasion.|$|E
5|$|Just a {{week after}} {{defeating}} Williams, a rematch was announced between Dyer and Holland. The fight venue was Rushcutters Bay Stadium in Sydney and both fighters <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a training exhibition in the build-up to the contest. The contest, held on 5 June 1915, was watched by a crowd of 2,000 spectators. The fight went the full distance and in the closing rounds Holland, realising that his only chance of victory was a knockout, attacked Dyer ferociously, staggering the Welshman in the 19th. Despite the late assault, Dyer stayed on his feet and was announced the winner by the referee.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to Wales, Beadles played for his local side Newtown during the 1919–20 season, winning the Montgomeryshire & District Football League. The {{following}} year, he moved to Merseyside, where he <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> amateur team Graysons of Garston of the West Cheshire Association Football League, an amateur side that represented a local shipping company, whilst also working for the company. Beadles often commented on his role at the company to family members, believing he was only employed due to his footballing skills as he would spend most working days making tea. In June 1921, he signed for Liverpool, {{one of the leading}} teams in the country at the time, along with teammate Danny Shone.|$|E

5|$|Biggs {{played for}} several club teams {{throughout}} his career, including England's Richmond and Welsh exile club London Welsh. On 24 December 1890, Biggs played for London Welsh in a match against his longterm club Cardiff. The London Welsh team produced a 'devastating display' to beat Cardiff {{by a single}} try. At county level he represented Glamorgan where he played alongside his brother, and later <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> Somerset. During the 1893/94 season Biggs was made club captain of Cardiff, {{and in the same}} season he led Cardiff against the invitational team the Barbarians, not only winning the game but also scoring two tries and kicking a successful conversion. The same season as he faced the Barbarians with Cardiff, Biggs was invited to join the tourists; one of four of the Biggs brothers to play for the team. The last notable club Biggs represented was Bath, captaining the senior team during the 1899–1900 season.|$|E
5|$|He had a {{short and}} {{relatively}} unsuccessful playing career, spent mostly as a striker in non-league football. He <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> {{a wide variety of}} clubs, including: Gillingham, Barnet, Wycombe Wanderers, Kingstonian, Wealdstone, Farnborough Town, Harlow Town, Enfield, Aylesbury United, Harrow Borough, Tooting & Mitcham United, Molesey and Walton & Hersham. He started his managerial career at the age of 28, managing Kingstonian for five months, before spending a year in charge of Enfield. In 1999, Westley became manager of Farnborough Town, guiding them to the Football Conference in 2002. He left Farnborough the following season, to become manager of Stevenage. He took the club to within one game of promotion to the Football League, but left the club in 2006 when his contract expired. Westley then had a brief, but successful, spell with Rushden & Diamonds, as well as acting as caretaker manager at Kettering Town.|$|E
5|$|The NASL all-star teams {{selected}} by the league {{at the end of}} each season included a total of 18 Cosmos players. These include numerous well-known players from outside the United States, signed from European or South American clubs. Examples of these are erstwhile West Germany captain Franz Beckenbauer and the former Brazil international players Pelé and Carlos Alberto; there were many others. Among the American players representing the Cosmos were two players born in Yugoslavia: U.S. international defender Werner Roth and Siegfried Stritzl, a midfielder. Canada international John Kerr, originally from Scotland, also <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> New York during the early 1970s. Former Italy forward Giorgio Chinaglia holds many of the side's records pertaining to individual performance, appearing in the most matches, scoring the most goals and points, and sharing the record for most all-star appearances (six) with Vladislav Bogićević, a member of the Yugoslavia national team before his time with the Cosmos.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 2005–06 {{season he}} was sent on loan to League One side Barnsley where he stayed for three months. Barnsley won {{promotion}} to the Championship although Nix did not play in any games. He returned to Sheffield United but he was among seven players to be released by manager Neil Warnock. Nix had an unsuccessful trial at Peterborough United, and one at Grimsby Town which was curtailed by an ankle ligament injury, and played a reserve team outing for Rotherham United. But after failing to win a place at any of the three league teams, he turned to non-league football. He first appeared for Northern Premier League side Buxton, making his debut against Bridlington Town on 11 November 2006. He played seven times for Buxton, scoring one goal, which came in a 9–0 Derbyshire Senior Cup victory over Blackwell Miners Welfare. For the rest of the 2006–07 season he <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> Northern Counties East League side Parkgate. He also scored once for Parkgate—in a 4–3 Sheffield and Hallamshire Senior Cup semi-final defeat to Stocksbridge Park Steels.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, {{he moved}} to Second Division Grimsby Town. Though now playing in the {{professional}} Football League, Chapman was still an amateur at this stage and obtained {{a job with a}} firm of local solicitors to earn his way. Grimsby started the season poorly – they were {{near the bottom of the}} division by Christmas and were beaten 7–0 by Preston North End in the FA Cup, but rallied to finish tenth at the end of the 1898–99 season. By this time Chapman had been dropped from the team, having been unsuccessfully moved to centre forward, an unfamiliar position for him. He was released by Grimsby and drifted down into non-league football with a brief spell at Swindon Town, playing three games and scoring twice, but had to leave the club as he was unable to find a job in the area. He moved on to see out the season with Sheppey United, who finished bottom of the Southern League in 1899–1900. Chapman finished as United's top scorer but was injured at the end of this season, and still unable to find a job. Disheartened, he returned to his home town and <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> Worksop Town of the Midland League in 1900–01, while resuming his studies, this time at Old Firth College in Sheffield.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{resumed his}} {{first-class}} cricket career steadily against Queensland and South Australia. Lindwall gave his first indications of cricketing potential on a 38 degree {{day in the}} second innings of a match against Victoria. A day after suffering a mild malaria attack, Lindwall gave a spell of four overs which netted him three wickets, bowling at speeds not seen in Australia since Larwood. An innings of 134 not out in just 180 minutes against Queensland at the SCG underlined by cutting and driving exhibited his batting skill, and with a haul of 9/77 against South Australia further underlining his allround credential. Lindwall gained further attention when he <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> New South Wales against the feted Australian Services team of Lindsay Hassett that had played in the 1945 Victory Tests in England. Lindwall's hostile bowling delivered three wickets in each innings, finishing with match figures of 6/95, leading Hassett to rate him as the best fast-bowling prospect in a decade. With 33 wickets for the season, Lindwall as selected for an Australian team tour of New Zealand under Bill Brown. He played in a Test against New Zealand, which was not awarded Test status until 1948. In a match in which Australia fielded seven Test debutants, Lindwall opened the bowling with state teammate Ernie Toshack. Lindwall had limited opportunities on a sticky wicket which favoured the slower bowling of O’Reilly and Toshack, who took eight and seven wickets respectively. He took 1/13 and 1/16 as Australia won by an innings and 103 runs. Lindwall made a duck in Australia's only innings.|$|E

5|$|Mercedes-Benz officially {{withdrew from}} motor racing in 1931—citing the global {{economic}} downturn {{as a reason for}} their decision—although they continued to support Caracciola and a few other drivers covertly, retaining manager Alfred Neubauer to run the 'independent' operation. In part because of the financial situation, Caracciola was the only Mercedes driver to appear at the 1931 Monaco Grand Prix, driving an SSKL (a shorter version of the SSK). Caracciola and Maserati driver Luigi Fagioli challenged the Bugattis of Louis Chiron and Achille Varzi for the lead early in the race, but when the SSKL's clutch failed Caracciola withdrew from the race. A crowd of 100,000 <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. Rain began to fall before the race, and continued as Caracciola chased Fagioli for the lead in the early laps. The spray from Fagioli's Maserati severely impaired Caracciola's vision, but he was able to pass to take the lead at the Schwalbenschwanz corner. The track began to dry on lap six, and Chiron's Bugatti, which was by then running second, began to catch the heavier Mercedes. Caracciola's pit stop, completed in record time, kept him ahead of Chiron, and despite the Bugatti lapping 15seconds faster than the Mercedes late in the race, Caracciola won by more than one minute.|$|E
