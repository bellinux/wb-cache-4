5|$|It is {{difficult}} for scholars <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> <b>the</b> exact form of the entertainments, but clues have been gleaned from the written accounts, scripts, artworks, and tapestries that derived from these famous occasions. Though such sources must be treated with caution, since they contain demonstrable inaccuracies and contradictions, they provide evidence of the richness and scale of Catherine de' Medici's court festivals.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the black}} boxes and {{communication}} transcripts were obtained, the investigators interviewed the ExcelAire's flight crew {{and the air}} traffic controllers, trying <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> <b>the</b> scenario which allowed two modern jet aircraft, equipped with the latest anti-collision gear, to collide with each other while on instrument flights in positive control airspace.|$|E
40|$|Most recent {{approaches}} to monocular non-rigid 3 D shape recovery rely on exploiting point correspondences and work best {{when the whole}} surface is well-textured. The alternative is to rely either on contours or shading information, which has only been demonstrated in very restrictive settings. Here, we propose a novel approach to monocular deformable shape recovery that can operate under complex lighting and handle partially textured surfaces. At {{the heart of our}} algorithm are a learned mapping from intensity patterns to the shape of local surface patches and a principled approach <b>to</b> <b>piecing</b> <b>together</b> <b>the</b> resulting local shape estimates. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively using both synthetic and real data...|$|R
40|$|Structural, {{molecular}} and biochemical {{approaches have}} contributed <b>to</b> <b>piecing</b> <b>together</b> <b>the</b> puzzle of how matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) work {{and contribute to}} various disease processes. However, MMPs have many unexpected substrates other than components of the extracellular matrix which profoundly influence cell behaviour, survival and death. With the current understanding of diverse/novel roles of matrix metalloproteinases-particularly their direct or indirect relevance for the early steps during programmed cell death-some seemingly contrasting results seem less surprising. To better target MMPs an appreciation of their many extracellular, intracellular and intranuclear functions, often acting in opposing directions with paradoxical roles in cell death, is carefully required.

5|$|After the {{introduction}} which shows parts of Cord's missions, the game {{starts with a}} scene in which Cord is interrogated by now premier Dmitri Nagarov, while he is being tortured by his assistant Lukyan. After the torture, Cord is fighting for his sanity, and all he knows for sure is that he was betrayed.

5|$|Deception {{and problem}} solving are central themes in this novel as both the thief and the central adult players {{use a variety of}} ways to hide the truth while the {{children}} employ a series of mathematical and problem-solving concepts <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> <b>the</b> clues to the puzzle. In addition, Calder and Petra develop a special friendship and certain respect for the value of art.|$|E
5|$|In October 1968, Crawford's 29-year-old daughter, Christina (who {{was then}} acting in New York on the CBS soap opera The Secret Storm), needed {{immediate}} medical attention for a ruptured ovarian tumor. Despite {{the fact that}} Christina's character was a 28-year-old and Crawford was in her sixties, Crawford offered to play her role until Christina was well enough to return, to which producer Gloria Monty readily agreed. Although Crawford did well in rehearsal, she lost her composure while taping and the director and producer were left to struggle <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> <b>the</b> necessary footage.|$|E
50|$|Single mother Ellie West (Helen Slater), who is {{struggling}} to cut-free a deadbeat ex-husband (Alan Thicke), finds love with surgeon Dr. Jesse Peter (Billy Zane), who she meets at the consult for upcoming out-patient surgery. Encouraged by her close friend Una (Kelly Le Brock) and supportive boss Sid (Harvey Korman), she proceeds quickly but then has an unusual reaction when she is put under in the operating room, much {{to the dismay of}} the lead anesthesiologist (Stuart Pankin). Post-surgery, Ellie begins to see strange signs indicating that she and her daughter Autumn (Heather Lind) may be in danger but she does not know why or of whom to be wary. Furthermore, Norman, a timid admirer (David L. Lander) may be <b>the</b> key <b>to</b> <b>piecing</b> <b>together</b> <b>the</b> bizarre alarms of danger going off all around Ellie.|$|R

5|$|The series {{depicts the}} adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life {{as a high school}} student while {{moonlighting}} as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica experiences persistent and vivid nightmares of the students who died in the bus crash, and she attempts <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> <b>the</b> clues she's gotten from these dreams. Meanwhile, Logan (Jason Dohring) and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) are forced to work together on a science experiment.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving employs {{non-linear}} storytelling, {{forcing the}} player <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> <b>the</b> narrative. During gameplay, objectives and guidance are provided through the player's interactions with objects. The player has {{little control over}} the game mechanics and is only able to move freely and pick up objects as needed to progress. Several optional actions, such as drinking alcohol, are available at several stages of the game.|$|E

They were always extremely tough <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> satisfaction of all the editors, art directors and assorted researchers who were assigned to such projects. But, it was extremely interesting work.|$|R
5|$|Reviewers felt {{part of the}} failings laid {{with the}} {{underdeveloped}} characters despite them being slightly different from usual anime stock characters. The story neither properly introduces them nor explains their backgrounds and motivations, making them hard to identify with. Eko's menace only came by force and not by his personality or schemes, making him a weak villain. DVD Talk found it hard <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> <b>the</b> relationship between the main characters, but acknowledged the later half addressed {{some of these issues}} by revealing the background of some characters. They felt the revelations fleshed out Otoha's personality and motivation, helping viewers to sympathize and identify with the protagonist.|$|E
5|$|For its fiftieth anniversary, Fantasia {{returned}} to 550 theaters nationwide on October 5, 1990, in its traditional 1946 version including the live action scenes with Taylor {{and the original}} Stokowski score. The film underwent a two-year restoration process which began after a six-month search <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> <b>the</b> original negatives {{that had been in}} storage since 1946. This marked the first time since then that a release of the film had been processed from the original and not from a copy. Each of its 535,680 frames were restored at YCM Laboratories, and an untouched print from 1951 was used for guidance on color and tone. Theaters were required to have specific stereo equipment installed, and to present the film in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio with black borders on the side of their screens. The Stokowski soundtrack was digitally remastered using the 1955 magnetic soundtrack, with an estimated three thousand pops and hisses being removed in the process. The 1990 reissue of Fantasia went on to gross $25 million domestically.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} episodes of CarnivÃ le, Ben's {{parentage}} {{is one of}} the big puzzles. As a man named Henry Scudder seems connected to everything and everyone, it is Ben's job <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> <b>the</b> mystery of his own past. The progressing series indicates many characters are more closely interrelated than what both the characters and the audience would imagine at first. Although these links rarely receive plot attention, the immediate genealogy of the main characters is cleared up {{by the end of the}} second season. Other character links that were largely unanswered after CarnivÃ les cancellation concern the trench war and the Hyde&Teller Company in relation to the emergence of the CarnivÃ le. Show creator Daniel Knauf, character biographies on the HBO website and the Pitch Document later provided detail for what was originally envisioned. Although the nature of these sources does not qualify them for canon status, they provide a framework for hints dropped in the series.|$|E

Louis trained Mallory well, but there is still the possibility that following his trail will cause Mallory to make the same mistakes he did, and lead to her becoming another victim.|$|R
5|$|The German {{survivors}} {{were taken}} to Fremantle and interrogated. Attempts to learn what had happened were hampered by the German officers instructing their sailors to obfuscate the enemy with false answers, people describing events they did not witness but heard of later, and difficulty in keeping groups separated in order to check their stories against each other. Despite this, Australian authorities were able <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> <b>the</b> broad details of the battle, which was verified {{by a group of}} German sailors who had been taken to Sydney instead: their interviews showed the same commonalities and inconsistencies as those from Fremantle, and the interrogators concluded that the true story was being recounted. Interrogations were concluded in December, {{and by the end of}} January, Kormorans personnel had been moved to prisoner-of-war camps in Victoria, where they remained until their repatriation to Germany in early 1947.|$|E
5|$|Kerrigan {{returns in}} StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty (2010). At BlizzCon 2007, Chris Metzen {{explained}} {{that in the}} years after Brood War, Kerrigan relocated to Char, pulling back most of the Zerg, and has since been quiet. She has the power to wipe out all her enemies but has not, creating a tense state of peace in the sector. Metzen also indicated an interest in exploring if there was any humanity left in Kerrigan or if she is beyond redemption in her current state. He revealed that Kerrigan's withdrawal {{has little to do with}} any suspicion she has of Duran, who is revealed towards the end of Brood War to be conducting secret experiments on creating a Protoss/Zerg hybrid; she does not know much about him, but in the time after Brood War, she is beginning <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> <b>the</b> puzzle surrounding his motives. At BlizzCon 2008, Kerrigan made two brief appearances in cinematic trailers, one during an attack on a Terran city that was captured on video, and again in a series of caverns where Zeratul was studying ancient runes; in the latter, Kerrigan implies she has been waiting for his arrival.|$|E
