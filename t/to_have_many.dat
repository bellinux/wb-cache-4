5|$|Another Tyrannosaurus, nicknamed Stan, {{in honor}} of amateur {{paleontologist}} Stan Sacrison, {{was found in the}} Hell Creek Formation near Buffalo, South Dakota, in the spring of 1987. It was not collected until 1992, as it was mistakenly thought to be a Triceratops skeleton. Stan is 63% complete and is on display in the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in Hill City, South Dakota, after an extensive world tour during 1995 and 1996. This tyrannosaur, too, was found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> bone pathologies, including broken and healed ribs, a broken (and healed) neck and a spectacular hole in the back of its head, {{about the size of a}} Tyrannosaurus tooth.|$|E
5|$|The gods were {{believed}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> names. Among them were secret names that conveyed their true natures more profoundly than others. To know the true {{name of a}} deity was to have power over it. The importance of names is demonstrated by a myth in which Isis poisons the superior god Ra and refuses to cure him unless he reveals his secret name to her. Upon learning the name, she tells it to her son, Horus, and by learning it they gain greater knowledge and power.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} World War I {{there were}} no traditions of nationally commemorating mass {{casualties}} in war. France and Germany had been relatively recently involved in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 to 1871. Germany had built a number of national war memorials commemorating their victory, usually focusing on celebrating their military leaders. In France, memorials to their losses were relatively common, but {{far from being a}} national response, and many towns and villages did not erect memorials at all. A new organisation, the Souvenir Français, was established in the 1880s to protect French war memorials and encourage young French people to engage in military activities; the organisation grew <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> contacts in local government by 1914.|$|E

5|$|The Serre {{spectral}} sequence {{was used}} by Serre to prove some of the results mentioned previously. He used the fact that taking the loop space of a well behaved space shifts all the homotopy groups down by 1, so the nth homotopy group of a space X is the first homotopy group of its (n−1)-fold repeated loop space, which {{is equal to the}} first homology group of the (n−1)-fold loop space by the Hurewicz theorem. This reduces the calculation of homotopy groups of X to the calculation of homology groups of its repeated loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence relates the homology of a space to that of its loop space, so can sometimes be used to calculate the homology of loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence tends <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> non-zero differentials, which are hard to control, and too many ambiguities appear for higher homotopy groups. Consequently, it has been superseded by more powerful spectral sequences with fewer non-zero differentials, which give more information.|$|E

50|$|Mitchel Whitington (born 1959) is an American {{author and}} paranormal {{researcher}} {{with a passion}} for history. Over three decades of his writing career, he <b>has</b> written <b>many</b> articles and books {{on the subject of the}} supernatural. Whitington has researched and explored haunted locations across the United States, and claims <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>many</b> encounters with the supernatural.|$|R
25|$|Guam is said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> more {{insects and}} 40 times more spiders than {{neighboring}} islands, because their natural predators birds are severely diminished, and the forests are almost completely silent {{due to lack}} of birdsong.|$|E
25|$|VSU advocates {{initially}} {{attempted to}} bring it about by running campus referendum campaigns calling for voluntary membership. Such campaigns, however, were consistently defeated. Nevertheless, a campaign was successfully run <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> student organisations disaffiliate themselves from AUS, causing its eventual collapse.|$|E
25|$|Mesmer {{was driven}} into exile {{soon after the}} {{investigations}} on animal magnetism although his influential student, Armand-Marie-Jacques de Chastenet, Marquis de Puségur (1751-1825), continued <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> followers until his death. Mesmer continued to practice in Frauenfeld, Switzerland {{for a number of}} years and died in 1815 in Meersburg, Germany.|$|E

25|$|In theory, a nanotorus is {{a carbon}} {{nanotube}} bent into a torus (doughnut shape). Nanotori are predicted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> unique properties, such as magnetic moments 1000 {{times larger than}} previously expected for certain specific radii. Properties such as magnetic moment, thermal stability, etc. vary widely depending on radius of the torus and radius of the tube.|$|E
25|$|Although she was {{too young}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> {{memories}} of her father, Nathalie Babel Brown {{went on to become}} one of the world's foremost scholars of his life and work. When a Norton Anthology of his writings was published in 2002, Nathalie edited the volume and provided a foreword. She died in Washington DC in 2005.|$|E
25|$|In film, Pixar {{began its}} serious {{commercial}} rise {{in this era}} under Edwin Catmull, with its first major film release, in 1995 - Toy Story - a critical and commercial success of nine-figure magnitude.

25|$|The {{underwater}} speleothems in the Yucatán Peninsula are fragile. If a diver accidentally {{breaks a}} formation, {{it will not}} reform {{as long as the}} cave is underwater so active cave conservation diving techniques are necessary. The Quintana Roo caves are extremely complex with anastomotic interconnected passages. When diving through the caves, they appear <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> offshoots and junctions, requiring careful navigation with permanent tees or the implementation of jumps in the guideline.|$|E
25|$|Large American {{cities like}} New York and Los Angeles tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> {{distinct}} ambulance services, {{each with its}} own paint scheme and using all of the ambulance types mentioned above. Pedestrians and drivers in such cities must be alert for ambulances of many shapes, sizes, and colors. Most ambulances certified for emergency response in the U.S. are marked with the Star of Life for ready identification by the public.|$|E
25|$|When the First World War {{broke out}} at the {{beginning}} of August in 1914, the common belief was, that the war would only last {{for a couple of months}} at most. The shipyard management did not expect <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> orders, and therefore reduced the headcount. But after a while the order intake increased; the Imperial Russian Army ordered more vessels, ship repair projects and gave various other assignments. The earlier declared ban the Emipre had laid down towards orders from Finnish companies was practically omitted.|$|E

25|$|In Superman: Red Son, Bizarro {{was one of}} many creatures {{created by}} Lex Luthor and the American CIA in {{attempts}} to destroy the threat posed by the Communist Superman. This version was very similar in appearance to villain Solomon Grundy and wore a uniform similar to the original Golden-Age Superman. He was said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> of the same powers & abilities as Superman. After endangering much of London in his battle with Superman, Bizarro sacrificed himself to save the city from a nuclear detonation.|$|E
25|$|At daybreak on Friday, 13 October 1307, {{hundreds}} of Templars in France were simultaneously arrested by agents of Philip the Fair, to be later tortured into admitting heresy in the Order. The Templars were supposedly answerable to only the Pope, but Philip used his influence over Clement V, who was largely his pawn, to disband the organization. Pope Clement did attempt to hold proper trials, but Philip used the previously forced confessions <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> Templars {{burned at the}} stake before they could mount a proper defense.|$|E
25|$|Reception {{to the new}} Taurus by {{automotive}} publications {{was generally}} positive. Road & Track gave the Taurus a good review upon its release, and found its handling and refinement impressive. Motor Trend also gave the Taurus a positive review, although they found the oval styling awkward at first glance. Despite this, they found it <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> redeeming qualities. However, unlike the first-generation Taurus, it fell short of their Car of the Year award, which was instead awarded to the redesigned 1996 Dodge Caravan.|$|E
