"I do {{not know}} whether the plan I have thought of will commend itself to your opinion, sir, but I have worked out a scheme which will, I think, enable us {{to get to the bottom}} of the matter.

Before we board her I should disguise myself as a Turkish slave, and as such Sir John should hand me over to the officer in command of the galley, giving him a letter of private instructions from you as to my disposal. If they have other slaves on board I would ask that I should be kept apart from them, as well as from the rowers of the galley. On being landed I should be sent to the prison where I saw the officer enter last night, and the slaves and rowers should be distributed among the other prisons. Thus, then, the slaves I should be placed with would only know that I had arrived in the galley with other slaves captured by it. I have no doubt I should be able to maintain my assumed character, and should in a short time be taken into the confidence of the others, and should learn what is going on. It would be well, of course, that none of the officials of the prison should be informed as to my true character, for others, besides the one I saw, may have been bribed to participate in whatever plot is going on." ...|$|E

40|$|As {{enrollment}} managers, {{we often}} focus on substance over symbols. <b>Today’s</b> crisis <b>or</b> <b>tomorrow’s</b> enrollment numbers capture our undivided attention while the symbolic decisions, actions, stories, and traditions that Bolman and Deal (1991) speak {{to in the}} symbolic frame go virtually unnoticed. Is this appropriate {{given the nature of}} enrollment management? Or is there value in the symbolic? In relation to the symbolic frame, an organization is a unique culture driven by stories, ceremonies, rituals, and heroes. This is in contrast to other frameworks in which an organization is driven by rules, authority or policies (Bolman and Deal, 1991). Symbolic decisions, particularly those related to resource allocation, internal promotions or hires, job assignments, reorganization, and oddly enough, space allocation, often impact staff morale and consequently, performance. Intended or unintended messages conveyed from such symbolic decisions yield power within an enrollment organization. These messages have the power to invigorate or kill a change effort. They can stimulate innovative, “outside the box ” thinking or stifle creativity altogether. They can produce hope or fear within an enrollment management culture.

40|$|Several <b>todays</b> <b>or</b> <b>tomorrows</b> {{composite}} {{aerospace structures}} are simultaneously loaded by mechanical and thermal loads. As illustrative examples may serve the load-carrying structure of future reusable launch vehicles under aero-thermodynamical loads, orbital structures subjected to cyclic thermal loading, or even composite wings and fuselage of passenger aircraft, which can reach temperatures {{of more than}} 100 °C during stay on the ground. In these cases a thermal analysis providing the temperature field must precede the stress analysis, which has to account for thermal as well as additional mechanical loads. Presently, thermal analyses are mostly carried out by finite difference methods or by 3 D finite elements. Some finite element codes provide shell elements for 3 D heat transfer. However, they are not applicable to thermally anisotropic laminated composites. The stress analysis is usually performed by use of shell elements based {{on some kind of}} lamination theory. Thus, the temperature field has to be transferred from a finite difference or 3 D finite element model to a shell finite element model. This process needs a lot of handwork and is very time consuming. The paper presents an integrated analysis process which uses a shell finite element model throughout. It starts with micromechanical investigations for providing homogenized thermo-physical properties. Then, Thermal Lamination Theories are discussed and related finite elements are formulated. The thermal analysis part of the paper concludes with an experimental verification of the numerical results. Furthermore, a stress analysis process is shown which uses the shell geometry model from the thermal analysis and delivers the full state of stress inclusive of all transverse stress components. Accounting for the transverse stresses is very important for correctly predicting the failure of composite structures. This is underlined by comparing common 2 D-failure criteria with advanced 3 D-criteria. The paper ends with a combined thermal and stress analysis of a composite wing box of the future European Megaliner A 3 XX...|$|R

5000|$|For {{a college}} coach, {{practicing}} good ethics {{in this regard}} means creating goals that are within reach for a team, and working together with members of a team when creating these goals. Larson and LaFasto in their 1989 book [...] "TeamWork" [...] place a clear & elevating goal {{at the forefront of}} the necessary components for a successful team. [...] "The image of a desired state of affairs that inspires action" [...] is how Garfield defines a clear goal, according to the authors (p. 27). They say that when the goal is [...] "unfocused and [...] "politicized", it becomes a reason for ineffective team functioning. [...] "A sense of mission" [...] is a clear characteristic of peak performers', says Garfield, according to the authors. Larson and LaFasto make no mistake in emphasizing the importance of clarity. [...] "Elevating" [...] to the authors means [...] "personally challenging" [...] (p. 31). A player asks the personal question of how worthwhile the goal itself is, and what type of difference it makes. The elevating factor of goal setting brings about a sense of urgency, causes a team to lose track of time (relates to the idea of [...] "flow" [...] in the field of positive psychology), and causes the rate of communication to increase, for example, players calling one another in the evening, outside the sport context, to talk about <b>today's</b> practice <b>or</b> <b>tomorrow's</b> game.|$|R
