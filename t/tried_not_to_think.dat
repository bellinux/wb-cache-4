5|$|Growing up {{as part of}} a lucha libre {{family the}} future Espanto Jr. decided he wanted to follow in the {{footsteps}} of his father and grandfather at an early age. In a 2010 interview he recalled how he would be in the front row watching his father wrestle from the time he could walk. In 1996 his father suffered an injury during a match and was briefly clinically dead while in the ring until he was revived. While the injury left a big impression on the then-10 year old he later accepted that it was an accident and <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it, but did comment that his mother still worried about him every time he competed.|$|E
500|$|As {{the number}} of First World War {{veterans}} dwindled, calls grew to give the last remaining veteran a state funeral. The calls resulted in Her Majesty's Government approving on 27 June 2006 a National Memorial Service at Westminster Abbey to take place {{after the death of}} the last known British First World War veteran. Before this announcement Allingham often said that he <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about the prospect, but has also been quoted as saying [...] "I don't mind— as long as it's not me." [...] Allingham received a letter from Member of Parliament Tom Watson on 14 July 2006 explaining the reasoning for a national memorial service rather than a state funeral, as the intention is to commemorate the entire generation that fought in the war rather than single out an individual.|$|E

I've been for easy-going all my life. But I'm that worried and afraid, with death and ruin threatened and evil all about me! I don't know what to do! My own sister's son, and me a widow woman and 'elpless against his doin's!" ...|$|R

60|$|As Kirk had endeavoured {{temporarily}} {{to forget}} Ruth, so had he <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of Mamie. It {{was the only}} thing he was ashamed of in the whole affair, the shock he must have given her.|$|E
6000|$|He had awaited {{this event}} for so long, {{thought of it}} so often in such {{a great variety of}} relationships, dreamt of it, hoped for it, prayed for it, and <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it, that now it came to him in reality it seemed to have no {{substance}} or significance whatever. He had exhausted the fact before it happened. Since first he had thought of it there had passed four long years, and in that time he had seen it from every aspect, exhausted every possibility. It had become a theoretical possibility, the basis of continually less confident, continually more unsubstantial day dreams. Constantly he had <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it, tried to assure himself of Sir Isaac's invalid immortality. And here it was! ...|$|E

60|$|The {{people were}} astir already, moving rapidly, in one direction, through the streets.

60|$|Master Toogood <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of ghosts, nor of {{the many}} stories of pixies and goblins which are said to take a {{malicious}} pleasure in the timorousness of mankind, but of a truth he nearly uttered a cry of terror, and would have fallen on his knees in the mud, when a dark object quite undistinguishable in the gloom suddenly loomed before him.|$|E

I've <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> selfishly about it, but I can't pretend that my wish isn't selfish. It is! I want you for myself, and because I've always wanted you, and not for any other reason. I never cared for any one but you in the way I cared for you, and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought of}} that," [...] he {{answered}} simply. [...] "I didn't {{see how it}} could be done. But if you saw any way, I was willing--No, that was my great trouble! I knew that it was selfish in me, and very conceited, to suppose you would give up your whole life for me; and whenever I thought of that, I determined not to ask you. But I <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of that." ...|$|E

60|$|The weary hours roll on. Too {{tired to}} stand longer, {{he sits down}} on the shafts of a cart, and <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> It is <b>not</b> difficult. Body and mind are alike worn out, and his brain seems filled with uniform dull mist.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I said that," [...] he {{answered}} slowly; [...] "I was feelin' a bit low. You can't help it sometimes; it's the thing comin' on you, {{and no way}} out of it--that's what gets over you. We <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it, as a rule." ...|$|R

60|$|The more Chatterer <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of {{how good}} {{something}} to eat would taste, the more he did think of it. It made him restless and uneasy. He twisted and squirmed and turned. At last {{he decided that he}} would have one more look to see if he couldn't find some {{way to get out of}} his prison. He poked his head out of the little round doorway. All was still and dark. He listened, but not a sound could he hear. Then he softly crept out and hurriedly examined all the inside of his prison once more. It was of no use! There wasn't a single place where he could use his sharp teeth.|$|E
60|$|I was horrified. For {{the first}} time I {{realized}} vividly all that she had gone through. When she had spoken to me before of her struggles that evening over the study fire, I had supposed that they had begun only after her husband's death, and that her life with him had in some measure trained her for the fight. That {{she should have been}} pitched into the arena, a mere child, with no experience of life, appalled me. And, as she spoke, there came to me the knowledge that now I could never do what I had come to do. I could not give her up. She needed me. I <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of Cynthia.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] protested Mrs Fyne. [...] "It is {{your former}} governess who is horrid and odious. She is a vile woman.

You must <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of these abominations, my dear child." ...|$|R

60|$|And while Lady Harman {{was making}} these meritorious and industrious {{attempts}} {{to grasp the}} significance of life and to get some clear idea of her social duty, the developments of those Hostels she had started--she now felt so prematurely--was going on. There were times when she <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of them, {{turned her back on}} them, fled from them, and times when they and what she ought to do about them and what they ought to be and what they ought not to be, filled her mind to the exclusion of every other topic. Rigorously and persistently Sir Isaac insisted they were hers, asked her counsel, demanded her appreciation, presented as it were his recurring bill for them.|$|E
60|$|Gradually, however, in {{intervals}} of happy mind-wanderings, other thoughts intruded. This little bedroom affected her singularly {{and she was}} at a loss to account for the fact. It did not seem that she was actually afraid to be there, for she was glad. Fear of Durade and his gang recurred, but she believed that the time of her deliverance was close at hand. Possibly Durade, with some of his men, had been killed in the fight with Hough. Then she remembered having heard the Spaniard order Fresno and Mull to go round by the street. They must be on her trail at this very moment. Ancliffe had been seen, and not much time could elapse before her whereabouts would be discovered. But Allie bore up bravely. She was in the thick of grim and bloody and horrible reality. Those brave men, strangers to her, had looked into her face, questioned her, then had died for her. It was all so unbelievable. In another room, close to her, lay Ancliffe, dead. Allie <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of him; of the remorseless way in which he had killed the Mexican; of the contrast between this action and his gentle voice and manner. She <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the gambler Hough--the cold iron cast of his face as he won Durade's gold, the strange, intent look which he gave her a moment before the attack. There was something magnificent in Ancliffe's bringing her to a refuge while he was dying; there was something magnificent in Hough's standing off the gang. Allie divined that through her these two men had fought and died for something in themselves as well as for her honor and life.|$|E
60|$|Once in the street, {{he stood}} for some time on the pavement, {{wondering}} whether, after all, {{he was not an}} ass not to have discharged his pistol. And then again he decided that to talk to any one whomsoever about the Bellegardes would be extremely disagreeable to him. The least disagreeable thing, under the circumstances, was to banish them from his mind, and never think of them again. Indecision had not hitherto been one of Newman's weaknesses, and in this case it was not of long duration. For three days after this he did not, or at least he <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to,</b> <b>think</b> of the Bellegardes. He dined with Mrs. Tristram, and on her mentioning their name, he begged her almost severely to desist. This gave Tom Tristram a much-coveted opportunity to offer his condolences.|$|E
