30|$|Images {{produce a}} <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> their own. This {{specific}} reality cannot be grasped by dualistically separating {{it from an}} alleged <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> ‘the factual’. We can clearly see this effect of creating an ‘own’ <b>reality</b> in works <b>of</b> art of abstract modernism displaying something which eludes objective, measurable and countable approaches. What is displayed by these images points to meaning (or emotion) rather than matter. This implicit meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image is perceived as <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image. From an epistemological perspective, <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image and <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factual are incongruent and disparate (Schütz 2016 a, 2016 b). <b>The</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image with its inherent logic and materiality can become tangible precisely in this incongruity. From an epistemological point <b>of</b> view, <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image is not only perceived as reality, but also responded to immediately. <b>The</b> multitude <b>of</b> experiences which are constituted while looking at an image are immediate responses to <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image. <b>The</b> inherent, experiential <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image is grounded in this pre-verbal and implicit meaning.|$|R

25|$|While the fruitless {{negotiations}} {{were taking place}} the Fallschirmjägers were preparing {{to move away from}} their stronghold and find a new place to fight from. The arrival of the two Norwegian mortars had completely changed the tactical situation and the German force′s supply of ammunition was also running dangerously low. Schmidt decided that he had to move his troops into a new and more defensible position. Negotiations were kept up to buy time so the paratroopers could slip away into cover of darkness. Schmidt believed that strong German forces were advancing up the Gudbrandsdal valley and that if he could hold out for a little while longer the situation might still be salvaged. <b>The</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> was however that the German advanced units were stuck just north of Minnesund far to the south of both Gudbrandsdal and Dombås.|$|E
25|$|Like Louverture, Jean-Baptiste Belley {{was also}} an active {{participant}} in the colony's insurrection. The portrait of Belley by Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson depicts a man who encompasses the French view of its colonies. The portrait creates a stark dichotomy between the refinement of French Enlightenment thought and <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in Saint Domingue, through the bust of Raynald and the figure of Belley, respectively. While distinguished, the portrait still portrays a man trapped by the confines of race. Girodet's portrayal of the former National Convention deputy is telling of the French opinion of colonial citizens by emphasizing the subject's sexuality and including an earring. Both of these racially charged symbols reveal the desire to undermine the colony's attempts at independent legitimacy, as citizens of the colonies were not able to access the elite class of French Revolutionaries because of their race.|$|E

25|$|Juin did {{not want}} Algeria {{occupied}} by the Americans {{any more than he}} wanted France occupied by the Germans, but he recognised <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b> Darlan authorised Juin to negotiate a local ceasefire in Algiers, so Juin met with American Major General Charles W. Ryder, commander of the U.S. 34th Infantry Division, and the two arranged {{for an end to the}} fighting. Algiers was handed over to the Americans, French troops were confined to barracks but retained their weapons, and French police maintained law and order. French resistance to the Allies continued elsewhere in North Africa until Darlan issued a ceasefire on 10 November, and directed Juin to order French forces in Tunisia to resist the Germans and the Italians. Juin's orders were not always obeyed by his subordinates in Tunisia, many of whom believed that Darlan and Juin were being held prisoner by the Americans, but he was able to personally persuade Noguès to work with the Allies.|$|E
25|$|This {{meant that}} a group of car valeters, {{although}} described in their contracts as being self-employed, with a right to substitute another person to do their work, and professed to have no obligation to undertake work, were entitled to a minimum wage and paid leave. The contract terms could be disregarded because they did not represent <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b> In addition, a ‘worker’ is defined in ERA 1996 section 230 as someone with a contract of employment or who personally performs work and is not a client or a customer. This concept has greater scope, and protects more people, than does the term ‘employee’. This class of person is entitled to a safe system of work, a minimum wage and limits on working time, as well as discrimination and trade union rights, but not job security, child care and retirement rights. This concept thus reaches up to protect people who are quasi-self-employed professionals, such as partners of a law firm. People will also be workers but not employees when they are not so vulnerable, and relatively independent from their employers, such as home cleaners, music teachers who visit a student home, or independent taxi cab drivers. However, if they are employed through an agency, they will be employees in relation to the agency. Though not entitled to employee rights, these workers may form trade unions and take collective action under UK, EU and international law, to protect their interests.|$|E

500|$|Unprepared by what {{historian}} Max Nettlau {{called the}} [...] "explosive imminence" [...] of the First World War at its outbreak in August 1914, anarchists resigned themselves to <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> and, after a time, began themselves to take sides. Like all nationals, the anarchists had been conditioned {{to react to}} the political interests of their nations, whose influence left few unaffected. On the climate of the time, Nettlau remarked: [...] "The air was saturated with accepted nations, conventional opinions and the peculiar illusions which people entertained concerning small nationalities and the virtues and defects of certain races. There were all sorts of plausible justifications for imperialism, for financial controls and so on. And, since Tolstoy had been dead since 1910, no voice of libertarian and moral power was heard in the world: no organisation, large or small, spoke up." [...] European anarchist activity was restricted both physically and by the internal divisions within the anarchist movement over attitudes towards the war.|$|E
500|$|On March 31, 2015, Billboard premiered a remix of {{the song}} by Dutch DJ Don Diablo, who changed the ballad into an EDM track. Another set of remixes were {{released}} later as a Remix EP.

According to Idolator, [...] "RedTop completely deconstructs 'Ghosttown' and turns it into something you might hear in a post-apocalyptic piano bar. It's sad and depressing yet defiantly groovy." [...] Another remix, by Paul Andrews, gave emphasis on Madonna's vocals while adding piano and orchestra in the production. Andrews explained that the music video of [...] "Ghosttown" [...] was how he had imagined it, [...] "two people in a dark place with destruction all around them, but they have each other".

5000|$|Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi had {{originally}} declared <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quran (haqiqat-i quran) and <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ka'ba (haqiqat-i ka'ba-yi rabbani) {{to be above}} <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> Muhammad (haqiqat-i Muhammadi). This caused fury of opposition, particularly among certain sufis and ulama of Hijaz who objected to the Ka'ba having exalted spiritual [...] "rank" [...] than the Prophet. Sirhindi argued in response that <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prophet is superior to any creature. The real Ka'ba is worthy of prostration since it is not created and is covered with <b>the</b> veil <b>of</b> nonexistence.
