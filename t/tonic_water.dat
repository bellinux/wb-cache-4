25|$|Mixer drinks {{became popular}} {{in the second half}} of the century. <b>Tonic</b> <b>water</b> was {{originally}} quinine added to water as a prophylactic against malaria and was consumed by British officials stationed in the tropical areas of South Asia and Africa. As the quinine powder was so bitter people began mixing the powder with soda and sugar, and a basic <b>tonic</b> <b>water</b> was created. The first commercial <b>tonic</b> <b>water</b> was produced in 1858. The mixed drink gin and tonic also originated in British colonial India, when the British population would mix their medicinal quinine tonic with gin.|$|E
50|$|In 1912 <b>tonic</b> <b>waters</b> were an {{uncommon}} drink. As such, Josiah Russell & Co reintroduced <b>tonic</b> <b>waters</b> {{under a new}} brand name: Club Tonic, which made it more exclusive and boosted the sales.|$|R

50|$|Carmelite {{water is}} an {{alcoholic}} extract of lemon balm and other herbs. It has been formulated by the Carmelite nuns from the Abbey of St Just in the 14th century, and was commercialized {{under the name}} Eau de Carmes.

25|$|Bitters {{prepared}} {{from the}} tree bark containing the antimalarial quinine were occasionally included in historical cocktail recipes, which served to mask the intensely bitter flavor of this medicine. Trace quantities of quinine are still included as a flavoring in <b>tonic</b> <b>water,</b> which is used today mostly in drinks with gin.|$|E
25|$|Quinine, {{a bitter}} {{medicinal}} found in <b>tonic</b> <b>water,</b> {{can be used}} to subjectively rate the bitterness of a substance. Units of dilute quinine hydrochloride (1 g in 2000 mL of water) {{can be used to}} measure the threshold bitterness concentration, the level at which the presence of a dilute bitter substance can be detected by a human taster, of other compounds. More formal chemical analysis, while possible, is difficult.|$|E
25|$|Sixteen {{different}} {{herbs are}} used to make Napue, including juniper, lemon peel, angelica and cardamom as well as locally foraged meadowsweet, cranberries, birch and sea buckthorn. The traditional Napue gin and tonic recipe that won at the IWSC is served with a Fever-Tree Indian <b>Tonic</b> <b>Water,</b> cranberries and rosemary. The rye gin is named after the Battle of Napue fought between the Swedish Empire and the Tsardom of Russia close to the distillery's location in 1714 during the Great Northern War.|$|E

40|$|Most logologists {{have noticed}} that some words, such as SHAME and SHARE, are {{relatively}} near each other, whereas others, such as <b>TONIC</b> and <b>WATER,</b> are far apart. If pressed for a definition of the distance between two words, they might {{suggest that it is}} equal to the number of letters that must be altered to transmute one word into the other. The nearer two words are to each other, the easier it is to accidentally change one into another by a typographical miscue. A large number of English words are only one letter apart, a situation humorously exploited for many years in the Readers Digest column 2 ̆ 2 Pardon, Your Slip Is Showing 2 ̆ 2. Students of the language have suggested that English has more potentiality for mistakes of this sort than other languages do; see, for example, Petr Beckmann 2 ̆ 7 s The Structure of Language: A New Approach (Golem Press, 1972) for the development of this idea...|$|R
2500|$|Unlike {{other women}} of her time, Elisabeth used little {{cosmetics}} or perfume, as {{she wished to}} showcase her natural beauty, but she tested countless beauty products prepared in the court pharmacy, or prepared by a lady-in-waiting in her own apartments, to preserve it. Although one favorite, [...] "Crème Céleste", was compounded from white wax, spermaceti, sweet almond oil, and rosewater; she attached far less importance to creams and emollients, and experimented {{with a wide variety}} of facial <b>tonics</b> and <b>waters,</b> from which she apparently expected more results. Elisabeth slept without a pillow on a metal bedstead, all the better to retain her upright posture, with either raw veal or crushed strawberries lining her nightly leather facial mask. She was heavily massaged and often slept with cloths soaked in either violet- or cider-vinegar above her hips to preserve her slim waist, and her neck was wrapped with cloths soaked in Kummerfeld-toned washing water. To further preserve her skin tone, she took both a cold shower every morning (which in later years aggravated her arthritis) and an olive oil bath in the evening.|$|R
25|$|Bitterness is {{the most}} {{sensitive}} of the tastes, and many perceive it as unpleasant, sharp, or disagreeable, but it is sometimes desirable and intentionally added via various bittering agents. Common bitter foods and beverages include coffee, unsweetened cocoa, South American mate, bitter gourd, olives, citrus peel, many plants in the Brassicaceae family, dandelion greens, wild chicory, and escarole. The ethanol in alcoholic beverages tastes bitter, as do the additional bitter ingredients found in some alcoholic beverages including hops in beer and orange in bitters. Quinine is also known for its bitter taste and is found in <b>tonic</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E

According to a recipe book The Boston Chef's Table, this cocktail is sold in the Cheers Beacon Hill, the pub the show was modeled after. The recipe book itself also provides ingredients of this cocktail: [...] "orange-infused rum, dark rum, amaretto, cranberry juice, and pineapple juice". Colleen Graham from About.com provides different ingredients for the [...] "Screaming Viking" [...] cocktail recipe: [...] "vodka, dry vermouth, lime juice, celery stalk, and [...] cucumber spear".

2500|$|In {{tropical}} British colonies gin {{was used}} to mask the bitter flavour of quinine, which was the only effective anti-malarial compound. Quinine was dissolved in carbonated water to form tonic water; the resulting cocktail is gin and tonic, although modern <b>tonic</b> <b>water</b> contains only a trace of quinine as a flavouring. Gin is a common base spirit for many mixed drinks, including the martini. Secretly produced [...] "bathtub gin" [...] was available in the speakeasies and [...] "blind pigs" [...] of Prohibition-era America {{as a result of}} the relative simple production.|$|E
40|$|Tonic immobility was induced {{in black}} tipped reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanoptera) {{and heart rate}} and ventral aortic blood {{pressure}} recorded. Without branchial irrigation, tonic immobility was correlated with a significant depression in blood pressure and heart rate irrespective of the sharks being in air or in <b>water.</b> <b>Tonic</b> immobility with branchial irrigation resulted in {{a significant increase in}} blood pressure in sharks in air, but not in water. Heart rate was unchanged when the gills were irrigated. Intra-arterial injections of atropine abolished the bradycardia and blood pressure rise associated with tonic immobility. We conclude that, during tonic immobility, sharks are able to receive afferent information from the ventilatory system and make appropriate responses via the vagus nerve...|$|R

In an interview with the Port-Courier, a newspaper in Papua New Guinea, that he gave 12 hours before his death, Kabui said that he had stopped taking his heart medicine four months beforehand and was taking a <b>water</b> <b>tonic</b> instead because the medicine was too expensive. He dismissed suggestions of seeking help, saying that [...] "I am not a man that would ask for things that concern me", and he also said that he had missed a medical check-up because he was too busy with work. His next check-up was scheduled for later in June, but he noted that the necessary trip to Australia was expensive as well.|$|R
5000|$|Kellogg's use of {{hydrotherapy}} was a {{more sophisticated}} development {{of the system that}} was utilized in the early 19th century by Vincent Priessnitz, which, when introduced to America, was essentially a [...] "cold water cure", although [...] "as a <b>tonic,</b> cold <b>water</b> has no superior". [...] "The crude, but thoroughgoing methods of the original system of Priessnitz, which prospered among the hardy mountaineers of Austrian Silesia, were much too strenuous for more delicately organized and pampered American invalids. This fact, together with the crass empiricism which characterized the use of water {{in the first half of}} the last century, when water-cures were for a time almost a fad, brought water into general disrepute as a curative means, and greatly hindered the scientific development of this invaluable agent". The Battle Creek system utilized both hot and cold water, and correlated the use of hydrotherapy with other therapeutic modalities. Among the methods used were douches, sitz baths, cold mitten frictions, salt glows, towel rubs, wet sheet rubs, wet and dry packings, compresses, [...] "full baths of various sorts, including Nauheim baths, electro-hydric baths, shallow and neutral baths". The use of hot and cold applications was to produce [...] "profound reflex effects", including vasodilation and vasoconstriction. These physiological mechanisms now seem fairly well understood, and underpin the contemporary use of hydrotherapy, with the reflex reactions described by some as the 'rebound phenomenon' ...|$|R

Some manufacturers also produce diet (or slimline) <b>tonic</b> <b>water,</b> which may contain artificial sweeteners such as aspartame. Traditional-style <b>tonic</b> <b>water</b> with little more than quinine and carbonated water is less common, but may be preferred by those who desire the bitter flavor.|$|E
