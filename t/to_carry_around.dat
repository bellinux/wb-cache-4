Experiments with trains as long as 38 tubs were carried out, but the difficulty of splitting the train {{to pass through the}} locks meant that 19 was the usual maximum. The compartments continued until the late 1960s <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>around</b> half a million tons of coal, long after most British canals had ceased to be used for commercial traffic, but the gradual demise of the coal industry led to compartment traffic ceasing in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Styles went on {{to defend}} the {{championship}} against Petey Williams, while Daniels and Joe competed in a Four-on-Four Tag Team Elimination X match at Genesis. Styles retained the title at the event, while Daniels and Joe's team were the victors in their contest. After Daniels and Joe won their match, Joe assaulted Daniels by bashing him {{over the head with}} a steel chair and slamming him on a steel chair back-first. Daniels was sidelined with an injury in the storyline {{as a result of these}} action. Thereafter, Joe proceeded <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>around</b> a blood stained towel from the attack. Joe's action at Genesis angered Styles in the storyline, as Styles accused Joe of violating the unwritten code of the TNA X Division. Styles followed by challenging Joe to a match at Turning Point for the TNA X Division Championship on the November19, 2005 episode of Impact!, which Joe accepted. On the December3, 2005 episode of Impact!, Joe attacked Styles, claiming he did not care about the X Division code.|$|E
25|$|The first {{electrical}} {{hearing aid}} used the carbon microphone {{of the telephone}} and was introduced in 1896. The vacuum tube made electronic amplification possible, but early versions of amplified hearing aids were too heavy <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>around.</b> Miniaturization of vacuum tubes lead to portable models, and after World War II, wearable models using miniature tubes. The transistor invented in 1948 was well suited to the hearing aid application due to low power and small size; hearing aids were an early adopter of transistors. The development of integrated circuits allowed further improvement of the capabilities of wearable aids, including implementation of digital signal processing techniques and programmability for the individual user's needs.|$|E

Hawkins and Reks then lost a non-title match to Air Boom on the December 22 episode of Superstars. Hawkins debuted on Raw on January 9, 2012, and was quickly defeated by a returning Brodus Clay. Hawkins and Reks feuded with Trent Barreta and Yoshi Tatsu from December 2011. Both teams regularly played pranks on each other, Tatsu being locked in a closet and Reks' hands being superglued onto an Xbox controller. The feud ended when Hawkins and Reks defeated Barreta and Tatsu on the January 18 episode of NXT.|$|E
25|$|The tunnel was {{predicted}} by Rivercity Motorways <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>around</b> 60,000 trips each day. Without a toll {{an average of}} 59,000 vehicles used the tunnel but when the reduced toll was payable around 20,000 vehicles used the tunnel. The lower traffic volumes resulted in the toll discount period being extended to 30 June 2010, and again until September. After the poor patronage figures were released Rivercity Motorway shares immediately dropped by one fifth of their value, and have since declined to 0% of their initial value. The peak of 27,000 vehicles was reached on 14 May 2010. A new record of 34,705 vehicles was reached on 13 August 2010. As of February 2012 the average volume is 21,990 vehicles per day, less than 50% of the predicted opening volume. On 25 February 2011, Rivercity Motorways was placed into receivership after being unable to pay interest on its debt. Between June 2011 and June 2012, vehicle traffic decreased by 9% {{to an average of}} 24,055 vehicles per day.|$|E

The commentary established Du Fu's fame as the highest of all poets; for instance, Hayashi Shunsai, a notable Confucian scholar, commented in Vol. 37 of Gahō Bunshū that Zǐměi [...] was the very best poet in history and praised Shào Chuán's commentary for its simplicity and readability, while he criticized old commentaries during the Yuan Dynasty were too unfathomable. Matsuo Bashō, the greatest haiku poet, was also strongly influenced by Du Fu; in Oku no Hosomichi, his masterpiece, he cites the first two lines of A Spring View (春望) before a haiku as its introduction and also many of his other haiku have similar wording and themes. It is {{said that when he}} died in Osaka during a long travel, a copy of Du Fu's poetry was found with him as one of a few precious items which he was able <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>around.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In the 1920s, it {{was very}} hard for a {{musician}} playing a pickup-equipped guitar to find an amplifier and speaker to make their instrument louder as the only speakers that could be bought were [...] "radio horns of limited frequency range and low acoustic output". The cone speaker, widely used in 2000s-era amp cabinets, was not offered for sale until 1925. The first amplifiers and speakers could only be powered with large batteries, which made them heavy and hard <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>around.</b> When engineers developed the first AC mains-powered amplifiers, they were soon used to make musical instruments louder.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{the use of}} paper, the Chinese used coins {{that were}} circular, with a {{rectangular}} hole in the middle. Several coins could be strung together on a rope. Merchants in China, if they became rich enough, found that their strings of coins were too heavy <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>around</b> easily. To solve this problem, coins were often left with a trustworthy person, and the merchant was given {{a slip of paper}} recording how much money he had with that person. If he showed the paper to that person he could regain his money. Eventually, the Song Dynasty paper money called [...] "jiaozi" [...] originated from these promissory notes.|$|E

This happened in the USA during the Great Depression of the 1930s, leading President Roosevelt to impose a national emergency and issue Executive Order 6102 outlawing the [...] "hoarding" [...] of gold by US citizens.

2500|$|The {{first group}} is the marine hermit crabs (with a single species, Clibanarius fonticola, in freshwater). These crabs {{spend most of their}} life {{underwater}} as aquatic animals, live in varying depths of saltwater from shallow reefs and shorelines to deep sea bottoms and rarely leave for land. As pets, several marine species of hermit crabs are common in the marine aquarium trade. They are commonly kept in reef fish tanks. [...] They breathe through gills but they don't have <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>around</b> their water to do so. Most can survive briefly out of water as long as their gills are damp. However, this ability is not as developed as it is in land hermit crabs. A few species do not use a [...] "mobile home" [...] and inhabit immobile structures left by polychaete worms, vermetid gastropods, corals, and sponges.|$|E
2500|$|Louis Armstrong thought {{enough of}} Miller <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>around</b> his recordings, {{transferred}} to seven-inch tape reels {{when he went}} on tour. [...] " [...] liked musicians who prized melody, and his selections ranged from Glenn Miller to Jelly Roll Morton to Tchaikovsky." [...] Jazz pianist George Shearing's quintet of the 1950s and 1960s was influenced by Miller: [...] "with Shearing's locked hands style piano (influenced by the voicing of Miller's saxophone section) in the middle [...] ". Frank Sinatra and Mel Tormé held the orchestra in high regard. Tormé credited Miller with giving him helpful advice when he first started his singing and song-writing career in the 1940s. Mel Tormé met Glenn Miller in 1942, the meeting facilitated by Tormé's father and Ben Pollack. Tormé and Miller discussed [...] "That Old Black Magic", which was just emerging as a new song by Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen. Miller told Tormé to pick up every song by Mercer and study it and to become a voracious reader of anything he could find, because [...] "all good lyric writers are great readers." [...] In an interview with George T. Simon in 1948, Sinatra lamented the inferior quality of music he was recording in the late forties, in comparison with [...] "those great Glenn Miller things" [...] from eight years earlier. Frank Sinatra's recording sessions from the late forties and early fifties use some Miller musicians. Trigger Alpert, a bassist from the civilian band, Zeke Zarchy for the Army Air Forces Band and Willie Schwartz, the lead clarinetist from the civilian band back up Frank Sinatra on many recordings. With opposite opinion, fellow bandleader Artie Shaw frequently disparaged the band after Miller's death: [...] "All I {{can say is that}} Glenn should have lived, and 'Chattanooga Choo Choo' should have died." [...] Clarinetist Buddy DeFranco surprised many people when he led the Glenn Miller Orchestra in the late sixties and early seventies. De Franco was already a veteran of bands like Gene Krupa and Tommy Dorsey in the 1940s. He was also a major exponent of modern jazz in the 1950s. He never saw Miller as leading a swinging jazz band, but DeFranco is extremely fond of certain aspects of the Glenn Miller style. [...] "I found that when I opened with the sound of 'Moonlight Serenade', I could look around and see men and women weeping as the music carried them back to years gone by." [...] De Franco says, [...] "the beauty of Glenn Miller's ballads [...] caused people to dance together." ...|$|E
