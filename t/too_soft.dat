5|$|Students {{continued}} {{to occupy the}} library and challenge governmental control by raiding a brothel. They also kidnapped ten Chinese nationals, {{as well as several}} law enforcement officials, women, and children. The approach taken by the Pakistani government in dealing with mosque issues led to accusations of leniency on the part of Musharraf, who felt he was <b>too</b> <b>soft.</b> After exchanging fire with Pakistani troops, students set fire to a Ministry of Environment building near Lal Masjid.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the stop lines and the {{anti-tank}} islands that followed was to hold up the enemy, slowing progress and restricting the route of an attack. The need to prevent tanks from breaking through was of key importance. Consequently, the defences generally ran along pre-existing barriers to tanks such as rivers and canals; railway embankments and cuttings; thick woods; and other natural obstacles. Where possible, usually well-drained land was allowed to flood, making the ground <b>too</b> <b>soft</b> to support even tracked vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{painting}} Bảo Đại as {{a sexually}} insatiable glutton, Diệm's campaign also attacked {{the head of}} state's nationalist credentials. They criticised him as being <b>too</b> <b>soft</b> in his dealings with French colonial authorities, and for serving {{as the head of}} state of the Empire of Vietnam, a puppet regime set up by Imperial Japan after they invaded during World War II. They also accused him of ceding half the country to the communists. The communists had already captured more than half the country on the battlefield, and Diệm claimed he had no choice, but Diệm's campaign portrayed him as incompetent and unwilling to take the blame.|$|E

5|$|For {{their efforts}} {{the men are}} given a week's leave: the {{airfield}} where they are based comes under enemy artillery bombardment; Bell receives a letter from his wife informing him that she has {{fallen in love with}} someone else and wishes to divorce; Captain Staros is relieved of his command by Lieutenant Colonel Tall, who deems him <b>too</b> <b>soft</b> for the pressures of combat and suggests that he apply for reassignment and become a lawyer in the JAG in Washington. He offers to arrange a Purple Heart for Staros, to avoid the unit's name being stained by having an officer removed from command. Witt comes across the locals and notices that they have grown distant and distrustful of him and quarrel regularly with one another.|$|E
5|$|Most other binary alloys are {{of little}} use: for example, silver–gold alloys are <b>too</b> <b>soft</b> and silver–cadmium alloys too toxic. Ternary alloys have much greater importance: dental {{amalgams}} are usually silver–tin–mercury alloys, silver–copper–gold alloys {{are very important}} in jewellery (usually on the gold-rich side) and have a vast range of hardnesses and colours, silver–copper–zinc alloys are useful as low-melting brazing alloys, and silver–cadmium–indium (involving three adjacent elements on the periodic table) is useful in nuclear reactors because of its high thermal neutron capture cross-section, good conduction of heat, mechanical stability, and resistance to corrosion in hot water.|$|E
5|$|They have a white {{double coat}} which {{requires}} regular brushing {{with a wire}} comb {{in order to prevent}} matting. It has a dense undercoat, while the outer coat is wiry and weather resistant. Markings on the face can be in a variety of colours including lemon, black, brown, blue, and badger, which is a mix of brown and black. Heavy body markings or patches or excessive ticking on the coat are discouraged. Sealyhams are low to the ground, and in muddy weather their long coats can become quite dirty. Sealyham coats are groomed by hand stripping, {{in order to keep the}} coat from becoming <b>too</b> <b>soft.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{simplest}} {{way to gain}} information about brain anatomy is by visual inspection, but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed. Brain tissue in its natural state is <b>too</b> <b>soft</b> to work with, {{but it can be}} hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives, and then sliced apart for examination of the interior. Visually, the interior of the brain consists of areas of so-called grey matter, with a dark color, separated by areas of white matter, with a lighter color. Further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations. It is also possible to examine the microstructure of brain tissue using a microscope, and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another.|$|E
5|$|The cricketer {{refused to}} think that his {{candidacy}} was simply there {{to make up the}} numbers, and he told Bolte as much. The start of the election campaign coincided with the 1954–55 grade cricket finals. Loxton took 7 wickets and scored 129 runs to help Prahran claim the title {{for the first time in}} 32 years, and was hailed as a local hero. It capped off a season in which he topped the competition batting averages and took the most wickets. In a close-run contest, the cricketer defeated the sitting ALP member Bob Pettiona by only 14 votes on the two party preferred count. He was aided by preferences from the Democratic Labor Party (DLP), which had broken away from the ALP during the 1950s, claiming that it was <b>too</b> <b>soft</b> towards communism; fears of left-wing influence was causing great concern in Australian society at the time. Loxton polled 35.70% of the first preferences, well behind Pettiona's 47.25%, but received almost all of the DLP's 13.66% of the vote as preferences to end with 50.04%. The result helped bring Bolte's Liberals to power, and they stayed in office until 1982, by which time Loxton had retired.|$|E

On that last night of opera, without pity Siegmund had struck the closing phrases from the fiddle, harsh in his impatience, wild in anticipation.|$|R

50|$|The {{branches}} {{of these plants}} ended in cone-like structures. They did not produce seeds like many modern plants. Instead, it reproduced by means of spores. It is estimated that these plants grew rapidly and lived 10-15 years. This is indeed plausible, since Cottonwoods <b>too</b> have <b>soft</b> wood and grow fast- they {{have been known to}} reach 100 feet tall in fifteen years sometimes. Some species were probably monocarpic, meaning they reproduced only once toward the end of their life cycle.|$|R

And I noticed now she was like her sister, Aunt Emma, only younger and prettier, and ever so much slighter.
