25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only hope <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really {{the cause of this}} fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E
500|$|In {{a session}} of Prime Minister's Questions some weeks later, David Cameron {{challenged}} Brown to concede on record that [...] "no deals were done" [...] in ensuring {{the bill was}} passed. Brown stood before the House and said, [...] "yes". Cameron quoted from a letter written by Labour's Chief Whip Geoff Hoon to Keith Vazthe Chairman of the Home Affairs Committeein which Hoon expressed deep thanks for Vaz's support and closed the letter with the line, [...] "I trust <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> appropriately rewarded". Hoon {{said that this was}} just a joke between friends but others, such as Conservative leader David Cameron and Shadow Home Secretary David Davis viewed this letter as proof that deals were indeed done behind the scenes and that Brown lied on the record when he said there had been none. The House of Lords defeated the bill, which Lords said was [...] "fatally flawed, ill thought through and unnecessary", stating that [...] "it seeks to further erode...fundamental legal and civil rights".|$|E

On that occasion, I learnt about this faith and desired to become a Christian, but I still haven't {{accomplished}} this desire due to some small issues.

Because of that, I have sent one of my samurai, Hasekura Rokuemon, as my representative to accompany Luis Sotelo across the seas to Rome, to give you a stamp of obedience and to kiss your feet.

500|$|Robinson {{was also}} derided by {{opposing}} teams. Some, notably the St. Louis Cardinals, threatened to strike if Robinson played, {{but also to}} spread the walkout across the entire National League. Existence of the plot was leaked by the Cardinals' team physician, Robert Hyland, to a friend, the New York Herald Tribunes Rutherford [...] "Rud" [...] Rennie. The reporter, concerned about protecting Hyland's anonymity and job, in turn leaked it to his Tribune colleague and editor, Stanley Woodward, whose own subsequent reporting with other sources protected Hyland. The Woodward article made national headlines. After the threat was exposed, National League President Ford Frick and Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler {{let it be known}} that any striking players would be suspended. [...] "You will find that the friends that you think you have in the press box will not support you, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> outcasts," [...] threatened Chandler. [...] "I do not care if half the league strikes. Those who do it will encounter quick retribution. All will be suspended and I don't care if it wrecks the National League for five years. This is the United States of America and one citizen has as much right to play as another." [...] Woodward's article received the E. P. Dutton Award in 1947 for Best Sports Reporting. New York Times columnist Red Smith turned to the Cardinals' 1947 racial strike in 1977, as a spate of commemorative articles appeared on the 30th anniversary of Robinson's signing with the Dodgers. Smith remembered his old Herald Tribune colleagues' part in exposing the players' strike conspiracy. It would have succeeded, wrote Smith, [...] "…if Rud Rennie and Stanley Woodward hadn't exposed their intentions in the New York Herald Tribune." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, Youngstown State head {{football}} coach Jim Tressel took over as Buckeye head coach. Unlike his predecessor John Cooper, Tressel put a special emphasis on the rivalry. In his introductory speech at halftime of a January basketball game, against Michigan, he said [...] "I can assure you <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> proud of our young people, in the classroom, in the community, and most especially in 310 days in Ann Arbor, Michigan on the football field." [...] In his first year, Tressel registered the Buckeyes' first defeat of the Wolverines in Ann Arbor in 14 years, by a 26–20 score. Led by senior running back Jonathan Wells, the Buckeyes raced to a 23–0 halftime lead. With Wells out, Michigan mounted a second half comeback that fell just short. The next year, Tressel achieved what Cooper could not: Beating Michigan in consecutive years with a 14–9 victory. The game was decided on the last play when defensive back Will Allen intercepted a pass at the two yard line as time expired to clinch the victory. The Buckeyes were led by freshman running back Maurice Clarett, who ran for 119 yards and one touchdown. He also had a key reception to set up Maurice Hall's game-winning score. The Buckeyes {{went on to win}} the national championship that season, as they defeated Miami in the Fiesta Bowl.|$|E
2500|$|Schuck {{initially}} {{wanted to}} become an aerial reconnaissance pilot, flying the Dornier Do 17. However, due to disciplinary problems following unauthorized aerobatics on a Focke-Wulf Fw 56 [...] "Stösser" [...] and an open conflict with his commanding officer, Oberleutnant Brunner, Schuck ran {{the risk of a}} potential court-martial. To avoid further escalations Schuck was transferred to the Jagdfliegerschule (fighter pilot school) at Werneuchen. He arrived at Werneuchen on 16 June 1940 where he was assigned to the 3. Staffel (3rd squadron). The entire Gruppe was under the command of Oberleutnant Klaus Quaet-Faslem. Schuck's fighter pilot instructor was Oberfeldwebel Hobe, who was aware of Schuck's disciplinary history. Hobe commented [...] "Schuck, we don't want problems here. We now go on a test flight and I am sure <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> leaving afterwards". Fearful that this might have end his flying career, Schuck followed Hobe's every maneuver, which impressed Quaet-Faslem who had witnessed their test flight. Schuck's flying career was saved. At Werneuchen the pilots were first trained on the Messerschmitt Bf 109 B-2, later the Bf 109 E-1, which had a more powerful engine. Schuck scored more than 90% hits during target practice, the highest score then achieved at Werneuchen. After his graduation from the fighter pilot school, he was transferred to a supplementary fighter group on 2 September 1940.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was first}} rumoured that Walsh {{was about to}} make a record deal with her band's record label, Fascination Records, {{although}} nothing has been confirmed. Soon after the rumour, Walsh confirmed on Suck My Pop, a programme that she co-hosts on the digital TV station Viva, that she will feature on English rapper Aggro Santos' upcoming single, [...] "Like U Like". The track will be her first step away from Girls Aloud as a singer. Walsh was asked for OK!

Gary Barlow signed Aggro Santos and he asked me to sing Like U Like, and I've done a song for the Horrid Henry film that I'm in titled [...] "Everybody Dance".

2500|$|The {{strike and}} the {{subsequent}} Snow Riot in the District [...] exacerbated [...] long standing white fears of black workers on the navy yard. [...] In an undated diary entry for August 1835, African American diarist Michael Shiner confirms intimidation by white workers and their demand that the black caulkers stop work: [...] "Commodore Hull ishsared and evry one of them struck and said they wouldnt work anny moore {{and at the same}} time they were collered man from Baltimore by the name of Israel Jones a caulker by Trade he was the forman Caulker of those Colerded Caulkers and they where fifteen or twenty of them here at that time Caulkin on the Columbia and the Carpenters made all of them knock oft two." [...] As Michael Shiner wrote the white workers blamed Hull for bringing in black caulkers from Baltimore, Maryland and believed that black workers were to be used to break their strike. Hull's report to Dickerson shows the black caulkers did not strike. This and other incidents raised always simmering racial tension in the city and on the navy yard. White mechanics and laborers went on a three day rampage in which they threatened blacks and broke up their businesses and property. [...] On August 14, 1835, he wrote a letter to Dickerson, and expressed some apprehension for the safety of the black caulkers that he recently hired. [...] Rather than make a decision, Hull looked to the Secretary for a solution to his dilemma. [...] "Information has been conveyed to me that the Excitement which has prevailed in the City for some days past is about to be extended to the Neighborhood of the Establishment; the immediate Cause I understand is there are employed in the Yard a number of Blacks, who were in consequence of the Scarcity of Caulkers in this City brought in from Baltimore to caulk the Ship now building.Under the Circumstances I have to request <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> pleased to give me instructions, Shall I let the Blacks inside the yard and afford them such protection as the force and means at my Command will allow or shall I discharge them and afford them an opportunity to return to Baltimore?" [...] As one historian has noted, Dickerson chose to throw the black caulkers to the mob as he promptly replied, “In answer to your letter of this date, I have to observe that for the present should think it not best to admit the colored people in the Navy Yard at night.” After days of disorder and riot, President Andrew Jackson ordered a company of US Marines to restore order.|$|E
