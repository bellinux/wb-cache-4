25|$|During Bright Week—the week {{beginning}} on Pascha (Easter Sunday)—the Holy Doors remain open the entire week, and whenever the priest or deacon enter {{or leave the}} sanctuary during services <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> so through the Holy Doors. This is a practice that is unique to Bright Week. In Greek practice, the Paschal services of Bright Week are repeated on the Apodosis ("leave-taking") of Pascha—the day before Ascension—and so this practice will be repeated on this day also.|$|E
25|$|A sup (supremum) of X is a least {{upper bound}} on X, namely an upper bound on X that is less or equal to every upper bound on X. Dually an inf (infimum) of X is a {{greatest}} lower bound on X. The sup of x and y always exists in the underlying poset of a Boolean algebra, being x∨y, and likewise their inf exists, namely x∧y. The empty sup is 0 (the bottom element) and the empty inf is 1 (top). It follows that every finite set has both a sup and an inf. Infinite subsets of a Boolean algebra {{may or may not}} have a sup and/or an inf; in a power set algebra <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
500|$|After {{looking at}} agriculture, Cochrane {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} animals and genetic engineering. The question of whether an animal has a right not to be genetically engineered, he suggests, makes no sense, as live animals are not engineered, and embryos have no interests, so cannot have rights. Instead, Cochrane considers whether animals have a right {{not to have been}} engineered, arguing {{that it is not the}} case that <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>do,</b> and that if [...] "genetic engineering gives the animals lives with opportunities for well-being that are similar to or better than ordinary members of their species, then it is ordinarily permissible." [...] Cochrane then addresses four reasons to oppose this claim; first, the notion that genetic engineering instrumentalizes animals, second, the idea that genetic engineering is repugnant, third, that genetic engineering reveals a flaw in character (see virtue ethics) and fourth, that genetic engineering denies the dignity of animals. Cochrane finds none of these arguments reason to abandon the principle. Cochrane considers whether animals may ever have a right not to have been engineered. He argues that animals have a right not to be engineered such that they have lives not worth living. He then rejects some reasons for believing that animals have a right not to be engineered with diseases or disabilities, but concludes that they do, as engineered animals have an interest [...] "in having been engineered with sufficient opportunities for well-being", an interest which is strong enough to ground a concrete right. However, Cochrane argues that he is not advocating perfectionism, as he is concerned not with equal capacities between members of a species, but equal opportunities for well-being. Finally, Cochrane considers the possibility of engineering nonsentient, non-conscious livestock, arguing that, ordinarily, there is no wrong in engineering nonconscious entities.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} make a {{faithful}} rendition of the circus, director Kramer asked the animators to watch a showing of Cirque du Soleil in Santa Monica, but they declined the offer. Regardless, executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully found that the animators did an [...] "amazing" [...] job animating the setpiece. Because the episode takes place in winter, the animators faced some challenges that they would not have with any other episode. [...] "It just adds another element", Kramer said about episodes taking place in winter, [...] "People's clothes have to get tugged in the wind if it's windy. And {{you have to make sure}} the snow is consistent because [...] It's like a character. If it's a big snowflake in one scene and then tiny ones where it's snowing too hard in the next scene... It's not gonna work." [...] The scratches and bad quality of [...] "The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was" [...] were added in by the Post-Production Department, led by Alex Duke. [...] "Our Post-Production Department never gets enough credit," [...] Scully said, [...] "But they'll take a film like [...] and make it all scratchy and make it look really old. <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> a great job." [...] The woman in [...] "The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was" [...] was portrayed by Tress MacNeille, while the clown in the Cirque du Purée was voiced by Hank Azaria. The song that plays when Homer and Ned are driving to the school is [...] "Feel Like Makin' Love" [...] by English rock band Bad Company. Originally, the series' staff wanted to use [...] "Rock and Roll All Nite" [...] by American rock band Kiss, but they failed to obtain the rights to use it.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 February 2016, it was {{confirmed}} that Westbrook would reprise the role {{for a few}} episodes. Her return will coincide with Kemp's return as Sam's brother Grant and Windsor's final appearance as Sam's mother Peggy. Of her return Westbrook said, 'I'm really excited to be going back to EastEnders". Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said: [...] "It is only right that all of Peggy Mitchell's children would be at her funeral. Danniella is the final piece of the Mitchell jigsaw puzzle, so it will be great for viewers to see Phil, Grant and Sam all back on screen. Sam will only be back for a few episodes, but these scenes are bound to go down in the soap's history." [...] While appearing on an episode of Loose Women on 24 March 2016, Westbrook expressed interest in reprising the role of Sam on a full-time basis. Westbrook returned to filming on 3 May 2016. Letitia Dean who plays Sharon Watts revealed that there would be [...] "fireworks" [...] when Sam returns. Dean revealed: [...] "Sam coming back is a shock. It's obviously {{been a long time since}} anyone has seen her and she is trouble through and through. But Peggy is her mum, so of course she had to be there for the funeral". She went on to say: [...] "They do have a bit of a run-in with each other and Sharon is caught out which really panics her, especially that Sam has come back and seems to be unhappy that Sharon is so involved with the Mitchells." [...] Westbrook later expressed her disappointment with Sam only appearing in four episodes in an Instagram post. [...] "It's such a shame I won't be going back to the show as I think people would of [...] loved to see Sam as a mum and with a different take on the character… But I don't write the show I just do what they tell me," [...] Westbrook went on to say: [...] "And they've done what <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> use Sam when she's needed & then send her off in a black cab. I wish @bbceastenders would listen to the public more. But either way I'm grateful of the 4 episodes I got to film." [...] Her return scenes aired on 30 June with her final scenes aired on 8 July 2016. In March 2017, Westbrook expressed interest in reprising her role as Sam but feared the show would just use her for publicity. On 11 May 2017, Westbrook claimed during an interview on Loose Women that she would be reprising her role as Sam later in the year, however an EastEnders source denied this, saying, [...] "There are no plans for Danniella to return, it's just not going to happen. It's very odd that she keeps harping on about her return to the soap cause it has plainly never been discussed." ...|$|E
