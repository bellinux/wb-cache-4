40|$|<b>Track</b> <b>irregularity</b> is {{increased}} by loads of trains and deformation of structures. Since <b>track</b> <b>irregularity</b> affects ride comfort and running safety of trains, we measure <b>track</b> <b>irregularity</b> to align the tracks upon evaluation with appropriate indicators. We call this work track management. In general, the more speed increases, the more <b>track</b> <b>irregularity</b> of longer wavelength affects ride comfort and running safety. With {{the increase of}} operational speed {{by the introduction of}} new high-speed cars, we accordingly examined whether the present track management indicators could be used for the evaluation of ride quality or new indicators that could represent better the effect of <b>track</b> <b>irregularity</b> of longer wavelength would be required. The running tests of FASTECH 360, which is equipped with lateral vibration controllers (active suspension) on bogies, confirmed improvement of ride comfort by more than a few dB compared to an actual train running at 275 km/h (without vibration controllers). Based on those test results, we considered that the present track condition can sufficiently provide good ride comfort in terms of lateral vibration; so, we studied vertical vibration. First, we compared the <b>track</b> <b>irregularity</b> measurement results measured with 40 m-chord, 60 m-chord and 80 m-chord versine methods to the waveforms of vertical vibration acceleration of cars (with and without ride comfort adjustment). Next, we obtained the response of car body vibration acceleration through frequency analysis and compared it to the measured magnification of the present track management indicator. And also, by simulating track maintenance, we compared improvements in ride comfort per track maintenance length. Finally, we carried out actual 40 m-chord track maintenance to understand the improvement in ride comfort. In order to make appropriate track management for ride quality, we {{have to pay attention to}} the following. * Relationship between ride quality and vibration acceleration of cars * Relationship between vibration acceleration of cars and <b>track</b> <b>irregularity</b> * Relationship between <b>track</b> <b>irregularity</b> and <b>track</b> management indicator...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to verify the {{simulated}} wheel-rail forces from the simulation soft-ware Simpack {{by comparing the results}} with on-track measurements. The report constitutes a literature study on wheel-rail contact modelling and techniques for measurements of track forces and <b>track</b> <b>irregularities.</b> Furthermore, it describes the veriﬁcation procedure itself and how the model was set up, and subsequently presents the results from the actual comparisons. Three versions of Simpack have been compared that utilize diﬀerent types of contact models. Investigations on alternative ways of ﬁltering <b>track</b> <b>irregularities</b> were conducted, and how the simulated forces were inﬂuenced by using worn wheel and rail proﬁles was also studied. The method was to realistically model the track sections in nine test cases with varying curve radii, considering the nominal track geometry and <b>track</b> <b>irregularities.</b> A vehicle model for the Regina 250 train was used for the simulations, which were then compared with the correspond-ing on-track measurements. Time histories and frequency contents were compared. It was found that the simulated wheel-rail forces correspond well to the measurements, at least for frequencies up to 5 - 10 Hz, and that no considerable deviations could be found when comparing the contact models. However, the simulation times diﬀered and the discrete contact model introduced in Simpack 9. 8 was particularly time demanding. The results shows that it is beneﬁcial to ﬁlter the <b>track</b> <b>irregularities</b> before conducting simula-tions, since it saves simulation time while retaining an adequate accuracy of the track forces. The use of worn wheel and rail proﬁles could in this report not be shown to have any ma-jor impact on the wheel-rail forces, which is in contradiction with the hypothesis.
