5|$|A {{series of}} biotic and abiotic cues, such as {{individual}} genetics, foraging quantity and quality, or population density, may trigger the maturation of the reproductive organs {{and the production}} of gametes and <b>thus</b> determine sexual maturity. Like many reptiles, all marine turtles of a same aggregation are highly unlikely to reach sexual maturity at the same size and <b>thus</b> age.|$|E
5|$|Alexander had {{surrounded}} the Sacred Band, {{who refused to}} move and were <b>thus</b> annihilated.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam, {{like other}} benzodiazepines, binds to {{specific}} {{sites on the}} GABAA (gamma-amino-butyric acid) receptor. When bound to these sites, which {{are referred to as}} benzodiazepine receptors, it modulates the effect of GABAA receptors and, <b>thus,</b> of GABAergic neurons. Long-term use causes adaptive changes in the benzodiazepine receptors, making them less sensitive to stimulation and <b>thus</b> making the drugs less potent.|$|E
5|$|Although Christ, like man, {{is made in}} {{the image}} of God, he alone shares the {{likeness}} of God the Father. Christ is both sinless and apathetic, and <b>thus</b> by striving to imitate Christ, man can achieve salvation. To Clement, sin is involuntary, and <b>thus</b> irrational , removed only through the wisdom of the Logos. God's guidance of us away from sin is <b>thus</b> a manifestation of God's universal love for mankind. The word play on λόγος and αλόγον is characteristic of Clement's writing, and may be rooted in the Epicurean belief that relationships between words are deeply reflective of relationships between the objects they signify.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids do {{not possess}} photophores, and are <b>thus</b> not truly bioluminescent.|$|E
5|$|Club Brugge gained {{entry to}} the {{competition}} by winning the 1976–77 Belgian First Division and <b>thus</b> becoming Belgian champions. Their opponents {{in the first round}} were the Finnish champions, Kuopion Palloseura (KuPS). Brugge won the first leg 4–0 at KuPS's home ground, the Kuopion keskuskenttä, and the second leg 5–2 at Brugge's ground, the Jan Breydel Stadium, <b>thus</b> winning the round 9–2 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Complete {{figures for}} the Georgian Cup are {{unavailable}} and <b>thus</b> excluded.|$|E
5|$|Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and <b>thus</b> reduce {{glucagon}} {{and blood}} glucose levels.|$|E
5|$|Every {{new term}} greater than million is one million {{times larger than}} the {{previous}} term. <b>Thus,</b> billion means a millionmillions (1012), trillion means a millionbillions (1018), and so on. <b>Thus,</b> an n-illion equals 106n.|$|E
5|$|He is also <b>thus</b> far {{the most}} recent Frenchman to win his home Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|He <b>thus</b> very {{accurately}} {{described the}} four years of war to come.|$|E
5|$|Howell Road {{was never}} given access from Route 33 {{eastbound}} and <b>thus</b> the ramp still remains barricaded off, slowly decaying.|$|E
5|$|Inchgarvie (part of Forth Bridge), <b>thus</b> {{joined to}} both Fife and Lothian on the Mainland.|$|E
5|$|It {{was through}} this gap Alexander and the cavalry charged. He <b>thus</b> {{made the first}} break in the line.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-11 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 14.2, and <b>thus</b> cannot {{be seen with}} the naked eye.|$|E
5|$|On this site, 171 {{plant species}} are surveyed. Given {{its size and}} poor soil, this {{diversity}} is notable. Management undertaken {{in recent years has}} been essential to maintaining open areas, the most threatened by primary succession. <b>Thus,</b> the various vegetation layers (pioneer and mature woodland, bushy areas, open areas) provide a mosaic of habitats, and <b>thus</b> remarkable species.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to {{plans that}} would result in an {{increase}} in traffic at Sydney Airport, and <b>thus</b> more aircraft noise.|$|E
5|$|Recruitment was <b>thus</b> heavy {{throughout}} the Augustan period, {{with a steady}} {{increase in the number}} of units formed. By AD 23, the Roman historian Tacitus records that there were roughly the same numbers of auxiliaries in service as there were legionaries. Since at this time there were 25 legions of c. 5,000 men each, the Auxilia <b>thus</b> amounted to c. 125,000 men, implying c. 250 auxiliary regiments.|$|E
5|$|Reno was {{unanimously}} {{confirmed by}} the Senate on March 11, 1993, and <b>thus</b> became the first female Attorney General.|$|E
5|$|Sailors <b>thus</b> {{believed}} that all blue men have names {{by which they}} address each other.|$|E
5|$|Sebastian {{was absent}} on the live results show, but present through live telecast, <b>thus</b> {{eligible}} to vote.|$|E
5|$|Some brachiopods do {{not have}} a {{functional}} pedicle, and <b>thus</b> {{do not have}} this pedicle opening.|$|E
5|$|Some {{put forth}} that this intermixing of species {{is against the}} teachings of the Talmud and <b>thus</b> against Jewish Law and nonkosher. Others argue that the one in sixty parts law of kashrut is of significance, and that the foreign gene {{accounts}} for the less than 1/60 of the animal and <b>thus</b> the modified salmon is kosher.|$|E
5|$|Song has no rhythm guitar or bass guitar track {{included}} and, <b>thus,</b> {{cannot be}} played in any co-operative mode.|$|E
5|$|The Atharvaveda credits {{him of the}} {{invention}} of ploughing and <b>thus,</b> agriculture. He is also described as one who flattened the Earth's rocky surface, <b>thus</b> encouraging agriculture, cattle-breeding, commerce and development of new cities on earth. In a hymn in Rigveda, Prithu {{is described as a}} rishi (seer). D. R. Patil suggests that the Rigvedic Prithu was a vegetarian deity, associated with Greek god Dionysus and another Vedic god Soma.|$|E
5|$|The D± signals used by low, full, {{and high}} speed are carried over a twisted pair (typically, unshielded) to reduce noise and crosstalk. SuperSpeed uses {{separate}} transmit and receive differential pairs, which additionally require shielding (typically, {{shielded twisted pair}} but twinax is also mentioned by the specification). <b>Thus,</b> to support SuperSpeed data transmission, cables contain twice as many wires and are <b>thus</b> larger in diameter.|$|E
5|$|The Jain karmic theory, <b>thus</b> {{speaks of}} great powers of soul to {{manipulate}} the karmas by its actions.|$|E
5|$|The Upanishad's {{structure}} is notable as it embeds key parts of verses from early Principal Upanishads, <b>thus</b> referencing them and yet building its own message. The fragments of earlier major Upanishads it <b>thus</b> integrates within it, include Mundaka Upanishad and Shvetashvatara Upanishad.|$|E
5|$|The {{birth of}} Prithu is without female intervention. <b>Thus</b> being a ayonija ("born without (the participation) of the yoni"), Prithu is {{untouched}} by desire and ego and can <b>thus</b> control his senses to rule dutifully upholding Dharma.|$|E
5|$|The {{eccentricity}} of {{an orbit}} describes how elongated a planet's orbit is. Planets with low eccentricities have more circular orbits, whereas planets with high eccentricities have more elliptical orbits. The planets in the Solar System have very low eccentricities, and <b>thus</b> nearly circular orbits. Comets and Kuiper belt objects (as {{well as several}} extrasolar planets) have very high eccentricities, and <b>thus</b> exceedingly elliptical orbits.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} <b>thus</b> {{ends with}} the lower strings, and the piano (briefly recalling the second section of the movement).|$|E
5|$|The {{panels are}} <b>thus</b> tied {{into the earth}} {{embankment}} to make a stable structure with balanced stresses.|$|E
5|$|The school {{moved to}} four houses in 1979, from primary to secondary, and <b>thus</b> the junior houses disappeared.|$|E
5|$|The {{site is a}} {{scheduled}} monument, and <b>thus</b> accorded legal protection under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.|$|E
5|$|The {{symmetry}} of defects in crystals {{is described by}} the point groups. They differ from the space groups describing the {{symmetry of}} crystals by absence of translations, and <b>thus</b> are much fewer in number. In diamond, only defects of the following symmetries have been observed <b>thus</b> far: tetrahedral (Td), tetragonal (D2d), trigonal (D3d,C3v), rhombic (C2v), monoclinic (C2h, C1h, C2) and triclinic (C1 or CS).|$|E
5|$|These {{schools were}} <b>thus</b> {{similar to the}} LEA-maintained Roman Catholic grammar schools, whom they outnumbered.|$|E
