5|$|After the marriage, Ramanujan {{developed}} a hydrocele <b>testis.</b> The condition could {{be treated with}} a routine surgical operation that would release the blocked fluid in the scrotal sac, but his family {{did not have the}} money for the operation. In January 1910, a doctor volunteered to do the surgery at no cost.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{there are}} two other isoforms of the {{catalytic}} subunit of PKA called Cβ and Cγ arising from different genes but have similar functions as Cα. Cβ is found abundantly in the brain and in lower levels in other tissues, while Cγ is most likely expressed in the <b>testis.</b>|$|E
5|$|In males, the semen {{is forming}} in the <b>testis.</b> The sperm {{structure}} of Theodoxus fluviatilis was examined by Gustaf Retzius. Then semen travels through the prostate, where it mixes with prostatic fluid. Finally {{it goes through}} the vas deferens to the penis. The penis {{is located on the}} inner side of the right tentacle.|$|E
5|$|In mammals, sexual {{differentiation}} {{is determined}} by the sperm that carries either an X or a Y (male) chromosome. The Y chromosome contains a sex-determining gene (SRY) that encodes a transcription factor for the protein tdf (<b>testis</b> determining factor) and triggers the creation of testosterone and Anti-Müllerian hormone for the embryo's development into a male. This differentiation begins about eight or nine weeks after conception. Some sources state that it continues until the twelfth week, while others state that it is clearly evident by the thirteenth week and that the sex organs are fully developed by the sixteenth week.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses are gonochoric {{and have}} a single, posteriorly-located gonad which is {{associated}} with the coelom. The <b>testis</b> in males and the ovary in females bulges into the gonocoel and the gametes are released here. The gonocoel is connected by the gonoduct to the mantle cavity, which it enters at the gonopore. An optic gland creates hormones that cause the octopus to mature and age and stimulate gamete production. The gland may be triggered by environmental conditions such as temperature, light and nutrition, which thus control the timing of reproduction and lifespan.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction {{is one of}} the {{few times}} the Sunda slow loris {{aggregates}} with conspecifics, as it is largely solitary. One study recorded that the most slow lorises ever seen together was six; this appeared to be a female in estrus and five males following her. This may suggest a more promiscuous mating system, where females mate with more than one male. Despite this, its <b>testis</b> size is small compared with similar sized promsimians, which is indicative of monogamy. In the wild the mating system of the Sunda slow loris is thought to vary between populations.|$|E
5|$|For males, the {{reproductive}} {{system is the}} <b>testis,</b> suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct {{that leads to the}} outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or spermatogonia, which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Spermatocytic seminoma is a {{neoplasm}} of the <b>testis</b> (i.e. a tumour of the <b>testis),</b> and {{classified as}} a germ cell tumour.|$|E
25|$|The risk of {{malignancy}} in the undescended <b>testis</b> is 4 to 10 {{times higher}} than that {{in the general population}} and is approximately 1 in 80 with a unilateral undescended <b>testis</b> and 1 in 40 to 1 in 50 for bilateral undescended testes. The peak age for this tumor is 15–45 yr. The most common tumor developing in an undescended <b>testis</b> is a seminoma (65%); in contrast, after orchiopexy, seminomas represent only 30% of <b>testis</b> tumors.|$|E
25|$|The {{periphery}} of the testes are converted into the tunica albuginea. Cords of the central mass run together and form a network which becomes the rete <b>testis,</b> and another network, which develops the seminiferous tubules. Via the rete <b>testis,</b> the seminiferous tubules become connected with outgrowths from the mesonephros, which form the efferent ducts of the <b>testis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} major {{complication of}} all types of orchiopexy is a loss of the blood supply to the <b>testis,</b> resulting in loss of the <b>testis</b> due to ischemic atrophy or fibrosis.|$|E
25|$|In short, {{the descent}} of the testes {{consists}} of {{the opening of a}} connection from the <b>testis</b> to its final location at the anterior abdominal wall, followed by the development of the gubernaculum, which subsequently pulls and translocates the <b>testis</b> down into the developing scrotum. Ultimately, the passageway closes behind the <b>testis.</b> A failure in this process can cause indirect inguinal hernia or an infantile hydrocoele.|$|E
25|$|In {{species that}} have {{external}} testes (such as humans), the artery to the <b>testis</b> {{is surrounded by}} a mesh of veins called the pampiniform plexus. This cools the blood heading to the <b>testis,</b> while reheating the returning blood.|$|E
25|$|The <b>testis</b> has {{collateral}} {{blood supply}} from 1. the cremasteric artery (a {{branch of the}} inferior epigastric artery, which is {{a branch of the}} external iliac artery), and 2. the artery to the ductus deferens (a branch of the inferior vesical artery, which is a branch of the internal iliac artery). Therefore, if the testicular artery is ligated, e.g., during a Fowler-Stevens orchiopexy for a high undescended <b>testis,</b> the <b>testis</b> will usually survive on these other blood supplies.|$|E
25|$|Mauris est pestis, fuit Vrgi postea <b>testis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{diagnostic}} dilemma in otherwise normal boys is distinguishing a retractile <b>testis</b> from a <b>testis</b> {{that will not}} descend spontaneously into the scrotum. Retractile testes are more common than truly undescended testes and {{do not need to}} be operated on. In normal males, as the cremaster muscle relaxes or contracts, the <b>testis</b> moves lower or higher ("retracts") in the scrotum. This cremasteric reflex is much more active in infant boys than older men. A retractile <b>testis</b> high in the scrotum can be difficult to distinguish from a position in the lower inguinal canal. Though there are various maneuvers used to do so, such as using a cross-legged position, soaping the examiner's fingers, or examining in a warm bath, the benefit of surgery in these cases can be a matter of clinical judgment.|$|E
25|$|Stage I: {{the cancer}} remains {{localized}} to the <b>testis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Endocrine {{disorders}} {{can also}} affect {{the size and}} function of the <b>testis.</b>|$|E
25|$|When the <b>testis</b> {{is in the}} abdomen, {{the first}} stage of surgery is {{exploration}} to locate it, assess its viability, and determine the safest way to maintain or establish the blood supply. Multi-stage surgeries, or autotransplantation and anastomosis, are more often necessary in these situations. Just as often, intra-abdominal exploration discovers that the <b>testis</b> is non-existent ("vanished"), or dysplastic and not salvageable.|$|E
25|$|Testicular torsion is {{a medical}} emergency. Treatment within 4–6 hours of onset can prevent {{necrosis}} of the <b>testis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The initial {{treatment}} for testicular cancer is {{surgery to remove}} the affected testicle (orchiectomy). While it may be possible, in some cases, to remove testicular cancer tumors from a <b>testis</b> while leaving the <b>testis</b> functional, this is almost never done, as the affected testicle usually contains pre-cancerous cells spread throughout the entire testicle. Thus removing the tumor alone without additional treatment greatly increases the risk that another cancer will form in that testicle.|$|E
25|$|Stage II: {{the cancer}} {{involves}} the <b>testis</b> and metastasis to retroperitoneal and/or paraaortic lymph nodes (lymph nodes below the diaphragm).|$|E
25|$|Reproductive system: <b>Testis</b> {{is large}} (1.75 whorls), {{composed}} of compound lobes, broadly overlapping stomach anteriorly. Seminal vesicle is opening near anterior edge of <b>testis,</b> {{composed of a}} few thickened coils, positioned along ventral side of anterior 33% of <b>testis.</b> Prostate gland is small, pea-shaped, with about 50% of length in pallial roof. Anterior vas deferens opening from antero-ventral edge of prostate gland, section of duct on columellar muscle straight. Penis is large, base rectangular, inner edge without folds. Penial filament is short, narrow, tapering, oblique. Lobe is rather medium-sized, squarish, oblique. Terminal gland is narrow, usually transversely positioned along outer edge of lobe, less frequently horizontal, sometimes borne on short stalk. Penial duct is narrow, near outer edge, almost straight. Penial filament has black internal pigment core along most of length.|$|E
25|$|Germ cell {{tumors of the}} <b>testis</b> are {{the most}} common cancer in young men between the ages of 15 and 35 years.|$|E

25|$|In {{surgical}} sperm retrieval (SSR) {{the reproductive}} urologist obtains sperm from the vas deferens, epididymis or {{directly from the}} <b>testis</b> in a short outpatient procedure.|$|E
25|$|Cryptorchidism is {{distinct}} from monorchism, the condition of having only one testicle. The condition may occur on one or both sides; it more commonly affects the right <b>testis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of {{testicular}} cancer occurring in undescended testes is seminoma. It is usually treatable if caught early, so urologists often recommend that boys who had orchiopexy as infants be taught testicular self-examination, to recognize testicular masses and seek early medical care for them. Cancer developing in an intra-abdominal <b>testis</b> would be unlikely to be recognized before considerable growth and spread, and {{one of the advantages of}} orchiopexy is that a mass developing in a scrotal <b>testis</b> is far easier to recognize than an intra-abdominal mass.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the strongest}} {{arguments}} for early orchiopexy is {{reducing the risk of}} testicular cancer. About 1 in 500 men born with one or both testes undescended develops testicular cancer, roughly a 4 to 40 fold increased risk. The peak incidence occurs in the 3rd and 4th decades of life. The risk is higher for intra-abdominal testes and somewhat lower for inguinal testes, but even the normally descended <b>testis</b> of a man whose other <b>testis</b> was undescended has about a 20% higher cancer risk than those of other men.|$|E
25|$|Transplant of {{a single}} gonad (<b>testis)</b> from a living donor {{was carried out in}} early July 1926 in Zaječar, Serbia, by a Russian émigré surgeon Dr. Peter Vasil'evič Kolesnikov. The donor was a convicted murderer, one Ilija Krajan, whose death {{sentence}} was commuted to 20 years imprisonment, and he was led to believe that it was done because he had donated his <b>testis</b> to an elderly medical doctor. Both the donor and the receiver survived, but charges were brought {{in a court of law}} by the public prosecutor against Dr. Kolesnikov, not for performing the operation, but for lying to the donor.|$|E
25|$|Other {{signs and}} symptom may include haematuria; loin pain; {{abdominal}} mass; malaise, {{which is a}} general feeling of unwellness; weight loss and/or loss of appetite; anaemia resulting from depression of erythropoietin; erythrocytosis (increased production of red blood cells) due to increased erythropoietin secretion; varicocele, which is seen in males as an enlargement of the pampiniform plexus of veins draining the <b>testis</b> (more often the left <b>testis)</b> hypertension (high blood pressure) resulting from secretion of renin by the tumour; hypercalcemia, which is elevation of calcium levels in the blood; sleep disturbance or night sweats; recurrent fevers; and chronic fatigue.|$|E
25|$|Testicular rupture is {{a medical}} {{emergency}} caused by blunt force impact, sharp edge, or piercing impact to one or both testicles, {{which can lead to}} necrosis of the <b>testis</b> in as little as 30 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Injection {{of sperm}} antigens causes {{inflammation}} of the <b>testis</b> (auto-immune orchitis) and reduced fertility. Thus, the blood–testis barrier may reduce the likelihood that sperm proteins will induce an immune response, reducing fertility and so progeny.|$|E
25|$|Not all lumps on the {{testicles}} are tumors, {{and not all}} {{tumors are}} cancer. There are many other conditions, such as testicular microlithiasis, epididymal cysts, and appendix <b>testis</b> (hydatid of Morgagni), which may be painful but are non-cancerous.|$|E
25|$|In {{the male}} the Müllerian ducts atrophy, but traces of their {{anterior}} ends {{are represented by}} the appendices <b>testis</b> (hydatids of Morgagni of the male), while their terminal fused portions form the utriculus in {{the floor of the}} prostatic urethra.|$|E
25|$|Males do {{not possess}} these organs, but instead have a large <b>testis</b> {{in place of the}} ovary, and a spermatophoric gland and sac. In mature males, this sac may contain spermatophores, which are placed inside the female's mantle during mating.|$|E
