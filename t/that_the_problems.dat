5|$|A major {{reform to}} the Court {{happened}} {{soon after the}} restoration, {{with the introduction of}} a right of appeal to the House of Lords from the Chancery. Before this there had been no records of appeals to the Lords, and a committee had concluded that there was no precedent to give the Lords jurisdiction over equity matters, except when problems and cases were sent directly to Parliament (as occasionally had been the case). In 1660 the Convention Parliament claimed for itself the right of appellate jurisdiction over equity matters, and also the right of original jurisdiction to hear equity cases at first instance. After disputes which lasted into the next Parliament, this second measure was dropped, but the right to hear equity appeals was confirmed. Horowitz writes that despite these changes, one of the academic certainties is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> which had dogged the court for the last two centuries persisted; Observations on the Dilatory and Expensive Proceedings in the Court of Chancery, written in 1701, listed 25 different procedures, areas and situations which contributed to the problems of high fees and slow processes.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Edmonton in 1982 and {{learning of the}} lead-level findings from the 1981 expedition, Beattie struggled to find a cause. Possibilities included the lead solder used to seal the expedition's food tins, other food containers lined with lead foil, food colouring, tobacco products, pewter tableware, and lead-wicked candles. He came to suspect <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> of lead poisoning compounded by the effects of scurvy could have been lethal for the Franklin crew. However, because skeletal lead might reflect lifetime exposure rather than exposure limited to the voyage, Beattie's theory could be tested only by forensic examination of preserved soft tissue as opposed to bone. Beattie decided to examine the graves of the buried crewmen on Beechey Island.|$|E
5|$|Although this species' {{population}} {{now appears}} to be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers, this petrel is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern. The perceived decline may be due increased predation from gulls, skuas and introduced mammals. Eradication of rats protects seabird colonies and may enable recolonisation of islands cleared of rodents. Predation of cave-nesting petrels in the Balearics by yellow-legged gulls is restricted to relatively few individual gulls specialising in this prey item; this means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> can be controlled by selective culling and the provision of plastic nest boxes.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the mostly}} {{negative}} reception, Game Informer and Dave Halverson of Play Magazine defended the game. Game Informer {{described it as}} ambitious and praised the graphics, story, amount of content, and replay value, though the publication still believed that only fans of the franchise would enjoy the game. Halverson initially gave the Xbox360 version a 9.5/10, praising each character's controls and abilities and calling it the best 3D Sonic game yet. In the following issue, Halverson reassessed it as 8.5/10, writing {{that he had been}} told that the load times and glitches in his review copy would not be in {{the final version of the}} game. In a later review of the PlayStation3 version, Halverson was frustrated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> had still not been corrected and that the performance was worse despite the extra development time; Halverson gave the PS3 version a 5.5/10.|$|E

The {{only part of the}} service which was profitable was the service from Stockholm to Karlstad, which SJ intended to continue. NSB stated that if a new Oslo–Stockholm service was to be introduced, it would require state grants. In September, SJ's CEO Jan Forsberg stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> lay with the infrastructure in Norway. While the speeds were high enough to operate with a profit in Sweden and to Copenhagen, the slow lines in Norway made services to Norway unprofitable. Linx had by then transported 1.3 million passengers, and Forsberg stated that had the company transported 1.7 million people, it would have been profitable.|$|E

When Juliet tells him that nothing else can be done and asks {{to go home and}} be with her sister, Ben informs Juliet that her sister's cancer has come back. He offers her a choice: either Juliet can go home and be with her sister as she dies, or she can stay and he will have Jacob cure her sister's cancer.|$|E
5|$|The British public {{first saw}} the Spitfire at the RAF Hendon air-display on Saturday 27 June 1936. Although {{full-scale}} production was supposed to begin immediately, there were numerous problems {{that could not be}} overcome for some time, and the first production Spitfire, K9787, did not roll off the Woolston, Southampton assembly line until mid-1938. The first and most immediate problem was that the main Supermarine factory at Woolston was already working at full capacity fulfilling orders for Walrus and Stranraer flying boats. Although outside contractors were supposed to be involved in manufacturing many important Spitfire components, especially the wings, Vickers-Armstrong (the parent company) was reluctant to see the Spitfire being manufactured by outside concerns, and was slow to release the necessary blueprints and subcomponents. As a result of the delays in getting the Spitfire into full production, the Air Ministry put forward a plan that production of the Spitfire be stopped after the initial order for 310, after which Supermarine would build Bristol Beaufighters. The managements of Supermarine and Vickers were able to convince the Air Ministry <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> could be overcome, and further orders were placed for 200 Spitfires on 24 March 1938. The two orders covered the K, L and N prefix serial numbers.|$|E
40|$|The {{imposition}} of general disjunctions {{of the form}} “πx ≤ π 0 ∨ πx ≥ π 0 + 1 ”, where π,π 0 are integer valued, is a fundamental operation in both the branch-and-bound and cuttingplane algorithms for solving mixed integer linear programs. Such disjunctions {{can be used for}} branching at each iteration of the branch-and-bound algorithm or to generate split inequalities for the cutting-plane algorithm. We first consider <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of selecting a general disjunction and show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of selecting an optimal such disjunction, according to specific criteria described herein, is N P-hard. We further show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> remains N P-hard even for binary programs or when considering certain restricted classes of disjunctions. We observe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of deciding whether a given inequality is a split inequality can be reduced to one of <b>the</b> above <b>problems,</b> which leads to a proof <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> is N P-complete. ...|$|R

Mergentime/Perini Joint Venture, the contractor working on the stations, had violated its contract with WMATA by reducing the workforce on the project, not meeting project deadlines, and permitting unsafe working conditions to persist. Mergentime/Perini denied the accusations. Although similar problems plagued Mergentime/Perini's work on the Navy Yard station, WMATA did not fire the joint venture company from that project.
