40|$|International audienceTropilaelaps mite {{samples were}} {{collected}} from 72 locations in 25 provinces throughout China. The mitochondrial DNA cox 1 and ribosomal ITS 1 - 5. 8 S-ITS 2 fragments of Tropilaelaps mites were surveyed for sequence variation or {{the presence or absence}} of specific restriction sites that differentiate four species of <b>Tropilaelaps</b> <b>mite</b> (Tropilaelaps clareae, Tropilaelaps mercedesae, Tropilaelaps koenigerum, and Tropilaelaps thaii). Based on these identified diagnostic characters, all samples in this study corresponded to T. mercedesae, which has been mistaken for T. clareae until now. None of the other Tropilaelaps species were found infesting Apis mellifera in China. A total of 73 cox 1 haplotypes and 104 ITS 1 - 5. 8 S-ITS 2 haplotypes were discovered in this study. Haplotype analysis revealed that there is no association between geographic distance and genetic distance among populations. The results of the present study clarified the taxonomic status and biogeography of Tropilaelaps mites in China, and should have implications for the control and bee quarantine efforts in China...|$|E

At the same time, {{it should be noted that}} morbidity bees, has a negative impact on the number of population of bee colonies in Slovakia but also on agricultural production and the environment (rapid reduction of pollinated plants and the consequent reduction in crop yields per hectare). American foulbrood, European foulbrood, Varroa mite, Tracheal mite, <b>Tropilaelaps</b> <b>mite</b> and Small hive beetle are the diseases (possibly pests of bees), causing huge financial losses due to the death of bee colonies. The greatest risk of health issues hives is the use of medications in the prevetion and treatment of dangerous diseases of bees and bee brood. While at the national level and at EU can not use antibiotics and sulfonamides or in the prevention and even treatment, in many other countries in the world it is common practice the use of these drugs in beehives. Subsequent import of honey from these countries to the EU are at risk of honeys on the market for residues of antibiotics and sulfonamides. The situation is different when using acaricidal drugs to control Varroa mite, because treatment is mandatory and necessary to maintain relatively good health bee colonies. However, there are also the occurrence of residues acaricidal substances in honey, which is only set MRLs for amitraz and tau-fluvalinate (substances used in the Slovak Republic). By using these products is a risk of their residues in honey consumption and the risk of end-users...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{aspects of the}} two known brood parasites of honey bees from Asia, namely the {{tropical}} bee <b>mites</b> <b>Tropilaelaps</b> clareae Delfinado et Baker and Tropilaelaps koenigerum Delfinado-Baker et Baker. These species of Tropilaelaps belong to the family Laelapidae (Mesostigmata). They feed on bee larvae and pupae causing brood malformation {{and the death of}} bees. T. clareae occurs on 5 species of bee- Apis cerana, A. dorsata, A. florea, A. laboriosa and A. mellifera. T. clareae is known to have a wide disribution in Asia extending eastwards from Iran to Papua New Guinea. T. koenigerum on the other hand and as far as is known at present, has a more restricted distribution. Because of the great interest in Varroa {{and to a lesser extent}} Acarapis woodi Rennie, the importance of <b>Tropilaelaps</b> <b>mites</b> has not been sufficiently recognised. There is some concern that Tropilaelaps may become established on A. mellifera in temperate climates. <b>Tropilaelaps</b> <b>mites</b> therefore are an important potential threat to beekeeping in parts of the world other than South-East Asia...|$|R
40|$|At {{least two}} {{parasitic}} mites {{have moved from}} Asian species of honeybees to infest Apis mellifera. Of these two, Varroa destructor is more widespread globally while Tropilaelaps mercedesae has remained largely in Asia. <b>Tropilaelaps</b> <b>mites</b> are most problematic when A. mellifera is managed outside its native range in contact with Asian species of Apis. In areas where this occurs, beekeepers of A. mellifera treat aggressively for Tropilaelaps and Varroa is either outcompeted or is controlled {{as a result of}} the aggressive treatment regime used against <b>Tropilaelaps.</b> Many <b>mite</b> control products used worldwide may in fact control both mites but environmental conditions differ globally and thus a control product that works well in one area may be less or ineffective in other areas. This is especially true of volatile compounds. In the current research we tested several commercial products known to control Varroa and powdered sulfur for efficacy against Tropilaelaps. Additionally, we tested the cultural control method of making a hive division to reduce Tropilaelaps growth in both the parent and offspring colony. Making a split or nucleus colony significantly reduced mite population in both the parent and nucleus colony when compared to un-manipulated control colonies. The formic acid product, Mite-Away Quick Strips®, was the only commercial product that significantly reduced mite population 8 weeks after initiation of treatment without side effects. Sulfur also reduced mite populations but both sulfur and Hopguard® significantly impacted colony growth by reducing adult bee populations. Apivar® (amitraz) strips had no effect on mite or adult bee populations under the conditions tested...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the debris}} of five Apis dorsata colonies at a single site in Sabah, Borneo we found the <b>mites</b> <b>Tropilaelaps</b> clareae, Tropilaelaps koenigerum, Varroa rindereri, Varroa jacobsoni and Euvarroa wongsirii. Most were T. clareae, but T. koenigerum were also quite common. The V. rindereri {{specimens}} belonged to the same haplotype as described previously from A. koschevnikovi from Borneo. However, the V. jacobsoni belonged to a new haplotype, which we named the 'Borneo 2 haplotype of V. jacobsoni'. Of the mites detected in the debris, 84...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{honey bee}} colony losses, {{particularly}} during the winter, {{have been shown to}} be associated with the presence of both ectoparasitic mites and Deformed Wing Virus (DWV). Whilst the role of Varroa destructor mites as a viral vector is well established, the role of <b>Tropilaelaps</b> mercedesae <b>mites</b> in viral transmission has not been fully investigated. In this study, we tested the effects that V. destructor and T. mercedesae infestation have on fluctuation of the DWV copy number and alteration of the virus variants in honey bees by characterizing individual pupae and their infesting mites. We observed that both mite species were associated with increased viral copy number in honey bee pupae. We found a positive correlation between DWV copy number in pupae and copy number in infesting mites, and the same DWV type A variant was present in either low or high copy number in both honey bee pupae and infesting V. destructor. These data also suggest that variant diversity is similar between honey bee pupae and the mites that infest them. These results support a previously proposed hypothesis that DWV suppresses the honey bee immune system when virus copy number reaches a specific threshold, promoting greater replication...|$|R
40|$|Historically an {{ectoparasite}} of {{the native}} Giant honey bee Apis dorsata, the <b>mite</b> <b>Tropilaelaps</b> mercedesae has switched hosts to the introduced western honey bee Apis mellifera throughout much of Asia. Few data regarding lethal and sub-lethal effects of T. mercedesae on A. mellifera exist, despite its similarity to the devastating mite Varroa destructor. Here we artificially infested worker brood of A. mellifera with T. mercedesae to investigate lethal (longevity) and sub-lethal (emergence weight, Deformed wing virus (DWV) levels and clinical symptoms of DWV) effects of the mite on its new host. The data show that T. mercedesae infestation significantly reduced host longevity and emergence weight, and promoted both DWV levels and associated clinical symptoms. Our results suggest that T. mercedesae is a potentially important parasite to the economically important A. mellifera honey bee...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade the {{beekeeping}} sector in various {{countries around the world}} is affected by a variety of health problems. In addition to the use of pesticides the biggest problem of bees are considered their own diseases, which include the small hive beetle (Aethina tumida) and bee parasite Tropilaelaps spp. Commission of the European Union (EU) in 2003 adopted regulation No 1398 / 2003 on the protection of the bee population in the EU against to two exotic parasites "the small hive beetle" and <b>mite</b> <b>Tropilaelaps</b> clerae. While Tropilaelaps clerae never been registered in the EU, unfortunately small hive beetle after 2004 in Portugal, in September 2014 appeared in Italy again.

40|$|<b>Tropilaelaps</b> mercedesae (small <b>mite)</b> {{is one of}} {{two major}} honey bee ectoparasitic mite species {{responsible}} for the colony losses of Apis mellifera in Asia. Although T. mercedesae mites are still restricted in Asia (except Japan), they may diffuse all over the world due to the ever-increasing global trade of live honey bees (ex. Varroa destructor). Understanding the ecological characteristics of T. mercedesae at molecular level could potentially result in improving the management and control programs. However, molecular and genomic characterization of T. mercedesae remains poorly studied, and even no genes have been deposited in Genbank to date. Therefore, I conducted T. mercedesae genome and transcriptome sequencing. By comparing T. mercedesae genome with other arthropods, I have gained new insights into evolution of Parasitiformes and the evolutionary changes associated with specific habitats and life history of honey bee ectoparasitic mite that could potentially improve the control programs of T. mercedesae. Finally, characterization of T. mercedesae transient receptor potential channel, subfamily A, member 1 (TmTRPA 1) would also help us to develop a novel control method for T. mercedesae...|$|R
40|$|The 2010 Limited National survey, {{focusing}} on 13 states, {{was performed to}} expand and augment the baseline pest and pathogen data collected from the pilot study conducted in 2009. It is the most comprehensive U. S. honey bee pest and disease survey to date. The primary focus of this survey was to verify {{the absence of the}} parasitic <b>mite</b> <b>Tropilaelaps</b> and other exotic threats to the U. S. bee population (e. g., Apis cerana). Under current international trade agreements, the U. S. cannot deny import permits from other nations unless the exporting nation has a disease, parasite, or pest of honey bees that is not found in the U. S. Establishing the absence of threats to honey bee populations not thought to be present in the U. S. was the primary objective of this effort. To capitalize on the information gathered from this survey, samples were analyzed for other honey bee diseases and parasites known to be present in the U. S. The survey results are used to gauge the overall health of colonies and to help create a disease level baseline to help interpret ongoing and future epidemiological studies. The 2010 - 2011 National Survey effort was limited to collection of samples from 13 states including Alabama, California, Florida...|$|R
40|$|Few {{areas of}} the world have western honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies that are free of {{invasive}} parasites Nosema ceranae (fungi) and Varroa destructor (mites). Particularly detrimental is V. destructor; in addition to feeding on host haemolymph, these mites are important vectors of several viruses that are further implicated as contributors to honey bee mortality around the world. Thus, the biogeography and attendant consequences of viral communities in the absence of V. destructor are of significant interest. The island of Newfoundland, Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, is free of V. destructor; the absence of N. ceranae has not been confirmed. Of 55 Newfoundland colonies inspected visually for their strength and six signs of disease, only K-wing had prevalence above 5 % (40 / 55 colonies = 72. 7 %). Similar to an earlier study, screenings again confirmed the absence of V. destructor, small hive beetles Aethina tumida (Murray), tracheal mites Acarapis woodi (Rennie), and <b>Tropilaelaps</b> spp. ectoparasitic <b>mites.</b> Of a subset of 23 colonies screened molecularly for viruses, none had Israeli acute paralysis virus, Kashmir bee virus, or sacbrood virus. Sixteen of 23 colonies (70. 0 %) were positive for black queen cell virus, and 21 (91. 3 %) had some evidence for deformed wing virus. No N. ceranae was detected in molecular screens of 55 colonies, although it is possible extremely low intensity infections exist; the more familiar N. apis was found i...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBehavioral {{responses}} of Apis cerana, Apis dorsata, and Apis mellifera to the ectoparasitic <b>mite,</b> <b>Tropilaelaps</b> mercedesae, were compared using two laboratory bioassays: cohorts of 50 caged worker bees and individual-caged worker bees, all of unknown ages. For the group bioassays, ten T. mercedesae {{were placed on}} the bodies of bees in each cohort. After 6  h, nearly 2 / 3 of the mites placed on A. cerana had fallen from the bees onto sticky traps that were placed under the cages, compared to only about 1 / 3 for A. dorsata and A. mellifera. The majority of fallen mites fell within 24  h from A. cerana (93. 3 [*]±[*] 2. 3 %), 36  h from A. dorsata (92. 2 [*]±[*] 1. 9 %), and 48  h from A. mellifera (91. 3 [*]±[*] 1. 4 %). Higher proportions of injured mites were observed among the mites that fell from A. cerana (38. 3 [*]±[*] 12. 9 %) and A. dorsata (33. 9 [*]±[*] 17. 4 %) than among those that fell from A. mellifera (19. 5 [*]±[*] 7. 2 %). The rapid fall of mites from the bodies of A. cerana may be due to a combination of auto-grooming and rapid body shaking of the bees. In individual bee assays, where individual bees were challenged with one female T. mercedesae, A. cerana and A. dorsata exhibited faster behavioral responses to the presence of mites than did A. mellifera (39. 4 [*]±[*] 13. 2, 44. 9 [*]±[*] 19. 2, and 188. 4 [*]±[*] 63. 9  s, respectively).
