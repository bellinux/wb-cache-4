5|$|Network Rail has {{constructed}} a balcony along almost the whole width of <b>the</b> <b>concourse</b> at the first-floor level. The project's aims were to provide 18 new retail spaces and a champagne bar, reduce congestion on <b>the</b> <b>concourse,</b> and improve access to Waterloo East station by providing additional escalators {{leading to the}} high-level walkway between Waterloo and Waterloo East. Retail and catering outlets {{have been removed from}} <b>the</b> <b>concourse</b> to make more circulation space. First-floor offices have been converted into replacement and additional retail and catering spaces. Work was completed in July 2012, at a cost of £25million.|$|E
5|$|In September 2008, the {{northwest}} {{wing of the}} D Gates was completed. This marked the completion of <b>the</b> <b>concourse,</b> which has a total of 44 gates.|$|E
5|$|This {{station was}} not {{intended}} to be the terminus of <b>the</b> <b>Concourse</b> Line or the D train; both tracks were supposed to have been extended east past Bronx Park and the IRT White Plains Road Line along Burke Avenue to serve the northeast section of the Bronx. This idea was postponed due to lack of funding, and ultimately abandoned when the City of New York bought the right-of-way of the bankrupt New York, Westchester and Boston Railway and converted it for subway use in 1941. Another proposal in the 1970s involved extending <b>the</b> <b>Concourse</b> Line to White Plains Road, but financial troubles caused the plan to be aborted.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>concourses</b> {{and main}} {{terminal}} {{are laid out}} similarly to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The main difference is that DIA has no satellite unit of T gates directly attached to the terminal, and the space between <b>the</b> <b>concourses</b> at DIA is much wider than the space between <b>the</b> <b>concourses</b> in Atlanta. This allows for maximum operating efficiency as aircraft can push back from their gate while other taxiing aircraft can still taxi through the alley behind them without delay.|$|R
50|$|Originally, <b>the</b> {{southern}} <b>concourse</b> was <b>the</b> only <b>concourse</b> in this station. Because <b>the</b> two <b>concourses</b> {{were built}} in separate years, they were not originally interconnected. MTR renovated the station in 2015, connecting <b>the</b> two <b>concourses</b> in <b>the</b> process. The new link opened on 12 December 2015.|$|R
5|$|Access {{to parts}} of the station is {{difficult}} for people with physical disability. The introduction of lifts in 2010 made the taxi rank and underground station accessible from <b>the</b> <b>concourse,</b> though customers found them unreliable and frequently broken down. Wayfindr technology {{was introduced to the}} station in 2015 to help the visually impaired navigate the station.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, {{a bronze}} state of Brunel was erected {{on the station}} concourse. It was sculpted by John Doubleday and funded by the Bristol and West Building Society. Between 1989 and 1999, the Lawn was re-roofed and {{separated}} from <b>the</b> <b>concourse</b> by a glass screen wall. It is surrounded by shops and cafes on several levels.|$|E
5|$|King's Cross was a London {{terminus}} for InterCity 125 {{high speed}} services, along with Paddington. By 1982, almost all long-distances trains leaving King's Cross were 125s. The service {{proved to be}} popular, and the station saw regular queues across <b>the</b> <b>concourse</b> to board departing trains.|$|E

25|$|The {{terminal}} building splits into two international <b>concourses,</b> <b>the</b> north <b>concourse</b> with 2 gates (5 and 6) and <b>the</b> south <b>concourse</b> with 4 gates (1 to 4).|$|R
5|$|Several {{concession}} {{stands and}} cart vendors {{are located on}} <b>the</b> <b>concourse.</b> The stadium was home to a full-service restaurant called Sluggers Sports Bar and Grill, which was located {{on the fourth floor}} and closed when the Sounds vacated Greer. The restaurant and bar was open during all Sounds home dates, and games could be viewed from the restaurant via windows overlooking the field.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>concourse</b> {{stretches}} {{across the}} heads of platforms 1 to 12, underneath the London end of the four train sheds. Platform 14 can only be reached indirectly via the north-western end of platform 12. A footbridge crosses the north-western end of the station and gives access to platforms 1–12 and 14. There are ticket barriers to platforms 2–5 and 10–16.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground floor}} of the {{building}} was dedicated to public access and use. It is entered via wide steps under columns that are three- or four-storeys high, and these pilotis {{create a sense of}} space for the naturally ventilated public lobby areas. From <b>the</b> <b>concourse,</b> which is decorated with wall-relief sculptures, steps lead to upper and lower public service areas, a cafeteria and carparks.|$|E
50|$|Visitors had to {{pass through}} metal {{detectors}} and have their carry-on luggage X-rayed before entering <b>the</b> <b>concourses.</b> Photo ID was not required, as at that time <b>the</b> sterile <b>concourse</b> was still viewed as a public area.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> Western <b>Concourse</b> {{opened in}} March 2013 and conjoins onto <b>the</b> Southern <b>Concourse</b> Terminal. Virgin Australia uses its {{check-in}} counters and departure gates. <b>The</b> Western <b>Concourse</b> also includes <b>the</b> 300-seat Virgin Lounge and Virgin's invitation-only The Club.|$|R

5|$|The {{station is}} one of two {{separate}} Underground stations of the same name. The other station, on Praed Street to the south of the mainline station, is served by the Bakerloo, Circle and District lines. Although shown on the London Underground map as a single station, the two stations are not directly linked and interchange between them is via <b>the</b> <b>concourse</b> of the mainline station.|$|E
5|$|The station {{opened with}} a dining {{restaurant}} and a buffet. The restaurant was changed to a self-service operation when British Rail took over in 1948. The Victoria and Albert bar opened on 14 December 1971. In the 21st century, <b>the</b> <b>concourse</b> contains a small selection of shops.|$|E
5|$|As {{shown in}} the photos, the parking garage is still in use by a local branch of National Car Rental. Today, {{the highest level of}} ice hockey is played nearby at Centre Bell, the home arena of the NHL Montreal Canadiens, located two blocks south. Ice skating for {{pleasure}} remains a popular pastime and an indoor ice skating rink exists nearby in <b>the</b> <b>concourse</b> of the 'Le 1000 de la Gauchetiere' office building, open year-round.|$|E
25|$|Construction of <b>the</b> Southern <b>Concourse</b> was {{completed}} in late 2010 and came into service on 14 November. Qantas uses its check-in counters and departure gates. <b>The</b> Southern <b>Concourse</b> also includes <b>The</b> Qantas Club, The Qantas Business Class Lounge and The Qantas chairman's Lounge. The building's two wings, <b>the</b> Southern <b>Concourse</b> and <b>the</b> Western <b>Concourse</b> are separated by an Atrium, the centrepiece of the terminal.|$|R
50|$|Townsville International Airport has an {{integrated}} terminal building, with <b>the</b> Southern <b>concourse</b> <b>the</b> international terminal, and <b>the</b> Northern <b>concourse</b> <b>the</b> domestic terminal. The terminal has four aerobridges (1 international, 3 domestic) and three ground level tarmac departure / arrival gates for regional flights at the Northern {{end of the}} terminal.|$|R
50|$|Reached via Milton Proby Parkway, the {{terminal}} {{consists of two}} concourses. However, only one, <b>the</b> larger <b>concourse</b> housing gates 1-12, has ever been put to commercial use; <b>the</b> second <b>concourse</b> (called <b>the</b> Western Pacific Airlines concourse) contains gates 14-18 (there is no gate 13) and is now mainly used for meetings. Access between <b>the</b> <b>concourses</b> requires leaving <b>the</b> secure area, walking through the main terminal and down a long hallway.|$|R
5|$|Four {{permanent}} concession {{stands and}} several portable carts located on <b>the</b> <b>concourse</b> offer traditional ballpark foods including hot dogs, corn dogs, pizza, soft pretzels, ice cream, and popcorn. Each stand also serves foods unique to and common in Nashville and the South, including Nashville hot chicken, pulled pork barbecue sandwiches, and Tennessee chow chow pork chop sandwiches. The stadium's second level has a bar, lounge, and concessions area {{with views of}} the field; it is accessible only by those with suite, party-deck, or upper-deck tickets.|$|E
5|$|MFP Baseball, which {{purchased}} the Sounds in early 2009, invested over $2million to make repairs and upgrades to the aging stadium's playing field, restrooms, concession stands, scoreboard, sound system, and seating. The infield was re-sodded and leveled, protective railing was installed {{along the edge}} of the field, and the backstop netting was replaced. The entire concourse and guitar scoreboard were repainted, broken seats were replaced, and Sluggers Sports Bar & Grill was remodeled. A permanent concert stage and a family fun zone were constructed by <b>the</b> <b>concourse</b> entrance.|$|E
5|$|Seating at the {{ballpark}} includes fixed stadium seats, general admission bleachers, some with contoured seats, and eighteen skyboxes located on the third floor. As of 2014, total seating capacity is 10,300. Games can be watched from one of four picnic areas—one behind home plate, one on the third base line, one in the third base stands, and one beyond the right field wall. A rentable hot tub deck {{is located in the}} right field corner. There is a concert stage and family fun zone located on The Plaza inside <b>the</b> <b>concourse</b> entrance.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> primary 100-level <b>concourse</b> is at street level, with elevators, {{escalators}} and stairs {{separating the}} outfield and infield sections, since {{the ground is}} at different grades on either side. The 200-level loge box concourse is further separated, and is carpeted, as it includes the entrances {{to most of the}} luxury suites. <b>The</b> 300-level <b>concourse</b> is <b>the</b> highest of <b>the</b> <b>concourses.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Terminal A has two <b>concourses.</b> <b>The</b> East <b>Concourse</b> (Gates 1-12) hosts Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, and Southwest Airlines while <b>the</b> West <b>Concourse</b> (Gates 20-30) hosts American Airlines, [...] Norwegian Air Shuttle, OneJet, Spirit Airlines and United Airlines.|$|R
5|$|The {{station is}} in two parts: sub-surface platforms, opened in 1868 and deep-level platforms, opened in 1913. It {{is one of}} two {{separate}} Underground stations of the same name. The other station, {{to the north of the}} mainline station, is served by the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines. Although shown on the London Underground map as a single station, the two stations are not directly linked and interchange between them is via <b>the</b> <b>concourse</b> of the mainline station.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} built {{as part of}} the sixth and seventh {{sections}} of the IND Concourse Line beginning in the late 1920s. The station was built underneath preexisting private property for most of its length, passing directly under East 205th Street at its eastern end. The station opened on July 1, 1933, {{along with the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>Concourse</b> subway. On July 1, 1937, an escalator was opened in the station, the first of its kind in the Bronx.|$|E
5|$|A $70 million {{renovation}} of airport facilities, designed by Brubaker, Brandt Inc., was initiated in 1979 for the airport's 50th anniversary and completed in 1981. This upgraded the airport's capacity to 250 flights per day by adding {{what is known}} today as Concourse B and added fully enclosed jetways at every gate. Ten years later in 1989, a second, $15.5 million, seven-gate south concourse (now Concourse A) was dedicated. <b>The</b> <b>concourse</b> was used exclusively by US Airways at the time, and later housed hubs for both America West Airlines until 2003, and Skybus Airlines until they shut it down in 2008 due to their bankruptcy. A north concourse was completed in 1996, which is now Concourse C, and was expanded in 2002.|$|E
50|$|The gates at Long Beach Airport {{are divided}} into the North and South Concourses, with eleven gates in all. JetBlue Airways is the sole {{occupant}} of <b>the</b> North <b>Concourse,</b> <b>the</b> larger of the two. Gates 1-4 are in <b>the</b> South <b>Concourse</b> and gates 5-11 in the North.|$|R
50|$|Below {{ground level}} are two {{separate}} concourses, located under King Street (north concourse), and under Commerce Court (south concourse). All entrances and exits connect to <b>the</b> north <b>concourse</b> except for ones along Melinda Street. Below <b>the</b> <b>concourses</b> are <b>the</b> subway platforms, connected by stairs and one escalator to the northbound platform on weekdays from 3:00 pm to 6:30 pm.|$|R
50|$|The {{theme is}} {{manifested}} through several {{features such as}} a wall at <b>the</b> Upper <b>Concourse</b> Level bearing a relief of the Rukunegara, the Malaysian national pledge. The ceiling above the escalator leading down from <b>the</b> Upper <b>Concourse</b> Level to <b>the</b> Lower <b>Concourse</b> Level bears a motif of {{the arms of the}} 14-pointed star on the flag of Malaysia.|$|R
