50|$|The tornado entered LaSalle County, Illinois from Putnam County, {{approximately}} 3 {{miles northeast}} {{of the town of}} Standard, producing F0 intensity damage in a wooded area southwest of Peru. As the tornado continued northeast, and F2 intensity damage was done to several homes in a subdivision near the intersection of East 250th and 2569th Roads. Several roofs were blown off homes, along with damage to external walls. Significant tree damage was done as well. Path width was estimated at 50 yards at this location. The tornado then continued northeast, crossing the Illinois River twice as it moved toward the town of Utica, downing a steel high <b>tension</b> <b>tower</b> on the north bank of the river, immediately west of Illinois 251. The tornado moved into the southwest side of Utica where it was at F0 intensity. Homes along Washington Street only had tree and minor roof damage. A church steeple was damaged between Johnson and Washington streets. Roofs and trees were more severely damaged {{on the south side of}} Johnson Street. The tornado rapidly increased to F3 intensity on the north side of Johnson Street where one home had its roof taken off, and north walls were blown out. A machinery building was completely destroyed on the south side of the canal and a semi-tractor trailer was blown into the canal. A large grain bin was blown across the canal and flattened. The tornado then moved north of the canal into the heart of town where several homes were severely damaged, garages were destroyed, and brick buildings collapsed. Eight people died and seven were rescued from the basement of the turn of the century sandstone Milestone Tap tavern. The structure collapsed when a vehicle was thrown into it. The tornado was approximately 250 yards wide at this point. On the east edge of the vortex along Mill Street, in downtown, buildings suffered damage to facades, roofs and windows. East of Mill Street there was damage to trees and minor roof damage. In the northeast section of town a mobile home was overturned just east of Mill Street. The vortex crossed the railroad tracks and apparently dissipated on a steep bluff on the northeast side of town. At the top of the hill there were some trees and limbs downed, and some debris from town was deposited.|$|E

40|$|AbstractExcavated {{transmission}} tower {{foundation in}} stiff soil is intensively recommended {{because it can}} basically keep soil undisturbed and thus adequately exert the strength of soil to resist the <b>tension</b> from transmission <b>tower</b> line. However, Chinese current code for design {{of this type of}} foundation exist certain problems. Therefore, this paper employed finite element method to simulate foundation uplift behavior in undisturbed soil and explained the difference among the results of two methods in code and FE analysis. Moreover, the effects of embedment depth, soil property, extended angle of foundation base on failure mode and ultimate uplift capacity are investigated by means of parametric analysis. It is concluded that shallow mode and deep mode occur for different embedment depth. Friction angle has significant effects on sliding surface, and cohesion slightly affects the shape of sliding surface.

The transmission lines are modeled by cable element {{accounting for the}} nonlinearity of the cable. For the suspension type, three towers and two span lines with spring model (Model 1) and three towers and four span lines’ model (Model 2) are established, respectively. For the <b>tension</b> type, three <b>towers</b> and two span lines’ model (Model 3) and three towers and four span lines’ model (Model 4) are created, respectively.

However, the responses of transmission tower and transmission line of the two models of the tension type are significantly different. Therefore, in order to obtain accurate results, a reasonable model should be considered. The results could provide a reference for the seismic analysis of the transmission tower-line system...|$|R

Operational conditions were a significant wave height of 6. 0 ft, wind velocity of 30 knots, I and a current velocity of 2 knots. The mooring system was designed for operation in a minimum depth of 30 ft and a maximum depth of 45 ft. The following operational criteria were also required for the mooring design: (a) transportation by truck or rail, (b) rapid assembly {{with little or no}} diver support, and (c) installation with a minimum of lift support. The report examines five alternatives: (a) a guyed <b>tower,</b> <b>tension</b> leg platform (TLP), (b) a single anchor mooring (SALM), (c) a three-leg catenary anchor leg mooring (CALM), and (d) a four-leg CALM.

40|$|Wind energy are {{deployed}} by {{two types of}} wind turbines. They are Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) and Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT), classified according to their axis of rotation. In recent years, offshore wind energy playing {{a vital role in}} the wind turbine industry due to high intensity of air, less turbulent and comparatively clean and easily employed in large area which is difficult to manage for onshore or near-shore. The advantages of HAWTs are now facing different challenge in the offshore field due to its cost effectiveness. For this reason, VAWTs have the potential to reduce the cost of producing per unit power. Hence, the emergence and growing interest for VAWTs for offshore application. The availability of fully coupled simulation tools are extremely limited and more sophisticated tools are necessary to carry out the simulation in a fully coupled manner. In this thesis, we used SIMO-RIFLEX-AC for the fully coupled simulation developed by NTNU/MARINTEK. SIMO is capable to calculate the rigid body hydrodynamics forces and different moments on the floater which is designed to support the VAWT. RIFLEX is used to model the tower, blades, struts, mooring lines as flexible finite elements. To calculate the aerodynamic loads acting on the wind turbine we used Actuator Cylinder (AC) model. In addition, it accounts the effect of wind shear and turbulence, dynamic stall by using BL (Beddoes-Leishman) model and dynamic inflow. Then this code was coupled with SIMO-RIFLEX to carry out the integrated analysis. To carry out the fully coupled simulation in time domain, a model was developed in HydroD and analyze the response in the frequency domain. The model was then modified in SIMO and used for coupled simulation. This model is used to study the various cases such as decay test, steady wind test and turbulent and irregular wave test. Also, we carried out a study on the second order mean drift force to check the response of the system. To calculate the second order effect, we use Newman approximation, otherwise to evaluate the second order transfer function is really time consuming. Then we compare our data with different types of vertical wind turbine such as OC 4 semi-submersible and landbased wind turbine and carried out a detail study. We focus our study on motion response; performance of the wind turbine such as power, rotor speed, thrust, torque; mooring line <b>tension</b> and <b>tower</b> base bending moment. We also carried out power spectral analysis to see response in different frequency ranges. Considering three wind load cases such as one is below rated speed, one is the rated speed and the last one is above rated speed. The later study was carried out by using the WAFO which is used as a MATLAB routines. One of the focus of the study is to optimize the original OC 4 semi-submersible used to support the NREL 5 MW wind turbine. The optimization was carried out in terms of reducing the weight and reducing the principal parameters of the platform which was carried out in the project. The optimization was satisfactory in terms of weight and its behavior because the modified OC 4 semi-submersible preserve the main characteristics such as natural frequency and damping ratio. In general, a fully coupled analysis was carried out to observe the dynamic characteristic of the wind turbine and applied the results to compare its characteristics with other floating and landbased VAWTs. This will in turn helps us to reveal {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using vertical axis wind turbine than horizontal axis wind turbine. Also, it will help to understand dynamic characteristics and behavior of different wind turbines...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of big-size wind turbine is constrained to land-base and shallow water nowadays. It is still challenging to build big-size offshore wind turbines in deep water. But challenge means opportunity. This thesis {{aims to examine}} a state-of-art TLP floater initial design for supporting the 10 MW DTU reference wind turbine. The TLP floater consists of one single column, three spokes and three pretension tendons. In the meantime of this project, parallel works (Semi and Spar floaters) are designed. The obtained properties of these three concepts are compared. Fundamentally different from other offshore structures, the TLPWT employs a tension mooring system instead of a catenary mooring system. The pretension per line is 28064 kN and the yield tendon axial force is 1. 8 * 10 ^ 5 kN. Due to the stiffed tendons, the TLPWT has small response motions. Therefore, the tendon tensions are almost constant even in 50 -year extreme conditions. Additionally, the maximum tension 1 and minimum tension 3 are examined by ULS, which {{results show that the}} TLPWT tendons have no possibility of slacking or exceeding yields tension. On the other hand, the response motions of the SemiWT and SparWT are relatively larger. The SparWT can experience maximum surge motion up to 25 m and SemiWT can experience maximum pitch motion 16 deg at wind speed 11. 4 m/s. The hydrodynamic behaviours of the TLPWT are assessed in details by performing a wave-only frequency-domain analysis in head sea. The added mass and damping coefficients present strong wave-frequency dependence. The viscous damping effect is of importance in the surge motion of the TLPWT in long waves. In order to compute correct second-order results within the element number limit, a mesh convergence study is performed regarding to the mesh size and radius of the second-order free surface model. Mesh case 3 is selected after a series of comparisons. As the second-order forces are small, their most important contribution is in the vicinity of resonance. For instance, the resonance of heave QTF coincides with the pitch/bending natural frequency. The natural periods of the TLPWT are 45. 23 s, 0. 55 s, 0. 60 s and 20. 87 s in surge/sway, heave, pitch/roll and yaw respectively. It is very soft in horizontal motions, but quite stiff in vertical motions due to stiffed tendon mooring system. On the contrary, the SemiWT and SparWT concept are soft in both horizontal and vertical planes. Furthermore, {{it should be noted that}} the flexibility of the tower has a significant contribution to the TLPWT pitch motion. The tower bending natural period is 3. 49 s. The rated wind speed for the three concepts is 11. 4 m/s. The wind turbine controller plays a vital role during operation process to maximize the energy capture, and minimize the external loads and thus response motions. In critical weather conditions, the controller can pitch, feather or even shutdown the turbine. Consequently, the platform motions become less, but the rotor speed, generated torque and produced power still keep constant. The TLPWT experiences wave frequency motions of the same order of magnitude as those of SemiWT and SparWT in horizontal plane. In the vertical plane, however, the TLPWT behaves like a fixed structure. In addition, the heave motion and pitch motion of the TLPWT are kinematically coupled with its surge motion. Usually the low-frequency TLPWT motions are primarily excited by wind, while its pitch motion, blade root bending moment, tower base bending moment and tensions are excited by incoming wave frequency. Nevertheless, in harsh weather, the turbine is shutdown and all the performances of the TLPWT are therefore dominated by wave frequency. In summary, the global performance behaviour of the TLPWT is desirable for a structure this size. The tension-leg mooring system suppresses nearly all vertical motions. The horizontal motion is quite small even in extreme weather conditions and thus there is rare change representing in <b>tensions.</b> Furthermore, the <b>tower</b> base and blade root bending moment are also much smaller than the Semi and Spar wind turbine. This TLPWT concept features with wide weather window, great load capacity and high stability. It is definitely reliable for the {{application of}} offshore wind turbines in deep water...|$|R
