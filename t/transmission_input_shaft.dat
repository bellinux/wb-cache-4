50|$|For the Mondial t, {{the engine}} and {{transmission}} were substantially reconfigured and their orientations rotated by ninety degrees to place the axes of both the engine crankshaft and the <b>transmission</b> <b>input</b> <b>shafts</b> parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal axis. The transmission and final-drive units form a combined transaxle arrangement fitted {{to the rear of}} the engine block, using a design originally derived from Ferrari's 312T Formula 1 car. Drive from the single-plate clutch enters the gearbox and is turned ninety degrees by bevel gears to the main transmission shafts which are aligned transverse to the vehicle. A parallel crownwheel with integral limited-slip action directs output torque to driveshafts with CV joints at each end. The clutch is hydraulically-actuated, and gear selection is via cable operation.|$|R
50|$|Transmission had {{a number}} of parts changed due to design defect that caused 2nd gear to slip and cause <b>transmission</b> failures. The <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> {{and a number of other}} parts were {{upgraded}} and an internal service bulletin issued by Suzuki to its dealerships.|$|R
50|$|These defects {{are caused}} by a faulty throw out bearing, {{transmission}} control module, or a leak from either the engine's rear main seal or the <b>transmission</b> <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> seals. Ford has released made in USA band aid fixes of the seals and updated clutch kits but the transmission will eventually have the same issues. These transmissions are still equipped into the newer model Focus and Fiesta.|$|E
50|$|The Roto-Hydramatic did {{not have}} a {{conventional}} fluid coupling or torque converter but had an internal fluid coupling with a torque multiplier. There was no real bell housing; instead, the Roto-Hydramatic had a kind of flange connecting the transmission to the engine. The power flow from the engine crankshaft to the <b>transmission</b> <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> was connected via a flywheel containing a set of springs to absorb torsional vibrations at the flexplate.|$|E

5000|$|In other words, when {{reverse gear}} is selected, {{it is in}} fact actual gear teeth that are being meshed, with no aid from a {{synchronization}} mechanism. For this reason, the output shaft must not be rotating when reverse is selected: the car must be stopped. In order that reverse can be selected without grinding even if the <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> is spinning inertially, there may be a mechanism to stop the <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> from spinning. The driver brings the vehicle to a stop, and selects reverse. As that selection is made, some mechanism in the <b>transmission</b> stops the <b>input</b> <b>shaft.</b> Both gears are stopped and the idler can be inserted between them.

50|$|In a rear-wheel-drive <b>transmission,</b> the <b>input</b> {{and output}} <b>shaft</b> lie {{along the same}} line, and {{may in fact be}} {{combined}} into a single shaft within the transmission. This single shaft is called a mainshaft. The input and output ends of this combined shaft rotate independently, at different speeds, which is possible because one piece slides into a hollow bore in the other piece, where it is supported by a bearing. Sometimes the term mainshaft refers to just the <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> or just the output shaft, rather than the entire assembly.|$|R
50|$|Motorcycles {{typically}} {{employ a}} wet clutch with the clutch {{riding in the}} same oil as the transmission. These clutches are usually {{made up of a}} stack of alternating plain steel and friction plates. Some plates have lugs on their inner diameters that lock them to the engine crankshaft. Other plates have lugs on their outer diameters that lock them to a basket that turns the <b>transmission</b> <b>input</b> <b>shaft.</b> A set of coil springs or a diaphragm spring plate force the plates together when the clutch is engaged.|$|E
50|$|The {{clutch in}} a manual-shift {{motorcycle}} transmission is typically {{an arrangement of}} plates stacked in alternating fashion, one geared on the inside to the engine and the next geared on the outside to the <b>transmission</b> <b>input</b> <b>shaft.</b> Whether wet (rotating in engine oil) or dry, the plates are squeezed together by a spring, causing friction build up between the plates until they rotate as a single unit, driving the transmission directly. A lever on the handlebar exploits mechanical advantage through a cable or hydraulic arrangement {{to release the clutch}} spring(s), allowing the engine to freewheel with respect to the transmission.|$|E
50|$|Unlike with {{ordinary}} gear trains, {{the direction of}} <b>transmission</b> (<b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> vs output shaft) is not reversible when using large reduction ratios, due to the greater friction involved between the worm and worm-wheel, when usually a single start (one spiral) worm is used. This can be an advantage when it is desired to eliminate any possibility of the output driving the input. If a multistart worm (multiple spirals) is used then the ratio reduces accordingly and the braking effect of a worm and worm-gear {{may need to be}} discounted, as the gear may be able to drive the worm.|$|E

5000|$|There are two {{designs for}} the 5LM60 <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> and {{bearings}} (<b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> and main shaft).

50|$|The basic {{mechanism}} {{consisted of}} three moving parts, an <b>input</b> <b>shaft,</b> an output disk, and some sort of roller or disk between the two. Generally the <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> was electrically driven and used some sort of governor to ensure it spun at a constant speed. The output was a metal disk on a shaft that was arranged {{at right angles to}} the input. That is, if the <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> was vertically aligned, the output shaft would be horizontal, with the disk {{on the end of the}} output shaft lying vertically beside the input.|$|R
5000|$|The inline {{engine was}} {{inherently}} suitable for shaft drive, and BMW-style bevel gears {{would have been}} ideal. However, having inherited some worm-gear machinery from Lanchester Motors, BSA opted to specify worm drive rather than bevel gears. Worm gears were entirely unsuitable, since the direction of <b>transmission</b> (<b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> vs output shaft) is not reversible when using large reduction ratios. Reputedly this created problems with the shaft drive, as the gears tended to strip under power. [...] It is said that Sunbeam's [...] "solution" [...] to this was to reduce the power to , which did nothing to help post-war sales.|$|E
50|$|Previously, {{motorcycles}} with a non-primary {{starting system}} used the <b>transmission</b> <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> and clutch hub {{to connect the}} kick-start lever to crankshaft. It was thus necessary for the rider to first put the transmission into neutral, and then {{to engage the clutch}} before the starting the engine by pushing down on the kick-start lever. With its primary starting system, the YA-1 engine is equipped with a mechanism in which the primary driven gear is turned by means of a kick idling gear and kick pinion. This enables the rider to simply pull the clutch lever on the handlebar (i.e., disengage the clutch) and then to kick-start engine, regardless of whether the transmission is in neutral or in (any) gear. This mechanism is now the established kick start system for motorcycles worldwide.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Clutch {{system is}} among the main systems inside a vehicle. Clutch is a {{mechanical}} device located between a vehicle engine and its transmission and provides mechanical coupling between the engine and <b>transmission</b> <b>input</b> <b>shaft.</b> Clutch system comprise of flywheel, clutch disc plate and friction material, pressure plate, clutch cover, diaphragm spring and the linkage necessary to operate the clutch. The clutch engages the transmission gradually by allowing {{a certain amount of}} slippage between the flywheel and the <b>transmission</b> <b>input</b> <b>shaft.</b> However, the slipping mechanism of the clutch generates heat energy due to friction between the clutch disc and the flywheel. At high sliding velocity, excessive frictional heat is generated which lead to high temperature rise at the clutch disc surface, and this causes thermo-mechanical problems such as thermal deformations and thermo-elastic instability which can lead to thermal cracking, wear and other mode of failure of the clutch disc component. In this project, the modeling of clutch is done in detailed using modeling software. After that the FEM analysis is done for sintered iron friction material. The stresses & deformation obtained for this friction material is then compared to analysis software result. The analysis is done for worn out friction disc.

50|$|Front-wheel and rear-wheel-drive {{transmissions}} operate similarly. When {{the transmission}} {{is put in}} neutral and the clutch is disengaged, the <b>input</b> <b>shaft,</b> clutch disk and countershaft can continue to rotate under their own inertia. In this state, the engine, the <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> and clutch, and the output shaft all rotate independently.|$|R
5000|$|The early model C4 (1964-1969) used a [...]788-inch 24-spline <b>input</b> <b>shaft,</b> {{which was}} {{upgraded}} in 1970 to 26-spline and [...]839-inch. The upgrade {{also included a}} matching clutch hub of 26-spline. In 1971, Ford went to a 26/24-spline <b>input</b> <b>shaft,</b> meaning the torque-converter side is 26-spline and the clutch hub is 24-spline.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} pins {{on the ring}} gear {{is larger than the}} number of pins on the {{cycloidal}} disc. This causes the cycloidal disc to rotate around the bearing faster than the <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> is moving it around, giving an overall rotation in the direction opposing the rotation of the <b>input</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper; two {{models of the}} input shaft for a Longitudinal Mounted four Speed Automotive Automatic Transmission {{for the first time}} were {{introduced}} to describe the input shaft critical loads. In the first model; the DC (Di rect Clutch) connects two gears together. This gives no change in the set torque (the set output torque equal to the set input torque). In the second model; the ODB (Over Drive Brake) fixes one element of the planetary set. This is resulting, the gear set gives reduction ratio (the set output torque is not equal to the set input torque). So, the <b>transmission</b> <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> is worked under two different working operating conditions of torque. Also, it is loaded by a two vertical loads which are coming from the turbine and planetary set loads respectively. They are shown that there are three critical combinations of forces (contact force, shear force, and normal force) applied on the input shaft. The critical forces can be possibility exist three types of cracks for the input shaft cross section they are: transverse (torsion stress), longitud i nal (bending stress), and vertical (shear stress). The three cracks are studied in this article. The article considers three stress factors: shearing torsion stress, shear stress, and bending stress. </p...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{published}} as Open Access by Elsevier under the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) Licence 4. 0 Torsional vibrations transmitted {{from the engine}} to the drivetrain system induce a plethora of noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) concerns such a transmission gear rattle and clutch in-cycle vibration, to name but a few. The main elements of these oscillations are variations in the inertial imbalance and the constituents of combustion power torque, collectively referred to as engine order vibration. To attenuate {{the effect of these}} transmitted vibration and their oscillatory effects in the drive train system, a host of palliative measures are employed in practice, such as clutch pre-dampers, slipping disks, dual mass flywheel and others, all of which operate effectively over a narrow band of frequencies and have various unintended repercussions. These include increased powertrain inertia, installation package space and cost. This paper presents a numerical study of the use of multiple Nonlinear Energy Sinks (NES) as a means of attenuating the torsional oscillations for an extended frequency range and under transient vehicle manoeuvres. Frequency-Energy Plots (FEP) are used to obtain the nonlinear absorber parameters for multiple NES coupled in parallel to the clutch disc of a typical drivetrain configuration. The results obtained show significant reduction in the oscillations of the <b>transmission</b> <b>input</b> <b>shaft,</b> effective over a broad range of response frequencies. It is also noted that the targeted reduction of the acceleration amplitude of the input shaft requires significantly lower NES inertia, compared with the existing palliative measures...|$|E
