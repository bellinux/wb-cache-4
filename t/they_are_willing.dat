5|$|After all, {{young people}} are always searching for the beauty in love. They want their love to be beautiful. If they give in to weakness, {{following}} the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a 'scandal in the contemporary world' (and these are, unfortunately, widely diffused models), {{in the depths of}} their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure love. This is as true of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God can give them this love. As a result, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to follow Christ, without caring about the sacrifices this may entail.|$|E
5|$|The {{major factors}} {{influencing}} diving safety are the environment, the diving {{equipment and the}} performance of the diver and the dive team. The underwater environment is alien, both physically and psychologically stressful, and usually not amenable to control, though divers can be selective in the conditions in which <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to dive. The other factors must be controlled to mitigate the overall stress on the diver and allow the dive to be completed in acceptable safety. The equipment is critical to diver safety for life support, but is generally reliable, controllable and predictable in its performance.|$|E
5|$|Redbacks usually prey on insects, but {{can capture}} larger animals that become {{entangled}} in the web, including trapdoor spiders, small lizards, and even on rare occasion snakes. One web was recorded as containing a dead mouse. The woodlouse (Porcellio scaber) is a particularly common food item. Developing spiderlings need size-appropriate prey, and laboratory studies show that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to consume common fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor), muscoid flies and early nymphs of cockroaches. Food scraps and lighting attract insect prey to areas of human activity, which brings the redbacks. Once alerted to a creature becoming ensnared in a trap line, the redback advances to around a leg's length from its target, touching it and squirting a liquid glutinous silk over it to immobilise it. It then bites its victim repeatedly on the head, body and leg joints and wraps it in sticky and dry silk. Unlike other spiders, it does not rotate its prey while wrapping in silk, but like other spiders, it then injects a venom that liquefies its victim's innards. Once it has trussed the prey, the redback takes it to its retreat and begins sucking out the liquefied insides, generally 5 to 20 minutes after first attacking it. Redback spiders do not usually drink, except when starved.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} experiment, {{researchers}} asked subjects to make either origami frogs or cranes. They then asked the subjects how much <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> {{to pay for}} their own work. Following this, researchers gathered another group of subjects who had not taken part in the origami creation. The new subjects were asked how much <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to pay for an origami built by the participants.|$|R

25|$|According to {{the theory}} of {{rational}} expectations, borrowers and lenders form an expectation of inflation in the future.

25|$|Buying {{and selling}} flexibility: ETFs {{can be bought}} and sold at current market prices {{at any time during}} the trading day, unlike mutual funds and unit {{investment}} trusts, which can only be traded at the end of the trading day. As publicly traded securities, their shares can be purchased on margin and sold short, enabling the use of hedging strategies, and traded using stop orders and limit orders, which allow investors to specify the price points at which <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to trade.|$|E
25|$|ARMs {{generally}} permit borrowers {{to lower}} their initial payments if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to assume the risk of interest rate changes. There is evidence that consumers tend to prefer contracts with the lowest initial rates, {{such as in the}} UK where consumers tend to focus on immediate monthly mortgage costs. Decisions of consumers may also be affected by the advice they get, and much of the advice is provided by lenders who may prefer ARMs because of financial market structures.|$|E

25|$|The G20's {{transparency}} and accountability have been questioned by critics, who {{call attention to the}} absence of a formal charter {{and the fact that the}} most important G20 meetings are closed-door. In 2001, the economist Frances Stewart proposed an Economic Security Council within the United Nations as an alternative to the G20. In such a council, members would be elected by the General Assembly based on their importance to the world economy, and the contribution <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to provide to world economic development.|$|E
25|$|Grit {{affects the}} effort a person {{contributes}} by {{acting on the}} importance pathway. When people value a goal as more valuable, meaningful, or relevant to their self-concept <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to expend more effort on it when necessary. The influence of individual differences in grit results in different levels of effort-related cardiac activity when gritty and less gritty individuals performed the same task. Grit is associated with differences in potential motivation, one pathway in motivational intensity theory. Grit may also influence an individual’s perception of task difficulty.|$|E
30|$|When {{patients}} <b>were</b> {{asked if}} <b>they</b> would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to pay out-of-pocket {{to have an}} ACLR, 87 (34.8 %) said yes, 107 (42.8 %) said no, and 56 (22.4 %) said that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> unsure (Table  2). Of the patients who stated that they would pay out-of-pocket for the procedure, the median (IQR) amount <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to pay <b>was</b> $ 750.00 (1500.00). Moreover, when patients <b>were</b> asked if <b>they</b> would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to travel outside of Canada and pay out-of-pocket to have an ACLR, 41 (16.4 %) said yes, 151 (60.4 %) said no, and 58 (23.2 %) said that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> unsure. If patients stated <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to pay to travel outside of Canada to have the procedure performed, the median (IQR) amount <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> {{to pay for this}} option was $ 2500.00 (3750.00). Further, patients who <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to travel outside of Canada for an expedited ACLR <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to pay a median (IQR) amount of $ 2000.00 (2000.00) out-of-pocket to have the procedure done in Canada, whereas patients who were unwilling to travel outside of Canada <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to pay $ 600.00 (625.00) out-of-pocket to have the procedure done in Canada, and this difference was statistically significant (p[*]<[*] 0.000). A multinomial logistic regression did not demonstrate any significant correlations between patient demographic or characteristic variables and patients’ willingness to pay out-of-pocket for an expedited ACLR both within and outside of Canada.|$|R

25|$|Though {{many of the}} {{previously}} proposed models were both costly and uncoordinated, a 2010 model by Boyd, Gintis and Bowles presents a mechanism for coordinated costly punishment. In this quorum-sensing model, each agent chooses whether or not <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to engage in punishment. If {{a sufficient number of}} agents are willing to engage in punishment, then the group acts collectively to administer it. An important aspect of this model is that strong reciprocity is self-regarding when rare in the population, but may be altruistic when common within a group.|$|E
25|$|In microeconomics, the Bertrand–Edgeworth {{model of}} price-setting {{oligopoly}} looks at {{what happens when}} there is a homogeneous product (i.e. consumers want to buy from the cheapest seller) where {{there is a limit to}} the output of firms which <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> and able to sell at a particular price. This differs from the Bertrand competition model where it is assumed that firms are willing and able to meet all demand. The limit to output can be considered as a physical capacity constraint which is the same at all prices (as in Edgeworth’s work), or to vary with price under other assumptions.|$|E
25|$|Others contest these conclusions, {{stating that}} family courts are biased {{in favor of}} fathers and that the lower {{percentage}} of separated fathers as custodial parents {{is a result of}} choices made by fathers rather than bias of family courts. According to sociologist Michael Flood, father's rights activists have exaggerated the disparity in custody awards between mothers and fathers, and ignored {{the fact that in the}} vast majority of cases, fathers voluntarily relinquish custody of their children through private arrangements; either because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to do so, or because they do not expect a favorable court ruling.|$|E

25|$|Ruter {{has stated}} that the {{estimated}} investment cost would be NOK10 billion, but that the tunnel would give high utility and {{would be one of}} the most economic investments they could make. There is no funding for a new tunnel in Oslo Package 3. By 2010, it was discovered that Oslo Package 3 was under-financed, and it is uncertain how much of the investment will be made by 2027. With the new tunnel being made a high priority by the city planners, this will either require additional grants from the municipality or the state, an increase in the toll fees, or the delay of investments in the program to a future Oslo Package 4. The left-wing parties have stated that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to delay or abandon several road projects to allocate financing to a new tunnel, while the right-wing parties have stated that they are not willing to allow road projects to be undermined.|$|E
25|$|The {{affiliation}} deals {{greatly improved}} the financial {{viability of the}} clubs in question, but they diluted their ability to represent their suburb. There have been many changes to the affiliation arrangements in the decade since the VFL and VSFL merged, {{as well as a}} shift in the arrangement preferred by the AFL clubs. Initially, only four of the ten Victorian AFL clubs were involved in a VFL affiliation, with the rest fielding reserves teams. At its peak of between 2003–2006, nine of the ten Victorian AFL clubs were involved in an affiliation, with only Geelong fielding its own reserves team. Many clubs have since migrated away from this model, and since 2014 there have been five AFL clubs fielding stand-alone reserves teams in the VFL. Through the 2000s, the AFL preferred that its Victorian clubs retained VFL-affiliations, and offered a disincentive {{in the form of an}} inflated licence fee for fielding a stand-alone team; however, the AFL did not otherwise prevent teams from fielding stand-alone reserves teams if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> and able to pay the fee. The total licence and running costs for an AFL club to field its reserves team in the VFL were estimated to be $500,000 per year in 2011.|$|E
25|$|The spathe {{provides}} a safe breeding {{area for the}} beetles. As such, the male beetles are often followed by female beetles {{with the intent of}} mating with the males within the spathe. The philodendrons benefit from this symbiotic relationship because the males will eventually leave the spathe covered in pollen and repeat the process at another philodendron, pollinating it in the process and thus providing philodendrons a means of sexual reproduction. In addition to gaining a safe location to mate, the male beetles may benefit from having a central location, because it allows them to broadcast to females that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> and able to mate. Females which see a male beetle headed for a philodendron flower know he does so with intention of mating, and females which are sexually receptive and need to mate know that they can find males if they follow the pheromones produced by the philodendron flowers. As a result, the male beetles benefit from this relationship with the philodendrons because {{they do not have to}} produce pheromones to attract females, since the philodendrons do it for them. Additionally, male beetles benefit because they are ensured of mating with only sexually receptive females, which is not necessarily certain otherwise. In doing so, the philodendron provides male beetles a more efficient way to find females than what they could achieve on their own. Interestingly, pheromones produced by the philodendrons may be similar to those produced by female beetles when they wish to attract males to mate. Also, the pheromones have a sweet, fruity smell in many species and no noticeable smell for others. In addition to the reproductive benefits to beetles, the philodendrons provide food in two forms. Pollen from the fertile male flowers is eaten by the beetles throughout the night. Secondly, the sterile male flowers consumed by the beetles are rich in lipids.|$|E
