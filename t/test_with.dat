40|$|Situational {{judgment}} {{tests are}} personnel selection instruments that present job applicants with work-related situations and possible {{responses to the}} situations. The response instructions are of two types: behavioral tendency and knowledge. <b>Tests</b> <b>with</b> behavioral tendency instructions ask respondents to identify how they would likely behave in the situation. <b>Tests</b> <b>with</b> knowledge instructions ask respondents {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of possible responses to the situation. Results showed that the response instructions influenced the constructs measured by the <b>tests.</b> <b>Tests</b> <b>with</b> knowledge instructions had higher magnitude correlations with cognitive ability than <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> behavioral tendency instructions. <b>Tests</b> <b>with</b> behavioral tendency instructions showed higher correlations than those with knowledge instructions for the personality constructs conscientiousness, agreeableness and emotional stability. <b>Tests</b> <b>with</b> knowledge instructions showed higher criterion-related validity than <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> behavioral tendency instructions.

5|$|During the week, David Ian {{talked to}} the girls about fitness and stamina, and Claire Sweeney advised the singers on looking after {{themselves}} and their voices. The mission was a fitness <b>test,</b> <b>with</b> Olympic athlete Iwan Thomas, requiring the Marias to complete an assault course. The Marias also attended the première of the film You, Me and Dupree in Leicester Square.|$|E
5|$|For TSH, basal {{measurements}} are usually sufficient, {{as well as}} measurements of thyroxine {{to ensure that the}} pituitary is not simply suppressing TSH production in response to hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland). A stimulation <b>test</b> <b>with</b> thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is not regarded as useful. Prolactin can be measured by basal level, and is required for the interpretation of LH and FSH results in addition to the confirmation of hypopituitarism or diagnosis of a prolactin-secreting tumor.|$|E
5|$|However, Australia's {{winning run}} {{came to an}} end with a 30-run loss in the fifth <b>Test,</b> <b>with</b> Woodfull scoring 22 and 18. He ended the series with a modest 204 runs at 34.00 as Australia won 4–1. He ended the summer with 477 runs at 47.70.|$|E

40|$|Disk {{diffusion}} tests, inoculated {{directly from}} positive blood cultures, were evaluated for accuracy of reading zone diameters after 4 - and 6 -h and overnight incubation. In comparisons with results from standard disk diffusion tests, the 4 -h results were in agreement for 83 % of <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> gram-positive organisms and 64 % of <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> gram-negative organisms. When minor discrepancies were ignored, the 4 -h readings were in agreement for 98 % of the <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> gram-positive organisms and 95 % of the <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> gram-negative organisms. After 6 h of incubation, 91 % of the <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> gram-positive organisms and 86 % of the <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> gram-negative organisms agreed with standard results. The agreement was 99 % for <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms when minor discrepancies were excluded. Very major discrepancies occurred in two tests (0. 1 %) with gram-positive organisms {{and were not}} observed in <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> gram-negative organisms. The frequencies of major discrepancies were 3. 5 % after 4 h, 0. 6 % after 6 h, and 0. 7 % after overnight incubation. Ampicillin and cephalothin <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. accounted for 81 % of the major discrepancies in <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> gram-negative organisms. Oxacillin tests {{accounted for more than}} half of the major discrepancies in <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> staphylococci. The results of this study, which did not include the newer antibiotics, indicate that direct susceptibility tests from blood cultures read after 6 h of incubation are more reliable than 4 -h results and produce less than 1 % major errors in comparisons <b>with</b> standard susceptibility <b>tests...</b>|$|R

5|$|In deposit, the spore {{color of}} Rhodotus palmatus has been {{described}} most commonly as pink, but also as cream colored. Viewed microscopically, the spores of Rhodotus have a roughly spherical shape, with dimensions of 6–7.2 by 5.6–6.5µm; the spore surface is marked with numerous wart-like projections (defined as verricose), typically 0.5–0.7µm long. The spores are non-amyloid—unable to take up iodine stain in the chemical <b>test</b> <b>with</b> Melzer's reagent.|$|E

30|$|The {{results of}} the {{conducted}} tests show good comparability between the effects of pristine NM- 300 K and long-term <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> NM- 300 K (application via sewage sludge) on soil microorganisms and in further <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> plants (data not shown). In both <b>test</b> types (<b>with</b> pristine NM- 300 K and in long-term tests), nitrifiers were the most sensitive to NM- 300 K. Due to the larger dataset from <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> pristine NM- 300 K (more concentrations tested; thus, a NOEC and EC 10 could be determined), we decided to prepare the hazard assessment {{based on the results}} from <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> pristine NM- 300 K.|$|R
5|$|Two {{circling}} B-29s {{observed the}} <b>test,</b> <b>with</b> Shields again flying the lead plane.

5|$|Assigned to the Atlantic Transport Service, Orizaba {{carried over}} 15,000troops in six convoy trips to France {{before the end}} of World War I. In one such voyage, Orizaba’s {{executive}} officer, ordnance expert William Price Williamson, worked closely with Commander Richard Drace White—Orizaba’s commanding officer, himself an ordnance expert—to develop a workable depth charge launcher which would provide the transport with a measure of protection from enemy submarines. Williamson set about modifying a Lyle gun into a depth charge launcher, and successfully tested it on 16 August 1918. While attempting another <b>test</b> <b>with</b> an increased propellant charge the following day, a defective fuse exploded the depth charge prematurely, killing Williamson and three other sailors. White, four other officers, and twenty-two enlisted men were also wounded in the blast.|$|E
40|$|In 1981 {{and again}} in 1984, we {{performed}} multi-laboratory studies to develop quality control limits for susceptibility <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> 5 -micrograms trimethoprim disks.

5|$|Australia {{made three}} changes. Having taken only seven wickets {{in the first}} four Tests at an average of 61.00, off spinner Ian Johnson was {{replaced}} by leg spinner Doug Ring. Australia's second change was forced on them; the injured medium pacer Ernie Toshack was replaced by the opening batsman Sid Barnes, who had missed the Fourth <b>Test</b> <b>with</b> a rib injury. This meant Australia were playing with one extra batsman and one less frontline bowler. The final change was the return of first-choice wicket-keeper Don Tallon from injury and the omission of his deputy Ron Saggers.|$|E
5|$|Back in England, Trescothick {{was called}} upon to captain England after Michael Vaughan {{sustained}} a knee injury. Although other England captains had seemed to suffer a lack of batting form, the extra authority did not affect Trescothick, and he forged a good partnership with debutant Andrew Strauss against New Zealand. This understanding developed in the second <b>Test</b> <b>with</b> a first-wicket partnership of 153; Trescothick went on to score 132, his sixth Test century. Trescothick's partnerships with Strauss were to average 52.35 in 52 innings. His first century against the West Indies followed in the second Test, and Trescothick became {{the first player to}} make centuries in both innings of a Test match at Edgbaston, and the ninth England player to score a century in each innings of a Test match. Trescothick was again England's best One Day International batsman in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, scoring 261 runs in just four innings, including a century in the final; he also took his fourth ODI wicket.|$|E

5|$|England won {{the first}} <b>Test</b> <b>with</b> John Snow and David Brown {{claiming}} 13 wickets between them. A draw followed in Lord's, but England won the final match in a dramatic fashion. The West Indies in a seemingly strong position of 219/3 required 84 runs for victory. They suffered a late innings collapse however as Butcher, Sobers and Lloyd fell within 16 minutes, which ultimately led to England winning by 30 runs to win the series 2–0. It seemed that England would begin to dominate the West Indies, {{with many of the}} key West Indian players such as Butcher, Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith retiring in 1969. Illingworth would be the last England captain to win the Wisden Trophy for 31 years.|$|E
5|$|Following Brian Sellers resignation, Yardley was {{appointed}} Yorkshire captain {{at the start}} of the 1948 season. With his England commitments and other absences, he only played in 12 County Championship matches. He had not toured the West Indies with MCC in 1947–48, when Gubby Allen captained the side. However, Yardley resumed his leadership of England when Australia, captained by Bradman, toured the country without losing a match. Yardley led the MCC in an early match against the tourists, and captained England in a Test trial, but only played three other games, all for Yorkshire, before the first <b>Test,</b> <b>with</b> a top score of 46.|$|E
