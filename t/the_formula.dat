A set ofnew <b>formulae</b> for <b>the</b> inverse of a block Hankel (or block Toeplitz) matrix is given. <b>The</b> <b>formulae</b> are {{expressed}} in terms of certain matrix Pad 6 forms, which approximate a matrix power series associated with the block Hankel matrix. By using Frobenius-type identities between certain matrix Pad 6 forms, <b>the</b> inversion <b>formulae</b> are shown to generalize <b>the</b> <b>formulae</b> of Gohberg-Heinig and, in the scalar case, <b>the</b> <b>formulae</b> of Gohberg-Semencul and Gohberg-Krupnik. <b>The</b> new <b>formulae</b> have <b>the</b> significant advantage of requiring only that the block Hankel matrix itself be nonsingular. <b>The</b> other <b>formulae</b> require, in addition, that certain submatrices be nonsingular. Since effective algorithms for computing the required matrix Pad 6 forms are available, <b>the</b> <b>formulae</b> are practical. Indeed, some of the algorithms allow for the efficient calculation of the inverse not only of the given block Hankel matrix, but also of any nonsingular block principal minor...|$|R

In simplified form, this is analogous to a person walking on thin ice. When standing upright, a person's weight is concentrated {{at the bottom of}} their feet, funneling all of their weight into a small area. When lying down, a person's weight is distributed over a much larger area. This difference in weight distribution would allow a person to cross an area of ice while crawling that might otherwise collapse under their body weight while standing up. For an overweight truck to comply with <b>the</b> <b>formula,</b> more axles must be added, the distance between axles must be increased, or weight must be removed.|$|E
