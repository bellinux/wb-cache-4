English Shepherds can work all types of stock—from the meanest bull to baby chickens. Compared to others, they are prized above specialty herding breeds for being as gentle as possible or as tough as necessary with the stock.|$|E

25|$|Another anthropologist, Kristen Hawkes, has criticised both {{of these}} theories. On the one hand, {{opposing}} Harris, she says both that <b>the</b> <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> to get more male warriors {{would have been to}} have more females as child-bearers and that having more females in a village would increase the potential for marriage alliances with other villages. Against the procreative imperative theory she points out that the corollary to well-off elites such as those in northern India wanting to maximise reproduction is that poor people would want to minimise it and thus in theory should have practiced male infanticide, which it seems they did not.|$|E
25|$|A Thomas Reuters Foundation survey {{says that}} India {{is the fourth}} most {{dangerous}} {{place in the world}} for women to live in. Women belonging to any class, caste, creed or religion can be victims of this cruel form of violence and disfigurement, a premeditated crime intended to kill or maim permanently and act as a lesson to put a woman in her place. In India, acid attacks on women who dared to refuse a man's proposal of marriage or asked for a divorce are a form of revenge. Acid is cheap, easily available, and <b>the</b> <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> to destroy a woman's life. The number of acid attacks have been rising.|$|E
25|$|When the 183rd Division {{arrived in}} Flanders became an Eingreifdivisionen for Gruppe Ypren. The divisional {{artillery}} had been reorganised, with the medium and heavy guns participating in conventional artillery bombardments {{and the three}} battalions of Field Artillery Regiment 183 being divided between the three infantry regiments. Each infantry regiment received two assault batteries and a platoon of Reserve Engineer Battalion 16, to provide observed and direct fire. Training in the new role led to infantry companies being reorganised and new specialisms being introduced. The three platoons in each company became a rifle section, an assault group, a grenade-launcher troop and a light machine-gun section. The use of hand grenades became more important and coloured flares were used as <b>the</b> <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> to signal to the rear.|$|E

5000|$|Inbreeding is {{the mating}} of two closely related individuals. It {{is known as}} one of <b>the</b> <b>quickest</b> <b>ways</b> to [...] "fix" [...] desired {{characteristics}} into a bloodline of any species. The risk is that the inbreeding will reveal negative recessive characteristics; thus, [...] "closebreeding" [...] is usually avoided. Continued inbreeding over a series of generations also has a negative impact referred to as [...] "inbreeding depression." [...] The lines may become dominant for certain characteristics, but the offspring also tend to become weaker, less vigorous individuals than animals that are not as inbred.|$|R

25|$|It is {{nonsensical}} and counter-intuitive {{to believe}} that Nature (or God) created human life only {{to allow it to}} end after a definite period of time. A human being must be able to live indefinitely, or to put it in another way, it {{should not be allowed to}} die through ageing. There must be something inside us, that can be modified (perhaps at conception) that will shift the entire death pathway into another, parallel pathway, that will have no predetermined end. This ‘something’ is in fact, the evolutionary impetus to achieve higher levels of complexity in <b>the</b> <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> possible. There should be a way to enhance this process and accelerate our transition from the process of evolution by natural selection to a post-Darwinian, transhumanist domain where indefinite life-spans are the norm.|$|E

[...] The railroad, however, didn't {{understand the nature of}} Southern California's dry washes. [...] Local inhabitants warned the railroad of the dangers of building through such an area, that it could become a raging torrent of water, but the railroad built through the canyon anyway.|$|E
500|$|Five {{months after}} the American entry into World War I, Buckles sought to enlist in the armed forces. He was turned down by the Marine Corps for being too small, and by the Navy, which claimed that he had flat feet. He fared better with the Army, which {{accepted}} {{that he was an}} adult even though he looked no older than his 16 years. A sergeant advised that a middle initial would be helpful, so he adopted his uncle's name, [...] "Frank Woodruff Buckles". Another sergeant suggested that <b>the</b> <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> to the front lines would be to seek a position driving ambulances.|$|E

500|$|During the Song dynasty, {{for those}} without formal education, <b>the</b> <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> {{to power and}} the upper echelons of society was to join the military. [...] If a man had a {{successful}} career {{in the military and}} could boast of victorious battles, he had a sure path to success in politics. [...] Exam-drafted scholar-officials came mostly from prominent families and could rely on their clan status to advance their careers and place in society. Many Song military officers did not have this advantage, and owed their status in society to the advantage that military power granted them. [...] Many court eunuchs such as Tong Guan (1054–1126) were eager to enlist as officers in the central army since this was a means to elevate their position at court.|$|E
500|$|Roberts {{sent for}} Burnham soon after {{arriving}} in South Africa on the RMS Dunottar Castle. The American scout was prospecting near Skagway, Alaska, when he received the following telegram in January 1900: [...] "Lord Roberts appoints you on his personal staff as Chief of Scouts. If you accept, come at once <b>the</b> <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> possible." [...] Cape Town is {{at the opposite end}} of the globe from the Klondike, so Burnham left immediately. In an unusual step for a foreigner, Burnham received a command post from Roberts and the British Army rank of captain. Burnham reached the front just before the Battle of Paardeberg (February 1900). During the war, Burnham spent much time behind the Boer lines gathering information and blowing up railway bridges and tracks. He was captured twice (escaping both times), and also temporarily disabled at one point by near-fatal wounds.|$|E

The bombing amazed Otto Hahn and other German atomic scientists the British held at Farm Hall in Operation Epsilon. Hahn stated {{that he had not}} believed an atomic weapon [...] "would be possible for another twenty years"; Werner Heisenberg did not believe the news at first. Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker said [...] "I think it's dreadful of the Americans to have done it. I think it is madness on their part", but Heisenberg replied, [...] "One could equally well say 'That's <b>the</b> <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> of ending the war'". Hahn was grateful that the German project had not succeeded in developing [...] "such an inhumane weapon"; Karl Wirtz observed that even if it had, [...] "we would have obliterated London but would still not have conquered the world, and then they would have dropped them on us".|$|E

2500|$|The {{next major}} {{campaign}} was {{planned to be}} the liberation of Malaya. This was to involve an amphibious assault {{on the western side}} of Malaya codenamed Operation Zipper. The dropping of the atomic bombs in August 1945 forestalled Zipper, though some of its landings took place after the Japanese capitulation [...] of 15 August 1945 as <b>the</b> <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> of getting occupation troops into Malaya. Under Operation Jurist, Penang was retaken on 2 September 1945, while the Japanese garrison in Singapore formally surrendered on 12 September under Operation Tiderace. The rest of Malaya was liberated over the following weeks.|$|E

In this research, some ICC color management techniques were used and tested to investigate <b>the</b> <b>quicker</b> <b>ways</b> to achieve digital images with improved color reproduction accuracy, without visual editing.
