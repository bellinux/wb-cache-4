2500|$|Two {{forms of}} the disease of {{smallpox}} were recognised, now known {{to be due to}} two strains of the Variola virus. [...] <b>Those</b> <b>contracting</b> Variola minor had a greatly reduced risk of death – 1–2% – compared to <b>those</b> <b>contracting</b> Variola major with 30% mortality. [...] Infection via inhaled viral particles in droplets spread the infection more widely than the deliberate infection through a small skin wound. [...] The smaller, localised infection is adequate to stimulate the immune system to produce specific immunity to the virus, while requiring more generations of the virus to reach levels of infection likely to kill the patient. [...] The rising immunity terminates the infection. [...] So the twofold effect is to ensure the less fatal form of the disease is the one caught, and to give the immune system [...] the best start possible in combating it.|$|R
