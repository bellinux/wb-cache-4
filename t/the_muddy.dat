5|$|Because of <b>the</b> <b>muddy</b> subsoil of the site, {{work on the}} {{foundation}} continued past {{the work on the}} walls to 1581. In 1585, work on the first of the cathedral's chapels began and by 1615, the cathedral's walls reached to about half of their final height. Construction of the interior of the current cathedral began in 1623 and what is now the vestry was where Mass was conducted after the first church was finally torn down.|$|E
5|$|In {{the quarter}} final against Wolverhampton Wanderers, Arsenal {{initially}} went {{down by a}} goal but an equaliser was gained after a further 15 minutes by Billy Blyth. Both teams had good attacks on goal {{throughout the rest of}} the game, but the only further goal came following a header by Joe Hulme for Arsenal after a run and a cross from Jack Butler. The draw for the semi-final saw Arsenal play Southampton at Stamford Bridge. <b>The</b> <b>muddy</b> state of the pitch hampered the normal pace of the play shown by Arsenal, but both Buchan and Hulme scored for the gunners to Southampton's single response by Bill Rawlings. Southampton were denied two penalty appeals.|$|E
5|$|On the way, the car {{gets stuck}} in <b>the</b> <b>muddy</b> {{driveway}} {{in the middle}} of farm country. Homer and Marge rush into the nearest barn to avoid a sudden storm. A farmer discovers the barn door is open and suspects trespassers. He enters the barn, nearly catching Homer and Marge, who are hiding in the hay loft, but leaves after failing to locate them. When the coast is clear, Homer and Marge have inspired sexual intercourse in the hay loft.|$|E
50|$|Major tributaries of <b>the</b> Big <b>Muddy</b> include Beaucoup Creek, <b>the</b> Little <b>Muddy</b> River, Casey Creek, the Middle Fork of <b>the</b> Big <b>Muddy</b> and Crab Orchard Creek. Smaller tributaries include Town Creek, Kinkaid Creek, and Shoal Creek. The basin {{includes}} Kinkaid Lake, Rend Lake, Crab Orchard Lake, Devil's Kitchen Lake, Little Grassy Lake and Cedar Lake.|$|R
50|$|The {{watershed}} of <b>the</b> Big <b>Muddy</b> {{was covered}} by the Illinoian Glacier about 300,000 to 132,000 years before present. <b>The</b> Big <b>Muddy</b> basin formed after the retreat of that glacier.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Big <b>Muddy</b> River is a 156 mi {{river in}} {{southern}} Illinois. It joins the Mississippi River south of Murphysboro. <b>The</b> Big <b>Muddy</b> has been dammed near Benton, forming Rend Lake.|$|R
5|$|Solomon Sharp {{was born}} on August 22, 1787, at Abingdon, Washington County, Virginia. He was the fifth child and third son of Captain Thomas and Jean (Maxwell) Sharp, a Scottish woman. Through the male line he was a great-great-grandson of John Sharp, Archbishop of York. His father Thomas Sharp was {{a veteran of the}} Revolutionary War, {{participating}} in the Battle of King's Mountain. The family briefly moved to the area near Nashville, Tennessee, and to North Carolina, before settling permanently about 1795 at Russellville, Logan County, where they lived in a log cabin near <b>the</b> <b>Muddy</b> River.|$|E
5|$|The sister species {{relationship}} between the longfin and shortfin makos has been confirmed by several phylogenetic studies based on mitochondrial DNA. In turn, the closest relative of the two mako sharks is the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). Fossil teeth belonging to the longfin mako have been recovered from <b>the</b> <b>Muddy</b> Creek marl of the Grange Burn formation, south of Hamilton, Australia, and from Mizumani Group in Gifu Prefecture, Japan. Both deposits date to the Middle Miocene epoch (15–11 million years ago (Mya).|$|E
5|$|The wreck is {{generally}} intact although draped with snagged fishing nets. The aft turret, however, has fallen out off the ship. The vertical {{position of the}} wreck has inspired a new theory of her loss by nautical archaeologist Vello Mäss. He believes that Rusalka was taking on water forward, perhaps from a leak or through ventilation hatches and was bow-heavy when her captain {{decided to make a}} turn, possibly to return to Reval, and the ship capsized during the turn with her engines still running. Her forward speed and flooded forward hull meant that she descended vertically and drove her hull into <b>the</b> <b>muddy</b> sea bottom.|$|E

5|$|In August 1994, DGC {{announced}} that a double album titled Verse Chorus Verse featuring live material from throughout the group's career on one CD and its MTV Unplugged performance on another was due for release that November. However, Novoselic and Grohl found assembling the live material so soon after Cobain's death to be too emotionally overwhelming. Grohl founded the Foo Fighters, and Novoselic {{turned his attention to}} political activism. With the career-spanning live portion postponed, MTV Unplugged in New York debuted at number one on the Billboard charts upon release in November 1994. A few weeks later the group's first full-length video, Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!, was released. The following year, MTV Unplugged in New York earned Nirvana a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. In 1996, DGC finally issued a Nirvana live album, From <b>the</b> <b>Muddy</b> Banks of the Wishkah, which became the third Nirvana release in a row to debut {{at the top of the}} Billboard album chart.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{other birds}} can be seen, {{especially}} during the spring and autumn migration. Sand martins (Riparia riparia) arrive early and can usually be seen hawking over the water for insects in {{the second or third}} week of March. Flocks of tits (Paridae), swallows (Hirundinidae) and terns (Sternidae) can regularly be seen. Waders, such as lapwings (Vanellus vanellus), dunlin (Calidris alpina) and common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), are attracted to <b>the</b> <b>muddy</b> shores if the water level drops in autumn. By midwinter up to 55,000 gulls, mostly black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) and common gull (Larus canus), may be roosting. Good numbers of reed warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) and sedge warblers (A. schoenobaenus) nest in the fringing reeds, along with grebes (Podicipedidae) and Eurasian coots (Fulica atra).|$|E
5|$|Reported {{details about}} the event, such as water boiling in <b>the</b> <b>muddy</b> crater for ten minutes from {{the heat of the}} impact, {{presented}} a problem for experts. Because the impact site is at a high altitude of more than , the meteoroid may not have been slowed down as much as it ordinarily would have been by passage through the Earth’s denser lower atmosphere, and kinetic energy at impact may have been unusually high for a terrestrial impact of an object of this size and mass. Most larger meteorites are cold in their bulk mass when they land on Earth, since their heated outer layers ablate from the objects before impacting. It was later confirmed that the meteorite contained a large amount of iron and possessed magnetic properties common to similar metallic objects, which contributed to its capacity to retain heat during atmospheric entry.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Big <b>Muddy</b> {{crossing}} {{was a major}} {{limitation on}} this road. Although bridges over <b>the</b> Big <b>Muddy</b> existed in <b>the</b> area in the early 19th century, there is no reference to a bridge on the Lusk's Ferry Road. Even {{if there was a}} bridge, <b>the</b> Big <b>Muddy</b> is notable for its broad, flat floodplain. A true all weather route would have required long causeways over the floodplain that would have been more than a mile long.|$|R
50|$|The {{direction}} of the road was controlled by several factors. Out of Kaskaskia, the road went north toward the headwaters of Marys River, avoiding a river crossing. The road then headed east to cross <b>the</b> Big <b>Muddy</b> River as far upstream as possible consistent with a direct route to the southeast. After crossing <b>the</b> Big <b>Muddy,</b> <b>the</b> road seems to aim straight for the most direct pass over the Shawnee Hills.|$|R
50|$|Goshen Road {{generally}} {{followed the}} Saline River watershed in a northwesterly direction until it met <b>the</b> Big <b>Muddy</b> River/Saline River divide, {{which was also}} the Mississippi River/Ohio River divide. It then followed that divide in a northwesterly direction, avoiding a crossing of the swamps around <b>the</b> Big <b>Muddy</b> River. <b>The</b> road finally crossed <b>the</b> Big <b>Muddy</b> watershed in northern Jefferson County. The road then crossed the Kaskaskia Bottoms, {{which could not be}} avoided, on a fairly direct line toward the Goshen Settlement, in the Glen Carbon area.|$|R
5|$|Southlake Moor {{is another}} SSSI, which forms {{part of an}} {{extensive}} grazing marsh and ditch system. When conditions in the River Parrett are suitable, the moor can be deliberately flooded in winter by opening a sluice in the river's floodbank. Some 96species of aquatic and bankside vascular plant species have been recorded on Southlake Moor, including the greater water-parsnip (Sium latifolium). When the moor is flooded it can be occupied by large numbers of wildfowl; up to 22,000 wigeon (Anas penelope), 250Bewick's swan (Cygnus bewickii) and good numbers of pochard (Aythya ferina), teal (Anas crecca) and tufted duck (Aythya fuligula). Signs of European otters (Lutra lutra) are regularly seen on <b>the</b> <b>muddy</b> banks of the River Parrett. The ditches {{on the east side}} of the site are populated by palmate newts (Triturus helveticus).|$|E
5|$|The New Zealanders had {{a number}} of preparatory hurdles to {{overcome}} before the battle. The men of the Rifle Brigade had, for the previous few weeks, been carrying out engineering work for II ANZAC Corps and were fatigued. The ongoing rainfall affected both the roads by which the division had to move to its starting positions and the placement of the supporting artillery. <b>The</b> <b>muddy</b> ground did not provide a stable platform for the guns and howitzers. Furthermore, the artillery barrage targeting the barbed wire emplacements protecting the strongpoints on the slopes of Belluvue Spur failed to destroy them, a fact determined by scouts on 11 October. Once this information reached the brigade commanders, Braithwaite and A. E. Stewart (who took over command of the Rifle Brigade following Young's wounding), they pressed Russell for cancellation of the attack; this was refused.|$|E
5|$|The art {{historian}} Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson posits that {{the painting is}} informed by the progressive style of French realists such as Rosa Bonheur and Gustave Courbet. She concedes {{that there is no}} documentary evidence to suggest Predić was influenced by Courbet's depictions of peasant life, but notes that the latter's work was in the public domain at the time Happy Brothers was created and was quite popular throughout Europe. Filipovitch-Robinson believes that Predić rejected the precision and linearism of both Academic and Biedermeier art, and, as Courbet would have done, used heavily textured brushstrokes to define the roughness of <b>the</b> <b>muddy</b> road. She also draws parallels between the painting and Courbet's Peasants of Flagey, which was shown at the Paris Salon of 1850–51 alongside The Stone Breakers and A Burial At Ornans.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Big <b>Muddy</b> Ranch Airport is also located there.|$|R
50|$|Nashville {{is located}} on Nashville Creek, at the {{headwaters}} of Little Crooked Creek, which flows northwest into the Kaskaskia River. Just to the southeast of Nashville is the headwaters of Beaucoup Creek, which flows south into <b>the</b> Big <b>Muddy</b> River. Nashville is thus situated next to <b>the</b> Kaskaskia/Big <b>Muddy</b> divide.|$|R
50|$|Just west of DuQuoin, the Lusk Ferry Road {{turned toward}} the southeast, near {{the point where it}} entered T6S, R1W, running about six miles (10 km) toward Jackson County and <b>the</b> Big <b>Muddy</b> River. Somewhere close to <b>the</b> Big <b>Muddy,</b> Chief DuQuoin met his defeat {{at the hands of the}} Shawnee.|$|R
5|$|The fourteenth {{stage was}} memorable for its extreme weather, most notably {{on the final}} climb of the Gavia Pass. Overnight, {{a large amount of}} snow had {{accumulated}} on the Gavia, but the roads were cleared in time for the riders. Despite the cold and adverse weather forecast, the patron, Vincenzo Torriani, decided {{to go ahead with the}} stage. As snow fell on the riders climbing <b>the</b> <b>muddy</b> roads of the Gavia, Hampsten attacked at the base of the mountain but was chased by Erik Breukink, who eventually caught up and passed the American with seven kilometers to go. Although Breukink won the stage, Hampsten made the bigger story by becoming the first American to don the maglia rosa in the history of the Giro d'Italia.|$|E
5|$|The smooth toadfish {{is found}} along Australia's eastern and {{southeast}} coast, from Moreton Bay in southeastern Queensland to Port Lincoln in South Australia {{as well as}} Kangaroo Island and Tasmania. It {{is one of the}} most abundant fishes in <b>the</b> <b>muddy</b> areas of Port Philip Bay. It generally lives in shallow water less than 3m (10ft) deep, often over mudflats in estuaries. In areas of seagrass beds, smooth toadfish are more commonly found in sand areas bordering on the seagrass patches. They are more commonly found in seagrass patches in water less than 1.5m (5ft) deep rather than deeper water of 3.5–6m (11–20ft). A South Australian field study on wrack and associated fauna found that the smooth toadfish was associated with larger volumes and aggregations containing green algae.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a boom in}} {{skyscraper}} {{construction in}} Chicago from 1888 onwards. By 1893, Chicago had built 12 skyscrapers between 16 and 20 stories tall, tightly clustered {{in the center of}} the financial district. Chicago's skyscrapers, however, were constrained by the contemporary limits of steel-frame design and <b>the</b> <b>muddy</b> sub-soil in the city, which together limited most of their skyscrapers to around 16 or 17 stories. Chicago's skyscrapers rapidly became tourist destinations for the views of the wider city they provided from their upper floors and as attractive sites in their own right. Tourists were advised to hire cabs for street tours of the skyscrapers – by lying back in the cab, they would be able to safely take in the tops of the tall buildings.|$|E
