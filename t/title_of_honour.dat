5|$|From early on, ascetics {{have played}} a major role in the Swaminarayan sect. They {{contribute}} towards growth and development of the movement, encouraging people to follow a pious and religious life. Tradition maintains that Swaminarayan initiated 500 ascetics as paramhansas in a single night. Paramhansa is a <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour</b> sometimes applied to Hindu spiritual teachers who are regarded as having attained enlightenment. Paramhansas were the highest order of sannyasi in the sect. Prominent paramhansas included Muktanand Swami, Gopalanand Swami, Brahmanand Swami, Gunatitanand Swami, Premanand Swami, Nishkulanand Swami, and Nityanand Swami.|$|E
25|$|On 7 November 1951, Johannes Henricus van Maarseveen, Minister of the Interior, {{suddenly}} died. Prime Minister Drees {{appealed to}} Beel {{to return to}} office. Again reluctantly, Beel accepted Prime Minister Drees' offer. He also held the function of Minister of the Interior in the next Drees-cabinet after the elections of 1952. In July 1956 Beel asked that he be allowed to resign from government to become, as a private citizen, chairman of a committee of three wise men that was requested by Queen Juliana and the Consort Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld to help solve problems pertaining to the Royal Family. The problems were related to faith healer Greet Hofmans, whom the Queen had invited to the royal palace in order to cure her youngest daughter, who had been born half blind in 1947. The renowned German magazine Der Spiegel had accused Mrs. Hofmans of playing a 'Rasputin' role in the Royal Family. Within a month the committee had fulfilled its task by writing a secret report, which banished the sensitive affair from publicity. Three months later Beel was appointed Minister of State, a prestigious <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In the pre-colonial era, Moors from Mauritania {{who came}} to settle in the Serer kingdoms such as the Kingdom of Sine, etc., were ill treated by their Serer masters. If a Moor dies in a Serer kingdom, his body was dragged {{out of the country}} and left for the {{vultures}} to feast on if there is no family or friend to claim the body and bury it elsewhere. [...] They were also never accompanied by grave goods. [...] No matter how long a Mauritanian Moor has lived in the area as a migrant, he could never achieve high status within the Serer aristocracy. [...] The best position he could ever wish for within Serer high society was to work as a Bissit (Bissik). Apart from spying for the Serer Kings, the Bissit's [...] main job was to be a clown - for the sole entertainment of the Serer King, the Serer aristocracy and the common people. [...] He was expected to dance in ceremonies before the king and liven up the king's mood and the king's subjects. [...] This position was always given to the Moors. [...] It was a humiliating job and not a <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour.</b> According to some, the history of this position goes back to an early Moor in Serer country who had a child by his own daughter.|$|E

I fear very much that Morgiana's mother thought Mr. Slang an exceedingly gentlemanlike and agreeable person; besides, she was eager to have his good opinion of Mrs. Walker's singing.|$|E

60|$|The {{emperor and}} his whole court {{stood on the}} shore, expecting the issue of this great adventure.

The emperor concluded me to be drowned, and that the enemy’s fleet was approaching in a hostile manner: but he was soon eased of his fears; for the channel growing shallower every step I made, I came in a short time within hearing, and holding up the end of the cable, by which the fleet was fastened, I cried in a loud voice, “Long live the most puissant king of Lilliput!” This great prince received me at my landing with all possible encomiums, and created me a nardac upon the spot, which is the highest <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour</b> among them.|$|E
6000|$|Bishop's Crossing is a {{small village}} lying ten miles in a south-westerly {{direction}} from Liverpool. Here {{in the early seventies}} there settled a doctor named Aloysius Lana. Nothing was known locally either of his antecedents or of the reasons which had prompted him to come to this Lancashire hamlet. Two facts only were certain about him; the one that he had gained his medical qualification with some distinction at Glasgow; the other that he came undoubtedly of a tropical race, and was so dark that he might almost have had a strain of the Indian in his composition. His predominant features were, however, European, and he possessed a stately courtesy and carriage which suggested a Spanish extraction. A swarthy skin, raven-black hair, and dark, sparkling eyes under a pair of heavily-tufted brows made a strange contrast to the flaxen or chestnut rustics of England, and the newcomer was soon known as [...] "The Black Doctor of Bishop's Crossing." [...] At first it was a term of ridicule and reproach; as the years went on it became a <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour</b> which was familiar to the whole countryside, and extended far beyond the narrow confines of the village.|$|E
6000|$|There {{is reason}} to think that these titles were {{originally}} proper names. Not only do we see among the Egyptians, where Pharaoh was synonymous with king, and among the Romans, where to be Cæsar meant to be Emperor, that the proper names of the greatest men were transferred to their successors, and so became class names; but in the Scandinavian mythology we may trace a human <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>honour</b> up to the proper name of a divine personage. In Anglo-Saxon bealdor, or baldor, means Lord; and Balder {{is the name of the}} favourite of Odin's sons--the gods who with him constitute the Teutonic Pantheon. How these names of honour became general is easily understood. The relatives of the primitive kings--the grandees described by Selden as having names formed on those of the gods, and shown by this to be members of the divine race--necessarily shared in the epithets, such as Lord, descriptive of superhuman relationships and nature. Their ever-multiplying offspring inheriting these, gradually rendered them comparatively common. And then they came to be applied to every man of power: partly from the fact that, in these early days when men conceived divinity simply as a stronger kind of humanity, great persons could be called by divine epithets with but little exaggeration; partly from the fact that the unusually potent were apt to be considered as unrecognised or illegitimate descendants of [...] "the strong, the destroyer, the powerful one;" [...] and partly, also, from compliment and the desire to propitiate.|$|E
