40|$|High-intensity {{discharge}} (HID) lamps {{are becoming}} popular substitutes for halogen lamps in automotive headlamps {{because of the}} high lumen/watt ratio and the color of the light. In this paper, a ballast (integrated with a voltage multiplier circuit in the secondary winding of the dc converter transformer) with dimming control is presented. The proposed circuit not only eliminates one auxiliary winding but also reduces the voltage across the switch on the primary side and consequently permits the selection of switches with a lower rating. A brief review of the HID circuits is done and compared with the proposed circuit. Experimental results from the prototype are presented. This paper also presents different methods of dimming the automotive HID lamps based on analog and digital control and discusses the relative merits of each of the methods. <b>The</b> <b>dimming</b> <b>control</b> is implemented using both the methods, and experimental results are presented. It is envisaged that <b>the</b> <b>dimming</b> <b>control</b> will provide some flexibility to drivers in the control of HID lamps to suit the driving conditions in the modern cities that are very well lit at night. This paper investigates the merits of each method and discusses the practical issues for implementing such controls. Department of Electrical EngineeringAuthor name used in this publication: K. W. E.

40|$|A two-stage, {{two-wire}} TRIAC dimmable {{electronic ballast}} for fluorescent lamps {{is presented in}} this paper. It is constructed by using a flyback converter as the input power factor corrector to supply a half-bridge series-resonant parallel-loaded inverter to ballast the lamp. The flyback converter is operated in discontinuous conduction mode so that the filtered input current profile is same as the TRIAC-controlled voltage waveform. The switches in the inverter are switched at a constant frequency slightly higher than the resonant frequency of the resonant tank. Based on the constant average input current characteristics of <b>the</b> inverter, <b>dimming</b> operation is simply achieved by pulse-width-modulation control {{of the magnitude of}} the flyback converter output voltage. No synchronization network is required between the input and output stages. In addition, a novel power equalization scheme is developed so that the dc link voltage (and hence the lamp power) is in linear relationships with the firing angle of the TRIAC. The average output voltage of <b>the</b> <b>dimmer</b> <b>controls</b> <b>the</b> equalized flyback converter output voltage. Modeling, analysis, and design of the ballast will be described.

40|$|The {{light-emitting}} diode (LED) VI characteristics of temperature dependence and devices variation make LED be current imbalanced when parallel-connected LEDs are {{powered by the}} common voltage source. Current imbalance will cause fast degradation or even failure in some LEDs that should be avoided in LED applications. This paper proposes a current sharing circuit based on the pulse width modulation (PWM) of a common bus voltage to realize the required averaged current. If it is in balance, a small duty cycle will necessitate a large LED on-time current, which may cause temporal overheat and low luminous efficacy of LEDs.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the field-measured energy performance of two common types of daylight-linked lighting control systems, continuous dimming and automatic on/off installed in two existing large atrium spaces located in Canada. The daylighting performance was evaluated {{based on the}} daylight contribution to the indoor illuminance {{and the amount of}} electrical lighting displaced by daylighting via the daylight-linked lighting control systems. Measured daylighting contribution to the space indicates that significant lighting energy savings can be achieved in atrium spaces if the daylight-linked lighting control system is appropriately selected, installed and commissioned throughout its existence. Results extrapolated from measurements collected during summer and winter indicate that as installed, the continuous dimming lighting control system provides 46 % annual savings in electrical lighting consumption, while the automatic on/off saves between 11 - 17 % in lighting energy.
