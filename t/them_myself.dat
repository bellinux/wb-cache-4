2500|$|Le Pen {{has made}} several provocative {{statements}} concerning the Holocaust {{which have been}} interpreted by the legal system as constituting Holocaust denial.

When told they were looking for, [...] "Morphine, Heroin, Pethidine and the like", Adams was surprised: [...] "Oh, that group. You will find none here. I haven't any. I very seldom ever use them", he said. When Hannam asked for Adams' Dangerous Drugs Register – the record of those ordered and used – Adams responded: [...] "I don't know what you mean. I keep no register." [...] He had not kept one since 1949. When shown a list of {{dangerous}} drugs he had prescribed Morrell, and asked who administered them, Adams said, [...] "I did nearly all. Perhaps the nurses gave some but mostly me" [...] – contradicting what the nurses' notebooks would show during his trial.

2500|$|During {{the battles}} with Villa, Obregón had {{his right arm}} blown off. The blast nearly killed him, and he {{attempted}} to put himself out of his misery and fired his pistol to accomplish that. [...] The aide de camp who had cleaned his gun had neglected to put bullets in the weapon. In a wry story he told about himself, he joined {{in the search for}} his missing arm. [...] "I was helping <b>them</b> <b>myself,</b> because it's not so easy to abandon such a necessary thing as an arm." [...] The searchers had no luck. A comrade reached into his pocket and raised a gold coin. Obregón concluded the story, saying [...] "And then everyone saw a miracle: the arm came forth from who knows where, and come skipping up to where the gold azteca [...] was elevated; it reached up and grasped it in its fingers--lovingly--That {{was the only way to}} get my lost arm to appear." [...] The arm was subsequently embalmed and then put in the monument to Obregón on the site of where he was assassinated in 1928. Obregón always wore clothing tailored to show that he had lost his arm in battle, a visible sign of his sacrifice to Mexico.|$|E
