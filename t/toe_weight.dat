40|$|AbstractToe {{weight is}} widely {{employed}} in the earth and rockfill dam reinforcement projects, but the theoretical analysis of {{its impact on the}} earth and rockfill dam is very vague and the sizes of the <b>toe</b> <b>weight</b> block are mostly determined empirically. In this paper, it researches and discusses the impact of weight block in front of the reservoir dam to the static and dynamic characteristics of earth and rockfill dam through combining the theoretical calculation with the numerical simulation analysis methods based on the specific engineering example. It shows that the length and height of the <b>toe</b> <b>weight</b> block together with the internal friction angle of the material greatly affect the stability of the dam. The length, height and the economic height ratio of the dam are obtained by optimization. The <b>toe</b> <b>weight</b> block length should be 0. 45 - 0. 55 times the length of the dam. The <b>toe</b> <b>weight</b> block height should be at least larger than 0. 19 times the dam height. The larger is the height of <b>toe</b> <b>weight</b> block, the larger the safety coefficient is. But the <b>toe</b> <b>weight</b> block height should not be larger than 0. 3 times the dam height. Placing weight block in front of the reservoir dam can effectively improve the initial stress of dam foundation, and enhance the capability to resist the liquefaction...|$|E
50|$|In some cases, {{failures}} are triggered as {{a result}} of undercutting of the slope by a river, especially during a flood. This undercutting serves both to increase the gradient of the slope, reducing stability, and to remove <b>toe</b> <b>weighting,</b> which also decreases stability. For example, in Nepal this process is often seen after a glacial lake outburst flood, when toe erosion occurs along the channel. Immediately after the passage of flood waves extensive landsliding often occurs. This instability can continue to occur for a long time afterwards, especially during subsequent periods of heavy rain and flood events.|$|R
50|$|Artiodactyla {{refers to}} the mammal order of even-toed {{ungulates}} the group containing cattle, deer, camels, giraffes, antelope, goats, sheep, pigs and hippopotamuses. If the animal has even number of <b>toes,</b> the <b>weight</b> is borne equally by {{the third and fourth}} toe. The shape of the astragalus is another key feature which has a double-pulley structure in artiodactyls, giving the foot greater flexibility.|$|R
5000|$|Pitted keratolysis (also {{known as}} [...] "Keratolysis plantare sulcatum," [...] "Keratoma plantare sulcatum," [...] and [...] "Ringed keratolysis") is a non-contagious skin {{infection}} {{that can be}} caused by wearing tight or restricting footwear and excessive sweating. The infection is characterized by craterlike pits {{on the surface of the}} feet and <b>toes,</b> particularly <b>weight</b> bearing areas. Treatment consists of the application of topical antibiotics. Pitted Keratolysis is caused by bacteria, which thrive in these environments.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Male {{broilers}} (n = 416) {{were used}} to compare the efficacy of providing dietary phytase either as a commercial supplement or as a recombinant protein in transformed soybean. From 7 to 21 d of age, broilers were fed a basal diet containing 0. 20 % nonphytate P (nP) with additional supplementation by fungal phytase as Natuphos or as raw transformed soybeans express-ing recombinant phytase at 400, 800, or 1, 200 U/kg. For comparison, broilers were also fed the basal diet containing 0. 08, 0. 16, or 0. 24 added nP. The basal diet was fed as the negative control. Diets were consumed ad libitum as a mash. All excreta were collected from each pen from 18 through 20 d of age, and the birds were killed at 21 d of age. Supplementing the basal diet with nP linearly increased body weight gain, feed efficiency, feed intake, <b>toe</b> ash <b>weight</b> and percentage, and tibia shear force and energy. Phosphorus digestibility decreased linearly as nP level increased, but P excretion increased. Dietary phytase linearly increased growth rate, feed intake, <b>toe</b> ash <b>weight</b> and percentage, tibia shear force and energy, and P digestibility, whereas excretion was decreased. Except for P digestibility, {{there was no difference in}} efficacy of responses for perfor-mance, bone mineralization, and P excretion between the two sources of phytase. It appears from this study that phytase can improve growth performance of broilers fed low nP diets when provided either as a commercial supplement or in the form of transformed seeds...|$|R

500|$|Like other theropods, dromaeosaurids were bipedal; that is, {{they walked}} on their hind legs.

40|$|This article defines minimalist {{running shoes}} and {{examines}} physiological, biomechanical, and injury rate differences when running in conventional versus minimalist running shoes. A minimalist shoe {{is one that}} provides “minimal interference with the natural movement of the foot, because of its high flexibility, low heel to <b>toe</b> drop, <b>weight</b> and stack height, {{and the absence of}} motion control and stability devices. ” Most studies indicate that running in minimalist shoes results in a lower physiological energy cost than running in conventional shoes, likely because of the lower weight of the minimalist shoe. Most individuals running in conventional shoes impact the ground heel first (rearfoot strike pattern), whereas most people running in minimalist shoes tend to strike with the front of the foot (forefoot strike pattern). The rate at which force is developed on ground impact (i. e., the loading rate) is generally higher when running in conventional versus minimalist shoes. Findings from studies that have looked at associations between injuries and foot strike patterns or injuries and loading rates are conflicting, so it is not clear if these factors influence injury rates; more research is needed. Better-designed prospective studies indicate that bone stress injuries and the overall injury incidence are higher in minimalist shoes during the early weeks (10 – 12 weeks) of transition to this type of footwear. Longer-term studies are needed to define injury rates once runners are fully transitioned to minimalist shoes. At least one longer-term minimalist-shoe investigation is ongoing and, hopefully, will be published soon...|$|R
5000|$|The hoof is {{the tip of}} a toe of an {{ungulate}} mammal, {{strengthened by}} a thick horny (keratin) covering. The hoof consists of a hard or rubbery sole, and a hard wall formed by a thick nail rolled around the tip of the <b>toe.</b> The <b>weight</b> of the animal is normally borne by both the sole and the edge of the hoof wall. Hooves grow continuously, and are constantly worn down by use. In most modern ungulates, the radius and ulna are fused {{along the length of the}} forelimb; early ungulates, such as the arctocyonids, did not share this unique skeletal structure. The fusion of the radius and ulna prevents an ungulate from rotating its forelimb. Since this skeletal structure has no specific function in ungulates, it is considered a homologous characteristic that ungulates share with other mammals. This trait would have been passed down from a common ancestor. While the two orders of ungulates colloquial names are based on the number of toes of their members ("odd-toed" [...] for the perissodactyls and [...] "even-toed" [...] for the terrestrial artiodactyls), it is not an accurate reason they are grouped. Tapirs have four toes in the front, yet they are members of the [...] "odd-toed" [...] order; peccaries and modern cetaceans are members of the [...] "even-toed" [...] order, yet peccaries have three toes in the front and whales are an extreme example as they have flippers instead of hooves. Scientists had classified them according to the distribution of their <b>weight</b> to their <b>toes.</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{total of}} 7, 428 turkey poults {{were used in}} two {{experiments}} designed to evaluate the interrelated effects of stocking density, lighting, toe clipping, and intermingling the sexes. Mor-tality was unaffected by stocking density. Although high stocking density {{had the effect of}} reduc-ing body weight and percent Grade A carcasses, monetary returns were highest per unit of floor area for birds grown under high stocking density conditions. There was no apparent monetary ad-vantage in extending the slaughter age from 98 to 119 days for males or by rearing the sexes sepa-rately to 14 weeks of age. Body weights of birds grown under low intensity, green light were heaviest but this was not reflected in higher monetary returns. There was no beneficial effect on the biological traits resulting from <b>toe</b> clipping. Body <b>weight</b> was adversely affected by toe clipping but this was not reflected in reduced monetary returns. In a windowless building, adequately venti-lated, with the capability of maintaining low internal temperatures (not exceeding 21 C), high stocking density and low light intensity may be useful in the conservation of both heat and light energy...|$|R

30|$|A {{systematic}} {{database search}} was employed using PubMed online {{as the primary}} database. In addition, Google Scholar and Scopus were also examined as complimentary databases. The terms “(Transition OR Habituation OR Training) AND (Minimalist OR Simulated Barefoot OR Barefoot Running Shoes) AND (Shoes OR Footwear) AND (Running)” were employed in the search strategy. The search was performed in February 2017. The literature search and screening of the abstracts were completed by the authors independently. Papers that both authors judged to meet the following a priori conditions and PICOS inclusion criteria were included and read in full: (1) the methods included individuals with previous running experience, of which their experience level was clearly reported; (2) the study prescribed specific details for transitioning to MFW including the proposed exposure to MFW, either within the paper or as an available resource; (3) the study included the use of “true minimal” shoes, based on the definition “Footwear providing minimal interference with the natural movement of the foot due to its high flexibility, low heel to <b>toe</b> drop, <b>weight</b> and stack height, {{and the absence of}} motion control and stability devices” [19]; and (4) only longitudinal prospective studies were included; (5) only full-length articles were included. The review procedure was based on guidelines from the PRISMA statement [20]. Both authors assessed the risk of bias for all included articles with {{a modified version of the}} Downs and Black Quality Index [21], used previously for systematic reviews in this area [22]. Definitions of levels of evidence were guided by Hall et al. [23]. The number of high-quality studies that examined the same variable and found a similar outcome decided the following levels: strong, n[*]≥[*] 3; moderate, n[*]=[*] 2; or limited, n[*]=[*] 1. Limited (n[*]=[*] 2 [*]+ studies) and very limited (n[*]=[*] 1 study) evidence was reported for low-quality studies with similar outcomes. Quality was assessed by the risk of bias score from the Downs and Black Quality Index, where studies that scored from 0 to 6 were classified as “high risk of bias” and very low quality, from 7 to 13 as “moderate risk of bias” and low quality, and from 14 to 20 as “low risk of bias” and high quality.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Ecstasy or 3, 4 -Methylenedioxymethamphetamine(MDMA) is a psychotropic and {{addictive}} {{substance that}} young people tend {{to use it to}} reduce their psychological and social tensions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the influence of ecstasy consumption on the fetus of pregnant mice during the second and third weeks of pregnancy. Methods: 20 adult female mice were randomly selected(5 for control group and 15 for experimental group). Two intraperitoneal injections of ecstasy(5 mg/Kg) was used in the experimental group, on 7 th and 14 th days of pregnancy, while, in the control group, only distilled water was injected intraperitoneally. On 18 th day of pregnancy, mice were placed in separate cages. The condition of palate, skull, external ear, eye, fingers and <b>toes</b> and sindactily, <b>weight,</b> and fertility potentials of newborn mice were studied using stereo microscope. Results: From 163 newborn mice in two groups, no abnormalities were observed in the skull and the external ear. There wasn’t any significant difference between male and female sex ratio between two groups (p=. 08). Hypoplasia of the fingers was significantly different between the two groups(p< 0. 001). The frequency of sindactily was not significantly different between two groups(p= 0. 11). Female fertility potential was significantly different between two groups(p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Adminstration of ecstasy during pregnancy may affect the organogenesis and fertility potential of newborn mice. Therefore, more studies are needed in this regard...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Data on {{bodyweight}} and 11 body {{measurements were}} taken on 51 Fulani and 101 Yoruba ecotype chicken from two central poultry markets: Ilorin {{in the middle}} belt and Ibadan in the southwest region of Nigeria, respectively. The aim was to provide baseline information on size characteristics of Fulani and Yoruba ecotype chickens, differentiate between the types and use the morphometrical variables for a preliminary assessment of type and function. Results showed that least square means of live weight, wing and shank length, body, thigh and toe length, beak length and breast breadth of the Fulani ecotype were generally higher (P < 0. 01) {{than those of the}} Yoruba ecotype. The males were also superior (P < 0. 01) to the females for comb, wing, shank length and breast breadth while live <b>weight,</b> <b>toe</b> and thigh length also differ (P< 0. 05) within each ecotype. Thecomb of males was more prominent than those of the females. Coefficients of variation were very small signifying a monotypic condition and an almost equal opportunity of selection for type based on body parameters of the two ecotype chickens. The Fulani ecotype was bigger than the Yoruba ecotype chicken. The significantly longer (p< 0. 05) bodies of the Fulani suggests a departure in function between the genotypes. The Fulani chickens appear more closely suited for egg production than the Yoruba type. Their potential for developing a more adapted commercial stock and genetic improvement of the chickens for the region andother implications of type on function are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Between March 2000 and May 2001 138 Australasian Harriers were trapped, {{individually}} banded, measured, sexed and aged. Morphometric {{measurements and}} molecular sexing methods {{were used to}} identify {{the best way to}} accurately assign gender to harriers. Morphometric sexing is 96 % accurate when based on six measurements; weight, back talon, culmen, middle talon, hallux and <b>toe.</b> Of these, <b>weight,</b> back talon and culmen are the most reliable indicators of sex. Molecular sexing applied to DNA from 11 birds proved to be an accurate means of sexing and is a first for this species. Mammal (61. 2 %) and bird (36. 2 %) prey dominate the diet of the harrier at Pukepuke Lagoon, especially lagomorphs and small passerines. Mammalian prey in pellets peaked in August and again in December, was highest in the early-breeding season and lowest in the non-breeding season. Birds were most frequent in pellets in the non-breeding season (peaking in May and June) and lease in the early-breeding season (Ausust). Other prey averaged only 5. 9 % of the total prey in pellets over the year. Harriers are generalist feeders of live prey and carrion, but may become specialised when prey abundance and availability in the environment is high. Impact of harriers on economic, recreational, and threatened endemic species is discussed. Eight harriers were radio-tagged and tracked intensively over seven months. Male home ranges averaged 405. 51 ha in the breeding season and 669. 71 ha in the non-breeding season. In females, but not in males, there was significant difference between seasonal ranges. Range sizes and shapes varied between all individual with no common pattern emerging. Breeding season range overlaps were scarce, but tended to be large and associated with closely nesting pairs. In the non-breeding season there were large overlaps in ranges of most birds. Range overlap was not related to age or sex. Temporal ranges overlapped little for most birds, except those nesting close together. For males and females pasture accounted for over 70 % of the habitat in all ranges and seasons, but the birds utilised only 38 % of pasture. Swamp accounted for less than 5 % of the total habitat but was the most frequently used by harriers (41 %). Three communal roosts were observed for 27 evenings and six mornings. The earliest harrier, and the latest, landed in a roost 90 minuted and four minutes respectively before complete darkness. On average there were 39 minutes between the first and last harriers to land, and most landed shortly after sun moved below the horizon. The highest light reading for a harrier landing in a roost was 715. 1 lux and the lowest 0. 3 lux. High numbers of birds over roosts was associated with poor weather (wind and rain). Both the breeding and non-breeding season produced fairly similar positive linear increases in bird numbers as light intensity decreased. Differing habitat type and composition at the three roosts did not affect the general behaviour of harriers in response to changing light intensity and weather conditions. In New Zealand communal roosting by harriers may relate to a combination of foraging, social and resource pressures within the local area...|$|R
