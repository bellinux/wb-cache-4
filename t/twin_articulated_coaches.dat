5000|$|The {{train was}} made in the year of King George V's Silver Jubilee, and was painted silver throughout. It was {{composed}} of two twin-set <b>articulated</b> <b>coaches,</b> and one triple-set; seven coaches in all.|$|R
50|$|Stagecoach ordered another {{batch of}} Neoplan Skyliners, which entered service with Megabus in early 2005. These {{replaced}} the <b>articulated</b> <b>coaches</b> used between London and Scotland, and also Leyland Olympians {{on some other}} longer distance services.|$|R
50|$|Muni's active ETB fleet {{consists}} of <b>articulated</b> <b>coaches</b> from New Flyer and Electric Transit, Inc. (ETI) (Skoda/AAI), {{as well as}} standard 40 ft coaches from ETI. Historically, Muni ran ETBs from Brill, the St. Louis Car Company, Twin Coach, Marmon-Herrington and Flyer.|$|R
50|$|In October 2011, Megabus {{started an}} {{overnight}} sleeper service with 24 seats and bunks, between London and Glasgow. In November 2011 it started running daily and {{has proved to}} be very popular. The coaches used are modified Volvo B10M <b>articulated</b> <b>coaches</b> with Jonckheere bodywork.|$|R
50|$|Newer 'high-frills' <b>articulated</b> <b>coaches,</b> {{with both}} toilets and {{reclining}} seats, {{were used for}} the longer journeys between London and Scotland, but these were replaced early in 2005. These coaches have since been refurbished and modified to include beds for an Overnight 'Sleeper' service between London and Glasgow started in late 2011, competing with the Caledonian Sleeper train.|$|R
5000|$|The prototype, {{completed}} in 1937, differed {{in many respects}} from the production model. It was constructed from plywood instead of steel, used stressed skin construction, and lacked [...] "most of the usual auxiliary equipment of passenger cars." [...] This contributed to the comparatively low weight of 65000 lb. The two-unit <b>articulated</b> <b>coach</b> measured 145 ft long.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{formation}} of the new trains will have two power cars and nine passenger trailers. The trains will feature <b>articulated</b> <b>coaches,</b> and an additional three vehicles can be added if demand grows. The power cars, one at each end, include an Alstom Crash Energy Management system to help meet FRA standards while allowing a 30% reduction in train weight.|$|R
5|$|New Dennis Javelin {{coaches were}} {{introduced}} to route X43 by Stagecoach {{in response to the}} competition from Charterplan in 1992. The route was marketed as The Mancunian, with the vehicles carrying the name alongside Stagecoach corporate livery.

50|$|A {{little known}} loco which {{ran on the}} line was No. 14, a small 0-4-0 petrol engined shunter with Mechanical transmission. It was built for the line by Gordon Walker in 1985 using a 1000cc Austin engine and a Hudson coach bogie. No 14 was {{designed}} for permanent way work though it could in fact haul 6 of the line's <b>articulated</b> <b>coaches.</b> It was not successful, {{mainly because of the}} crude belt drive. It was moved in 1990, being acquired by Austin Moss of the Windmill Farm Railway.|$|R

50|$|The initial {{order was}} for 86 of the 40-foot coaches (model XT40) and 55 of the 60-foot, <b>articulated</b> <b>coaches</b> (model XT60). The order would have {{decreased}} {{the total number}} of trolleybuses in the fleet by 18 coaches since at the time the order was placed, Metro was planning to cut service (as a part of the cost-saving measures amid the economic downturn). Instead, the agency ended up expanding service after Seattle voters approved a transportation benefit district. As a result, the order was increased to 110 model XT40 buses and 64 model XT60 buses in early 2015.|$|R

5000|$|The Coot, that {{featured}} an <b>articulated</b> <b>twin</b> hull, kept {{all of its}} four wheels {{on the ground as}} much as possible, even when driving on very rough terrain. In production from 1967 - 1985.|$|R
50|$|The N2s were {{designed}} for suburban passenger operations, and worked most of the duties out of King's Cross and Moorgate, often hauling one or two quad-art sets of <b>articulated</b> suburban <b>coaches.</b> These ran to places such as New Barnet and Gordon Hill on the Hertford loop. They also hauled some empty coaching stock trains between King's Cross and Ferme Park carriage sidings.|$|R
5000|$|A car {{was shown}} at the British Empire Exhibition in 1924 and 1925 and tested by the LNER. To provide a better service to compete with raising levels of road traffic two of these {{articulated}} [...] two-cylinder chain-driven units were purchased, and operated in the Lowestoft area. This was followed by 22 cars to a similar design in 1927 and 1928. A prototype cardan shaft driven car with a rigid body was built in 1927 and between 1928 and 1930 forty-nine cars with six cylinder cardan shafts drives and rigid bodies were purchased, followed by five [...] cars in 1930 and 1932 and Phenomena, a <b>twin</b> <b>articulated</b> pair with two 100 hp six cylinder motors, in 1930.

50|$|In 1937 the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) updated and {{expanded}} the original North Eastern Railway {{of the electric}} suburban Tyneside system. The original NER electric units built in 1904-15 were replaced with 64 new <b>articulated</b> <b>twins,</b> 112 ft long, and two luggage vans. Two new parcel vans were built in 1938.|$|R
50|$|There {{are various}} types of trains that are {{designed}} for particular purposes. A train can consist {{of a combination of}} one or more locomotives and attached railroad cars, or a self-propelled multiple unit (or occasionally a single or <b>articulated</b> powered <b>coach,</b> called a railcar). Trains can also be hauled by horses, pulled by a cable, or run downhill by gravity.Special kinds of trains running on corresponding special 'railways' are atmospheric railways, monorails, high-speed railways, maglev, rubber-tired underground, funicular and cog railways.|$|R
5000|$|Initially, {{service was}} {{operated}} by five specially built two <b>coach</b> <b>articulated</b> railcars of class Bem550. These were built by Vevey Technologies (formerly Ateliers de Constructions Mécaniques de Vevey (ACMV)) with electrical equipment by Asea Brown Boveri in 1994. They ran under 1.5kV DC wires, but were {{equipped with a}} diesel engine {{to enable them to}} reach the workshops.|$|R
40|$|Legislatures {{across the}} United States have passed laws to combat {{strategic}} lawsuits against public participation (“SLAPPs”) —suits brought solely to harass {{a party that}} has exercised protected speech or petitioning activity. Federal courts exercising diversity jurisdiction have struggled to determine whether these nominally procedural laws—particularly their hallmark special motions to dismiss—apply outside of state courts. A proper reading of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure reveals that these laws may operate harmoniously alongside the federal system, and the <b>twin</b> aims <b>articulated</b> in the U. S. Supreme Court’s decision in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins favor application of anti-SLAPP laws in federal fora. Furthermore, even if the laws and the Rules directly conflict, it would violate the Rules Enabling Act to apply the Federal Rule in preemption of the state anti-SLAPP statute...|$|R
2500|$|The four-story {{building}} {{includes four}} fueling and defueling stations, cleaning and storage facilities for 200 buses {{on the first}} floor, an advanced 27 bus central maintenance facility on the second floor, administrative offices for NYCT's Department of Buses on the third floor, and parking garages for MTA employees on the roof. The central maintenance facility is able to repair and maintain the newer fleet of diesel, diesel hybrid-electric, [...] <b>articulated,</b> express <b>coach</b> and compressed natural gas (CNG) buses, and has expanded {{the capabilities of the}} current East New York central maintenance facility for Brooklyn and Queens. The facility also has four environmentally friendly paint booths − self-contained units that avoid the spread of contaminants.|$|R
50|$|There {{are various}} types of trains that are {{designed}} for particular purposes. A train may consist {{of a combination of}} one or more locomotives and attached railroad cars, or a self-propelled multiple unit (or occasionally a single or <b>articulated</b> powered <b>coach,</b> called a railcar). The first trains were rope-hauled, gravity powered or pulled by horses. From the early 19th century almost all were powered by steam locomotives. From the 1910s onwards the steam locomotives began to be replaced by less labor-intensive and cleaner (but more complex and expensive) diesel locomotives and electric locomotives, while {{at about the same time}} self-propelled multiple unit vehicles of either power system became much more common in passenger service.|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the <b>articulated</b> passenger <b>coaches</b> between traction heads configuration of the KTX-I, HSR-350x and KTX-II trains, the 6-car HEMU-400X is fitted with distributed traction: traction equipment is underfloor and all axles of all four intermediate cars are powered. [...] The detailed plans released in October 2010 changed the trailing end driving trailer of the experimental train into a powered car, deviating from the planned commercial version. [...] The new high-power configuration is to provide for higher acceleration: the 8-car commercial configuration was calculated to reach 300 km/h {{in less than four}} minutes and less than 12 km; the top test speed of 400 km/h is to be reached in 673 seconds and 56.98 km. [...] Similarly to JR East's Fastech 360 programme, the plan is to develop and test both asynchronous induction motors and permanent magnet synchronous motors in the train.|$|R
50|$|The owners {{struggled}} on {{with the}} 1972 coaches {{until the end of}} the 1986 season, by which time only five were serviceable. Despite continuing losses and poor prospects the Council felt it had no option but to replace the lot, accepting a tender submitted by Alan Keefe Ltd for a rake of five <b>articulated,</b> air-braked toastrack <b>coaches</b> with slatted seats. Each had four bays each capable of seating four adults, giving trains a theoretical capacity of eighty. They were delivered in February 1987 and air-braking was fitted to the locomotives.|$|R
