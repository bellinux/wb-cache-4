Brain's father, Aubrey (12 July 189321 September 1955), was a teacher and held the principal horn position in the BBC Symphony Orchestra, producing the first Mozart horn concerto recording in 1927. Brain's mother, Marion Brain, was also a composer and wrote cadenzas to the first and third Mozart horn concerti which her husband then performed. The family tradition also extended to his brother, Leonard Brain, (1915–1975), an oboist who performed with Dennis in a wind quintet that Dennis formed. Tina Brain, one of Leonard's children (Dennis' niece), also became a professional horn player.|$|E

Ikenga mustered the last gram of strength in a titanic muscle flex as he twisted {{the neck of the}} beast which broke with such nerve shattering crack. There were few groans and whimperings followed by death thrubs and ghostly silence pervaded the vast jungle.

50|$|The ACA Allertor 125 had {{a unique}} design, using the bottom horn {{as the air}} intake, and the top one as where the noise mainly came out. The air would first be sucked into the bottom horn, then into the donut-shaped metal sphere, where the chopper was located. The chopper would then make the sound and blow it out through the <b>top</b> <b>horn.</b> The siren could be heard from several miles away on a clear day. Unfortunately, the siren's size {{could prove to be}} quite difficult, as strong winds could blow it down. Also, the {{chain-driven}} rotators sometimes broke, usually leading to their failure, removal or downright replacement.|$|E
50|$|Teisco also {{produced}} a six-string bass called TB-64 (or ET-320) in 1964, {{similar to the}} Fender Bass VI which was itself an uncommon instrument. Teisco six-string bass followed an unusual body shape that was used {{on one of their}} guitars. It had an off-set body shape similar to a Jazzmaster, but with an extended <b>top</b> <b>horn,</b> a 'monkey handle' cutout on the left-facing side of the bridge and a Fender-style headstock with an oversized scroll. This instrument, as well as its regular-scale guitar equivalent, can be heard extensively on Blonde Redhead's early albums of the 90's, where they used its wide range to switch between bass and guitar melodies in the course of single songs.|$|E

Soon after Bolden was off the music scene, Keppard was proclaimed [...] "King Keppard" [...] as the city's <b>top</b> <b>horn</b> player (see: jazz royalty). This was mostly because he kept Buddy's style, which was popular but had not been recorded. Indeed, many contemporaries have testified that Keppard's playing style was the closest to Bolden's {{that can be found}} in the history of jazz recordings and can be considered a more musical and sophisticated extension of Bolden's style: rugged and forceful, clipped and more staccato, and rhythmically closer to ragtime than later New Orleans jazz.|$|E

50|$|In a {{drum and}} bugle corps, the marching style for {{contrabass}} bugles {{are the same}} as {{for the rest of the}} hornline. However, there can be small differences, especially with effects such as ripples of the hornline.

60|$|Bleeding and Cupping'.--Physicians say, now-a-days that {{bleeding}} is rarely, if ever, required; {{and that}} frequently it does much harm; but {{they used to}} bleed for everything.

50|$|The horn may be gripped {{with either}} the left hand or the right hand, and the valves may also be {{operated}} by either hand, which is facilitated {{by the presence of}} two pinky rings on the <b>top</b> of the <b>horn.</b> Similarly, the slide may be operated by either hand, giving the player the option to finger the valves with the right hand and operate the slide with the left, or vice versa.|$|R

50|$|The AN/FPS-16 is a C-band {{monopulse}} radar {{utilizing a}} waveguide hybrid-labyrinth comparator to develop angle track information. The comparator receives RF signals from {{an array of}} four feed horns which are located at {{the focal point of}} a 12 ft parabolic reflector. The comparator performs vector addition and subtraction of the energyreceived by each horn. The elevation tracking data is generated in the comparator as the difference between the sums of the <b>top</b> two <b>horns.</b> The azimuth tracking error is the difference between the sums of the two vertical horn pairs. The vectorial sums of all four horns is combined in a third channel. Three mixers with a common local oscillator, and three 30 MHz IF strips are used; one each for the azimuth, elevation, and sum signals.|$|R

40|$|Most logic {{programming}} languages have the first-order, classical theory of Horn clauses as their logical foundation. Purely proof-theoretical considerations show that Horn clauses are not {{rich enough to}} naturally provide the abstraction mechanisms that are common in most modern, general purpose programming languages. For example, Horn clauses do not incorporate the important software abstraction mechanisms of modules, data type abstractions, and higher-order programming. As {{a result of this}} lack, implementers of {{logic programming}} languages based on Horn clauses generally add several nonlogical primitives on <b>top</b> of <b>Horn</b> clauses to provide these missing abstraction mechanisms. Although the missing features are often captured in this fashion, formal semantics of the resulting languages are often lacking or are very complex. Another approach to providing these missing features is to enrich the underlying logical foundation of logic programming. This latter approach to providing logic programs with these missing abstraction mechanisms is taken in this paper. The enrichments we will consider have simple and direct operational and proof theoretical semantics...|$|R
