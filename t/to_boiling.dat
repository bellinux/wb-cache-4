5|$|Cooking in {{southern}} England was noted for {{a tendency toward}} frying, simmering, and roasting, and this also became true for Virginian cooking. Wealthy households tended to vary cooking methods greatly, while poor households were generally confined <b>to</b> <b>boiling</b> and frying. The only form of cooking that was slow to develop was baking. Typical dishes among the upper classes were fricassees of various meats with herbs, and sometimes {{a good amount of}} claret. Common food among the lower classes was corn porridge or mush, hominy with greens and salt-cured meat, and later the traditional southern fried chicken and chitlins.|$|E
5|$|In Dewey County, SH-34 crosses SH-47, {{two miles}} (3km) south of Leedey, and crosses the Canadian River near the unincorporated {{settlement}} of Trail. The highway then passes through Camargo. Just east of Vici, SH-34 joins US-60 and SH-51 for a one-mile (1.6km) concurrency, then SH-34 heads north again at Vici. The highway passes through Sharon north of Vici, then joins US-183/US-270/SH-3 four miles (6km) southeast of Woodward. At Woodward, SH-34 again sets {{off to the}} north alone, and right after crossing the North Canadian River, SH-34C branches to the east about two miles (3km) north of Woodward, connecting <b>to</b> <b>Boiling</b> Springs State Park.|$|E

5|$|The {{road that}} is {{currently}} SH-34C first appeared on the 1948 state highway map as SH-15A. At this time, the highway began at US-183/US-270/SH-15/SH-34 in Woodward and headed north, then turned east {{north of the city}} and headed <b>to</b> <b>Boiling</b> Springs State Park. When SH-34 was realigned north of Woodward on November 1, 1954, it took over the portion of SH-15A in Woodward, severing the highway's link to its parent. SH-15A had been renumbered as SH-34C by 1956. By 1957, the highway was extended east, passing through the park and continuing onward to SH-50. However, by 1959, the road through the park had been removed from the state highway system; the segment of highway east of the park was renumbered to SH-50B.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the pottery}} found in 9th century pueblos was sized for {{individuals}} or small families, but as communal ceremonialism expanded during the 13th century, many larger, feast–sized vessels were produced. Corrugated decorations appear on Mesa Verde grey wares after 700, and by 1000 entire vessels were crafted in this way. The technique created a rough exterior surface that {{was easier to}} hold on to than regular grey wares, which were smooth. By the 11th century these corrugated vessels, which dissipated heat more efficiently than smoother ones, had largely replaced the older style, whose tendency to retain heat made them prone <b>to</b> <b>boiling</b> over. Corrugation likely developed as ancient potters attempted to mimic the visual properties of coiled basketry. Corrugated wares were made using clay from formations other than Menefee, which suggests that ancient potters selected different clays for different styles. Potters also selected clays and altered firing conditions to achieve specific colors. Under normal conditions, pots made of Mancos shale turned grey when fired, and those made of Morrison Formation clay turned white. Clays from southeastern Utah turned red when fired in a high-oxygen environment.|$|E

25|$|SH-50 {{underwent}} a major realignment on October 6, 1958, bypassing a gravel section with a straighter paved route. At the same time, SH-50A {{was established to}} connect the new road to Alabaster Caverns. Around this time, SH-34C, formerly a continuous highway linking SH-34 <b>to</b> <b>Boiling</b> Springs State Park and onward to SH-50, was split into two highways, with the middle section through the park being decommissioned. The section of highway east of the park was renumbered to SH-50B.|$|E
25|$|Antimony (Sb) is a {{metalloid}} {{element that}} {{is used as a}} catalyst in the form of compounds such as antimony trioxide (Sb2O3) or antimony triacetate in the production of PET.

Antimony also remains in the material itself and can, thus, migrate out into food and drinks. Exposing PET <b>to</b> <b>boiling</b> or microwaving can increase the levels of antimony significantly, possibly above USEPA maximum contamination levels.|$|E

25|$|The {{order of}} steps in {{preparing}} {{a cup of}} tea is a much-debated topic, and can vary widely between cultures or even individuals. Some say it is preferable to add the milk before the tea, as the high temperature of freshly brewed tea can denature the proteins found in fresh milk, similar to the change in taste of UHT milk, resulting in an inferior-tasting beverage. Others insist it is better to add the milk after brewing the tea, as black tea is often brewed as close <b>to</b> <b>boiling</b> as possible. The addition of milk chills the beverage during the crucial brewing phase, if brewing in a cup rather than using a pot, meaning the delicate flavour of a good tea cannot be fully appreciated. By adding the milk afterwards, it is easier to dissolve sugar in the tea and also to ensure the desired amount of milk is added, as the colour of the tea can be observed. Historically, the order of steps was taken as an indication of class: only those wealthy enough to afford good-quality porcelain would be confident of its being able to cope with being exposed <b>to</b> <b>boiling</b> water unadulterated with milk. Higher temperature difference means faster heat transfer so the earlier you add milk the slower the drink cools. A 2007 study published in the European Heart Journal found certain beneficial effects of tea may be lost through the addition of milk.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{reaching}} Mooreland, SH-50 splits {{off to the}} north. On {{the northern}} outskirts of town, SH-50 intersects one of its spur routes, SH-50B, which connects Mooreland <b>to</b> <b>Boiling</b> Springs State Park. SH-50 briefly turns east, continuing the alignment of SH-50B, before turning back north again. SH-50 follows a due north heading in this area, paralleling Long Creek and crossing many of the intermittent streams that feed it. The road then turns northeast toward Alabaster Caverns State Park. As the highway approaches the park, it spawns a spur leading into the park, SH-50A, before continuing northeast, clipping {{the northwest corner of}} the park boundary. The road then gradually eases into a more northerly heading as it approaches the Cimarron River.|$|E
25|$|The Mark I {{containment}} {{was used}} in those reactors at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant which {{were involved in the}} Fukushima I nuclear accidents. The site suffered from a combination of two beyond design-basis events, a powerful earthquake which may have damaged reactor plumbing and structures and 15 meter tsunami which destroyed fuel tanks, generators and wiring causing back up generators to fail, and battery-powered pumps also eventually failed. Insufficient cooling and failure of pumps needed to restore water lost <b>to</b> <b>boiling</b> off led to partial or possible complete meltdowns of fuel rods which were completely uncovered by water. This led to releases of significant amounts of radioactive material to the air and sea, and hydrogen explosions. However PWR reactors also require years of powered pumped cooling water. The thin secondary containments were not designed to withstand hydrogen explosions, and suffered blown out or destroyed roofs and walls, and destruction of all equipment on the refueling floor including cranes and refueling platform. Unit 3 suffered a particularly spectacular explosion which created a plume of debris over 300m high which resulted in a collapse of {{the north end of the}} top floor, and buckled concrete columns on its west side as can be seen by aerial photographs. Although they were fitted with modified hardened vent systems to vent hydrogen into exhaust stacks, they may have not been effective without power. Unit 2 had a large panel removed to vent gases, but suffered an explosion to the lower suppression area. Even before the Fukushima incident, Mark I containment had been criticized as being more likely to fail during a blackout.|$|E

500|$|Small steam devils {{occur at}} some of the larger hot springs in Yellowstone Park where a layer of steam fog hangs over the pools and wind can start to lift it up into fog streamers.

[...] In 1982 a cluster of seventeen steam devils was observed when the air temperature was between 17 and 21°C. [...] Although this is much higher than, for instance, the temperature of the air over the Great Lakes, the water temperature is also proportionately higher, being very close <b>to</b> <b>boiling,</b> so the temperature difference is still 79°C.|$|E
