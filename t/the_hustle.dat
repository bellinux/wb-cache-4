5|$|As the day {{of their}} May 9, 1840, wedding approached, some family members still looked upon Houston with {{uncertainty}} and were determined to stop what they believed would be a disastrous union for Margaret. She would not be deterred, however, and the Reverend Peter Crawford officiated over the wedding of Margaret and the man {{with whom she had}} fallen in love. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon week at the Lafayette Hotel before sailing to Galveston, where Nancy and the Bledsoes had already established residences. Houston retained a house he owned in the city named for him, but Margaret had no taste for <b>the</b> <b>hustle</b> and bustle and preferred the lesser-populated Galveston. She and her personal slaves, who had accompanied the newlyweds from Alabama, shared her mother's house while Houston traveled.|$|E

25|$|At {{the centre}} of all Nambassa festivals lay the village marketplaces. These {{consisted}} of dozens of hand craft outlets and health food eateries.

These centers of community are where one found the main information centre or where folks simply culminated just to absorb the diverse quirky celebratory ambiance. Over the various festivals the marketplaces evolved and became major attractions in themselves. Not only a space for the enjoyment of bartering for the various eclective products and oddities, but they were a place of fun and entertainment, spontaneous or otherwise. The idea of a marketplace servicing the local population, {{as a method of}} doing business, buying, selling and exchanging products, is as old as civilization itself.|$|E
25|$|Disco is {{a musical}} style {{originating}} in the early 1970s that remained urban and largely underground {{until the middle of}} the decade when it began to emerge from America's urban nightlife scene, where it had been curtailed to house parties and makeshift discotheques, and began making regular appearances mainstream, gaining popularity and increasing airplay on radio. It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia, San Francisco, and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco {{can be seen as a}} reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. Disco was popular with both men and women from many different backgrounds, with dances including the Bump and <b>the</b> <b>Hustle.</b>|$|E
