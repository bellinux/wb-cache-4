5|$|All {{observation}} involves both {{perception and}} cognition. That is, {{one does not}} make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding {{of the way in}} which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In <b>this</b> <b>sense,</b> it can be argued that all observation is theory-laden.|$|E
5|$|Dante's {{rewriting}} of the Lucanian scene 'recuperates' {{the witch}} Erichtho by making her {{necessary to the}} Dantean Virgil's status as guide: she thus functions {{in accord with the}} Christian providence that controls the advancement of the Commedias plot line. At the same time, the Lucanian Erichtho is both marginalized and subordinated to a higher power. In <b>this</b> <b>sense,</b> Dante's rewriting of Erichtho also undoes Lucan's subversion of the original Virgilian model.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an extensible highly compact fiber-optic system for multi-segment flex <b>sensing.</b> <b>This</b> fiber-optic arrangement is 7. 5 mm {{in diameter and}} is comprised of a flexible and stretchable Steiner chain (n= 12) housing at the top which accommodates passive cables used for sensing, followed by a basal rigid fiber-optic sensing unit. The U-shape loopback design of the sensing system allows integration of electronics {{on one side and}} away from the sensing region. A low-friction retractable distance modulation array is designed and implemented to reduce the hysteresis and recover reference sensor values when the arm returns to its original straight configuration. <b>This</b> <b>sensing</b> system is able to measure the dynamic flex patterns of the actuation system to which it conforms. <b>This</b> <b>sensing</b> system can also be embedded inside soft robotic manipulators for multi-segment flex sensing independent of actuation systems, temperature or external load from the environment. This arrangement can also be used as a complete manipulation system when actuating tendons are attached...|$|R

5|$|In {{more general}} usage, noise is any {{unwanted}} sound or signal. In <b>this</b> <b>sense,</b> even sounds {{that would be}} perceived as musically ordinary in another context become noise if they interfere with the reception of a message desired by the receiver. Prevention and reduction of unwanted sound, from tape hiss to squeaking bass drum pedals, is important in many musical pursuits, but noise is also used creatively in many ways, and in some way in nearly all genres.|$|E
5|$|In the prologue, John {{identifies}} Jesus as the Logos (Word). In Ancient Greek philosophy, {{the term}} logos meant {{the principle of}} cosmic reason. In <b>this</b> <b>sense,</b> it {{was similar to the}} Hebrew concept of Wisdom, God's companion and intimate helper in creation. The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo merged these two themes when he described the Logos as God's creator of and mediator with the material world. The evangelist adapted Philo's description of the Logos, applying it to Jesus, the incarnation of the Logos.|$|E
5|$|Instead, he practised a {{different}} style of science: systematically gathering data, discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals, and inferring possible causal explanations from these. This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field, such as genomics. It does not result in the same certainty as experimental science, but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed. In <b>this</b> <b>sense,</b> Aristotle's biology is scientific.|$|E

40|$|A new {{and simple}} {{fluorescent}} chemosensor 1, based on julolidine and tryptophan moieties, has been synthesized and characterized. The sensor 1 displayed a selective and sensitive detecting ability for aluminum (III) ion by 'OFF-ON' fluorescent response in aqueous solution. <b>This</b> <b>sensing</b> mechanism {{might be due}} to the inhibition of CN isomerization, and the activation of chelation enhanced fluorescence (CHEF). <b>This</b> <b>sensing</b> mechanism of 1 for Al 3 + was supported by theoretical calculations. Moreover, sensor 1 had a low detection limit (6. 4 μM), which is below than the WHO recommendation level (7. 41 μM) for drinking water. Importantly, the chemosensor 1 could be applied to living cells to detect Al 3 +. Therefore, the sensor 1 can be employed as a practical fluorescent chemosensor for recognition of Al 3 + in aqueous solution. clos...|$|R

5|$|Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl drew on his {{imprisonment}} at Auschwitz in composing Man's Search for Meaning (1946), one of {{the most}} widely read works about the camp. An existentialist work, the book argues that individuals can find purpose even among great suffering, and that <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> of purpose sustains them. Wiesel wrote about his own imprisonment at Auschwitz in Night (1960) and other works, and became a prominent spokesman against ethnic violence. In 1986, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.|$|E

5|$|The {{internal}} {{structure of the}} ear, which has large numbers of auditory neurons, gives an improved ability to detect low-frequency sounds at a distance, which could include rustling made by prey moving in vegetation. The tawny owl's hearing is ten times better than a human's, and it can hunt using <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> {{alone in the dark}} of a woodland on an overcast night, but the patter of raindrops makes it difficult to detect faint sounds, and prolonged wet weather can lead to starvation if the owl cannot hunt effectively.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>sense</b> {{of unity}} was {{represented}} in new media. Dutch-language magazines for educated native youth, {{such as the}} Jong Java (1915) and Jong Sumatranen Bond (1917), advocated a modern national identity without the traditional feudal system. Nationalist views were advocated through magazines for adults, including Pandji Poestaka (first published 1930) and Timboel (first published 1932); these were short-lived publications and only included literature as a supplement. There were also unsuccessful attempts to found Malay-language literary publications, such as Malaya (announced in 1921).|$|E

5|$|While Hawks was not {{sympathetic}} to feminism, he popularized the Hawksian woman archetype, a portrayal {{of women in}} more strong, less effeminate roles. Such an emphasis had never {{been done in the}} 1920s and therefore was seen to be a rarity and, according to Naomi Wise, has been cited as a prototype of the post-feminist movement. Another notable theme carried throughout his work included the relationship of morality and human interaction. In <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> he tended to portray more dramatic elements of a concept or a plot in a humorous way.|$|E
5|$|A salient {{feature of}} Buddhist {{philosophy}} which sets it apart from Indian orthodoxy is {{the centrality of}} the doctrine of not-self (Pāli. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self. In <b>this</b> <b>sense,</b> what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that does not apply to anything real but to an erroneous {{way of looking at the}} ever changing stream of five interconnected aggregate factors. The relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising (pratītyasamutpāda). This means that all things, including mental events, arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions. This seems to reject both causal determinist and epiphenomenalist conceptions of mind.|$|E
5|$|Additional traits {{shared with}} other {{prosimian}} primates (strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation. Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less {{independent of the}} other fingers, their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted hallux (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs. A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, a trait found only in New World monkeys, particularly atelids, among primates. Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense of smell, a trait shared with most other mammals and early primates, {{but not with the}} visually oriented higher primates. <b>This</b> <b>sense</b> of smell is important in terms of marking territory as well as provide an indication of whether or not another lemur is a viable breeding partner.|$|E

5|$|Americium readily {{reacts with}} oxygen and dissolves well in acids. The most common {{oxidation}} state for americium is +3, in which americium compounds are rather stable against oxidation and reduction. In <b>this</b> <b>sense,</b> americium is chemically similar to most lanthanides. The trivalent americium forms insoluble fluoride, oxalate, iodate, hydroxide, phosphate and other salts. Other oxidation {{states have been}} observed between +2 and +7, which is the widest range among the actinide elements. Their color in aqueous solutions varies as follows: Am3+ (colorless to yellow-reddish), Am4+ (yellow-reddish), AmV; (yellow), AmVI (brown) and AmVII (dark green). All oxidation states have their characteristic optical absorption spectra, with a few sharp peaks in the visible and mid-infrared regions, and the position and intensity of these peaks can be converted into the concentrations of the corresponding oxidation states. For example, Am(III) has two sharp peaks at 504 and 811nm, Am(V) at 514 and 715nm, and Am(VI) at 666 and 992nm.|$|E
5|$|As a manifesto, this {{paragraph}} became {{significant for the}} amalgamation of symphonic and dramatic elements in the same musical composition. Musicologist Hugh MacDonald writes that as Berlioz kept the idea of symphonic construction closely in mind, he allowed the orchestra to express {{the majority of the}} drama in instrumental music and set expository and narrative sections in words. Fellow musicologist Nicholas Temperley suggests that, in Roméo, Berlioz created a model for how a dramatic text could guide the structure of a choral symphony without circumventing that work from being recognizably a symphony. In <b>this</b> <b>sense,</b> musicologist Mark Evans Bonds writes, the symphonies of Liszt and Mahler owe a debt of influence to Berlioz.|$|E
5|$|Boisbaudran {{named his}} element samaria after the mineral samarskite, {{which in turn}} honored Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets (1803–1870).

In <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> samarium was the first chemical element to be named after a person. Later the name samaria used by Boisbaudran was transformed into samarium, to conform with other element names, and samaria nowadays is sometimes {{used to refer to}} samarium oxide, by analogy with yttria, zirconia, alumina, ceria, holmia, etc. The symbol Sm was suggested for samarium; however an alternative Sa was frequently used instead until the 1920s.|$|E
