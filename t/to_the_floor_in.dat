5|$|Picard confronts Q, {{who tells}} him that {{although}} the bout with the Nausicaan nearly cost him his life, it also gave him a sense of his mortality. It taught him that life was too precious to squander by playing it safe. Picard realizes that his attempts to suppress and ignore {{the consequences of his}} indiscretions have resulted in him losing a part of himself. Picard then declares that he would rather die as captain of the Enterprise than live as a nobody. Q sends him back to the bar fight and events unfold as they did originally, with Picard being stabbed through the heart and laughing as he collapses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>In</b> the present, Picard awakens in sickbay, a Captain again. As Picard recovers from his injury, he wonders if his journey into the past was one of Q's tricks or merely a dream. Nevertheless, he is grateful for the insight the experience gave him.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} {{improving}} navigation along the Kentucky River was raised numerous times by Representative James Blue during the 1876 legislative session. Despite Blue's promises of manifold {{benefits to the}} state from such an investment, parsimonious legislators defeated a bill allocating funds for the improvements. The issue gained traction with some voters during the biennial legislative elections, however, which brought it back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> the 1878 session. Prompted by recommendations from the Kentucky River Navigation Convention in 1877, McCreary abandoned his typical fiscal conservatism and joined the calls for improvements along the river. In response, legislators passed a largely ineffective bill providing that, if funds could be raised through special taxes in districts along the river, the state would provide the funds to maintain the improvements.|$|E
5|$|Trinidad was {{subsequently}} scheduled {{to fight against}} Hacine Cherifi in a contest that he won by technical knockout in the fourth round. The event {{was part of a}} card that took place on May 11, 2002, and was organized in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Early in the first round Trinidad's strategy consisted of using his jab while Cherifi did not try to directly engage in the offensive. In the last minute of the round a punch by Trinidad hit Cherifi's chin leaving him disoriented, he followed this with a combination and scored a knockdown. In the second round, Trinidad displayed more boxing and was on the offensive by using combinations to the head and ribs. In the third Cherifi landed more punches than in the previous two, but Trinidad relied on throwing left jabs. One of his punches hit Cherifi's liver, followed by a punch to the jaw, making Cherifi fall <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>In</b> the fourth, a series of combinations injured Cherifi, who collapsed to the floor twice, forfeiting the fight on the second occasion. Following this contest Trinidad announced his retirement, at the moment leaving the sport with a record of 41wins, one defeat, and 34wins by knockout.|$|E

25|$|American house spiders usually feed {{on small}} insects and {{household}} pests such as flies, mosquitoes, ants and wasps. They can randomly attack grasshoppers, butterflies, cockroaches or other spiders {{depending on their}} size. If the prey is too agile, the spider will try shooting web {{at it from a}} distance before pulling the thread toward itself. Bigger females can also attract baby skinks inside their web by leaving fly remains hanging in it. Once its food dries out, the spider usually drops it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> order to free space in its web, instead of destroying and rebuilding it or changing its location.|$|E

25|$|Skirts {{were held}} in the proper shape by a farthingale or hoop skirt. In Spain, the {{cone-shaped}} Spanish farthingale remained in fashion into the early 17th century. It was only briefly fashionable in France, where a padded roll or French farthingale (called in England a bum roll) held the skirts out in a rounded shape at the waist, falling in soft folds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>In</b> England, the Spanish farthingale was worn through the 1570s, and was gradually replaced by the French farthingale. By the 1590s, skirts were pinned to wide wheel farthingales to achieve a drum shape.|$|E

25|$|The mantua or manteau {{was a new}} {{fashion that}} arose in the 1680s. Instead of a bodice and skirt cut separately, the mantua hung from the {{shoulders}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> (<b>in</b> the manner of dresses of earlier periods) started off as the female version of the men's Banyan, worn for 'undress' wear. Gradually it developed into a draped and pleated dress and eventually evolved into a dress worn looped and draped up over a contrasting petticoat and a stomacher. The mantua-and-stomacher resulted in a high, square neckline {{in contrast to the}} broad, off-the-shoulder neckline previously in fashion. The new look was both more modest and covered-up than previous fashions and decidedly fussy, with bows, frills, ribbons, and other trim, but the short string of pearls and pearl earrings or eardrops worn since the 1630s remained popular.|$|E

25|$|Wait staff trays are {{typically}} large circular disks used to serve drinks and/or food {{to people in}} restaurants, bars, and other hospitality industry businesses. The waiter or waitress carries the tray with the open palm of one hand placed underneath, in about {{the center of the}} tray, relying on dry friction between the hand and the smooth metal or plastic undersurface of the tray to retain control of the tray. Occasionally, the tray may slide from the waitperson's hand, and the contents crash <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>In</b> a May 2012 survey of food industry servers, those responding revealed nearly 25 percent of staff that work or have worked in the hospitality industry have suffered an injury {{as a result of a}} toppled serving tray. Of those people questioned, 23 percent had burned or cut themselves while trying to serve drinks or food from a serving tray.|$|E
25|$|The fifth {{match was}} a Texas Tornado match between Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) and The Varsity Club (Mike Rotunda and Kevin Sullivan). In this match, all the {{competitors}} were legal {{and there was}} no need to be tagged in. Sullivan and Rick started against each other while Rotunda and Scott battled each other. Rotunda dominated Scott and threw him out of the ring, which allowed Rotunda and Sullivan to double-team Rick. Scott entered the ring and Rick delivered a Belly To Back Suplex to Sullivan. Sullivan tossed Rick on the floor outside the ring. The match continued as Sullivan and Rotunda dominated the match. Rick tried to deliver a Lariat, which he called Steinerline, to Sullivan but Sullivan tossed him out of the ring. Scott was double teamed by Varsity Club. Rotunda came off the ropes to attack Scott but he pulled the rope down causing Rotunda to fall <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>In</b> the ring, Sullivan tried to deliver a Shoulderbreaker to Rick but Scott delivered a Diving Crossbody on Sullivan. Both Steiner Brothers fell on Sullivan and pinned him to win the match.|$|E
25|$|Kelly {{asserted}} {{that he was}} not present, and that Fitzpatrick's wounds were self-inflicted. Kenneally, who interviewed the remaining Kelly brother, Jim Kelly, and Kelly cousin and gang providore Tom Lloyd, in addition to closely examining the 1881 report by the Royal Commission on the Police Force of Victoria, wrote that Fitzpatrick was drunk {{when he arrived at the}} Kellys, that while he was waiting for Dan, he made a pass at Kate, and Dan threw him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>In</b> the ensuing struggle, Fitzgerald drew his revolver, Ned appeared, and with his brother seized the constable, disarming him, but not before he struck his wrist against the projecting part of the door lock, an injury he claimed to be a gunshot wound. Upon what Kelly claimed was Fitzpatrick's false evidence, his mother, Skillian and Williamson were convicted. A reward of £100 was offered for Kelly's arrest. Kelly claimed that this injustice exasperated him, and led to his taking to the bush. Just before Kelly was taken away from Benalla after the Glenrowan shootout, Senior-Constable Kelly reported he interviewed Kelly in his cell and that he admitted to shooting Fitzpatrick.|$|E

500|$|The Admiralty {{division}} {{housed a}} few prisoners under naval courts-martial for mutiny, desertion, piracy, {{and what the}} deputy marshal in 1815 preferred to call [...] "unnatural crimes". Unlike {{other parts of the}} prison that had been built from scratch in 1811, the Admiralty division—as well as the northern boundary wall, the dayroom and the chapel—had been part of the old Borough gaol and were considerably run down. The cells were so rotten they were barely able to confine the prisoners; in 1817 one actually broke through his cell walls. The low boundary wall meant that Admiralty prisoners were often chained to bolts fixed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> the infirmary.|$|E
