5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Crab</b> Bowl Classic, {{also known}} as <b>the</b> <b>Crab</b> Bowl or the Maryland–Navy rivalry, is an American college {{football}} rivalry between the Maryland Terrapins football team of the University of Maryland and the Navy Midshipmen football team of the United States Naval Academy. The two institutions, located in close proximity {{in the state of}} Maryland, first met for a football game in 1905. Since then, the series has often been marked by controversy, with incidents by players and supporters occurring {{both on and off the}} field. The winner of the game is awarded <b>the</b> <b>Crab</b> Bowl Trophy.|$|E

5|$|In the Tosco-Emilian Apennines, P.fluviatile is {{only found}} {{south of the}} watershed, in {{contrast}} with the crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, which occurs on both sides on the mountains. Although their ranges overlap, the two species do not inhabit the same water courses, apparently because <b>the</b> <b>crab</b> outcompetes the crayfish, which is therefore forced to live in less favourable locations where <b>the</b> <b>crab</b> cannot survive. Non-indigenous crayfish may pose a greater threat to P.fluviatile than native crayfish, although the greatest threats remain pollution, overfishing and the draining of wetlands.|$|E
5|$|Canterbury was the {{terminus}} of the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway (known {{locally as}} <b>the</b> <b>Crab</b> and Winkle line) {{which was a}} pioneer line, opened on 3 May 1830, and closed in 1953. The Canterbury and Whitstable was the first regular passenger steam railway in the world. The first station in Canterbury was at North Lane.|$|E
5|$|In 1947 a Belgian film {{adaptation}} of <b>The</b> <b>Crab</b> with the Golden Claws was produced, and believing that cinematic adaptations {{were a good}} way to proceed, Hergé contacted Disney Studios in the United States; they declined his offer to adapt The Adventures of Tintin for the silver screen.|$|E
50|$|This inaugural {{year of the}} Far West League culminated {{with the}} top five League teams {{competing}} in a double-elimination Tournament, hosted by <b>the</b> Humboldt <b>Crabs</b> and played in the Arcata Ball Park, August 5-7. <b>The</b> Humboldt <b>Crabs</b> (21 - 6), with {{the best record in}} regular season league play, were the top-seeded team, but lost their first game to fourth-seed Fontanetti's Athletics, 1-0, on August 5. To avoid being eliminated, <b>the</b> <b>Crabs</b> had to win four games in a row. On August 6, <b>the</b> <b>Crabs</b> shut out <b>the</b> Atwater Aviators, 2-0, in an elimination game. On August 7 <b>the</b> <b>Crabs</b> won three games in one day, starting with Fontanetti's Athletics, 7-2, (who had beaten <b>the</b> <b>Crabs</b> 2 of 3 games in regular-season play); then facing the Neptune Beach Pearl who had won 8 of their previous 9 games, and who were as yet undefeated in the Tournament. By winning four in a row, including 6-3 and 5-1 wins over <b>the</b> Pearl, <b>the</b> <b>Crabs</b> avoided elimination and won the tournament and the championship.|$|R

50|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> pea <b>crab</b> and its host {{is one of}} parasitism, rather than commensalism, since the host may be harmed by <b>the</b> <b>crab's</b> feeding activities. <b>The</b> pea <b>crab</b> solely relies on its host for food, safety, and oxygen.|$|R
5|$|In 1957, the {{animation}} company Belvision Studios produced {{a string of}} colour adaptations based upon Hergé's original comics, adapting eight of the Adventures {{into a series of}} daily five-minute episodes. <b>The</b> <b>Crab</b> with the Golden Claws was the fifth such story to be adapted, being directed by Ray Goossens and written by Greg, himself a well-known cartoonist who in later years would become editor-in-chief of Tintin magazine.|$|E
5|$|The burrows made by N.californiensis {{have many}} branches, {{and a number}} of other animals live in them, {{including}} snapping shrimp of the genus Betaeus, the copepod Clausidium vancouverense, and <b>the</b> <b>crab</b> Scleroplax granulata. The gut flora of N.californiensis includes a wide range of bacteria, comprising around 40% Alphaproteobacteria, 20% gram-positive bacteria, 20% in the Cryptophaga–Flavobacteria–Bacteroides group, and 5% of each of Gammaproteobacteria and Epsilonproteobacteria. Predators of N.californiensis include bottom-dwelling fish and Dungeness crabs (Metacarcinus magister).|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} exist {{that are of}} interest to astronomers. Taurus hosts two of the nearest open clusters to Earth, the Pleiades and the Hyades, {{both of which are}} visible to the naked eye. At first magnitude, the red giant Aldebaran is the brightest star in the constellation. In the northwest part of Taurus is the supernova remnant Messier 1, more commonly known as <b>the</b> <b>Crab</b> Nebula. One of the closest regions of active star formation, the Taurus-Auriga complex, crosses into {{the northern part of the}} constellation. The variable star T Tauri is the prototype of a class of pre-main-sequence stars.|$|E
50|$|Gecarcoidea is genus of {{terrestrial}} <b>crabs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>crabs</b> live in forests but {{must come to}} the coast to breed. When it is dry in <b>the</b> summer <b>the</b> <b>crabs</b> are inactive, but when it is the wet season {{they are ready to}} migrate.|$|R

50|$|In {{northern}} Colombia, shavings of {{the stems}} of Dolichandra quadrivalvis {{are added to}} bait which is left overnight near <b>the</b> burrows of <b>crabs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>crabs</b> are paralyzed {{for a few hours}} after eating the bait and are picked up by crabbers in <b>the</b> morning. <b>The</b> <b>crabs</b> recover before they reach market, and no harm from eating them has been reported.|$|R
5|$|In 1938, Walter Baade {{became the}} first {{astronomer}} to identify a nebula as a supernova remnant when he suggested that <b>the</b> <b>Crab</b> Nebula was the remains of SN 1054. He noted that, while it had {{the appearance of a}} planetary nebula, the measured velocity of expansion was much too large to belong to that classification. During the same year, Baade first proposed the use of the Type Ia supernova as a secondary distance indicator. Later, the work of Allan Sandage and Gustav Tammann helped refine the process so that Type Ia supernovae became a type of standard candle for measuring large distances across the cosmos.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, Casterman {{suggested}} to Hergé that his books {{be published in}} a new format; 62-pages rather than the former 100 to 130 pages, and now in full colour rather than black-and-white. He agreed to this, and in 1943 <b>The</b> <b>Crab</b> with the Golden Claws was re-edited and coloured for publication as an album in 1944. Due to the changes in how the adventure had been serialised at , the album at this juncture was only 58 pages long, and thus Hergé filled the missing pages with four full-page colour frames, thus bringing {{it up to the}} standard 62-page format.|$|E
5|$|In May 1941, a paper {{shortage}} {{led to the}} Soir-Jeunesse being {{reduced to}} four pages, with {{the length of the}} Tintin strip being cut by two thirds. Several weeks later the supplement disappeared altogether, with <b>The</b> <b>Crab</b> with the Golden Claws being moved into Le Soir itself, where it became a daily strip. While some Belgians were upset that Hergé was willing to work for a newspaper controlled by the occupying Nazi administration, he was heavily enticed by the size of 's readership, which reached 600,000.|$|E
50|$|Because crab size {{is related}} to gall size, {{it is likely that}} <b>the</b> <b>crabs</b> form <b>the</b> galls, rather than living {{randomly}} in a dwelling within a coral. Related groups of gall crab taxa share a similar gall type, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>crabs</b> influence <b>the</b> morphology of the galls.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally, crabs are steamed in {{rock salt}} and Old Bay Seasoning, a favored local spice mixture {{manufactured}} in Baltimore for decades. Southern State cooks, Marylanders insist, boil crabs {{and along with}} it, boil away all the true flavor. [...] <b>The</b> <b>crabs</b> are eaten on tables spread with old newspaper or plain brown wrapping paper. The meat of <b>the</b> <b>crabs</b> is extracted {{with the use of}} wooden mallets, knives, and one's hands. It is popular for cold beer to be thrown on <b>the</b> <b>crabs</b> during <b>the</b> steaming process, and made available afterwards.|$|R
40|$|One {{hundred and}} fourty nine <b>crabs</b> of <b>the</b> species Callinectes rathbunae Contreras parasitized with the rhizocephalan Loxothylacus texanus Boschma were captured. The average shell width was 8. 48 cm. Three types of externa were {{registered}} in the hosts: virgin, immature and mature externa; their number varied from one to four, being more common <b>the</b> <b>crabs</b> with one externa. The behavior of parasitized crabs was registered during six months. <b>The</b> most aggressive <b>crabs</b> were those that presented virgin externa (n = 82), while the less aggressive ones were those who presented three to four mature externa (n = 3). <b>The</b> <b>crabs</b> with virgin and immature externa conserved the capacity of burying themselves, while the organisms with mature externa lost that capacity. The animals with mature externa passed {{most of the time}} grooming and oxygenating the externa they carried. <b>The</b> <b>crabs</b> with mature externa presented bigger voracity that <b>the</b> <b>crabs</b> with immature externa. It can be concluded that the level of aggressiveness of <b>the</b> parasitized <b>crabs</b> is related with the degree of development of the externa, the degree of aggressiveness of <b>the</b> parasitized <b>crabs</b> is not related with the sex and mature externa represent a great metabolic load for their hosts...|$|R
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{apparent}} immutability of the heavens, Chinese astronomers were aware that new stars could appear. In 185 AD, {{they were the first}} to observe and write about a supernova, now known as the SN 185. The brightest stellar event in recorded history was the SN 1006 supernova, which was observed in 1006 and written about by the Egyptian astronomer Ali ibn Ridwan and several Chinese astronomers. The SN 1054 supernova, which gave birth to <b>the</b> <b>Crab</b> Nebula, was also observed by Chinese and Islamic astronomers.|$|E
5|$|Legal Sea Foods, an East Coast of the United States {{restaurant}} chain has arranged to purchase green crabs in season from local fishermen, {{in the first}} known commercial use for the crabs in the US food industry. Legal plans to test crab and shrimp etouffee, crab risotto with spring vegetables, and crab minestrone, all made with green crab stock, in their test kitchen {{during the winter of}} 2015 and offer the dishes in their other restaurant locations during <b>the</b> <b>crab</b> season.|$|E
5|$|Supernova SN 1054 {{was another}} widely {{observed}} event, with Arab, Chinese, and Japanese astronomers recording the star's appearance in 1054 CE. It {{may also have}} been recorded by the Anasazi as a petroglyph. This explosion appeared in the constellation of Taurus, where it produced <b>the</b> <b>Crab</b> Nebula remnant. At its peak, the luminosity of SN 1054 may have been four times as bright as Venus, and it remained visible in daylight for 23 days and was visible in the night sky for 653 days.|$|E
40|$|The {{commensal}} {{relationship between}} a snailfish, tentatively identified as Careproctus sp. (Osteichthyes: Liparidae), and <b>the</b> lithodid <b>crab</b> Paralomis formosa (Crustacea: Lithodidae) was photographed in situ using a baited camera vehicle, deployed at depths of 625 - 1525 m around Shag Rocks and South Georgia in the Southern Ocean. The series of time-lapse photographs taken clearly showed that the small liparid fish `hitched rides' on <b>the</b> <b>crabs,</b> presumably attaching to the dorsal carapace and legs of <b>the</b> <b>crabs</b> by means of their ventral sucking disk. Liparid fish of 20 - 90 mm total length, corresponding to juveniles and adult sizes, were observed on <b>the</b> <b>crabs</b> and indicate that Careproctus sp. is closely associated with P. formosa {{for the whole of}} the life cycle of the fish. Such an association may provide the snailfish with protection from potential predators as well as a means of transport towards food-falls but at no apparent cost to <b>the</b> <b>crabs...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{a higher}} boiler {{pressure}} than <b>the</b> <b>Crabs</b> <b>the</b> cylinders were 3" [...] smaller in diameter and so the cylinders were able to be mounted horizontally: the only Stanier design to do so.

5|$|The 2010 {{game would}} be the first to award <b>the</b> <b>Crab</b> Bowl Trophy to the winner. 69,348 fans turned out to see the game at M Bank Stadium in Baltimore, which was {{considered}} a home game for Maryland. Navy dominated the game statistically, controlling the ball for nearly 40 minutes and gaining 485 yards. The Midshipmen also converted 10 of 18 third-down chances. But their errors and failure to convert near the goal line cost them dearly. Navy kicker Joe Buckley missed a 32-yard field goal attempt, quarterback Ricky Dobbs lost a fumble at the Maryland 1-yard line, and Maryland eventually walked away with a 17–14 victory.|$|E
