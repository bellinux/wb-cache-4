40|$|In 1954, {{at the age}} of 5 years, {{our patient}} had an encephalitic {{syndrome}} associated with a prolonged lethargic state. After this episode, he developed a severe parkinsonian syndrome that, after a few years, was associated with axial dystonia and stereotyped abnormal movements of the upper limbs. This complex and progressive <b>extrapyramidal</b> <b>syndrome</b> had many similarities to the encephalitis lethargica as described by von Economo. Results of cerebral computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were normal. Fluorodopa positron emission tomography showed a significant bilateral reduction of tracer accumulation in both putamen, similar to that observed in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. However, in this patient, treatment with L-Dopa suppressed all akinetic, dystonic and dyskinetic symptoms. The effectiveness of L-Dopa was abolished by administration of a D 2 antagonist and was fully reproduced by a D 2 agonist. In conclusion, this patient presented a complex postencephalitic, <b>extrapyramidal</b> <b>syndrome,</b> with akinetic symptoms and involuntary movements.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Extrapyramidal</b> <b>syndromes</b> (EPS) are {{clinically}} relevant {{side effects}} of metoclopramide which are often not anticipated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two patients who received metoclopramide developed an acute dystonic reaction. Symptoms disappeared after biperiden or trihexyphenidyl were given. Molecular analysis of the CYP 2 D 6 gene was performed using a PCR-based method. RESULTS: Both patients were homozygous for inactive CYP 2 D 6 alleles (CYP 2 D 6 * 4 /* 4 and CYP 2 D 6 * 4 /* 5), which are associated with slow drug metabolism. CONCLUSION: Metoclopramide-induced acute dystonic reactions may occur in patients carrying a CYP 2 D 6 genetic polymorphism...|$|R

40|$|Neuroleptic {{drugs are}} {{essential}} {{in the treatment}} of schizophrenia and many other psychiatric disorders. These drugs do however cause a wide range of side effects which can be very distressing to patients.

Fort Napier Hospital is a large psychiatric referral hospital and the majority of patients admitted require neuroleptic drug treatment.

40|$|Three {{patients}} developed {{akinetic mutism}} {{on the third}} day after the introduction of intravenous cyclosporin A, given for immunosuppression after liver transplantation.

40|$|Two {{cases of}} parkinsonism after {{recurrent}} obstructive hydrocephalus due to idiopathic aqueductal stenosis are reported.

The seven previously reported cases of this syndrome were reviewed and it is concluded that the prognosis of the parkinsonism is good, usually with total, or near total, resolution. It is recommended that if a patient with idiopathic aqueduct stenosis develops hydrocephalus or evidence of shunt malfunction in association with acute parkinsonism their shunt should be replaced. If {{there is no evidence of}} hydrocephalus or shunt malfunction they should initially be treated with domaminergic medication. ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{extrapyramidal}} {{diseases are}} commonly thought to solely affect the extrapyramidal motor system, nonmotor {{symptoms such as}} behavioural abnormalities, dysautonomia, sleep disturbances and sensory dysfunctions are also frequently observed. Autonomic dysfunction as an important clinical component of extrapyramidal disease (idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, dementia with Lewy bodies) is often not formally assessed and thus frequently misdiagnosed. Symptoms of autonomic dysfunction in general impact more on quality of life than motor symptoms.
