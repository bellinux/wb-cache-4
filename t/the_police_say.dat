25|$|In December, 1997, several Canadian {{police forces}} formed a {{joint task force}} to manage their {{investigation}} into sniper attacks against three Canadian doctors, Romalis of Vancouver; Hugh Short of Ancaster, Ontario; and Jack Fainman of Winnipeg, Manitoba. On the joint task force were representatives of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the police forces of Vancouver, Hamilton, and Winnipeg. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>say</b> that sniper attacks against Canadian physicians are terrorist acts and that {{the hunt for the}} attackers deserves a coordinated national effort. In 2001, James Kopp was charged with the shooting of Dr. Hugh Short and is suspected of committing the other two shootings. Kopp is currently in prison in the USA for the 1998 sniper-style murder of Barnett Slepian, an American physician from Amherst, New York who performed abortions.|$|E

Masood calls in the police, and they make sure that Kamil is safe, but we're left to wonder if he will stay that way. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>say</b> that they can't get involved in domestic disputes, so Masood says, 'Well, what about the father's rights? If a mother reported this, you'd see it as kidnap'. I thought that was a great line and really interesting - I think in that moment, Masood's representing a lot of fathers who have separated or divorced and don't have access to their children in the same way." ...|$|E

Five uniformed officers responded. What happened next is still in dispute. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>say</b> they were overpowered and assaulted when they arrived; imam Louis Farrakhan and the other worshippers present say the police interrupted them with guns drawn during prayers and refused repeated requests to wait or at least leave behind their guns, which the Black Muslims' faith forbade from being carried into a place of worship. At a press conference {{the next day he}} would claim it was a premeditated attack and the 9-1-1 call just a ruse.|$|E
2500|$|Philip's husband, {{brother and}} family dispute {{much of what}} <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>say</b> and their interpretations of the {{documentary}} evidence. She was fired from Cabrini not because of alcoholism but {{because she had been}} a [...] "whistleblower" [...] who complained about racial and sexual bias (the hospital later told a reporter it had no evidence of any formal complaints by her). Lieberman says that while his wife frequented lesbian bars, it was because she did not want a repeat of the situation that had happened with her coworker. She never had sex with the women she went home with, he claims, and they would often merely listen to music, sleep or paint. One time, in fact, she came home covered with paint after going home with an artist. Her drinking was a temporary phase to ease her through the depression she was experiencing after being fired by Cabrini, and would stop once her life got back to normal, as he believed it was doing.|$|E

2500|$|The {{body of a}} third protester, Eugen Ţapu, {{was handed}} to the {{relatives}} by the police on 16 April. The official {{cause of death was}} given as suicide by hanging, however, the relatives disputed this because they claim that he had no marks on the neck to suggest this. According to Victor Său, the mayor of Ţapu's home village Soroca, there is a link between Eugen Ţapu's death and the protest from 7 April because the police refuse to provide further explanations and the dates of his death and the protest's day are the same. Său stated that police refused to provide any explanations on the reasons behind the death of Eugen Tapu, and that according to the papers he died on 7 April, the day when police begin the mass arrests of young protesters. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>say</b> they found the decomposing body of Eugen Ţapu on 15 April, hanging from his bootlaces in the attic of a building in the capital. [...] "They killed him, that's for sure, and they must answer for what they've done" [...] said Eugen's father.|$|E

After failing to obtain £100 from Michelle, Dennis tells Louise about Michelle and Preston's relationship, while Bex and Preston decide to make their relationship official. Louise tells Bex that Michelle and Preston are having sex but Bex refuses to believe it, but when she sees Preston {{put his hand on}} Michelle's shoulder and Michelle flinch, Bex publicly asks {{if it is true that}} Michelle is having sex with her boyfriend. Louise reveals the truth and Martin attacks Preston and disowns Michelle. A drunk Michelle frantically tries to find Preston, getting into Phil's car having taken sleeping pills. Speeding around the square, Michelle is shocked to see Preston, who jumps out of the way of the car and as she swerves, she crashes into the chip shop where Kathy and Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami) are. Michelle is rushed to hospital, where she needs an operation after rupturing her spleen. She is later discharged but is angered upon learning that Sharon has convinced Preston to return to the States. Michelle decides to return to the States but Sharon convinces her to attend the police station to be interviewed over the crash. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>say</b> that the CPS will assess if she should be charged with an offence, confiscating her passport so she cannot leave the country.|$|E
2500|$|On September 21, Ravi sent {{a friend}} {{a series of}} text messages, {{including}} messages saying, [...] "Yeah, keep the gays away" [...] and [...] "People are having a viewing party {{with a bottle of}} Bacardi and beer in this kid's room for my roommate" [...] along with directions on how to view it remotely. At 6:39p.m., Ravi tweeted, [...] "Anyone with iChat, I dare you to video chat me between the hours of 9:30 and 12. Yes, it's happening again." [...] Ravi had set up the webcam and initially pointed it towards Clementi's bed.

When Ravi's friend suggested that Clementi and his guest might use his bed, Ravi said [...] "My webcam checks my bed, hahaha." [...] At trial, two Rutgers students testified that Ravi had spent part of that early evening in their dorm rooms, and used their computers to verify that the webcam was still focused on the bed. The captain of Ravi's Ultimate Frisbee team testified that, after practice that evening, Ravi [...] "told me he had set up a webcam of some sort to capture images of his roommate. He told me he had done it before that date" [...] and [...] "that he was planning on doing it again. That night." [...] When Clementi returned to his room, he noticed the camera and texted a friend saying he had unplugged Ravi's powerstrip to prevent further video streaming during his date. Ravi has said that he had changed his mind regarding the broadcast and disabled the camera himself by putting the computer in sleep mode.|$|E

60|$|All {{this the}} philanthropist was {{constrained}} to admit; but he was, not unnaturally, quite unable to submit any explanation of his proceedings. What chiefly discomfited {{him was the}} fact that his proceedings were a matter of interest and observation. Why, he kept wondering, was all this fuss made about a coat which had, or had not, been left by a traveller at the hotel? It was perfectly plain that the hotel was used as a souricière, as <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>say,</b> as a trap in which all inquirers after the coat could be captured. Now, if he had been given time (and a French dictionary), Maitland might have set before the Commissaire of Police the whole story of his troubles. He might have begun with the discovery of Shields' body in the snow; he might have gone on to Margaret's disappearance (enlèvement), and to a description of the costume (bearskin coat and all) of the villain who had carried her away. Then he might have described his relations with Margaret, the necessity of finding her, the clew offered by the advertisement in the Times, and his own too subtle and ingenious attempt to follow up that clew. But it is improbable that this narrative, had Maitland told it ever so movingly, would have entirely satisfied the suspicions of the Commissaire of Police. It might even have prejudiced that official against Maitland. Moreover, the Fellow of St. Gatien's had neither the presence of mind nor the linguistic resources necessary to relate the whole plot and substance of this narrative, at a moment's notice, in a cold police-office, to a sceptical alien. He therefore fell back on a demand to be allowed to communicate with the English Ambassador; and that night Maitland of Gatien's passed, for the first time during his blameless career, in a police-cell.|$|E
