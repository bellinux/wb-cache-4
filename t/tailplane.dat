5|$|A {{total of}} 50 of the early-production Mk IIs were {{modified}} into trainers as the Mark III, by adding dual controls and instruments {{for the student}} pilot and an externally braced <b>tailplane.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite {{reports that}} a {{prototype}} began taxiing tests on 30 June 1948, {{it is now clear}} that no prototype was actually built and that only manufacturing of the <b>tailplane</b> may have begun.|$|E
5|$|The prototypes {{performed}} well; however, several design failings led to {{the loss}} of WB771 on 14 July 1954, when the <b>tailplane</b> detached whilst making a low-level pass over the runway at Cranfield, causing the aircraft to crash with the loss of the crew. Attached to the fin using three bolts, the <b>tailplane</b> was subject to considerably more stress than had been anticipated, and the three bolts failed due to metal fatigue. Additionally, the prototypes were considerably tail heavy {{due to the lack of}} equipment in the nose; this was remedied by large ballast weights being fitted upon the prototypes. Production Victors had a lengthened nose that also served to move the crew escape door further from the engine intakes. The fin was shortened to eliminate the potential for flutter while the <b>tailplane</b> attachment was changed to a stronger four-bolt fixing.|$|E

50|$|The tail {{assembly}} was conventional, featuring slab all-moving <b>tailplanes</b> with an anhedral of 15°. The steep anhedral {{kept the}} <b>tailplanes</b> {{out of the}} engine exhaust while allowing them to remain effective through the wing wash. Like the Jaguar, there was a fixed ventral fin under each exhaust, while two hydraulically operated airbrakes are fitted just forward of each ventral fin.|$|R
5|$|The Su-25 has a {{conventional}} aerodynamic layout with a shoulder-mounted trapezoidal wing and a traditional <b>tailplane</b> and rudder. Several metals {{are used in}} the construction of the airframe: 60% aluminium, 19% steel, 13.5% titanium, 2% magnesium alloy and 5.5% other materials.|$|E
5|$|The skins of the fuselage, {{wings and}} <b>tailplane</b> were secured by rivets, and in {{critical}} {{areas such as}} the wing forward of the main spar where an uninterrupted airflow was required, with flush rivets; the fuselage used standard dome-headed riveting. From February 1943 flush riveting was used on the fuselage, affecting all Spitfire variants. In some areas, such as {{at the rear of the}} wing, and the lower <b>tailplane</b> skins, the top was riveted and the bottom fixed by brass screws which tapped into strips of spruce bolted to the lower ribs. The removable wing tips were made up of duralumin-skinned spruce formers. At first the ailerons, elevators and rudder were fabric-covered. When combat experience showed that fabric-covered ailerons were impossible to use at high speeds, a light alloy replaced the fabric, enhancing control throughout the speed range.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, {{before the}} flight {{testing of the}} prototypes was completed, 30 {{production}} aircraft were ordered. They incorporated an ejection seat and a redesigned vertical stabilizer {{as well as two}} auxiliary fins, one towards the tip {{on each side of the}} <b>tailplane</b> in an attempt to improve the directional stability of the aircraft. The fuselage was lengthened to fit additional equipment and the wing had fillets added at the rear junction with the fuselage.|$|E

5|$|The flaps {{are mounted}} by steel sliders and rollers, {{attached}} to brackets {{on the rear}} spar. The trapezoidal ailerons are near the wingtips. The fuselage of the Su-25 has an ellipsoidal section and is of semi-monocoque, stressed-skin construction, arranged as a longitudinal load-bearing framework of longerons, beams and stringers, with a transverse load-bearing assembly of frames. The one-piece horizontal <b>tailplane</b> {{is attached to the}} load-bearing frame at two mounting points.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had not had}} any mechanical {{or technical}} errors or problems prior to take-off. The turbulence and wind shear caused a crack in either the tail rudder, the <b>tailplane,</b> or both. This was caused by strong winds acting {{on both sides of}} the structure, due to shifting winds. These structural failures caused the aircraft to crash. Out of the 63 seconds from take-off to impact, the aircraft was under control for the first 55 seconds; only during the last 8 seconds did the crew not have control over the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The ellipse {{also served}} as the design basis for the Spitfire's fin and <b>tailplane</b> assembly, once again {{exploiting}} the shape's favourable aerodynamic characteristics. Both the elevators and rudder were shaped so that their centre of mass was shifted forward, thus reducing control-surface flutter. The longer noses and greater propeller-wash resulting from larger engines in later models necessitated increasingly larger vertical and, later, horizontal tail surfaces {{to compensate for the}} altered aerodynamics, culminating in those of the Mk 22/24 series which were 25% larger in area than those of the Mk I.|$|E
50|$|A tandem wing {{design has}} two wings, one behind the other: see <b>Tailplanes</b> and foreplanes below. Some early types had tandem stacks of {{multiple}} planes—see {{the article on}} multiplanes.|$|R
5000|$|A triplane is a {{fixed-wing}} aircraft equipped with three vertical stacked wing planes. <b>Tailplanes</b> and canard foreplanes are not normally {{included in this}} count, although they may be occasionally.|$|R
5000|$|Investigator finally {{concluded}} {{the cause of}} the accident:"The accident was caused by the rupture of the rear pressure bulkhead, which led to the separation both <b>tailplanes</b> in flight and caused the aircraft to dive into the ground." ...|$|R
5|$|Finucane's {{start at}} No. 452 was unimpressive. On 3 May 1941 {{while on a}} {{recognition}} flight with his new commanding officer, Squadron Leader Roy Dutton, Finucane got too close and his propeller sliced through Dutton's <b>tailplane.</b> Finucane radioed Dutton immediately. Dutton attempted to abandon the aircraft but was too low and crash-landed, cracking several ribs but surviving. Finucane excused himself from error asserting that his Spitfire {{was the only one}} with a metal propeller—the others being elder Mark I's with wooden mounts—which gave him extra speed. In tight formation, this had caused the collision. Despite the incident, he was gazetted on 13 May and given temporary command of the squadron while Dutton was injured. While at 452 Finucane became a popular commander and encouraged a more relaxed atmosphere, which he believed would help him get more out of the Australian pilots. He was now in command of 23 pilots, 16 fighters and 130 ground crew.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the termination, {{the stock}} price of Braathens {{increased}} by 16%, while SAS's increased 3%. Immediately following the bankruptcy, the two airlines increased their prices. Subsequently, Braathens increased their ticket price by 15%, but stated that this {{had nothing to do with}} the elimination of competition, since the price increase was not on any Oslo routes. In November, Braathens started to remove routes, and announced they would increase prices by 20%. They also reintroduced the Flag of Norway on the <b>tailplane</b> that since the rebranding had been replaced by a silver, abstract wing. Both Braathens and SAS lost more than NOK1 billion in 1999, and the total cost of the price war between the three airlines exceeded NOK 3 billion.|$|E
5|$|The 767 entered {{service with}} United Airlines on September 8, 1982. The aircraft's first {{commercial}} flight used a JT9D-powered 767-200 on the Chicago-to-Denver route. The CF6-powered 767-200 commenced service {{three months later}} with Delta Air Lines. Upon delivery, early 767s were mainly deployed on domestic routes, including US transcontinental services. American Airlines and TWA began flying the 767-200 in late 1982, while Air Canada, China Airlines, and El Al began operating the aircraft in 1983. The aircraft's introduction was relatively smooth, with few operational glitches and greater dispatch reliability than prior jetliners. In its first year, the 767 logged a 96.1percent dispatch rate, which exceeded the industry average for new aircraft. Operators reported generally favorable ratings for the twinjet's sound levels, interior comfort, and economic performance. Resolved issues were minor and included the recalibration of a leading edge sensor to prevent false readings, the replacement of an evacuation slide latch, and the repair of a <b>tailplane</b> pivot to match production specifications.|$|E
50|$|The XF13C first flew in 1934 {{with good}} results {{realized}} in tests. In 1935, the aircraft received {{a more powerful}} engine and modifications to the overly tall <b>tailplanes.</b> The designation was changed to XF13C-3 for more flight testing.|$|R
5000|$|The HT-180 is a {{turbojet}} powered subsonic drone {{currently under}} development by NCHU. The HT-180 has a cylindrical fuselage with a pointed nose cone and swept wings. Side intake are mounted between the swept wing and <b>tailplanes.</b> Specifications: ...|$|R
50|$|The Tu-128 had a broad, low/mid-mounted {{swept wing}} {{carrying}} the {{main landing gear}} in wing-mounted pods, and slab <b>tailplanes.</b> Two Lyulka AL-7F-2 turbojet engines were mounted in the fuselage. The two-man crew of pilot and navigator were seated in tandem.|$|R
5|$|The TSR-2 {{was to be}} {{powered by}} two Bristol-Siddeley Olympus reheated turbojets, {{advanced}} variants of those used in the Avro Vulcan. The Olympus would be further developed and would power the supersonic Concorde. The design featured a small shoulder-mounted delta wing with down-turned tips, an all-moving swept <b>tailplane</b> and a large all-moving fin. Blown flaps were fitted across the entire trailing edge of the wing to achieve the short takeoff and landing requirement, something that later designs would achieve with the technically more complex swing-wing approach. No ailerons were fitted, control in roll instead being implemented by differential movement of the slab tailplanes. The wing loading was high for its time, enabling the aircraft to fly at very high speed and low level with great stability without being constantly upset by thermals and other ground-related weather phenomena. The EE Chief Test Pilot, Wing Commander Roland Beamont, favourably compared the TSR-2's supersonic flying characteristics to the Canberra's own subsonic flight characteristics, stating that the Canberra was more troublesome.|$|E
5|$|The design {{proposed}} by Handley Page {{in response to}} B.35/46 was given the internal designation of HP.80. To achieve the required performance, Handley Page's aerodynamicist Dr. Gustav Lachmann and his deputy, Godfrey Lee developed a crescent-shaped swept wing for the HP.80; the sweep and chord of the wing decreased in three distinct steps from the root to the tip, to ensure a constant limiting Mach number across the entire wing and consequently a high cruise speed. Early work on the project included tailless aircraft designs, which would have used wing-tip vertical surfaces instead; however as the proposal matured a high-mounted, full <b>tailplane</b> was adopted instead. The profile and shaping of the crescent wing was subject to considerable fine-tuning and alterations throughout the early development stages, particularly to counter unfavourable pitching behaviour in flight.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} process had involved {{extensive use of}} physical models; for one series of blowing trials, mixtures of focused hot and cold air were directed onto ground platforms to simulate the ground effect upon take-off. This work {{was considered to be}} critical to the project as there was very little knowledge of the adverse effects which could influence the aircraft during the vertical takeoff process; as there was no airflow over the ailerons, <b>tailplane,</b> and rudder while the aircraft was held in a stationary hover, wingtip control jets were experimented with as an alternative reaction control approach. These research included the development of an all-new control response simulator which linked a series of simple flying controls to a computer. By the end of 1958, barely eighteen months after the start of the project, all the main features of the P.1127 were developed with one exception, that being the reaction control system, the development of which was completed by April 1959.|$|E

5000|$|II-250 series UAV is {{a family}} of jet powered UAVs that {{resemble}} cruise missiles, which {{they are designed to}} simulate. II-250 series UAVs have a cylindrical fuselage with inverted v-tail and a pair of swept wing of high wing configuration mounted in the midsection. A pair of swept <b>tailplanes</b> are mounted in high wing configuration at the empennage and there is also a small swept vertical stabilizer mounted perpendicularly to the <b>tailplanes.</b> Instead of being turbojet powered like the II-150 series UAV, II-250 series UAVs utilizes rocket motor instead. Like II-150 series, there are also three models of II-250 series UAV, with the basic II-150 for PLAGF, II-250K for PLAAF, and II-250H for PLAN. Specification: ...|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} control near and above the speed of sound, it is often necessary to use either power operated all-flying <b>tailplanes</b> (stabilators), or delta wings fitted with power operated elevons. Power operation prevents aerodynamic forces overriding the pilots' control inputs.|$|R
5|$|The 'Best' and 'Back' {{service was}} highly criticized by analysts and customers. Braathens SAFE {{had a strong}} image, and unlike SAS, that was branded as 'The Businessman's Airline', Braathens SAFE {{was seen as the}} people's airline. It also drew {{goodwill}} from being Norwegian-owned, and that it displayed the Flag of Norway on the <b>tailplane.</b> Prior to the rebranding, no airline in Norway had ever operated a two-class service on domestic flights—including SAS. Professor of Sociology Per Morten Schiefloe commented that the introduction of segregation of passengers offended passengers. Customers who previously had been paying full price, became more aware of the savings on using 'Back' tickets. At the same time, people who wanted to travel with discounted tickets felt that they got better service and were not treated as second-rate customers with SAS. This caused Braathens to lose customers at both ends. The rebranding itself not only cost money to initiate, but also increased operating expenses, because cabin crew needed to move the curtain depending on the number of passengers on each class. Planes were sometimes delayed for hours, particularly {{in the beginning of the}} service, due to the increased work load on the handling and cabin crew.|$|E
25|$|The right <b>tailplane</b> {{was missing}} from the main wreckage.

50|$|NUAA {{unmanned}} flying wing is an UAV in flying wing configuration, and it {{made its}} public debut in 2011 AVIC Industrial Cup competition of UAV designs held in Beijing. NUAA flying wing looks very similar to another completely unrelated Chinese unmanned flying wing, AVIC 601-S Wind Blade because both are intended to explore technologies of flying wing, and both are transitional designs in that in comparison to more primitive designs that still retain <b>tailplanes,</b> these design have <b>tailplanes</b> eliminated. However, these designs are not advanced enough to completely eliminate vertical control surfaces, so they utilize winglets to assist flight control. Propulsion of NUAA flying wing is housed in a nacelle atop of the fuselage and the nacelle is integrated smoothly into the fuselage.|$|R
