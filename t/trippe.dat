5|$|The 747 was {{conceived}} while air travel was increasing in the 1960s. The era of commercial jet transportation, {{led by the}} enormous popularity of the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, had revolutionized long-distance travel. Even before it lost the CX-HLS contract, Boeing was asked by Juan <b>Trippe,</b> president of Pan American World Airways (Pan Am), {{one of their most}} important airline customers, to build a passenger aircraft more than twice the size of the 707. During this time, airport congestion, worsened by increasing numbers of passengers carried on relatively small aircraft, became a problem that <b>Trippe</b> thought could be addressed by a larger new aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Upon its {{retirement}} from service, the 747 number {{two in the}} production line was dismantled and shipped to Hopyeong, Namyangju, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea where it was re-assembled, repainted in a livery {{similar to that of}} Air Force One and converted into a restaurant. Originally flown commercially by Pan Am as N747PA, Clipper Juan T. <b>Trippe,</b> and repaired for service following a tailstrike, it stayed with the airline until its bankruptcy. The restaurant closed by 2009, and the aircraft was scrapped in 2010.|$|E
25|$|A {{controversy}} {{that hit the}} band in 1988 was a lawsuit by Matthew <b>Trippe.</b> <b>Trippe</b> claimed that Nikki Sixx was hospitalized in 1983 after a car crash involving drugs {{and that he had}} been hired as Nikki's doppelgänger. The suit was regarding the loss of royalties from his time in Mötley Crüe and the case was not closed until 1993 when <b>Trippe</b> dropped his charges and disappeared from public view.|$|E

Two months later, AMA Pro Road Racing announced that the new class would be called GT3, an expansion of the SunTrust Moto-GT.|$|R
25|$|When Juan <b>Trippe</b> had {{the company}} offices {{relocated}} to New York City, he rented {{space in a}} building on 42nd Street. This facility was across from the Grand Central Terminal.

25|$|<b>Trippe</b> and his {{associates}} planned to extend Pan Am's network through all of Central and South America. During the late 1920s and early 1930s, Pan Am purchased a number of ailing or defunct airlines in Central and South America and negotiated with postal officials to win most of the government's airmail contracts to the region. In September 1929 <b>Trippe</b> toured Latin America with Charles Lindbergh to negotiate landing rights {{in a number of}} countries, including Barranquilla on SCADTA's home turf of Colombia, Maracaibo and Caracas. By the end of the year, Pan Am offered flights along the west coast of South America to Peru. The following year, Pan Am purchased the New York, Rio, and Buenos Aires Line, giving it a seaplane route along the east coast of South America to Buenos Aires, Argentina, and westbound to Santiago, Chile. Its Brazilian subsidiary NYRBA do Brasil was later renamed as Panair do Brasil. Pan Am also partnered with Grace Shipping Company in 1929 to form Pan American-Grace Airways, better known as Panagra, to gain a foothold to destinations in South America. In the same year, Pan Am acquired a controlling stake in Mexicana de Aviación and took over Mexicana's Ford Trimotor route between Brownsville, Texas and Mexico City, extending this service to the Yucatan Peninsula to connect with Pan Am's Caribbean route network.|$|E
50|$|On November 29, 1945 Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) {{became the}} launch {{customer}} {{with the largest}} commercial aircraft order in history, a $24,500,000 order for 20 Stratocruisers. Earlier in 1945 a Boeing C-97 had flown from Seattle to Washington, D.C. nonstop in six hours and four minutes; with this knowledge, and with Pan Am President Juan <b>Trippe's</b> high regard for Boeing after their success with the Boeing 314 Clipper, Pan Am was confident in ordering the expensive plane.|$|R
5000|$|Designed to meet Pan American Airways President Juan <b>Trippe's</b> {{desire for}} a trans-Pacific aircraft, the M-130 was an {{all-metal}} flying boat with streamlined aerodynamics and powerful engines, selling at US$ 417,000, to achieve Pan Am's specified range and payload. The first flight was on December 30, 1934. On November 22, 1935, the China Clipper, piloted by Captain Edwin C. Musick and First Officer R.O.D. Sullivan, flew the first trans-Pacific airmail route. [...] As illustrated on this page, a postage stamp, Scott Catalog C-20, was printed for use on the transpacific service. With extended service, two more denominations were later issued. All three have the same design showing the M-130 in flight.|$|R
50|$|The {{railroad}} {{was never}} financially successful and never paid off any interest on its original one million dollar mortgage. Starting in 1921, {{with the construction}} of highways throughout the territory, revenues began to decrease. The destruction of the luxurious Belvedere Hotel by a fire on March 30, 1923 further limited business. In 1929, under new management, an attempt to rehabilitate the line was made and operations continued with the hope that a new ferry across the Chesapeake Bay to a point on <b>Trippe's</b> Bay in Dorchester County would drive new business. The ferry was blocked by the Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Company, a competing ferry out of Annapolis and in 1935, management decided to replace the railroad with a bus line. The last train left the station on April 15, 1935.|$|R
25|$|Pan Am's holding company, the Aviation Corporation of the Americas, {{was one of}} {{the most}} sought after stocks on the New York Curb Exchange in 1929, and flurries of {{speculation}} surrounded each of its new route awards. In April 1929 <b>Trippe</b> and his associates reached an agreement with United Aircraft and Transport Corporation (UATC) to segregate Pan Am operations to south of the Mexico – United States border, in exchange for UATC taking a large shareholder stake (UATC was the parent company of what are now Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, and United Airlines). The Aviation Corporation of the Americas changed its name to Pan American Airways Corporation in 1931.|$|E
25|$|Juan <b>Trippe</b> {{formed the}} Aviation Corporation of the Americas (ACA) on June 2, 1927, with {{the backing of}} {{powerful}} and politically connected financiers who included Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney and W. Averell Harriman, and raised $250,000 in startup capital from the sale of stock. Their operation had the all-important landing rights for Havana, having acquired American International Airways, a small airline established in 1926 by John K. Montgomery and Richard B. Bevier as a seaplane service from Key West, Florida, to Havana. ACA met its deadline of having an air mail service operating by October 19, 1927 by chartering a Fairchild FC-2 floatplane from a small Dominican Republic carrier, West Indian Aerial Express.|$|E
25|$|Lindbergh and Pan American World Airways head Juan <b>Trippe</b> were {{interested}} in developing a great circle air route across Alaska and Siberia to China and Japan. In the summer of 1931, with Trippe's support, Lindbergh and his wife flew from Long Island to Nome, Alaska {{and from there to}} Siberia, Japan and China. The route was not available for commercial service until after World WarII, as prewar aircraft lacked the range to fly Alaska to Japan nonstop, and the United States had not officially recognized the Soviet government. In China they volunteered to help in disaster investigation and relief efforts for the Central China flood of 1931. This was later documented in Anne's book North to the Orient.|$|E
2500|$|The {{railroad}} {{was never}} financially successful and never paid off any interest on its original one million dollar mortgage.

50|$|The {{design was}} given the {{designation}} L-049 or Excalibur A. The wings of the aircraft {{were similar to those}} used by the P-38 Lightning fighter. The aircraft was to be powered by four Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone radials with the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 as the back-up. Re-designed, the Excalibur was to be priced at $450,000, making it the most expensive airliner on the drawing board. Since TWA was unable to provide funding, Howard Hughes had his other company, the Hughes Tool Company, fund the construction of the airliner. Hughes ordered 40 Excaliburs on July 10, 1940, making the order the largest in airline history at the time. The development was to be kept a secret until the 35th aircraft was delivered to TWA. This was done in order to keep competitors such as Juan <b>Trippe's</b> Pan American World Airways from ordering the aircraft and competing with TWA. The secret was apparently well kept.|$|R
25|$|Since the 1930s Juan <b>Trippe</b> had coveted {{domestic}} routes for Pan Am. Through the late 1950s and early 1960s, {{and in the}} mid-1970s, there were talks of merging the airline with a domestic operator such as American Airlines, Eastern Air Lines, Trans World Airlines or United Airlines. As rival airlines convinced Congress that Pan Am would use its political clout to monopolize U.S. air routes, the CAB repeatedly denied the airline permission {{to operate in the}} U.S., by growth or by a merger with another airline. Pan Am remained an American carrier operating international routes only (aside from Hawaii and Alaska). The last time Pan Am was permitted to merge with another airline prior to the deregulation of the U.S. airline industry was in 1950, when it took over American Overseas Airlines from American Airlines. After deregulation in 1978, more U.S. domestic airlines began competing with Pan Am internationally.|$|E
500|$|In April 1966, Pan Am ordered 25 747-100 {{aircraft}} for US$525million. During {{the ceremonial}} 747 contract-signing banquet in Seattle on Boeing's 50th Anniversary, Juan <b>Trippe</b> {{predicted that the}} 747 would be [...] "... a great weapon for peace, competing with intercontinental missiles for mankind's destiny". As launch customer, and because of its early involvement before placing a formal order, Pan Am was able to influence the design {{and development of the}} 747 to an extent unmatched by a single airline before or since.|$|E

2500|$|The basis {{was that}} Stavanger Airport, Sola on the Norwegian West Coast {{was to be}} the hub. The {{delegation}} hoped to procure a Boeing 314, giving a capacity for 20 passengers and [...] of freight. One intermediate landing, planned at Botwood in Newfoundland, was needed before reaching New York. The trip was planned to take 26 and a half hours, comparing to the 13 days it took the delegation to reach Washington, D.C. Preparatory meetings with the Scandinavian ambassadors started on 26 January, followed by two months of negotiations with American authorities, manufacturers, airlines and airports, to insure rights to all aspects of the operations, including training of crew, insurance, agreements with the United States Postal Service, choice of route, weather services and schedules. The neutral American authorities were interested in establishing a route to the then-neutral Scandinavian countries, and the negotiations went well, with all necessary permissions and contracts gained. Pan Am and Juan <b>Trippe</b> set as a condition that the four countries establish a single consortium to function as Pan Am's counter-party. It was decided that Aerotransport initially would function as the counter-party.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Trippe</b> {{decided to}} start a service from San Francisco to Honolulu and on to Hong Kong and Auckland {{following}} steamship routes. After negotiating traffic rights in 1934 to land at Pearl Harbor, Midway Island, Wake Island, Guam, and Subic Bay (Manila), Pan Am shipped $500,000 worth of aeronautical equipment westward in March 1935 using the North Haven, [...] a 15,000 ton merchant ship it chartered {{for the purpose of}} provisioning each island that the clippers would stop at on their 4 to 5-day flight. [...] Pan Am ran its first survey flight to Honolulu in April 1935 with a Sikorsky S-42 flying boat. The airline won the contract for a San Francisco – Canton mail route later that year and operated its first commercial flight carrying mail and express (no passengers) in a Martin M-130 from Alameda to Manila amid media fanfare on November 22, 1935. The five-leg, 8,000-mile (12,875km) flight arrived in Manila on November 29 and returned to San Francisco on December 6, cutting the time between the two cities via the fastest scheduled steamship by over two weeks. (Both the United States and Philippine Islands issued special stamps for the two flights.) The first passenger flight left Alameda on October 21, 1936.
