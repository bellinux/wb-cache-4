50|$|After {{completing}} his military service, {{he was an}} associate at the Rockefeller Institute in New York City starting in 1946. He was {{on the faculty of}} Western Reserve University starting in 1951, where research he conducted showed that adenoviruses, which could lie dormant in the adenoids for extended periods, were among the causes of atypical pneumonia and acute respiratory disease. Ginsberg showed the process by which the adenovirus caused disease after entering host cells, leading <b>to</b> the <b>creation</b> of <b>vaccines</b> against various infectious diseases and showing how cancers could be triggered by oncoviruses.|$|R
40|$|Ticks {{are one of}} {{the most}} common ectoparasites in the world and they are vectors of many tick-borne {{diseases}}. These diseases are caused by pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. The main point of the thesis is focused on enhancement of pathogens transmission, (especially Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the causative agent of Lyme disease) by tick saliva or salivary glands extracts, and I tried to refer the main molecules, which have immunomodulatory or inhibition effect on the immunity of host. This effect can lead to the enhancement of pathogens transmission and contributes to their extension in host. The second part of the thesis is based on molecules, which can lead <b>to</b> the <b>creation</b> of <b>vaccines</b> against tick-borne diseases...|$|R
40|$|Most {{vaccines}} created {{today are}} costly to produce. In addition, the <b>creation</b> of new <b>vaccines</b> <b>to</b> combat emerging {{diseases such as}} novel influenza strains such as H 1 N 1 and SARS is slow and not {{able to meet the}} demand early in the disease cycle. The current invention developed by researchers at the University of Missouri is a new vaccine platform utilizing inactivated spores that is easy to customize to a disease of interest. The time between identification of an emerging pathogen <b>to</b> <b>vaccine</b> <b>creation</b> can be shortened to as little as 3 weeks. By utilizing bacterial cells that to high titers in simple growth medium, large batches of vaccine can be made in little time with immunogenic proteins surface displayed on the spores. Cost and time savings are achieved because no protein purification steps are required. The spores are easily inactivated and stable in the absence of refrigeration. Bacterial spores are recognized by the immune system as foreign and have the natural ability to stimulate the immune system and lead to effective immune responses. Thus our platform system should not need the use of adjuvants to produce a robust immune response. Lastly, {{we have the ability to}} express proteins from different antigen sources to create a multivalent vaccine against multiple pathogens.

40|$|Pandemic {{influenza}} A {{viruses that}} emerge from animal reservoirs are inevitable. Therefore, rapid genomic analysis and <b>creation</b> of <b>vaccines</b> are vital. We developed a multisegment reverse transcription-PCR (M-RTPCR) approach that simultaneously amplifies eight genomic RNA segments, irrespective of virus subtype. M-RTPCR amplicons {{can be used for}} high-throughput sequencing and/or cloned into modified reverse-genetics plasmids via regions of sequence identity. We used these procedures to rescue a contemporary H 3 N 2 virus and a swine origin H 1 N 1 virus directly from human swab specimens. Together, M-RTPCR and the modified reverse-genetics plasmids that we designed streamline the <b>creation</b> of <b>vaccine</b> seed stocks (9 to 12 days) ...|$|R
