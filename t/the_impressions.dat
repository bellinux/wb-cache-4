5|$|But {{the aliens}} became extinct before {{completing}} their work. As {{the human race}} bred and evolved, only a percentage retained their psychic abilities, which surfaced only sporadically. For centuries the buried ship had occasionally triggered those dormant abilities, which explained the reports of poltergeists; people were unknowingly using their own telekinesis to move objects around, and the ghost sightings were traces of a racial memory. The authorities, and Breen in particular, find this explanation preposterous despite being shown the recording of Barbara's vision. They believe that the craft is a Nazi propaganda weapon and the alien bodies fakes designed to create exactly <b>the</b> <b>impressions</b> that Quatermass has succumbed to, and decide to hold a media event to stem the rumours that are already spreading.|$|E
5|$|In God Speaks, Meher Baba {{describes}} {{the journey of}} the soul from its original state of unconscious divinity to the ultimate attainment of conscious divinity. The whole journey is a journey of imagination, where the original indivisible state of God imagines becoming countless individualized souls which he likens to bubbles within an infinite ocean. Each soul, powered {{by the desire to}} become conscious, starts its journey in the most rudimentary form of consciousness. This limitation brings the need of a more developed form to advance it towards an increasingly conscious state. Consciousness grows in relation to <b>the</b> <b>impressions</b> each form is capable of gathering.|$|E

5|$|Some {{relatives}} of Compsognathus, namely Sinosauropteryx and Sinocalliopteryx, have been preserved with {{the remains of}} simple feathers covering the body like fur, promoting some scientists to suggest that Compsognathus might have been feathered in a similar way. Consequently, many depictions of Compsognathus show them with coverings of downy proto-feathers. However, no feathers or feather-like covering have been preserved with Compsognathus fossils, in contrast to Archaeopteryx, which {{are found in the}} same sediments. Karin Peyer, in 2006, reported skin impressions preserved {{on the side of the}} tail starting at the 13th tail vertebra. <b>The</b> <b>impressions</b> showed small bumpy tubercles, similar to the scales found on the tail and hind legs of Juravenator. Additional scales had in 1901 been reported by Von Huene, in the abdominal region of the German Compsognathus, but Ostrom subsequently disproved this interpretation; in 2012 they were by Achim Reisdorf seen as plaques of adipocere, corpse wax.|$|E
5|$|For Metal Gear Solid 4, Raiden's {{new design}} was a {{response}} to the criticism that only his face remained in his cybernetic body. Shinkawa, himself, was surprised by the way he came to illustrate Raiden. The staff noted that Raiden's debut in the Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer received notably positive responses; several video-game magazines promoted the game with Raiden's screenshots. Kojima echoed similar comments, indicating that he wanted to expand the character with another game. In designning him, Shinkawa wanted to convey both Raiden's beauty as well as sorrow in his cybernetic body. He was also made so that he could wield swords with his own legs giving the players <b>the</b> <b>impressions</b> he was a ninja. Raiden's first fight against Vamp in the game caused difficulty to motion and voice actors because of carefully planned movements performed by the two fighters. The staff was nevertheless satisfied with the outcome, considering it one of the best battles in the game. For the motion capture of Raiden, two actors were selected: one did most of his appearances while another did his action sequences.|$|E
5|$|The mandible, {{which is}} {{severely}} damaged and lacks the condyloid, coronoid, and angular processes {{at the back}} of the bone, contains the second and third molar and part of the lower incisor, but the first molar is missing. The capsular process of the lower incisor, a slight raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the incisor, is small. The preserved alveoli, <b>the</b> <b>impressions</b> left by the roots, show that the first molar was supported by large roots at the front and back and a smaller root in between these. The second molar is about square and shows the four main cusps commonly present in rodents: the protoconid, metaconid, hypoconid, and entoconid. A strongly developed mesolophid (a crest) is also present, as in most oryzomyines. The main valley between the cusps, the hypoflexid, is broad and V-shaped. The third molar is as long as the second, but it is narrower and the entoconid is poorly developed. Again, the hypoflexid is broad and V-shaped. The length of the toothrow at the alveoli is 8.7mm. The length of the second molar is 2.5mm and the width is 2.2mm. The third molar has a length of 2.5mm and width of 1.8mm.|$|E

60|$|The {{process of}} {{strengthening}} generic memories of succession, and, {{at the same}} time, intensifying expectations of succession, is what is commonly called verification. <b>The</b> <b>impression</b> B has frequently been observed to follow <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> A. <b>The</b> association thus produced is represented as the memory, A -> B. When <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> A appears again, the idea of B follows, associated {{with that of the}} immediate appearance of <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> B. If <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> B does appear, the expectation is said to be verified; while the memory A -> B is strengthened, and gives rise in turn to a stronger expectation. And repeated verification may render that expectation so strong that its non-verification is inconceivable.|$|R

30|$|Regarding implant angulation, {{the results}} of this study found that {{increasing}} implant angulation to 15 ° or 30 ° affected the accuracy of indirect impression technique. While in the direct unsplinted technique, no difference in accuracy was found between parallel condition and 15 ° angulated condition. The increased displacement of <b>impression</b> material and <b>the</b> difficult removal of <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> tray in case of angulated implant were believed to be the source of error in <b>the</b> indirect <b>impression</b> technique. In <b>the</b> direct technique, <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> coping remains in <b>the</b> <b>impression,</b> which reduces <b>the</b> effect of implant angulation and <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> material deformation upon removal from mouth.|$|R

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>impression</b> {{material}} {{used for}} this study was polyvinylsiloxane as it exhibits accuracy and adequate rigidity [23].

Therefore, <b>the</b> use of a more elastic consistency is advantageous in evaluating the effect of splinting impression copings on impression accuracy [19]. In addition, the single-step technique allows the material to record finer details without slumping of the material in the tray, less time-consuming, and simple to perform [24].|$|R
