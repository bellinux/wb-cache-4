5|$|Stuart Buck, a lawyer, also {{explored}} {{this issue}} in Acting White: The Ironic Legacy of Desegregation (2010). He said that segregated black schools had featured teachers, counselors, and others of the same race as the student population, and the adults often acted as mentors to the students. Integration of many public schools since the mid- to late-20th century may have resulted in schools in which black students perceived they were controlled or dominated by whites. A black student trying to achieve high educational success may then be considered as <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the minority group.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, the Soviet Union finally {{permitted}} free emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel. Prior to this, Jews <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the USSR faced persecution; {{those who}} succeeded arrived as refugees. Over {{the next few}} years some one million Soviet citizens migrated to Israel. Although there was concern that some of the new immigrants had only a very tenuous connection to Judaism, and many were accompanied by non-Jewish relatives, this massive wave of migration slowly transformed Israel, bringing large numbers of highly educated Soviet Jews and creating a powerful Russian culture in Israel.|$|E

25|$|On September 23, the Fleet Air Arm dropped {{propaganda}} leaflets on the city. Free French aircraft {{flew off}} from Ark Royal and landed at the airport, but the crews were taken prisoner. A boat {{with representatives of}} de Gaulle entered the port but were fired upon. At 10:00, Vichy French ships <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the port were given warning shots from Australia. The ships returned to port but the coastal forts opened fire on Australia. This led to an engagement between the battleships and cruisers and the forts. In the afternoon, Australia intercepted and fired on the Vichy destroyer Audacieux, setting it on fire and causing it to be beached.|$|E
25|$|Interstate 45 gained notoriety during Hurricane Rita in 2005.

Even though the Texas Department of Transportation started contraflow lane reversal at FM 1488, it did not alleviate the traffic jam deep into the city, as that starting point was even north of The Woodlands, which is close to Conroe, the northern terminus of the greater Houston area.|$|E
