5|$|In 1789, Antoine Lavoisier {{published}} {{a list of}} 33 chemical elements, grouping them into gases, metals, nonmetals, and earths. Chemists spent the following century searching for a more precise classification scheme. In 1829, Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner observed {{that many of the}} elements could be grouped into <b>triads</b> based on their chemical properties. Lithium, sodium, and potassium, for example, were grouped together in a triad as soft, reactive metals. Döbereiner also observed that, when arranged by atomic weight, the second member of each triad was roughly the average of the first and the third; this became known as the Law of <b>Triads.</b> German chemist Leopold Gmelin worked with this system, and by 1843 he had identified ten <b>triads,</b> three groups of four, and one group of five. Jean-Baptiste Dumas published work in 1857 describing relationships between various groups of metals. Although various chemists were able to identify relationships between small groups of elements, they had yet to build one scheme that encompassed them all.|$|E

Reluctant to hand the baby over, the two are forced to protect him from the <b>triads</b> who hired them in the first place.|$|E
5|$|Catalytic <b>triads</b> perform {{covalent}} catalysis using a residue as a nucleophile. The {{reactivity of}} the nucleophilic residue is increased by the functional {{groups of the}} other triad members. The nucleophile is polarised and oriented by the base, which is itself bound and stabilised by the acid.|$|E
40|$|The Dark <b>Triad</b> is {{composed}} of three related subclinical personality traits: narcissism (excessive self-love, need for attention), psychopathy (cold, remorseless), and Machiavellianism (manipulative, cynical). The present study uses Dark <b>Triad</b> film/television characters to examine how Dark <b>Triad</b> people view others like them. It was hypothesized that (1) participants higher in the Dark <b>Triad</b> {{are more interested in}} films/television shows with Dark <b>Triad</b> characters, (2) participants higher in the Dark <b>Triad</b> have a more positive reaction to Dark <b>Triad</b> characters, and (3) Dark <b>Triad</b> participants see themselves in Dark <b>Triad</b> characters. Gender differences in Dark <b>Triad</b> character evaluations were also examined. Participants were shown trailers for films/television shows, most of which featured a Dark <b>Triad</b> character, and asked questions about the films/shows and specific characters. Participants were given a questionnaire that assessed their Dark <b>Triad</b> characteristics. Results showed no significant relationship between Dark <b>Triad</b> scores and interest in films/shows with Dark <b>Triad</b> leads. However, participants higher in the Dark <b>Triad</b> viewed Dark <b>Triad</b> characters more positively than others. Also, Dark <b>Triad</b> participants saw themselves in Dark <b>Triad</b> characters. It was found that the ability of Dark <b>Triad</b> participants to see themselves in these characters mediated the relationship between participants’ Dark <b>Triad</b> scores and their reactions to Dark <b>Triad</b> characters. In conclusion, Dark <b>Triad</b> characters are generally disliked, but this does not affect liking of films/shows featuring them. However, people higher in the Dark <b>Triad</b> do like these characters more than others, likely because they see the characters as similar to themselves...|$|R
5000|$|The {{substitution}} {{of the major}} sixth for the perfect fifth above in the major <b>triad</b> and below in the minor <b>triad</b> results in the parallel of a given <b>triad.</b> In C major thence arises an apparent A minor <b>triad</b> (Tp, the parallel <b>triad</b> of the tonic, or tonic parallel), D minor <b>triad</b> (Sp), and E minor <b>triad</b> (Dp). Hugo Riemann ...|$|R
25|$|A {{more complex}} {{approach}} is sometimes used to name and denote augmented and diminished chords. An augmented <b>triad</b> {{can be viewed}} as a major <b>triad</b> in which the perfect fifth interval (spanning 7 semitones) has been substituted with an augmented fifth (8 semitones), and a diminished <b>triad</b> as a minor <b>triad</b> in which the perfect fifth has been substituted with a diminished fifth (6 semitones). In this case, the augmented <b>triad</b> can be named major <b>triad</b> sharp five, or major <b>triad</b> augmented fifth (M5, M+5, majaug5). Similarly, the diminished <b>triad</b> can be named minor <b>triad</b> flat five, or minor <b>triad</b> diminished fifth (m5, m°5, mindim5).|$|R
5|$|The enzymes trypsin and {{chymotrypsin}} {{were first}} purified in the 1930s. A serine {{in each of}} trypsin and chymotrypsin was identified as the catalytic nucleophile (by diisopropyl fluorophosphate modification) in the 1950s. The structure of chymotrypsin was solved by X-ray crystallography in the 1960s, showing {{the orientation of the}} catalytic triad in the active site. Other proteases were sequenced and aligned to reveal a family of related proteases, now called the S1 family. Simultaneously, the structures of the evolutionarily unrelated papain and subtilisin proteases were found to contain analogous <b>triads.</b> The 'charge-relay' mechanism for the activation of the nucleophile by the other triad members was proposed in the late 1960s. As more protease structures were solved by X-ray crystallography in the 1970s and 80s, homologous (such as TEV protease) and analogous (such as papain) <b>triads</b> were found. The MEROPS classification system in the 1990s and 2000s began classing proteases into structurally related enzyme superfamilies and so acts as a database of the convergent evolution of <b>triads</b> in over 20 superfamilies. Understanding how chemical constraints on evolution led to the convergence of so many enzyme families on the same triad geometries has developed in the 2010s. Of particular contention during the 1990s and early 2000s was the contribution of low-barrier hydrogen bonding to catalysis; however, current thinking is that ordinary hydrogen bonding is sufficient to explain the mechanism. The massive body of work on the charge-relay, covalent catalysis used by catalytic <b>triads</b> has led to the mechanism being the best characterised in all of biochemistry.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{divergent}} {{evolution of}} function (and even the triad's nucleophile), catalytic <b>triads</b> show {{some of the}} best examples of convergent evolution. Chemical constraints on catalysis have led to the same catalytic solution independently evolving in at least 23 separate superfamilies. Their mechanism of action is consequently one of the best studied in biochemistry.|$|E
5|$|Catalytic <b>triads</b> perform {{covalent}} catalysis via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. If this intermediate {{is resolved}} by water, {{the result is}} hydrolysis of the substrate. However, if the intermediate is resolved by attack by a second substrate, then the enzyme acts as a transferase. For example, attack by an acyl group results in an acyltransferase reaction. Several families of transferase enzymes have evolved from hydrolases by adaptation to exclude water and favour attack of a second substrate.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, the diminished <b>triad</b> {{in a minor}} scale occurs on the second scale degree; in the key of C minor, this is the D diminished <b>triad</b> (D, F, A). This <b>triad</b> is {{consequently}} called the supertonic diminished <b>triad.</b> Like the supertonic <b>triad</b> found in a major key, the supertonic diminished <b>triad</b> has a predominant function, almost always resolving to a dominant functioning chord.|$|R
40|$|Misunderstandings and misconceptions {{have arisen}} as the <b>Triad</b> {{approach}} has gained wider application. The <b>Triad</b> initiative’s ability to catalyze second-generation cleanup practices will be hampered if inaccurate or incomplete assumptions create persistent confusion about what <b>Triad</b> is {{or how it}} works. This article has been prepared by the multi-agency workgroup responsible for articulating the <b>Triad</b> approach and coordinating national <b>Triad</b> efforts. It serves to address some misunderstandings about key <b>Triad</b> concepts. As an aid to those wishing to learn more, a new Web site (the <b>Triad</b> Resource Center, [URL] and a new <b>Triad</b> reference document from the Interstate Technology and Regulatory Council (ITRC) are introduced as sources of explanatory information supporting the <b>Triad</b> approach...|$|R
50|$|The {{augmented}} <b>triad</b> {{differs from}} the other kinds of <b>triad</b> (the major <b>triad,</b> the minor <b>triad,</b> and the diminished <b>triad)</b> in {{that it does not}} naturally arise in a diatonic scale. Although it could be conceptualized as a <b>triad</b> built on the third degree of a harmonic minor scale or melodic minor scale, it virtually never occurs in this way (since any chord on the third degree is itself rare, usually being a new tonic).|$|R
5|$|The same triad {{geometries}} been converged upon by serine proteases {{such as the}} chymotrypsin and subtilisin superfamilies. Similar convergent {{evolution has}} occurred with cysteine proteases such as viral C3 protease and papain superfamilies. These <b>triads</b> have converged to almost the same arrangement due to the mechanistic similarities in cysteine and serine proteolysis mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|The {{sophistication of}} the active site network causes {{residues}} involved in catalysis (and residues in contact with these) to be highly evolutionarily conserved. However, there are examples of divergent evolution in catalytic <b>triads,</b> both in the reaction catalysed, and the residues used in catalysis. The triad remains {{the core of the}} active site, but it is evolutionarily adapted to serve different functions.|$|E
5|$|With no {{government}} enforcement from the Chinese or the British {{aside from a}} few raids by the Hong Kong Police, the Walled City became a haven for crime and drugs. It was only during a 1959 trial for a murder that occurred within the Walled City that the Hong Kong government was ruled to have jurisdiction there. By this time, however, the Walled City was virtually ruled by the organised crime syndicates known as <b>triads.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The leading-tone <b>triad</b> is used {{in several}} functions. Commonly, it {{is used as a}} passing chord between a root {{position}} tonic <b>triad</b> and a first inversion tonic <b>triad</b> [...] The leading-tone <b>triad</b> prolongs tonic through neighbor and passing motion in this instance.|$|R
50|$|A diminished <b>triad</b> {{occurs in}} a major scale only on the seventh scale degree; in the key of C, this is a B diminished <b>triad</b> (B, D, F). Since the <b>triad</b> is built on the seventh scale degree, it is also called the leading-tone <b>triad.</b> The leading-tone <b>triad</b> also occurs in the seventh chord built on the fifth degree; in C, this is G {{dominant}} seventh (G, B, D, F). For this reason, it has dominant function. Unlike the dominant <b>triad</b> or dominant seventh, the leading-tone <b>triad</b> functions as a prolongational chord rather than a structural chord since the strong root motion by fifth is now absent.|$|R

5|$|Enzymes {{that contain}} a {{catalytic}} triad {{use it for}} one of two reaction types: either to split a substrate (hydrolases) or to transfer one portion of a substrate over to a second substrate (transferases). <b>Triads</b> are an inter-dependent set of residues in the active site of an enzyme and act in concert with other residues (e.g. binding site and oxyanion hole) to achieve nucleophilic catalysis. These triad residues act together to make the nucleophile member highly reactive, generating a covalent intermediate with the substrate that is then resolved to complete catalysis.|$|E

The game reveals the story of Wei Shen (Will Yun Lee), a former San Francisco police officer who was transferred to the Hong Kong Police Force and assigned the task to infiltrate and destroy a Triad organization known as the Sun On Yee (based on the Sun Yee On). The main storyline features two sub-plots: Shen's balance between completing his police mission whilst committing crimes to prove himself to the <b>Triads,</b> and missions assigned by a Triad lieutenant, including assassination of Triad members loyal to other lieutenants.|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} studied triad is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif. Several {{families}} of cysteine proteases use this triad set, for example TEV protease and papain. The triad acts similarly to serine protease <b>triads,</b> {{with a few}} notable differences. Due to cysteine's low pKa, {{the importance of the}} Asp to catalysis varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. hepatitis A virus protease), whilst in others the cysteine is already deprotonated before catalysis begins (e.g. papain). This triad is also used by some amidases, such as N-glycanase to hydrolyse non-peptide C-N bonds.|$|E

40|$|TOPIC: The <b>triad</b> of {{impairment}} {{referred to}} at {{present in the}} autism-related literature is a behavioral <b>triad.</b> This paper extends this thinking of the <b>triad</b> of impairment to the <b>triad</b> that underlies the behavioral manifestation. The real <b>triad</b> of impairment. PURPOSE: This paper considers the thinking and information processing style of autism and takes the next transitional step in understanding the <b>triad</b> of impairment. SOURCES USED: Contemporary literature on autism and information processing. CONCLUSIONS: Exceptional pioneering work in the late 1970 s {{gave rise to the}} concept of the <b>triad</b> of impairments as the central plank of the construct of autism: impaired communication; impaired social skills; and a restricted and repetitive way of being-in-the-world. This clear articulation of the structures of the phenomena allowed a new way for professionals and families to see and understand autism, and to relate to those with autism. Like the evolution of many concepts, this was a transitional idea. The original <b>triad</b> of impairments described the behavioral manifestation; the actual <b>triad</b> of impairments is at the level of cognitive processing. The actual <b>triad</b> of impairment is static and ubiquitous unlike the variable and fluctuating behavioral manifestation. The actual <b>triad</b> of impairment in autism is visual as opposed to linguistic processing, impaired abstraction, and lack of theory of mind. The actual <b>triad</b> is central to all diagnosis that together makes up the autism spectrum...|$|R
5|$|Flowers {{are usually}} borne {{in groups of}} three—one female flower {{together}} with two male flowers. In some species groups of four flowers (two male and two female) have been reported. At {{the far end of}} the inflorescence, away from the axis of the tree, pairs of male flowers replace the <b>triads</b> of male and female flowers. Flower colour is poorly known. It must be recorded from live plants, since preserved flowers lose their colour over time, and records of these species in the wild are incomplete. Male flowers tend to fall into two groups—those with cream or yellow flowers and those with some amount of purple in the flowers. Female flowers are even less well known than male flowers.|$|E
5|$|Despite Singapore's growing importance, the {{administration}} governing {{the island was}} understaffed, ineffectual and unconcerned with {{the welfare of the}} populace. Administrators were usually posted from India and were unfamiliar with local culture and languages. While the population had quadrupled during 1830 to 1867, the size of the civil service in Singapore had remained unchanged. Most people had no access to public health services and diseases such as cholera and smallpox caused severe health problems, especially in overcrowded working-class areas. As a result of {{the administration}}'s ineffectiveness and the predominantly male, transient, and uneducated nature of the population, the society was lawless and chaotic. In 1850 there were only twelve police officers in the city of nearly 60,000 people. Prostitution, gambling, and drug abuse (particularly of opium) were widespread. Chinese criminal secret societies (analogous to modern-day <b>triads)</b> were extremely powerful, and some had tens of thousands of members. Turf wars between rival societies occasionally led to hundreds of deaths and attempts to suppress them had limited success.|$|E
5|$|Family {{relationships}} {{are a common}} type of connection between gods. Deities often form male and female pairs, reflecting the importance of procreation in Egyptian religious thought. Families of three deities, with a father, mother, and child, represent {{the creation of new}} life and the succession of the father by the child, a pattern that connects divine families with royal succession. Osiris, Isis, and Horus formed the quintessential family of this type. The pattern they set grew more widespread over time, so that many deities in local cult centers, like Ptah, Sekhmet, and their child Nefertum at Memphis and Amun, Mut, and Khonsu at Thebes, were assembled into family <b>triads.</b> Genealogical connections like these are changeable, in keeping with the multiple perspectives in Egyptian belief. Hathor, as a fertility goddess, could act as mother to any child god, including the child form of the sun god, although in other circumstances she was the sun god's daughter.|$|E

A significant {{preference for the}} letters of one's own name over {{those of the other}} person was found. The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: 1) either pairs or <b>triads</b> of letters; 2) encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred one(s); 3) the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; 4) own-name letters presented first or last. All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out. No significant difference was found using family name rather than first name or both names. While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent data analysis revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initial.|$|E

Thongs almost manages to escape with the baby, but is forced to surrender when the <b>triads</b> threaten to hurl Octopus to his death.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyena {{societies}} {{are more complex}} than those of other carnivorous mammals, and are remarkably {{similar to those of}} cercopithecine primates in respect to group size, structure, competition and cooperation. Like cercopithecine primates, spotted hyenas use multiple sensory modalities, recognise individual conspecifics, are conscious that some clan-mates may be more reliable than others, recognise third-party kin and rank relationships among clan-mates, and adaptively use this knowledge during social decision making. Also, like cercopithecine primates, dominance ranks in hyena {{societies are}} not correlated with size or aggression, but with ally networks. In this latter trait, the spotted hyena further show parallels with primates by acquiring rank through coalition. However, rank reversals and overthrows in spotted hyena clans are very rare. The social network dynamics of spotted hyenas are determined by multiple factors. Environmental factors include rainfall and prey abundance; individual factors include preference to bond with females and with kin; and topological effects include the tendency to close <b>triads</b> in the network. Female hyenas are more flexible than males in their social bonding preferences.|$|E
