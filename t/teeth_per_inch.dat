2500|$|A bandsaw (also written band saw) is a {{saw with}} a long, sharp blade {{consisting}} of a continuous band of toothed metal stretched between two or more wheels to cut material. They are used principally in woodworking, metalworking, and lumbering, but may cut a variety of materials. Advantages include uniform cutting action {{as a result of}} an evenly distributed tooth load, and the ability to cut irregular or curved shapes like a jigsaw. The minimum radius of a curve is determined by the width of the band and its kerf. [...] Most bandsaws have two wheels rotating in the same plane, one of which is powered, although some may have three or four to distribute the load. The blade itself can come in a variety of sizes and tooth pitches (<b>teeth</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> or TPI), which enables the machine to be highly versatile and able to cut a wide variety of materials including wood, metal and plastic.|$|E
5000|$|Compass saws have a narrow, tapered blade usually {{ending in}} a sharp point, {{typically}} with eight to ten <b>teeth</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> but up to twenty <b>teeth</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> for harder materials and as few as five <b>teeth</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> for softer materials. They have a curved, light [...] "pistol grip" [...] handle, designed for work in confined spaces and overhead.|$|E
5000|$|Points {{per inch}} (25 mm): The most common {{measurement}} of the frequency of teeth on a saw blade. It is taken by setting the tip (or point) of one tooth at the zero point on a ruler, and then {{counting the number of}} points between the zero mark and the one-inch mark, inclusive (that is, including both the point at the zero mark and any point that lines up precisely with the one-inch mark). There is always one more point per inch than there are <b>teeth</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (e.g., a saw with 14 points per inch will have 13 <b>teeth</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> and a saw with 10 points per inch will have 9 <b>teeth</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch).</b> Some saws {{do not have the same}} number of <b>teeth</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> throughout their entire length, but the vast majority do. Those with more <b>teeth</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> at the toe are described as having incremental teeth, in order to make starting the saw cut easier.|$|E
50|$|Ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> is very {{commonly}} used by weavers who must use {{the number of}} ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> in order to pick the right reed to weave with. The number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> varies on the pattern to be woven and {{the thickness of the}} thread. Plain weaves generally use half the number of warps <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> for the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> whereas denser weaves like a twill weave will use a higher ratio like two thirds of the number of warps <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> Finer threads require more threads <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> than thick ones, and thus result in a higher number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|R

50|$|A French flush-cut saw is a {{double-edged}} tool, {{similar to a}} veneer saw, that is designed for trimming the ends of dowels, tenons, and other protusions flush with a surface. The blade usually has 11 <b>teeth</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> on one side, and 20 <b>teeth</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> on the other side, making it more versatile than other flush-cutting saws. The blade is approximately 6 inches long, {{and in order to}} avoid marring the surface, the saw teeth are angled slightly upward.|$|E

50|$|Compared {{with other}} saws {{designed}} for cutting curves, such as coping or fretsaws, compass saws {{have a larger}} blade and fewer <b>teeth</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> This allows them to cut more quickly, and to cut through thicker materials, but leaves a rougher finish.|$|E
50|$|Handspinners use {{the number}} of twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> often. Because the amount of twist defines {{a lot about a}} yarn, {{the number of}} twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> is an {{important}} measure to recreate a yarn. As a spinner spins, they will often stop every few minutes to check to see that the number of twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> is the same throughout the yarn, as well as that the number of wraps <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (the thickness of the yarn) is the same. Measuring the number of twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> while spinning singles also helps the spinner create a balanced yarn when plying. Yarns that have relatively few twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> tend to have a softer hand but are not as strong as yarns with more twists <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> such as medium twist or hard twist yarns. Yarns that have a very hard twist, enough so that the yarn will double back onto itself when released from tension, are called crepe-twist yarns.|$|R

50|$|The {{number of}} ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> {{in a piece}} of woven cloth varies {{depending}} on the stage of manufacture. Before the cloth is woven, the warp has a certain number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> which {{is directly related to the}} size reed being used. After weaving the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> will increase, and it will increase again after being washed. This increase in the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (and picks <b>per</b> <b>inch)</b> and shrinkage in the size of the fabric is known as the take-up. The take-up is dependent on many factors, including the material and how tightly the cloth is woven. Tightly woven fabric shrinks more (and thus the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> increases more) than loosely woven fabric, as do more elastic yarns and fibers.|$|R
50|$|The {{veneer saw}} {{is a small}} {{double-edged}} tool for cutting thin hardwood veneer. Its narrow curved blade facilitates precision work, and its elevated offset handle {{makes it possible to}} cut flush with a surface. The blade is usually 3 or 4 inches long and it has 13 tpi (<b>teeth</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Dovetail saw [...] - [...] a small backsaw used to cut {{dovetail}}s. Although most {{dovetail saw}} teeth are set for cross-cutting, a rip saw tooth pattern is more efficient. These saws will {{usually have a}} higher number of <b>teeth</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (around 15 - 20 T.P.I.) with teeth sharpened to favor ripping operations and set to leave a narrow kerf.|$|E
5000|$|Tenon saw [...] - [...] a midsized backsaw. The saw derives {{its name}} from its use in the cutting of tenons for mortise and tenon joinery. Tenon saws are {{commonly}} available with rip-filed teeth for rip cutting and cross-cut for cutting across the grain. Teeth are relatively fine, with 13 <b>teeth</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> being a common size for the saw.|$|E

While open-cell foams typically have R-values of 3 to 4 <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (RSI-0.53 to RSI-0.70 <b>per</b> <b>inch),</b> closed-cell foams can attain R-values of 5 to 8 <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (RSI-0.88 to RSI-1.41 <b>per</b> <b>inch).</b> This is important if space is limited, {{because it allows}} a thinner layer of insulation to be used. For example, a 1-inch layer of closed-cell foam provides about the same insulation factor as 2 inches of open-cell foam.|$|R

50|$|A plywood saw is a {{saw that}} has a fine-toothed blade that {{minimizes}} tearing of the outer plies of a sheet of plywood. An extra set of teeth on the curved upper edge of the blade allows starting of a cut {{on the inside of}} a panel (away from the edge) without having to drill a starting hole. The standard plywood saw blade is 11 inches long and has 14 tpi (<b>teeth</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Compared {{with the}} coping saw it has much {{shallower}} blades, {{which are usually}} extra-fine, up to 32 <b>teeth</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (tpi). This allows much tighter curves to be cut‚Äîwith many blades even sharp corners are possible‚Äîbut the blades are also much more fragile {{compared with that of}} a coping saw. Unlike the coping saw, the blade has a fixed orientation in relation to the frame. This means that the fretsaw is less useful when cutting long narrow components, but the increased depth of the frame does allow access much further {{from the edge of the}} board.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pitch of}} the teeth can be {{anywhere}} from fourteen to thirty-two <b>teeth</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (tpi) for a hand blade, with as few as three tpi for a large power hacksaw blade. The blade chosen {{is based on the}} thickness of the material being cut, with a minimum of three teeth in the material. As hacksaw teeth are so small, they are set in a [...] "wave" [...] set. As for other saws they are set from side to side to provide a [...] or clearance when sawing, but the set of a hacksaw changes gradually from tooth to tooth in a smooth curve, rather than alternate teeth set left and right.|$|E

50|$|Plates can be {{mechanically}} roughened; {{one way is}} to rub fine {{metal filings}} over the surface with a piece of glass; the finer the filings, the smaller the grain of the surface. Special roughening tools called 'rockers' have been in use since at least the eighteenth century. The method commonly in use today is to use a steel rocker approximately five inches wide, which has between 45 and 120 <b>teeth</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> on the face of a blade {{in the shape of a}} shallow arc, with a wooden handle projecting upwards in a T-shape. Rocked steadily from side to side at the correct angle, the rocker will proceed forward creating burrs in the surface of the copper. The plate is then moved - either rotated by a set number of degrees or through 90 degrees according to preference - and then rocked in another pass. This is repeated until the plate is roughened evenly and will print a completely solid tone of black.|$|E
