5|$|The {{season was}} {{affected}} by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which began on November 5, 2007 and ended on February 12, 2008. The season's show runners Tina Fey and Robert Carlock publicly committed to honor the strike <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> not ask their writers to do otherwise. As a result, only 15 episodes of the 22 episodes ordered could be produced.|$|E
5|$|At {{the final}} {{meeting of the}} World Motorsports Commission in December 2011, a series of {{amendments}} to the sporting regulations were published. Chief among these is the re-introduction of a rule that will allow all lapped traffic under the safety car (which remained the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG introduced in 2010) {{to be released from}} the queue before the car returns to pit lane, allowing the drivers to unlap <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> ensure a clean restart.|$|E

5|$|The Sonderkommado were housed {{separately}} from other prisoners, in somewhat better conditions. Their {{quality of life}} was further improved by access to the goods taken from murdered prisoners, which Sonderkommandos were sometimes able to steal for <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> trade on Auschwitz's black market. Hungarian doctor Miklós Nyiszli reported that the Sonderkommando numbered around 860 prisoners when the Hungarian Jews were being killed in 1944. Many Sonderkommandos committed suicide due to the horrors of their work; {{those who did not}} generally were shot by the SS in a matter of weeks, and new Sonderkommando units were then formed from incoming transports. Almost none of the 2,000 prisoners placed in these units survived to the camp's liberation.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, two {{independent}} efforts have elucidated the molecular {{architecture of the}} 26S proteasome by single particle electron microscopy. More recently, a pseudo-atomic atomic model has been built, again using cryo-EM. In {{the heart of the}} 19S, directly adjacent to the 20S, are the AAA-ATPases (AAA proteins) that assemble to a heterohexameric ring of the order Rpt1/Rpt2/Rpt6/Rpt3/Rpt4/Rpt5. This ring is a trimer of dimers: Rpt1/Rpt2, Rpt6/Rpt3, and Rpt4/Rpt5 dimerize via their N-terminal coiled-coils. These coiled-coils protrude from the hexameric ring. The largest regulatory particle non-ATPases Rpn1 and Rpn2 bind to the tips of Rpt1/2 and Rpt6/3, respectively. The ubiquitin receptor Rpn13 binds to Rpn2 and completes the base cub-complex. The lid covers one half of the AAA-ATPase hexamer (Rpt6/Rpt3/Rpt4) and, unexpectedly, directly contacts the 20S via Rpn6 and to lesser extent Rpn5. The subunits Rpn9, Rpn5, Rpn6, Rpn7, Rpn3, and Rpn12, which are structurally related among <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> subunits of the COP9 complex and eIF3 (hence called PCI subunits) assemble to a horseshoe-like structure enclosing the Rpn8/Rpn11 heterodimer. Rpn11, the deubiquinating enzyme, is placed {{at the mouth of the}} AAA-ATPase hexamer, ideally positioned to remove ubiquitin moieties immediately before translocation of substrates into the 20S. The second ubiquitin receptor identified to date, Rpn10, is positioned at the periphery of the lid, near subunits Rpn8 and Rpn9.|$|E
5|$|PBHistory {{documents}} {{were used by}} the officials of various governments. US ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge made use of 21 documents in a speech he made at the United Nations. Information was also funneled to US ambassadors and Congresspeople. The US Congress in 1954 was among the few Republican controlled Congresses in many years. Republicans thus sought to use an anti-communist push to generate support for <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> erode the voting base of the Democratic party. Anti-Communist members of the US Congress, such as Charles J. Kersten and Patrick J. Hillings of the Kersten Committee, enthusiastically involved themselves with PBHistory. By August 1954, Kersten was receiving PBHistory documents from Dulles so he could use them in speeches to Congress about the Soviet Union's influence in Guatemala. In September and October 1954, the Kersten Committee held a number of hearings, purportedly investigating the penetration of communist influence. PBHistory {{documents were}} used in this process, and Carlos Castillo Armas became the first head of state to testify before a US Congress committee (although he did so {{through the use of}} a tape recording of his testimony). Although the hearings did little to unearth information about communist presence in Guatemala, they did provide Operation PBHistory with huge publicity within the US.|$|E

In texts of Jewish law such as the Mishnah and Gemara, the term יהודי (Yehudi), meaning Jew, is rarely used, and instead the ethnonym ישראלי (Yisraeli), or Israelite, is widely used to refer to Jews.

25|$|In {{the middle}} of the 16th century, a doctor from Verona named Girolamo Fracastoro was the first to propose a theory that these very small, unseeable, {{particles}} that cause disease were alive. They were considered to be able to spread by air, multiply by <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> be destroyable by fire. In this way he refuted Galen's miasma theory (poison gas in sick people). In 1543 he wrote a book De contagione et contagiosis morbis, in which {{he was the first to}} promote personal and environmental hygiene to prevent disease. The development of a sufficiently powerful microscope by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1675 provided visual evidence of living particles consistent with a germ theory of disease.|$|E
25|$|The Kappa League {{was founded}} Thursday, February 12, 1970 by the Los Angeles (CA) Alumni chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi; under the {{direction}} of Leon W Steward. Steward brought the idea to Los Angeles from Dayton, Ohio, where he had worked closely with Jay Crosby to expand the guide right activities of Dayton (OH) Alumni chapter. The Kappa League is a series of activities designed to help young high school male students develop their leadership talents. The activities provide both challenging and rewarding experiences to enhance their lives. The goal of the League is to help the students achieve worthy goals for <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> make meaningful contributions to their communities. The League includes a series of workshops to achieve its goals.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} February, the Japanese {{controlled}} most of Dutch Timor and {{the area}} around Dili in the northeast. However, the Australians remained {{in the south and}} east of the island. The 2/2nd Independent Company was specially trained for commando-style, stay behind operations and it had its own engineers and signallers, although it lacked heavy weapons and vehicles. The commandos were hidden throughout the mountains of Portuguese Timor, and they commenced raids against the Japanese, assisted by Timorese guides, native carriers and mountain ponies. Although Portuguese officials—under Governor Manuel de Abreu Ferreira de Carvalho—remained officially neutral and in charge of civil affairs, both the Portuguese and the indigenous East Timorese were usually sympathetic to the Allies, who were able to use the local telephone system to communicate among <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> gather intelligence on Japanese movements. However, the Allies initially did not have functioning radio equipment and were unable to contact Australia to inform them of their continued resistance.|$|E

25|$|Instead {{she argues}} for an ethics based {{precisely}} on {{the limits of}} self-knowledge as the limits of responsibility itself. Any concept of responsibility which demands the full transparency of the self to itself, an entirely accountable self, necessarily does violence to the opacity which marks {{the constitution of the}} self it addresses. The scene of address by which responsibility is enabled is always already a relation between subjects who are variably opaque to <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> each other. The ethics that Butler envisions is therefore one in which the responsible self knows the limits of its knowing, recognizes the limits of its capacity to give an account of itself to others, and respects those limits as symptomatically human. To take seriously one's opacity to oneself in ethical deliberation means then to critically interrogate the social world in which one comes to be human {{in the first place and}} which remains precisely that which one cannot know about oneself. In this way, Butler locates social and political critique at the core of ethical practice.|$|E

Functional theories of grammar explain grammatical structures by their communicative functions, and understand the grammatical structures of language {{to be the result of}} an adaptive process by which grammar was [...] "tailored" [...] to serve the communicative needs of its users.|$|E
