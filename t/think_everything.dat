This was also the case for [...] "kosmische Musik" [...] ("cosmic music"), a {{marketing}} name invented by record producer Rolf-Ulrich Kaiser for krautrock bands like Ash Ra Tempel, Tangerine Dream, and Klaus Schulze. Musicologist Julian Cope, in his book Krautrocksampler, says [...] "Krautrock is a subjective British phenomenon," [...] based {{on the way the}} music was received in the UK rather than on the actual West German music scene out of which it grew. For instance, while one of the main groups originally tagged as krautrock, Faust, recorded a seminal 12-minute track they titled [...] "Krautrock", they would later distance themselves from the term, saying: [...] "When the English people started talking about Krautrock, we thought they were just taking the piss... and when you hear the so-called 'Krautrock renaissance,' it makes me <b>think</b> <b>everything</b> we did was for nothing." [...] West German's music press initially used [...] "krautrock" [...] as a pejorative, but the term lost its stigma after the music gained success in Britain.|$|E
