5|$|The IDF command {{did not see}} {{the forces}} in the western Negev as {{sufficient}} to fully stop an Egyptian invasion, wherever it was headed, and ordered an operation to stop or delay the advancing column. The command also feared that the Arab forces would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> facts on the ground before the impending UN-imposed ceasefire. The two Arab forces that were considered a threat were the Iraqis in the Triangle (Jenin–Nablus–Tulkarm) and the Egyptians at Majdal–Isdud. Thus, Golani and Carmeli were to attack Jenin, Alexandroni was to harass Tulkarm, and Givati was to attack Isdud.|$|E
5|$|A Nightmare on Elm Street was {{originally}} {{going to follow}} the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, Friday the 13th, with the writers taking what they thought were the best elements {{from each of the}} films and creating a single storyline with them. Eventually, they decided to use Craven's original storyline, and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a scarier film. That being, they decided to remove the one-line quipping Freddy, who had become less scary and more comical over the years, and bring him back to a darker nature; this included developing the character as a true child molester, something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a child killer instead.|$|E

5|$|In 202 BC, Rhodes and her allies Pergamum, Cyzicus, and Byzantium {{combined}} their fleets {{and defeated}} Philip at the Battle of Chios. Just {{a few months}} later, Philip's fleet defeated the Rhodians at Lade. While Philip was plundering Pergamese territory and attacking cities in Caria, Attalus I of Pergamum went to Athens to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a diversion. He succeeded in securing an alliance with the Athenians, who immediately declared war on the Macedonians. The King of Macedon could not remain inactive; he assailed Athens with his navy and with some infantry. The Romans warned him, however, to withdraw or face war with Rome. After suffering a defeat {{at the hands of}} the Rhodian and Pergamese fleets, Philip withdrew, but not before attacking the city of Abydos on the Hellespont. Abydos fell after a long siege and most of its inhabitants committed suicide. Philip rejected the Roman ultimatum to stop attacking Greek states and the Romans declared war on Macedon. This left the Cretan cities with no major allies, and the largest city of Crete, Knossos, joined the Rhodians. Faced with this combination, both Hierapytna and Olous surrendered and were forced to sign a treaty favourable to Rhodes and Knossos.|$|E
5|$|Throughout this, Idelba {{has been}} {{secretly}} working on atomic physics {{and she and}} her fellow researchers have made some disturbing discoveries. They conclude that {{it would be possible to}} make a devastating weapon from nuclear chain reactions and fear that the military will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> such bombs and restart the war. In order to prevent this, Idelba tries desperately to hide all evidence about her research and contacts concerned scientists in other parts of the world. The government learns of her work however and raids the Zawiyya to get hold of her papers, but Budur manages to hide them. Idelba eventually dies of radiation poisoning from the materials she was working with and leaves all her research to Budur, who keeps her secret and eventually manages to organize an international conference of scientists to discuss the nuclear issue. The meeting is held in Isfahan in Iran (one of the few Islamic nations which has prospered since the war) and scientists from all over the world attend. They agree that none of them will work on the creation of nuclear weapons for their respective countries, no matter what pressure they are put under by their governments and also start a new international scientific movement to break down barriers between cultures in a spirit of reconciliation and friendship (they even create a new scientific calendar to be used by the whole world, with its year zero set from the time of the conference).|$|E

He tried to define a system that used the numbers 1–6 to represent father, mother, son, daughter, husband and wife, and that reduced all other kinship terms to these basic terms.|$|E

Yellowjacket briefly betrays the team to Immortus and the powerful Time-Keepers <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a timeline where he will not turn back into Pym, but he rejects this decision in time to help his allies. Observing the final battle, Libra - who brought the team together by using the Destiny Force to tap into his subconscious awareness of the cosmic balance - reflects that both Pyms were necessary so that Yellowjacket's betrayal could bring the team into the right position to attack the Time-Keepers, while Pym's presence as Giant-Man both provided a stable support and irritated Yellowjacket to provoke his own actions.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{revolves}} around Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) noticing {{a man named}} Jeff (Paul Rae) in the emergency room, whom he thinks is [...] "too nice".

Meanwhile, Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps), thinks the other diagnostic team members don't respect him, while Amber Volakis (Anne Dudek) and House <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a deal in which they can both spend time with Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard).|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{the musical}} {{arrangements}}, Lafourcade explained, [...] "I {{felt that the}} arrangements had to function as the perfect embrace to the songs... since each song had its own distinct personality.

Kind of like creating photographs through music". She stated to Venue Magazine that the album sequence was selected to create a cycle, to have a beginning and an ending.

Podeswa stated, [...] "The idea is there's an indefinite indeterminate quality that she could be ancient. We were limited by choosing to use a real person rather than a complete [...] creation. Because what does a 400-year-old person look like? We don't know. So if you <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> that, then you're creating something that looks beyond our known reality. Here you feel like she's very old without putting a number on it." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2014, David Cage {{discussed}} {{the future of}} video games and referred to the generally negative reviews Beyond received from hardcore gamers. [...] "There will always be games for the hardcore gamers who see games as a skill-based sport, or {{as a way to}} compete with their friends", he said. He also referred to casual gamers who play games [...] "as a mere hobby, like many titles for smartphones". He then stated, [...] "We try to develop a middle way, with games that try to tell a story, to carry meaning, and where violence isn't the core activity. Most of all, we <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> an emotion, to make players live something strong and unique, which remains an ambitious challenge in a video game." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the other}} line 8...f6 Black {{does not want}} to decentralise his queen and prefers to {{concentrate}} on active piece play in the centre. After 9.exf6 Nxf6, 10.Qd1, 10.Qd2 and 10.Qd3 are all possible, but each has its drawbacks: on d1 the queen is not developed, on d3 it is exposed to Bc8–f5 and on d2 it is exposed to Nf6–e4. Lalic considers 10.Qd3 to be the main move, qualifies 10.Qd1 as a [...] "respectable option", but considers 10.Qd2 as [...] "inaccurate". Meanwhile, Black will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> counterplay by attacking either the weak c4-pawn, or the kingside with g7–g5 and h7–h5. In both cases a key possibility is the move Nf6–e4 that centralises the knight, attacks the weak c3-pawn, controls the c5-square and supports the g7–g5 thrust.|$|E

500|$|... "Goodbye, Toby" [...] was {{generally}} well-received by critics. TV Squad's Jay Black said that [...] "The Office {{is at its}} best when its exposing the dramas that take [...] place at every workplace".

Kelly West of Cinemablend.com wrote that even though the episode did not play-out [...] "the way [...] expected", she was [...] "definitely not complaining". Alan Sepinwall, a writer for The Star-Ledger, was critical of the proposal scenario, saying that [...] "I really, really, really hope the writers aren't going to be foolish enough to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> real strife in the PB (Pam Beesly and Jim) relationship over how long it's going to take Jim to propose."

500|$|Bush {{was fond}} of saying that [...] "if he made any {{important}} contribution {{to the war effort}} at all, it would be to get the Army and Navy to tell each other what they were doing." [...] He established a cordial relationship with Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, and Stimson's assistant, Harvey H. Bundy, who found Bush [...] "impatient" [...] and [...] "vain", but said he was [...] "one of the most important, able men I ever knew". Bush's relationship with the navy was more turbulent. Bowen, the director of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), saw the NDRC as a bureaucratic rival, and recommended abolishing it. A series of bureaucratic battles ended with the NRL placed under the Bureau of Ships, and Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox placing an unsatisfactory fitness report in Bowen's personnel file. After the war, Bowen would again <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a rival to the NDRC inside the navy.|$|E
500|$|During script development, {{the crew}} spent {{four to five}} months {{scouting}} locations, creating a [...] "constant {{going back and forth}} between script and location". The film was shot entirely on location within England on an 11-week schedule during the 2004 summer. Co-producer Paul Webster noted that [...] "it is quite unusual for a movie this size to be shot entirely on location. Part of Joe 's idea was to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a reality which allows the actors to relax and feel at one with their environment." [...] Working under production designer Sarah Greenwood and set decorator Katie Spencer, the crew filmed on seven estates in six different counties. Because [...] "nothing exists in the United Kingdom that is untouched by the twenty-first century", many of the sites required substantial work to make them suitable for filming. Visual effects company Double Negative digitally restored several locations to make them contemporaneous; they eradicated weeds, enhanced gold plating on window frames, and removed anachronisms such as gravel driveways and electricity pylons. Double Negative also developed the typeface used for the film's title sequence.|$|E
