Yankovic explained that, [...] "if there’s a song that I think is really ripe for parody but I just can’t think of a clever enough idea, sometimes it’ll {{end up in the}} polka medley." [...] Regarding their popularity, Yankovic has said, [...] "At this point, it's sort of mandatory for me to do a polka medley.

500|$|Producer Paul Rabwin was displeased {{with the}} final episode, noting, [...] "'Badlaa' was the one episode I {{did not like the}} most [...] I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had done it different, I would have had John Shiban change the method of transportation.

500|$|... "Feeling This" [...] was {{the first}} track that was {{recorded}} for Blink-182 in early 2003. On {{the first day of}} pre-production on the album, bassist Mark Hoppus asked an engineer to explain Pro Tools to him, as it {{was the first}} time the band would record their music digitally. He began recording guitar and bass parts and experimenting with the software. When guitarist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker arrived, they too began adding new tracks to the project. The song was written in one day. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> sit there and try to analyze everything, what would be cool here or there, I just feel like I get so far away from what I would do, and I think your gut instinct is usually the best thing," [...] said Barker at the time.|$|E
500|$|French {{director}} Jean-Baptiste Mondino {{was selected}} by Bowie to direct an accompanying music video. Regarding this, Bowie said, [...] "It's an experiment; I'm really putting myself in his [...] hands. [...] I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did it , {{it would be very}} abrasive, and I'm not quite sure if that's how I want the song to come off visually. In concert it will be abrasive; it won't have the same quality as the video. But I really think Mondino is a fantastic video maker. He just knows that this is his genre. He's like a craftsman and that's what he's trying to perfect, this craft of making his five minutes work." [...] Actor Joe Dallesandro makes appearances throughout the clip, announcing the dance marathon. A shot from the music video was used to commercialize 7" [...] releases of the single.|$|E

500|$|Lytle {{also noted}} that he was likely to record a new Grandaddy album, stating, [...] "It's {{probably}} going to happen....

[...] In early 2013, Lytle elaborated: [...] "I love the idea of making another Grandaddy record, but I wouldn't want it hanging over my head like 'Okay, you made this record, now are you guys going {{to get out there and}} tour in support of it?'... I'm hoping for this dream scenario where I can make Grandaddy records every so often and not have all this messy stuff that goes along with it.

[...] Diepenbrock stated, [...] "If [...] was African American or Caucasian, {{it might have been}} a different deal"; he did not think Lin's race affected his recruiting until later seeing 10 Division I coaches express interest in a black student who Diepenbrock assessed as [...] "a nice junior college player". Lin said: [...] "I'm not saying top-5 state automatically gets you offers, but I do think [...] did affect the way coaches recruited me. I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were a different race, I would've been treated differently." [...] Walters added, [...] "People who don't think stereotypes exist are crazy. If [...] white, he's either a good shooter or heady. If he's Asian, he's good at math. We're not taking him." [...] During Lin's college career, fewer than 0.5% of men's Division 1 basketball players were Asian-American.|$|E
500|$|The glass cage might imply {{a vacuum}} that the figure's voice {{is unable to}} escape; {{as if it is}} {{screaming}} in silence. Rueful later in life, Bacon said that he had [...] "wanted to paint the scream more than the horror. I <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had really thought about what causes somebody to really scream, it would have made the scream... more successful". The work evokes memories of the Second World War. The glass enclosure of his 1949 Chicago Study for a Portrait is often seen as prophesying photographs of Adolf Eichmann's 1961 trial before a Jerusalem District Court, when he was held within a similar cage. Bacon strongly resisted literal comparisons though, and stated that he used the device so he could frame and [...] "really see the image—for no other reason. I know it's been interpreted as being many other things." [...] Other critics saw similarities between the glass case and the radio booths of late 1930s broadcasters who warned against the impending calamity. Denis Farr notes that Bacon was sympathetic to George Orwell and referred in interviews to Orwellian [...] "shouting voices... and trembling hands... convey the harsh atmosphere of an interrogation." ...|$|E

500|$|As a {{child he}} [...] "hoped to be a {{musician}} or a hockey player." [...] At Main Street Elementary School, with {{the encouragement of}} his teacher James Doyle, he developed an interest in writing, serving as editor for his school newspaper. He graduated from West Springfield High School in 1974, having been voted [...] "Most Likely Not to Live Up to Potential" [...] by his classmates, and dropped out of Holyoke Community College after one day, undecided about {{what he wanted to}} do with his life. He took up work in the clothing department at Steiger's department store, as a janitor at the Baystate Medical Center and also as a driving instructor. He commented: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had actually succeeded at college and gotten a degree in accounting or something, I might have given up too quickly on writing. Having no marketable job skills was a tremendous incentive to keep trying to succeed as a writer." [...] He realized [...] "there probably wasn't going to be a career in riding around with my friends listening to Foghat," [...] so Scully decided he [...] "definitely wanted to break into comedy" [...] even though he [...] "really had no reason to believe [...] could succeed." [...] Regardless, he moved to Los Angeles, California in 1982.|$|E
500|$|The {{accepted}} cover, {{designed by}} Aimee Macauley, features {{a photo of}} Nas as a child superimposed over a backdrop of a New York city block, taken by Danny Clinch. In a 1994 interview, Nas discussed the concept behind the photo of him at age 7, stating [...] "That was the year I started to acknowledge everything [...] That's the year everything set off. That's the year I started seeing the future for myself and doing what was right. The ghetto makes you think. The world is ours. I used to think I couldn't leave my projects. I used to <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> left, if anything happened to me, I {{thought it would be}} no justice or I would be just a dead slave or something. The projects used to be my world until I educated myself to see there's more out there." [...] As yet, Nas has not pointed to any outside influence for the artwork of his album cover. Yet according to Ego Trip, the cover of Illmatic is [...] "reputedly" [...] believed to have been inspired by a jazz album, Howard Hanger Trio's A Child Is Born (1974) [...] whose cover also features a photograph of a child, superimposed on an urban landscape.|$|E
500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to my chest. But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was dragging his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of them really, really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E

Harrison said the BBC {{offered him a}} new contract with which he would be financially [...] "made for life" [...] but {{he would no longer}} be a promoter.

Years later, the Duchess lamented her failure to have more children: [...] "The only real heavenly moment is the birth of the child. This cannot be compared to anything else. I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had even a dozen children I would have kept the same feeling." [...] In July 1884, they traveled to Ilinskoe, outside Moscow, to visit Maria’s younger brother Grand Duke Sergei, who had married Queen Victoria’s granddaughter Elisabeth of Hesse.|$|E

2500|$|In Gillette's rented room, {{authorities}} confiscated Brown's {{love letters}} to Gillette as evidence. District attorney George Ward read the letters aloud {{to the court}} during the trial {{in the fall of}} 1906, and Brown's letters gave the trial national attention. Brown pleaded with Gillette in the letters to accept responsibility for her condition, the pregnancy. In her final letter, written July 5, Brown looked forward to her impending Adirondack trip with Gillette, and she said farewell to her childhood home of South Otselic, wishing she could confess her pregnancy to her mother: [...] "I know I shall never see any of them again. And mamma! Great heavens, how I do love Mamma! I don't know what I shall do without her (...) Sometimes I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could tell mamma, but I can't. She has trouble enough as it is, and I couldn't break her heart like that. If I come back dead, perhaps if she does not know, she won't be angry with me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1943, Richard James, a naval {{mechanical}} engineer {{stationed at the}} William Cramp and Sons shipyards in Philadelphia, was developing springs that could support and stabilize sensitive instruments aboard ships in rough seas. James accidentally knocked one of the springs from a shelf, {{and watched as the}} spring [...] "stepped" [...] in a series of arcs to a stack of books, to a tabletop, and to the floor, where it re-coiled itself and stood upright. James's wife Betty later recalled, [...] "He came home and said, 'I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> got the right property of steel and the right tension; I could make it walk.'" [...] James experimented with different types of steel wire over the next year, and finally found a spring that would walk. [...] Betty was dubious at first, but changed her mind after the toy was fine-tuned and neighborhood children expressed an excited interest in it. She dubbed the toy Slinky (meaning [...] "sleek and graceful"), after finding the word in a dictionary, and deciding that the word aptly described the sound of a metal spring expanding and collapsing.|$|E
