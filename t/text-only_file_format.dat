40|$|Much digital {{preservation}} {{research has been}} built {{on the assumption that}} <b>file</b> <b>format</b> obsolescence poses a great risk to the continued access of digital content. In efforts to address this, a number of researchers created lists of factors {{that could be used to}} assess risks associated with digital <b>file</b> <b>formats.</b> This research examines these assumptions about <b>file</b> <b>format</b> obsolescence and <b>file</b> <b>format</b> evaluation factors with the aim of creating a simplified <b>file</b> <b>format</b> endangerment index. This study examines <b>file</b> <b>format</b> risk under a new lens of <b>file</b> <b>format</b> endangerment. Using the Delphi method in two separate studies, this exploratory research collected expert opinion on relevance of a list of factors as causal indicators of <b>file</b> <b>format</b> endangerment. The findings show that only three of the dozens of <b>file</b> <b>format</b> evaluation factors discussed in the literature exceeded an emergent threshold level as causes of <b>file</b> <b>format</b> endangerment: rendering software available, specifications available, and community/ 3 rd party support. These factors are ideal candidates for use in a <b>file</b> <b>format</b> endangerment index...|$|R
5000|$|ISO base media <b>file</b> <b>format</b> is {{directly}} based on Apple’s QuickTime container format. It {{was developed by}} MPEG (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11). The first MP4 <b>file</b> <b>format</b> specification was created {{on the basis of}} the QuickTime format specification published in 2001. The MP4 <b>file</b> <b>format</b> known as [...] "version 1" [...] was published in 2001 as ISO/IEC 14496-1:2001, as revision of the MPEG-4 Part 1: Systems. In 2003, the first version of MP4 <b>file</b> <b>format</b> was revised and replaced by MPEG-4 Part 14: MP4 <b>file</b> <b>format</b> (ISO/IEC 14496-14:2003), commonly known as MPEG-4 <b>file</b> <b>format</b> [...] "version 2". The MP4 <b>file</b> <b>format</b> was generalized into the ISO Base Media <b>File</b> <b>format</b> (ISO/IEC 14496-12:2004 or ISO/IEC 15444-12:2004), which defines a general structure for time-based media files.

In 2003, the first version of the MP4 <b>file</b> <b>format</b> was revised and replaced by MPEG-4 Part 14: MP4 <b>file</b> <b>format</b> (ISO/IEC 14496-14:2003), commonly named as MPEG-4 <b>file</b> <b>format</b> version 2.

5000|$|Support {{for video}} in SWF <b>file</b> <b>format</b> was added in Flash Player 6, {{released}} in 2002. In 2003, Flash Player 7 added direct support for FLV <b>file</b> <b>format.</b> Because of restrictions in the FLV <b>file</b> <b>format,</b> Adobe Systems has created in 2007 new <b>file</b> <b>formats</b> listed below, {{based on the}} ISO base media <b>file</b> <b>format</b> (MPEG-4 Part 12). Flash Player does not check {{the extension of the}} file, but rather looks inside the file to detect which format it is. The new <b>file</b> <b>formats</b> are completely different from the older FLV <b>file</b> <b>format.</b> For example, F4V does not support Screen video, Sorenson Spark, VP6 video compression formats and ADPCM, Nellymoser audio compression formats. Authors of Flash Player strongly encourage everyone to embrace the new standard <b>file</b> <b>format</b> F4V (ISO base media <b>file</b> <b>format).</b> There are functional limits with the FLV structure when streaming H.264 or AAC which could not be overcome without a redesign of the <b>file</b> <b>format.</b> This is one reason why Adobe Systems is moving away from the traditional FLV <b>file</b> structure. Initial <b>format</b> since 2002 is Flash Video, file suffix is [...]flv with a MIME derived Internet media type of video/x-flv.|$|R

For the storage of MPEG-4 media (AAC audio, MPEG-4 Part 2 video, MPEG-4 Part 10 - H.264/AVC) in 3G2 files, the 3G2 specification refers to the MP4 <b>file</b> <b>format</b> and the AVC <b>file</b> <b>format</b> specification, which described usage of this content in the ISO base media <b>file</b> <b>format.</b> For the storage of H.263 and AMR content 3G2 specification refers to the 3GP <b>file</b> <b>format</b> specification.|$|R
