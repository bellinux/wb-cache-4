50|$|Related {{to these}} findings, those husbands who {{reported}} the highest ratings of global marital satisfaction showed the highest ratings in daily intimacy. Similarly, the wives who rated their global satisfaction highest also had {{higher levels of}} daily intimacy.

Further, couples {{with high levels of}} demand-withdraw communication rated their average daily intimacy as much lower. This suggests a relationship between one's overall marital satisfaction and the amount of intimacy in a relationship, though no causation can be proven with <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>research.</b> Self-esteem has also been found to be a predictor of satisfaction, with couples exhibiting both high self-esteem and high self-disclosure levels being the most satisfied in their relationships.|$|E
