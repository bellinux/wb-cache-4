5|$|By that time, {{the land}} once held in common by the Székely {{community}} had gradually become divided into {{smaller and smaller}} units; thus {{a vast number of}} the free warrior-peasants had to enter the service of their more prosperous fellow Székelys. <b>This</b> <b>social</b> stratification was formally recognized by a royal decree in 1473. Thereafter those who performed mounted military service were differentiated from those who fought as foot-soldiers; those who were unable to finance themselves even as foot-soldiers were legally reduced to servitude.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, Wijnhamer, known as PahWongso, was {{recognised}} in West Java for his promotion of social causes. These included promoting monogamy {{and faith in}} western medicine, as well as combating gambling {{and the use of}} opium and alcohol. In conveying his messages he often used the Sundanese wayang golek (a form of rod puppet), as the local people were generally unable to read. He was able to speak Dutch, Malay, and Javanese fluently, and had some command of Chinese and Japanese. <b>This</b> <b>social</b> work was funded predominantly from PahWongso's day job, selling fried peanuts (kacang goreng).|$|E
5|$|Long-term field {{research}} has shown that range size, group size, social systems, and territorial behavior vary widely, and may be greatly affected by food distribution and quality. It is generally agreed that the ruffed lemur social system is multi-male/multi-female with a fission-fusion society, although some populations of black-and-white ruffed lemur have been reported as monogamous. <b>This</b> <b>social</b> flexibility is suspected to improve survivability despite an inflexible feeding ecology.|$|E

5|$|Among extant strepsirrhines, {{only the}} diurnal and cathemeral lemurs {{have evolved to}} live in multi-male/multi-female groups, {{comparable}} to most living simians. <b>This</b> <b>social</b> trait, seen in two extant lemur families (Indriidae and Lemuridae), {{is thought to have}} evolved independently. Group sizes are smaller in social lemurs than in simians, and despite the similarities, the community structures differ. Female dominance, which is rare in simians, is fairly common in lemurs. Strepsirrhines spend a considerable amount of time grooming each other (allogrooming). When lemuriform primates groom, they lick the fur and then comb it with their toothcomb. They also use their grooming claw to scratch places they cannot reach with their mouth.|$|E
5|$|Castro's {{government}} emphasised social {{projects to}} improve Cuba's standard of living, often {{to the detriment}} of economic development. Major emphasis was placed on education, and during the first 30 months of Castro's government, more classrooms were opened than in the previous 30 years. The Cuban primary education system offered a work-study program, with half of the time spent in the classroom, and the other half in a productive activity. Health care was nationalized and expanded, with rural health centers and urban polyclinics opening up across the island to offer free medical aid. Universal vaccination against childhood diseases was implemented, and infant mortality rates were reduced dramatically. A third part of <b>this</b> <b>social</b> program was the improvement of infrastructure. Within {{the first six months of}} Castro's government, 600 miles of roads were built across the island, while $300 million was spent on water and sanitation projects. Over 800 houses were constructed every month in the early years of the administration in an effort to cut homelessness, while nurseries and day-care centers were opened for children and other centers opened for the disabled and elderly.|$|E
5|$|The California condor has a {{long life}} span, {{reaching}} up to 60 years. If it survives to adulthood, the condor has few natural threats other than humans. Because they lack a syrinx, their vocal display is limited to grunts and hisses. Condors bathe frequently and can spend hours a day preening their feathers. Condors also perform urohidrosis, or defecate on their legs, to reduce their body temperature. There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a pecking order decided by body language, competitive play behavior, {{and a variety of}} hisses and grunts. <b>This</b> <b>social</b> hierarchy is displayed especially when the birds feed, with the dominant birds eating before the younger ones.|$|E

5|$|The Navajo {{may have}} learned to weave from their Pueblo Indian neighbors when they moved into the Four Corners region during the year 1000 A.D. Some experts contend that the Navajo were not weavers until after the 17th century. The Navajo {{obtained}} cotton through local trade routes {{before the arrival of}} the Spanish, after which time they began to use wool. The Pueblo and Navajo were not generally on friendly terms due to frequent Navajo raids on Pueblo settlements, yet many Pueblo sought refuge with their Navajo neighbors in the late 17th century to evade the conquistadors {{in the aftermath of the}} Pueblo Revolt. <b>This</b> <b>social</b> interchange is the probable origin of the distinctive Navajo weaving tradition. Spanish records show that Navajo people began to herd sheep and weave wool blankets from that time onward.|$|E
5|$|The {{region has}} been {{controlled}} by many groups, from the Brigantes, the largest Brythonic kingdom of Great Britain, to the Romans, to Anglo-Saxons, Celts and Danes. After the Norman conquest in 1066, the Harrying of the North brought destruction. The area experienced Anglo-Scottish border fighting until {{the unification of}} Britain under the Stuarts, with some parts changing hands between England and Scotland many times. Many of the innovations of the Industrial Revolution began in Northern England, and its cities were the crucibles {{of many of the}} political changes that accompanied <b>this</b> <b>social</b> upheaval, from trade unionism to Manchester Capitalism. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the economy of the North was dominated by heavy industry such as weaving, shipbuilding, steelmaking and mining. The deindustrialisation that followed {{in the second half of}} the 20th century hit Northern England hard, and many towns remain deprived compared with those in Southern England.|$|E
5|$|Women {{in early}} modern Scotland, between the Renaissance {{of the early}} sixteenth century and the {{beginnings}} of industrialisation in the mid-eighteenth century, {{were part of a}} patriarchal society, though the enforcement of <b>this</b> <b>social</b> order was not absolute in all aspects. Women retained their family surnames at marriage and did not join their husband's kin groups. In higher social ranks, marriages were often political in nature and the subject of complex negotiations in which women as matchmakers or mothers could play a major part. Women were {{a major part of the}} workforce, with many unmarried women acting as farm servants and married women playing a part in all the major agricultural tasks, particularly during harvest. Widows could be found keeping schools, brewing ale and trading, but many at the bottom of society lived a marginal existence.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of <b>this</b> <b>social</b> and {{political}} change, hunter-gatherer egalitarianism is established. As children grow up, they are motivated by those around them to reverse perspective, engaging with other minds {{on the model of}} their own. Selection pressures favour such psychological innovations as imaginative empathy, joint attention, moral judgment, project-oriented collaboration and the ability to evaluate one's own behaviour from the standpoint of others. Underpinning enhanced probabilities of cultural transmission and cumulative cultural evolution, these developments culminate in the establishment of hunter-gatherer-style egalitarianism in association with intersubjective communication and cognition.
