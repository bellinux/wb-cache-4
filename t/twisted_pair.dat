5|$|The D± signals used by low, full, {{and high}} speed are carried over a <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> (typically, unshielded) to reduce noise and crosstalk. SuperSpeed uses {{separate}} transmit and receive differential pairs, which additionally require shielding (typically, shielded <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> but twinax is also mentioned by the specification). Thus, to support SuperSpeed data transmission, cables contain {{twice as many}} wires and are thus larger in diameter.|$|E
5|$|An HDMI {{cable is}} {{composed}} of four shielded twisted pairs, with impedance {{of the order of}} 100Ω (±15%), plus seven separate conductors.

25|$|At {{frequencies}} up {{to about}} 1GHz, pairs of wires are twisted together in a cable, forming a <b>twisted</b> <b>pair.</b> This reduces losses from electromagnetic radiation and inductive coupling. A <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> must be used with a balanced signalling system, so that the two wires carry equal but opposite currents. Each wire in a <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> radiates a signal, but it is effectively cancelled by radiation from the other wire, resulting in almost no radiation loss.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to shielded or foiled <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> (typically F/UTP or S/FTP cable shielding), UTP (unshielded <b>twisted</b> <b>pair)</b> cable is not surrounded by any shielding.

25|$|Deformation: twisted pair's {{susceptibility}} to electromagnetic interference greatly {{depends on the}} pair twisting schemes (sometimes patented by the manufacturers) staying intact during the installation. As a result, <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> cables usually have stringent requirements for maximum pulling tension as well as minimum bend radius. This fragility of <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> cables makes the installation practices {{an important part of}} ensuring the cable's performance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — An {{analysis}} of crosstalk inside a complex aeronautical bundle from an experimental {{and from a}} numerical {{point of view is}} proposed. The numerical model is built as a succession of uniform transmission lines generated randomly. Modeling of the geometrical pattern of <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs</b> is included. Crosstalks between these <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs</b> and single wires inside the bundle are measured and computed. In order to save computation time, a simplified model of the bundle is developed and validated...|$|R
25|$|<b>Twisted</b> <b>pair</b> cabling is {{the most}} popular network cable and is often used in data {{networks}} for short and medium length connections (up to 100 meters or 328 feet). This is due to its relatively lower costs compared to optical fiber and coaxial cable.|$|E
25|$|<b>Twisted</b> <b>pair</b> cables {{are often}} {{shielded}} {{in an attempt}} to prevent electromagnetic interference. Shielding provides an electrically conductive barrier to attenuate electromagnetic waves external to the shield, and provides a conduction path by which induced currents can be circulated and returned to the source, via ground reference connection.|$|E

In the late 20th century, UTPs emerged as the most common cable in computer networking cables, especially as patch cables or temporary network connections. They are increasingly used in video applications, primarily in security cameras.|$|E
40|$|The {{temperature}} of the North End-Calorimeter of the D-Zero detector is to be monitored by several RTD temperature sensors. The location and other important information pertaining to each individual RTD {{is included in the}} following tables, which are grouped by bundle number. There are mne 60 pIll port connectors. Each connector corresponds to a bundle of <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs.</b> <b>Twisted</b> <b>pairs,</b> of one of eight colors along with either a black or white wire, run to 10 -pin connectors which have a mate on the module or cryostat wall. In general, all 60 pins, or all 10 pins are not used. The color scheme of the wires was designed so that all the <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs</b> with white run West from the instrumentation port, and <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs</b> with black run East. This scheme proved to be very successful and efficient during the installation process. After being installed, every RTD connection was checked and their corresponding resistances were recorded by Jerry Blazey. All the RTD's tested successfully, except for 2. The 2 dead RTD's were: Channel 17 on bundle 4, which is located on the front of MH module 8 L; and Channel 13 on bundle 5, which is located on the Bottom of the Middle Coarse Plate of the IH...|$|R
