3000|$|In most cases, the closely defined {{psychological}} {{analysis of}} human–technology interaction wrongly excludes {{the perspective of}} the organisation of societal work. It is here, however, that questions arise whose answers will have considerable consequences for all further development and application steps—for example, at the individual level, whether service work consists exclusively of the instrumental performance of a desired function (as in providing a handicapped individual with food, for example) or whether <b>the</b> <b>service</b> is implicitly or explicitly connected to other wishes or demands (for example that <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>employee</b> [...] "understands" [...] the handicapped person or that <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>employee</b> [...] "notices" [...] that the handicapped person is experiencing acute health problems). In the case of the first option cited (instrumental provision of the desired function of [...] "food intake"), it might be irrelevant as to whether a robot or a human <b>service</b> <b>employee</b> fulfils <b>the</b> function. In the case of the second option, it is not irrelevant, but it cannot be automatically stated that only a human being can fulfil such wishes—this depends on the robot’s performance capabilities (in medical diagnostics, for example) and the reception of the client (for example, as to whether the client feels [...] "understood" [...] by a robot).|$|R
