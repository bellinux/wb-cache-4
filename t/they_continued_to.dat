5|$|Hanson and Heath {{estimate}} that Plato's {{rejection of the}} Homeric tradition was not favorably received by the grassroots Greek civilization.

5|$|Although <b>they</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> have {{players of}} the {{standing}} of Josep Escolà, the club now entered a period of decline, in which political conflict overshadowed sports throughout society. Attendance at matches dropped as the citizens of Barcelona were occupied with discussing political matters. Although the team won the Campionat de Catalunya in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1936 and 1938, success at a national level (with {{the exception of the}} 1937 disputed title) evaded them.|$|E

5|$|Bruce's chosen {{life as an}} explorer, his {{unreliable}} {{sources of}} income and his frequent extended absences, all placed severe strains on the marriage, and the couple became estranged around 1916. However, <b>they</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> {{live in the same}} house until Bruce's death. Eillium became a Merchant Navy officer, eventually captaining a Fisheries Research Ship which, by chance, bore the name Scotia.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, after Laliberté re-privatized Cirque du Soleil, it {{was invited}} to perform at the Los Angeles Arts Festival. Although <b>they</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> be plagued by {{financial}} difficulties, Normand Latourelle took the gamble and went to Los Angeles, despite only having enough money to make a one-way trip. Had the show been a failure, the company {{would not have had}} enough money to get their performers and equipment back to Montreal.|$|E

5|$|In May 2012, {{the team}} was ranked eighth in the world, a {{position}} <b>they</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> hold going into the London Games. The Belles became the first Australian team {{to qualify for the}} Games since 1996, despite attempts to qualify for the 2004 Summer Paralympics and 2008 Summer Paralympics; Australia had qualified automatically for the 2000 Summer Paralympics as the host nation.|$|E
5|$|Mehmed II and {{his successors}} {{continued}} to consider themselves heirs to the Roman Empire until {{the demise of}} the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century following World War 1. They considered that they had simply shifted its religious basis as Constantine had done before, and <b>they</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> refer to their conquered Eastern Roman inhabitants (Orthodox Christians) as Rûm. Meanwhile, the Danubian Principalities (whose rulers also considered themselves the heirs of the Eastern Roman Emperors) harboured Orthodox refugees, including some Byzantine nobles.|$|E
5|$|Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest are {{considered}} both founders of Sheffield F.C. and {{creators of the}} code they adhered to. <b>They</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> have a strong presence at the club, both being members of the committee.

5|$|One {{recorded}} case of courtship behavior involving curve-billed thrashers describes two males attacking {{each other}} vigorously and resorting to purring and hissings sounds when neither bird appeared to relent. The two males then puffed up their chests and strutted {{up and down}} in front of the female. <b>They</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> alternate between purr and hiss and fighting one another until one triumphed. The victor flew towards the female and both chirped melodically before copulation.|$|E
5|$|Sarah {{was famous}} for telling the Queen exactly what she thought, and did not offer her flattery. Anne and Sarah had invented petnames for {{themselves}} during their youths which <b>they</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> use after Anne became queen: Mrs Freeman (Sarah) and Mrs Morley (Anne). Effectively a business manager, Sarah had control over the Queen's position, from her finances to people admitted to the royal presence.|$|E
5|$|Since Andros' {{commission}} included Connecticut, {{he asked}} Connecticut Governor Robert Treat to surrender the colonial charter {{not long after}} his arrival in Boston. Unlike Rhode Island, whose officials readily acceded to the dominion, Connecticut officials formally acknowledged Andros' authority, but did little to assist him. <b>They</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> run their government according to the charter, holding quarterly meetings of the legislature and electing colony-wide officials, while Treat and Andros negotiated over the surrender of the charter.|$|E

5|$|Sunday's {{popularity}} waned after World War I, {{when many}} people in his revival audiences were attracted to radio broadcasts and moving pictures instead. The Sundays' health also declined even as <b>they</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> drive themselves through rounds of revivals—smaller but also with fewer staff members to assist them.|$|E
5|$|Tekno Team 2000 was a {{professional}} wrestling tag team that competed in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from 1995 to 1996, composed of Travis and Troy (son of WWF writer Bill Watts). They started off with strong hype, but did not deliver on it, faltering after winning a few early matches. They {{were sent to the}} WWF's farm territory, United States Wrestling Association (USWA), for practice. After returning, <b>they</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> lose matches and were soon released.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} WWF, McIntyre {{continued}} to wrestle sporadically on the independent circuit. At that time, {{there were not}} many opportunities for females in the business. She competed in the Women's Pro Wrestling organization in the early 1990s. In November 1993, she won the Canadian Wrestling Alliance's Women's Championship from Iron Maiden, but lost it to Iron Maiden again in January 1994. <b>They</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> feud into 1996, when the two women joined Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling, where the two traded the Women's Championship, which McIntyre held for two months. In September, they competed in a strap match—a match where the wrestlers must compete while connected via a leather strap—in which McIntyre was victorious.|$|E
5|$|After the incident, {{the event}} was halted for 15 minutes, until Vince McMahon and other WWF Corporate {{officials}} {{made the decision to}} continue the event. Hart's coworkers, professional wrestlers, and other miscellaneous workers, appeared somber after Hart's fall as <b>they</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> do their jobs. An hour after the event restarted, Ross informed pay-per-view viewers that Hart had {{died at the age of}} 34 at a nearby hospital. The fans in attendance were not told any information about what had happened to Hart, and they did not hear the announcement of his death.|$|E
