2500|$|Agriculture {{has been}} theorized {{to have become}} the {{dominant}} way of producing food since the Neolithic Revolution. [...] Through early biotechnology, the earliest farmers selected and bred <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>suited</b> crops, having the highest yields, to produce enough food to support a growing population. [...] As crops and fields became increasingly large and difficult to maintain, {{it was discovered that}} specific organisms and their by-products could effectively fertilize, restore nitrogen, and control pests. Throughout the history of agriculture, farmers have inadvertently altered the genetics of their crops through introducing them to new environments and breeding them with other plants — one of the first forms of biotechnology.|$|E

Because the film's actors received no mention, Griffith had to make discreet inquiries to learn she was Florence Lawrence and to arrange a meeting. Griffith had intended to give the part to Biograph's leading lady, Florence Turner, but Lawrence managed to convince Solter and Griffith that she was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>suited</b> for the starring role in The Girl and the Outlaw.

2500|$|An {{important}} {{example is}} Henri Poincaré, who in 1898 {{argued that the}} simultaneity of two events {{is a matter of}} convention. In 1900, he recognized that Lorentz's [...] "local time" [...] is actually what is indicated by moving clocks by applying an explicitly operational definition of clock synchronization assuming constant light speed. In 1900 and 1904, he suggested the inherent undetectability of the aether by emphasizing the validity of what he called the principle of relativity, and in 1905/1906 he mathematically perfected Lorentz's theory of electrons in order to bring it into accordance with the postulate of relativity. While discussing various hypotheses on Lorentz invariant gravitation, he introduced the innovative concept of a 4-dimensional space-time by defining various four vectors, namely four-position, four-velocity, and four-force. He did not pursue the 4-dimensional formalism in subsequent papers, however, stating that this line of research seemed to [...] "entail great pain for limited profit", ultimately concluding [...] "that three-dimensional language seems <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>suited</b> to the description of our world". Furthermore, even as late as 1909, Poincaré continued to believe in the dynamical interpretation of the Lorentz transform. For these and other reasons, most historians of science argue that Poincaré did not invent what is now called special relativity.|$|E
2500|$|While {{not writing}} {{negatively}} {{about the system}} of checks and balances as it exists in the United States, Yang claims that the people's congress system of [...] "one governments and two courts" [...] (the institutions of the People's Courts and the People's Procuratorates) is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>suited</b> for Chinese conditions, since it is [...] "the best form to reflect our country’s national essence." [...] In the people's democratic system, the courts are both responsible to and supervised by the people's congresses. In this system, Yang adds, the judiciary is {{under the control of the}} National People's Congress (NPC) and its Standing Committee (SC). The NPC (or the SC), are responsible for supervising the implementation of the constitution, and judicial organs are granted judicial independence (through their respective people's congresses). These courts are not subject to interference by groups, individuals and are solely responsible to the people's congresses at their respective level. However, as Yang puts it;Accordingly, our country’s judicial organs, both trial organs and procuratorial organs, shall implement their powers independently according to the provisions of the law, but in terms of politics, ideology and organization, they must be under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. The Socialist rule of law concept is persisting in 'governing the country according to the law, a judiciary for the people, fairness and justice, serving the bigger picture, and the leadership of the Party.' ...|$|E
