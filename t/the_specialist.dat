40|$|Despite <b>the</b> {{importance}} of <b>specialists</b> to <b>the</b> audit of significant accounting estimates, PCAOB inspection reports highlight instances where auditors discount advice received from a specialist. I examine when and why auditors discount a specialist?s advice. I find that auditors discount a specialist?s advice {{when it is}} evaluated {{at the same time}} as irrelevant advice from colleagues that consistently supports an alternate position. In doing so, auditors evaluate advice by applying a ?consensus implies correctness? heuristic, instead of evaluating the advice?s relevance. I also find that when auditors first evaluate only irrelevant colleagues? advice and then evaluate <b>the</b> <b>specialist?s</b> advice, they change their assessments to align with <b>the</b> <b>specialist?s</b> advice. Results suggest that separately evaluating <b>the</b> <b>specialist?s</b> advice and colleagues? advice mitigates the effects of the consensus heuristic and discounting of <b>the</b> <b>specialist?s</b> advice. My results should be of interest to the PCAOB and public accounting firms as they revise audit guidance to increase reliance on specialist advice...|$|R

5|$|To {{minimize}} Soviet opposition, Norway {{attempted to}} move the debate from the political to <b>the</b> <b>specialist</b> scene, {{while at the same}} time establishing a protocol for Norwegian control and operation of the facility.

This would particularly focus on the regular inspection of auxiliary equipment. To depoliticize the issue further, the government appointed the semi-independent NTNF as the operator of the facility. The first oral consultations between the Soviet embassy and the Norwegian government took place in November 1964.|$|E

5|$|Promoted to {{temporary}} flight lieutenant on 1 August 1943, McAloney {{was sent}} to the Directorate of Technical Services from November as <b>the</b> <b>specialist</b> officer on American and gas turbine jet engines.

He returned to Australia and his position with Technical Services in December, and saw out the remainder of the war in this post. McAloney decided he wanted to remain in the Air Force on the cessation of hostilities, and subsequently sought a permanent commission in the post-war RAAF. Having continued on a short-service commission in the meantime, his application was ultimately approved in September 1948 and he was granted the substantive rank of flight lieutenant. His younger brother, Robert Simpson McAloney, also saw service with the RAAF in the Second World War.

Pathan's career was put on hold after he suffered a side strain in the following Test in Chennai, in which he totalled 0/68, causing him to miss the Tests in Nagpur and Mumbai. Australia went on to take the series 2–1 and Pathan ended with two wickets at 84.00 and 100 runs at 33.33. After being overlooked for the First Test with selectors opting for three spinners, he returned in the Second Test against South Africa in Kolkata, aggregating 3/89 and scoring 24 in an eight-wicket win that sealed a 1–0 series win.|$|E
