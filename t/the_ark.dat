5|$|An {{alternate}} ending {{appears in}} the film's DVD version. After Captain Michaels (<b>the</b> <b>Ark</b> 4 captain) announces that they are heading for the Cape of Good Hope, Adrian receives a phone call. He answers the call, and is shocked to recognize the voice as his father's (Harry). Harry tells Adrian that he, his friend Tony (whose left arm is in a sling) and several others survived the megatsunami and are shipwrecked on an island. Adrian informs Captain Michaels of this and <b>the</b> <b>Ark</b> heads for them. Kate thanks Laura {{for taking care of}} Lilly, and Laura tells Jackson that she enjoyed his book. Jackson returns Noah's cell phone, which he recovered during <b>the</b> <b>Ark</b> 4 flood. Lilly says that she sees an island, and <b>the</b> <b>ark</b> finds the shipwrecked cruise ship Genesis and her survivors on a beach.|$|E
5|$|Evan loads {{hundreds}} of animals onto <b>the</b> <b>Ark</b> {{in front of}} {{hundreds of}} spectators and live news crews, who continue to mock him. Later, Long and the policemen arrive with a wrecking ball crew to try and destroy <b>the</b> <b>ark,</b> since it violates numerous building codes in Prestige Crest. When the wrecking crew threatens to demolish <b>the</b> <b>ark</b> within three minutes, a brief rainstorm occurs, prompting some of the spectators to leave. The rain also prevents the crew from proceeding, buying Evan a little time. Evan connects Long's profiteering ethics and what God had already {{told him about the}} original form of Prestige Crest, and realizes that the dam under Long Lake had violated building codes and will likely prepare to burst. Evan warns to those present must immediately board <b>the</b> <b>ark,</b> and many have do so when the prophesied flood is triggered soon after the dam bursts. Prestige Crest is catastrophically destroyed, and <b>the</b> <b>ark</b> later rides the flood through the streets and landmarks of Washington, D.C.. <b>The</b> <b>ark</b> reaches its final destination in front of the Capitol, which disrupts the vote on the Public Land Act bill. Long becomes outraged that the flood did really happen. Evan informs Long that the flood was actually caused by his poor design of the dam, which prompts the other Congressmen also present to turn against Long.|$|E
5|$|Mendicant Bias {{is first}} {{encountered}} in Halo 3 on <b>the</b> <b>Ark,</b> as it attempted {{to communicate with}} the Master Chief through Terminals, claiming it sought atonement for its defection to the Flood by helping the Spartan, and was presumably destroyed along with <b>the</b> <b>Ark</b> when the Chief activated the incomplete Halo that <b>the</b> <b>Ark</b> was constructing.|$|E
50|$|In {{the year}} 2090, a new energy source is invented and a city is {{constructed}} {{to focus on}} the further development of this energy called Oliver Port. In response, a company called LugnalCorp utilizes this energy source for the development of conscious mecha known as ARKS (Artificial Reflexive Keneticoid). Due to the high industrial demand for <b>the</b> <b>ARKs,</b> LugnalCorp rushes <b>the</b> <b>ARKs</b> into production; after a while of operation, <b>the</b> <b>ARKs</b> rebel against their human operators and start their rebellion over Oliver Port.

5|$|The Torah ark had the {{capacity}} to house 50 Torah scrolls and was built on two levels. It was flanked by four Corinthian columns surrounded by baroque woodcuts depicting flowers and birds. <b>The</b> <b>Ark,</b> together with its ornamental gates, were taken from the Nikolayevsky Synagogue in Kherson, Russia, which had been used by Russian Jewish conscripts forced to spend twenty-five years in the Imperial Russian Army. Directly above <b>the</b> <b>Ark</b> was a triangular window with rounded points. To the right and in front of <b>the</b> <b>ark</b> was the cantor's podium, which was designed as a miniature version of the two-level Ark.|$|E
5|$|The next day, a Nazi U-boat appears and {{intercepts}} the ship. Belloq and Dietrich seize <b>the</b> <b>Ark</b> and Marion but cannot locate Jones, who stows away {{aboard the}} U-boat and travels {{with them to}} {{an island in the}} Aegean Sea. Once there, Belloq plans to test the power of <b>the</b> <b>Ark</b> before presenting it to Hitler. Jones reveals himself and threatens to destroy <b>the</b> <b>Ark</b> with a panzerfaust, but Belloq calls his bluff and Jones surrenders rather than destroy such an important historical artifact. The Nazis take Indy and Marion to an area where <b>the</b> <b>Ark</b> will be opened and tie them to a post to observe. Belloq performs a ceremonial opening of <b>the</b> <b>Ark,</b> which appears to contain nothing but sand, all that remains of the Ten Commandments. Suddenly, angelic ghost-like beings emerge from <b>the</b> <b>Ark.</b> Indy cautions Marion to keep her eyes closed and not to observe what happens next. Belloq and the others look on in astonishment as the apparitions are suddenly revealed to be angels of death. A vortex of flame forms above <b>the</b> <b>Ark</b> and shoots bolts of fiery energy into the gathered Nazi soldiers, killing them all. As Belloq, Toht and Dietrich all scream in terror, <b>the</b> <b>Ark</b> turns its fury on them: Dietrich's head shrivels up, Toht's face is melted off his skull and Belloq's head explodes. Flames then engulf the remains of the doomed assembly, save for Indy and Marion, and the pillar of fire rises into the sky. The Ark's lid is blasted high into the air before dropping back down onto <b>the</b> <b>Ark</b> and sealing it. Jones and Marion find their ropes burned off and embrace.|$|E

Everyone works to access the cannon's core and neutralize <b>the</b> <b>ARK</b> using the Master Emerald.|$|E

50|$|The Resistance {{is led by}} Brother Chen, a {{name that}} the Resistance affectionately uses for him. Joseph Chen played a {{significant}} part in <b>the</b> <b>Ark's</b> construction and design. However, he became angry at the Founders' and Security's decision to ration water and isolate <b>the</b> <b>Ark's</b> refugees from <b>the</b> rest of the island while Security and the Founders live in luxury. Chen armed and founded The Resistance, a group of well-trained refugees, and demanded that the Founders share <b>the</b> <b>Ark's</b> resources, and water, equally. The Resistance's goal in Brink is to protect refugees from Security forces, distribute Ark's resources to those in need, and to establish {{contact with the outside}} world. The Resistance agrees with Chen that <b>the</b> Founders and <b>Ark</b> Security are corrupt and oppressive, and that only the outside world can help them.|$|R
5|$|Jones {{returns to}} his {{teaching}} position at a New England college, where he is interviewed by two Army Intelligence agents. They inform him that the Nazis are searching for his old mentor, Abner Ravenwood, under whom Jones studied at the University of Chicago. The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of Tanis in Egypt, and that he possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for <b>the</b> <b>Ark</b> of the Covenant – the Nazis believe that if they acquire <b>the</b> <b>Ark,</b> their armies will become invincible. The Staff of Ra {{is the key to}} finding the Well of Souls, a secret chamber in which <b>the</b> <b>Ark</b> is buried.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ark,</b> also {{referred}} to as Installation 00, is located outside the Milky Way galaxy and serves as the construction and control station for the Halo weapon system. It does not share the ringworld geometry of the other installations. During Halo 3, the Covenant discover a portal on Earth that leads to <b>the</b> <b>Ark</b> and are pursued by the humans and a breakaway faction of Covenant opposed to activating the rings. Gravemind, having hijacked High Charity, crash-lands on the installation. The remote firing of the rings is halted by Master Chief and the Arbiter. In order to end the threat of the Flood, Master Chief decides to activate Installation 04B under construction in <b>The</b> <b>Ark,</b> the replacement for the Halo that he destroyed in Halo: Combat Evolved. Unknown to everyone but 343 Guilty Spark, a premature firing would destroy the installation; the monitor attempted to defend 'his' ring but was destroyed by Master Chief, who proceeded to fire the weapon. The firing tears apart the incomplete Halo and severely damages <b>The</b> <b>Ark</b> as Master Chief, Cortana, and the Arbiter try to escape through the Portal, which closes as they enter, leaving Master Chief and Cortana drifting in space while the Arbiter returns to Earth successfully. <b>The</b> <b>Ark</b> appears in other Halo novels and the video game Halo Wars 2.|$|E
