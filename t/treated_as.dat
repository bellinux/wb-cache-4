5|$|Capital {{within the}} EU may be {{transferred}} in any amount {{from one country}} to another. All intra-EU transfers in euro are <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> domestic transactions and bear the corresponding domestic transfer costs. This includes all member states of the EU, even those outside the eurozone providing the transactions are carried out in euro. Credit/debit card charging and ATM withdrawals within the eurozone are also <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> domestic transactions; however paper-based payment orders, like cheques, have not been standardised so these are still domestic-based. The ECB has also set up a clearing system, TARGET, for large euro transactions.|$|E

5|$|Hire-purchase {{agreements}} are also regulated by this Act. The provisions {{are very similar}} to those for sale of goods agreements, with the section on exclusion clauses identical. Under the 1893 Act, conditional sale agreements (where the buyer takes possession of the goods, but the seller retains the right to repossess them) were <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> hire-purchase agreements, despite being fundamentally sales. With the unification of provisions for hire-purchase and sale of goods agreements, conditional sale {{agreements are}} now <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> sales.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> such. This {{does not mean that we}} can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E
