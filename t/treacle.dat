Bitumen has a velvety, lustrous appearance when first painted, but {{over a period of}} time discolours to a black <b>treacle,</b> while contracting and thus creating a wrinkled surface, which cannot be renovated. As a result of this, details in large areas of the work can hardly be discerned today.|$|E
5|$|The North {{is known}} for its often crumbly cheeses, of which Cheshire cheese is the {{earliest}} example. Unlike Southern cheeses like Cheddar, Northern cheeses typically use uncooked milk and a pre-salted curd pressed under enormous weights, resulting in a moist, sharp-tasting cheese. Wensleydale, another crumbly cheese, is unusual in that it is often served as a side to sweet cakes, which are themselves well represented in Northern England. Parkin, an oatmeal cake with black <b>treacle</b> and ginger, is a traditional treat across the North on Bonfire Night, and the fruity scone-like singing hinny and fat rascal are popular in the North East and Yorkshire respectively.|$|E

5|$|Australian ravens die {{most often}} by being shot or poisoned—generally by farmers. Despite their fondness for roadkill, fewer ravens are hit by {{vehicles}} than Australian magpies. Research in the 1950s and 60s showed that 64% of Australian ravens perished {{in their first}} year of life. Immature birds are most at risk of dying as {{they are more likely to}} come into conflict with farmers. The Australian Raven is a peaceful bird, showing no aggression toward humans or other birds without reason. However, the Australian raven is frequently blamed for the loss of young lambs. Scientific observation in the country's southeast showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare, but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked. Australian ravens mostly eat faeces (often from the lamb's anus), afterbirth or stillborn lambs. Newborn lamb faeces is nutritious, containing around 21–44% protein, 9–37% fat and 10–30% carbohydrate. It has the consistency of <b>treacle</b> and often sticks to the lamb's hindquarters or tail. The raven bites a sleeping lamb's tail, holding on and walking behind it when it wakes up. A healthy lamb would respond by running away or butting the bird, but a sick one might not respond and be attacked further as it alerts the bird that it is vulnerable. Wounded lambs can also succumb to Clostridium infection as these bacteria are present on raven bills. Ravens bring some benefits to agricultural areas as they clean away carrion and eat insects that are potentially damaging to crops. In areas of Western Australia, the species is classified as a Declared Pest of Agriculture under the provisions of the Agriculture and Related Resources Protection Act 1976, meaning that shooting on private land in rural areas is legal, although should be considered only after other options have been exhausted.|$|E

40|$|Title Impact of Grey Imports on Brand New Car Dealers: The Case of Malawi and Botswana Background Rapid {{change in}} {{technology}} causes frequent improvements in durable goods like cars. Planned obsolescence and strict legislation make most car owners in rich countries like Japan to dispose off {{their cars and}} get new ones. This has led to growth of the market of gray imports in many Third World countries like Malawi and Botswana because the main consideration in purchasing a car by average income earners is affordability. Purpose The {{purpose of this paper}} was {{to find out if the}} increase in gray imports market has affected the brand new car dealers negatively by being substitute products to brand new cars. The study sought to answer the following questions. It sought to answer the following questions, a) What is the impact of grey imports on brand new car dealers’ sales in Malawi and Botswana?, and b) If the impact is negative, what strategies are they using in reaction to that impact? Findings The market for brand new cars is mainly fueled by bank loans, government loans and the government is the main customer (in Malawi and Botswana). OEM and OCM have great influence in South Africa that <b>treacles</b> down and affects the market of gray imports. Gray imports did not have a huge negative impact on brand new cars. Conclusion Gray imports affected sales of volume brands because gray imports have positive cross elasticity of demand and are therefore substitutes to low-level volume brands. Economy and premium brands have hardly been affected. Dealerships that have been affected mainly engage in strenuous marketing of back-up services to convince people to buy entry level (volume brand) brand new cars than going for gray imports that do not have back-up service and warranties. + 267 743 439 72; + 1 717 263 145...|$|R

25|$|Komatiitic lava was {{extremely}} fluid when it erupted (possessing the viscosity {{close to that}} of water but with the density of rock). Compared to the basaltic lava of the Hawaiian plume basalts at ~1200°C, which flows the way <b>treacle</b> or honey does, the komatiitic lava would have flowed swiftly across the surface, leaving extremely thin lava flows (down to 10mm thick). The major komatiitic sequences preserved in Archaean rocks are thus considered to be lava tubes, ponds of lava etc., where the komatiitic lava accumulated.|$|E

25|$|The town {{is known}} for {{gingerbread}} biscuits which were first made in 1740 by William Eggleston. Eggleston, a baker by trade, was a producer of a biscuit called Grantham Whetstones. Whetsones were a rusk like dry biscuit enjoyed locally and also by coach drivers who used to stop in Grantham to change their horses whilst travelling on the Great North road. According to folklore, Egglestone, whilst baking whetsones in his dimly lit kitchen one morning, mistook one ingredient for another, resulting in a ginger-like biscuit {{to emerge from the}} oven. The mistake was a huge success and the biscuit became established as Grantham gingerbread, known as a white gingerbread because it is not made with molasses or black <b>treacle.</b> This provides a delicate ginger flavour, rich in butter, with a domed top that has a crackled surface. The centre is hollow and resembles a honeycomb.|$|E

Imported spices now formed a part of almost all noble and gentry diets, with the quantities being consumed varying according to {{the wealth of the}} household. The English government was also importing large quantities of raw materials, including copper, for manufacturing weapons. Many major landowners tended to focus their efforts on maintaining a single major castle or house rather than the dozens a century before, but these were usually decorated much more luxurious than previously. Major merchants' dwellings, too, were more lavish than in previous years.|$|E
500|$|Clotted {{cream is}} an {{essential}} part of a cream tea, a favourite with tourists particularly in Cornwall and Devon. It is served on scones—or the more traditional [...] "splits" [...] in Cornwall—with strawberry jam (other flavours are generally less acceptable), along with a pot of tea. Traditionally, there are differences in the way it is eaten in each county: in Devon, the cream is traditionally spread first on the scone, with the jam dolloped on top. In Cornwall the jam is spread first with a dollop of cream. Cream teas, known as Devonshire Teas, spread to southern Australia as early immigrants from Cornwall and Devon took their traditional recipes with them. In 2010, Langage Farm in Devon started a campaign for [...] "Devon cream tea" [...] to have protected designation of origin similar to [...] "Cornish clotted cream". One variation on a cream tea is called [...] "Thunder and Lightning" [...] which consists of a round of bread topped with clotted cream and golden syrup, honey, or <b>treacle.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Magma that erupts from {{a volcano}} behaves {{according}} to its viscosity, determined by temperature, composition, crystal content {{and the amount of}} silica. [...] High-temperature magma, most of which is basaltic in composition, behaves {{in a manner similar to}} thick oil and, as it cools, <b>treacle.</b> Long, thin basalt flows with pahoehoe surfaces are common. Intermediate composition magma, such as andesite, tends to form cinder cones of intermingled ash, tuff and lava, and may have a viscosity similar to thick, cold molasses or even rubber when erupted. Felsic magma, such as rhyolite, is usually erupted at low temperature and is up to 10,000 times as viscous as basalt. Volcanoes with rhyolitic magma commonly erupt explosively, and rhyolitic lava flows are typically of limited extent and have steep margins, because the magma is so viscous.|$|E
