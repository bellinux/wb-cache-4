5|$|Coleman has {{speculated that}} modern-day {{prosperity}} theology borrows heavily from the New Thought movement, though {{he admits that}} the connection is sometimes unclear. Jenkins notes that critics draw a parallel between prosperity theology and the cargo cult phenomenon. While citing the popularity of prosperity theology in agrarian African communities, he argues that it can also bear similarities to <b>traditional</b> <b>African</b> religious rituals. J. Matthew Wilson of Southern Methodist University compares the movement to Black theology owing to its focus on uplifting oppressed groups, though he notes that it differs in its concentration on individual success rather than corporate political change.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The initial {{forces of}} {{globalization}} that hugely affected {{the development of}} <b>African</b> <b>Traditional</b> Religion, were the forces of Colonialism and the Missionary Enterprises of both Islam and Christianity. This piece therefore studied the meaning and nature of <b>African</b> <b>Traditional</b> Religion {{in the midst of}} the globalizing process. It first studies the meaning of religion and Africa, as basis for understanding <b>African</b> <b>Traditional</b> Religion; it further studies the peculiarities of <b>African</b> <b>Traditional</b> Religion in the midst of other religions in the globalizing world; the derogatory concepts given to <b>African</b> <b>Traditional</b> Religion with the emergence of globalization, the difficulties of studying <b>African</b> <b>Traditional</b> Religion and reasons why it should be studied. It submits that in spite of the declining numbers of the followers of <b>African</b> <b>Traditional</b> Religion, it will continue to be a living religion in many years to come...|$|R

5|$|People {{from the}} North-West and South-West provinces, {{which used to}} be a part of British Cameroons, are largely Protestant. The French-speaking regions of the {{southern}} and western regions are largely Catholic. Southern ethnic groups predominantly follow Christian or <b>traditional</b> <b>African</b> animist beliefs, or a syncretic combination of the two. People widely believe in witchcraft, and the government outlaws such practices. Suspected witches are often subject to mob violence. The Islamist jihadist group Boko Haram has been reported as operating in North Cameroon.|$|E
5|$|The September 4 and 5 {{sessions}} featured only Jackson and Scott-Heron {{playing and}} recording. The limited personnel during these sessions {{allowed them to}} rely mostly on <b>traditional</b> <b>African</b> and R sounds and influences, along with more creative and artistic control of the project. More {{than half of the}} album's songs were co-written and produced by Jackson. His input also helped solidify his partnership with Scott-Heron, leading to further records together before their split in 1978.|$|E
5|$|Winter in America is {{a studio}} album by American vocalist Gil Scott-Heron and keyboardist Brian Jackson. It was {{recorded}} in September to October 1973 at D Sound Studio in Silver Spring, Maryland and released in May 1974 by Strata-East Records. Scott-Heron and Jackson produced the album in a stripped-down fashion, relying on <b>traditional</b> <b>African</b> and R sounds, while Jackson's piano-based arrangements were rooted in jazz and the blues. The subject matter on Winter in America deals with the African-American community and inner city in the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|Imported operettas and {{domestic}} productions by both whites like Cohan and blacks like Cook, Europe and Johnson {{all had a}} formative influence on Broadway. Composers like Gershwin, Porter and Kern made comedic musical theater into a national pastime, with a feel that was distinctly American and not dependent on European models. Most of these individuals were Jewish, with Cole Porter the only major exception; they were the descendants of 19th century immigrants fleeing persecution in the Russian Empire, settled most influentially in various neighborhoods in New York City. Many of the early musicals were influenced by black music, showing elements of early jazz, such as In Dahomey; the Jewish composers of these works may have seen connections between the <b>traditional</b> <b>African</b> American blue notes and their own folk Jewish music.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum was}} founded in 1964 by a Foreign Service officer and layman who bought African art objects in Germany and {{multiple}} houses in the Capitol Hill neighborhood in which to display them. The collection focused on <b>traditional</b> <b>African</b> art and an educational mission to teach black cultural heritage. To ensure the museum's longevity, the founder lobbied the national legislature to adopt the museum under the Smithsonian's auspices. It joined the Smithsonian in 1979 and became the National Museum of African Art two years later. A new, mostly underground museum building was completed in 1987, just off the National Mall and adjacent to other Smithsonian museums. It is among the Smithsonian's smallest museums.|$|E

5|$|Born in Johannesburg to Swazi and Xhosa parents, Makeba {{was forced}} to find {{employment}} as a child {{after the death of}} her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Her vocal talent had been recognised when she was a child, and she began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, the Manhattan Brothers, and an all-woman group, the Skylarks, performing a mixture of jazz, <b>traditional</b> <b>African</b> melodies, and Western popular music. In 1959, Makeba had a brief role in the anti-apartheid film Come Back, Africa, which brought her international attention, and led to her performing in Venice, London, and New York City. In London, she met the American singer Harry Belafonte, who became a mentor and colleague. She moved to New York City, where she became immediately popular, and recorded her first solo album in 1960. Her attempt to return to South Africa that year for her mother's funeral was prevented by the country's government.|$|E
5|$|Opening ceremonies {{took place}} at 8pm AST on 12 August. 10,000 people watched 68 {{countries}} participate in the opening ceremonies that included Canoe'09 chair Chris Keevill, ICF President José Perurena, and Sport Canada minister Gary Lunn. The Concert on the Lake {{took place at}} 8pm AST on 14 August with over 10,000 attendees. Closing ceremonies occurred on 16 August at 4pm AST. Medals were presented in Mi'kmaq baskets for gold medalists, traditional European baskets for silver medalists, and in <b>traditional</b> <b>African</b> Nova Scotian baskets for bronze medalists. Mi'kmaq is a territory in the Atlantic Provinces of Canada prior to the settlement by the French in the 17th century. The settlement was rotated between the French and British between 1627 and 1755 before the British took over the area after the French and Indian War. Africans settled in Nova Scotia during the Atlantic slave trade that ran from the 16th to 19th centuries. The closing ceremonies on 16 August included passing the ICF flag from Dartmouth to the 2010 world championship hosts in Poznań.|$|E

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the eighteenth century, Christianity began to spread across North Africa; this shift in religion began displacing <b>traditional</b> <b>African</b> spiritual practices.

25|$|There {{are more}} {{similarities}} than differences in all <b>traditional</b> <b>African</b> religions. Often, the supreme God is worshiped through consultation or communion with lesser deities and ancestral spirits. The deities and spirits are honored through libation, sacrifice (of animals, vegetables, cooked food, flowers, semi-precious stones, precious metals, etc.). The will of God is {{sought by the}} believer also through consultation of oracular deities, or divination. In many <b>traditional</b> <b>African</b> religions, there is a belief in a cyclical nature of reality. The living stand between their ancestors and the unborn. <b>Traditional</b> <b>African</b> religions embrace natural phenomena– ebb and tide, waxing and waning moon, rain and drought– and the rhythmic pattern of agriculture. According to Gottlieb and Mbiti: The environment and nature are infused {{in every aspect of}} <b>traditional</b> <b>African</b> religions and culture. This is largely because cosmology and beliefs are intricately intertwined with the natural phenomena and environment. All aspects of weather, thunder, lightning, rain, day, moon, sun, stars, and so on may become amenable to control through the cosmology of African people. Natural phenomena are responsible for providing people with their daily needs.|$|E
