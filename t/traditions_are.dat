5|$|A {{number of}} <b>traditions</b> <b>are</b> upheld and {{recognised}} by choristers. Club members snap their fingers instead of clapping at each other's achievements (i.e. {{a good performance}} on a solo) {{because it is more}} difficult to clap with one's music in the other hand. The club hosts a banquet every spring where awards are presented.|$|E
5|$|When Australia's {{part-time}} {{military force}} was reformed in 1948 as the Citizens Military Force, the regiment was not re-raised {{in its own}} right, although an amalgamated unit known as the 12th/16th Hunter River Lancers was established. Through this unit the 12th Light Horse Regiment's honours and <b>traditions</b> <b>are</b> perpetuated.|$|E

50|$|Ngerebong in {{the village}} of Kesiman, Denpasar, means of assembly, the {{gathering}} of the god. Ngerebong <b>is</b> a <b>tradition</b> that <b>is</b> held by the people Hindu in Pura Pangrebongan. This <b>tradition</b> <b>is</b> usually done every six months in a calendar calendar Bali which is on the Sunday or Pon Redite wuku Medangsia. Usually the streets are closed when the <b>tradition</b> <b>is</b> being carried out, because people believe this <b>tradition</b> <b>is</b> a sacred <b>tradition.</b> Community Ngerebong ceremony began with prayers in temple.|$|R
5|$|Characteristics of Dominican music {{include the}} West African use of call and {{response}} singing, clapping {{as a major}} part of rhythm and lyrical, dance and rhythmic improvisation. Lyrics are almost all in Dominican Creole French, and are traditionally sung by women (chantwèl), while the instrumental <b>traditions</b> <b>are</b> predominantly practiced by men. Drums, generically known as lapo kabwit, are the most prominent part of Dominica's instrumental tradition.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to jwé and other music performed for entertainment, Saint Lucia {{is also home}} to styles used only for specific occasions. These include work songs, drinking songs, funereal music and serenades and masquerades. The latter two <b>traditions</b> <b>are</b> nearly extinct in modern Saint Lucia. The masquerade was a celebration held near holidays like Easter and New Year's Day, which included an orchestra consisting of a tanbou tenbal, chakchak and a bamboo flute. This same ensemble also traditionally performs for cockfights, merry-go-rounds and vocal serenades, called séwinal in Lucian Creole.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous peoples were {{producing}} art {{for thousands}} of years before the arrival of European settler colonists and the eventual establishment of Canada as a nation state. Like the peoples who produced them, indigenous art traditions spanned territories across North America. Indigenous art <b>traditions</b> <b>are</b> organized by art historians according to cultural, linguistic or regional groups: Northwest Coast, Plateau, Plains, Eastern Woodlands, Subarctic, and Arctic.|$|E

5|$|Instrumental {{and vocal}} {{classical}} music is an iconic part of Italian identity, spanning experimental art music and international fusions to symphonic music and opera. Opera {{is integral to}} Italian musical culture, {{and has become a}} major segment of popular music. The Neapolitan song, canzone napoletana, and the cantautori singer-songwriter <b>traditions</b> <b>are</b> also popular domestic styles that form {{an important part of the}} Italian music industry, alongside imported genres like jazz, rock and hip hop. Italian folk music is an important part of the country's musical heritage, and spans a diverse array of regional styles, instruments and dances.|$|E
5|$|Other Christian {{denominations}} {{that are}} active in York include the Religious Society of Friends who have three meeting houses, Methodists within the York Circuit of The Methodist Church York and Hull District, and Unitarians. St Columba's United Reformed Church in Priory Street, originally built for the Presbyterians, dates from 1879. There is one mosque in York and the city also has a UK Islamic Mission Islamic centre. Various Buddhist <b>traditions</b> <b>are</b> represented {{in the city and}} around York.|$|E
5|$|Though these larger {{philosophical}} <b>traditions</b> <b>are</b> clear {{influences on}} The Age of Reason, Paine owes the greatest intellectual {{debt to the}} English deists of the early eighteenth century, such as Peter Annet. John Toland had argued {{for the use of}} reason in interpreting scripture, Matthew Tindal had argued against revelation, Middleton had described the Bible as mythology and questioned the existence of miracles, Thomas Morgan had disputed the claims of the Old Testament, Thomas Woolston had questioned the believability of miracles and Thomas Chubb had maintained that Christianity lacked morality. All of these arguments appear in The Age of Reason, albeit less coherently.|$|E

5000|$|A very {{peculiar}} <b>tradition</b> <b>is</b> still {{maintained by}} some of the population: known as rapimento ("kidnapping"), it consists in the kidnapping of the future bride some time before the wedding is celebrated.

5|$|While the Tiberian, Babylonian, and Palestinian reading <b>traditions</b> <b>are</b> extinct, {{various other}} systems of {{pronunciation}} have evolved over time, notably the Yemenite, Sephardi, Ashkenazi, and Samaritan traditions. Modern Hebrew pronunciation {{is also used}} by some to read biblical texts. The modern reading traditions do not stem solely from the Tiberian system; for instance, the Sephardic tradition's distinction between qamatz gadol and qatan is pre-Tiberian. However, the only orthographic system used to mark vowels is the Tiberian vocalization.|$|E
5|$|Widespread {{segregation}} in 19th- and early 20th-century North America {{made it difficult}} for African-Americans to join Lodges outside of Prince Hall jurisdictions– and impossible for inter-jurisdiction recognition between the parallel U.S. Masonic authorities. By the 1980s, such discrimination was a thing of the past, and today most U.S. Grand Lodges recognise their Prince Hall counterparts, and the authorities of both <b>traditions</b> <b>are</b> working towards full recognition. The United Grand Lodge of England has no problem with recognising Prince Hall Grand Lodges. While celebrating their heritage as lodges of black Americans, Prince Hall is open to all men regardless of race or religion.|$|E
5|$|Costly {{religious}} rituals such as male circumcision, {{food and}} water deprivation, and snake handling look paradoxical in evolutionary terms. Devout religious beliefs wherein such <b>traditions</b> <b>are</b> practiced therefore appear maladaptive. Religion may have arisen to increase and maintain intragroup cooperation. Cooperation leads to altruistic behaviour, and costly signalling could explain this. All religions may involve costly and elaborate rituals, performed publicly, to demonstrate loyalty to the religious group. In this way, group members increase their allegiance to the group by signalling their investment in group interests. However, as group size increases among humans, the threat of free riders grows. Costly signalling theory accounts for this by proposing that these religious rituals are costly enough to deter free riders.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, {{as part of}} a re-organisation of Australia's {{military}} {{following the}} disbandment of the AIF, the regiment was re-raised as a part-time unit of the Citizens Force based in New South Wales. It remained in existence throughout the inter-war years until it was amalgamated with the 24th Light Horse Regiment in 1936 as a result of manpower shortages. The 12th Light Horse Regiment was re-formed in 1938 and undertook garrison duties in Australia during the Second World War, having been converted first to a motor regiment and then to an armoured car regiment. It was disbanded in 1943 without having seen action and was never re-raised. Its honours and <b>traditions</b> <b>are</b> perpetuated in the 12th/16th Hunter River Lancers.|$|E
5|$|Many fungi {{have been}} used as folk {{medicines}} around the world, including in Europe and in India where <b>traditions</b> <b>are</b> well documented. Some have been found to have useful active ingredients, though these do not always correspond with traditional uses of the fungi concerned. Ergot and various cereal smuts, such as Ustilago tritici (wheat grain smut) were used for disorders of pregnancy. Yeasts, made into a boiled paste with wheat flour, were used in India to treat fevers and dysentery. Wounds were treated in Europe with moulds, using for example a slice of mouldy bread or mouldy wheat straw, with active ingredients patulin and other penicillin-like compounds.|$|E
5|$|Other Italian {{folk song}} <b>traditions</b> <b>are</b> less common than ballads and lyric songs. Strophic, {{religious}} laude, sometimes in Latin, are still occasionally performed, and epic songs are also known, {{especially those of}} the maggio celebration. Professional female singers perform dirges similar in style to those elsewhere in Europe. Yodeling exists in northern Italy, though it is most commonly associated with the folk musics of other Alpine nations. The Italian Carnival is associated with several song types, especially the Carnival of Bagolino, Brescia. Choirs and brass bands {{are a part of}} the mid-Lenten holiday, while the begging song tradition extends through many holidays throughout the year.|$|E
50|$|Although many of {{the poets}} of the early <b>tradition</b> <b>are</b> anonymous, another {{important}} name linked with this <b>tradition</b> <b>is</b> Song Yu, who, like Qu Yuan, {{was a native of}} Chu, traditionally thought to have been wrongfully and mistakenly dismissed from court despite possessing both great talents and loyalty.|$|R
50|$|Crying The Neck is {{a harvest}} festival {{tradition}} practised in the Duchy of Cornwall, Britain. The <b>tradition</b> <b>was</b> also once {{popular in the}} county of Devon, but its practice there has since died out.

5000|$|The <b>tradition</b> <b>is</b> an {{important}} ethnic marker of Serb identity. Serbs usually regard the Slava as their most significant and most solemn feast day. The <b>tradition</b> <b>is</b> also very well preserved among the Serb worldwide. Apart from Serbs, the custom is also practised by some Orthodox Macedonian families.|$|R
5|$|Chad is a religiously diverse country. The 1993 census {{found that}} 54% of Chadians were Muslim (of these, {{according}} to a Pew report 48% professed to be Sunni, 21% Shia, 4% Ahmadi and 23% just Muslim). Roughly 20% of Chadians are Roman Catholic, 14% Protestant, 10% animist, while 3% did not profess any religion. None of these religious <b>traditions</b> <b>are</b> monolithic. Animism includes a variety of ancestor and place-oriented religions whose expression is highly specific. Islam is expressed in diverse ways; for example, according to the Pew report mentioned earlier 55% of Muslim Chadians belong to Sufi orders. Christianity arrived in Chad with the French and American missionaries; as with Chadian Islam, it syncretises aspects of pre-Christian religious beliefs. Muslims are largely concentrated in northern and eastern Chad, and animists and Christians live primarily in southern Chad and Guéra. The constitution provides for a secular state and guarantees religious freedom; different religious communities generally co-exist without problems.|$|E
5|$|Easter Island has {{the richest}} {{assortment}} of petroglyphs in Polynesia. Nearly every suitable surface has been carved, including {{the stone walls}} of some houses {{and a few of}} the famous mo‘ai statues and their fallen topknots. Around one thousand sites with over four thousand glyphs have been catalogued, some in bas- or sunken-relief, and some painted red and white. Designs include a concentration of chimeric bird-man figures at Orongo, a ceremonial center of the tangata manu ("bird-man") cult; faces of the creation deity Makemake; marine animals like turtles, tuna, swordfish, sharks, whales, dolphins, crabs, and octopi (some with human faces); roosters; canoes, and over five hundred komari (vulvas). Petroglyphs are often accompanied by carved divots ("cupules") in the rock. Changing <b>traditions</b> <b>are</b> preserved in bas-relief birdmen, which were carved over simpler outline forms and in turn carved over with komari. Although the petroglyphs cannot be directly dated, some are partially obscured by pre-colonial stone buildings, suggesting they are relatively old.|$|E
5|$|Many {{classical}} dance {{forms and}} folk art are practised in the city. The Yakshagana, a night-long dance and drama performance, {{is held in}} Mangalore, while Pilivesha (literally, tiger dance), a folk dance unique to the city, is performed during Dasara and Krishna Janmashtami. Karadi Vesha (literally, bear dance) is another well known dance performed during Dasara. Paddanas (Ballad-like epics passed on through generations by word of mouth) are sung by a community of impersonators in Tulu and are usually accompanied by the rhythmic drum beats. The Bearys' unique <b>traditions</b> <b>are</b> reflected in such folk songs as kolkai (sung during kolata, a valour folk-dance during which sticks used as props), unjal pat (traditional lullaby), moilanji pat, and oppune pat (sung at weddings). The Evkaristik Purshanv (Konkani: Eucharistic procession) is an annual Catholic religious procession led on the first Sunday of each year. The Shreemanti Bai Memorial Government Museum in Bejai is the only museum in Mangalore.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Tradition</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} key {{concepts}} in anthropology; {{it can be said that}} anthropology is the study of [...] "tradition in traditional societies".

50|$|Franco's Spanish {{nationalism}} {{promoted a}} unitary national identity by repressing Spain's cultural diversity. Bullfighting and flamenco were promoted as national traditions, while those traditions not considered Spanish were suppressed. Franco's view of Spanish <b>tradition</b> <b>was</b> somewhat artificial and arbitrary: while some regional <b>traditions</b> <b>were</b> suppressed, Flamenco, an Andalusian <b>tradition,</b> <b>was</b> {{considered part of}} a larger, national identity. All cultural activities were subject to censorship, and many were forbidden entirely, often in an erratic manner. This cultural policy relaxed over time, most notably in the late 1960s and early 1970s.|$|R
