5|$|As the company's only engineer, Bristow rapidly {{developed}} a prototype himself before turning the game over to new hire Lyle Rains {{to develop into}} a finished product, codenamed K2 Tank. Rains added the maze and central minefield to the game design and developed the final hardware, including the simple control scheme. Peter Takaichi designed a large custom cabinet to house it. Tank {{was one of the}} first games to use integrated circuit-based memory—specifically, mask ROM (read-only memory)—to store graphical data, rather than the diode arrays that previous arcade games used; it is sometimes claimed in sources <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> first, but was preceded at minimum by Atari's Gran Trak 10 (1974). Integrated circuit-based memory thereafter became the standard for arcade and console video games. Before the game could be completed, in September 1974 Atari announced plans to merge itself and Kee Games back together; Tank was released that November just prior to the merger in December 1974.|$|E

2500|$|In David Gordon's dances, simple {{movement}} phrases are reiterated until {{what you}} notice <b>is</b> not <b>the</b> movement itself but the distinctiveness {{of the bodies}} of the performers. Gordon's genius lies both in his choice of dancers, most noticeably his wife and longtime collaborator Valda Setterfield, and in his gestural vocabulary. Also, his use of language underscores the message of his dances, which <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> body's actions and signals, like words, can change their meaning depending on their context. The phrasing of Gordon's movements is uninflected, fluid, tending to slide comfortably through the memory, so that what you want to pay attention <b>to</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> manner in which these particular interesting figures do whatever it is they are doing.

25|$|The first {{congregation}} {{is mainly}} {{represented by the}} urban area population and emerged {{during the period of}} the Republic of Turkey. For many decades, this group of people belonged to the political left and presumed the Aleviness just as an outlook on the individual human life rather than a religious conviction by persistently renouncing the ties of the Batiniyya-Alevism with Twelver political branch of Shia Islam. The followers of this congregation, who later turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> stern defenders of the Erdoğan Çınar hold ritual unions of a religious character and have established cultural associations named after Pir Sultan Abdal as well.

25|$|The first {{internal}} combustion piston engine design to be widely used for powering aircraft was the Antoinette water-cooled V8 engine, believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> first V-form eight-cylinder {{internal combustion}} engine ever placed in production, designed by the Frenchman Léon Levavasseur. The Antoinette 8V incorporated direct fuel injection, evaporative water cooling and other advanced features, weighed 95kg (209lb) and produced 37kW (50hp). Introduced in 1906, these engines were used by, among others, Santos Dumont, the early Voisin aircraft and Samuel Cody. American aviation engine designers quickly {{picked up on the}} V-8 engine concept from 1906 onwards as the era progressed, with both Glenn Curtiss' firm designing a series of liquid-cooled V-8 aviation engines culminating in the Curtiss OX-5 by the early years of World War I — another major American engine manufacturer, Hall-Scott, had their A-2 and A-3 overhead valve, liquid-cooled V-8s in production as early as 1908.|$|E
25|$|Analysts and pollsters offered {{different}} opinions on whether smaller extraparliamentary parties had chances to enter parliament or not. According to some pollsters, the FRITZ had very good {{chances of getting}} into parliament, and the LIF with its founder Schmidt as its leading candidate, as well; the conditions were {{as good as they}} had never been before for smaller parties, according to some. Analysts agreed that apart from LIF and FRITZ, all others would fail to enter parliament. Analysts furthermore asserted that the candidacy of the FRITZ would likely make the race for third place between Greens and FPÖ very competitive, as the FRITZ would likely gain protest votes which would otherwise go to the FPÖ. The critical time for the extraparliamentary parties was stated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> first phase of the campaign, when the larger parties had not yet really started campaigning and the smaller parties had a chance to gain publicity.|$|E
25|$|Harris {{was soon}} moving again, sailing to Portugal to {{participate}} in the opening actions of the British involvement in the Peninsular War. Harris was at the very first action, a skirmish at the town of Óbidos, where he saw Lieutenant Ralph Bunbury fall, the first British casualty of the war. On 17 August 1808 he was in the hotly contested skirmish line at Battle of Rolica, and saw serious opposition for the first time, reporting it as an exhilarating and terrifying experience. Many of his companions were killed at this action and the ensuing Battle of Vimeiro, but Harris remained unhurt, continuing the march to Salamanca before becoming trapped in northern Spain with the rest of Sir John Moore's army. The Light Brigade of Robert Craufurd, which included the 2nd/95th, did not march {{with the rest of the}} army to Corunna but marched to Vigo. The sights and horrors of the march remained with him for decades to come, and he was lucky to escape, claiming <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> last man collected from the beaches at Vigo, and embarking for England in a severely weakened state.|$|E

25|$|Hoover entered Stanford University in 1891, its inaugural year, {{after failing}} all the {{entrance}} exams (except mathematics) {{and then being}} tutored for the summer in Palo Alto. Hoover claimed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> first student at Stanford, by virtue of having been {{the first person in}} the first class to sleep in the dormitory. Hoover worked a variety of odd jobs to support himself, and struggled in many of his classes, especially English. But he found a happiness at Stanford that previously eluded him. Hoover had been unsure of his major before arriving at Stanford, but position working for geologist John Casper Branner convinced him to switch his major to geology, and Hoover interned for Branner and the United States Geological Survey during the summer. Though he was shy among fellow students at first, Hoover won election as student treasurer and became known for his distaste for fraternities and sororities. In his senior year, he became smitten with a classmate named Lou Henry, but his financial situation precluded the possibility of marriage. Hoover graduated from Stanford in 1895, {{in the midst of the}} Panic of 1893, and initially struggled to find a job.|$|E
500|$|Goya {{does not}} focus on {{the reasons for the}} shortage, nor does he {{apportion}} blame to any one party. Instead, he is concerned only with its effect on the population. Although the images in the group were based on the experience of Madrid, none of the scenes depict specific events, and there are no identifiable buildings to place the scenes. Goya's focus is on the darkened masses of dead and barely alive bodies, men carrying corpses of women, and bereaved children mourning for lost parents. Hughes believes , Madre infeliz! (Unhappy mother!), to be the most powerful and poignant of the group. He suggests that the space between the small girl sobbing and the corpse of her mother represents [...] "a darkness that seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> essence of loss and orphanhood". This group of plates was probably completed by early 1814. A scarcity of materials during the famine may have accounted for the freer application of aquatint in these prints; Goya was sometimes forced to use defective plates or reuse old plates after they were burnished.|$|E
500|$|Poe chose a raven as {{the central}} symbol in the story because he wanted a [...] "non-reasoning" [...] {{creature}} capable of speech. He decided on a raven, which he considered [...] "equally capable of speech" [...] as a parrot, because it matched the intended tone of the poem. Poe said the raven is meant to symbolize [...] "Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance". He was also inspired by Grip, the raven in [...] by Charles Dickens. One scene in particular bears a resemblance to [...] "The Raven": {{at the end of}} the fifth chapter of Dickens's novel, Grip makes a noise and someone says, [...] "What was that– him tapping at the door?" [...] The response is, [...] "'Tis someone knocking softly at the shutter." [...] Dickens's raven could speak many words and had many comic turns, including the popping of a champagne cork, but Poe emphasized the bird's more dramatic qualities. Poe had written a review of Barnaby Rudge for Graham's Magazine saying, among other things, that the raven should have served a more symbolic, prophetic purpose. The similarity did not go unnoticed: James Russell Lowell in his A Fable for Critics wrote the verse, [...] "Here comes Poe with his raven, like Barnaby Rudge / Three-fifths of him genius and two-fifths sheer fudge." [...] The Free Library of Philadelphia has on display a taxidermied raven that is reputed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> one that Dickens owned and that helped inspire Poe's poem.|$|E
