5|$|At 4:00p.m., two {{anti-tank}} teams {{joined the}} Sa'iqa {{company on the}} firing ramp. Both teams, along with the company, were ordered to advance eastward and seize the crossroads. At around 5:00p.m., the Israeli Air Force began attacking Egyptian forces in the fort and on <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canal. One group of four aircraft attempted to bomb the fort; the first aircraft dropped its payload of seven bombs, then descended to a low altitude to escape anti-aircraft fire. An anti-air platoon at the Kilometer 17 mark soon shot down an Israeli aircraft (either a Mirage III or an A-4 Skyhawk) with a Strela 2 missile, destroying it. Between 6:00 and 7:00p.m. all bunkers and troop shelters inside the fort were cleared, and the Egyptians transferred 26 Israeli prisoners to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canal, and thereafter transferred them to Port Said for intelligence gathering. The Israelis concentrated heavy artillery fire against the fort, once they were sure it had been captured by the Egyptians.|$|E

5|$|The Rhine Campaign of 1795 had {{concluded}} with an armistice. On 20 May 1796, the Austrians notified the French that the truce would end on 1 June. The minute it expired, Kléber led two divisions across the armistice line heading south toward Charles' right wing. The French beat the Duke of Württemberg in the Battle of Altenkirchen on 4 June, capturing 3,000 Austrians, four colors and 12 guns. By 6 June Kléber's wing {{was on the}} Lahn River and Archduke Charles began evacuating <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rhine in order to concentrate against the French incursion. Kléber was joined {{within a few days}} by Jourdan and most of the Army of the Sambre-et-Meuse.
