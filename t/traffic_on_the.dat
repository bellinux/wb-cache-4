5|$|Although much of {{the upper}} reaches are now {{designated}} as leisure routes, there is still significant commercial <b>traffic</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> navigation. 300,000 tons were carried in 2007, {{although most of the}} traffic is now petroleum and gravel, rather than the coal which kept the navigation profitable for 150 years.|$|E
5|$|The last {{tower is}} the cannon tower. It {{has only one}} floor and is the {{shortest}} of all ten towers. It was built with an eight-sided base and cannon ports to help control <b>traffic</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Danube.

5|$|This issue, {{which became}} a serious {{bottleneck}} when <b>traffic</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> new expressway greatly exceeded expectations, was remedied beginning in 2001 {{with the construction of}} two flyovers to replace the problematic movements and the removal of the under-utilized connection from eastbound Mohawk Road to westbound Highway403. The $16 million project was completed in late 2002.|$|E
5|$|A {{new line}} to Rodeløkka was opened on 3 January 1955. The bus {{operation}} {{had been more}} expensive than the tram, and a double track line was built from Carl Berners plass through Dælenenggata to Rodeløkka. The balloon loop was built around the block of Dælenengata, Fagerheimgata, Marstrandgata and Københavngata. The line was connected to the old Rodeløkka Line with a triangular loop in Københavngata. On 23 April 1961, all <b>traffic</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Rodeløkka Line was terminated. The tracks were removed between 1962 and 1964.|$|E
5|$|A new {{main drain}} to Wiggenhall St Germans was {{completed}} in 1848, which provided better drainage because the outfall was lower than that at Salters Lode. Whittlesey Mere, the last remaining lake, was drained soon afterwards, {{using one of the}} first applications of John Appold's centrifugal pump, following its appearance at the Great Exhibition in 1851. <b>Traffic</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> network began to diminish after the opening of the railway through March in 1846, and fell dramatically in the early twentieth century. The last regular commercial traffic was the tanker barge Shellfen, which delivered fuel oil to pumping stations until 1971.|$|E

5|$|A third bore of the tunnel, {{replacing}} the old Victorian northbound bore, was proposed by Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson in 1989, but {{had yet to}} see any progress towards construction over a decade later. This option is not currently favoured by TfL due to technical problems with construction and engineering, difficulty tying in with the existing road network, and concern about increased <b>traffic</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> A12.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{government}} of Tamaulipas, most of the damage in the state was in farmland and in residents' dwellings, primarily near Matamoros, Valle Hermoso, Reynosa and San Fernando. In Matamoros, part of the city lost power and running water; in Valle Hermoso, two schools were damaged; in Reynosa, 180people were evacuated from low-lying areas in five districts of the city, while in San Fernando, the main highway through the city was closed, and <b>traffic</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bridge over the Conchos River was restricted to one lane.|$|E
5|$|Between 1994 and 1998, {{there was}} local {{political}} debate about how Rikshospitalet, that {{was moving to}} Gaustad, should be served by public transport. The state wanted to extend the Ullevål Hageby Line of the tramway to the new hospital, while many local politicians {{wanted to use the}} rapid transit. Since the Ring Line would increase <b>traffic</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Songsvann Line, moving the line was considered to better serve the hospital. In 1998, an agreement was reached whereby the light rail line would be built, and a new station for transfer from the metro would open at Forskningsparken.|$|E

5|$|By 1960 the {{population}} of Pitkin County had increased by 44%, the second-fastest growth rate on the Western Slope. The Aspen Skiing Company built two additional resorts, Buttermilk and Snowmass, to the west, contributing to <b>traffic</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> highway. In 1962 the Colorado Department of Highways, began a 12-year project to expand Highway 82 to four lanes between Glenwood Springs and Carbondale. The Maroon Creek Bridge was widened in 1963 to handle its increased traffic.|$|E
5|$|Construction, {{such as the}} North-South Arterial Highway project, {{supports}} the public-sector job market. Although passenger and commercial <b>traffic</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Erie Canal has declined greatly since the 19thcentury, the barge canal still allows heavy cargo to travel through Utica at low cost, bypassing the New York State Thruway and providing intermodal freight transport with the railroads.|$|E
5|$|East of Washington Street and Saginaw Road, {{the highway}} {{transitions}} from one-way streets to a freeway; the transition between the eastbound freeway and Patrick Road {{passes through a}} roundabout in the Saginaw Road interchange. As the freeway continues eastward, there is a partial interchange for Waldo Road, and then the highway crosses into the section of Midland that is located in Bay County. Immediately east of the county line, Bus. US10 and M-20 jointly terminate at a directional interchange with US10; <b>traffic</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastbound business loop defaults onto eastbound US10, and <b>traffic</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> westbound business loop originates on westbound US10. According to the Michigan Department of Transportation, the agency which maintains the roadway, between 7,317 and 23,733vehicles per day used the business loop on average daily in 2013. The section of Bus. US10 that runs concurrently with M-20 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

5|$|Fort Abercrombie {{was built}} in 1858 on the Red River at {{what is now the}} border between Minnesota and North Dakota near modern McCauleyville. The fort had to be moved soon {{afterward}} because of flooding problems. It was created to spur settlement of the Red River Valley, protect steamboat <b>traffic</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> river, and protect wagon trains travelling to Montana.|$|E
5|$|Freight {{trains to}} the various {{industrial}} companies along the line remained until the 1980s, when traffic sank drastically. From 1988, the line was closed from Foss-Eigeland, although the line from there to Ganddal was kept for use for a cement factory. Until 2001 only the three first kilometers (two first miles) of the line were used, for transport of concrete structures, but then the Norwegian National Rail Administration stopped all <b>traffic</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line.|$|E
