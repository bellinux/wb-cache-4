50|$|There are two subspecies, <b>Thalassornis</b> <b>leuconotus</b> leuconotus and <b>Thalassornis</b> <b>leuconotus</b> insularis. The latter lives {{entirely on}} Madagascar and is {{considered}} endangered {{as a result of}} hunting, habitat loss and the introduction of competing exotic species.|$|E
50|$|The {{white-backed duck}} (<b>Thalassornis</b> <b>leuconotus)</b> is a waterbird {{of the family}} Anatidae. It is {{distinct}} from all other ducks, but most {{closely related to the}} whistling ducks in the subfamily Dendrocygninae, though also showing some similarities to the stiff-tailed ducks in the subfamily Oxyurinae. It is {{the only member of the}} genus Thalassornis.|$|E
5000|$|Eight {{species of}} {{whistling}} duck are currently {{recognized in the}} genus Dendrocygna. However, Johnsgard considers the white-backed duck (<b>Thalassornis</b> <b>leuconotus)</b> from Africa and Madagascar to be distinct ninth species, a view first proposed in 1960 and initially supported by behavioral similarities. Later, similarities in anatomy, duckling vocalizations, and feather proteins gave additional support. Molecular analysis in 2009 also suggested that the white-backed duck was nested within the whistling duck clade. In addition to the [...] species, subfossil remains of an extinct, undescribed species have been found on Aitutaki of the Cook Islands.|$|E
40|$|Ten wildfowl taxa are {{resident}} in Madagascar including four endemics: Madagascar White-backed Duck <b>Thalassornis</b> <b>leuconotus</b> insularis, Madagascar Teal Anas bernieri, Meller’s Duck A. melleri and Madagascar Pochard Aythya innotata. These endemic duck taxa were amongst the last wildfowl forms {{to be described}} in Africa and are undoubtedly currently the rarest in this region. The history of our knowledge of these birds follows four easily definable stages: discovery, understanding, protection and the future. The new millennium has started with a much more detailed understanding of the four ducks ’ ecology than ever before, the protection of several key sites and the re-discovery in 2006 of the Madagascar Pochard. The next few years will tell if the ducks have a more secure future and, while not yet safe, Madagascar’s ducks are perhaps now among the better known of Africa’s endemic wildfowl. Key words: endemic, Madagascar, protection, status review, wildfowl. Madagascar has ten extant species of wildfowl (Anatidae) with a further two species (of sheldgeese) Centrornis majori and Alopochen sirabensis known only from sub-fossil remains (Table 1) (Young et al. 2003; Young & Kear 2006). The extant taxa include three full endemic species and an endemic subspecies with varied geographical origins: two species – Madagascar Teal Anas bernieri and Madagascar Pochard Aythya innotata – are of Australo/Asian origins, and two others...|$|E
40|$|Whistling ducks {{comprise}} {{a group of}} nine species that are primarily of tropical and subtropical distribution. In common with the swans and true geese (which with them comprise the subfamily Anserinae), the included species have a reticulated tarsal surface pattern, lack sexual dimorphism in plumage, produce vocalizations that are similar or identical in both sexes, form relatively permanent pair bonds, and lack complex pair-forming behavior patterns. Unlike the geese and swans, whistling ducks have clear, often melodious whistling voices that are the basis for their group name. The alternative name, tree ducks, is far less appropriate, since few of the species regularly perch or nest in trees. All the species have relatively long legs and large feet that extend beyond the fairly short tail when the birds are in flight. They dive well, and some species obtain much of their food in this manner. Eight species are represented in the genus Dendrocygna, including {{all three of the}} species included in this book. A ninth species, the African and Madagascan white-backed duck (<b>Thalassornis</b> <b>leuconotus),</b> is considered by the author (Johnsgard, 1966) to be an aberrant whistling duck. Two of the three species included in this book regularly nest in the southern United States, while the third (the Cuban whistling duck) might be regarded as North American {{on the basis of its}} occurrence in the West Indies, although it is not known to have ever reached continental North America...|$|E
