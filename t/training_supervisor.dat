40|$|Objective Although competency-based <b>training</b> of <b>supervisors</b> is now {{compulsory}} in many countries, {{there has}} been limited evidenced-based literature to guide the profession as to the most effective ways of <b>training</b> <b>supervisors.</b> The aim of the current pilot {{study was to examine}} the effects of a <b>supervisor</b> <b>training</b> program on <b>supervisor,</b> supervisee, and evaluator perceptions of supervisory competence. Method Ten female and two male supervisors employed by a state-wide counselling service participated in the study. Data, including taped supervision sessions relating to supervisor, supervisee, and evaluator perceptions of supervisory competence, skill, and process were collected at three time points; two prior to a <b>supervisor</b> <b>training</b> program and one following the program. Results The evaluator observed significant improvements in supervisory competence from pre- to post-training. Although supervisors reported no significant change in competence as a result of training, they did report areas of positive changes in supervisory practice. Across time supervisors also reported a significant decrease in their perception of the supervisor–supervisee alliance on one measure, but this was not noted by the evaluator or supervisee, or on other measures of supervisory alliance. Conclusions Evaluator ratings of supervisor competency and qualitative supervisor feedback provide preliminary support for the effectiveness of <b>supervisor</b> <b>training.</b> However, the pilot study was underpowered and some of the measures require further psychometric testing, which will need to be addressed in future research.

40|$|The need {{to enhance}} the {{research}} profile of accounting departments and schools of accounting at South African universities and {{to increase the number}} of students engaging in postgraduate studies mirrors the challenges faced by universities in Australia and the United Kingdom two decades ago. Coupled with these imperatives is the recognition of the need for <b>supervisor</b> <b>training</b> in accounting departments and schools of accounting and the lack of opportunities for gaining experience in postgraduate research supervision due to the small number of students in the accounting field wishing to undertake research-based studies. This article reviews relevant literature on <b>training</b> for the <b>supervisors</b> of postgraduate research students, documents the personal experience and observations of the writer and, drawing on these sources, makes recommendations for the <b>training</b> of <b>supervisors.</b> The recommendations include a model for the <b>training</b> of <b>supervisors</b> reflecting two perspectives: “on-the-job” training and the introduction of a departmental supervision guide setting out aspects of best practice.

40|$|University {{supervisors}} {{of student}} teachers are often undertrained {{as to how}} to complete in-class observations. This project examined the effects of video training to improve the accuracy of university supervisors’ in-class observations. Participants were student teacher supervisors from various locations across the state who provide supervision for a local university in the Western U. S., and the university student teachers they supervised. Target behaviors included data collection on praise rate, percentage of specific praise, and opportunities for students to respond. The findings suggest that following training the participants collected data with varying results with some areas of high accuracy and others with less accuracy. The participants rated the social validity of <b>supervisor</b> <b>training</b> high. Additionally, the effects of video training somewhat generalized to in-class observations by the university supervisor but may be improved by enhancing the video training and providing feedback following the training videos. Results of this study indicate the importance of <b>training</b> university <b>supervisors</b> to complete in-class observations with accuracy. These results also support the use of standardized video <b>training</b> to <b>train</b> <b>supervisors...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background & Objectives: According to {{previous}} researches, workers' participation in issues affecting their working condition {{is the key}} to success in ergonomics interventions in working environments. Therefore, the present study was performed to increase active particapitation of supervisors in production line and also to identify and assess ergonomics risks and presenting modification actions (Kaizen) by themselves in Pars Khodro automobile manufacturing company. Methods: A manual regarding lifting objects and body postures, according to the Finish evaluation method, was provided for supervisors in production line and related trainings were presented to them. Then, they were asked to insert the results of their assessments and suggestions in special forms during one year. The presented assessments and suggestions were examined by ergonomics experts. Results: According to the assessments conducted by supervisors, 26 work stations had high ergonomics risks, 51 had ergonomics risks with an average level, and 45 had low ergonomics risks. Moreover, the number of required Kaizens presented by supervisors was increased from 18 cases in the first year to 42 cases in the second year, after implementation of ergonomics training and identifying and assessing ergonomic risks by supervisors. Conclusion: Empowering and <b>training</b> <b>supervisors</b> increased workers' participation.

40|$|In the UK the {{literature}} on supervision {{within the field of}} systemic psychotherapy is not extensive, and very little research is published. In particular {{there is a lack of}} empirical material available that explores how <b>training</b> <b>supervisors</b> work. This study focused on how supervisors develop reflexive abilities in systemic psychotherapy students, and in particular on the nature of their experience whilst doing this work. Semi-structured interviews with three experienced supervisors were conducted and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The Supervisory Relationship emerged from the analysis as a single overarching theme which contained and contextualised three further themes: Promoting Learning, Dimensions of Power, and The Self of the Supervisor. One aspect of the analysis is reported here, The Self of the Supervisor, via a presentation of two of its supporting components, The Developmental Journey of the Supervisor and Challenges to the Supervisor’s Sense of Self. Formative experiences in training and powerful interactions with students were both found to impact significantly on the supervisory self. This study adds richness and detail to the published material on supervisory experience, and points to the need for greater levels of support for <b>training</b> <b>supervisors.</b> The findings are discussed in the context of current literature and research regarding supervision and training in systemic psychotherapy.
