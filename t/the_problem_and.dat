5|$|For all his overmastering zeal, Bernard was {{by nature}} neither a bigot nor a persecutor. As in the First Crusade, the preaching {{inadvertently}} led to attacks on Jews; a fanatical French monk named Rudolf was apparently inspiring massacres of Jews in the Rhineland, Cologne, Mainz, Worms and Speyer, with Rudolf claiming Jews were not contributing financially {{to the rescue}} of the Holy Land. Bernard, the Archbishop of Cologne and the Archbishop of Mainz were vehemently opposed to these attacks, and so Bernard traveled from Flanders to Germany to deal with <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> quiet the mobs. Bernard then found Rudolf in Mainz and was able to silence him, returning him to his monastery.|$|E
5|$|In October 2010, her {{government}} {{announced that it}} would open two detention centres for 2000 immigrants, due to the pressures in allowing women and children to be released into the community. One was to be opened in Inverbrackie, South Australia, and one in Northam, Western Australia. She said it would be a short-term solution to <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> that temporary detention centres would be closed.|$|E
5|$|Like the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, Guangzhou also {{attempted}} {{to raise the}} air quality of the city. The authority had pledged ￥600 million to fight <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>and</b> had ordered around 32 chemical plants to stop production {{by the end of}} 2009. A report shown on July 13, 2010 indicates that the air quality was rated at 95.07% in 2009, an increase of 12.01% since 2004; this improvement eventually cost authorities ￥24 billion. Later action from organisers to curb the pollution included decreasing the movement of vehicles up to 40 percent and banning barbecue stalls in 11 cities.|$|E

5|$|Media {{attention}} {{centred on}} sabotage, while other speculation ranged from clear-air turbulence to {{an explosion of}} vapour in an empty fuel tank. The Abell Committee focused on six potential aerodynamic and mechanical causes: control flutter (which had led {{to the loss of}} DH 108 prototypes), structural failure due to high loads or metal fatigue of the wing structure, failure of the powered flight controls, failure of the window panels leading to explosive decompression, or fire and other engine problems. The committee concluded that fire was the most likely cause of <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>and</b> a number of changes were made to the aircraft to protect the engines and wings from damage that might lead to another fire.|$|E
5|$|Not all parallelization {{results in}} speed-up. Generally, as a task is split up into {{more and more}} threads, those threads spend an {{ever-increasing}} portion of their time communicating with each other. Eventually, the overhead from communication dominates the time spent solving <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>and</b> further parallelization (that is, splitting the workload over even more threads) increases rather than decreases {{the amount of time}} required to finish. This is known as parallel slowdown.|$|E

5|$|On October 17, 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries {{announced}} an oil embargo against the United States {{in retaliation for}} its support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Because the United States imported approximately 35 percent of its oil from foreign sources, the embargo had a major effect. The price of gasoline shot upward, gasoline shortages were common, and rationing was considered. Most Americans began demanding a solution to <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>and</b> President Richard Nixon began lobbying for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline as at least {{a part of the}} answer.|$|E
5|$|The Three Mile Island {{power station}} is near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in the United States. The {{accident}} described in Three Mile Island began on Wednesday, March 28, 1979, and ultimately {{resulted in a}} partial core meltdown in Unit 2 of the nuclear power plant. Unit 2's pressurized water reactor was of 900 MWe capacity. The scope and complexity of this reactor accident became clear {{over the course of}} five days, as a number of agencies at the local, state and federal levels tried to solve <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> decide whether the ongoing accident required an emergency evacuation, and to what extent.|$|E
5|$|The Tu-70 was {{completed}} in October 1946, but did not make its first flight until 27 November. It began manufacturer's trials in October, but an engine fire on the fourth flight caused it to make a crash-landing. This was traced to a design defect in the American-built supercharger-control system, but identifying <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> fixing it prolonged the manufacturer's trials through October 1947. It was redesignated as the Tu-70 when it went through the State acceptance trials which ended on 14 December. It met all the design goals, but was not accepted for production as all the factories were already committed to building aircraft with a higher priority and Aeroflot had no requirement for the type, being fully satisfied with its existing Lisunov Li-2 and Ilyushin Il-12 airliners.|$|E

5|$|The {{most likely}} {{cause of the}} {{accident}} {{seemed to be that}} the fireworks attached to her balloon had been knocked out of position by a tree as she ascended; possibly the balloon was heavily loaded and failed to rise quickly enough. When she had lit the fuses the fireworks headed towards the balloon instead of away from it; one of them burned a hole in the fabric, igniting the gas. One man reportedly spotted <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> shouted to her not to light the fuses, but his cries were drowned out by the cheering of the crowd. Later reports suggested she had left the gas valve open, allowing sparks to ignite the gas and set fire to the balloon, or that her balloon was of poor construction and allowed gas to escape throughout the ascent.|$|E

The doctors discovered that he had ruptured an important blood vessel and immediate surgery was needed to fix it. The operation failed to fix <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>and</b> he died early in the morning on 10 February 1962. His son, Michael, succeeded him as Baron Birkett.|$|E
5|$|The person's {{understanding}} {{of his or}} her mental illness is evaluated by exploring his or her explanatory account of <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>and</b> {{understanding of}} the treatment options. In this context, insight can be said to have three components: recognition that one has a mental illness, compliance with treatment, and the ability to re-label unusual mental events (such as delusions and hallucinations) as pathological. As insight is on a continuum, the clinician should not describe it as simply present or absent, but should report the patient's explanatory account descriptively.|$|E

5|$|The route {{has existed}} as a {{railroad}} corridor {{since the turn}} of the 20th century. A highway known as the Julian road was built by 1913, and was designated as Legislative Route198 in the state highway system by 1935. Route198 was renumbered SR67 in the 1964 state highway renumbering. A freeway south of Lakeside was built in the late 1960s, and opened to traffic in 1970. Since then, the portion of the highway north of Lakeside has become known for a high number of traffic accidents and related fatalities. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has made several attempts to remedy <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> make the road safer.|$|E

5|$|Alice {{spent her}} {{childhood}} between Darmstadt, London, Jugenheim, and Malta (where her naval officer father was occasionally stationed). Her mother {{noticed that she}} was slow in learning to talk, and became concerned by her indistinct pronunciation. Eventually, {{she was diagnosed with}} congenital deafness after her grandmother identified <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> took her to see an ear specialist. With encouragement from her mother, Alice learned to both lip-read and speak in English and German. Educated privately, she studied French, and later, after her engagement, she learned Greek. Her early years were spent in the company of her royal relatives, and she was a bridesmaid at the marriage of George, Duke of York (later King George V) and Mary of Teck in 1893. A few weeks before her sixteenth birthday she attended the funeral of Queen Victoria in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and shortly afterward she was confirmed in the Anglican faith.|$|E
5|$|British aero engines were {{normally}} {{equipped with}} a power take-off shaft {{that led to the}} rear of the engine. In twin engine aircraft like the Anson, one of these would be used for a generator that powered the aircraft instruments at 24V DC, the other would be left unconnected and available for use. Following a suggestion from Watt to avoid Air Ministry channels, in October Bowen flew one of the Battles to the Metropolitan-Vickers (Metrovick) plant in Sheffield, where he pulled the DC generator off the engine, dropped it on the table, and asked for an AC alternator of similar size and shape. Arnold Tustin, Metrovick's lead engineer, was called in to consider <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>and</b> after a few minutes he returned to say that he could supply an 80V unit at 1200 to 2400Hz and 800W, even better than the 500W requested. Bowen had an order for 18 pre-production units placed as soon as possible, and the first units started arriving at the end of October. A second order for 400 more quickly followed. Eventually about 133,800 of these alternators would be produced during the war.|$|E
5|$|Cley {{and nearby}} Blakeney had been prosperous and {{important}} ports in the Middle Ages, but land reclamation schemes, especially those by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 {{just to the}} west of Cley, led to the silting up of the shipping channel and relocation of the wharf. Further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>and</b> also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former tidal channel to the Salthouse marshes to the east of Cley. In an attempt to halt the decline, Thomas Telford was consulted in 1822, but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented, and by 1840 almost all of Cley's trade had been lost to Blakeney and other Norfolk ports. The population stagnated, and the value of all property decreased sharply. In the mid-nineteenth century, the Lord of the Manor constructed the present road to the beach in exchange for closing the ancient right of way across the marshes.|$|E
