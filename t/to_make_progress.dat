5|$|After {{the scale}} of the damage became clear, the {{government}} of Yemen requested for assistance from the international community. The hardest hit areas had poor infrastructure, which caused difficulties in communications as relief goods were distributed. Nations in the region, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, sent money and supplies to help rebuild the damaged infrastructure and houses. Agencies under the United Nations provided food and logistical support. Relief efforts continued <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>progress</b> until 2011 due to a political uprising in Yemen.|$|E
5|$|An {{attempt to}} open a sealed chamber using a Borazon drill fails <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>progress.</b> However, a few moments after the drill is stopped, a small hole is seen, though the drill operator, Sladden (Duncan Lamont), is certain it was not created by his machine. The hole widens to reveal the corpses of three-legged, insectoid creatures with horned heads. Roney and Judd work to {{preserve}} the bodies before they decay. An examination of the creatures' physiology suggests {{they came from the}} planet Mars. Quatermass and Roney note the similarity between the appearance of the creatures and images of the Devil.|$|E

5|$|God by {{a sudden}} {{conversion}} subdued and brought my mind to a teachable frame, which was more hardened in such matters than {{might have been expected}} from one at my early period of life. Having thus received some taste and knowledge of true godliness, I was immediately inflamed with so intense a desire <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>progress</b> therein, that although I did not altogether leave off other studies, yet I pursued them with less ardour.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Juster had {{received}} a Ford Foundation grant for a children's book about cities. Unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>progress</b> on that project, he turned to writing what became The Phantom Tollbooth, his first book. His housemate, Feiffer, a cartoonist, interested himself in the project. Jason Epstein, an editor at Random House, bought the book and published it. The book received rave reviews and has sold in excess of three million copies, far more than expected. It has been adapted into a film, opera, and play, and translated into many languages.|$|E
5|$|Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors was {{developed}} by Chunsoft and directed by Kotaro Uchikoshi.

5|$|Potter {{intended}} to follow Mrs. Tittlemouse with a tale about a pig {{in a large}} format book similar to the original Ginger and Pickles. On one occasion, she passed an hour sketching inside the pig sty at Hill Top while the pig nibbled at her boots. She abandoned the pig book after fruitless attempts <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>progress</b> on it, and, instead, occupied the winter of 191011 with supervising the production of Peter Rabbit's Painting Book, and the composition of The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes.|$|E
5|$|The flag {{has also}} {{been used as a}} symbol of protest post-1994. In 2005, a statue of King Makhado was vandalised in Louis Trichardt with the colours of the flag as a protest against a {{proposal}} to change the name of the town to Makhado. Some South Africans in the 21st century started to fly the flag as a protest against a perceived failure of the ANC <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>progress</b> in governing South Africa as a democracy.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} von Falkenhayn, held his reserve force of 3rd Cavalry Division (Seventh Army's III Corps) and 19th Division (Eighth Army reserve) {{in front of}} Beit Jibrin. They waited {{throughout}} the day for the main attack <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>progress</b> before beginning their own advance, but the opportunity never eventuated. This powerful Ottoman counterattack had been contained and had not forced any rearrangement of the invading forces, whose preparations and concentration on the plain were now complete. But von Falkenhayn was forced to halt his Seventh Army's attack and then {{to take away from}} it the 16th Division plus one regiment.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1950s Waugh was troubled {{on a number}} of fronts. He was afflicted with writer's block, and was unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>progress</b> with his current novel, the second in his Sword of Honour trilogy. He had {{financial}} worries, a legacy of his free-spending post-war habits combined with accumulated tax liabilities and a lack of remunerative productivity. His general health was poor; he suffered from toothache, sciatica and rheumatism, and his memory was faulty. He was also drinking heavily, the effects of which were aggravated by a large intake of chloral and bromide washed down with crème de menthe—a treatment for insomnia that he concealed from his doctors.|$|E
5|$|On 29 June, Croatia and Slovenia {{agreed to}} suspend their {{declarations}} of independence to allow {{time for a}} negotiated settlement. The EC delegation appeared <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>progress</b> when Serbia responded to the move by ceasing {{their opposition to the}} appointment of a Croatian member of the federal presidency, Stjepan Mesić, as the body's chairman on 30 June. The appearance of a success was reinforced when the JNA ordered its troops posted in Slovenia to return to their barracks. On 1 July, de Michelis was replaced by João de Deus Pinheiro, the Portuguese foreign minister, to maintain the formula of current, former and future EC presidencies comprising the EC delegation as the Netherlands took over the presidency from Luxembourg, while Portugal was scheduled to assume the presidency after the Dutch.|$|E
5|$|The 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division resumed Operation Martlet at 0650, {{although}} much of its artillery support from VIII Corps was diverted to the main operation. The Germans were able to slow the British advance and then launched an armoured riposte. This initially gained ground but was stalled when British armour moved up and the two sides duelled in the confined terrain. Informed during the afternoon that a big British offensive was under way further east, SS-Standartenführer Kurt Meyer of 12th SS Panzer called off the counter-attack and ordered his tank companies {{to return to their}} positions south of Rauray. During {{the rest of the day}} the 49th Division was able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>progress,</b> eventually halting just north of Rauray.|$|E

5|$|As at Orsogna, the 18th Armoured Regiment {{was to play}} a {{supporting}} role in the forthcoming attack on Cassino, with the infantry of the 5th and 6th Brigades bearing {{the brunt of the}} battle. When the attack began on 15 March, the regiment was initially held as a reserve, ready to exploit any breakthrough by the infantry but this did not eventuate. The infantry struggled <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>progress</b> in the face of determined resistance. The regiment's tanks were first used at Cassino as artillery support for two weeks, each squadron being rotated in three-day stints to a position overlooking the town. Then in mid-April, one squadron was detached to remain on the Cassino front while the other two squadrons were withdrawn for training. The regiment remained fragmented into May, for once training was completed, another squadron was detached and sent into Cassino itself to man tanks which had been effectively set up as pillboxes.|$|E
5|$|As at Orsogna, the 20th Armoured Regiment {{was to play}} a {{supporting}} role in the forthcoming Cassino attack, with the infantry of the 5th and 6th Brigades bearing {{the brunt of the}} battle. When the attack began on 15 March, the regiment was initially held as a reserve, ready to exploit any breakthrough by the infantry but this did not eventuate. The infantry struggled <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>progress</b> in the face of determined resistance. Over the next week, some of the squadrons of the regiment became involved in small scale raid actions. On 24 March, the regiment moved into the area of Cassino controlled by the New Zealand infantry, and essentially became mobile pillboxes. The tanks were vulnerable to artillery and German patrols and the troops of the various squadrons of the regiment were rotated {{in and out of the}} town in two day shifts. While the New Zealand infantry had been relieved by the Guards Brigade in the early April, the 20th Armoured Regiment stayed in the line until the end of the month.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} phase of the operation, the 17th Infantry Brigade {{exploited}} the breach made in the perimeter, and pressed south as far as a secondary line of defences known as the Switch Line. On the second day, the 16th Infantry Brigade captured the township of Bardia, cutting the fortress in two. Thousands of prisoners were taken, and the Italian garrison now held out only in the northern and southernmost parts of the fortress. On the third day, the 19th Infantry Brigade advanced south from Bardia, supported by artillery and the Matilda tanks, now reduced in number to just six. Its advance allowed the 17th Infantry Brigade <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>progress</b> as well, and the two brigades reduced the southern sector of the fortress. Meanwhile, the Italian garrisons in the north surrendered to the 16th Infantry Brigade and the Support Group of the British 7th Armoured Division outside the fortress. In all, some 36,000 Italian prisoners were taken.|$|E

5|$|Logan and Mac {{continue}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>progress</b> on {{his business}} school report, but Mac has to call Max (Adam Rose) to continue. Desmond goes skinny dipping at his party, while Mac and Max flirt {{in front of}} Logan. Veronica discovers that Desmond’s bag was actually switched with another person’s. Veronica and Piz retrieve it, and on the car ride home, they briefly discuss their kiss at the party before playing a CD with some of Desmond’s unreleased newer material. Keith reconnects with Leo D’Amato (Max Greenfield), who presents a case involving the Fitzpatricks to him. They stake out where the Fitzpatricks are, and Keith sees Vinnie Van Lowe helping them. However, they quickly learn that Vinnie is actually investigating the case and has trapped them in the store. Veronica and Piz supposedly get stuck in traffic and tell Desmond to play some of his newer songs until they get there, but they actually are at the concert venue and just want him to expose the audience to his solo material.|$|E
5|$|Picton's probing {{attacks against}} the French center also met stiff resistance. Picton split the 3rd Division, sending Thomas Brisbane's brigade up the right spur toward Foy's {{position}} and Keane's brigade up the left spur toward Darmagnac's division. Keane was supported by Manley Power's Portuguese brigade from 3rd Division. Brisbane was followed up the right spur by Clinton's 6th Division. Since the valleys between the spurs were deep and muddy, both advances were restricted to narrow fronts. Picton's skirmishers quickly drove back the French outposts. When the leading brigades came under accurate artillery fire from the Escorial and Lafaurie knolls, Picton held back his formed troops and reinforced his skirmish line to seven British light companies, three 5th/60th Foot rifle companies and the entire 11th Caçadores Battalion. This heavy skirmish line moved forward until it {{came into contact with}} Soult's main defense line, but it was unable to press any farther. For two hours, Picton waited for Beresford's attack <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>progress</b> as the two sides skirmished.|$|E
5|$|The 1952 and 1953 seasons {{followed}} a similar pattern: Cleveland reached {{the championship game}} but lost both times to the Detroit Lions. In 1952's championship game, Detroit won 17–7 after a muffed punt by the Browns, several Lions defensive stands and a 67-yard touchdown run by Doak Walker scuttled Cleveland's chances. The team finished 11–1 in 1953, but lost the championship to the Lions 17–16 on a 33-yard Bobby Layne touchdown pass to Jim Doran with just over two minutes left. While the championship losses disappointed Cleveland fans who had grown accustomed to winning, the team continued <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>progress.</b> Len Ford, who the Browns picked up from the defunct AAFC's Los Angeles Dons team, emerged as a force on the defensive line, making the Pro Bowl each year between 1951 and 1953. Second-year wideout Ray Renfro became a star in 1953, also reaching the Pro Bowl.|$|E
