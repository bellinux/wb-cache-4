He looked like Rupert of Hentzau, and had all of that worthy's cold, sinister resolution about everything that he did." ...|$|E

In his opening words in his initial address, Khrushchev denigrated Stalin by asking delegates {{to rise in}} honor of the {{communist}} leaders who had died since the last congress, whom he named, equating Stalin with Klement Gottwald and the little-known Kyuichi Tokuda. In {{the early morning hours of}} 25 February, Khrushchev delivered what became known as the [...] "Secret Speech" [...] to a closed session of the Congress limited to Soviet delegates. In four hours, he demolished Stalin's reputation. Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that the [...] "congress listened to me in silence.

2500|$|From the {{perspective}} of modern science, the main obstacle {{to the evolution of}} speech-like communication in nature is not a mechanistic one. Rather, it is that symbols— arbitrary associations of sounds with corresponding meanings— are unreliable and may well be false. As <b>the</b> <b>saying</b> <b>goes,</b> [...] "words are cheap". The problem of reliability was not recognised at all by Darwin, Müller or the other early evolutionist theorists.|$|E
2500|$|... "Having labored now twenty years, {{the best}} ones of my life, in {{dispensing}} at retail, as <b>the</b> <b>saying</b> <b>goes,</b> at the demand of everyone, that little talent in my profession that God and my own efforts have given me, my desires would truly be to obtain enough leisure and quiet as would enable me before I die to complete three great works that I have in hand {{in order to be}} able to publish them, perhaps with some praise for me and for whoever has helped me in the business. ... It is not possible to receive a salary from a Republic, however splendid and generous, without serving the public, because to get something from the public one must satisfy it and not just one particular person; and while I remain able to teach and to serve, no one can exempt me from the burden while leaving me the income; and in sum I cannot hope for such a benefit from anyone but an absolute prince." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{propensity}} {{theory of}} probability was given by Charles Sanders Peirce. A later propensity theory was proposed by philosopher Karl Popper, who had only slight acquaintance with the writings of C.S. Peirce, however. Popper noted that {{the outcome of a}} physical experiment is produced by a certain set of [...] "generating conditions". [...] When we repeat an experiment, as <b>the</b> <b>saying</b> <b>goes,</b> we really perform another experiment with a (more or less) similar set of generating conditions. [...] To say that a set of generating conditions has propensity p of producing the outcome E means that those exact conditions, if repeated indefinitely, would produce an outcome sequence in which E occurred with limiting relative frequency p. [...] For Popper then, a deterministic experiment would have propensity 0 or 1 for each outcome, since those generating conditions would have same outcome on each trial. [...] In other words, non-trivial propensities (those that differ from 0 and 1) only exist for genuinely indeterministic experiments.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Ui Fidgenti circa 377 a.d., there were few significant changes in political control until the arrival of the Vikings in the 9th century, which ultimately brought about {{the establishment}} of the city on an island on the River Shannon in 922. The death of Domnall Mór Ua Briain, King of Munster in 1194 resulted in the invading Normans taking control of Limerick, and in 1210, the County of Limerick was formally established as Ui Fidgenti lands were granted to what would become the Fitzgerald dynasty. [...] Over time, the Normans became [...] "more Irish than the Irish themselves" [...] as <b>the</b> <b>saying</b> <b>goes.</b> The Tudors in England wanted to curb the power of these Gaelicised Norman Rulers and centralise all power in their hands, so they established colonies of English in the county. Distrust by England of the leading Fitzgerald families, and the execution of the several of the Fitzgeralds of Kildare, precipitated a revolt against English Rule in 1569. Th resultant savage war in Munster, known as the Desmond Rebellions, laid waste to the province, and ended with confiscation of the vast estates of the Geraldines and other Irish families that had participated in the ten years of war.|$|E
