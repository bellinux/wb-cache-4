5|$|The {{success of}} Who Framed Roger Rabbit rekindled an {{interest}} in the Golden Age of American animation, and sparked the modern animation scene. In 1991, Walt Disney Imagineering began to develop Mickey's Toontown for Disneyland, based on the Toontown that appeared in the film. The attraction also features a ride called Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin. Three theatrical animated shorts were also produced; <b>Tummy</b> Trouble played in front of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Roller Coaster Rabbit was shown with Dick Tracy and Trail Mix-Up was included with A Far Off Place. The film also inspired a short-lived comic book and video game spin-offs, including two PC games, the Japanese version of The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle (which features Roger instead of Bugs), a 1989 game released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and a 1991 game released on the Game Boy.|$|E

500|$|The Great Dining Room is {{situated}} in the east wing extension {{of the house and}} was added in 1877 under J. MacVicar Anderson {{during the time of the}} Red Earl. The room was inspired by the ballroom of Buckingham Palace, with walls hung with faded, red damask silk. The Spencers ate their regular meals in the Tapestry Dining Room, an inner room of the east side to the east of the Wooton Hall. Aside from the two fine vividly constructed tapestries, one of gypsies and one of farming, the room is fairly bleak in design compared to other rooms in the house; the dining table is relatively small, with a drab grey floor and open brick fireplace dated in large letters to 1683. The [...] "sombre" [...] oak panelling originally came from the family's other property of Wormleighton Manor in Warwickshire.

[...] Robert Christgau wrote in The Village Voice, [...] "In case you bought the con, disco never died — just reverted to the crazies who thought it was worth living for. This shamelessly ersatz blonde is one of them, and with the craftily orchestrated help of a fine selection of producers, remixers, and DJs, she's come up with a shamelessly ersatz sound that's tighter than her <b>tummy</b> — essence of electro, the D in DOR." [...] Don Shewey from Rolling Stone was of the opinion that [...] "without overstepping the modest ambitions of minimal funk, Madonna issues an irresistible invitation to the dance." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine rated the album four and a half out of five stars and commented: [...] "Heralding the synth-heavy movement was a debut album [...] that sounds just as fresh today as it did almost two decades ago." [...] In March 2012, the publication placed the album at number 33 on their [...] "Best Albums of the 1980s" [...] list.

40|$|Food {{insecurity}} is {{a growing}} public health concern in Oregon. Those that are food insecure often develop strategies, such as reducing the size of meals, cutting out fruits, vegetables and meats or skipping meals entirely, to make food last. One group that is disproportionately affected by food insecurity is families. Full <b>Tummies,</b> Full lives (FTFL) was designed to improve nutrition among children in families in Benton County, Oregon experiencing food insecurity by providing education, skill building and community support. To evaluate FTFL, seven one-on-one {{interviews were conducted with}} professionals working in the areas of food security and/or nutrition education. The goal of these interviews was to gain their opinions on the feasibility of nutrition education and cooking skills programs, learn more about the needs of low-income and food insecure families and the barriers these families experience to participating in health promotion programs. The information gathered from these interviews was then used to evaluate FTFL to determine if FTFL is relevant for food insecure families, addresses areas that other available programs do not; focuses on the correct needs of this population; and if the components of FTFL are feasible. Proposed changes to the program, as well as directions for future research are also discussed...|$|R

50|$|At Galta Temple, Tarak, {{the alpha}} male of the 60-strong troop of rhesus macaques {{known as the}} Galta Gang, is finding that life at the top can be tough. He has become a father again but his queen Rani, baby Esha {{and the rest of}} the troop are hungry. The drought is taking its toll with less worshippers handing out food to the monkeys at the temple. With his troop {{becoming}} more restless, Tarak has a crisis on his hands, and it's not just the rumbling <b>tummies</b> of his troop members, there is a rebel in his ranks. Zamir, nine-year-old subordinate male, is one of the highest ranking males in the troop and has his eye on the top job. Another threat closer to home are the troop's envious neighbours, the langur monkeys. These agile monkeys thrive on the forest leaves which macaques find inedible, therefore they are after the temple's fresh supply of water at the spring pool. Meanwhile, Tarak leads the troop into the city in search of feeding opportunities and while most of the troop have their eyes on the busy streets, the teenage duo Bipin, Yash and Tito have their eyes on the birds, and at this time of year where there are birds there are eggs. The trio follow a pair of birds, closely followed by Zamir who simply lets the youngsters do all the hard work and take all the risks only to come and take whatever they manage to achieve for himself. Eventually the teens don't manage to get anything out of harassing the birds and move on. Zamir spots a cart seller pushing his cart full of food items and while the cart seller gets out of sight, Zamir moves in to help himself to the food, closely followed by the teens and then eventually Tarak {{and the rest of the}} Galta Gang hear the alarm call notifying that food has been found. The troop waste no time feeding on the food items on the cart before the cart seller spots his stock being eaten by a bunch of thieving monkeys. Most of the troop manage to flee from sight but Zamir gets cornered and finally lashes out and scratches the cart seller. The injured cart seller calls the city's monkey catcher who is soon hot on the gang's trail. The Monkey Catcher sets up a trap near the temple and fills it with food items to tempt law-breaking monkeys to take the bait. At animal charity 'Help In Suffering' one member of the Galta Gang has only recently found his feet. Kavi has been under the care of animal carer Saresh Valmiki since being found lying in the city after suffering an electric shock. He is given fresh food and accommodation daily, unlike the Galta Gang who have to deal with food shortages. Kavi makes substantial progress but still has a long recovery to go. Meanwhile, back at the temple, the Galta Gang have more pressing concerns, the langurs take the chance and invade the temple, but alpha male Tarak leads the Galta Gang into the defence of their precious temple and send the langurs to flee, though in the chase the troop once again find themselves in the city streets. On their way back, the troop come across the Monkey Catcher's trap and while most of the more experienced individuals keep at a safe distance despite the food inside the trap, curiosity gets the better of the teens and Yash, Tito and several of the gang get captured. Bipin managed to escape the capture, but his two best pals weren't so lucky. The captives get shifted into small cages and are driven away for relocation. The Monkey Catcher's real target, Zamir, manages to escape and it is because of his act of scratching the cart seller that an innocent band of troop members were captured and taken to a forest, miles away from the city of Jaipur.|$|R
