It was directed by Soichi Masui, written by Yuniko Ayana, and had music written by Yasuhisa Inoue and Susumi Akizuki. The series originated due to producer Akio Ofuji, who was also the marketing producer for the Final Fantasy series. Ofuji's favorite character from the game was Prompto, and the anime grew from the wish to expand upon a reference in the game to the character's difficult childhood. The concept was first proposed in 2014, {{a year and a}} half before its reveal. Its format as an anime series was based both on staff suggestions and the fact that Kingsglaive was already in production as a CGI feature. Episodes were produced fairly quickly, being created and released at monthly intervals. As they were released, the creators took fan feedback into account when creating future episodes. The nature of Brotherhood as a free anime caused problems when it came to funding the project: this had been decided upon to get the anime to the widest audience possible. Ultimately, the budget was split between the <b>total</b> <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> of Final Fantasy XV and projected physical sales after the anime's release.|$|E

30|$|Maintenance {{has become}} one of the most {{important}} issues in the manufacturing industry due to high costs involved (Savsar 2011). In production systems, maintenance managers concentrate on reducing maintenance costs (Cavalcante and De Almedia 2008). In manufacturing organizations, maintenance-related costs are estimated to be 25 % of the overall operating cost (Cross 1988). According to Maggard and Rhyne (1992), the maintenance can represent between 10 % and 40 % of the <b>production</b> <b>cost</b> in a company. Coetzee (2004) means that the numbers should be 15 % to 50 %. Bevilacqua and Braglia (2000) state that maintenance costs can represent as much as 15 % to 70 % of the <b>total</b> <b>production</b> <b>cost.</b> So, it seems plausible that the maintenance costs may very well represent over 15 % of the <b>total</b> <b>production</b> <b>cost</b> in industry (Salonen and Deleryd 2011).

50|$|Growth of Arthrospira platensis {{depends on}} several factors. To achieve maximum output, {{factors such as}} the temperature, light and photoinhibition, nutrients, and CO2 level, need to be adjusted. In summer the main {{limiting}} factor of spirulina growth is light. When growing in water depths of 12-15 cm self-shading governs the growth of the individual cell. However, research has shown, that growth is also photoinhibited, and can be increased trough shading. The level of photoinhibiton versus the lack of light is always a question of cell concentration in the medium. The optimal growth temperature for A. platensis is 35 - 38 °C. This poses a major limiting factor outside the tropics, confining growth to the summer months. A. platensis has been grown in fresh water, as well as in brackish water and sea water. Apart from mineral fertilizer various sources such as, waste effluents, and effluents from fertilizer, starch and noodle factories have been used as nutrient source.Especially the waste effluents are also available in rural locations, allowing small scale production.One of the major hurdles for larger scale production is the complicated harvesting process that makes up for 20-30% of the <b>total</b> <b>production</b> <b>costs.</b> Due to small size, and diluted cultures (mass concentration less than 1 g/L-1) with densities close to that of water microalgae are difficult to separate from their medium.|$|E
