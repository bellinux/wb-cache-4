Planned BSC work will be evaluated to determine if the work is covered by a previously defined activity, product or service (see Table 2); if work activities require redefinition or addition of a new activity; and if the significant evaluation for each environment aspect is still valid based on scope of planned work. New workscope initiated during the fiscal year through the Baseline Change Proposal process (i. e., not as part of the annual work plan) also will be reviewed for new environmental aspects and determination of whether the new workscope would change the significance rating of any environmental aspect.

40|$|Appearance-based {{approaches}} in face recognition, specifically the Eigenface approach, {{were one of}} first successful demonstrations of machine recognition of faces [1]. These methods, such as those proposed in [2, 3], proved {{to be effective in}} experiments with large databases. Further development of holistic methods of face recognition and their theoretical background, such as those proposed in [4 - 9], were focused towards recognizing faces from images with changes caused by illumination effects and pose variations. Although much effort has been made towards this goal, current algorithms are still far away from the capability of the human perception system [1]. <b>This</b> <b>report</b> <b>shall</b> give {{a detailed description of the}} fundamentals of appearance-based holistic methods for face recognition, specifically the Eigenface approach [3], as well as our experimental results on the Yale Face Database...|$|R
40|$|Earlier face {{recognition}} algorithms have performed sufficiently well under tight environment constraints. However, simplistic and crude algorithms {{such as the}} geometric feature-based matching method and the template matching method fail catastrophically under slight environment changes, such as illumination variations. More sophisticated approaches like the Eigenface method or other Appearance-Based Methods, which had worked extremely well for face images with considerable changes in facial expression and occlusions, failed to tackle the issue of lighting changes. More recently, developments of methods that involve creating generative models of face images and extracting three-dimensional shape of faces have shown promising results. <b>This</b> <b>report</b> <b>shall</b> attempt to provide {{a detailed account of}} the Illumination Cones method that has shown a vast accuracy improvement compared to earlier methods in terms of robustness against illumination variationTat-Jun Chin and D.
