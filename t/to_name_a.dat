50|$|The {{concept of}} a {{testamentary}} document similar to but distinct from a will had its origins in Roman law.

Failure <b>to</b> <b>name</b> <b>an</b> heir or failure to follow the proper formalities for <b>naming</b> <b>an</b> heir would result in an estate divided {{by the rules of}} intestacy. However, a testator was also able to create a fideicommissum, a more flexible and less formal indication of the testator's intent which could have the effect of transferring part or all of an estate after death, although with fewer rights to the beneficiary than those of <b>a</b> <b>named</b> heir.|$|R

5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the new millennium, {{president}} Joan Laporta, a supporter of Catalan nationalism, repeatedly expressed his support of Catalonia's secession from Spain and characterised the club as the symbol for Catalan separatism.

By 2003 Barcelona had 1,200 penyes around the world, causing other Spanish clubs to copy the concept.
