In the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza, Israel withdrew all settlers and military presence from <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> Strip, but maintained military control of numerous {{aspects of the}} territory including its borders, air space and coast. Israel's ongoing military occupation of <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem {{continues to be the}} world's longest military occupation in modern times.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of Gaza depends on groundwater {{as the only}} source for drinking, agricultural use, and domestic supply. The nearest stream is Wadi Ghazza to the south, sourced from Abu Middein along the coastline. It bears {{a small amount of}} water during the winter and virtually no water during the summer. Most of its water supply is diverted into Israel. <b>The</b> <b>Gaza</b> Aquifer along the coast is the main aquifer in <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> Strip and it consists mostly of Pleistocene sandstones. Like most of <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> Strip, Gaza is covered by quaternary soil; clay minerals in the soil absorb many organic and inorganic chemicals which has partially alleviated the extent of groundwater contamination.|$|E

5|$|Gauze is {{reputed to}} have {{originated}} in Gaza. Cloth for <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> thob was often woven at nearby Majdal (Ascalon). Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric {{that had been}} made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. Thobs here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (muqass), combs (mushut) and triangles (hijab) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use of odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye.|$|E

See Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004. Since the Israeli withdrawal, Hamas has been engaged in a sometimes violent power struggle with its rival Palestinian organization Fatah. On January 25, 2006, Hamas won a surprise victory in the elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority. In 2007, Hamas overthrew Fatah forces in <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> Strip and Hamas members were dismissed from the PNA government in the West Bank in response.

In 2008, Israel commenced an assault against Gaza. Israel stated the strikes were in response to repetitive rocket and mortar attacks from <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> Strip into Israel since 2005, while the Palestinians stated that they were responding to Israel's military incursions and blockade of <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> Strip.
