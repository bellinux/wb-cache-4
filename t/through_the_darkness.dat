An owl symbolizes her ability to navigate the darkness and her wisdom. The owl is also said to act as a messenger. A lamp symbolizes intelligence and spirit, to light the way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> of ignorance and doubt.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the song}} is ostensibly about love and dependency, like many U2 songs, it also lends itself to {{religious}} interpretations. Listeners have heard an allusion to the Book of Job [...] and its tale of God serving as a lamp upon Job's head walking <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness.</b> [...] Robyn Brothers suggests that ultraviolet light is [...] "a metaphor for a divine force both unseen {{to the naked eye}} and ultimately unknowable to the human intellect." [...] Conversely, Steve Stockman, author of Walk On: The Spiritual Journey Of U2, sees [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] as being about Bono's wife Ali Hewson, and [...] "how when he feels like trash, she makes him clean," [...] but says {{there is good reason to}} interpret the song as being just as much about God. The song's title supports this view: indigo and violet rarely appear in song lyrics as frequently as other colours, while ultraviolet represents an unseen wavelength beyond the visible spectrum.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Ancient Greeks, {{there were}} caverns {{under the surface}} which were entrances leading to the underworld, {{some of which were}} the caverns at Tainaron in Lakonia, at Trozien in Argolis, at Ephya in Thesprotia, at Herakleia in Pontos, and in Ermioni. In Thracian and Dacian legends, it is said that there are {{underground}} chambers occupied by an ancient God called Zalmoxis.

2500|$|According to Gough, {{they had}} a {{specific}} intention for {{the ending of the}} second season: [...] "Season one ended with the height of heroism, with Clark running into a tornado to save Lana. For season two, we wanted to see the nadir of that, which is Clark running away [...] from his problems." [...] Gough likens the finale to the ending of The Empire Strikes Back, in that Clark leaves Smallville and everyone he loves because he is scared. According to Gough, in order to do [...] "the character justice", you have to take his journey <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness,</b> with him failing along the way.|$|E

2500|$|On May 11, 1984, eight teenage {{visitors}} {{were trapped in}} the Haunted Castle attraction, and died when it was destroyed by fire. [...] Six Flags Great Adventure and its parent company Six Flags were subsequently indicted for aggravated manslaughter, accused of recklessly causing the deaths by taking inadequate precautions against a fire. [...] In the subsequent trial, the prosecution argued that repeated warnings by safety consultants to install sprinklers or smoke alarms had been ignored. [...] The defendants denied any culpability, and contended that the fire was arson and that no precautions would have saved lives. [...] The trial jury found the defendants not guilty. A light bulb had burned out {{in one of the}} rooms of the attraction, and a 14-year-old boy lit a cigarette lighter to find his way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness.</b> The flame ignited some foam rubber padding which was used to protect people from bumping into a wall. A fire resulted, which quickly spread throughout the 17-trailer structure with the help of extremely flammable building materials. The fire eventually engulfed and totally destroyed the attraction.|$|E
