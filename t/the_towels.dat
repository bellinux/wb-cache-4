25|$|During his imprisonment, Albizu {{suffered}} deteriorating health. He {{alleged that}} he was the subject of human radiation experiments in prison and said that he could see colored rays bombarding him. When he wrapped wet towels around his head in order to shield himself from the radiation, the prison guards ridiculed him as El Rey de las Toallas (The King of <b>the</b> <b>Towels).</b>|$|E
25|$|Running {{water was}} {{supplied}} in lead pipes, {{and where there}} were taps they were bronze, although in most cases in England metal fittings have been removed since {{the dissolution of the}} monasteries. The monks' towels were kept nearby in cupboards called aumbries (derived from the Latin armarium or from Medieval Latin almarium). The Refectorian was responsible for keeping the lavatorium clean and ensuring it contained sand and a whetstone for the monks to sharpen their knives, and for changing <b>the</b> <b>towels</b> twice a week.|$|E
500|$|The 12th Man Towel {{was created}} in the fall of 1985 by Rusty Riley and Kyle Harris, then {{president}} {{and vice president of the}} 12th Man Student Aggie Club, respectively, with the help of Gary Leach and Larry Leach, then club secretary and treasurer. The concept was presented to the Aggie Club faculty managers Harry Green Jr., executive director of the 12th Man Foundation, and Jackie Sherrill, Texas A University athletic director and head football coach. Once their approval was given, Rusty and Kyle found a manufacturer in New York City through a local distributor in Bryan, Texas, and authorization was given to sell <b>the</b> <b>towels</b> on campus by school management and Chic Sell, who had the concession rights in Kyle Field. [...] The first 1,000 towels were purchased and delivered in time for the first home game of the 1985 college football season. Kyle and Rusty, along with a handful of Aggie Club members, sold <b>the</b> <b>towels</b> for $2 each in makeshift booths at strategic locations within Kyle Field. It was an immediate success, with all towels being sold at the first game. [...] The A Yell Leaders initially resisted <b>the</b> <b>towels,</b> claiming the Aggie Club was breaking tradition, but the Battalion staff supported the concept and began a successful selling and media campaign to help the towel gain acceptance throughout the A student body. Rusty worked with the Head Yell Leader on accepting the towel and once the Yell Leaders accepted it, a press conference was held with Rusty, Coach Sherrill, and the Head Yell Leader. [...] As the football season carried on, the 12th Man Towel continued selling in large quantities. The Aggie Club hired students to sell <b>the</b> <b>towels</b> at the MSC and on Aggie Club property, which at the time was located right outside of the main entrance to Kyle Field. The towel also gained an important supporting cast when Coach Sherrill's 12th man kick-off team squad began carrying them to motivate the student body in the stands. The 1985 regular college football season ended with a home game versus the Texas Longhorns. At that game, a sea of white 12th Man Towels filled the stadium, cheering the Aggies to a 42-10 victory. The Aggies went on to win the Southwest Conference Title and defeat Auburn in the Cotton Bowl on January 1, 1986, with the 12th Man Towels proudly displayed to a national audience. Tony Pollacia (15), a member of the 12th man squad, and his towel-waving antics became legendary. When Texas A won its first Cotton Bowl under Coach Jackie Sherrill in 1986, the Dallas Morning News chose to run his photograph, in color, on the front page of its Sunday paper. During the 1988 Cotton Bowl Classic, which A played against Notre Dame, another towel was a point of contention. [...] Twice during that game, Warren Barhorst, a member of Sherrill's 12th Man Kickoff Team, tackled Heisman Trophy winner Tim Brown, and then grabbed Brown's towel and waved it over his head. [...] An infuriated Brown tackled Barhorst, earning himself a 15-yard unsportsman-like conduct penalty.|$|E
500|$|Upon its invention, Cope {{commented on}} the multi-functional ability of <b>The</b> Terrible <b>Towel,</b> [...] "I'll tell 'em they can use <b>the</b> <b>towel</b> to wipe their seats clean. They can {{use it as a}} muffler against the cold. They can drape it over their heads if it rains." [...] However, <b>the</b> <b>towel</b> is often used by fans who do not attend games. Fans often drape <b>the</b> <b>towel</b> over their radios or {{television}} sets; some even dress their pets or babies with it.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> red <b>towel</b> {{is famous}} at WKU. The origins of <b>the</b> <b>towel</b> come from Hilltopper {{basketball}} head coach Edgar Diddle after getting upset that <b>the</b> team's <b>towels</b> were being stolen. He decided {{that all of}} <b>the</b> teams <b>towels</b> were to be red. After <b>the</b> red <b>towels</b> were made, Diddle threw them to the rafters, beat them on the floor, chewed on them, waved, twisted, and even cried into them.|$|R

In this study {{it has been used}} to aid the clinical and electromyographic assessment of 21 infants with obstetric brachial plexus palsy. At 2 to 3 months, none of the 21 infants succeeded in removing <b>the</b> <b>towel,</b> either with their normal or affected arm. At 6 months, all the infants succeeded in removing <b>the</b> <b>towel</b> with their normal arm, but 11 could not with their affected arm, and the same was observed at a further assessment at 9 months. <b>The</b> <b>towel</b> test is a reliable technique for evaluating children with obstetric brachial plexus injuries...|$|R
500|$|The Terrible Towel is {{traditionally}} {{known as the}} first [...] "rally towel"; its popularity has spawned similar traditions for other teams. Fans of the Minnesota Twins cheer {{the team with the}} [...] "Homer Hanky" [...] during the playoffs. The Philadelphia Phillies have distributed white towels to fans during home games. During a 2006 playoff game against the Steelers, the Indianapolis Colts handed out blue towels to rally fans, however, Pittsburgh {{went on to win the}} game. In a 2000 preseason game, played in Mexico City, many fans that filled the 100,000 seat Aztec Stadium waved towels. Cope, glad that the Allegheny Valley School would receive a sizable donation from the proceeds, was later disappointed to learn <b>the</b> <b>towels</b> waved by the fans were [...] "knockoffs" [...] made by local artists, and therefore no proceeds would go to the school. In 2008, the NFL approved a white towel entitled the Trophy Towel, which will be sold to fans and given to the winning team of Super Bowl XLIII. Members of the Steelers criticized the idea, broadcaster Bill Hillgrove—who worked with Cope—called the idea [...] "a cheap imitation." [...] Steelers player Aaron Smith stated, [...] "It started here, so why would anyone else want to have a towel? Why not kazoos?" [...] During the 2010 Memorial Cup the host committee made up 8,000 yellow towels to represent the host team, the Brandon Wheat Kings, who played the Moncton Wildcats. Many fans brought <b>the</b> <b>towels</b> back for games after that. [...] Waving white rally towels has the unfortunate distinction of resembling surrender by waving a white flag (citation needed).|$|E
500|$|The three men, {{along with}} other radio station {{advertising}} personnel, began brainstorming ideas. One idea, a black mask including coach Chuck Noll's motto [...] "Whatever it takes", was deemed too expensive. Cope said the gimmick should be something [...] "lightweight and portable and already owned by just about every fan." [...] Garrett suggested using towels. Cope agreed, suggesting the words [...] "The Terrible Towel" [...] be printed on the front. It was agreed that <b>the</b> <b>towels</b> would be gold or yellow, with the writing in blackthe colors of the Steelers. Franklin C. Snyder, who was head of WTAE's radio and television stations, held the final approval of the idea. He approved the idea on the stipulation that black towels would also be allowed, {{in order to avoid}} accusations of racism from the FCC; Cope and Garrett agreed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main part}} of the suite, [...] "Dental Hygiene Dilemma" [...] {{incorporates}} elements of rock band, orchestra and spoken dialogue, and depicts Jeff smoking a marijuana cigarette which had been dipped in Don Preston's [...] "foamy liquids" [...] and imagining Donovan appearing to him on a wall-mounted television as his [...] "good conscience" [...] and asking him not to steal <b>the</b> <b>towels,</b> while Studebacher Hoch appears to him as his evil conscience, [...] "dressed as Jim Pons", and convinces Jeff to quit the Mothers of Invention, start his own hard rock band and play music like Grand Funk Railroad or Black Sabbath. In real life, Simmons started his own blues rock band after leaving Zappa's band, and released the album Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up for Straight Records, which Zappa produced. In [...] "Dilemma", Volman exclaims [...] "We got to get him back to normal before Zappa finds out and steals it and makes him do it in the movie!" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the game, Cope advertised the idea of <b>the</b> <b>towel</b> to fans on the radio and evening {{television}} news, using the phrase [...] "The Terrible Towel is poised to strike!" [...] However, Atkins grew nervous that fans would think <b>the</b> <b>towel</b> was a jinx if the Steelers lost the game. Cope agreed to poll players on their view of <b>the</b> <b>towel.</b> Linebacker Jack Ham told Cope, [...] "I think your idea stinks"; Ernie [...] "Fats" [...] Holmes was also against the idea. Also against the idea of <b>the</b> <b>Towel</b> was Andy Russell, who mirrored Cope's original thoughts, [...] "We're not a gimmick team. We've never been a gimmick team."

Prior to the game, Cope, whose idea had been mocked by the local Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, watched the gathering fans through his binoculars from the broadcast booth. He saw less than a dozen towels while players were going through pre-game warm-ups. Cope recalls, [...] "Nearing kickoff, the Steelers gathered in their tunnel for introductions, whereupon the crowd exploded - and suddenly, by my estimation, 30,000 Terrible <b>Towels</b> twirled from <b>the</b> fists of fans around the stadium!" [...] The Steelers went on to defeat the Colts 28 - 10. In the following weeks, the team defeated the Oakland Raiders and Dallas Cowboys, to capture the franchise's second consecutive Super Bowl victory. Even while the Steelers struggled through <b>the</b> 1980s, <b>the</b> <b>Towel</b> remained a large part of the franchise. During <b>the</b> <b>Towel's</b> debut game Andy Russell, who had opposed the idea of <b>the</b> <b>Towel,</b> returned a fumble 93‒yards for a touchdown.

5000|$|One type of {{evaporative}} humidifier {{makes use}} of just a reservoir and wick. Sometimes called a [...] "natural humidifier", these are usually non-commercial devices that can be assembled at little or no cost. One version of a natural humidifier uses a stainless steel bowl, partially filled with water, covered by a towel. A waterproof weight is used to sink <b>the</b> <b>towel</b> in <b>the</b> center of the bowl. There {{is no need for}} a fan, because the water spreads through <b>the</b> <b>towel</b> by capillary action and <b>the</b> <b>towel</b> surface area is large enough to provide for rapid evaporation. The stainless steel bowl is much easier to clean than typical humidifier water tanks.
