5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets have a tendency for their aphelia to coincide with a giant planet's semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the largest group. It is clear that comets {{coming in from the}} Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets {{as a result of a}} close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> massive as all the other planets combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.|$|E

A series of benchmark tests conducted on the graphics performance of the fourth-generation iPad by Anandtech resulted in the device achieving the highest score compared to other consumer mobile devices, including the Samsung Galaxy S III, Nexus 10 and third-generation iPad. The performance increase of the fourth-generation iPad varies between tests, however an increase is nonetheless evident. Furthermore, battery longevity tests {{conducted by}} the same organization suggests that the battery of the fourth-generation iPad is able to last longer than its predecessor. However, the battery of the updated iPad 2 is able to outlast the fourth-generation iPad.|$|E

5|$|County went undefeated in Gannon's {{first four}} league games in charge. After three weeks, this upturn in results saw Gannon offered the job full-time, which {{allowed him to}} guide County to safety. The club won more <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> many {{points in the second}} half of the season than they did in the first. Believing that safety would be assured on the final day of the season, he was proved correct as they managed to avoid relegation with a final day draw with champions Carlisle United.

After delaying talks, he accepted a one-year rolling contract in the summer.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging is less effective than CT at directly imaging sites of CSF leak. MRI studies may show pachymeningeal enhancement (when the dura mater looks thick and inflamed), sagging of the brain, pituitary enlargement, subdural hygromas, engorgement of cerebral venous sinuses, and other abnormalities. For 20% of patients, MRIs present as completely normal. There is disagreement over whether MRI {{should be the}} study of choice. MRIs performed with the patient seated upright (vs. laying supine) are not better for diagnosing CSF leaks, but are more <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> effective at diagnosing cerebellar tonsillar ectopia, also known as Chiari malformation. Cerebellar tonsillar ectopia shares {{many of the same}} symptoms as CSF leak, but originates either congenitally or from trauma, including whiplash strain to the dura.|$|E
5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} was {{formerly}} often treated as the small, pale northern subspecies {{of the rock}} martin, but it is now usually {{considered to be a}} separate species. The changes in size and colour are continuous, so the evidence for separate species is not strong, although some rock martins can weigh more <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> much as the smallest subspecies of the pale crag martin. The average weight for P.o.fusciventris is 22.4g (0.79oz) against 10g (0.35oz) for P.o.obsoleta.

The Chicago Park District runs the station, which has a full-time staff.|$|E
5|$|An off spinner, Johnson was {{a member}} of Bradman’s first-choice team, playing in four of the five Tests before being dropped for the final rubber. He also played in the matches against Worcestershire, the MCC and Leveson-Gower's XI, where Australia {{selected}} their strongest possible team. However, Johnson was not prominent in the Test success, taking seven wickets at 61.00, his best result being 3/72 in the first innings of the Second Test. Among the five frontline bowlers used in four or more Tests, Lindwall, Miller, Toshack, Johnston and Johnson, the last had the worst average by a factor of almost two; Toshack averaged 33.09 and the others less than 23.50. Lindwall and Johnston took 27 wickets each, while Miller and Toshack took 13 and 11 respectively. Johnson’s economy rate was the second worst of the quintet and his strike rate of 156.86 was more <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> bad as the others, with the exception of Toshack (94.46). Johnson also had little impact with the bat, scoring 51 runs at 10.20, but he did take five catches in the slips.|$|E
5|$|Kentrosaurus can be {{distinguished}} from {{other members of the}} Stegosauria by a number of osteological characters. Mallison (2011) provided a revised diagnosis, an updated list of distinguishing traits or autapomorphies. Most notably, the neural spines, the blade-like upper extensions of the vertebrae, in the tail do not run sub-parallel, as in most dinosaurs. In the front third of the tail, they point backwards, the usual direction. In the middle tail, however, they are almost vertical, and further back they are hook-shaped and point obliquely forward. Also typical is that the dorsal (back) vertebrae have a neural arch more <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> high as the centrum, the vertebral body, and almost completely occupied by the extremely spacious neural canal. The preacetabular process, front blade, of the ilium widens laterally, to the front outer side, and does not taper.|$|E

5|$|Other ceratopsians {{from the}} Two Medicine Formation include Einiosaurus and Rubeosaurus. In addition, remains of other {{indeterminate}} and dubious centrosaurines, including Brachyceratops, are {{known from the}} formation and though they may represent younger stages of the three valid genera, this {{is not possible to}} demonstrate. Whereas Horner assumed that Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus were separate in time, in 2010 Donald M. Henderson considered it possible that at least their descendants or ancestors were overlapping or sympatric and thus would have competed for food sources unless there had been niche partitioning. The skull of Achelousaurus was more <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> strong than that of Einiosaurus in its bending strength and torsion resistance. This might have indicated a difference in diet to avoid competition. The bite strength of Achelousaurus, measured as an ultimate tensile strength, was 30.5newtonsper squaremeter (N/m²) at the maxillary tooth row and 18N/m² at the beak.|$|E
5|$|The bunkerisation {{programme}} was {{a massive}} drain on Albania's weak economy. The construction of prefabricated bunkers alone cost an estimated two percent of net material product, and in total the bunkers cost more <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> much as the Maginot Line in France, consuming {{three times as much}} concrete. The programme diverted resources away from other forms of development, such as roads and residential buildings. On average, they are said to have each cost the equivalent of a two-room apartment and the resources used to build them could easily have resolved Albania's chronic shortage of housing. According to Josif Zagali, building twenty smaller bunkers cost as much as constructing a kilometre of road. It also had a human cost; 70–100 people a year died constructing the bunkers. In addition, the bunkers occupied and obstructed a significant area of arable land.|$|E
5|$|Trescothick's 12 ODI {{hundreds}} are {{the most}} by an English cricketer, followed by Graham Gooch with eight, and current player Kevin Pietersen with seven. Trescothick passed Gooch's tally when he scored 100 not out against Bangladesh in his 100th ODI in 2005. This was also the fastest of his career, off 76 balls, the third fastest ODI century for an English batsman. Trescothick made his first ODI century against Pakistan, scoring a career-best 137. His century the following year against India in {{the final of the}} 2002 NatWest Series, along with two fifties earlier in the competition, saw him named Man of the Series. He was again named Man of the Series in the 2003 NatWest Challenge, finishing the three-match series with a century, a fifty and more <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> many runs as any other player. Only six days later, captaining his side against South Africa, Trescothick scored another century and, alongside fellow opener Vikram Solanki, set an English record first wicket partnership of 200.

5|$|Similar to its predecessor, Watch Dogs 2 is an action-adventure {{game with}} stealth {{elements}} and played from a third-person perspective as protagonist Marcus Holloway, a young hacker, the game features an open world environment {{set in a}} fictionalized version of the San Francisco Bay Area, an area more <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> large as the Chicago setting from Watch Dogs. The Bay Area consists of four different areas: San Francisco, Oakland, Marin, and Silicon Valley, {{all of which have}} different characteristics and aesthetics. Players can navigate the game's world on-foot or by the various vehicles featured in the game, such as cars, trucks, buses, cable cars, motorcycles, quad bikes and boats. The driving mechanic was overhauled and designed to be more accessible. The players can shoot their weapons while driving. Marcus also has improved acrobatic skills, and the ability to parkour around the city. Players can use different methods to approach the game's missions, choosing between the aggressive approach, in which they defeat enemies with guns which are made with a 3D printer; explosives, like mines; or Marcus' own melee weapon, a billiard ball attached to a bungee cord. Alternatively, players can use the stealth approach, in which they can evade enemies or paralyze them temporarily with Marcus' taser. Players can also complete the game through hacking alone. When players commit too many crimes, the police officers will become alerted and will attempt to arrest the player. The game upgrades system is a returning feature, with items being divided into three categories: Ghost, Aggressor, and Trickster. Players can choose their upgrades in accordance with their own playstyle.|$|E
