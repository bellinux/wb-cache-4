500|$|... "Not on Drugs" [...] {{was written}} by Lo {{alongside}} Alx Reuterskiöld, Jakob Jerlström and Ludvig Söderberg, with the latter two being credited as The Struts. It was included on the artist's debut extended play, Truth Serum and debut studio album, Queen of the Clouds, {{both of which were}} released in 2014. Reuterskiöld also co-wrote [...] "Out of Mind" [...] from Truth Serum and [...] "Got Love" [...] from Queen of the Clouds. Regarding her work with him, the singer confessed, [...] "He's a Swedish guy and is the most artistic person I've ever met. He's very hard to work with, but he's amazing, so it's worth it. Even though he <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> get his tone down". The track was recorded at Warner/Chappell Studios in Stockholm, with The Struts producing and programming it alongside playing the keys and guitars. Lars Norgren mixed the song, while Björn Engelmann mastered it at Cutting Room, Stockholm. Reuterskiöld also co-produced it and played the keys.|$|E
500|$|While reviewers were troubled with categorizing the band, {{much time}} was spent deliberating upon the album's sound when held in {{comparison}} with other Isis material. Robin Jahdi, writing for FACT Magazine, holds that the album presents a shift in dynamic. [...] "It <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> realise, but [...] is pretty different to what's come before from Aaron Turner and co. The last time this happened was 2002, when they transformed from brutal sludge metal to something altogether more delicate." [...] Here, he references the transition brokered when Isis released Oceanic, a critically acclaimed departure {{from the sound of}} 2000's Celestial. Other differences from some of Isis' previous material have been noted; on a broad scale, the album was deemed [...] "less punishing than Panopticon, from 2004, and less ponderous than In the Absence of Truth, from 2006", but closer examination also led Slants Matthew Cole to suggest differences. [...] "On past releases, Isis employed loud/soft dynamics to stunning effect, and while that element remains central to their sound, the best parts of Wavering Radiant suggest a more sophisticated integration. Rather than playing on the line between pretty and heavy, tracks like 'Stone to Wake a Serpent' and '20 Minutes / 40 Years' dissolve it." [...] Not all reviews held the album to be such a departure – for instance, Andrew Hartwig feels that [...] "Wavering Radiant continues in the direction that Isis have been travelling since their inception, with an increasing prominence of melody and a greater focus on placid sections to balance out their signature crushing heaviness".|$|E
2500|$|The {{television}} series is inconsistent {{on the question}} of whether Time Lords can recognise each other across regenerations. For example, in The Deadly Assassin an old classmate of the Doctor's, Runcible, is slow to recognise the Doctor in his fourth incarnation, and once he has, it then takes him a while to realise that his appearance has changed. However, in The Armageddon Factor (1978), Drax, another old classmate, recognises the Fourth Doctor immediately although they had not seen each other since the Academy (the Doctor <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> remember Drax, though).|$|E

2500|$|Queen versus rook (see Philidor position#Queen versus rook). [...] There are two changes here {{enabling}} the rook {{to put up}} a better defense, but the queen still wins. [...] (a) People usually opt for a second-rank defense with the rook on the second rank and the king behind it (or symmetrical positions on the other edges of the board). [...] Tablebases show that a third-rank defense <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> breach, which is difficult for a human to do. [...] (b) People had assumed that the rook needs to stay as close to the king for as long as possible, but tablebases show that it is best to move the rook away from the king at some earlier point [...]|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, the Kinect {{garnered}} positive opinions from reviewers and critics. IGN {{gave the}} device 7.5 out of 10, saying that [...] "Kinect {{can be a}} tremendous amount of fun for casual players, and the creative, controller-free concept is undeniably appealing", though adding that for [...] "$149.99, a motion-tracking camera add-on for Xbox 360 is a tough sell, especially considering that the entry level variation of Xbox 360 itself is only $199.99". Game Informer rated Kinect 8 out of 10, praising the technology but noting that the experience <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> get used to and that the spatial requirement may pose a barrier. Computer and Video Games called the device a technological gem and applauded the gesture and voice controls, while criticizing the launch lineup and Kinect Hub.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Jackson {{claimed that}} the poor {{reception}} [...] "wasn't particularly surprising" [...] because [...] "it does take you {{a while to get}} used to it. Ten minutes is sort of marginal, it probably needed a little bit more". However, once the entire film was released, many critics retained their complaints. While many noted the clarity and immediacy of the action scenes, they also criticised the picture quality as [...] "hyper-real," [...] clear enough to detect [...] "painted sets" [...] and [...] "prosthetic noses". Some critics did respond positively to the overall effect of the higher frame rate, saying it just <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> get used to– still allowing that the extra clarity can make some scenes look like [...] "actors on a set rather than a scene in a movie".|$|E
50|$|Rugby <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> {{find its}} feet in all towns {{after the war}} and the same was true for Goulburn. There were several starts in the 1920s and '30s and by 1939 we had grown back into a Goulburn-based competition. The best players from that side played a Canberra rep side and beat them by 30-10 but then war came to knock us over again. Again, it <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> get started after the war with a few more false starts but things were up and running again in the fifties.|$|R

2500|$|Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter {{was more}} {{critical}} of the documentary, calling it [...] "lightweight but warm-hearted" [...] and a [...] "genial love letter to a minor musical cult", but saying that it [...] "starts to lose momentum in its midsection as the turnover of interchangeable band members takes on a slightly Groundhog Day feel. In a break from rockumentary tradition, LaCoeur and Riggle fail to unearth any backstage dirt or drama here." [...] He complained that the portions on Stevenson's relationship {{with his father and}} health issues [...] "are serious episodes, but largely unrelated to the story. Coming so late in an otherwise light-hearted film, this tonal shift feels like a clumsy bid to add grit and gravitas." [...] Finally, he felt that Filmage failed to place the Descendents and All in a wider context, saying [...] "it feels limited in its lack of social or historical context beyond the band’s personal story, with almost zero examination of underground hardcore rock as a reaction against mainstream pop culture in Reagan-era America. Even if Descendents had little personal interest in the politics of punk, {{they were part of a}} wider movement that deserves a more searching film than this." [...] Postmedia News reviewer Jay Stone felt similarly about the segments focusing on Stevenson, remarking that while he [...] "emerges as the key character in Filmage" [...] and forms the film's human interest story, [...] "his personal history, including problems with a distant father and some health issues, is slipped so casually into Filmage that it <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> realize what we’re seeing. Stevenson’s medical miracle is worth a movie of its own, but in the world of punk music documentaries, it’s just a sidebar." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 6 September 2010, Body Talk Pt. 2 was {{released}} in the UK. It was preceded by the lead single, a dance version of [...] "Hang with Me" [...] from Body Talk Pt. 1, on 5 September. The album includes a duet with American rapper Snoop Dogg, [...] "U Should Know Better". Robyn performed [...] "Dancing on My Own" [...] with deadmau5 at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on 12 September. In a BBC Newsbeat interview, Robyn explained her decision to release three albums in one year: [...] "It was just something I felt like I needed to do. I just never thought about selling records or not, making this decision. I just did it for myself. It's a way of, for me, to stay inspired {{and to be able}} to do the things I like to do". She said that she would not do it again: [...] "When you do 16 or 13 songs in one go, you kind of empty yourself, and it <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> fill back up and have new things to talk about, so I think it's good for everyone". Robyn announced the release of the single, [...] "Indestructible", on 13 October 2010; an acoustic version appeared on Body Talk Pt. 2. The song {{was released}} on 17 November in Scandinavia and 22 November in the UK. Co-written by Klas Åhlund, it was described as a [...] "pulsating full power version [...] takes every ounce of that emotion and wraps it up in another exceptional disco-pop record worthy of any dance-floor or passion-laden sing-a-long." [...] Robyn planned to collaborate with Swedish producer Max Martin on the song, [...] "Time Machine"; Martin produced Robyn's US singles [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love", both of which peaked in the top 10 on the Billboard 100 in 1997. Combined, the Body Talk albums have sold 91,000 copies in the US ...|$|E
