40|$|This study {{provides}} a <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> design guideline based on measurements of hand gripping diameter. Anthropometric measurements on hands of 60 participants were collected with a caliper. The {{results in the}} current study concluded the guidelines for handle design, including: (1) a definition of handle design was depended on the users’ hand length and hand breadth, (2) different gender would affect the size of <b>tool</b> <b>handle,</b> (3) the handle length at least should be 100 mm, (4) the cross-section handle of elliptical shape was better for gripping, and (5) the best ratio of handle cross-section with width and length should be 1 : 1. 25. These findings can serve as references for <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> design, and improve comfort for users...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a prototype anthropomorphic kinesthetic telepresence {{system that is}} being developed at JPL. It utilizes dexterous terminus devices {{in the form of}} an exoskeleton force-sensing master glove worn by the operator and a replica four finger anthropomorphic slave hand. The newly developed master glove is integrated with our previously developed non-anthropomorphic six degree of freedom (DOF) universal force-reflecting hand controller (FRHC). The mechanical hand and forearm are mounted to an industrial robot (PUMA 560), replacing its standard forearm. The notion of 'terminus control mode' refers to the fact that only the terminus devices (glove and robot hand) are of anthropomorphic nature, and the master and slave arms are non-anthropomorphic. The system is currently being evaluated, focusing on <b>tool</b> <b>handling</b> and astronaut equivalent task executions. The evaluation revealed the system's potential for <b>tool</b> <b>handling</b> but it also became evident that hand tool manipulations and space operations require a dual arm robot. This paper describes the system's principal components, its control and computing architecture, discusses findings of the <b>tool</b> <b>handling</b> evaluation, and explains why common <b>tool</b> <b>handling</b> and EVA space tasks require dual arm robots...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{whether the}} perceived roughness {{of the end}} of a tool is influenced by the texture of the handle used to hold it. Participants rated the roughness of the ends (caps) of a series of tools by rubbing them along their forearm, and indicated the perceived roughness of the tool's cap by means of an anchored visual scale. The caps of the tools had one of eight different levels of roughness varying from very smooth (sample 1) to very rough (sample 8). The participants held the <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> in one hand while rubbing the cap of the tool against their contralateral forearm. The <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> was either smooth (similar in smoothness to sample 1) or else very rough (matched in roughness to sample 8). Overall, participants were remarkably good at ignoring the roughness of the <b>tool's</b> <b>handle</b> when discriminating the roughness of the tool's cap. Nevertheless, the roughness of the <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> was shown to modulate roughness judgments concerning the tool cap under certain conditions: in particular, tool caps at the rougher end of the scale (6 and 7) were rated as being significantly less rough when the participants held tools with a rough handle than when they held tools with a smooth handle. Our results therefore demonstrate a small but significant effect of the roughness of the <b>handle</b> of a <b>tool</b> on the perceived roughness of its cap...|$|R

25|$|The heavy, {{close-grained}} yellow-orange wood is very {{dense and}} is prized for <b>tool</b> <b>handles,</b> treenails, fence posts, and other applications requiring a strong dimensionally stable wood that withstands rot. Although its wood is commonly knotty and twisted, straight-grained Osage orange timber makes very good bows. In Arkansas, {{in the early}} 19th century, a good Osage bow was worth a horse and a blanket. Additionally, a yellow-orange dye can be extracted from the wood, {{which can be used}} as a substitute for fustic and aniline dyes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to design and test a {{mechanical}} DC torque tool testing rig that is capable of simulating dynamic response of the human arm under a torque impulse. The mechanical simulation of the human arm response is based on a nonlinear model derived from human subject testing. The testing rig, which uses both tension and compression springs to provide a bilinear stiffness rate to resist the motion of the torque <b>tool</b> <b>handle,</b> is used to analyze the <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> angular displacement and reaction force, which has been strongly linked in previous studies to operator discomfort and injury. The mechanical simulation of the human arm response was tested under a number of different conditions, and compared to an analytical nonlinear model. The results showed that the mechanical simulation consistently underestimated the <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> displacement by up to 16. 2 % when compared to the nonlinear model predictions. The discrepancy in handle displacement between the nonlinear model and mechanical simulation is likely due the coulomb friction not being included in the nonlinear model. Therefore, this study shows that by suing an offset to compensate for the coulomb friction, the tool testing rig can be used to accurately simulate the nonlinear dynamic response of the human arm under...|$|R

25|$|Wood {{is used in}} {{thousands}} of ways, e.g. buildings, furniture, boats, airplanes, wagons, car parts, musical instruments, sports equipment, railroad ties, utility poles, fence posts, pilings, toothpicks, matches, plywood, coffins, shingles, barrel staves, toys, <b>tool</b> <b>handles,</b> picture frames, veneer, charcoal and firewood. Wood pulp is widely used to make paper, paperboard, cellulose sponges, cellophane and some important plastics and textiles, such as cellulose acetate and rayon. Bamboo stems also have hundreds of uses, including paper, buildings, furniture, boats, musical instruments, fishing poles, water pipes, plant stakes, and scaffolding. Trunks of palm trees and tree ferns are often used for building. Stems of Reed are an important building material for use in thatching in some areas.|$|E

2500|$|Hornbeams yield a {{very hard}} timber, giving rise to the name [...] "ironwood". Dried {{heartwood}} billets are nearly white and are suitable for decorative use. For general carpentry, hornbeam is rarely used, {{partly due to the}} difficulty of working it. The wood is used to construct carving boards, <b>tool</b> <b>handles,</b> handplane soles, coach wheels, piano actions, shoe lasts, and other products where a very tough, hard wood is required. The wood can also be used as gear pegs in simple machines, including traditional windmills. It is sometimes coppiced to provide hardwood poles.

40|$|The use {{of tools}} is still widely {{appreciated}} in industries at various levels. The range of their application varies {{from a simple}} task like hammering to a complicated, complex and precision-demanding tasks {{such as that of}} surgical scalpels. Hence, it becomes highly essential to design the tool for ‘comfort’ from the perspective of user. The aim {{of this study is to}} design a <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> for a task involving a simple power grip such as hammer. The focus of this study is mainly confined to identify the right cross-section and profile of the <b>tool</b> <b>handle,</b> based on subjective experimentation of a group of subjects and find the approximate dimension and shape(of both cross-section and profile) which outstands in subject’s perception of comfort. In this study, a new criteria for decision making has been employed during a brief subjective analysis to find out the better cross- section shape among the various possible shapes for the handle. The shape of the profile has been reverse engineered from an existing <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> using a CAD software which was been rated high in market. At various turns during this study, new simplified approaches were used to accomplish certain tasks which can be considered as reasonable approximation to standard methods. The final step is to evaluate the design which has been perceived most comfortable by the subjects, using a subjective analysis through hand-mapping of discomfort...|$|R
