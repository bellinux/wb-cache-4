5|$|In another study, synesthetes were {{prompted}} to form novel synesthetic associations to graphemes never seen before. Synesthetes created those associations within minutes or seconds - which was time <b>too</b> <b>short</b> {{to account for}} creation of new physical connections between color representation and grapheme representation areas in the brain, pointing again towards ideasthesia.|$|E
5|$|Series 4 {{also saw}} host Theakston ask Geri Halliwell {{out to dinner}} live on air during a Q with The Spice Girls. Newspaper reports have since stated however that he later turned her down for being <b>too</b> <b>short.</b>|$|E
5|$|A 2007 study {{suggested}} that Massospondylus {{may have used}} its short arms for defense against predators ("defensive swats"), in intraspecies combat, or in feeding, although its arms were <b>too</b> <b>short</b> to reach its mouth. Scientists speculate that Massospondylus could have used its large pollex (thumb) claw in combat, to strip plant material from trees, digging, or for grooming.|$|E

5|$|According {{to another}} urban legend, daddy long legs (Pholcidae) have potent venom, but their fangs are <b>too</b> <b>short</b> {{to deliver the}} poison.

In a 2004 episode of Discovery Channel's MythBusters, it was shown that host Adam Savage survived a bite from the spider.|$|E
5|$|Cold Fear was {{met with}} mixed reviews, with many critics {{comparing}} it unfavorably to Resident Evil 4. Although critics were generally impressed with the environments and the opening scenes, they found the game <b>too</b> <b>short</b> and felt it {{failed to live up}} to its promising beginning. The game was a commercial failure; by February 2006, it had sold only 70,000 units across all three platforms in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{winning the}} Jack Adams Award as top coach and being {{popular with the}} Sabres fanbase, Nolan was only offered a one-year {{contract}} extension by replacement GM Darcy Regier. He rejected this under {{the grounds that it}} was <b>too</b> <b>short,</b> and decided to part ways with the franchise. This upset many fans, who blamed Nolan's departure on Hašek's alleged attempt to rid him.|$|E

5|$|I'm {{giving you}} an example of how I think every woman should feel about herself. No matter what anyone tells you – you're too tall, you're <b>too</b> <b>short,</b> you're too big, you're too skinny...there's so many 'rules' to society's view of beauty. I wanted to dispel that and get rid of that. We're all {{beautiful}} in our own unique ways, you just have to find that happy place within yourself. And that's what the record's all about.|$|E
5|$|It {{soon became}} {{apparent}} that Méchain and Delambre's result (443.296lignes) was slightly <b>too</b> <b>short</b> for the meridianal definition of the metre. Arago and Biot extended the survey to the island of Formentera in the western Mediterranean Sea in 1806–1809, and found that one ten-millionth of the Earth's quadrant should be 443.31lignes: later work increased the value to 443.39lignes. The modern value, for the WGS84 reference spheroid, is m or lignes.|$|E

5|$|Managing {{to right}} himself, he became faint from the {{escaping}} gas and lashed {{himself to the}} ropes to prevent a fall.

However the ropes had become tangled and the hooks were <b>too</b> <b>short.</b>|$|E
5|$|Studies by Phil Senter in 2007 {{conducted}} on P. neimongoliensis and P. mongoliensis {{concluded that the}} forelimbs of these taxa (and likely those of other Psittacosaurus species) were <b>too</b> <b>short</b> (only about 58% {{as long as the}} hindlimbs) to reach the ground, and their range of motion indicates they could neither be pronated nor generate propulsive force for locomotion, suggesting that Psittacosaurus was entirely bipedal. The forelimbs were also <b>too</b> <b>short</b> to be used in digging or bringing food to the mouth, and Senter suggested that if Psittacosaurus needed to dig depressions in the ground it may have used its hindlimbs instead. The forelimbs could be used for two-handed grasping of objects or scratching the body, but due to their extremely limited flexibility and reach, they could have only been used to grasp objects very close to the belly or sides of the animal and could have scratched only the belly, flank and knees. Even though the hands could not reach the mouth, Psittacosaurus could have still used them to carry nesting material or food to a desired location.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog was {{developed}} {{for its ability to}} encourage reluctant cattle to travel long distances and may be the best breed in the world for this work.

5|$|The PC and Macintosh {{versions}} of Star Wars: Dark Forces were well received, with the MS-DOS version holding an aggregate score on GameRankings of 77%. Publications compared Dark Forces to Doom, a significant video {{game in the}} first-person shooter genre at the time, but also indicated that Dark Forces improved upon Dooms features. Criticisms {{tended to focus on}} the game being <b>too</b> <b>short,</b> as well as lacking a multiplayer feature.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was assigned the airport's runway 22 for the takeoff, but used runway 26 instead. Runway 26 was <b>too</b> <b>short</b> {{for a safe}} takeoff, causing the aircraft to overrun {{the end of the}} runway before it could become airborne. It crashed just past the end of the runway, killing all 47 passengers and two of the three crew. The flight's first officer was the only survivor.|$|E
