5|$|Digital Dimension {{worked on}} 200 visual effects {{shots in the}} film, {{including}} the sequence that shows characters John McClane and Matt Farrell crouching between two cars as another car lands {{on top of the}} other cars. To achieve this effect, a crane yanked the car and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the air onto the two cars that were also being pulled by cables. The shot was completed when the two characters were integrated into the footage of the car stunt after the lighting was adjusted and CGI glass and debris were added. In the same sequence, John McClane destroys a helicopter that several of Gabriel's henchman are riding in by ramming it with a car. This was accomplished by first filming one take where one of Gabriel's henchman, Rand, jumps from the helicopter, and in the next take the car is propelled into the stationary helicopter as it is hoisted by wires. The final view of the shot overlays the two takes, with added CGI for the debris and moving rotor blades. The company also assisted in adding cars for traffic collisions and masses of people for evacuations from several government buildings.|$|E
5|$|The Browns next {{played the}} Rockets {{for a second}} time in as many weeks, this time in Cleveland. The Rockets opened the scoring with a 74-yard pass from quarterback Jesse Freitas to {{receiver}} Eddie Prokop in the first four minutes of the game, and added a field goal by Jim McCarthy {{near the end of the}} second quarter. The Browns did not score in the first half, but came back to win the game in the second. Rockets defenders were double-teaming Cleveland's ends, and the Browns adjusted by sending halfbacks out to receive deep passes. Cleveland halfbacks Dub Jones and Bill Boedeker both caught long touchdown passes from Graham in the third quarter. Boedeker ran in for another touchdown in the fourth quarter to make the final score 21–10. As in the previous game, there were several cases of rough play: tackle Lou Rymkus was ejected from the game for hitting Jim Pearcy of the Rockets. A Rockets player picked up a handful of sand from the stadium's baseball infield and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Mac Speedie's face during the game, temporarily blinding him. Hirsch was accidentally kicked by a Browns player and suffered a skull fracture.|$|E
25|$|In spring 1138, {{the royal}} army invaded the Principality of Capua, with the precise intent of {{avoiding}} a pitched battle and of dispersing Ranulf's army {{with a series}} of marches through difficult terrain. While the count of Alife hesitated, Roger, now supported by Benevento, destroyed all the rebels' castles in the region, capturing an immense booty. Ranulf himself, who had taken refuge in his capital Troia, died of malaric fever on 30 April 1139. Later, Roger exhumed his body from his grave in Troia cathedral and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a ditch, only to repent subsequently and rebury him decently.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year, once Hitler {{had become}} Chancellor, Rosenberg was named {{leader of the}} Nazi Party's foreign political office, but he played little practical part in the role. Another event of 1933 was Rosenberg's visit to Britain, intended {{to give the impression}} that the Nazis would not be a threat and to encourage links between the new regime and the British Empire. It was a notable failure. When Rosenberg laid a wreath bearing a swastika at the Cenotaph, a Labour Party candidate slashed it and later <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the Thames and was fined 40 shillings for willful damage at Bow Street magistrate’s court. In January 1934 Hitler granted Rosenberg responsibility for the spiritual and philosophical education of the Party and all related organizations.|$|E
25|$|Zindler made {{local and}} {{national}} headlines when he and reporter Larry Conners closed the Chicken Ranch in Fayette County, Texas, near La Grange, after he reported on it in 1973. The Chicken Ranch story was featured in a 1973 edition of Texas Monthly magazine, two 1974 issues of Playboy magazine, {{was the basis for}} the Broadway and film musical The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, and served as the basis of the song La Grange by ZZ Top. The closing did not go well with the sheriff of Fayette County, Jim T. Flournoy, who later attacked Zindler in a fight that left Zindler with two fractured ribs, along with a snatched toupee. Reportedly, Flournoy waved the hairpiece in the air {{as if it were a}} prized enemy scalp and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the street.|$|E
25|$|Lin also seriously {{attempted}} {{to withdraw from}} the nomination, but was not able to do so because Mao had made Lin's appointment a decision of the Central Committee, so rejecting the position would violate Party procedure and would risk ending Lin's political career. Lin was not present at the conference where it was decided to name him vice chairman. After Lin was named, he met with Mao and begged him personally not to name him to the position, but Mao criticized him, comparing Lin to the Ming emperor Shizong, who devoted so much of his time to the search for longevity medicines that he neglected his government responsibilities. In 1966 all other candidates for the position were removed, and Lin accepted the position as sole Vice-Chairman, replacing Liu Shaoqi as Mao's unofficial successor. After his appointment, Lin again {{attempted to}} submit a formal written request to Mao, asking Mao to rescind Lin's appointment to the position of vice-chairman, but Mao again rejected this request. When Lin received the rejection letter, he was so angry that he tore the letter up and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the garbage.|$|E

500|$|Several {{students}} were fined ₤5 by the magistrate, Paul Taylor, at South-West London Police Court in Battersea. This triggered another protest two days later, when 1,000 medical students from UCL, King's, Guy's and the West Middlesex hospitals marched along the Strand toward King's College, waving miniature brown dogs on sticks and a life-sized effigy of the magistrate, and singing, [...] "Let's hang Paul Taylor on a sour apple tree / As we go marching on." [...] The Times {{reported that they}} tried to burn the effigy but, unable to light it, <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the Thames instead.|$|E
500|$|The trial resumed on January 16, 2004, {{when the}} Naha court {{accepted}} {{the evidence of}} Brown's spinal and neck injuries. Takaesu testified {{that it would have}} been physically impossible for Brown to commit a violent sexual assault on V. N.. When Takaesu called for the clothing V. N. wore the night of the alleged assault to be entered as evidence, the prosecutor, Tsuyoshi Satake, refused to present it. During a hearing in March, Brown admitted that he had lied to Japanese police about what had happened on the night in question. Brown stated that he and V. N. had engaged in some [...] "heavy petting" [...] in her car and that she objected when he began to take it [...] "too far". After Brown said that he insulted her, she threatened to call the police and he grabbed her cell phone and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the river.|$|E
500|$|Nirvana first {{played the}} song {{the night before}} it was demoed. Bassist Krist Novoselic {{recalled}} that it [...] "originally sounded like a Bad Brains song. Then Kurt {{turned it into a}} pop song". Cobain went home and reworked the song, playing the revised version of it over the phone to Novoselic. The band recorded [...] "In Bloom" [...] with producer Butch Vig at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin during April 1990. The material recorded at Smart Studios was intended for the group's second album for the independent record label Sub Pop. The song originally had a bridge section that Vig removed. Novoselic said that after the band recorded the song, Vig cut out the bridge from the 16-track master tape with a razor blade and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the garbage. The songs from these sessions were placed on a demo tape that circulated amongst the music industry, generating interest in the group among major record labels.|$|E

500|$|In July 1943, Groves {{prepared}} to issue Public Proclamation No. 2, declaring the site a military exclusion area. He asked Marshall {{to present it}} to the Governor of Tennessee, Prentice Cooper. Marshall, in turn, delegated the task to the area engineer, Major Thomas T. Crenshaw, who sent a junior officer, Captain George B. Leonard. Cooper was unimpressed; he told Leonard {{that he had not}} been informed about the purpose of the CEW, and that the Army had kicked the farmers off their land and had not compensated the counties for the roads and bridges, which would now be closed. In his opinion it was [...] "an experiment in socialism", a New Deal project being undertaken {{in the name of the}} war effort. Instead of reading the proclamation, he tore it up and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a waste paper basket. Marshall went to Nashville to apologize to Cooper, who refused to talk to him. Nichols, who succeeded Marshall as chief engineer of the Manhattan District, met Cooper on 31 July, and offered compensation in the form of Federal financing for road improvements. Cooper accepted an offer from Nichols to visit the CEW, which he did on 3 November.|$|E
2500|$|Joe Sheridan, {{who scored}} the {{controversial}} goal, described {{how he had}} done it: [...] "It was well-worked {{and it was a}} definite goal. People are saying I <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in,</b> but I was heading for the line and I just dropped the ball and it was in the net. I got it and the lad just pushed me into the net. I tried to do whatever I could to hit it and the goal was given, simple as that. I was pushed in over the line so it should have been a penalty anyway. I think it was a perfect goal".|$|E
2500|$|Wei Yan {{was left}} with only his son(s) and a few followers. They fled towards Hanzhong Commandery. Yang Yi ordered Ma Dai to give chase. Ma Dai caught up with Wei Yan, decapitated him, brought his head back, and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> front of Yang Yi. Yang Yi trampled on Wei Yan's head and said, [...] "You {{inferior}} slave! Now, can you still commit evil?" [...] Wei Yan's family members and close relatives were also executed. Before Wei Yan's death, Jiang Wan had led divisions of the imperial guards from Chengdu {{to deal with the}} conflict. They had travelled for about 10 li (about three miles) when they received news of Wei Yan's death, after which they returned to Chengdu.|$|E

2500|$|Heracles {{had visited}} Chiron to gain {{advice on how}} to catch the boar, and Chiron had told him to drive it into thick snow, which sets this Labour in mid-winter. [...] Having {{successfully}} caught the Boar, Heracles bound it and carried it back to Eurystheus, who was frightened of it and ducked down in his half-buried storage pithos, begging Heracles {{to get rid of the}} beast, a favourite subject for the vase-painters. Heracles obliged. Roger Lancelyn Green states in his Tales of the Greek Heroes that Heracles <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the sea. It then swam to Italy, where its tusks were preserved in the Temple of Apollo at Cumae. Three days later, Eurystheus, still trembling with fear, sent Heracles to clean the Augean stables.|$|E
2500|$|Decisions {{were made}} by voting without any time set aside for deliberation. Nothing, however, stopped jurors from talking informally among {{themselves}} during the voting procedure and juries could be unruly, shouting out their disapproval or disbelief of things said by the litigants. This may have had some role in building a consensus. The voting procedure was public and transparent. Each heliast had received two votes, one [...] "not guilty" [...] and one [...] "guilty". Then the herald (κήρυξ) would, first, ask the heliasts {{if they wanted to}} submit any objections against the witnesses and, then, he would call them to cast their votes in two different amphoras, one of copper for the [...] "non-guilty" [...] votes and one of wood for the [...] "guilty" [...] votes. The voting was secret, since each juror had to cover the vote with his fingers, so that nobody could see in which amphora he <b>threw</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> the civil cases the voting procedure was different, because the amphoras were as many as the litigant parties and the jurors had to vindicate one of them by casting their vote.|$|E
2500|$|By New Year 1924, Bow {{defied the}} possessive Maxine Alton {{and brought her}} father to Hollywood. Bow remembered their reunion: [...] "I didn't care a rap, for (Maxine Alton), or B. P. Schulberg, or my motion picture career, or Clara Bow, I just threw myself {{into his arms and}} kissed and kissed him, and we both cried like a couple of fool kids. Oh, it was wonderful." [...] Bow felt Alton had misused her trust: [...] "She wanted to keep a hold on me so she made me think I wasn't getting over and that nothing but her clever {{management}} kept me going." [...] Bow and her father moved in at 1714 North Kingsley Drive in Hollywood, together with Jacobson, who by then also worked for Preferred. When Schulberg learned of this arrangement, he fired Jacobson for potentially getting [...] "his big star" [...] into a scandal. When Bow found out, [...] "She tore up her contract and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> his face and told him he couldn't run her private life." [...] Jacobson concluded, [...] " [...] was the sweetest girl in the world, but you didn't cross her and you didn't do her wrong." [...] On September 7, 1924, The Los Angeles Times, in a significant article [...] "A dangerous little devil is Clara, impish, appealing, but oh, how she can act!", her father is titled [...] "business manager" [...] and Jacobson referred to as her brother.|$|E
