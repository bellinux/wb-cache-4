25|$|Thomas Sprat {{wrote his}} History of the Royal Society in 1667 and set forth, {{in a single}} document, the goals of {{empirical}} science ever after. He expressed grave suspicions of adjectives, nebulous terminology, and all language that might be subjective. He praised a spare, clean, and precise vocabulary for science and explanations that are as comprehensible as possible. In Sprat's account, the Royal Society explicitly rejected anything <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> scholasticism. For Sprat, as {{for a number of}} the founders of the Royal Society, science was Protestant: its reasons and explanations had to be comprehensible to all. There would be no priests in science, and anyone could reproduce the experiments and hear their lessons. Similarly, he emphasised the need for conciseness in description, as well as reproducibility of experiments.|$|E

This round of touring ended in February 1994, and then in March 1994 the band moved on to Europe. The band began a theater tour in the United States on May 27, 1994. The opening acts were Tad and Eleven. In late 1994, after touring in support of Superunknown, doctors {{discovered}} that Cornell had severely strained his vocal cords. Soundgarden cancelled several shows to avoid causing any permanent damage. Cornell said, [...] "I think we kinda overdid it!

500|$|... "Yellow" [...] {{was written}} in [...] Rockfield studio in Wales called the Quadrangle, where Coldplay began working on their debut album, Parachutes. One night after {{finishing}} recording [...] "Shiver", the band took a break and {{went out of the}} studio. Outside, there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and [...] "just amazing", according to the song's co-producer, Ken Nelson. He told the band to look at the stars, which they did. Lead singer Chris Martin was inspired by the sight and the song's main melody, consisting of a chord pattern, popped into his head. At first, Martin did not take it seriously [...] "as he relayed the tune {{to the rest of the}} band in his worst Neil Young impersonation voice". Martin has said, [...] "The song had the word 'stars' and <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice." [...] The melody [...] "started off a lot slower", according to drummer Will Champion, and it sounded like a Neil Young song. Not long after, despite not taking the song seriously, Martin's idea worked out when he had developed the tempo of the verse. When guitarist Jonny Buckland started playing it and supplemented it with his ideas, they had created the riff, [...] "and it sort of got a bit heavier".|$|E

500|$|In 1971, vocalist David Johansen {{formed the}} New York Dolls with guitarists Johnny Thunders and Rick Rivets, bassist Arthur Kane, and drummer Billy Murcia; Rivets was {{replaced}} by Sylvain Sylvain in 1972. The band {{was meant to be}} a temporary project for the members, who were club-going youths that had gone to New York City with different career pursuits. As Sylvain recalled, [...] "We just said 'Hey, maybe this will get us some chicks.' <b>That</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a good enough reason." [...] He and Murcia originally planned to work in the clothing business and opened a boutique on Lexington Avenue that was across the street from a toy repair shop called the New York Dolls Hospital, which gave them the idea for their name. The group soon began playing regularly in lower Manhattan and earned a cult following within a few months with their reckless style of rock music. Nonetheless, record companies were hesitant to sign them because of their onstage cross-dressing and blatant vulgarity. In October 1972, they garnered the interest of critics when they opened for English rock band the Faces at the Empire Pool in Wembley. However, on the New York Dolls' first tour of England that year, Murcia died after consuming a lethal combination of alcohol and methaqualone. They enlisted Jerry Nolan as his replacement, while managers Marty Thau, Steve Leber, and David Krebs still struggled to find the band a record deal.|$|E
500|$|Yankee outfielder Bob Cerv {{recalled}} of the rivalry, [...] "I {{always remember}} the games when Pierce and Ford would lock up. Those were great ballgames – 2–1, 3–2. Usually, if they'd get beat, Mantle would {{hit a home}} run." [...] New York outfielder Hank Bauer noted, [...] "The guy who gave me the most problem – I know he gave 'em to me, and I think he gave 'em {{to most of us}} – was Billy Pierce." [...] Tommy Byrne, who pitched for the Yankees for most of his career from 1943 to 1957 but played for Chicago {{for the first half of}} the 1953 season, said, [...] "Pierce was sneaky fast, a good breaking ball. He was tough. For several years there he was right up there on a par with Ford." [...] Sportswriter Bill Madden recalled in 1982, [...] "Always it was Pierce against Whitey Ford and always, to me, <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> an unfair matchup. They were your classic 'stylish' left-handers, equal in guile and guts, but Ford had those howitzers of Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Bill Skowron and Hank Bauer behind him, while Pierce came armed with popguns. Nellie Fox, Luis Aparicio and Minnie Miñoso supported him with hustle and chink singles and I always marveled at the fact that Pierce could duel Ford on even terms despite those odds." [...] Ironically, the Yankees tried to acquire Pierce in the early 1950s when Ford was in the military, but White Sox general manager Frank Lane proposed that New York give up Bauer, first baseman Joe Collins and second baseman Jerry Coleman in exchange for Pierce and outfielder Al Zarilla, and ended talks when Yankees GM George Weiss suggested the Yankees send minor leaguers instead.|$|E
500|$|Mars {{had been}} filming the music video for [...] "Gorilla" [...] as he {{announced}} on his Twitter account, on October 2, 2013. He said [...] "Sorry i've been M.I.A, I was shooting a music video. #WinkWink #FRIKIKIKIKI #BangBang Wait {{till you see}} this". It was directed by Mars' himself and regular collaborator Cameron Duddy. On October 10, 2013 it was announced on Bruno Mars' official website, {{leading up to the}} release of the video, the unveil of teasers every day via Mars' Instagram account. The teasers included a car parked in front of a strip club, a reptile, and an angry boss played by Luis Guzmán. Duddy along with Mars sought to create [...] "more than a standard strip-club video" [...] by researching and going into strip clubs to appreciate the architecture of the local. Nevertheless, the search for the ideal strip club was fruitless, so Mars and Duddy decided to build one: [...] "a joint <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> it was lifted straight out of Havana, dark and sweaty and seemingly untouched by time. They painted the walls themselves, and went back and forth on just what color neon they should use". When the time came to cast someone to play a stripper, the only name was Freida Pinto's one. However, Duddy had some doubts her choice, since he considered her [...] "safe". To this, Mars replied [...] "it's important to use someone who hasn't been seen in this light before". All in all, Duddy confessed that he trusted Mars instincts regarding Pinto's choice for the role. Duddy explained that some scenes recorded for the video were dangerous. Pinto could have harmed herself in the scene where [...] "she sheds her clothes among a sea of sparks", as well as Mars' guitar player [...] "He got dangerously close to having his head burned". Muriel Villera starts as one of the jealous strippers. The official music video was set to premiere on October 14, 2013. Nevertheless, its release was delayed one day by Mars himself stating [...] "I want it to be the best it can be. With that being said, I need one more day". The video, finally arrived on October 15, 2013 exclusively via Facebook.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{example of}} gorillas' {{significant}} intelligence is {{their ability to}} comprehend simple sign language. In the mid-1970s, researchers {{turned their attention to}} communicating with gorillas via sign language. One gorilla, Koko, was born in San Francisco Zoo on July 4, 1971. A woman named Francine Patterson officially started working with Koko on July 12, 1972, with the goal of teaching her sign language. In the beginning, Dr. Petterson focused on teaching Koko only three basic signs: [...] "food," [...] "drink," [...] and [...] "more." [...] Koko would learn signs through observation, Dr. Patterson, or one of her colleagues by molding Koko's hands into the correct sign. On August 7, Patterson began a more formal routine of teaching Koko the signs, [...] "food," [...] "drink," [...] and [...] "more." [...] In the couple weeks before that, Koko had been using gestures <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> attempts at the signs taught, but were deemed as coincidental and random and not intended for the actual purpose. Only two days after they started the more formal routine, Koko started responding consistently with the sign [...] "food" [...] when prompted to. Within the first three months, Koko made 16 different combinations of signs and was also starting to form simple questions by using eye contact and different positioning of signs by the body. Koko mastered more than 1,000 signs and was said to be able to connect up to 8 words together to form a statement expressing wants, needs, thoughts, or simple responses. Today, Koko resides at The Gorilla Foundation in Woodside, California.|$|E

In spite of all the positive reception, Pocket Gamer's Jon Jordan commented that it wasn't the [...] "most welcoming or spectacular game in the DSi Shop" [...] due to its [...] "plonky music" [...] and [...] "8-bit inspiration". Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell, in his impressions of PiCOPiCT, commented on the presentation, calling the visuals [...] "warm" [...] and the soundtrack [...] "immersive". Similarly, GameSpot's Tom Mc Shea found fault in the title; while he enjoyed the Nintendo cameos and the concept behind the game, he found the controls imprecise and the difficulty too high.|$|E
