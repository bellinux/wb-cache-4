5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle was not {{a primary}} {{strategic}} target for Scottish attack, as it was positioned away from the main routes through the region, but it was kept well garrisoned during the Scottish wars. The surrounding manor of Embleton had nonetheless suffered from Scottish raids and Gaunt had concerns over {{the condition of the}} castle's defences, ordering the building of additional fortifications around the gatehouse. Part of the surrounding lands around the castle may have been brought into agricultural production at this time, either <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> growing garrison, or to protect the crops against Scottish attacks.|$|E
5|$|Predatory wasp species {{normally}} subdue {{their prey}} by stinging it, and then either {{lay their eggs}} on it, leaving it in place, or carry it back to their nest where an egg may be laid on the prey item and the nest sealed, or several smaller prey items may be deposited <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> single developing larva. Apart from providing food for their offspring, no further maternal care is given. Members of the family Chrysididae, the cuckoo wasps, are kleptoparasites and lay their eggs in the nests of unrelated host species.|$|E
5|$|Radau {{returns to}} food, {{describing}} sago and the breadfruit tree. The breadfruit tastes like Yorkshire pudding or mashed potato; with meat {{it is the}} best of vegetables; with sugar, milk, butter or molasses, it is a delicious pudding with a special flavour; Radau hopes that perhaps it will one day be found in European markets. As for the sago palm, one tree yields 1,800 cakes, enough <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> man for a year.|$|E

5|$|Staffa {{lies about}} 10kilometres (6mi) west of Mull, and 9km {{northeast}} of Iona. It is longitudinally oriented north-south, {{and is a}} kilometre long by about half a kilometre wide. The circumference is about 3.8km in extent. In the northeast the isle shelves to a shore, but otherwise the coast is rugged and much indented; numerous caves have been carved out by rain, streams and sea. There is enough grass <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> few cattle, and the island has a spring.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{includes}} a multiplayer mode, where up to four players can compete {{against each other in}} seven different game types: Beach, Raptor, Heist, War, Tank, Race and Deathmatch. In Beach, some players must go up through a beach and into a waiting escape vehicle, while others must stop them by firing at them from fixed positions. Raptor involves players controlling raptors <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> baby dinosaur, while others play as cavemen that have to steal dinosaur eggs. Heist engrosses players in the robbery of a bank, where the goal is to retrieve a cash bag {{from the center of the}} level and run with it to the team's vault without being damaged. War can either be a traditional capture the flag mode or Total War, where players have to get the other teams gas canister and use it to release a chemical gas that annihilates the enemy. Similarly, in Tank players fight against each other by using tanks and grabbing chemical canisters that can release a lethal corrosive gas, destroying all the tanks that are outdoors. Race is a racing mode which provides two variations of the same course. Items can be acquired and used against opponents. Finally, there is a standard deathmatch mode where players fight against each other in shooting style from a third-person perspective. Players can set a number of different options for each game, such as score limit, number of lives, and inclusion of optional bots.|$|E

25|$|Horses require {{access to}} clean fresh water at all times, {{and access to}} {{adequate}} forage such as grass or hay. Unless an animal can be fully maintained on pasture with a natural open water source, horses must be fed daily.

25|$|At {{the time}} of the {{beginning}} of the diamond industry, all of South Africa was experiencing depressed economic conditions. Ostrich-farming was in its infancy, and agriculture had only been lightly developed. The Boers, except those in the immediate vicinity of Cape Town, lived in impoverished conditions. They only traded marginally with the Colony for durable goods. Even the British colonists were far from wealthy. The diamond industry was therefore considerably attractive, especially to colonists of British origin. It was also a means to demonstrate that South Africa, which appeared to be barren and poor on the surface, was rich below the ground. It takes ten acres (40,000m²) of Karoo <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> sheep, but it was now possible that a few square metres of diamantiferous blue ground would be able <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> dozen families. By the end of 1871, a large population had already gathered on the diamond fields, and immigration increased dramatically, which brought in many newcomers. Among the first to seek a fortune on the diamond fields was Cecil Rhodes.|$|E

Unopened baby food in jars will have a safety button that is down. A jar of baby food that is swelling, leaking, contain chipped glass is probably not safe <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> baby. Some baby food comes in pouches.

25|$|Carbon {{arc lamps}} were started by making contact between two carbon electrodes, {{which were then}} {{separated}} to within a narrow gap. Because the carbon burned away, the gap had to be constantly readjusted. Several mechanisms were developed to regulate the arc. A common approach was <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> carbon electrode by gravity and maintain the gap {{with a pair of}} electromagnets, one of which retracted the upper carbon after the arc was started and the second controlled a brake on the gravity feed.|$|E
25|$|In 1845, 24% of all Irish tenant farms were of 0.4–2hectares (1–5acres) in size, while 40% were of 2–6hectares (5–15acres). Holdings were {{so small}} that no crop other than {{potatoes}} would suffice <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> family. Shortly before the famine the British government reported that poverty was so widespread that one-third of all Irish small holdings could not support their families after paying their rent, except by earnings of seasonal migrant labour in England and Scotland. Following the famine, reforms were implemented making it illegal to further divide land holdings.|$|E

25|$|As noted above, {{the poverty}} {{thresholds}} {{used by the}} US government were originally developed during the Johnson administration's War on Poverty initiative in 1963–1964. Mollie Orshansky, the government economist working at the Social Security Administration who developed the thresholds, based the threshold levels {{on the cost of}} purchasing what in the mid-1950s had been determined by the US Department of Agriculture to be the minimal nutritionally-adequate amount of food necessary <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> family. Orshansky multiplied the cost of the food basket by a factor of three, under the assumption that the average family spent one third of its income on food.|$|E

Due to their size, the balloons are easy to track. North Korea has been accused of intercepting the balloons and poisoning their contents to convince its citizens that South Koreans do not have good intentions. Organizations like North Korea Peace responded by substituting food with socks, including a warning and instructions for how to render the poisoned socks harmless. Defector and Korean Peninsula International Peace Organization spokesman Lee Ju-Seong stated in 2012 that one good pair of South Korean socks can be sold for enough corn <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> child for two months.|$|E
25|$|British {{territorial}} {{expansion in}} India throughout the 19th century created an institutional environment that, on paper, guaranteed property rights among the colonisers, encouraged free trade, {{and created a}} single currency with fixed exchange rates, standardised weights and measures and capital markets within the company-held territories. It also established a system of railways and telegraphs, a civil service that aimed {{to be free from}} political interference, a common-law and an adversarial legal system. This coincided with major changes in the world economy– industrialisation, and significant growth in production and trade. However, at the end of colonial rule, India inherited an economy {{that was one of the}} poorest in the developing world, with industrial development stalled, agriculture unable <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>a</b> rapidly growing population, a largely illiterate and unskilled labour force, and extremely inadequate infrastructure.|$|E
