5|$|Moran joined Virginia Reps.

Shortly thereafter, conservative activist James O'Keefe released a video alleging involvement by Moran's {{son in a}} voting fraud discussion; see Voter fraud allegations below.|$|E

5|$|On the {{national}} level, {{the city is}} located in Mississippi's 3rd congressional district, represented by Gregg Harper (R), {{who has been in}} office since 2009. Lauderdale County, home to Meridian, has voted for the Republican candidate in every United States presidential election since 1972. Prior to the shift <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> white area voters supported Democratic Party candidates, as for decades since the late nineteenth century, it was a one-party state.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{same-sex}} marriage license controversy, Davis {{said she and}} her husband switched from the Democratic Party <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b> While speaking with reporters, Davis expressed confidence in the way marriage licenses were now being issued by her office in Morehead, Kentucky. However, Davis warned that should the current situation become an issue, she was prepared to return to jail.|$|E
5|$|The College Republican National Committee (CRNC) is a {{national}} organization for college and university students who support the Republican Party of the United States. The organization is known as an active recruiting tool for the Republican Party and has produced many prominent Republican and conservative activists and introduced more party members <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>party</b> than any other organization in the nation.|$|E

5000|$|Hoover seldom {{mentioned}} {{civil rights}} {{while he was}} President. He believed that African-Americans and other races could improve themselves with education and individual initiative. He opposed federal anti-lynching laws, and when lynchings occurred in the South, including one incident linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party's</b> efforts <b>to</b> 'Republicanize' southern states, he offered only verbal condemnation.|$|R
5|$|The {{effect was}} to {{prohibit}} {{the use of}} public funds by any religious school, although it did not advance Grant’s other aim of requiring states to provide public education to all children. The bill passed the House but failed in the Senate. Although it never passed Congress, and left Blaine open to charges of anti-Catholicism, the proposed amendment served Blaine’s purpose of rallying Protestants <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>party</b> and promoting himself as one of the party’s foremost leaders.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Paul was speculated {{to run for}} {{president}} in 1992 but opted instead to work on the campaign for Pat Buchanan. That year, Marrou received the Libertarian presidential nomination. Paul later returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> and was re-elected to his seat in Congress in 1996, without much support from establishment Republicans, who supported the party-switching Democratic incumbent of the seat. Back in Congress, Paul regained his nickname of Dr. No, favoring a free market and advocating a reduction {{in the size of the}} federal government. He was drafted to challenge President George W. Bush in the 2004 Republican primaries, but chose not to run. He ran {{for president}} again in 2008 and 2012 as a Republican, attracting a large amount of grassroots support.|$|E
5|$|He {{enjoyed a}} {{successful}} post-war career {{working for the}} U.S. government as a diplomat, civil servant, and administrator. His conversion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> and his cooperation with his old friend, President Ulysses S. Grant, as well as critical comments {{he wrote in his}} memoirs about General Lee's wartime performance, made him anathema to many of his former Confederate colleagues. His reputation in the South further suffered when he led African-American militia against the anti-Reconstruction White League at the Battle of Liberty Place in 1874. Authors of the Lost Cause movement focused on Longstreet's actions at Gettysburg as a primary reason for the Confederacy's loss of the war. Since the late 20th century, his reputation has undergone a slow reassessment. Many Civil War historians now consider him among the war's most gifted tactical commanders.|$|E
50|$|For two years, Harper was {{the elected}} Chairman for <b>the</b> Young <b>Republican</b> Federation of California (YRFC) and served on their state board for over ten years. Locally, Harper {{has been elected}} to several terms <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Orange County <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> Central Committee. Harper {{has served on the}} {{executive}} committee for the OCGOP. Statewide, Harper served as the elected Associate Representative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> California <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b> As Associate Representative, Harper was an ex-officio member of the state platform committee. Assemblyman Matthew Harper continues as a delegate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> California <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In June 2016, Johnson {{changed his}} party {{affiliation}} to [...] "No Party", citing his opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party's</b> support for U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump. He stated, [...] "Many {{of the voters}} who elected me are supporting Mr. Trump. I respect that, but disagree that he is qualified <b>to</b> lead <b>the</b> nation and the free world." ...|$|R

5|$|In March 1971, Chotiner {{resigned}} from his White House job {{and returned to}} the private practice of law. He represented former Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa, who had been informally promised early parole from his jury tampering sentence. Chotiner wrote to Haldeman in November 1971, noting that no action on Hoffa's release seemed to be taking place, and President Nixon granted Hoffa clemency later that month. When Chotiner's role became public in 1973, he stated that he was proud of his actions on behalf of Hoffa. Chotiner also lobbied the White House on behalf of milk producers, who were seeking increased price supports and who were major contributors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
5|$|Public {{reaction}} to Reagan was always mixed; the oldest president {{up to that}} time was supported by young voters, and began an alliance that shifted many of them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>party.</b> Reagan did not fare well with minority groups, especially African-Americans. This was largely due to his opposition to affirmative action policies. However, his support of Israel throughout his presidency earned him support from many Jews. He emphasized family values in his campaigns and during his presidency, although he was the first president to have been divorced. The combination of Reagan's speaking style, unabashed patriotism, negotiation skills, as well as his savvy use of the media, {{played an important role in}} defining the 1980s and his future legacy.|$|E
5|$|The state's {{conservative}} {{white voters}} began to support Republican presidential candidates by the mid-20th century. After this period, they supported Republicans for {{local and state}} offices as well, and most whites became Republican Party members. The party also attracted some minorities, but many have continued to vote for Democratic candidates. The shift <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> is much-attributed {{to the fact that}} the Democratic Party became increasingly liberal during the 20th century, and thus increasingly out-of-touch with the average Texas voter. As Texas was always a conservative state, voters switched to the GOP, which now more closely reflected their beliefs. Commentators have also attributed the shift to Republican political consultant Karl Rove, who managed numerous political campaigns in Texas in the 1980s and 1990s. Other stated reasons included court-ordered redistricting and the demographic shift in relation to the Sun Belt that favored the Republican Party and conservatism.|$|E
50|$|Evans {{served as}} General Counsel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Georgia <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> for eight years, {{beginning}} with his appointment by then GOP Chairman Ralph Reed in 2001. He was reappointed by Georgia GOP Chairman Alec Poitevint in 2003 and 2005, and by Georgia GOP Chairman Sue Everhart in 2007 and 2009. From 2009-2011, Evans served as Finance Chair <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Georgia <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|R

5|$|Two calamities in {{the autumn}} of 1906 shocked African Americans, and they contributed to {{strengthening}} support for Du Bois's struggle for civil rights to prevail over Booker T. Washington's accommodationism. First, President Teddy Roosevelt dishonorably discharged 167 black soldiers because they were accused of crimes {{as a result of the}} Brownsville Affair. Many of the discharged soldiers had served for 20 years and were near retirement. Second, in September, riots broke out in Atlanta, precipitated by unfounded allegations of black men assaulting white women. This was a catalyst for racial tensions based on a job shortage and employers playing black workers against white workers. Ten thousand whites rampaged through Atlanta, beating every black person they could find, resulting in over 25 deaths. In the aftermath of the 1906 violence, Du Bois urged blacks to withdraw their support from the Republican Party, because Republicans Roosevelt and William Howard Taft did not sufficiently support blacks. Most African Americans had been loyal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> since the time of Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, Patton {{was elected}} Governor over Republican Larry Forgy. The major {{achievement}} {{of his first}} term was overhauling higher education, including making the state's community colleges and technical schools independent of the University of Kentucky and organizing them into the Kentucky Community and Technical College System. Shortly after Patton turned back a weak challenge to his re-election in 1999, two Democratic state senators defected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> giving Republicans a majority in that legislative house {{for the first time}} ever. The economic prosperity that fueled Patton's first term success faded into a recession in the early 2000s. Faced with a hostile legislature and a dire economic forecast, Patton was unable to enact much significant legislation in his second term, and his situation was exacerbated in 2002 when news of an extramarital affair and allegations of a sex-for-favors scandal broke. After initially denying the affair, Patton later admitted to it, but continued to deny using his office to benefit his mistress. Later in his term, Patton was attacked for pardoning four of his political advisers who were indicted for violating Kentucky's campaign finance laws and for allegedly abusing his patronage powers. These successive scandals derailed any further political aspirations.|$|E
