5|$|As part of baseball's {{expansion}} in the early 1960s, a franchise was awarded to New York, {{to play in the}} National League beginning in 1962, and {{to be known as the}} New York Mets. It was hoped that the new team would be supported by the many former Giant and Dodger fans left without a team when the franchises moved to California after the 1957 season. There were rumors through the 1961 season that Stengel would be the manager, but he initially showed no interest in managing a team that, given the rules for the expansion draft, was unlikely to be competitive. George Weiss had been forced out as Yankee general manager and hired by the Mets. He wanted Stengel as manager, and after talks with the Mets principal owners, Joan Whitney Payson and M. Donald Grant, Stengel was introduced as Mets manager at a press conference on October 2, 1961. Leonard Koppett of The New York Times suggested that Stengel took the job <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>something</b> back to the game that had been his life for half a century.|$|E

25|$|Gilbert, {{with the}} strong {{influence}} {{of his mother and}} family, felt that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>something</b> back to the community, so he started his foundation which helps inner-city kids, and many other causes such as Breast Cancer and Make A Wish.

25|$|Moreton, however, is not unconcerned of the {{situation}} of the decent poor people and vagrants, so he suggests that barracks or barns should be built at convenient ends of the town, where all vagrants should be obliged to render themselves at a stated hour, where they should have clean straw allowed them, and be kept orderly and out of harm's way; they may be let loose if they have apparent means of honest livelihood, otherwise they should be sent to the workhouse of their respective parish, or to a general workhouse, of which there is great need; and of which more hereafter. This proposition can be valued as an hint of the eighteenth-century ambivalent frame of mind towards these individuals. On one hand restrictions and penalties were vigorously demanded by the English society. On the other hand, not only some kinds of begging activities were allowed but, common people strongly felt a social and religious obligation <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>something</b> or to answer a plea.|$|E
500|$|The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum was {{dedicated}} on 20 October 1979. Critics generally liked the finished building, but the architect himself was unsatisfied.

500|$|... "Virus Alert" [...] is a style {{parody of}} Sparks, {{specifically}} {{their work in}} the mid-1970s, such as their album Kimono My House (1974). It details [...] "the evil that lurks in your email inbox." [...] "Close but No Cigar" [...] is a style parody of Cake that {{tells the story of}} a man who breaks up with his seemingly perfect girlfriends due to the most inconsequential of flaws. The song was inspired by an actual friend of Yankovic's who was never satisfied with any of his dates; Yankovic later explained that [...] "the song was inspired by [...] attitude, that nothing could ever be good enough." [...] The final original recorded, [...] "Pancreas", is a song mainly about the biological functions of the aforementioned organ. The song is an imitation of the musical stylings of Brian Wilson, specifically his work found on the 1966 album Pet Sounds, released by the Beach Boys, and their aborted follow-up album, Smile. Yankovic joked that the reason the song was written was because [...] "my pancreas has given so much to me over the years, I felt like I needed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>something</b> back to it".|$|E
