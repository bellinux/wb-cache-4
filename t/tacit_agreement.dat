30|$|The {{current study}} {{demonstrated}} {{the potential benefits}} of qualitative research focused on discourse repertoires to explore subjective meanings and values of gamblers. The emphasis on cultural values and <b>tacit</b> <b>agreements</b> share common approaches to cultural enquiries on gambling. Beyond examining specific meanings associated with gambling, an important aim was to establish discourse analysis as a possible theoretical framework for studying gambling and in doing so, allowing researchers to look beyond the quantifying extent of young adult gambling to an in-depth understanding of how gambling is understood among young adult gamblers. While further study is needed to establish the relationships between discourse and gambling practices, this case study underscores the need for both researchers and policymakers to consider how discourse shapes experiences among young adults.|$|R
25|$|Soon {{after the}} {{construction}} of the Berlin Wall, a standoff occurred between U.S. and Soviet tanks on either side of Checkpoint Charlie. It began on 22 October as a dispute over whether East German guards were authorized to examine the travel documents of a U.S. diplomat named Allan Lightner passing through to East Berlin to see the opera. By October 27, 10 Soviet and an equal number of American tanks stood 100 yards apart {{on either side of the}} checkpoint. The standoff ended peacefully on October 28 following a U.S.-Soviet understanding to withdraw tanks. Discussions between U.S. Attorney General Robert F.

25|$|Littleton was {{returned}} unopposed, along with Sir John Wrottesley, 8th Baronet, as MP for Staffordshire on 8 April 1784. The seat was dominated {{at this time}} by the Leveson-Gower family of Trentham Hall. They were traditionally Whigs but Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford had accepted posts in Tory ministries. By general agreement among the county landed gentry, one candidate should represent the Leveson Gower interest: this was Wrottesley, who {{had served in the}} American Revolutionary War, but returned home to oppose the running of it – essentially Gower's own position. The second seat was for a country member: a gentlemen acceptable to the local landowning interest but essentially uncommitted to party. This was Littleton. In fact, the Earl of Uxbridge had designs on the seat forhis son, Lord Paget, who was still only 16 years old. By proposing Littleton, now in his late 50s, he hoped the seat might become vacant at the next election. In reality, Littleton survived for a further 28 years, holding his seat until his death. Wrottesley, however, died in 1787 and was replaced by Lord Gower, the Marquess's son. Gower was to remain an MP for Staffordshire until 1799, when his half-brother Lord Granville Leveson-Gower took over, holding the seat until 1815. Thus Littleton's colleagues at Westminster were much grander than himself for most of his political career, and in his last years he was largely overawed by them. Because of the <b>tacit</b> <b>agreement</b> about the distribution of seats, all Littleton's elections were uncontested.|$|E

Public debates on agricultural biotechnology or biomedicine differed in the dominant aspect they addressed, respectively. This article specifies such aspects as discursive frames being <b>tacit</b> <b>agreements</b> over what is relevant and which arguments count. It investigates the role of frames in past debates and the relation between frames and issues relevant for technology governance such as policy advice, public participation and the political legitimation of decisions.

40|$|Public service bargains (PSBs) define rewards, {{competencies}} and loyalties for civil servants. They involve both explicit and <b>tacit</b> <b>agreements</b> with politicians. The article {{suggests that these}} two kinds of bargain may not be closely coordinated with one another, and can become “loosely coupled”, operating and evolving with relative independence. This is particularly likely when there is conflict between rational-actor preferences and institutional expectations about political-administrative behavior. Such a trade-off can be managed by “decoupling” the explicit and tacit PSB, so that they operate differently in public and in private. Loose coupling results in inconsistent PSBs that are resistant to change, whereas decoupling highlights the compliance costs that actors face when securing cultural legitimacy for their bargains. These arguments are illustrated by the long-term development of ‘Next Steps’ agencies in the U. K., where a marked disjuncture has emerged between the stated and practiced PSB...|$|R
40|$|Gasoline {{retail prices}} are {{generally}} easily observable on an everyday basis, and high price volatility raises public concern. There {{seems to be}} widespread opinion that higher gasoline prices {{are the result of}} firm collusion aimed at restricting local competition. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to test the nature of competition concerning price setting in the Norwegian retail gasoline market. By using data on daily retail gasoline prices collected during spring 2005 in two Bergen areas, Sandviken and Askøy, we attempt to define if the competition climate can be described as competitive, imperfectly competitive or tacitly collusive. An econometric method used is based on the distinction of the effects of local market competition, input prices and common strategies of oil companies on trends in daily retail prices. We can not reject the hypothesis that retail gasoline stations enter <b>tacit</b> <b>agreements,</b> and we find that the observed behavior is inconsistent with the competitive model or with the non-collusive imperfect competition model...|$|R
500|$|The truces {{were not}} unique to the Christmas period, and {{reflected}} a growing mood of [...] "live and let live", where infantry close together would stop overtly aggressive behavior and often engage in small-scale fraternisation, engaging in conversation or bartering for cigarettes.

The Christmas truces were particularly significant due to the number of men involved and the level of their participation—even in very peaceful sectors, dozens of men openly congregating in daylight was remarkable—and are often seen as a symbolic moment of peace and humanity amidst one of the most violent events of human history.|$|E
500|$|Initial {{attempts}} to seek powers {{to make the}} River Don navigable were hampered by opposition from local landowners and disunity between the authorities in Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster. The first Act of Parliament was presented in 1698 by the MP for Thirsk, Sir Godfrey Copley of Sprotborough, representing the interests of Rotherham. Although there was support from the [...] "gentlemen, traders and inhabitants" [...] of Doncaster, the Corporation opposed the Bill {{in view of the}} likely impact on their mills. There was no support from Sheffield either, and the Bill failed at its first reading. In 1704 Doncaster Corporation, with the support of its traders, presented a Bill that received a first reading, but disappeared without a second reading ever happening. By 1722 there was some agreement between Sheffield and Doncaster, with a <b>tacit</b> <b>agreement</b> that Doncaster would be responsible for the river below their town, and Sheffield for the section above Doncaster. There was organised resistance to the scheme from local landowners, and it appears that their influence resulted in the proposed Bill being defeated in committee, so it could not be presented to parliament.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe right {{framework}} for studying normative issues in infosociety and MAS {{is that of}} deliberate or spontaneous social order, and intended or unintended, centralised or decentralised forms of social control. For effectively supporting human cooperation {{it is necessary to}} “incorporate” social and normative knowledge in intelligent technology; computers should deal with—and thus partially “understand”—permissions, obligations, power, roles, commitments, trust, etc. Here only one facet of this problem is considered: the spontaneous and decentralised norm creation, and normative monitoring and intervention. Cognitive aspects of spontaneous conventions, implicit commitments, <b>tacit</b> <b>agreements,</b> and the bottom-up issuing and spreading of norms are discussed. The transition from “face to face” normative relationships to some stronger constraints on agents' action, and to institutions and authority, and the possibility of a consequent increase of trust, are explored. In particular, I focus on the transition from two party trust, right, permission, and commitment, to three party relationships, where some witness or some enforcing authority is introduced. In this perspective of ‘formalising the informal’, i. e., the interpersonal unofficial normative matter, I discuss (also in order to stress dangers of computer-based formalisation and enforcement of rules) the important phenomenon of functional (collaborative) systematic violation of rules in organisation and cooperation, and the possible emergence of a “convention to violate”...|$|R
40|$|Humans are {{especially}} good at taking another’s perspective — representing what others might be thinking or experiencing. This “mentalizing” capacity {{is apparent in}} everyday human interactions and conversations. We investigated its neural basis using magnetoencephalography. We focused on whether mentalizing was engaged spontaneously and routinely to understand an utterance’s meaning or largely on-demand, to restore "common ground" when expectations were violated. Participants conversed with 1 of 2 confederate speakers and established <b>tacit</b> <b>agreements</b> about objects’ names. In a subsequent “test” phase, some of these agreements were violated by either the same or a different speaker. Our analysis of the neural processing of test phase utterances revealed recruitment of neural circuits associated with language (temporal cortex), episodic memory (e. g., medial temporal lobe), and mentalizing (temporo-parietal junction and ventro-medial prefrontal cortex). Theta oscillations (3 - 7 Hz) were modulated most prominently, and we observed phase coupling between functionally distinct neural circuits. The episodic memory and language circuits were recruited in anticipation of upcoming referring expressions, suggesting that context-sensitive predictions were spontaneously generated. In contrast, the mentalizing areas were recruited on-demand, {{as a means for}} detecting and resolving perceived pragmatic anomalies, with little evidence they were activated to make partner-specific predictions about upcoming linguistic utterances...|$|R

40|$|It is {{not easy}} to {{rationalize}} how peer review, as the current grassroots of science, can work based on voluntary contributions of reviewers. There is no rationale to write impartial and thorough evaluations. Consequently, there is no risk in submitting low-quality work by authors. As a result, scientists face a social dilemma: if everyone acts according to his or her own self-interest, low scientific quality is produced. Still, in practice, reviewers as well as authors invest high effort in reviews and submissions. We examine how the increased relevance of public good benefits (journal impact factor), the editorial policy of handling incoming reviews, and the acceptance decisions that take into account reputational information can help the evolution of high-quality contributions from authors. High effort from the side of reviewers is problematic even if authors cooperate: reviewers are still best off by producing low-quality reviews, which does not hinder scientific development, just adds random noise and unnecessary costs to it. We show with agent-based simulations that <b>tacit</b> <b>agreements</b> between authors that are based on reciprocity might decrease these costs, but does not result in superior scientific quality. Our study underlines why certain self-emerged current practices, such as the increased importance of journal metrics, the reputation-based selection of reviewers, and the reputation bias in acceptance work efficiently for scientific development. Our results find no answers, however, how the system of peer review with impartial and thorough evaluations could be sustainable jointly with rapid scientific development.
