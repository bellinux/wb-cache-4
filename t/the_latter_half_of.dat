5|$|According to {{the hearth}} tax returns of 1664, the {{township}} of Sale had {{a population of}} about 365. Parish registers show that the area experienced steady population growth during the 17th and 18th centuries, more so during <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the 19th century (due to the Industrial Revolution). This later growth was less rapid than that seen in neighbouring areas such as Altrincham, Bowdon or Stretford. The increase in growth in <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the 19th century also coincides {{with the arrival of the}} railway, indicative of Sale's growth as a commuter town. A huge increase in population in 1921–1931 is accounted for by the administrative merger of Sale with Ashton upon Mersey in 1930. Steady growth thereon is evident until 1981, when the decline of industry in Trafford and the Greater Manchester area accounts for a reduction in the town's population. This follows the general population trend for Greater Manchester, with residents relocating to new jobs. The table below details population changes since 1801, including the percentage change since the last census.|$|E

5000|$|During <b>the</b> chaotic <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{first century}} BC, marked by civil wars and the {{dictatorship}} of Gaius Julius Caesar, Cicero championed {{a return to}} the traditional republican government. However, his career as a statesman was marked by inconsistencies and a tendency to shift his position in response to changes in the political climate. His indecision may be attributed to his sensitive and impressionable personality; he was prone to overreaction in the face of political and private change. [...] "Would that {{he had been able to}} endure prosperity with greater self-control and adversity with more fortitude!" [...] wrote C.

Japanese poet and critic Masaoka Shiki revived the term tanka {{in the early twentieth}} century for his statement that waka should be renewed and modernized. Haiku is also a term of his invention, used for his revision of standalone hokku, with the same idea.|$|R
