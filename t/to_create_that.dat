In September 1963 a bomb exploded in a church in Birmingham, Alabama, killing four young girls. This prompted Waddell <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>That</b> Which Might Have Been: Birmingham 1963, a work that was set up at the First Unitarian Universalist Church in Phoenix in 1969. A second casting was later installed at the Carver Museum and Cultural Center in Phoenix.|$|E
25|$|Since it {{presumed that}} Congress's {{failure to act}} in the years since Federal Baseball Club was an {{implicit}} expression of intent to keep baseball exempt from the Sherman Antitrust Act, it has been read as having done more <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>that</b> exemption than the older case. Two justices (Stanley Forman Reed and Harold Hitz Burton) dissented from the short, unsigned per curiam majority opinion, arguing MLB and its revenue sources had changed enough since 1922 that the logic of that case no longer applied. In 1972, a third justice (William O. Douglas) would express his regret at having joined the majority when Toolson was again upheld in the similar Flood v. Kuhn.|$|E

It showed the story of three working women facing troubles everyday, {{both inside and outside}} their houses and how they overcome them. Dealing with issues like eve teasing and public molestation, the video got four lakh hits in two days. Speaking about the purpose of the project, Kashyap showed his intention to make people feel angry: [...] "..the idea was not to offer a solution, just show something <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>that</b> feeling".|$|E

500|$|Filming took {{around six}} weeks, {{relatively}} short for a thriller; Weisz said most take {{about three months}} to complete. Producers used hand-held cameras and had a lower budget than usual for the genre. Kondracki said filming in Eastern Europe was crucial, [...] "In a story such as this, it's more about what you don't see, so you need <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>that</b> world." [...] The Carpathian Mountains in Romania served as the backdrop for the war-ravaged Sarajevo of the late 1990s. Scenes set in UN buildings were filmed in Toronto. Most outdoor scenes are set at night; daytime shots often appear bleak, gray and overcast. This, coupled with a grainy texture, helped create a documentary feel.|$|E
500|$|For {{the closing}} reveal {{involving}} Melisandre, {{the director of}} the episode stated that a similar technique to the body double of Cersei Lannister in [...] "Mother's Mercy" [...] was used, with Carice van Houten wearing prosthetic makeup for the face that was then transposed onto the real body of an old woman. Podeswa stated, [...] "The idea is there's an indefinite indeterminate quality that she could be ancient. We were limited by choosing to use a real person rather than a complete [...] creation. Because what does a 400-year-old person look like? We don't know. So if you try <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>that,</b> then you're creating something that looks beyond our known reality. Here you feel like she's very old without putting a number on it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Jacksonville" [...] premiered to {{generally}} positive reviews. James Poniewozik of Time Magazine {{called it}} [...] "fine" [...] and [...] "well-acted", especially liking John Noble's performance. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A-, explaining [...] "I liked 'Jacksonville' {{for the way}} it plunged directly {{into the heart of}} the show's mythology for the first time in a while, and even if it didn't tell us much we didn't already know, having the story become more personal for our heroes served <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>that</b> unsettled feeling at which Fringe excels". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly loved [...] "Jacksonville", believing it to be a [...] "tremendously moving, startling episode" [...] and [...] "one of [...] finest hours". AOL TV writer Jane Boursaw particularly praised the scene of Olivia trying to comfort her younger self, and then confronting Walter over it. She also felt Olivia's loss of memory to be [...] "interesting," [...] and became [...] "practically gleeful" [...] at her and Peter's near kiss.|$|E

500|$|The Avalanches have {{described}} the album as a [...] "road trip" [...] in a [...] "big, wide, expansive country like Australia." [...] For inspiration, the group looked back on their teenage years of driving {{around the country and}} suburbia listening to music. The record is supposed to [...] "capture that feeling of growing up...jumping in the car and hitting the road with a six-pack and heading out to the bush." [...] The album attempts to capture the [...] "halfway between happy and sad" [...] feeling similar to old Beach Boys records which are a constant inspiration for the group. Chater felt that this feeling is what made Since I Left You a success, and they have continuously strived <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>that</b> feeling. Di Blasi thinks of Wildflower as a free-spirited person who does what they wish regardless of conventionality. The album features many samples from 1960s psychedelic music and relates to the era through counterculture and anti-establishment themes.|$|E
500|$|The final scene, {{featuring}} Burt's face superimposed {{onto the}} cityscape, {{was created by}} special effects supervisor Mat Beck. The only actual footage in the scene is a pull-back shot of the carnival that was filmed 110 {{feet in the air}} via crane. A CGI cityscape was then created that resembled Burt Reynolds' head. The two shots were sewn together, and a blur effect was added to [...] " [...] it sell". An alternate version of the scene was created that featured Chris Carter's head instead of Reynolds'. This version was included as a bonus feature on the season nine DVD set. The score for the episode, {{like the rest of the}} series, was composed by Mark Snow. Snow based much of the music in the episode on records made by Karl Zéro, on the request of Carter. Carter later noted that [...] "I had heard his music and it was so far out and it fit with exactly what I wanted to do because I wanted to recreate [...] Little Italy. [...] I wanted <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>that</b> festival." ...|$|E
500|$|The abuse {{he faced}} {{at the hands}} of opponents early in his NHL career {{prompted}} Iginla's coaches to work at developing his physical play. While he was not enthusiastic about fighting, Iginla accepted then head coach Brian Sutter's arguments that he needed to adopt a more aggressive style to improve as a player. Iginla is most effective when he has room to manoeuvre, and <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>that</b> space, he had to intimidate his opponents. The lessons Iginla learned have carried throughout his career. [...] "You've got a power forward who does it all," [...] said Craig Conroy. [...] "I mean, he'll fight, and hit, and score goals. Maybe it's not the end-to-end rushes, but he does all those little things that win games and get things done." [...] His opponents also respect his play. Rob Blake said that while Iginla is not known for fancy play, [...] "he'll run you over. Or he'll fight somebody. And then he'll score a goal. He does pretty much everything you'd want a guy to do." ...|$|E

500|$|Loyalty to Loyaltys title {{comes from}} a paper {{of the same name}} by American philosopher Josiah Royce, in which he {{challenged}} Friedrich Nietzsche's ideas about [...] "will to power" [...] and the übermensch, [...] "saying that the ultimate pursuit of mankind should be to live in community and embrace each other, not to try to trample each other and rise to the top." [...] Maust said that he could relate to that phrase with the band saying that it's [...] "very similar to how [...] conduct ourselves, the way that [...] write songs and the way that [...] view each other in the band. No one person is writing for the other person, but we are loyal to each other. We're loyal to loyalty." [...] For the recording process, Maust explained that they took four months to experiment with deeper and grittier sounds they were comfortable with, compared to the first record that took eight days <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>that</b> carried [...] "a much more polished, for-radio sound." [...] He also commented that the overall dark tone throughout the album was the cause of constant touring across Europe, but said that it did more good than harm for the band because it led to them crafting songs that weren't written from the perspective of being on the road.|$|E

As Berlin searched for funding <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>that</b> content, a mutual friend put him in touch with Ken Alexander, a former high school English and history teacher and then senior producer of CBC Newsworld's CounterSpin. Like Berlin, Alexander was hoping to found an intelligent Canadian magazine that dealt with world affairs.|$|E

2500|$|<b>To</b> <b>create</b> <b>that</b> setting, Morrison {{employed}} the architect John Buonarotti Papworth. At Basildon, Papworth combined {{the roles of}} architect and interior decorator, helping to create what Morrison described as [...] "a casket for my pictorial gems." [...] Many of Papworth's more ambitious plans were not realised; the demolition and replacement by colonnades of the yards, the conversion of a courtyard into a sculpture gallery, {{and the creation of}} a carriage ramp to the piano nobile on the East front were all declined by Morrison. However, the house was fitted up with a hot water system and fire precautions, and the decoration of the principal reception rooms was completed in suitably classical styles.|$|E

Although he did not feel any sort of relationship with the character, he was enchanted by the dialogue structure, the way the writers [...] "brilliantly use those words that most of us don't recognize <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>that</b> rhythm.

2500|$|The source {{material}} for the two seasons of Nero Wolfe was written between 1939 (Over My Dead Body) and 1966 (Death of a Doxy), with most stories written in the 1950s. Jaffe said he chose {{to stick with the}} era for the adaptations [...] "because I thought there was so much style that people could identify with and that we could play off. Ultimately, {{the most important thing is}} that the audience remain removed from the show by three or four decades. You can't do what Paramount did and update it and make the language modern. The whole thing doesn't make sense, because the tonal idiom doesn't play in the modern world.

2500|$|The word polyamorous first {{appeared}} in an article by Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart, [...] "A Bouquet of Lovers", published in May 1990 in Green Egg Magazine, as [...] "poly-amorous".

The words [...] "polyamory, -ous, and -ist" [...] {{were added to the}} OED in 2006. In 1999, Zell-Ravenheart was asked by the editor of the OED to provide a definition of the term, and had provided it as The practice, state or ability of having more than one sexual loving relationship at the same time, with the full knowledge and consent of all partners involved. Polyamory is a less specific term than polygamy, the practice or condition of having more than one spouse.|$|E
2500|$|On May 8, 2008, eBay {{announced}} {{the opening of}} its newest building on the company's North Campus in San Jose, {{which is the first}} structure in the city to be built from the ground up to LEED Gold standards.
