5|$|DJ Hero 2 {{was officially}} {{announced}} in June 2010 for release {{in the last}} quarter of 2010. Prior to the game's announcement, Activision revealed a month before the game's release that it is actively seeking artists for downloadable content and a sequel to the game. David Guetta has stated that he was set to work on the game's sequel, <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>late</b> in 2010. Activision CEO Bobby Kotick stated that despite low sales of DJ Hero, they are committed to continuing the series, with the sequel due in 2010. The sequel, DJ Hero 2, was further confirmed during an Activision investors report for 2009, citing it as one of only 2 major Guitar Hero titles to be expected from Activision in 2010, with an expected late-2010 release date.|$|E
5|$|After Watkin's {{retirement}} from management, {{relations between the}} MR and GCR deteriorated rapidly over shared use of Baker Street station and the congested route into London, and soon broke down completely. On 30 July 1898 John Bell, General Manager of the Metropolitan Railway, {{took control of the}} Quainton Road signal box himself and refused to allow a GCR train onto MR-owned tracks {{on the grounds that it}} was scheduled to take the Great Western rather than the Metropolitan route south of Aylesbury, while on one occasion in 1901 King Edward VII was travelling home after visiting a friend in Wendover; the MR signalman allowed a slow goods train to run in front of the royal train, causing the King <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>late</b> back in London. The MR management also refused the GCR permission to install points to connect their engine shed at Aylesbury to the railway line, on the grounds that the land for the shed had been bought clandestinely. Eventually a parallel set of tracks was built for the GCR between Harrow and London, running alongside the MR to a separate terminus at Marylebone, a short distance from Baker Street. The GCR continued to share the less-congested section between Quainton Road and Harrow—including Chalfont Road station—with the MR.|$|E
25|$|Queensland Rail {{implemented}} electrification relatively {{recently and}} utilises {{the more recent}} 25 kV AC technology with around 1,000km of the narrow gauge network now electrified. It operates a fleet of electric locomotives to transport coal for export, the most recent of which the 3,000kW (4,020 HP) 3300/3400 Class. Queensland Rail is currently rebuilding its 3100 and 3200 class locos into the 3700 class, which use AC traction and need only three locomotives on a coal train rather than five. Queensland Rail is getting 30 3800 class locomotives from Siemens in Munich, Germany, which will arrive during late 2008 to 2009. QRNational (Queensland Rail's coal and freight after separation) has increased the order of 3800 class locomotives. They continue <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>late</b> into 2010.|$|E

60|$|Before us ran the {{turbulent}} river, vexed with plunging shells and obscured in spots by blue sheets of low-lying smoke. The two little steamers were doing their duty well. They {{came over to}} us empty and went back crowded, sitting very low in the water, apparently {{on the point of}} capsizing. The farther edge of the water could not be seen; the boats came out of the obscurity, took on their passengers and vanished in the darkness. But on the heights above, the battle was burning brightly enough; a thousand lights kindled and expired in every second of time. There were broad flushings in the sky, against which the branches of the trees showed black. Sudden flames burst out here and there, singly and in dozens. Fleeting streaks of fire crossed over to us by way of welcome. These expired in blinding flashes and fierce little rolls of smoke, attended with the peculiar metallic ring of bursting shells, and followed by the musical humming of the fragments as they struck into the ground on every side, making us wince, but doing little harm. The air was full of noises. To {{the right and the left}} the musketry rattled smartly and petulantly; directly in front it sighed and growled. To the experienced ear this meant that the death-line was an arc of which the river was the chord. There were deep, shaking explosions and smart shocks; the whisper of stray bullets and the hurtle of conical shells; the rush of round shot. There were faint, desultory cheers, such as announce a momentary or partial triumph. Occasionally, against the glare behind the trees, could be seen moving black figures, singularly distinct but apparently no longer than a thumb. They seemed to me ludicrously like the figures of demons in old allegorical prints of hell. To destroy these and all their belongings the enemy needed but another hour of daylight; the steamers in that case would have been doing him fine service by bringing more fish to his net. Those of us who had the good fortune <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>late</b> could then have eaten our teeth in impotent rage. Nay, to make his victory sure it did not need that the sun should pause in the heavens; one of the many random shots falling into the river would have done the business had chance directed it into the engine-room of a steamer. You can perhaps fancy the anxiety with which we watched them leaping down.|$|E

50|$|Sunderland {{is unique}} in the United Kingdom as being the only {{community}} {{to be on the}} mainland and yet dependent upon tidal access.

5000|$|French poet Guy Allix {{said about}} Barron's poetry: [...] " [...] To born is <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>late</b> already [...] ", Néstor says {{to us in}} a desperation taken with courage of fully assumed man. There is in this poetry {{something}} radical and rough that, beyond the distresses of an epoch, plunges in our more secret and more terrible depths and seems to find there, paradoxically, an antidote against the pain of living, an indomitable energy. This shows a way without complacency, a way of real bravery in these times of widespread resignation.|$|E
50|$|The Supreme Court {{reversed}} the Third Circuit, ruling 7-1 that the postal exception under the FTCA {{did not include}} all negligence {{that occurred in the}} course of mail delivery. Instead, context and precedent required the exception to be limited to negligence that caused mail to be lost or <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>late,</b> in damaged condition, or at the wrong address. Dolan's suit was accordingly not covered by the exception and could proceed. The majority opinion was delivered by Justice Anthony Kennedy. Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissent, arguing that the majority ignored the plain language of the statute.|$|E

However, on 17 May 2011 when the programme was re-scheduled to an earlier slot of 11:30 Neil himself was caught in traffic and missed the entire programme, which had to be introduced solo by Anita Anand with an empty chair alongside her.

50|$|Changing {{prescriptions}} for appropriate theater behavior found in conduct books reflect such a shift. Where {{it was once}} fashionable <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>late</b> and not pay {{too much attention to}} the performances, the new culture of politeness emphasized the importance of silence and attentiveness. Hall-Witt argues that the shift in elite behavior in theatres was prompted by changes to the theater's subscription to the loges, which meant that box seats would be available to non-elites. As a result, the social hierarchy that was mirrored in the seating arrangements of the theater were blurred. By adhering to a new etiquette of politeness that valued silence and attentiveness, elites could replace old methods of differentiation based on seating, with 'superior' behavior.|$|E

When a mugging occurs, John and Charlie chase the mugger into a subway tunnel, and all trains traveling {{in their direction}} are halted.

John and Charlie avoid getting hit by the train; however, when transit police at the next station witness the mugger running toward the money train, they shoot him dead. The mugger is revealed to be a young teenage boy, which triggers a brawl between John, Charlie, and the other transit officers. Patterson blames the two for causing his money train <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>late.</b>|$|E
