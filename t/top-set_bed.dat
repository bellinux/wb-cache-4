40|$|Reservoir {{sedimentation}} generally takes {{a form of}} delta {{which is}} composed from fourparts, namely top-set, fore-set, bottom-set and density-current bed. To estimate the formof delta deposition is very important and an analytical estimation for it has been developedonly for bed load transportation which corresponds to the case without bottom-set bed. Itis not clear how {{the existence of the}} bottom-set bed affects on the river-bed variation oftop-set bed obtained by the above estimation. This may be a difficult poin in applyingthe above estimation to actual problems. In this paper, author treated the above problem and developed an analytical methodto estimate the river bed variation due to the sediment deposition in both case with andwithout bottom-set bed. And also, it is made clear that the bottom-set bed has little effecton the river bed variation of upstream part of <b>top-set</b> <b>bed</b> and the analysis without bottom-set bed is useful for practical problems...|$|E
