5|$|Although Monroe {{had become}} one of 20th Century-Fox's biggest stars, her {{contract}} had not changed since 1950, meaning that she was paid far less than other stars of her stature and could not choose her projects or co-workers. She was also tired of being typecast, and her attempts to appear in films other than comedies or musicals had been thwarted by Zanuck, who had a strong personal dislike of her and did not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> earn the studio as much revenue in dramas. When she refused to begin shooting yet another musical comedy, a film version of The Girl in Pink Tights, which was to co-star Frank Sinatra, the studio suspended her on January 4, 1954.|$|E
5|$|Bonfire (March 21, 1983 – October 28, 2013), {{full name}} Gestion Bonfire, was an Oldenburg gelding that competed in {{dressage}} with Dutch rider Anky van Grunsven. Between 1991 and 2000, the pair competed in multiple {{national and international}} championships, including three Olympic Games and two World Equestrian Games. They won one gold medal and four silver medals at the Olympics and one gold and three silvers at the World Equestrian Games. Although known for having a hot temperament, Bonfire mellowed as he aged, becoming one of Van Grunsven's best horses – until she found his replacement, Salinero, she did not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> ever find a horse to match Bonfire's talent. A statue of Bonfire stands in Van Grunsven's home town of Erp.|$|E
25|$|The {{competition}} {{to win the}} part of Mammy in Gone with the Wind was almost as fierce as that for Scarlett O'Hara. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt wrote to film producer David O. Selznick to ask that her own maid, Elizabeth McDuffie, be given the part. McDaniel did not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be chosen because she had earned her reputation as a comic actress. One source claimed that Clark Gable recommended that the role be given to McDaniel; in any case, {{she went to her}} audition dressed in an authentic maid's uniform and won the part.|$|E

Veteran actress Jennifer Jason Leigh was {{originally}} approached {{to play the}} character, but Watros ended up playing the role instead. During her audition, Watros did not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be cast.

500|$|Following Karl's {{affair with}} Sarah, Susan {{goes out to}} dinner with Martin Chester (Gil Tucker), a former boyfriend and member of Karl's {{university}} band. Woodburne told Annette Dasey of Inside Soap that Karl knows Martin is taking Susan to dinner and he does not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be capable of any [...] "misconduct" [...] with him. The actress explained [...] "Susan is very attracted to Martin, but she wouldn't be aware of it if her marriage was more solid and she wasn't feeling so unloved." [...] Woodburne stated that Susan is tempted to have a fling, but she ultimately decides that she wants to save her marriage. Despite Karl's affair, she still loves him and they need to work through their problems. Woodburne was good friends with Tucker as they previously worked together on Cop Shop.|$|E
500|$|The first {{actor to}} be cast was Renee O'Connor as Dr. Jessica Ryan in December 2006; she filmed her first scenes in February 2007. O'Connor had visited her {{personal}} friend and Boogeymans producer Rob Tapert on the New Zealand set, {{where she had}} had a discussion with him about [...] "the differences of having a supernatural demon versus a real person that can come in and be a threat." [...] She concluded the former was scarier. On getting cast in the film and her approach to the character, she stated:I had a contract with Rob Tapert and I just emailed him and said that I really wanted to play this character. I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be interesting because it touches back on some of the things I've played as an actress, and that was it. [...] It was so tight in the dialogue, you just have to play with the relationships and find other things going on with the characters to make it seem like there's more depth to what's going on, that there's more of a history between them.|$|E

500|$|In early August 2010, Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} that Eric the Actor, from The Howard Stern Show, had been cast {{for a small}} role in the new season's second episode. Deaf actor Russell Harvard portrayed Joe, {{a man who is}} able to survive the box being opened only to be killed by Fauxlivia. Harvard later commented in an interview, [...] "Fringe was so much fun and not even stressful compared to [...] Hamill. It was very fast and rapid. Playing the dead guy was very easy. Working with Anna Torv was so much fun, she is a great, great actress and very sweet. I did not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be that kind of person." [...] He continued, [...] "There was a stunt which {{she did not want to}} do herself, but I told her 'You want to be authentic so I want you to pull me,' so she obliged. It was a great experience and so much fun and I wish I could have stayed on the show for a long time." ...|$|E

She won by [...] lengths with a final time of 1:59.77, against an {{otherwise}} all-male field of nine other horses, including 2014 Breeders' Cup Classic winner Bayern. She won in the third-fastest winning {{time in the history}} of the race, and with the second-largest margin of victory, behind the 2013 win of Game On Dude. Hughes said: [...] "She’s the first horse who has made me feel lucky to be her owner." [...] Mandella quipped, [...] "We didn’t <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> do it quite like that. We thought it was the girls she was picking on." [...] and added later, [...] "I think the boys pissed her off. I think they were telling sexist jokes on the backside." [...] After the race, her [...] connections announced that she would train with the goal of running in the Breeders' Cup Classic. [...] They also suggested that she might race again in 2016 and that upon retirement, Hughes would be likely to keep her at his Spendthrift Farm and not offer her for sale.|$|E
500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1966, Cooney hosted what she called [...] "a little dinner party" [...] at her {{apartment}} near Gramercy Park. [...] In attendance was her husband Tim Cooney, her boss Lewis Freedman, and Lloyd and Mary Morrisett, whom the Cooneys knew socially. [...] Lloyd Morrisett was a mid-level executive at [...] Carnegie Corporation (who later became its CEO), and was then responsible for funding educational research. The conversation turned to the possibilities of using television to educate young children; Morrisett raised the question, [...] "Do you think television {{could be used to}} teach young children?" [...] Cooney replied, [...] "I don't know, but I'd like to talk about it." [...] According to Davis, the party was the start of a five-decade long professional relationship between Cooney and Morrisett. [...] A week later, Cooney and Freedman met with Morrisett at the offices of Carnegie Corporation to discuss doing a feasibility study on creating an educational television program for preschoolers. [...] Freedman was opposed to Cooney's involvement because he did not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be interested in a project that focused on children and because {{he did not want to}} lose her at WNDT, but she was chosen to do the study.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I hate it!' said Lady Merrifield; 'but I suppose I ought! However, there's {{no harm in}} this, that's a comfort; it {{is simply}} that the gentleman that the house is let to has found this note to her somewhere about, and <b>thinks</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> wish to have it.

500|$|Chrissie left Den but was {{eventually}} convinced {{to give their}} marriage another try. Oberman revealed in the Daily Mail that she drew on a famous real-life model to reconcile the dichotomous behaviour of a strong woman taking back her cheating husband: [...] "I based Chrissie on Hillary: an intelligent, attractive woman who was publicly humiliated. People ask why she stays with that awful man. A lot of strong women are like that." [...] She also saw {{the ebb and flow}} of Den and Chrissie's marriage as a reflection of the mental gameplaying that was so prominent in their characterisations: [...] "I think there's a challenge in it, and I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like to be the one who would ultimately tame him." [...] As Den's equal, Chrissie was intended to be a challenge to his propensity for intellectual games, having already outwitted the show's prior , Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Den had seen little threat in his first wife's aptitude, but considered Chrissie to be [...] "as sharp as they come". Indeed, Den's extra-marital dalliances were used by writers to showcase and highlight Chrissie's [...] "strong-willed persona". When Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) chastised Den for caring only about Chrissie's reaction should she learn of their affair, Den fired back: [...] "And so should you. You think I've treated you badly? Well you don't have a clue what's going to happen if she ever finds out! The best thing you can do is keep your mouth shut." [...] By the time Chrissie left the Square, Oberman dryly observed that she had [...] "had more fights on EastEnders than most women have in their whole lives." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hannah Banana" [...] {{was written}} by series regular Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and {{directed}} by John Holmquist, before {{the conclusion of the}} eighth production season. Commenting on the original development of the episode, series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane stated, [...] " [...] was the result of our ongoing desire to let the series stagnate, and kind of evolve things that may have run their course. There's only so many times you can do the Evil Monkey jumping out of that closet, before the joke gets old, and I think often times there's a fear to mess with what works, and change things permanently. [...] We literally retired the Evil Monkey in this episode, and got a great episode out of it, which was worth it, and kind of evolved the series in a way." [...] Singer and actress Candace Marie provided the voice of Miley Cyrus. Marie received the role when her producer alerted her of the audition, and she eventually received a call from the Family Guy casting director a month later. Even though the episode mocked Cyrus, Marie did not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> upset any of Cyrus' fans. She added that she is a fan herself, and [...] "was very impressed by the way Family Guy developed the episode," [...] and thought it was [...] "a huge compliment for them to refer to Miley as the [...] "perfect popstar."" [...] After voicing Cyrus, Marie was called back to Family Guy to voice Meg's friend Beth for [...] "several upcoming episodes." [...] Marie described Beth as a girl that is [...] "rarely addressed in conversation but loves to chime in whenever she can." [...] The song in the episode sung by Cyrus {{was written by}} Chevapravatdumrong, and composed and performed by Family Guy composer Walter Murphy.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2013 {{interview}} {{following the}} announcement that a new trilogy of films would be produced, Fisher confirmed that she would reprise her role as Princess Leia in [...] of the Star Wars series.

[...] After other media outlets reported this on March 6, 2013, her representative said {{the same day that}} Fisher was joking and that nothing was announced.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the ruling}} family of Charn, there was {{knowledge}} of an evil spell, the Deplorable Word, which would destroy all life except {{the one who}} spoke it, {{but they did not}} know the word itself. [...] Although her ancestors had bound themselves and their descendants with oaths never even to seek knowledge of this spell, Jadis had sought it out and learned it, saying she paid [...] "a terrible price" [...] to learn it. [...] Her sister knew she had discovered the Deplorable Word, but did not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> use it. Facing defeat, Jadis spoke the Deplorable Word, which annihilated all living things under the Sun apart from herself.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Bellisario {{said that}} he [...] "kind of [...] what's going on now" [...] {{and that it was}} {{unlikely}} that the relationship would be taken further any time in the immediate future. De Pablo agreed, saying, [...] "I would think if the characters get together, the whole mystery would be done. I {{think it will be a}} lot more fun to play the tension." [...] She elaborated in another interview, [...] "My character has sort of this understated flirtation with Michael's character, Tony. She gets jealous, but I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never admit it or hook up with someone in the workplace. He scares her to death. He is the epitome of the American man and all of the things that come out of his mouth are brutally stupid." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the book, Social Issues in Television, a senior, nameless {{script editor}} opined that the {{abduction}} storyline sought {{to engage the}} audience {{at the expense of}} any parent's realistic concerns: [...] "We get it wrong when we take the easy route like the kidnap snatch with Vicki. My argument about this was that I am a father but have never had my kids snatched. If I'm just sitting at home and my children are out late at night and they say they're going to be back at midnight and they don't come back, you immediately think they're dead and you start to worry. If they'd actually been snatched, it would have affected my entire life forever. I would never have recovered from it. I would have been frightened every time one of them left my side. Therefore the consequence of running a storyline like that is immense. If we were being totally responsible about it the fallout on Michelle would have been, well I just don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have been the same person again." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aguilera was {{nominated}} for two Grammy Awards in 2000: Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for [...] "Genie in a Bottle", with Aguilera winning the first. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard cited her win on the Grammy {{as one of her}} [...] "10 Biggest Career Moments", claiming: [...] "The battle for teen pop supremacy made its way to the Grammy Awards in 2000, when Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera were both nominated for the Best New Artist prize. Both singing stars had issued hit albums in 1999, [...] and Aguilera ended up walking away with one of the night's top prizes. [...] "I'm shaking right now!" [...] Aguilera told the audience at the 2000 ceremony, also admitting that she did not have a speech prepared for the event because she didn't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> win. Aguilera has since taken home four more Grammys, for the songs 'Lady Marmalade,' 'Beautiful,' 'Ain't No Other Man,' and 'Say Something' respectively." [...] Aguilera also received another Grammy nomination in 2001 for [...] "What a Girl Wants" [...] on the [...] "Best Female Pop Vocal Performance" [...] category, and according to Time, [...] "both of which helped catapult the album {{to the top of the}} charts." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2013, it {{was said}} that Ava DuVernay had signed on to direct the film for Pathé UK and Plan B, and that she was {{revising}} the script with the original screenwriter, Paul Webb. DuVernay estimated that she re-wrote 90 percent of Webb's original script. Those revisions included rewriting King's speeches, because, in 2009, King's estate licensed them to DreamWorks and Warner Bros. for an untitled project to be produced by Steven Spielberg. Subsequent negotiations between those companies and Selmas producers did not lead to an agreement. DuVernay drafted alternative speeches that evoke the historic ones without violating the copyright. She recalled spending hours listening to King's words while hiking the canyons of Los Angeles. While she did not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> [...] "get anywhere close to just the beauty and that nuance of his speech patterns", she did identify some of King's basic structure, such as a tendency to speak in triplets (saying one thing in three different ways). In early 2014, Oprah Winfrey came on board as a producer along with Pitt, and by February 25 Paramount Pictures was in final negotiations for the US and Canadian distribution rights. On April 4, 2014, it was announced that Bradford Young would be the director of photography of the film.|$|E
2500|$|From the {{wreckage}} of the museum, a sentinel begins to form. While Wolverine tries to stop the sentinel from maturing, he is thrown into the ocean. Shortly after, Wolverine swims on to Utopia and tells the mutant children that they need to leave. Cyclops tells the students to fight together and that they can beat the sentinel, but Wolverine objects to using children to fight battles. Cyclops doesn't listen and begins to prepare the students for combat. Shortly after Wolverine returns with a detonator to blow up Utopia and orders all remaining people on the island to evacuate. Cyclops and Wolverine's frustration with each other come to a head when Cyclops brings up Jean Grey saying that she never loved Wolverine and always feared him. Wolverine replies [...] "And if she were here right now, who do you <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be more frightened of?" [...] The two fight each other in a rage while being attacked by the sentinel and as Wolverine claws into Cyclops visor, the students reappear on the battlefield to help them fight the sentinel. In the morning, Cyclops and Wolverine stand victorious with the students all living, but Wolverine cannot continue watching Cyclops use children as soldiers to fight these battles. Wolverine announces his departure from Utopia and indicates he will take any mutant on the island who wants to leave with him. While Wolverine does not leave as an enemy of Cyclops and his X-Men, he makes clear he wants both sides {{to stay out of the}} others business.|$|E
