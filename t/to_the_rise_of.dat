5|$|A {{period of}} {{rebellion}} {{at the start}} of the 19th century led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> the progressive Sultan Mahmud II and eventually to the Tanzimat period, which produced political reforms and allowed new technology to be introduced to the city. Bridges across the Golden Horn were constructed during this period, and Istanbul was connected to the rest of the European railway network in the 1880s. Modern facilities, such as a water supply network, electricity, telephones, and trams, were gradually introduced to Istanbul over the following decades, although later than to other European cities. The modernization efforts were not enough to forestall the decline of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the series}} fictionalises {{the world of}} MI5, several storylines are based on truth. The series had advisors who were ex-MI5 officers.

The producers were keen in world events that Britain and America were directly or indirectly responsible for, where the consequences of an operation are worse than what they intended to resolve in the first place, known as blowback. One example includes the two powers aiding the Afghan Mujahideen in 1989 before {{pulling out of the}} country; this ultimately lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> Al-Qaeda.|$|E

In 2014, Obama announced a restoration of full diplomatic relations with Cuba {{for the first time since}} 1961.

His treatment of the unionists was typical of his hard line anti-communist beliefs and as such his relations with left-wing governments were tense. Along with many senior army and ex-army officers, he was a leading member of the clandestine far-right-wing League of National Security. This was reportedly a response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> communism in Australia. Its members stood ready to take up arms to stop a Catholic or communist revolution.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of 19th-century Romanticism, medieval virtues like chivalry became increasingly popular among the elites. Parallel to this, medieval architecture, primarily Gothic style, returned to public attention in Germany with the unfinished Cologne Cathedral, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> Gothic Revival architecture. Other notable examples of this romantic infatuation with medieval structures and architecture are the Votive Cathedral of Vienna and Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria. This nostalgic longing for the medieval past, spurred on by the works of authors such as Hugh Walpole, Sir Walter Scott, and John Ruskin, meant that architectural had once again turned from the Classical to the Gothic style of architecture.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1964, {{however, the}} Kingston Trio's {{dominance}} in record sales and concert bookings began to wane, due partly to imitators in the pop-folk world and also <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> other commercial folk groups like Peter, Paul and Mary. The British Invasion spearheaded by The Beatles, who were signed by EMI/Capitol {{just as the}} Trio's seven-year contract was running out, depressed sales of acoustic folk albums significantly, and Capitol {{did not make a}} serious effort to re-sign the group. Werber secured a generous signing bonus from Decca Records, and the last four albums of the Kingston Trio's first decade were released by that label. Without the production facilities of Capitol, however, and the expertise of Voyle Gilmore and engineer Pete Abbott, the Decca releases lacked the aural brilliance of the Capitol albums, and none of the four sold especially well.|$|E

Pyrrhus returned to Epirus in 275BC after the ultimate failure of both campaigns, which contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> Rome because Greek cities in southern Italy such as Tarentum now became Roman allies.
