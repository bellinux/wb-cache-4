5|$|The {{peppered}} maskray lacks {{economic value}} and is discarded by fisheries. It is often caught incidentally in bottom trawls, {{and due to}} its small size does not benefit from Turtle Exclusion Devices. In particular, this species accounts for approximately 4.5% of the <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> of the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF) in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Over half of the rays caught by the NPF, including almost all the males, are fatally crushed within the trawl. Despite this mortality, the NPF is not believed to have negatively affected the local population because its operational area {{does not include the}} waters where this species is most abundant. The peppered maskray is also caught frequently in scallop trawls operated by the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery. Elsewhere in its range, fishing pressure is relatively light due to external factors such as fuel prices. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, because it remains common and its range includes several Marine Protected Areas.|$|E
25|$|Systems {{that use}} {{individual}} transferable quotas (ITQ), also called individual fishing quota limit the <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> and allocate shares of that quota among the fishers who work that fishery. Fishers can buy/sell/trade shares as they choose.|$|E

40|$|The Turks and Caicos Islands' <b>total</b> marine {{fisheries}} <b>catches</b> {{were estimated}} for 1950 – 2012 using a catch reconstruction approach, estimating all removals, including reported catch destined for export, and unreported domestic artisanal and subsistence <b>catches.</b> <b>Total</b> reconstructed <b>catch</b> {{for the period}} is approximately 2. 8 times that reported by the Turks and Caicos to the FAO, and 86 % higher than the export-adjusted national reported baseline. The pattern of <b>total</b> <b>catches</b> (strong decline to 1970, followed by gradual increase) differs distinctly from that shown by data reported to FAO. Reported landings show a steady increase from less than 1000 t·year− 1 in the 1950 s to around 6000 t·year− 1 in the 2000 s. In contrast, the <b>total</b> reconstructed <b>catches</b> suggest declines in <b>total</b> <b>catches</b> from around 20, 000 t in 1950 {{to a low of}} about 5000 t in 1970, before gradual increases to about 12, 500 t·year− 1 in the late 2000 s. Major discrepancies between reported and reconstructed data are under-reported artisanal catches in the early decades (accounting for 86 % of <b>total</b> <b>catches),</b> and the absence of subsistence catches (14 % of <b>total</b> <b>catches)</b> in reported data. Queen conch (Strombus gigas) and Caribbean spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) dominate reconstructed catches. No discards were estimated as fishing has been highly selective, carried out by hand collection (conch), trap or hook (lobster), or hook and line (finfish). New data published here from local seafood consumption surveys demonstrates that the total local consumption of conch equates to almost the entire <b>total</b> allowable <b>catch,</b> before exported amounts are even factored. Policy-makers in the Turks and Caicos need to act if the sustainability of the fisheries stock and fishing industry is to be ensured...|$|R

In the northwest Atlantic, redfish {{was the most important}} species, with 50% of <b>total</b> <b>catches,</b> while in Spain it was sardine and horse mackerel, with 36%. Off Norway and Svalbard, cod (bacalhau in Portuguese) was the most important species, accounting for 82% of <b>total</b> <b>catches,</b> while from Greenland, redfish was the only species landed.

30|$|Among {{the rest}} of psyllids, a total of 12 Cacopsylla species were collected. Apple-dwelling Cacopsylla mali (Schmidberger) was the most {{abundant}} one (19.5  % of <b>total</b> <b>catches),</b> although it was mainly recorded in one orchard (95.8  % of catches) and it was absent in two. Cacopsylla visci (Curtis) (4.5  %) and Cacopsylla saliceti (Foerster) (4.2  %) followed C. mali in abundance. The two known AP vectors, C. picta and C. melanoneura were detected in all the orchards, although their relative occurrence was low (2.1 and 0.7  % of <b>total</b> <b>catches,</b> respectively). Two Trioza species, T. urticae (L.) (2.6  %) and T. remota Foerster (1.3  %) were also among the psyllid species with more than 25 specimens.|$|R

25|$|The {{spawning}} stock of North-East Arctic cod {{was more than}} a million tons following World War II, but declined to a historic minimum of 118,000 tons in 1987. The North-East Arctic cod catch reached a historic maximum of 1,343,000 tons in 1956, and bottomed out at 212,000 tons in 1990. Since 2000, the {{spawning stock}} has increased quite quickly, helped by low fishing pressure. However, there are worries about a decreased age at first spawning (often an early sign of stock collapse), combined with the level of discards and unreported catches.

25|$|Herring {{are found}} in the North Sea and the North Atlantic at depths to 200 meters. Important herring {{fisheries}} have existed in these areas for centuries. Herring of different sizes and growth rates belong to different populations, each of which have their own migration routes. When spawning, a female produces from 20,000 to 50,000 eggs. After spawning, the herrings are depleted in fat, and migrate back to feeding grounds rich in plankton. Around Iceland, three separate populations of herring were traditionally fished. These stocks collapsed in the late 1960s, although two have since recovered. After the collapse, Iceland turned to capelin, which now account for about half of Iceland's <b>total</b> <b>catch.</b>|$|E
500|$|Fishing remains {{central to}} the islands' economy today, with the <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> being [...] in 2009, valued at over £73.2 million. Mackerel makes up {{more than half of}} the catch in Shetland by weight and value, and there are {{significant}} landings of haddock, cod, herring, whiting, monkfish and shellfish. Farming is mostly concerned with the raising of Shetland sheep, known for their unusually fine wool. Crops raised include oats and barley; however, the cold, windswept islands make for a harsh environment for most plants. Crofting, the farming of small plots of land on a legally restricted tenancy basis, is still practised and is viewed as a key Shetland tradition as well as an important source of income.|$|E
500|$|The very {{different}} geologies of the [...] two archipelagos {{have resulted in}} dissimilar local economies. In Shetland, the main revenue producers in Shetland are agriculture, aquaculture, fishing, renewable energy, the petroleum industry (offshore crude {{oil and natural gas}} production), the creative industries and tourism. Oil and gas was first landed at Sullom Voe in 1978, and it has subsequently become one of the largest oil terminals in Europe. Taxes from the oil have increased public sector spending in Shetland on social welfare, art, sport, environmental measures and financial development. Three quarters of the islands' work force is employed in the service sector and Shetland Islands Council alone accounted for 27.9% of output in 2003.

40|$|There are 300 to 400 {{fish species}} in the marine waters around Korea of which over 100 species are of {{commercial}} value. Korean fisheries yield over 1 million t of marine fish from the waters annually. In general, the increase in fishing activities since the 1970 s has reduced fish populations. UN Food and Agriculture Organization records (FAO, 2000) indicate that <b>total</b> <b>catches</b> of marine fish and invertebrates averaged 1, 565, 973 t from 1980 to 2000. The largest catch of 2, 056, 521 t occurred in 1986 (Fig. 37). Catches were relatively stable from 1987 to about 1996, and have decreased slightly in recent years. Catches in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea were 210, 000 t in the early 1960 s. However, they grew rapidly and have exceeded 1 million t since the mid- 1970 s. <b>Total</b> <b>catches</b> started to decrease after 1986 when they reached around 1. 5 million t.

The species is often not differentiated from [...] golden-lined whiting or trumpeter whiting, meaning fisheries statistics do not reflect the <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> for the species. In 2000, 238 tonnes of whiting were taken in Queensland, a decrease from the past 4 years. The species is primarily taken in estuaries in New South Wales, and is also included under the general heading of 'school whiting' when taken from beaches. Research showed that the average commercial harvest from individual estuaries was around 1-2 tonnes per year, with an increase in most rivers during the 1970s and 80's.|$|E
