5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} claims since WrestleMania III that the quoted attendance figure of 93,173 which established a world record attendance for an indoor event was false and that the real attendance figure was only around 78,000. This is based on claims by Dave Meltzer upon receiving information from the events promoter Zane Bresloff, and that wrestling promoters (including Vince McMahon) were known to regularly inflate attendance figures to make <b>things</b> <b>look</b> better. While the WWE and Silverdome management have always maintained that the 93,173 figure is correct, debate continues among wrestling fans {{as to what the}} true attendance was on the day. Also, Meltzer claimed that the 1992 SummerSlam at Wembley did 79,127, more than WrestleMania III. The record would be decisively broken by WrestleMania 32 in 2016.|$|E
25|$|The early 1990s saw new South African administrators {{begin to}} rebuild the {{international}} facet of South African rugby. During 1992, the South African national side again played {{for the first time}} in years against several combined African representative teams and the following years saw <b>things</b> <b>look</b> more promising for the Africans with their qualification into the 1995 World Cup and more regularity in international fixtures. Their first World Cup saw the South Africans seeded into the toughest group of the competition containing Australia, England and Fiji. The South Africans found their three group matches extremely difficult and failed to win a match during the tournament.|$|E
500|$|Distancing {{the film}} from what {{producer}} Preston Stutzman called the [...] "candy-coated, brightly colored pastel world" [...] of other CG animated films, an {{attempt was made}} to bring an organic look to the film, and dirt was rubbed into the colors. The Nightmare Before Christmas was cited as an inspiration for the filmmakers to try to bend the characters' shapes into extremes, and many other choices unconventional to computer-animated films were also made. For example, one of the Woodsman's eyes was made bigger than the other, and Red was given only four fingers, so as to make her look more like a doll. Producer Katie Hooten explained that [...] "CG in the past has been pushing the envelope to make <b>things</b> <b>look</b> more realistic, but Hoodwinked takes things back to where CG looks a lot more like a cartoon." ...|$|E

500|$|Dawkins was {{confirmed}} into the Church of England {{at the age}} of 13, but began to grow sceptical of the beliefs. After learning about Darwinism and the scientific reason why living <b>things</b> <b>look</b> as though they have been designed, Dawkins lost the remainder of his religious faith. He said that his understanding of science and evolutionary processes led him to question how adults in positions of leadership in a civilized world could still be so uneducated in biology, and is puzzled by how belief in God could remain among individuals who are sophisticated in science. Dawkins notes that some physicists use 'God' {{as a metaphor for the}} general awe-inspiring mysteries of the universe, which causes confusion and misunderstanding among people who incorrectly think they are talking about a mystical being which forgives sins, transubstantiates wine, or makes people live after they die. He disagrees with Stephen Jay Gould's principle of nonoverlapping magisteria (NOMA) and suggests that the existence of God should be treated as a scientific hypothesis like any other. Dawkins became a prominent critic of religion and has stated his opposition to religion as twofold: religion is both a source of conflict and a justification for belief without evidence. He considers faith—belief that is not based on evidence—as [...] "one of the world's great evils".|$|E
500|$|BUF Compagnie {{served as}} the lead visual effects vender working on the film, with Digital Domain also {{providing}} work on the film. Branagh stated that BUF, who developed the effects for the race through space, were inspired by Hubble photography and other images of deep space. Branagh stated he sent paintings from classic studies by J. M. W. Turner to Digital Domain when creating Jotunheim. Peter Butterworth, VFX supervisor and co-founder of Fuel VFX, said the most challenging task was interpreting what the Bifröst would look like, [...] "You can't Google what these <b>things</b> <b>look</b> like—they are totally imagined and within {{the heads of the}} stakeholders. So to extract that and interpret it for the big screen was an interesting challenge creatively. Technically, probably creating fluid simulations that could be art-directed and used for both the Bifröst and Odin's chamber shots. Part of the difficulty with solving these is that we had to ensure they would work in stereo. In the film, Odin enters {{what is known as the}} [...] "Odinsleep" [...] in his chamber to regenerate. Butterworth stated, [...] "For Odin's Chamber, we developed a dome and curtain of light rays that hover over Odin's bed. This dome of light suggests harnessed power and energy that revitalizes him as he sleeps. We took a lot of reference from the natural world such as the corona of the sun and gave the sleep effect plenty of volume and space".|$|E
500|$|Recruiting animators for Toy Story was brisk; {{the magnet}} for talent {{was not the}} pay, {{generally}} mediocre, but rather the allure of {{taking part in the}} first computer-animated feature. Lasseter said that on the challenges of the computer animation in the film [...] "We had to make <b>things</b> <b>look</b> more organic. Every leaf and blade of grass had to be created. We had to give the world a sense of history. So the doors are banged up, the floors have scuffs." [...] The film began with animated storyboards to guide the animators in developing the characters. 27 animators worked on the film, using 400 computer models to animate the characters. Each character was either created out of clay or was first modeled off of a computer-drawn diagram before reaching the computer animated design. Once the animators had a model, articulation and motion controls were coded; this would allow each character to move in a variety of ways, such as talking, walking, or jumping. Out of all the characters, Woody was the most complex, as he required 723 motion controls, including 212 for his face and 58 for his mouth. The first piece of animation, a 30-second test, was delivered to Disney in June 1992, when the company requested a sample of what the film would look like. Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with a number of things in the test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation, such as Woody's yellow plaid shirt with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz's helmet and the decals on his space suit, or Venetian blind shadows falling across Andy's room.|$|E

500|$|Nikita and Maggie Q's {{portrayal}} of the character was met with generally positive reactions from television critics. Nikita was included in TV Guides lists of [...] "TV's Sexiest Crime Fighters" [...] and [...] "TV's Toughest Ladies". Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times felt that Q was suited for the role, stating [...] "she has a solemn, exotic beauty and hauteur that echo the heroine's self-possession and cool relentlessness," [...] adding [...] "Nikita is noticeably more hard-boiled and less girlish than the undercover agent played by Jennifer Garner on Alias, or the C.I.A. rookie that Piper Perabo plays on Covert Affairs." [...] Troy Patterson of Slate felt that [...] "Ms. Q's Nikita is only half so crush-worthy as Bionic Woman's Jaime Sommers or Dollhouse's what's-her-name, but her predicament is no less tasty." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today believed Q's performance was [...] "a fairly sizable incentive" [...] to watch the show, adding she [...] "combines stunt-fighting chops and lithe beauty with an unusual-for-the-genre air of somber intelligence. Her Nikita is not above cracking a joke, but it's clear from Q's eyes and bearing that she has suffered {{at the hands of}} evil men, and she's {{not going to take it}} anymore." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix believed that Q [...] "carries herself in a way that makes it believable she could be a hard-core killer, and she has the requisite dramatic chops and charisma for the part." [...] Maureen Ryan of AOL TV said [...] "Maggie Q, has real charisma and presence; she invests Nikita's drive to bring down the secretive Division with potent energy. You have to believe that Nikita would devote her life to wreaking vengeance on the people she views as her former captors, and you also have to buy her as a butt-kicking, gun-toting action heroine who also looks great in a cocktail gown. Maggie Q makes all those <b>things</b> <b>look</b> easy." ...|$|E

Supporters of the existence of qualia argue that since we can imagine this happening without contradiction, it follows that we are imagining a change in a property that determines the way <b>things</b> <b>look</b> to us, but that has no physical basis.

2500|$|On 6 June, Mallory and Irvine {{departed}} for Camp V at 8:40 AM with eight porters. They carried the modified oxygen apparatus with two cylinders {{as well as}} a day's ration of food.

The SAS was officially disbanded in October 1945. Prior to this the 2nd SAS War Crimes Investigation Team (2 SAS WCIT) had been formed to, amongst other <b>things,</b> <b>look</b> into the events after Loyton.

Although Lucas initially provided funds using his earnings from American Graffiti, it was inadequate. As they could not afford to dress the sets, Christian was forced to use unconventional methods and materials to achieve the desired look. He suggested that Lucas use scrap in making the dressings, and the director agreed. Christian said, [...] "I've always had this idea. I used to do it with models when I was a kid. I'd stick things on them and we'd make <b>things</b> <b>look</b> old." [...] Barry, Christian, and their team began designing the props and sets at Elstree Studios.|$|E

[...] He explained that [...] "Simpsons Cartoon Studio is awkward to operate and limited in what it can accomplish, producing animated sequences that are jerky and out of sync. The CD-ROM comes with 15 cartoons created by the developers, running from 10 seconds to 55 seconds. None flow smoothly or tell funny stories. There's no reason to expect {{the rest of us}} will do any better." [...] Similarly, Nancy Malitz of The Detroit News wrote that [...] "you move the characters around and invent the scenarios, but in the end you might feel your creativity wasn't heavily challenged. The whole deal is essentially a cut-and-paste operation. You can't create characters of your own, and the kind of automatic synchronization of sounds with movement that you see in a simple product like Video Jam isn't available, so <b>things</b> <b>look</b> sort of choppy no matter how hard you try." ...|$|E
