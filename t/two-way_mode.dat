We define and analyze the problem of wireless data scheduling. And we propose a measure, named QueryDistance(QD), which represents the degree of coherence for the data set accessed by a query. We give a practically usable method named QEM which constructs the broadcast schedule by expanding each query's data set in greedy way. We also evaluate the performance of our method by experiments. 1. Introduction In mobile environments {{there are two kinds of}} communication modes: one-way mode and <b>two-way</b> <b>mode.</b> The first is that server system broadcasts data in public channel and clients just listen to the channel. The other is that clients send request messages to the server and then receive the reply messages from the server.

40|$|A coded time/date {{information}} dissemination system (CTD), based on telephone lines and commercial modems, {{is now in}} its experimental phase in Italy at IEN. This service, born from a cooperation with other metrological laboratories (TUG, Austria, SNT, Sweden, VSL, The Netherlands), represents an attempt towards an European standardization. Some results of an experimental analysis in which a few modems were tested, both in laboratory conditions and connected to the telephone network, in order to evaluate the timing capability of the system are given. When the system is used in a one-way mode, in many practical cases the modems delay {{turns out to be the}} main factor which limits the accuracy, even more than the telephone line delays. If the <b>two-way</b> <b>mode</b> is used, the modems asymmetry, i. e., the delay difference between transmission and reception, is almost always the most important source of uncertainty, provided the link is not including a space segment. Comparing the widely used V. 22 modems to the old V. 21 ones, the latters turn out to be better both in delay time (30 - 100 ms V. 22, and 7 - 15 ms V. 21) and asymmetry (10 - 50 micro-s V. 22, and 10 ms V. 22).

40|$|Space {{weather is}} {{described}} as the variability of solar wind plasma that can disturb satellites and systems and affect human space exploration. Accurate prediction requires information of the heliosphere inside the orbit of the Earth. However, for predictions using remote sensing, one needs not only plane-of-sky position but also range information the third spatial dimension to show {{the distance to the}} plasma disturbances and thus when they might propagate or co-rotate to create disturbances at the orbit of the Earth. Appropriately processed radio signals from spacecraft having communications lines-of-sight passing through the inner heliosphere can be used for this spacetime localization of plasma disturbances. The solar plasma has an electron density- and radio-wavelength-dependent index of refraction. An approximately monochromatic wave propagating through a thin layer of plasma turbulence causes a geometrical-optics phase shift proportional to the electron density at the point of passage, the radio wavelength, and the thickness of the layer. This phase shift is the same for a wave propagating either up or down through the layer at the point of passage. This attribute can be used for space-time localization of plasma irregularities. The transfer function of plasma irregularities to the observed time series depends on the Doppler tracking mode. When spacecraft observations are in the <b>two-way</b> <b>mode</b> (downlink radio signal phase-locked to an uplink radio transmission), plasma fluctuations have a two-pulse response in the Doppler. In the <b>two-way</b> <b>mode,</b> the Doppler time series y 2 (t) is the difference between the frequency of the downlink signal received and the frequency of a ground reference oscillator. A plasma blob localized at a distance x along the line of sight perturbs the phase on both the up and down link, giving rise to two events in the two-way tracking time series separated by a time lag depending the blob s distance from the Earth: T 2 - 2 x/c, where T 2 is the two-way time-of-flight of radio waves to/from the spacecraft and c is the speed of light. In some tracking situations, more information is available. For example, with the 5 -link Cassini radio system, the plasma contribution to the up and down links, y(sub up) (t) and y(sub dn) (t), can be computed separately. The times series y(sub up) (t) and y(sub dn) (t) respond to a localized plasma blob with one event in each time series. These events are also separated in time by T 2 - 2 x/c. By cross-correlating the up and down link Doppler time series, the time separation of the plasma events can be measured and hence the plasma blob s distance from the Earth determined. Since the plane-of-sky position is known, this technique allows localization of plasma events in time and three space dimensions...|$|E

The difference of the clocks is given by A- B = 1 / 2 [R(A) - R(B) ] -k 1 / 2 [d A B- d B A...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. A new device, which utilises a {{previously}} unknown <b>two-way</b> <b>mode</b> of current switching, has been developed. This {{is the current}} switching transistor, a three-terminal electronic device which exhibits a transfer resistance, in which {{the application of a}} potential or injection of charge to one terminal controls the current at either of the two remaining terminals. The development of the current switching transistor arose from a more general project focussed on printed electronics using nanoparticulate silicon, with the aim of producing fully printed transistors. All of the printed transistors produced to date have been field-effect transistors (FETs), {{due to the fact that}} printing processes are easily applicable to the planar FET architectures. The majority of the work in the area of printed FETs has so far been focussed on the use of organic semiconducting polymers to produce organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). However, research has also been undertaken regarding the use of inorganic semiconductors, including for example, transparent metal oxides, compound semiconductors and silicon. Of the active devices, the key element is the transistor. It is essential, especially for its function as an electronic switch, in enabling a wide variety of technologies. Of particular interest are its applications in digital electronics, including logic gates, memory and comparators. The ultimate goal of printed electronics is to replace conventional electronic components with their printed equivalents, which requires the use of functional inks to deliver the desired electronic properties. Printed electronic components have potential advantages over conventional discrete and integrated circuits, especially in applications in which the printed electronics form factor is more important than the absolute technical performance of the system. Furthermore, the processes of fabrication of printed devices are far simpler and more cost efficient than those of conventional devices. This is particularly true for the current switching transistor, which can be realised by a simple two layer print...|$|E

The <b>two-way</b> {{communication}} <b>mode</b> {{used for}} sending messages to processors of interconnection networks via vertex-disjoint paths in one communication step is investigated. The complexity of communication algorithms {{is measured by}} the number of communication steps (rounds). This paper establishes a direct relationship between the gossip complexity and the vertex bisection width. More precisely, the main results are the following: 1. The lower bound 2 log 2 n Γ log 2 k Γ log 2 log 2 k Γ 2 is proved on the number of rounds of every two-way gossip algorithm working on any graph Gn;k of n nodes and vertex bisection k. 2. A graph Gn;k of n nodes and vertex bisection k, and a two-way gossip algorithm for Gn;k is constructed working in 2 log 2 n Γ log 2 k Γ log 2 log 2 k + 2 rounds. The first result improves the lower bound of 2 log 2 n 2 k. ̇...|$|R
40|$|The energy {{conservation}} law and the flow reversal theorem are valid for underwater acoustic fields. In media at rest the theorem transforms into well-known reciprocity principle. The presented parabolic equation (PE) model strictly preserves these important physical properties in the numerical solution. The new PE is obtained from the one-way wave equation by Godin (Wave motion 29, 175 - 194, 1999) via Padé approximation of the square root operator and generalized {{to the case of}} moving media. The PE is range-dependent and explicitly includes range derivatives of the medium parameters. Implicit finite difference scheme solves the PE written in terms of energy flux. Such formalism inherently provides simple and exact energy-conserving boundary condition at vertical interfaces. The finite-difference operators, the discreet boundary conditions, and the self-starter are derived by discretization of the differential PE. Discreet {{energy conservation}} and flow reversal theorem are rigorously proved as mathematical properties of the finite-difference scheme and confirmed by numerical modeling. Numerical solution is shown to be reciprocal with accuracy of 10 - 12 decimal digits, which is the accuracy of round-off errors. Energy conservation and wide-angle capabilities of the model are illustrated by comparison with <b>two-way</b> normal <b>mode</b> solutions including the ASA benchmark wedge. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, a numerically effcient {{three-dimensional}} propagation and scattering {{model is}} developed {{based on the}} three-dimensional coupled mode theory for axisymmetric bathymetry. The three-dimensional coupled mode approach applied in this thesis is fundamentally {{identical to the one}} applied in earlier models, such as the one presented by Taroudakis [20]. Thus, it is based on a Fourier expansion of the acoustic field around a seamount, with each azimuthal expansion coefficient being represented by a <b>two-way</b> coupled <b>mode</b> formulation. However, earlier formulations were severely limited in terms of frequency, size and geometry of the seamount, the seabed composition, and the distance between the source and the seamount, and are totally inadequate for modeling high-frequency, large-scale seamount problems. By introducing a number of changes in the numerical formulation and using a standard normal mode model (C-SNAP) for determining the fundamental modal solutions and coupling coefficients, orders of magnitude improvement in efficiency and fidelity has been achieved, allowing for realistic propagation and scattering scenarios to be modeled, including effects of seamount roughness and realistic sedimentary structure. (cont.) Also, by the simple superposition principle, the computational requirements are made independent of the distance between the seamount and the source and receivers, and dependent only on the geometry of the seamount and the frequency of the source. First, this thesis investigates the scattering from a cylindrical island, which is the simplest case of a conical seamount problem. Our model, using the superposition method, can solve the cylindrical problem in Athanassoulis and Prospathopoulos's paper [3] with the same accuracy while saving about 4 / 5 computational effort. Second, this thesis demonstrates the spectral coupled mode approach, which includes a <b>two-way</b> coupled <b>mode</b> model and a superposition representation of the field. Third, this thesis applies the three-dimensional model to investigate some physics issues of three-dimensional seamount scattering. As a result of the investigation, we learn that the Nx 2 D model is a poor approximation of the true three-dimensional model when the three-dimensional effects are significant, though it is a good approximation of the three-dimensional model otherwise. The convergence of the model in terms of the seamount discretization is also discussed and demonstrated. (cont.) Finally, our three-dimensional spectral coupled mode model is tested by the application of the Kermit Seamount problem with realistic ocean environmental data from the 2004 BASSEX experiment. by Wenyu Luo.
