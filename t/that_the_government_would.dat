5|$|Besides the Conservatives' {{ties to the}} CPR, Rutherford's Liberals {{enjoyed the}} incumbent's {{advantage}} of controlling the levers of patronage, and the election's result was never really in doubt. Before the election, Talbot predicted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> win 18 of the province's 25 seats. Immediately after the election {{it appeared that the}} Liberals had won 21; when all the votes had been counted they had won 23 seats to the Conservatives' two. Bennett himself was defeated in his Calgary riding. When the outcome was clear, the people of Strathcona feted Rutherford with a torchlight procession and bonfire.|$|E
5|$|Despite failing health, Mansfield {{refused to}} officially leave his post as Lord Chief Justice because George III {{was opposed to}} the {{appointment}} of Mansfield's protégé Francis Buller to the position after Mansfield resigned. The government of the time instead suggested Lloyd Kenyon as a possible successor. Mansfield clung to office until 1788, (despite not sitting in court for two years) in the hope <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> fall before {{he was forced to}} retire. This was not to be, and on 3 June, he wrote a letter of resignation effective the next day.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the value}} of foreign {{currency}} bonds which matured {{in the remainder of}} 2008 was only $600 million, and foreign currency debt service in 2009 was only $215 million, well within the government's ability to pay. However the agencies believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> have to issue more foreign currency bonds, both to cover losses as the banks' overseas operations are liquidated and also to stimulate demand in the domestic economy as Iceland goes into recession.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} protest in Ottawa, {{the capital city}} of Canada, took place on 4 February 2009 at Parliament Hill in an effort to attract the {{attention}} of Canada's parliament members. Thousands of Tamils gathered in front of the Peace Tower, subsequently drawing out a few politicians from inside, notably Bev Oda and New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jack Layton. Layton announced that he would call parliament to an emergency debate at the House of Commons. Oda announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> provide financial aid to the affected civilians, with the help of World Vision and Médecins Sans Frontières.|$|E
5|$|William Edward Forster, Chief Secretary for Ireland made {{it clear}} in a {{communication}} with the proprietor of the Dublin Daily Express {{that he would not}} allow an armed expedition of hundreds of men, as the committee was planning, and that 50 unarmed men would be sufficient to harvest the crops. He said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> consider it their duty to protect this group. On 10 November 1880, the relief expedition consisting of one contingent from County Cavan and one from County Monaghan left for County Mayo. Additional troops had already arrived in County Mayo to protect the expedition.|$|E
5|$|Already {{suffering}} from food shortages {{due to a}} five-month drought, President Fidel Castro announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> supply people {{under the age of}} 14 and those over 60, which accounts for roughly 36% of Cuba's population, with extra food aid. An estimated 156,000 tonnes of food was set aside for this action and the food was worth several million dollars. People who qualified for the aid would receive 4.4lbs (2kg) of rice and peas if they lived in western Cuba and 6.6lbs (3kg) if they lived in eastern Cuba per month until July 1999. The United Nations World Food Program provided $20.5million in aid for both the effects of the drought and Georges. By December, the Cuban Government requested $90million to help recover from the hurricane and drought. By this time, about $40million had already been set aside for the same reason. The Cuban Red Cross supplied shelter for more than 92,000 residents and supplied them with hygiene kits, food, water, and other relief materials.|$|E

5|$|Authoritarian rule {{under the}} Kuomintang ended {{gradually}} through {{a transition to}} democracy, which was marked by the lifting of martial law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining {{a high degree of}} power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks. The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng-hui. However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also stipulates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> protect and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.|$|E
5|$|In April 1972 Van der Byl {{sparked a}} row over the {{agreement}} which Rhodesia and the United Kingdom {{had made in}} November 1971. Under this agreement, Rhodesia had agreed to certain concessions to African nationalism {{in return for the}} prospect of recognition of its independence; however, implementation of the agreement was to be delayed until the Pearce Commission reported on whether the settlement proposals would be approved by the people of Rhodesia. Van der Byl insisted that Rhodesia would not implement any part of the agreement unless Rhodesia's independence was first acknowledged, regardless of the answer from the Pearce Commission. When the Pearce Commission reported that the European, Asian and Coloured (mixed race) populations of Rhodesia were in support but the African population were opposed, the agreement was ditched. Many outside and inside Rhodesia had hoped <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> implement some of the agreement even if Pearce reported against it.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, {{following}} {{the revelation that}} the News of the World had paid private investigators to hack into the phones of Milly Dowler, {{as well as the}} families of murder victims and deceased servicemen, Miliband called for News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks to resign, urged David Cameron to establish a public, judge-led inquiry into the scandal, and announced that he would force a Commons vote on whether to block the News International bid for a controlling stake in BSkyB. He also called for the Press Complaints Commission to be abolished – a call later echoed by Cameron and Nick Clegg – and called into question Cameron's judgement in hiring former News of the World editor Andy Coulson to be his director of communications. Cameron later took the unusual step of saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> back Miliband's motion that the BSkyB bid be dropped, and an hour before Miliband's motion was due to be debated, News International announced that it would withdraw the bid.|$|E

5|$|In October 1917, Lenin {{issued a}} decree {{limiting}} work {{for everyone in}} Russia to eight hours per day. He also issued the Decree on Popular Education that stipulated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> guarantee free, secular education for all children in Russia, and a decree establishing a system of state orphanages. To combat mass illiteracy, a literacy campaign was initiated; an estimated 5 million people enrolled in crash courses of basic literacy from 1920 to 1926. Embracing the equality of the sexes, laws were introduced that helped to emancipate women, by giving them economic autonomy from their husbands and removing restrictions on divorce. A Bolshevik women's organisation, Zhenotdel, was established to further these aims. Militantly atheist, Lenin and the Communist Party wanted to demolish organised religion, and in January 1918 the government decreed {{the separation of church}} and state and prohibited religious instruction in schools.|$|E
5|$|In early October 2006, Baird's {{department}} reviewed a promised $200 {{million grant}} to the City of Ottawa's light-rail expansion {{project for the}} O-Train. Baird indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> keep the funding {{at least until the}} November election, but added that the Council elected in November would have the final say on the issue. He also leaked details of the city's contact with the German firm Siemens. As a result, the rail program became a focal issue in the 2006 Ottawa mayoral election and Baird's opponents accused him of trying to influence the outcome. Baird and Ottawa Mayor Bob Chiarelli accused one another of lying about details of the project, and Liberal MP Navdeep Bains asked the Federal Ethics Commissioner to investigate Baird's decision to release details of the private contract. Chiarelli was defeated in the election and the light-rail expansion was stopped by the new council.|$|E
5|$|On this occasion, both President Tarja Halonen, and the Prime Minister {{said that}} a review was necessary, with Vanhanen {{suggesting}} that {{the time had come}} to question whether or not private persons should be allowed to own handguns, in particular automatic pistols (the kind used by Saari being a semi-automatic). He argued that Finland would only be bringing its laws into closer alignment with gun regulations the EU had set the previous summer. Halonen and Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> discuss a divergence in policy between gun control for hunting rifles and handguns. Hunting remains a highly popular sport in Finland, and the Finnish Shooting Sport Federation executive director Risto Aarrekivi said that if people wanted to commit a crime such as this, they would gain access to a handgun regardless of the law. However, he did concede that allowing beginners to buy real firearms as their first guns should be reconsidered.|$|E

5|$|One {{was that}} under the law, seniors could be denied care due to their age and the other <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> advise seniors to end their lives instead of {{receiving}} care. The ostensible basis of these claims was the provision for an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). IPAB was given the authority to recommend cost-saving changes to Medicare by facilitating the adoption of cost-effective treatments and cost-recovering measures when the statutory levels set for Medicare were exceeded within any given 3-year period. In fact, the Board was prohibited from recommending changes that would reduce payments to certain providers before 2020, and was prohibited from recommending changes in premiums, benefits, eligibility and taxes, or other changes {{that would result in}} rationing.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian {{government}} {{spent more}} than $6 million on actions related to the NAP-CHT in 2013. In September of that year, Kellie Leitch, Minister responsible for the Status of Women and Minister of Labour, announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> give the Women's Support Network of York Region $200,000 to initiate a project aimed at eradicating human trafficking in the Regional Municipality of York, and she appealed to the NAP-CHT when making the announcement. In February 2013, the Toronto City Council decided to coordinate its anti-human-trafficking efforts with the NAP-CHT. That May, during {{a meeting of the}} sixty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly at United Nations Headquarters in New York City that was convened to discuss the Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, the Canadian delegation spoke about the NAP-CHT.|$|E
5|$|The company Sotrasambandet AS {{has been}} {{established}} to lobby for and potentially debt-finance the construction, which potentially could include other parts of National Roads 555 and 561. In 2008, the company estimated {{that it might be}} possible to start construction in 2013, and complete the project by 2016. On 21 April 2009, State Secretary Geir Pollestad stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> support a bridge, but did not indicate if a two-lane or four-lane solution would be chosen. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration has recommended a four-lane bridge, while the Institute of Transport Economics has recommended the two-lane bridge. It is largely up to the city councils of Bergen and Fjell to determine which of the bridge alternatives will be chosen.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} began purchasing church run boarding {{schools in the}} 1920s. During this period capital {{costs associated with the}} schools were assumed by the government, leaving administrative and instructional duties to church officials. The hope was that minimizing facility expenditures would allow church administrators to provide higher quality instruction and support to the students in their care. Although the government was willing to, and did, purchase schools from the churches, many were acquired for free given that the rampant disrepair present in the buildings resulted in their having no economic value. Schools continued to be maintained by churches in instances where they failed to reach an agreement with government officials with the understanding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> provide support for capital costs. The understanding ultimately proved complicated {{due to the lack of}} written agreements outlining the extent and nature of that support or the approvals required to undertake expensive renovations and repairs.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, a tax {{was placed}} on land owned by the proprietors. In {{exchange}} for collecting the tax, the government promised to abandon its attempts to enforce the payment of quitrents. In 1836, a bill was passed to place a penal tax on unoccupied land. Although the Colonial Office initially refused to recommend Royal Assent, comments by Lord Durham led the Privy Council to give Royal Assent to the bill in 1838. Despite the change in property arrangements in Prince Edward Island {{with the introduction of}} these taxes, tenants were still unable to take possession of their land. In 1830, Roman Catholics were given the vote, and in 1838 the Escheat Party won a large majority in the General Assembly. Another bill to implement escheat passed the lower house, but was rejected by the Legislative Council. The leader of the Escheat Party, William Cooper, travelled to London to meet the Colonial Secretary, but he was turned away without a meeting. Instead, the Secretary advised the Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> not recommend assent to any bill advocating escheat. The Escheat Movement disintegrated.|$|E
5|$|Rogers {{outlined}} {{the request for}} the establishment of the commission, with four members to be appointed by each house of Congress and three by President Calvin Coolidge. Rodgers and Dallinger wanted $10,000 for the commission, and for Congress to authorize the issuance of commemorative coins and stamps. Rogers told the committee that the language for the legislative provisions for the coin had been borrowed from the bill for the Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar (1920–1921), and reminded them of other commemorative coins that had been issued. At the time, commemorative coins were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase the coins at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. A maximum of 300,000 coins was requested. Dallinger noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> incur no cost from the commemorative half dollars: it would profit from the seignorage and would never be called upon to redeem them, as they would be retained by collectors. After the two congressmen appeared, Chairman Luce introduced a letter from the Senate Majority Leader, Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, indicating his support for the bill. Luce reported his own version of the resolution the following day, with his committee's recommendation that it pass.|$|E
