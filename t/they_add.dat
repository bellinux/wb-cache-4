5|$|The {{different}} districts produce {{grapes of}} varying characteristics that are blended by the Champagne houses {{to create their}} distinct house styles. The Pinots of the Montagne de Reims that are planted on northern facing slopes {{are known for their}} high levels of acid and the delicacy <b>they</b> <b>add</b> to the blend. The grapes on the southern facing slope add more power and character. Grapes across the district contribute to the bouquet and headiness. The abundance of southern facing slopes in the Vallée de la Marne produces the ripest wines with full aroma. The Côte des Blancs grapes are known for their finesse and the freshness <b>they</b> <b>add</b> to blends with the extension of the nearby Côte de Sézanne offering similar though slightly less distinguished traits.|$|E
5|$|The fan crest {{was later}} {{developed}} by cutting out the figure displayed on it, {{to form a}} metal outline; this evolved in the late 13th and early 14th centuries into a three-dimensional sculpture. These were usually made of cloth, leather or paper over a wooden or wire framework, and were typically {{in the form of}} an animal; also popular were wings, horns, human figures, and panaches of feathers. These were probably worn only in tournaments, not battle: not only did <b>they</b> <b>add</b> to the already considerable weight of the helm, they could also have been used by opponents as a handle to pull the wearer's head down.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{originally}} broadcast on digital channel BBC Three from 10:30 pm on Monday, 27 October 2008, {{the same day}} as the BBC One viewing of the first episode. The episode would be repeated on the frontline BBC One a day later, during the 9 pm to 10 pm time slot. The BBC Three broadcast was viewed by 827,000 and a 7.3% audience share. It was the second most seen multichannel of the night, beaten by the first episode of Dead Set from E4. The BBC One repeat was seen by 5.06 million viewers with a 22.2 per cent; though it was down by 450,000 from the previous episode, it still won its time slot; and both broadcasts achieved a total reach of 5.89 million. According to the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board, the episode received final viewing figures of 0.93 million on BBC Three, and 5.63 million on BBC One; together <b>they</b> <b>add</b> up to 6.56 million.|$|E

5|$|The {{most popular}} local snack food is Momos, a steamed {{dumpling}} containing meat or vegetables cooked in a doughy wrapping {{and served with}} clear soup and achar. Locals love Alu Dom (Spicy steamed potato curry) and various versions of it are served. For example, <b>they</b> <b>add</b> Wai Wai Mimi instant noodles over a bowl of Alu Dom and call it Alu Mimi. Another popular Tibetan food is 'Thukpa', which is a hot noodle soup with meat, eggs and vegetables. Kinema, Chhurpi, Shaphalay,(Tibetan bread stuffed with meat). Fermented foods and beverages are consumed by {{a large percentage of}} the population. Fermented foods include preparations of soybean, bamboo shoots, milk and Sel roti, which is made from rice. Tea (esp. the butter tea) is the most popular delicacy, Alcoholic beverages include Tongba, Jnaard and Chhaang, variations of a local beer made from fermenting finger millet.|$|E
5|$|Iridescence, as {{explained}} by Thomas Young in 1803, is created when extremely thin films reflect {{part of the}} light falling on them from their top surfaces. The rest of the light goes through the films, and a further {{part of it is}} reflected from their bottom surfaces. The two sets of reflected waves travel back upwards in the same direction. But since the bottom-reflected waves travelled a little further – controlled by the thickness and refractive index of the film, and the angle at which the light fell – the two sets of waves are out of phase. When the waves are one or more whole wavelength apart – in other words at certain specific angles, <b>they</b> <b>add</b> (interfere constructively), giving a strong reflection. At other angles and phase differences, they can subtract, giving weak reflections. The thin film therefore selectively reflects just one wavelength – a pure colour – at any given angle, but other wavelengths – different colours – at different angles. So, as a thin-film structure like a butterfly's wing or bird's feather moves, it seems to change colour.|$|E
25|$|Gerontologists {{note the}} lack of {{research}} regarding and the difficulty in defining frailty. However, <b>they</b> <b>add</b> that physicians recognize frailty when they see it.|$|E
50|$|In July 2010 the McCafé added real fruit {{smoothies}} {{to their}} drink list. In November 2010 <b>they</b> <b>added</b> mocha and hot chocolate to their drink list. In July 2011 <b>they</b> <b>added</b> Frozen Strawberry Lemonade and the Mango Pineapple Smoothie to the U.S. menu.|$|R

25|$|The {{following}} {{examples and}} definitions are from Kleene (1952) pp.223–231 — many appear with proofs. Most also appear with similar names, either as proofs or as examples, in Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey 2002 pp.63–70; <b>they</b> <b>add</b> #22 the logarithm lo(x, y) or lg(x, y) {{depending on the}} exact derivation.|$|E
25|$|Buddhist {{teaching}} {{holds that}} {{a notion of}} a permanent, abiding self is a delusion {{that is one of}} the causes of human conflict on the emotional, social, and political levels. <b>They</b> <b>add</b> that an understanding of anatta provides an accurate description of the human condition, and that this understanding allows us to pacify our mundane desires.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s, by {{the time}} of the Extended Standard Theory, {{following}} the work of Joseph Emonds on structure preservation, transformations came to be viewed as holding over trees. By the end of government and binding theory in the late 1980s, transformations are no longer structure changing operations at all; instead <b>they</b> <b>add</b> information to already existing trees by copying constituents.|$|E
25|$|Orichalcum : is used {{primarily}} by the Solar Exalted. Orichalcum is rarely found in pure deposits; usually, it is created out of gold that has been heated by lava and sunlight reflected from mirrors of occult design. Orichalcum weapons excel at no one thing; instead of adding a large bonus to speed, damage or defense, <b>they</b> <b>add</b> a small bonus to all.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear power, and {{geothermal}} {{power may}} be classed as heat pollutants as <b>they</b> <b>add</b> heat {{energy to the}} biosphere that would not otherwise be released. The net quantity of energy conversion within the biosphere due to the utilisation of wind power, solar power, tidal power, hydroelectric power (hydroelectricity) is static and {{is derived from the}} effects of sunlight and the movement of the moon and planets.|$|E

25|$|The Vaishnava origin {{theories}} {{rely on the}} iconographic {{details and}} the typical presence of the triad of deities, something that Buddhist, Jaina and tribal origins theories have difficulty in coherently explaining. The colors, state the scholars of the Vaishnava origin theory, link to black-colored Krishna and white-colored Balarama. <b>They</b> <b>add</b> that the goddess originally was Ekanamsa (Durga of Shaiva-Shakti tradition, sister of Krishna through his foster family). She was later renamed to Shubhadra (Lakshmi) per Vaishnava terminology for the divine feminine.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} the complex plane allows a {{geometric}} interpretation of complex numbers. Under addition, <b>they</b> <b>add</b> like vectors. The multiplication of two complex numbers can be expressed most easily in polar coordinates — the magnitude or modulus of the product {{is the product of}} the two absolute values, or moduli, and the angle or argument of the product is the sum of the two angles, or arguments. In particular, multiplication by a complex number of modulus 1 acts as a rotation.|$|E
25|$|In the debate, {{although}} {{he admitted that}} man must have at some point contributed to global warming but not necessarily caused it, Crichton argued {{that most of the}} media and attention of the general public are being dedicated to the uncertain anthropogenic global warming scares instead of the more urgent issues like poverty. He also suggested that private jets be banned as <b>they</b> <b>add</b> more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere {{for the benefit of the}} few who could afford them.|$|E
50|$|Later <b>they</b> <b>added</b> {{the flag}} of Tanzania {{in front of the}} 'T'.|$|R
50|$|No longer {{performing}} in grey flannel suits, {{the group has}} continued to grow and evolve with the changing times. The Chattertocks started recording early on {{with a number of}} vinyl albums. In the mid-1960s <b>they</b> <b>added</b> guitar and percussion back-up, both common for college singing groups. In 1982 <b>they</b> <b>added</b> choreography and comedy skits to their concerts.|$|R
5000|$|...Honey☆Hime: in January 2015 they debuted as J-pop idol cover {{group in}} several Anime Convention Stages.

Now {{the group is}} still three members (Kotomì and Hachi left, but <b>they</b> <b>added</b> Puchiko in December 2015).In 2016 they will start {{producing}} original songs too.|$|R
25|$|Alkynes are {{characteristically}} more unsaturated than alkenes. Thus <b>they</b> <b>add</b> two equivalents of bromine whereas an alkene adds {{only one}} equivalent in the reaction. Other reactions are listed below. In some reactions, alkynes are less reactive than alkenes. For example, in a molecule with an -ene and an -yne group, addition occurs preferentially at the -ene. Possible explanations involve the two π-bonds in the alkyne delocalising, which {{would reduce the}} energy of the π-system or the stability of the intermediates during the reaction.|$|E
25|$|Content {{subtitles}} are a North American Secondary Industry (non-Hollywood, often low-budget) staple. <b>They</b> <b>add</b> content dictation that {{is missing}} from filmed action or dialogue. Due to the general low-budget allowances in such films, it is often more feasible to add the overlay subtitles to fill in information. They are most commonly seen on America's Maverick films as forced subtitles, and on Canada's MapleLeaf films as optional subtitles. Content subtitles also appear {{in the beginning of}} some higher-budget films (e.g., Star Wars) or {{at the end of a}} film (e.g., Gods and Generals).|$|E
25|$|Other critics such as Martin Evans expand upon Mack's {{notion of}} built in mystery, {{claiming}} {{that even the}} textual discrepancies between the three known versions may actually be deliberate (or {{at the very least}} <b>they</b> <b>add</b> to the effect). Evans also argues that Shakespeare's impenetrable text and Hamlet's 'unplayable' strings could be meant to reflect the deep anxieties that were felt in an era of philosophical, scientific and religious disorientation. The works (and actions) of Machiavelli, Copernicus and Luther had upset hierarchical notions of virtue, order and salvation that had persisted since the Middle Ages.|$|E
