In return, Law promised the French government <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> their debt at low rates of interest. Law began a financial speculative bubble by selling shares of the Mississippi Company, using the Banque Générales virtual monopoly on the issue of bank notes <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> his investors.|$|E

40|$|Financing {{constraints}} {{have been}} identified as an additional source of firm heterogeneity that affects export participation and export performance. This paper examines whether and <b>to</b> what extent <b>financing</b> constraints affect firms’ exporting across different types of firms and industries. It uses comparable micro data from France, Germany, Italy and Spain and estimates the sensitivity of firms’ extensive and intensive margins of exporting <b>to</b> <b>financing</b> constraints. The empirical results indicate that firms which were less constrained financially were more likely <b>to</b> export, while <b>financing</b> constraints did not affect the export intensity of existing exporters. It appears that financing constraints affect export participation via firms’ productivity. The sensitivity of exporting to access <b>to</b> external <b>financing</b> appears <b>to</b> be most important for young, domestic-owned and firms in traditional industries. The sensitivity of the export propensity <b>to</b> <b>financing</b> constraints decreased with firm size...|$|R
