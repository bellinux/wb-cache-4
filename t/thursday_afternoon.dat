5|$|Official {{opening ceremonies}} were held on <b>Thursday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> April 27, 1967. The ceremonies were an invitation-only event, held at Place des Nations. Canada's Governor General, Roland Michener, proclaimed the {{exhibition}} open after the Expo flame was ignited by Prime Minister Pearson. On hand were over 7,000 media and invited guests including 53 heads of state. Over 1,000 reporters covered the event, broadcast in NTSC Colour, live via satellite, to a worldwide audience of over 700 million viewers and listeners.|$|E
5|$|The {{second session}} on <b>Thursday</b> <b>afternoon</b> saw {{considerably}} less running than the first. A red flag was shown ten minutes into practice after Roberto Merhi crashed on the exit of the tunnel. During the stoppage, rain began to fall, keeping most drivers {{in the garage}} when practice was restarted. It was not until ten minutes {{from the end of}} the session that the drivers took to the track again, but under damp conditions they managed times that were slower than the pace set at the beginning. Lewis Hamilton finished the session fastest, more than seven-tenths of a second in front of his team mate. Toro Rosso confirmed their high pace with Carlos Sainz Jr. and Max Verstappen in sixth and seventh respectively, while McLaren proved they might challenge for points as predicted, with Fernando Alonso in eighth place.|$|E
5|$|In second {{practice}} on <b>Thursday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> Ricciardo was fastest, setting {{a time of}} 1:14.607, {{more than half a}} second clear of Hamilton in second place. Rosberg and Verstappen, in third and fourth, were the only other drivers to get within a second of Ricciardo, while the two Williams drivers Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa struggled, ending the session 14th and 16th respectively. At Ferrari, Kimi Räikkönen was fastest in seventh spot. His teammate, Vettel, had an incident-packed session that eventually ended with him setting the ninth fastest time. He spun at Mirabeau corner, damaging his rear wing, only to hit the wall in turn one after coming back to the track, albeit continuing with wheel rim damage. A VSC period occurred after Romain Grosjean crashed into the outside barrier at the exit of the tunnel. Two more VSC periods ensued when Rio Haryanto touched the inside barrier at the same spot and later after Kevin Magnussen crashed at the final corner.|$|E

5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Thursday and a {{third on}} Friday—were held before the Saturday race. The <b>Thursday</b> <b>afternoon</b> and evening sessions lasted 90 minutes; the third, one-hour session was held on Friday afternoon. The first session was held in sunny weather conditions. The No. 1 Porsche 919 Hybrid driven by Hartley led the 90-minute period through its mid-way point with the fastest lap time of the day, at one minute and 58.012 seconds, almost six-tenths of a second ahead of team-mate Jani in second. Audi's second R18 was twice shown a black and orange flag {{because of a lack}} of telemetry for which the team was given a €1,000 suspended fine for the remainder of the race weekend and were required to change the vehicle's battery. LMP2 was led by Pipo Derani's No. 31 Extreme Speed Motorsports Oreca with a lap of two minutes and 8.974 seconds which was recorded within the session's first-quarter. Adam's No. 97 Aston Martin was quickest in the LMGTE Pro while Pedro Lamy helped the British manufacturer to be fastest in LMGTE Am.|$|E

25|$|Wartime {{censorship}} prevented {{news of the}} storming of Government House in Darwin {{reaching the}} national press until the following <b>Thursday</b> <b>afternoon.</b> The news was received with great interest.

25|$|At the TT races {{there is}} usually one week of {{practice}} and one week of racing. Historically there was an early morning practice session from 05:00–07:30am but this was discontinued from the 2004 races. During an early morning practice at the 1927 Isle of Man TT, Archie Birkin, brother of Tim Birkin of the Bentley Boys, was killed at Rhencullen. From 1928 practice sessions for the Isle of Man TT Races and Manx Grand Prix were held on closed roads. Evening practice sessions were introduced for the 1937 Isle of Man TT and continue to this day. The <b>Thursday</b> <b>afternoon</b> practice session from 13:45–17:00, introduced in the late 1950s, was discontinued from the Centenary races in 2007.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, civic museum {{culture was}} still {{in the early stages of}} its development, as {{illustrated}} by the very limited opening hours of the Haus zur Mücke (<b>Thursday</b> <b>afternoon</b> from two to four in the afternoon, otherwise on request). The first records of regular gallery visits by city residents and outside visitors date to this period. In the three centuries before and after 1800, most of the collection activities involved objects of natural history, with a substantial number of acquisitions and gifts in this area. The numerous top-level art objects that made their way to Basel in the 1790s from Revolutionary France, on the other hand, did not find a wide audience of buyers and in most cases were resold.|$|E
25|$|Idle {{stated that}} the two things that made his life bearable were {{listening}} to Radio Luxembourg under the bedclothes and watching the local football team, Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite this, he disliked other sports and would sneak out of school every <b>Thursday</b> <b>afternoon</b> to the local cinema. Idle was eventually caught watching the X-rated film BUtterfield 8 (suitable for audiences aged 16 years and over under the contemporary film certificates) and stripped of his prefecture, though by that time he was head boy. Idle had already refused to be senior boy in the school cadet force, as he supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and {{had participated in the}} yearly Aldermaston March. Idle maintains that there was little to do at the school, and boredom drove him to study hard and consequently win a place at Cambridge University.|$|E
25|$|Before {{releasing}} the jury for deliberation, Judge Learned Hand altered {{the charges against}} the defendants and attempted to preface the jury of their constitutional duties. Hand dismissed all the charges against Josephine Bell, and dismissed the first count – “conspiracy to cause mutiny and refusal of duty”—against the remaining defendants. Prior to {{releasing the}} jurors, Judge Hand stated, “I {{do not have to}} remind you that every man has the right to have such economic, philosophic or religious opinions as seem to him best, whether they be socialist, anarchistic or atheistic.” After deliberating from <b>Thursday</b> <b>afternoon</b> to Saturday, the jury returned with two decisions. First, the jury was unable to come to a unanimous decision. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the jurors seeking to convict the defendants blamed one juror for being unable to conform to the majority opinion, as he was also a socialist and, consequently, un-American. Not only did the other eleven jurors demand the prosecutor to levy charges against the lone juror) but moved to drag the socialist supporter out into the street and lynch him. Judge Hand, given the uproar, declared a mistrial.|$|E

25|$|The {{qualifying}} period was {{split into two}} sessions; the first was held on <b>Thursday</b> <b>afternoon</b> and ran for 40 minutes with the second held on Friday afternoon and lasted 30 minutes. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards his final starting position for the qualification race. Félix da Costa set a late provisional pole position lap time of two minutes and 11.535 seconds, two-tenths of a second faster than Ilott who held the pole until Félix da Costa's time. Rosenqvist was third-fastest, ahead of Yamashita in fourth and Juncadella fifth. Sette Cãmara, Norris, Cassidy, Hughes and Sam MacLeod completed the top-ten provisional starting positions. Sims was the fastest driver not to record {{a time in the}} top ten and was 1.065 seconds off Félix da Costa's pace. He was followed by Maini, Russell, Anthoine Hubert and Günther with Ticktum, Pedro Piquet, Chang Wing Chung, Nikita Mazepin and Joel Eriksson completing the top-twenty fastest drivers. The session was red flagged four times: firstly for Yamashita when his wheel became detached from his car, possibly from a split rim, the second was for Sims who was stranded in the centre of Lisboa corner's run-off area, Norris impacted the San Francisco Bend barriers and Eriksson hit the Solitude Esses wall, triggering the third stoppage, and the session ended early when Juncadella crashed heavily into the Fisherman's Bend turn barrier.|$|E
25|$|The {{qualifying}} period was {{split into two}} sessions; the first was held on <b>Thursday</b> <b>afternoon</b> and ran for 40 minutes with the second held on Friday afternoon and lasting for 30 minutes. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards his final starting position for the qualification race. The first qualifying session saw Rosenqvist {{come out on top}} with a time of two minutes and 11.842 seconds on the final lap of the session with new tyres. He was eight-tenths of a second quicker than the best-placed rookie Ilott in second position with teammate Giovinazzi another thousandth of a second in arrears in third place. Ilott and Giovinazzi held the lead at various points in the session before Rosenqvist's last lap effort. Sam MacLeod improved on his last lap to end the session in fourth place having had four new tyres installed at his pit stop. On his last timed lap, Juncadella recovered from an earlier free practice gearbox problem to end up provisionally fifth. Having been in contention for much of first qualifying, Pommer finished sixth, with Sekiguci and Mikkel Jensen in close proximity on the time sheets. Gustavo Menezes and Sims rounded out the top ten. Following them were Charles Leclerc, Kanamaru with Stroll and Arjun Maini provisionally lining up on the seventh row of the grid. Alessio Lorandi was next up ahead of Dennis–whose air restrictor fell off his car and then suffered gearbox issues–Dorian Boccolacci, Yamashita, Santino Ferrucci and Cassidy. The rest of the order was completed by Albon, Sérgio Sette Câmara, Martin Cao, Ryan Tveter, Takaboshi, Matt Solomon, Zhi Cong Li and Wing Chung Chang. The session passed relatively smoothly, with only Sette Câmara running into the barriers, and then stopping at San Francisco Hill so he could not risk any further damage by driving back to the pit lane.|$|E
25|$|The {{qualifying}} period was {{split into two}} sessions; the first was held on <b>Thursday</b> <b>afternoon</b> and ran for 40 minutes with the second held on Friday afternoon and lasted 30 minutes. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards his final starting position for the qualification race. The first qualifying session saw Rosenqvist {{come out on top}} with a late lap time of two minutes and 12.751 seconds. He achieved this effort despite not slipstreaming any other car and recovered the lost time through the final sections of the track. Rosenqvist ended up 0.111 seconds faster than Félix da Costa with Sims a further three-tenths of a second in arrears in third place. Harry Tincknell finished the session in fourth place with Pipo Derani following in fifth having held the lead of first qualifying in the opening minutes. Sainz ended up sixth in front of Coletti and Marciello with Korjus and Jaafar—who was forced to abort his fastest time because of red flags—rounding out the top ten. Auer was the fastest driver not to reach the top ten although he was fourth {{in the early stages of}} qualifying before other drivers improved on their best efforts. Following him were Blomqvist, King the highest-placed rookie, with Giovnazzi provisionally joining King on the seventh row. Sekiguchi was next up ahead of William Buller, Nakayama, Ocon, Katsumasa Chiyo and Nicholas Latifi. The rest of the order was completed by Bryant-Meisner, Mason, Jones, van de Laar, Sean Gelael, Lynn and Sun. Wolf did not compete a lap time during qualifying because of the damage sustained to his car in the first practice session. Lynn crashed his car at Fisherman's Bend in the opening minutes of qualifying which was temporarily halted to enable marshals to push his car in a safe location. The session ended early with one minute and 37 seconds remaining after Nakayama broke his suspension in a heavy impact with the wall at Solitude Esses corner. Nakayama was unhurt.|$|E
