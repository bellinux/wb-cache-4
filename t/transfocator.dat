40|$|An x-ray <b>transfocator</b> {{design for}} the {{combined}} use of 1 D and 2 D compound refractive lenses is described. The device includes stacks of beryllium parabolic lenses with different radii of curvature and provides microfocused x-ray beams in the 4 - 20 keV photon energy range. The <b>transfocator</b> has been implemented at the P 10 Coherence Beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron at DESY, Hamburg. Results of <b>transfocator</b> performance and applications for coherent x-ray scattering experiments are presented...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a tunable X-ray focusing apparatus, {{referred to as}} a <b>transfocator,</b> based on compound refractive lenses. By varying the number of lenses in the beam, the X-ray energy focused and the focal length can be varied continuously throughout a large range of energies and distances. The instrument can be used in both white and monochromatic beams to focus, pre-focus or collimate the beam. The <b>transfocator</b> can be used with other monochromators and/or other focusing elements, leading to significant increases in flux. Furthermore, the chromatic nature of the focusing means the <b>transfocator</b> suppresses harmonics and can also be used as an extremely high flux broadband-pass monochromator. These devices have been installed in the first optics and second experimental hutches at the ID 11 beamline at the ESRF. Keywords: compound refractive lens; X-ray optics; monochromator; microfocus. 1...|$|E
40|$|Thermal neutron beams are an {{indispensable}} tool in physics research. The spatial and the temporal resolution attainable in experiments {{are dependent on}} the flux and collimation of the neutron beam which remain relatively poor, even for modern neutron sources. These difficulties may be mitigated {{by the use of}} optics for focusing and imaging. Refractive and diffractive optical elements, e. g. compound refractive lenses and Fresnel zone plates, are attractive due to their low cost, and simple alignment. These optical elements, however, suffer from chromatic aberration, which limit their effectiveness to highly monochromatic beams. This paper presents two novel concepts for focusing and imaging non-monochromatic thermal neutron beams with well-known optical elements: (1) a fast mechanical <b>transfocator</b> based on a compound refractive lens, which actively varies the number of individual lenses in the beam path to focus and image a time-of-flight beam, and (2) a passive optical element consisting of a compound refractive lens, and a Fresnel zone plate, which may focus and image both continuous and pulsed neutron beams.

40|$|International audienceModern {{synchrotron}} radiation sources are usually equipped with state-of-the-art focusing setups. In the last decade, modular arrays of compound refractive lenses, {{the so called}} <b>transfocators,</b> have emerged as adjustable focusing optics elements. Several arrays {{of more than one}} hundred lenses are distributed in the x-ray beam path to obtain optimal focusing; however, fully wave-optical simulations of such set-ups are still missing. We present a simple toolbox of distributed computer codes to numerically propagate an x-ray beam through a sequence of <b>transfocators,</b> illuminated by a point-source and a partially coherent extended sourc...|$|R
50|$|Lux Aeterna Theater has no {{stationary}} location and operates internationally; {{it can be}} easily assembled on various sites. The premises must include a projection surface (planetarium, dome hemisphere, panoramic projection screen, etc.), seats, and an optical pad behind the seats, projectors, and remote control. The optical pad is a metal plate with drilled holes in the grid and with threaded openings. The drives are positioning the optical elements into the beam or slow-acting control beam {{with a set of}} lines. Each line of the laser creates a separate image. The method, resulting in interference patterns on flat surfaces, is based on the use of accidental phase modulation, which occurs when a laser beam passing through optically heterogeneous mediums is refracted at different points and angles along its way, resulting in interference patterns projected on a screen that change in contour and texture with each change in medium. The medium is made of solid transparent matter (e.g. moving plates of non-uniform structure -usually round discs mounted in a revolving cassette. And as a result, a wide selection of visual character, image, shapes, effect appears on a screen. Or/and an additional lens is used to concentrate the light field. Or/and <b>transfocators</b> are mounted at the beam's point of exit. These form-building methods can be used in the same cassettes (to increase image possibilities) with diffraction gratings, curvilinear reflectors or a large moving lens (for the deformation of light imago). Lighting plot involves complex abstract light ductile movements. The projection tool allows receiving on-screen a very complex dynamics of light colorful shapes, to create a light accompaniment by colorful, graphic, structural visualization of thematic development, to unite music, musical sounds, and musical noises with light content. It also allows the spatial separation and motion of different audio content, voices, melody and musical instruments.|$|R
