500|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the war, county cricket resumed in 1946, during which year Seamer played two matches with little success. He did not appear in first-class cricket in 1947, but was named as one of three captains of Somerset in 1948. Jack Meyer had reluctantly captained the side in 1947, but stepped {{down at the end of}} the season: he was having problems with his sight, and required daily painkillers for lumbago. There was no obvious replacement for Meyer; like many counties Somerset would not consider having a professional captain, and finding an amateur with the time and money to lead the side was proving troublesome. So, with no single candidate suitable, the Somerset committee announced that the club would be captained first by Mitchell-Innes during his leave from the Sudan, then Seamer during his own leave. Once both of these had returned to their duties, George Woodhouse would take over. In his history of Somerset County Cricket Club, Peter Roebuck describes the situation as a [...] "remarkable state of affairs", while David Foot suggests that the true number of captains was closer to seven. During his time as captain, Seamer carried an old <b>train</b> <b>board</b> saying [...] "To Tonbridge" [...] in his cricket bag, claiming that it brought good luck to the team. In the eleven matches that Somerset played under his captaincy though, only one resulted in a victory. Seamer claimed that some of his best friends at the club were among the professionals, who he praised for their team spirit, despite the strained leadership changes. His friendship with the professionals was in contrast to the attitudes of both the club's committee, and its captain for the previous season. Meyer had been unpopular with the professionals due to his attitude to the game, and the manner in which he utilised them, while the club's committee felt that the professional players deserved little recognition when successful, claiming that this was what they were paid for. Seamer's batting was no longer strong enough to support his inclusion in the team, and he played low in the middle order. He failed to reach double figures in any of his first seven innings that season, but recorded a half-century against Kent in his final match for Somerset, his first since 1936 in first-class cricket.|$|E

Reference source not found.). Pilot activities will be conducted in the following four areas: Development of Pilot Projects: Foundation support to three pilot projects will focus on joint efforts by governments, businesses and community groups to improve the delivery of local social services. Additional financing to existing alliances {{will be used to}} expand and enhance the provision of services so they may be made available to a larger group of beneficiaries. Technical assistance and training will enhance local capacity to promote strategic alliances in the region. The Foundation will organize workshops to <b>train</b> <b>board</b> members and management staff of independent, non-profit organizations in administrative and business skills.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to better understand and identify key themes related to how Navajo students 2 ̆ 7 cultural identity may be affected while living in an off-reservation residential hall. Phinney 2 ̆ 7 s ethnic identity development theory was used to explain the psychosocial process of developing industry and identity in adolescents. The primary research question addressed how former students 2 ̆ 7 experiences of living in an off-reservation residence hall affected their development of cultural identity. A qualitative case study design was used. A purposeful sample of 12 Navajo former {{students who}} lived in a Bureau of Indian Education off-reservation residential hall between 2010 - 2014 was interviewed. The interviews were coded, and 7 themes related to loss of native language ability, yearning for native language and culture, tutoring, supportive teachers, responsibility and independence, generational legacy, and culture were identified. Based on the findings, a professional development plan was developed to <b>train</b> <b>board</b> members, administrators, and staff at the study site about how to promote students 2 ̆ 7 development of positive cultural identity while living in a residential hall. With this knowledge, residential hall leaders and staff may be better able to ensure that Navajo students in their charge achieve successful educational outcomes and retain their tribal culture, practices, and language, to ensure that Navajo students can achieve successful educational outcomes and a positive cultural identity...|$|E
