5|$|Loss {{of habitat}} {{is the other}} major threat to the corn crake, since drained and fertilised silage fields are less {{suitable}} for breeding than traditional hay meadows. In western Europe the conversion of grassland to arable land has been aided by subsidies, and further east the collapse of collective farming {{has led to the}} abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area. More localised threats include floods in spring, and disturbance by roads or wind farms, and the loss of many birds – up to 14,000 a year – in Egypt, where migrating birds are captured in nets set for the quail with which they often migrate. Although this may account for 0.5–2.7% of the European population, the losses to this form of hunting are less than when the <b>targeted</b> <b>species</b> were more numerous and predictable.|$|E

40|$|Restoration of {{semi-natural}} {{calcareous grassland}} needs to overcome dispersal limitation and microsite limitation. The effectiveness of sowing {{a mix of}} ten <b>target</b> <b>species</b> in combination with various pre-sowing disturbance techniques and post-establishment management regimes in overcoming these limitations, and in promoting vegetation change towards the restoration target was tested in a field experiment. Our results illustrate the importance of bare ground for introducing <b>target</b> <b>species</b> of calcareous grassland into species-poor grassland, and the slowness of colonisation by additional <b>target</b> <b>species</b> from outside even when a site is situated close to high-quality grassland {{that could serve as}} source for additional <b>target</b> <b>species...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Relative Importance Index (RII) {{method for}} {{determination}} of appropriate <b>target</b> <b>species</b> for dynamic adaptive chemistry (DAC) simulations using the directed relation graph with error propagation (DRGEP) method {{was developed and}} validated for two fuels. The conventional method of DRGEP <b>target</b> <b>species</b> selection involves picking an static set of <b>target</b> <b>species</b> based on the expected major combustion processes; however, these static <b>target</b> <b>species</b> may not remain important throughout a combustion simulation. The RII method determines appropriate DRGEP <b>target</b> <b>species</b> solely from the local thermochemical state of the simulation, enabling DAC simulations to better respond to changing combustion conditions while ensuring that accuracy is maintained. Further, the RII method reduces the expertise required of users to select DRGEP <b>target</b> <b>species</b> sets. The RII method was tested on constant volume ignition delay studies as well as single-cell engine simulations under homogenous charge compression ignition (HCCI) conditions for n-heptane and isopentanol reaction mechanisms. It is illustrated that the RII is capable of accurate predictions of constant volume ignition delays {{over a wide range}} of starting conditions. Further, for a similar maximum error in ignition delay predictions, under certain autoignition conditions the RII method produced considerably smaller local skeletal mechanisms compared to those of conventional DRGEP <b>target</b> <b>species</b> selections; however, both methods generated similarly sized local skeletal mechanisms outside these regions. In addition, the RII method was capable of accurately predicting ignition crank angles for single cell engine simulations under HCCI conditions with significantly smaller local skeletal mechanisms than conventional DRGEP <b>target</b> <b>species</b> selections...|$|R

25|$|Since the {{practice}} of trawling started (around the 15th century), there have been concerns over trawling's lack of selectivity. Trawls may be non-selective, sweeping up both marketable and undesirable fish and fish of both legal and illegal size. Any part of the catch which cannot be used is considered by-catch, some of which is killed accidentally by the trawling process. By-catch commonly includes valued species such as dolphins, sea turtles, and sharks, and may also include sublegal or immature individuals of the <b>targeted</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E

In Shark Bay it can comprise up to 20% of the entire whiting catch, with fishermen giving it the name 'bastard whiting' as large numbers of S. vittata mean lower numbers of their <b>targeted</b> <b>species.</b> Of the approximately 177 000kg of whiting taken in Western Australia, less than 2152kg of this is attributable to S. vittata, making it one of the less important fisheries to the state.|$|E
25|$|Gillnetters – On {{inland waters}} and inshore, {{gillnets}} can be operated from open boats and canoes. In coastal waters, they are operated by small decked vessels which {{can have their}} wheelhouse either aft or forward. In coastal waters, gillnetting is often used as a second fishing method by trawlers or beam trawlers, depending on fishing seasons and <b>targeted</b> <b>species.</b> For offshore fishing, or fishing on the high seas, medium-sized vessels using drifting gillnets are called drifters, and the bridge is usually located aft. The nets are set and hauled by hand on small open boats. Larger boats use hydraulic or occasionally mechanical net haulers, or net drums. These vessels can be equipped with an echosounder, although locating fish is {{more a matter of}} the fishermen's personal knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than depending on special detection equipment.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of {{population}} management on the community a <b>target</b> <b>species</b> belongs to is of key importance for successful management. It is known that the removal or extinction of a single species in a community may lead to extinctions of other community members. In our study we assess the impacts of population management on competitive communities, studying the response of both locally stable and unstable communities of varying size (between four and ten species) to three different management strategies; harvesting of a <b>target</b> <b>species,</b> harvesting with non-targeted catch, and stocking of the <b>target</b> <b>species.</b> We also studied the consequences of selecting <b>target</b> <b>species</b> with different relative abundances, as well as {{the effects of}} varying environmental conditions. We show here how the effects of management in competitive communities extend far beyond the target population. A crucial role is played by the underlying stability properties of the community under management. In general, locally unstable communities are more vulnerable to perturbation through management. Furthermore, the community response is shown {{to be sensitive to the}} relative density of the <b>target</b> <b>species.</b> Of considerable interest is the result that even a small (2. 5...|$|R

500|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the bowmouth guitarfish as Vulnerable. It {{is threatened by}} fishing and by habitat destruction and degradation, particularly from blast fishing, coral bleaching, and siltation.

The IUCN has given this species a regional assessment of Near Threatened in Australian waters, where it is not a <b>targeted</b> <b>species</b> but is taken as bycatch in bottom trawls. The installation of turtle excluder devices on some Australian trawlers has benefited this species.

500|$|White sharks also attack {{dolphins}} and porpoises from above, behind {{or below}} {{to avoid being}} detected by their echolocation. <b>Targeted</b> <b>species</b> include dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops ssp.), Humpback dolphins (Sousa ssp.), harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), and Dall's porpoises (Phocoenoides dalli). Groups of dolphins have occasionally been observed defending themselves from sharks with mobbing behaviour. White shark predation on other species of small cetacean has also been observed. In August 1989, a [...] juvenile male pygmy sperm whale (Kogia breviceps) was found stranded in central California with a bite mark on its caudal peduncle from a great white shark. In addition, white sharks attack and prey upon beaked whales. Cases where an adult Stejneger's beaked whale (Mesoplodon stejnegeri), with a mean mass of around , and a juvenile Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris), an individual estimated at , were hunted and killed by great white sharks have also been observed.
