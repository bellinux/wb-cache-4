5|$|Large {{sections}} of the hull plating seem to have fallen off well before the wreck hit the bottom. One such section, {{thought to have been}} from the galleys, separated from the stern in one piece and landed nearby. The force of the water <b>tore</b> <b>up</b> the poop deck and folded it back on itself. The center propeller is totally buried, while the force of the impact caused the two wing propellers and shafts to be bent upwards by an angle of about 20°.|$|E
5|$|Miller's {{season ended}} early {{when he was}} {{recalled}} to duty. However, he had continued disciplinary problems, and left the Militia on 8 November 1941. Miller and a friend then attempted to join the Royal Australian Navy. When the navy rejected his friend, Miller <b>tore</b> <b>up</b> his own paperwork, left the recruiting office, and walked {{around the corner to}} the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) recruiting office, where he enlisted.|$|E
2500|$|Luckner {{had great}} {{physical}} strength and was noted {{for his ability}} to bend coins between the thumb, index, and middle finger of his right hand and to <b>tear</b> <b>up</b> telephone directories (the thickest being that of New York City), with his bare hands. On the occasion of his visit to Australia in 1938, the Sydney Labor Daily published a cartoon showing Kaiser Wilhelm <b>tearing</b> <b>up</b> the Belgian Neutrality Pact, Adolf Hitler <b>tearing</b> <b>up</b> another agreement, and Luckner <b>tearing</b> <b>up</b> a directory, with the caption [...] "They All Have the Habit".|$|R

5|$|The {{land for}} the fort was {{appropriated}} from James Roach, a building contractor in Washington who was the second-largest landowner in the county, behind only the Lee family. Soldiers <b>tore</b> <b>up</b> land, dug trenches, and used gardens for latrines. Roach's mansion on Prospect Hill was vandalized by Union forces during the construction of Fort Runyon, but survived the war and was demolished in 1965. Other land for Fort Runyon and Fort Jackson came from the demolition of Jackson City, a collection of gambling establishments, saloons, and a racetrack that were located {{at the southern end}} of the Long Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Marseille {{tried to}} radio his {{position}} but {{was forced to}} bail out over the sea. He paddled around in the water for three hours before being rescued by a Heinkel He 59 float plane based at Schellingwoude. Severely worn out and suffering from exposure, {{he was sent to}} a field hospital. I.(Jagd)/LG 2 claimed three aerial victories for the loss of four Bf 109s that day. Marseille was in serious trouble when arriving back at the airfield. He had abandoned his leader Staffelkapitän Adolf Buhl, who was shot down and killed. He received a stern rebuke and final warning from Herbert Ihlefeld, during which he <b>tore</b> <b>up</b> his flight evaluations with a visibly upset Marseille looking on. Other pilots were voicing their dissent concerning Marseille. Because of his alienation of other pilots, his arrogant and unapologetic nature, Ihlefeld would eventually dismiss Marseille from LG 2.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{also played}} a key role in the secessionist {{struggle}} against the Portuguese Empire and the struggle for black majority rule in Southern Africa. Control of Somalia was of great interest to both the Soviet Union and the United States, due to the country's strategic location at the mouth of the Red Sea. After the Soviets broke foreign relations with Siad Barre's regime in Somalia, the Soviets turned to the Derg Government in Ethiopia and supported them in their war against Somalia. Because the Soviets changed their allegiance, Barre expelled all Soviet advisers, <b>tore</b> <b>up</b> his friendship treaty with the Soviet Union, and switched allegiance to the West. The United States took the Soviet Union's place in the 1980s in the aftermath of Somalia's loss in the Ogaden War.|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} {{originally planned}} to film the teaser sequence at a Catholic hospital, but {{the hospital was}} reluctant to affix a faux gargoyle to the building. Thus, the shot was relocated to Heritage Hall, a noted filming location and former post office in Vancouver. Some last minute scrambling was required when city workmen <b>tore</b> <b>up</b> the sidewalk on the very spot where the producers planned to film the scene. The construction crew reassured the show that the construction would be finished in time for filming. Indeed, the work was finished two hours before shooting of the episode started. Additional exterior shots were filmed at an alley near Bonanza Meat Market. The walls were painted to match those of Heritage Hall, although after filming was completed, they were returned to their original state.|$|E
5|$|Miller's {{season ended}} early {{after he was}} called back for army service and he was {{stationed}} in the northern suburb of Broadmeadows. However, he had disciplinary problems and disliked taking orders from his officers, whom he often felt were inferior to him. He left the Militia on 8 November 1941. Miller and a friend then attempted to join the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) as stokers. When the navy would not take his friend, Miller <b>tore</b> <b>up</b> his paperwork in protest, left the recruiting office, and walked {{around the corner to}} the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) recruiting office. He was acutely aware of the risks, as many of his playing colleagues had been killed, injured or captured. The threat of combat increased when the Pacific Theatre of World War II opened on 7 December 1941 with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The 194142 cricket season was cancelled and many cricket and football grounds were converted into army bases.|$|E
5|$|The other {{featured}} preliminary {{match was}} Kurt Angle versus The Big Show in a singles match. The buildup to the match began on September 9, 2004 during {{an episode of}} SmackDown!, where a Lumberjack match (a standard match where non-participating wrestlers prevent contestants from fleeing the ring) was scheduled between Kurt Angle and Eddie Guerrero. The match ended in a no contest when The Big Show marked his return to SmackDown! by interfering in the match, chokeslamming both Angle and Guerrero in the process. The following week, Big Show was given two contracts to choose from; one contract to face Guerrero and one contract to face Angle. Big Show signed the contract with Guerrero's name on it. After signing it, Angle and his associate Luther Reigns, threw Guerrero {{out of the ring}} and offered Big Show a handshake. Big Show, however, <b>tore</b> <b>up</b> Guerrero's contract and signed the one with Angle's name on it to face him at No Mercy.|$|E

5|$|During the 1840s and 1850s, {{a flurry}} of railroad-building {{activity}} led to the completion of four separate railroads converging in Erie. A break of gauge between the the Erie and North East Railroad and the Franklin Canal Companyensured that the citizens of Erie profited from the delays necessary to transfer cargo between the lines. When it was proposed in 1853 to standardize the track gauge to allow through traffic, a conflict that {{became known as the}} Erie Gauge War ensued. The residents of Erie, who saw it as an affront to their desire that the city become a major lake port, dismantled railroad bridges and <b>tore</b> <b>up</b> railroad tracks in the city in an effort to prevent the impending standardization. As part of the dispute's settlement, both railroads provided financial support for the construction of the Erie and Pittsburgh and Sunbury and Erie railroads. The Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad acquired the Franklin Canal Company in 1854, and the Erie and North East was merged with the Buffalo and State Line to form the Buffalo and Erie Railroad a few years later. The Sunbury and Erie was renamed the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad in 1861. The Pennsylvania Railroad soon acquired the Sunbury and Erie through a 999-year lease and funded completion of the line by 1864.|$|E

25|$|Seven years passed; {{pieces of}} the bridge's eastern {{approach}} viaduct over Poughkeepsie began falling onto U.S. Route 9 below, damaging passing vehicles. In response, the city sued Conrail and forced it to spend $300,000 in 1983 to remove the decking over the superstructure. Conrail then sought {{to dispose of the}} unused bridge and eventually abandoned and <b>tore</b> <b>up</b> its Maybrook Line between Hopewell Junction and Maybrook, New York in 1983–1984.|$|E
25|$|In the {{judgement}} of one urban historian, 'Johnson was {{a superb}} municipal technician. He grasped {{not only the}} ethics but the mathematics of government'. The new administration paved {{hundreds of miles of}} streets and expanded the city's park system, building a large number of playgrounds, ball fields and other facilities. To popular acclaim, the mayor <b>tore</b> <b>up</b> all the 'Keep off the Grass' signs in the city parks, a symbol of his belief in changing parklands' role from passive to active recreation.|$|E

The cyclone which was also caught on tape, <b>tore</b> <b>up</b> {{the roof of a}} car {{dealership}} and additional scattered damage. No injuries or deaths were reported during the tornado event. The area was hit with extensive severe weather {{over the past few days}} which included torrential rains that caused significant flooding across the region as well as hail and wind.
