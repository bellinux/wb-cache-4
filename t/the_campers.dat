5|$|A storm system {{moved to}} the {{northern}} and central Great Plains region during the day, as strong winds helped push a moist air mass northward ahead of the system. Thunderstorms developed during the afternoon ahead of a cold front from southeast South Dakota into central Kansas. Strong winds along with instability in the atmosphere created favorable conditions for supercell development {{with the potential to}} produce strong tornadoes. At approximately 6:35 pm CDT (2335 UTC) a tornado hit the Little Sioux Scout Ranch in Little Sioux, Iowa, killing four Boy Scouts after a chimney collapsed on them and injuring 48others. The camp received a tornado warning 12minutes before it struck. There were 93campers and 25staff members at the camp. <b>The</b> <b>campers</b> were between 13and 18 years old and were attending a leadership training camp. The tornado was rated EF3on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the power system model description and sample studies for extensible surface mobility systems on the Moon and Mars. The mathematical model of power systems for planetary vehicles {{was developed in}} order to estimate power system configuration with given mission parameters and vehicle specifications. The state-of-art power source technologies for space application were used for constructing the model; batteries, fuel cells, and photovoltaic systems were considered in this paper. The Sequential Quadratic Programming method was used to find the optimal power system configurations based {{on the concept of}} a previous MIT study. Several case studies on the Moon and Mars were carried out to show the usefulness of the model and to recommend power system configurations for 7 -day off-base exploration missions on the Moon and Mars. For the lunar mission, photovoltaic and fuel cell hybrid power systems were suggested. In addition, vehicles with photovoltaic/fuel cell hybrid systems could be operated without recharging when they were driving in shadowed regions. For the Mars mission, both fuel cell single power systems and photovoltaic/fuel cell hybrid systems were acceptable for short missions of only a few days. However, if long, sustainable missions were considered, photovoltaic/fuel cell hybrid systems were required.

25|$|Moses {{canceled}} 625 camping leases in March 1934 so {{the beach}} {{could be built}} on the land. Most of <b>the</b> <b>campers</b> were connected to the Tammany Hall political structure that had ruled the city at one point. Campers protested to the mayor, but to no avail. Campers subsequently {{filed a lawsuit against}} the city, which concerned Moses's right to cancel the leases. The courts ruled in favor of the city in May 1934, and the site was cleared of campers in June. To make the beach longer and more perfectly crescent-shaped, Moses decided that Hunter Island and the Twin Islands be connected to Rodman's Neck by filling in most of LeRoy's Bay. The deteriorated Hunter Mansion was demolished with the construction of the beach. Embury also designed a bathhouse pavilion for Orchard Beach.|$|E

Prisoners of Fortune: A Tale of the Massachusetts Bay Colony (Boston: L.C. Page, 1924) was actually a pirate story with Massachusetts as only one location.|$|R
50|$|The {{equipment}} used in camping varies with by intended activity. For instance, in survival camping the equipment consists of small items {{which have the}} purpose of helping <b>the</b> <b>camper</b> in providing food, heat and safety. The {{equipment used}} {{in this type of}} camping must be lightweight and it is restricted to the mandatory items. Other types of camping such as winter camping involve having specially designed equipment in terms of tents or clothing which is strong enough to protect <b>the</b> <b>camper's</b> body from <b>the</b> wind and cold.|$|R

Campers live together in tents at the US camps, and in rooms at the European camp. Bunking assignments are changed every two weeks, so that each student shares accommodations with 16 different young people {{over the course of a}} summer, during the course of which he or she is exposed to many different cultures and individuals.

25|$|Beside {{the danger}} of people {{receiving}} burns from the fire or embers, campfires may spread into a larger fire. A campfire may burn {{out of control in}} two basic ways: on the ground or in the trees. Dead leaves or pine needles on the ground may ignite from direct contact with burning wood, or from thermal radiation. If a root, particularly a dead one, is exposed to fire, it may smoulder underground and ignite the parent tree long after the original fire is doused and <b>the</b> <b>campers</b> have left the area. Alternatively, airborne embers (or their smaller kin, sparks) may ignite dead material in overhanging branches. This latter threat is less likely, but a fire in a branch is extremely difficult to put out without firefighting equipment, and may spread more quickly than a ground fire.|$|E
25|$|Spike Dixon (Jeffrey Holland) Camp Comic – Spike {{was born}} on 12 September (year unknown) and brought up in Edgbaston with his {{childhood}} sweetheart Brenda, {{the daughter of the}} local butcher. After leaving school he gained a good position in the Income Tax office, but resigned in 1959 and joined the entertainment staff at Maplins. It is not known how long he had known Ted, but they were already well-acquainted by the time they travelled on the train to the camp and it was suggested that it was Ted who got Spike the job. Spike shared a chalet with Ted, and there were many humorous scenes between the pair in their chalet, such as Spike being kept awake by Ted's snoring. Spike often tried to branch out into his own style of comedy, designing and making his own costumes and funny sequences. These received mixed reactions from <b>the</b> <b>campers,</b> but Ted criticised almost all of them. Spike was a very honest and law-abiding man, and was {{the only member of the}} entertainment staff who didn't run his own scheme to scam <b>the</b> <b>campers</b> for money. Although he was loyal to Ted and willing to turn a blind-eye to his schemes, he was often shocked at the lengths Ted would go to in order to make money. Spike had to make an impossible choice between his job and the woman he loved during the 1959 season, when his girlfriend, Brenda, said she would marry him only if he gave up his job and went to work for her father's business. He chose his job and ended their relationship. During the 1960 season he became involved with April, one of the new Yellowcoats. At the same time, Spike also fell in love with Gladys, but this never amounted to anything. He continued his relationship with April, and she wanted him to leave Maplins and go back to the tax office so they could get married and have a steady income. As with Brenda, he again decided against this in favour of show business. Spike's immediate intentions after the 1960 season were left unknown, though he revealed he was going to join Ted over Christmas playing a Chinese policeman in a pantomime. It was also implied that he had resumed his affair with April.|$|E
