40|$|The {{use of the}} British Journal of Radiology (BJR) (supplement 17) <b>tables</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalent</b> square {{fields for}} dose {{calculations}} is widespread. A revised version of the supplement was published recently, with a more elaborate discussion, but without changes in data given in these tables (Br. J. Radiol. suppl 25). The tables were generated for use in dose calculations, with relative beam data such as PDD, BSF, PSF, all with as the reference depth. However, the current philosophy in dose calculational methods is based on quantities defined at a reference depth,, on a separation of phantom and head scatter, and {{on the use of}} the relative depth - dose or tissue - phantom ratios normalized at. By using these quantities as a starting point, problems at shallow depths related to the influence of contaminating electrons in the beam can be eliminated. Recently, a comprehensive set of phantom scatter factor data with has been published for a set of square field sizes and a wide range of photon beam energies, showing that phantom scatter is a smoothly varying function of field size and quality index. It is not a priori evident that the conventional concept <b>of</b> <b>equivalent</b> squares for rectangular fields is also fully applicable for phantom scatter factors and phantom scatter related quantities at a depth of 10 cm. It was questioned whether or not new <b>tables</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalent</b> square fields are needed for this purpose. In this paper, new tables have been constructed for four photon beam energies in the range of Co- 60 to 25 MV (quality index from 0. 572 to 0. 783). The small differences between the outcome <b>of</b> these new <b>tables</b> allowed the construction <b>of</b> one averaged <b>table</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalent</b> square fields. Phantom scatter factors were calculated for rectangular fields based on the use <b>of</b> the BJR <b>table</b> and {{on the use of the}} newly constructed tables and the differences were quantified. For Co- 60 no improvements could be shown when using the new averaged table, but for beam energies of 6 to 10 MV small improvements of the order of 0. 5 to 1. 0 % were found. For a higher beam energy of 25 MV the improvement is smaller. Deviations resulting from the BJR table are within the limits of accuracy as stated by the authors. Therefore, for clinical use, the continued use <b>of</b> the BJR <b>table</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalent</b> squares for phantom scatter factors and phantom scatter related quantities of rectangular fields is justified, irrespective of photon beam energy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. | When {{analyzing}} any wavelength region, stellar spectroscopists {{must deal}} with the multitude of weak lines which depress the true continuum and thus form the pseudocontinuum. Calculating the eect of these lines, known collectively as the haze, " under conventional synthetic spectrum analysis is CPU intensive; an excessive amount of time is often spent calculating the opacity proles of lines which are too weak to have even a cumulative eect on the line haze. We have developed a method of identifying and eliminating these " lines from synthetic spectrum computations. We treat the line opacity as a perturbation to the continuum opacity and generate <b>tables</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalent</b> width coecients which are {{a function of the}} model atmosphere, species, excitation potential, and wavelength region. Through interpolation <b>of</b> these <b>tables</b> and knowledge <b>of</b> the gf value for each line, we rapidly and accurately calculate the <b>equivalent</b> width <b>of</b> any line on the linear part of the curve of growth. We then determine the cumulative line blocking as a function <b>of</b> <b>equivalent</b> width. Through the use of this function and a specied line-blocking error, we eliminate from further consideration all lines having little or no eect on the pseudocontinuum. The {{reduction in the number of}} lines used in the spectrum synthesis results in a signicant savings in computation time. We present the method for 314 000 atomic and molecular lines in the 864 − 878 nm wavelength region, eective temperatures of 4000 − 6000 K, log g of 1. 5 − 4. 5 (cgs units), and solar abundances...|$|R

40|$|Issues: Differences in type, structure, {{quality of}} health care systems and {{availability}} of resources influence reporting systems. In most countries, individual systems {{have a long history}} of usage that might preclude adoption of a uniform terminology worldwide. Consensus Position: It is desirable but unrealistic at this time to aim for a unified terminology worldwide. It should be the stated objective of the International Academy of Cytology to serve as an umbrella organization for various terminologies and enhance mutual understanding and cooperation. Translation <b>tables</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalent</b> terms have been created to allow increased communication. Consensus has been achieved in defining essential elements required of any terminology system: (1) the report must be text based: numerical Papanicolaou class designations alone are inadequate; (2) an assessment of the adequacy of the sample should be included; and (3) the diagnosis must address the primary purpose of cervical cytology: to indicate the presence or absence of epithelial abnormalities. Incorporating additional elements within a terminology system may be more or less appropriate, depending on the setting in which the system is used. Ongoing Issues: Despite the cited problems in adopting a uniform terminology worldwide, a single system would have many advantages in terms of communication and research and may be a long-term goal worth pursuing. Countries are invited to present their individual national terminology systems and participate in an ongoing dialogue, critically evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of all systems. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of atoms was the law of definite proportions proposed by him in 1792. Richter found that the ratio by weight of the compounds consumed in a chemical reaction was always the same.

From his data, Ernst Gottfried Fischer calculated in 1802 the first <b>table</b> <b>of</b> chemical <b>equivalents,</b> taking sulphuric acid as the standard with the figure 1000. When Joseph Proust reported his work on the constant composition of chemical compounds, the time was ripe for the reinvention of an atomic theory.

40|$|This manual {{describes}} {{the operations of}} the Extended Malaria Control Program which utilizes residual DDT spraying of homes as a method of malaria control. The Extended Program, initiated by the Office of Malaria Control in War Areas, is now being administered by its successor, the Communicable Disease Center of the U. S. Public Health Service. DDT insecticide used as a residual spray in houses is a new weapon of attack against an old enemy [...] MALARIA. When solutions or emulsions of DDT are sprayed on walls and ceilings, an almost invisible residual deposit of DDT crystals is left on the surface. Malaria mosquitoes and other insects which come in contact with these crystals are poisoned. They die later if they have received a sufficient exposure. This method of killing insects is especially valuable in malaria control activities because mosquitoes inside houses are the ones which are most likely to bite malaria sufferers and thus become infected. These infected mosquitoes have ample opportunity to rest on treated surfaces in houses sprayed with DDT and be killed before they can spread the disease to uninfected persons. This is the basic principle of malaria control through residual spraying. DDT residual spraying is a new insecticidal technique. Before it could be put to extensive use in malaria control programs, it has been necessary to develop new formulas, make changes in spraying equipment, and devise new methods of spraying. This handbook supplies detailed information about formulas used for concentrates and spray mixtures, latest spraying methods, care and use of equipment, and safe practices in handling DDT in U. S. P. H. S. malaria control operations. Suggestions for dealing with the public are also given. The handbook is intended for use by project supervisors and as an aid in training spraying crews. Men in the field who use this handbook are encouraged to send in suggestions and criticisms. These will be helpful in compiling future editions.
