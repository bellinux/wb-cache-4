5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain {{what he or she}} wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Maryland Senate {{are elected}} every four years, in off-year {{elections}} {{in the middle of}} terms for Presidents of the United States. Party nominations are determined by primary elections. The general election for Senate seats and all other state and federal {{elections in the}} normal cycle is held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Should a Senate seat become vacant {{in the middle of a}} term, because of death, illness, incapacitation, disqualification, resignation, or expulsion of a member of the Senate, that seat is filled by appointment. The Central Committee of the previous Senator's party in the county or counties in which the Senate district lies makes a recommendation to the Governor on whom to appoint to the seat. Within fifteen days of the Central Committee's recommendation being selected, the Governor must appoint <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> the vacant seat.|$|E
5|$|Rights of {{a person}} arrested under {{ordinary}} circumstances is laid down in {{the right to life}} and personal liberty. No one can be arrested without being told the grounds for his arrest. If arrested, the person has the right to defend himself by a lawyer of his choice. Also an arrested citizen has to be brought before the nearest magistrate within 24 hours. The rights {{of a person}} arrested under ordinary circumstances are not available to an enemy alien. They are also not available to persons detained under the Preventive Detention Act. Under preventive detention, the government can imprison a person for a maximum of three months. It means that if the government feels that a person being at liberty can be a threat to the law and order or to the unity and integrity of the nation, it can detain or arrest <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> prevent him from doing this possible harm. After three months such a case is brought before an advisory board for review.|$|E
40|$|Recent theorizing {{suggests}} {{that exposure to}} sophisticated or behaviorally complex messages (i. e., messages that reflect a concern with multiple goals) may enhance the cognitive development of message recipients. Reasoning <b>that</b> <b>persons</b> attempt <b>to</b> accommodate their cognitive structuring of an environment {{to the level of}} complexity in that environment, it was hypothesized <b>that</b> <b>persons</b> exposed <b>to</b> behaviorally complex messages would form more differentiated impressions of the message source than would <b>persons</b> exposed <b>to</b> less complex messages...|$|R

50|$|For example, if a <b>person</b> wants <b>to</b> buy a house, <b>that</b> <b>person</b> needs <b>to</b> {{qualify for}} a mortgage. If <b>that</b> <b>person</b> {{explains}} <b>to</b> the mortgage broker that he has $50,000.00 cash available for the down payment toward purchasing the house, the broker will not go ahead and approve the mortgage, even though the quoted amount would be fully satisfactory. What the mortgage broker needs is a more objective argument that would reassure the issuer that the party asking for the mortgage does indeed have enough money for the down payment.|$|R
5|$|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, {{the last}} {{original}} novel in the series, begins directly {{after the events}} of the sixth book. Lord Voldemort has completed his ascension to power and gained control of the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron and Hermione drop out of school so that they can find and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. To ensure their own safety {{as well as that of}} their family and friends, they are forced to isolate themselves. A ghoul pretends to be Ron ill with a contagious disease, Harry and the Dursleys separate, and Hermione wipes her parents' memories. As they search for the Horcruxes, the trio learns details about an ancient prophecy about the Deathly Hallows, three legendary items that when united under one Keeper, would supposedly grant <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> be the Master of Death. Harry discovers his handy Invisibility Cloak to be one of those items, and Voldemort to be searching for another: the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand in history. At the end of the book, Harry and his friends learn about Dumbledore's past, as well as Snape's true motives – he had worked on Dumbledore's behalf since the murder of Harry's mother. Eventually, Snape is killed by Voldemort out of paranoia.|$|E
25|$|In Gaelic law, a 'sanctuary' {{called a}} maighin digona {{surrounded}} each person's dwelling. The maighin digona's size varied {{according to the}} owner's rank. In {{the case of a}} bóaire it stretched as far as he, while sitting at his house, could cast a cnairsech (variously described as a spear or sledgehammer). The owner of a maighin digona could offer its protection to someone fleeing from pursuers, who would then have to bring <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> justice by lawful means.|$|E
25|$|The 1998 {{home run}} race had {{generated}} nearly unbroken positive publicity, but Barry Bonds' {{run for the}} all-time home run record provoked a backlash over steroids, which increase a person's testosterone level and subsequently enable <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> bodybuild with much more ease.

25|$|Bullying {{behaviours}} in {{the workplace}} also exist among colleagues. They can be either the ‘target’ or perpetrator. If workplace bullying happens among the co-workers, witnesses will take sides, either with the target or the perpetrator. Perpetrators always win, because witnesses {{do not want to}} be the next target. This does encourage perpetrators to continue this behaviour. In addition, the sense of the injustice experienced by a target might lead <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> become another perpetrator who bullies other colleagues who have less power than they.|$|E
25|$|This is {{a result}} of Ford v. Wainwright (1986). A Florida inmate on death row appealed his case to the United States Supreme Court, declaring he was not {{competent}} to be executed. The court ruled that a forensic professional must make that evaluation and, if the inmate is found incompetent, provide treatment to aid in his gaining competency so the execution can take place. Providing treatment to an individual to enable <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> become competent to be executed puts mental health professionals in an ethical dilemma.|$|E

On July 28, 2010, Rintarō Okabe and his friend Mayuri Shiina head towards the Radio Kaikan building for a conference, where Rintarō finds a girl named Kurisu Makise lying in a pool of blood. As Rintarō sends a text message about the incident to his friend, Itaru [...] "Daru" [...] Hashida, he experiences a strange phenomenon and the people around him disappear, with no-one else noticing anything had changed. After later running into Kurisu, who is strangely alive and well, and discovering the message he had sent to Itaru had arrived a week before he sent it, Rintarō soon deduces that the 'Mobile Microwave' he and his friends had been developing is, in fact, a time machine capable of sending text messages to the past. He and his friends soon learn that SERN, an organization that has been researching time travel for some time, has actually succeeded in sending humans into the past although they seem to have all resulted in the test subjects' deaths. Rintarō begins experimenting with , which begin to cause major differences in the timeline. Kurisu also manages to create a device to send a person's memories through the microwave, allowing <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> effectively leap into the past.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, {{the team}} {{had come up with}} a core {{gameplay}} mechanic idea based on three groups of forces; drones that would carry a desirable resource, protectors that would guard the drones, and harvesters that would attempt to take the resource from the drones; these would eventually bear out as the Little Sisters, Big Daddies, and splicers in the final game, but {{at the time of the}} concept, there was no set theme. They began working on creating a setting for the game as to be able to pitch the idea to game publishers. A 2002 demonstration version was based on the Unreal Engine 2 for the first Xbox. This demonstration was primarily set aboard a space station overtaken with genetically-mutated monsters; the main character was Carlos Cuello, a [...] "cult deprogrammer"—a person charged with rescuing someone from a cult, and mentally and psychologically readjusting <b>that</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> a normal life. Ken Levine cites an example of what a cult deprogrammer does: [...] " [...] people who hired people to [...] deprogram their daughter who had been in a lesbian relationship. They kidnap her and reprogram her, and it was a really dark person, and that was the [...] character that you were." [...] This story would have been more political in nature, with the character hired by a Senator. The team collectively agreed that this game was not what they had set out to make, and were having trouble finding a publisher. They considered ending development, but as news about their efforts to make a spiritual successor to System Shock 2 began to appear in gaming magazines and websites, the team opted to continue development, performing a full revamp the game.|$|E
