5000|$|The Gibson Victory was an {{electric}} guitar produced by Gibson Guitars from 1981 until 1983 (although some sources say production lasted until 1984). [...] During the late 1970s and early 1980s, musicians watched Eddie Van Halen play his Frankenstrat and questioned and rethought everything about their instruments. They insisted on engineering advances allowing more speed and playability of skyscraping leads and rock crushing shred. The master luthiers in Kalamazoo responded to these demanding guitarists by designing the Victory. The Victory, a superstrat, was {{radical departure from}} Gibson's image as an old-fashioned guitar maker. MV stood for Multi-Voice. X stood for ten They were created by the Gibson research and development team in Kalamazoo, MI, with the body work by Chuck Burge, and the multi-voice electronics by Tim Shaw. The Victory MV's were available with an optional / special order Kahler Tremolo System. The Victory MV's had a three-point top-adjust [...] "tune-o-matic" [...] bridge designed by  Rendal Wall and patent granted in June 1982. The three post holes in the underside allow {{either side of the}} bridge unit to be moved forwards or backwards for intonation of ultra light to extremely heavy string gauges, and twelve interchangeable individually-adjustable saddles, six standard nylon saddles and 6 optional brass saddles to set the fine intonation and affect tone. The Victory MV's came with a series of specially designed Humbucker Pickups carefully made one at a time on the “center focused” KZ/LP115 PAF Pickup Winder, with high sensitivity and unique tonal signature with fewer turns of wire compared to high production winding machines that produce more scatter and a wider magnetic aperture, Each pickup across the range was different, and specifically designed for the role it was assigned. The location of the Pickups were carefully calculated to provide full frequency response and minimize dead spots by avoidance of string nodal points. Humbucker pickups are inherently low noise because the interference is significantly reduced via phase cancellation, however the Victory MV’s had additional shielding connected to ground with the use of special electrically conductive black paint in the routed out area under the pickguard. Truly silent when it should be. The coil <b>tap</b> <b>switch</b> in the up position is humbucker; in the down position is single coil. Gibson had well established business agreements for over 100 years with the best wood suppliers in the world and Gibson Luthiers had first pick to craft the Victory MV's. The availability of premium old growth wood with tight grain was better in the 1980s than it is today because of new laws and limited natural resources. The Victory MV's body and tri-laminated quartersawn neck was crafted from solid eastern hard rock maple, with a Janka Hardness ranking of 1450 pound-force, a crushing strength of 7,830 pound-force per square inch , and a tensile elasticity modulus of 1,830,000 pound-force per square inch, eastern hard rock maple is extremely hard, dense, and stiff, producing earthquaking sustain. [...] The tri-laminate opposing wood grain neck design strengthened the overall neck and gave more tuning stabilization. Evidence shows that wood improves with age, the polymerization of sap over decades, once the wood is removed from the living tree crystalizes. Aged wood also loses its ability to absorb moisture, causing the wood to become more stiff and stable as it ages… the perfect recipe for a straight, high quality guitar neck, level fret board, and great sound. The Victory MV's Set-in neck [...] and silky smooth rock-hard quartersawn Madagascan ebony fret board required better tools, more time, accuracy, attention to detail, and skill to craft, but produces a warmer fuller tone and transfers resonant energy freely and immediately due to the tight permanent coupling, and facilitates ripples of vibrational energy that round out and thicken the sound, in comparison to buzzy guitars with removable screw-on necks having a metal plate and adjustment shims. The chamfered cutaway offers musicians with large hands better access to play in the top frets. The fourteen degree pitch headstock shape and tuning machine alignment allows for a perfectly straight pull on the strings and optimum string down pressure. The Gibson Victory MV's are not recommended for the weak, these sledge axes weigh a solid nine pounds but are perfectly balanced both on the strap or on the knee, Luthiers know guitars with more mass and density have more brilliance and sustain. in fact some older Gibson models weighed as much as twelve pounds. According to Gibson, Victory MV’s were only produced in Candy Apple Red, Antique Cherry Sunburst, & Twilight Blue. However sometimes a retailer who did a lot of business with Gibson would be able to ask for a small number of guitars with a special finish. Mention has been made of Roy Orbison's special order black Victory MVX. [...] The Victory MV's came standard with a rugged black Gibson branded [...] "8170" [...] dual lock and key padded hard case with internal storage box. Decode the serial number {{on the back of the}} headstock to determine where your Victory was made and the date of it's manufacture.|$|E

30|$|This section {{describes}} how monitoring {{the safety of}} the state of the physical system can improve field station security. Section “Threat model and attack scenario” discusses the threat model and attack scenarios. Section “Interlocks” applies monitoring to identify attacks on the system’s interlocks, and section “Transformer tap switch” applies them to a transformer <b>tap</b> <b>switch.</b> Then, section “Advantages of monitoring in a simulation testbed” lists the advantages of using the proposed testbed.|$|E
30|$|In {{the initial}} attack {{scenario}} an attacker attempts to disconnect power lines {{controlled by the}} RTU 3 (cf. Fig.  4 b), one by one. That RTU initially does not perform any of the safety checks as defined in Table  3, i.e., it directly executes the received command. Then the attack scenario is changed, such that the attacker attempts to change the <b>tap</b> <b>switch</b> controlled by RTU 1 (cf. Fig.  4 b) to an unsafe position.|$|E
30|$|Also the {{real-time}} {{capabilities of}} the proposed approach can be evaluated for the presented test cases. The first investigated scenario, i.e., monitoring the interlocks, focused on 4 elements in the switch vector describing {{part of the system}} state, and on the sensor measurements on the 4 connected power lines. The second scenario investigated the transformer <b>tap</b> <b>switch</b> position vector with a single element and the sensor readings of two power lines on the primary and secondary side of the transformer. In these scenarios, calculating the resulting system state and the policy checking within Bro caused message delays of only 0.002 ms on average.|$|E
5000|$|Where {{there is}} more than one pickup, a pickup {{selector}} switch is usually present. These typically select or combine the outputs of two or more pickups, so that two-pickup guitars have three-way switches, and three-pickup guitars have five-way switches (a Gibson Les Paul three-pickup Black Beauty has a three-position toggle switch which configures bridge, bridge and middle in middle position and neck pickups). Further circuitry sometimes combines pickups in different ways. For instance, phase switching places one pickup out of phase with the other(s), leading to a [...] "honky", [...] "nasal", or [...] "funky" [...] sound. Individual pickups can also have their timbre altered by <b>switches,</b> typically coil <b>tap</b> <b>switches</b> that effectively short-circuit some of a dual-coil pickup's windings to produce a tone similar to a single-coil pickup (usually done with push-pull volume knobs).|$|R

30|$|The system {{state can}} change upon {{receiving}} any new information, e.g., {{information from the}} sensors with different voltage readings result in an updated state. Different power values of the sources or loads also update the state. Moreover, a command to open or close any of the switches, or changing the <b>tap</b> <b>switch</b> position brings the system to another state. For constant power sources and loads, for now, only two types of events are considered: (i) readings, and (ii) commands. Readings update the state to a new state T′=(S′,F′,M′,P′,T′), whereas a command {{will result in a}} new state T′ with an updated vector S′, collecting the states of the switches, or/and new vector of transformer states T′.|$|E
30|$|Transformers connect {{parts of}} the power system that operate at {{different}} voltage levels. A transformer Ti for i ∈{ 1,..., |T|} has the following properties: transformation rate Ti.r, which defines the voltage ratio (e.g., the ratio 1000 : 1 transforms voltage from 400 kV to 400 V), and the transformer tap position Ti.p. The position of the <b>tap</b> <b>switch</b> of a Medium to Low Voltage transformer has to be chosen such that the secondary voltage, that is delivered to the customers, equals 230 V. The measurements are not taken directly on the windings of the transformer, but on the incoming and outgoing lines, which results in an accurate approximation. All properties of the transformers are listed in Table  1.|$|E
30|$|The main safety {{requirement}} that is tested when changing the <b>tap</b> <b>switch</b> position is the voltage {{value on the}} secondary windings of the transformer. The safety requirement defined in Table  3 defines that the voltage has to be equal to the nominal value ± 10 %. This is defined for the Low Voltage areas (CENELEC 1988), however, in the proposed approach {{it is also possible}} to perform the same check for Medium Voltage, like proposed in Isozaki et al. (2014). The implementation of the monitoring tool on RTU 1 that controls the transformer needs to be done similarly like shown in section “Implementation of the interlocks” for interlocks (and is not shown here in detail). In the following, only the outcome of the performed tests are shown.|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies on}} voltage {{stability}} analysis of electric systems with high photovoltaic (PV) penetration {{have been conducted}} at a power-transmission level, but very few have focused on small-area networks of low voltage. As a distribution system has its special characteristicshigh R/X ratio, long <b>tap</b> <b>switching</b> delay, small PV units, and so onPV integration impacts {{also need to be}} investigated thoroughly at a distribution level. In this paper, the IEEE 13 bus system has been modified and extended to explore network stability impacts of variable PV generation, and the results show that a voltage stability issue with PV integration does exist in distribution networks. Simulation comparisons demonstrate that distribution networks are traditionally designed for heavily loaded situations exclusive of PVs, but they can still operate under low PV penetration levels without cloud-induced voltage-stability problems. It is also demonstrated that voltage instability can effectively be solved by PV inverter reactive power support if this scheme is allowed by the standards in the near future...|$|R

50|$|Some arcing is unavoidable, {{and both}} the tap changer oil and the switch {{contacts}} will slowly deteriorate with use. To prevent contamination of the tank oil and facilitate maintenance operations, the diverter switch usually operates in a separate compartment from the main transformer tank, and often the <b>tap</b> selector <b>switches</b> will {{be located in the}} compartment as well. All of the winding taps will then be routed into the tap changer compartment through a terminal array.|$|R
30|$|The {{previous}} scenario was {{analyzing the}} situation of an RTU controlling a bus operating at a Medium Voltage level. The following scenario monitors an RTU that controls different voltage levels, namely High and Medium Voltage. This is done via so-called tap switches; by changing their setting, the transformer changes {{the ratio of the}} voltage values on its primary and secondary side. This ratio change results in changing the value of the secondary voltage, while the voltage on the primary side remains the same. The transformer marked in Fig.  4 a connects the High and Medium Voltage levels and contains a controllable <b>tap</b> <b>switch.</b> The operator can send commands from the control room in order to change the value of the voltage on the secondary side of the transformer.|$|E
30|$|This paper also {{presents}} {{an approach to}} implement policies depending on the system state, using the Bro network intrusion detection system. Knowing the system physical constraints and safety requirements, such as the interlocks, the proposed detection mechanism is configured and updated in order to reject commands that can bring the physical system to an unsafe state. Even though the rules are static, {{the outcome of a}} command at a particular moment in time depends on {{the current state of the}} physical system. For various examples, it is presented how such local monitoring helps to improve the security of the power distribution field stations, when malicious commands are sent from the control room (insider attacks). This has been illustrated for two different settings, one in the medium voltage area (interlocks) and one between medium and high voltage (<b>tap</b> <b>switch).</b>|$|E
30|$|While the {{previous}} scenario covered all initially safe configurations, this section {{focuses on the}} analysis of the interaction in the testbed between receiving commands and issuing alerts, as presented in Fig.  7. The upper part of Fig.  7 indicates the time when commands are sent by the attacker and the reaction of the monitoring tool to these commands. The events marked with a green pentagon represent alerts issued by Bro upon receiving the command to change the <b>tap</b> <b>switch</b> to a position that would result in a too high secondary voltage. This is a result of implementing the voltage safety requirement (cf. Table  3) upon receiving a new command (cf. the right-side loop of Fig.  2). Note that Fig.  2 indicates that the command that may bring the system to an unsafe state should be discarded. Here, only an alert was given in order to analyze the further behavior of the system.|$|E

50|$|A {{mechanical}} {{tap changer}} physically makes the new connection before releasing the old using multiple <b>tap</b> selector <b>switches</b> but avoids creating high circulating currents {{by using a}} diverter switch to temporarily place a large diverter impedance in series with the short-circuited turns. This technique overcomes the problems with open or short circuit taps. In a resistance type tap changer, the changeover must be made rapidly to avoid overheating of the diverter. A reactance type tap changer uses a dedicated preventive autotransformer winding to function as the diverter impedance, and a reactance type tap changer is usually designed to sustain off-tap loading indefinitely.|$|R
40|$|Transformer is {{the most}} {{important}} unit in an electrical distribution network. All transformers are subjected to various tests at the manufacturer&rsquo;s test laboratory before despatch to the destination of erection. Measurement of turn&rsquo;s ratio is one of the routine tests which each transformer has to undergo. &nbsp; In the case of an ordinary winding resistance meter, we can measure the winding resistance and the contact resistance together. It is not possible to measure the contact resistance separately by this meter.

30|$|Regarding {{the first}} contribution, this paper {{presents}} {{the integration of the}} simulation of the physical power distribution with a discrete-event simulation of the Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) used for control purposes. Moreover, this paper shows how the previously proposed local monitoring approach can improve the security of the distributed field stations at different voltage levels. For so-called interlocks, i.e., mutually dependent states of system elements, the proposed monitoring prevents the execution of 33.3 % of all commands. Without the proposed approach in place, those commands would have resulted in an unsafe state of the power distribution. The remaining two-thirds of the commands yield a safe state of the power distribution, i.e., all the neighborhoods remain connected to the power grid. Hence, the approach allows the RTU to execute them, even though they might come from an untrusted source. In a second scenario, monitoring is used to identify commands to change the <b>tap</b> <b>switch</b> position of a transformer, which lead the system into an unsafe state. This could either lead to an alert or potentially, to discarding the packet with the malicious command.|$|E
40|$|As Eskom {{continues}} its drive for Electricity-for-All and the electrification of rural areas, there is continuing pressure {{to reduce costs}} {{by the use of}} appropriate technologies and designs. Single Wire Earth Return (SWER) and dual phase LV technologies have been introduced for rural areas supply. Savings have also been made by the selection of appropriate design loads on which to base the network design. In addition to load and household density, overall cost per connection is also affected by the extent of voltage regulation allowed for in feeder design and operation. Rural electrification projects are typically supplied by 11 kV or 22 kV 3 wire overhead distribution systems. The LV (230 V single phase or 400 V three phase) supplies are distributed to individual homes using Aerial Bundle Conductor (ABC) and Airdac service connections. The design of the distribution infrastructure is based on the requirement that the voltages at all LV customer installations stay within ± 10 % of the nominal voltage, in accordance with the regulations of the National Electricity Regulator and NRS 048. The maximum allowable voltage drop in the LV feeders is effectively dictated by the local MV supply voltage and level of boosting that is being performed by the local distribution MV/LV supply transformer, which is equipped with an Off Circuit <b>Tap</b> <b>Switch</b> (OCTS). By providing a “stiff ” MV supply voltage (the incoming MV voltage does not deviate significantly from nominal), the allowable voltage drop in the LV runs can be increased, an...|$|E
40|$|When {{going from}} Delft to Rotterdam by train, or when driving over the highway, or biking through the Dutch landscape, {{did you ever}} look up and wonder about the network of power lines that span our country? The {{electricity}} network, globally on of the largest structures created by mankind, is a complex system consisting of thousands of power transmission lines, power generation stations, transformer substations, and consumption points. Day-in day-out electricity is transmitted from one point to another to enable our modern life. Can you imagine living a whole day with no electricity at all? To ensure efficient and secure operation of power networks, network operators adjust controls in the network to meet certain control objectives. These controls consist of adjusting power generation, changing transformer <b>taps,</b> <b>switching</b> off consumption, etc. Control objectives typically consist of maintaining values of network variables like voltages and frequency at or close to pre-specified values. The values of these network variables can be manipulated by changing the flows of power over the network. Network operators change the flow of power over the network by using the controls available. Although controlling the flows {{has always been a}} challenging task, the ever growing increase of energy consumption, the changes in the power market, and the increasing appearance of small scale, so-called embedded generation, make the control of power networks in the future become even more challenging.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades many voltage {{collapse}} incidents have occurred, caused by uncoordinated interactions of local controllers, following a major disturbance in {{electric power system}} operating {{closer and closer to}} their safety limits. Currently most voltage control schemes are rule-based and only rely on local measurements. However the availability of wide-area phasor measurements (WAMS/PMU) suggests that the risk of voltage collapse could be reduced by coordinating control actions in neighboring control regions of the network. This paper shows how distributed model predictive control (MPC) can be used in order to design such a coordinating controller. Local control agents carry out an on-line optimization by comparing the plant behavior over a finite window in time, for different possible switching sequences of the local tap changing transformer (LTC). The evolution of the plant behavior is obtained by a fast Modelica simulation of the hybrid systems model, using information on the <b>tap</b> <b>switching</b> sequences that neighboring control regions are planning to implement on their LTCs. Through simulation of a 12 -bus power system this paper shows that the distributed MPC controllers can prevent, or at least postpone, voltage collapse in circumstances where classical uncoordinated controllers fail. The required communication exchange is very limited, making practical applications feasible. However extensions to larger systems will require consideration of modeling abstractions of neighboring control regions, so as to keep the simulation time for each local decision maker short...|$|R
