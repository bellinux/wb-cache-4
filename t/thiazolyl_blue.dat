40|$|This new assay {{procedure}} for diaphorase eliminates problems of high blank rates and nonlinear kinetics as-sociated with other methods. The dye <b>thiazolyl</b> <b>blue</b> tet-razolium bromide is reduced {{in the presence}} of NADH and diaphorase to yield a colored formazan, which has maxi-mum absorbance at 560 nm. AdditionalKeyphrase: enzymatic method “Diaphorase ” is the generic name for a group of enzymes widely used in clinical diagnostic reagents to couple pyridine nucleotide-dependent analyte oxidation to reduction of chromogenic electron acceptors. This allows many different assays to be done with measurements within the visible range of the spectrum, rather than in the ultraviolet. Diaphorase activity is commonly measured spectrophotometrically,with use of various electron acceptors such as 2, 6 -dichlorophe-nolindophenol (DCPIP.) 2 Unfortunately, there are several problems with these techniques, including nonlinearity, high blank rates, and measurement of decreasing ratherthan in-creasing absorbance. Tetrazolium salts have been increasingly applied in recent years, particularly in oxidation-reduction histochemistry (1). Enzymic reduction of tetrazolium salts by microbial diapho-rase has been reported (2). In this communication, we describe a new diaphorase assay procedure based on the reduction of <b>thiazolyl</b> <b>blue</b> tetrazolium bromide (MTT). The method is simple, sensitive, and avoids difficulties {{associated with the use of}} many other electron acceptors. This work has been presented in preliminary form. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: All natural anticancer {{agents are}} {{cytotoxic}} basically and act mainly by the inhibition cell proliferation; {{but they have}} different mechanisms. Two assays, <b>thiazolyl</b> <b>blue</b> [3 - (4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl-terazoliumbromide or MTT] and sulforhodamine B (SRB), are used to assess cell growth. This study aimed to compare measurements between MTT and SRB on the cancer cell lines. Methods: Different concentrations of the bromelain were added to cultured cells including mouse breast cancer (4 T 1), human gastric carcinoma (AGS), and human prostate carcinoma (PC 3) cell lines and incubated at 24 and 48 hours. The growth and proliferation rates of the studied cells were investigated using both MTT and SRB assays after treatment with bromelain. The differences between cells were determined using Kruskal-Wallis and Dunns tests. Findings: Bromelain significantly decreased growth and proliferation rate of 4 T 1, AGS and PC 3 cancer cells, in a concentration-dependent manner at different times, in both MTT and SRB assays. Conclusion: Findings showed that both MTT and SRB assays gained similar data regardless of the cell types.

Os resultados obtidos demonstraram uma menor proporção de células viáveis e um maior grau de lesão da túnica mucosa nos animais do grupo GIR- 3 em relação ao controle (p Many {{methods are}} used to evaluate ischemia reperfusion injury, but the most employed one is the histological study. However, it only demonstrates on mucosal tunic, the index of lesion and morphologic preserved cells, but not the index of viable functional cells, present in the sample. With this purpose, a colorimetric method was used, employing Methyl <b>Thiazolyl</b> <b>Blue</b> (MTT). The experiment was conducted in 30 Wistar male rats, distributed in 3 groups: Group Control (GC), Group ischemia and reperfusion- 1 (GIR- 1) and Group ischemia and reperfusion- 3 (GIR- 3), with 10 animals each. The Groups GIR- 1 and GIR- 3 were submitted to intestinal ischemia for 30 minutes by a false ligature of superior mesenteric artery, and submitted to euthanasia after 1 and 3 days of reperfusion, when material was picked for absorbency and histological procedures. It was observed a smaller proportion of viable cells and a larger degree of mucosal lesion in GIR- 3 group (p< 0. 05), while GC group {{was the one with}} the larger proportion of viable cells and smaller degree of the mucosal injury (p< 0. 05). This way we concluded that MTT is as effective and reliable as the histological study at evaluating alterations produced by intestinal ischemia-reperfusion...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMonocyte {{cells are}} exposed {{to a range of}} {{reactive}} oxygen species (ROS) when they are recruited to a site of inflammation. In this study, we have examined the damage caused to the monocyte-like cell line U 937 by peroxyl radicals and characterised the protective effect of the macrophage synthesised compound 7, 8 -dihydroneopterin. Exposure of U 937 cells to peroxyl radicals, generated by the thermolytic breakdown of 2, 2 ′-azobis(amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), resulted in the loss of cell viability as measured by <b>thiazolyl</b> <b>blue</b> (MTT) reduction, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage. The major form of cellular damage observed was cellular thiol loss and the formation of reactive protein hydroperoxides. Peroxyl radical oxidation of the cells only caused a small increase in cellular lipid oxidation measured. Supplementation of the media with increasing concentrations of 7, 8 -dihydroneopterin significantly reduced the cellular thiol loss and inhibited the formation of the protein hydroperoxides. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed 7, 8 -dihydroneopterin was oxidised by both peroxyl radicals and preformed protein hydroperoxides to predominately 7, 8 -dihydroxanthopterin. The possibility that 7, 8 -dihydroneopterin is a cellular antioxidant protecting macrophage proteins during inflammation is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{differences}} in micro-environment between cancer cells and the normal ones offer {{the possibility to}} develop stimuli-responsive drug-delivery systems for overcoming the drawbacks in the clinical use of anticancer drugs, such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and etc. Hence, we developed a novel endosomal pH-sensitive paclitaxel (PTX) prodrug micelles based on functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) -poly(ε-caprolactone) (mPEG-PCL) diblock polymer with an acid-cleavable acetal (Ace) linkage (mPEG-PCL-Ace-PTX). The mPEG-PCL-Ace-PTX 5 with a high drug content of 23. 5 wt % was self-assembled in phosphate buffer (pH 7. 4, 10 mM) into nanosized micelles with an average diameter of 68. 5 nm. The in vitro release studies demonstrated that mPEG-PCL-Ace-PTX 5 micelles was highly pH-sensitive, in which 16. 8 %, 32. 8 %, and 48. 2 % of parent free PTX was released from mPEG-PCL-Ace-PTX 5 micelles in 48 h at pH 7. 4, 6. 0, and 5. 0, respectively. <b>Thiazolyl</b> <b>Blue</b> Tetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assays suggested that the pH-sensitive PTX prodrug micelles displayed higher therapeutic efficacy against MCF- 7 cells compared with free PTX. Therefore, the PTX prodrug micelles with acetal bond may offer a promising strategy for cancer therapy...|$|E
