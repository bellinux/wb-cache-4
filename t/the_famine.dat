5|$|Caused {{in part by}} a drought, the Russian famine of 1921 was {{the most}} severe that the country had {{experienced}} since that of 1891, resulting in around five million deaths. <b>The</b> <b>famine</b> was exacerbated by government requisitioning, as well as the export of large quantities of Russian grain. To aid <b>the</b> <b>famine</b> victims, the US government established an American Relief Administration to distribute food; Lenin was suspicious of this aid and had it closely monitored. During <b>the</b> <b>famine,</b> Patriarch Tikhon called on Orthodox churches to sell unnecessary items to help feed the starving, an action endorsed by the government. In February 1922 Sovnarkom went further by calling on all valuables belonging to religious institutions to be forcibly appropriated and sold. Tikhon opposed the sale of items used within the Eucharist and many clergy resisted the appropriations, resulting in violence.|$|E

5|$|The second group, plates 48 to 64, {{detail the}} effects of <b>the</b> <b>famine</b> which ravaged Madrid from August 1811 until after Wellington's armies liberated the city in August 1812.

In these plates, Goya's focus is {{directed}} away from the generalised scenes of slaughter of anonymous, unaligned people in unnamed regions of Spain; he turns towards a specific horror unfolding in Madrid. <b>The</b> <b>famine</b> was a result of many factors. For example, French invaders and Spanish guerrillas and bandits blocked paths and roads into the city, hampering the provision of food.|$|E
50|$|A few of <b>the</b> great <b>famines</b> of <b>the</b> late 20th century were: <b>the</b> Biafran <b>famine</b> in <b>the</b> 1960s, <b>the</b> Khmer Rouge-caused <b>famine</b> in Cambodia in the 1970s, <b>the</b> North Korean <b>famine</b> of <b>the</b> 1990s and <b>the</b> Ethiopian <b>famine</b> of 1983-85.|$|R
50|$|Indian {{agriculture}} is {{heavily dependent on}} climate: a favourable southwest summer monsoon is critical in securing water for irrigating crops. Droughts, combined with policy failures, have periodically led to major Indian <b>famines,</b> including <b>the</b> Bengal <b>famine</b> of 1770, <b>the</b> Chalisa <b>famine,</b> <b>the</b> Doji bara <b>famine,</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Famine</b> of 1876-78, and <b>the</b> 1943 Bengal <b>famine.</b> Some commentators have identified British government inaction as contributing factors to <b>the</b> severity of <b>famines</b> during <b>the</b> time India was under British rule. Famine largely ended {{by the start of}} 20th century with <b>the</b> 1943 Bengal <b>famine</b> being an exception related to complications during World War II. <b>The</b> 1883 Indian <b>Famine</b> Codes, transportation improvements and changes following independence have been identified as furthering famine relief. In India, traditionally, agricultural labourers and rural artisans have been the primary victims of <b>famines.</b> In <b>the</b> worst <b>famines,</b> cultivators have also been susceptible.|$|R
50|$|The years around 1620 {{saw another}} period of famine sweep across Europe.

5|$|Although {{the market}} {{continued}} to operate, {{in the immediate}} aftermath of the plague it was at a much reduced level and many stalls were left empty for some years after. <b>The</b> <b>famine</b> of 1369 overwhelmed Norwich's burial grounds, necessitating an expansion of St Peter Mancroft's churchyard. The southernmost rows of stalls in the main marketplace, which had been occupied by drapers and linen merchants, were removed to clear space for an enlarged churchyard. By 1377, the population of Norwich had fallen from at least 20,000 before the outbreak to below 6,000.|$|E

5|$|Famine {{is shaped}} by {{generally}} two theories. The first is FAD, Food Availability Decline. This {{is the result of}} a drought, a war, or some other drastic change to the agricultural system. This is the natural cause for famine. The other theory deals primarily with the population’s ability to access or become entitled to food. In this case, food power makes itself known on a small scale, as opposing political forces in Sudan compete for the votes of the people by instigating or encouraging <b>the</b> <b>famine.</b>|$|E

50|$|Some British citizens, such as William Digby, {{agitated}} {{for policy}} reforms and famine relief, but Lord Lytton, the governing British viceroy in India, opposed such {{changes in the}} belief that they would stimulate shirking by Indian workers. The first, <b>the</b> Bengal <b>famine</b> of 1770, is estimated to have taken around 10 million lives—one-third of Bengal's population at the time. Other notable <b>famines</b> include <b>the</b> Great <b>Famine</b> of 1876-78, in which 6.1 million to 10.3 million people died and <b>the</b> Indian <b>famine</b> of 1899-1900, in which 1.25 to 10 million people died. <b>The</b> <b>famines</b> were ended by the 20th century with the exception of <b>the</b> Bengal <b>famine</b> of 1943 killing an estimated 2.1 million Bengalis during World War II.|$|R
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of <b>the</b> <b>famine,</b> an increase in industrial production and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms.

In 1782, Poynings' Law was repealed, giving Ireland legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since 1495. The British government, however, still retained the right to nominate the government of Ireland without the consent of the Irish parliament.|$|E

5|$|The kingdom {{continued}} to exist. Batu Khan withdrew his entire army {{when he was}} informed {{of the death of}} the Great Khan Ögödei in March 1242. Nevertheless, the invasion and <b>the</b> <b>famine</b> that followed it had catastrophic demographic consequences. At least 15percent of the population died or disappeared. Transcontinental trading routes disintegrated, causing the decline of Bács (Bač, Serbia), Ungvár (Uzhhorod, Ukraine) and other traditional centers of commerce. Local Muslim communities also disappeared, indicating they had suffered especially heavy losses during the invasion.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of Ireland rose rapidly from the 16th century until the mid-19th century, interrupted briefly by <b>the</b> <b>Famine</b> of 1740-41, which killed roughly two fifths of the island's population. The population rebounded and multiplied {{over the next}} century, but another devastating famine in the 1840s caused one million deaths and forced over one million more to emigrate in its immediate wake. Over the following century the population was reduced by over half, {{at a time when}} the general trend in European countries was for populations to rise by an average of three-fold.|$|E
5|$|The {{so-called}} 'famine roads' {{were not}} built in Lurgan {{to the same}} extent as the rest of Ireland, although land owners also provided outdoor relief by employing labourers to lower hills and repair existing road.

The Lurgan workhouse was situated in the grounds of what is now Lurgan Hospital and a commemorative mural can be seen along the adjacent Tandragee Road.|$|E
5|$|Barbara Bell, another scholar, {{believes}} that an economic catastrophe {{such as a}} famine or a long-lasting drought affected Egypt. To better {{address the problem of}} feeding the Egyptian population, Nynetjer split the realm into two and his successors founded two independent realms, perhaps with intent to reunite after <b>the</b> <b>famine.</b> Bell points to the inscriptions of the Palermo stone, where, in her opinion, the records of the annual Nile floods show constantly low levels during this period. Bell's theory is refuted today by Egyptologists such as Stephan Seidlmayer, who asserts her calculations were incorrect. Seidlmayer has shown that the annual Nile floods were at usual levels at Nynetjer's time up to the period of the Old Kingdom. Bell overlooked that the heights of the Nile floods in the Palermo stone inscription take into account the measurements of the nilometers around Memphis, but not elsewhere along the river. A state-wide drought was unlikely.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> next {{recorded}} <b>famine</b> in Czech lands was <b>the</b> Great <b>Famine,</b> {{which lasted}} from 1770 until 1771. The cause of <b>the</b> Great <b>Famine</b> was {{a disease of}} grain monoculture and heavy rains. <b>The</b> Great <b>Famine</b> killed twelve percent of the Czech lands’ population, up to 500,000 inhabitants, and radicalized countrysides, which led to peasant uprisings. This famine ended when Czech lands imported and began producing potatoes. <b>The</b> last <b>famine</b> in Czech lands was in Czech Silesia in 1847. This famine {{was caused by a}} potato disease and led to the deaths of over 20,000 people.|$|R

5|$|Edward's {{difficulties}} were {{exacerbated by}} prolonged problems in English agriculture, {{part of a}} wider phenomenon in northern Europe known as the Great Famine. It began with torrential rains in late 1314, followed by a very cold winter and heavy rains the following spring that killed many sheep and cattle. The bad weather continued, almost unabated, into 1321, resulting {{in a string of}} bad harvests. Revenues from the exports of wool plummeted and the price of food rose, despite attempts by Edward II's government to control prices. Edward called for hoarders to release food, and tried to encourage both internal trade and the importation of grain, but with little success. The requisitioning of provisions for the royal court during <b>the</b> <b>famine</b> years only added to tensions.|$|E
5|$|For example, Sudan’s {{famine in}} the 1980s was {{completely}} intentional, {{and was only}} a pawn for a varied collection of different elites to improve their political and economic statuses. These political parties weren’t the only beneficiaries, though. Merchants were also known to hoard grain and buy livestock at inappropriately low prices when the famines shifted the terms of trade. Western Sudanese merchants during <b>the</b> <b>famine</b> of 1987 were described as heartless because they refused to sell grain to needy villages in Darfur at reasonable prices. Ergo, the Sudanese Famine was another example of food power in which food was and used as a policy, and which completely ignored {{the needs of the}} people and fostered the political and power-hungry intentions of opposite warring forces in the country.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Kheda {{was hit by}} {{floods and}} famine and the {{peasantry}} was demanding relief from taxes. Gandhi moved his headquarters to Nadiad, organising scores of supporters and fresh volunteers from the region, the most notable being Vallabhbhai Patel. Using non-co-operation as a technique, Gandhi initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue even under the threat of confiscation of land. A social boycott of mamlatdars and talatdars (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. Gandhi worked hard to win {{public support for the}} agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused but finally in end-May 1918, the Government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until <b>the</b> <b>famine</b> ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.|$|E
40|$|The tale of <b>the</b> Irish <b>Famine,</b> 1845 ¿ 1849, {{following}} {{the outbreak of}} potato late blight, has been told repeatedly, but the parallel story of <b>the</b> Continental <b>Famine,</b> 1845 ¿ 1847, {{has not yet been}} recorded. <b>The</b> Continental <b>Famine</b> was caused by poor harvests of potatoes, due to the same late blight, but also of grain, due to frost, drought, rust, voles, inopportune rains, floods and hailstorms. <b>The</b> Continental <b>Famine</b> was enhanced by hoarding, speculation, and poor governance. Hunger was followed by infectious diseases. The demographic effects of hunger and diseases are difficult to disentangle.

He was finally defeated in 1318 by Edward II's Irish justiciar, Edmund Butler, at the Battle of Faughart, and Edward Bruce's severed head was sent back to the King.

At Kattabomman's court, a British messenger sent by Colonel Ooshington, Tirunelveli's new collector, reports that Pillai {{and his men}} have looted their granaries and killed their men at Srivaikuntam. Pillai justifies his act, saying that he instructed his men {{to do it because}} of <b>the</b> <b>famine</b> conditions prevalent in their kingdom. Ashamed of Pillai's act, Kattabomman accuses him of injustice. Pillai apologises and offers himself as a prisoner to the British, but Kattabomman refuses to hand him over; instead he offers money to the British as compensation for the looted rice. Ooshington does not agree and, with Major Bannerman's and Ettappan's help, incites the neighbouring rulers to attack Kattabomman. Bannerman is placed in charge of the British troops. He and Ettappan plan to attack Panchalankurichi when the people are away attending a festival in Tiruchendur. Kattabomman's spy Sunderalingam, overhears this and informs him; he prepares for battle.|$|E
5|$|The British cavalry {{became aware}} of the ponies in 1804, during the Peninsular War, and used them as pack animals during the conflict; most did not return to Ireland. <b>The</b> <b>famine</b> of 1845–1852 furthered their decline, as farmers who {{previously}} utilised them died or emigrated. In addition, Spanish donkeys were brought to the island to replace the ponies, and when peat declined as a fuel source, pack animals were no longer needed. In the 1850s, farms began to be consolidated, and more machinery and large draft horses were employed, further reducing the number of ponies needed. Consequently, the ponies were left to run feral, mostly ignored and sometimes shot at by locals.|$|E
