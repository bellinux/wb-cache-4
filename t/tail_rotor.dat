5|$|During {{the first}} year of his administration, Jones and five others were {{traveling}} in a state helicopter from Frankfort to Fort Knox when a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> blade snapped, causing the helicopter to crash in Shelby County. The pilot was able to guide the helicopter into a treetop to soften the impact. No one was killed, but Jones suffered a severe back strain and a bruised kidney. The National Transportation Safety Board later determined that the pilot and co-pilot had not properly attached an engine cowling that knocked off the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> blade. Both pilots maintained that they did nothing wrong, and Jones credited them for the survival of the passengers aboard the helicopter.|$|E
5|$|The RN's {{final order}} was for 44 ASW aircraft, {{originally}} designated Merlin HAS.1 but soon changed to Merlin HM1. The first fully operational Merlin was delivered on 17 May 1997, entering service on 2 June 2000. All aircraft were {{delivered by the}} end of 2002, and are operated by four Fleet Air Arm squadrons: 814 NAS, 820 NAS, 824 NAS and 829 NAS, all based at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall. 700 NAS was the Merlin Operational Evaluation Unit from 2000 to 2008. In March 2004, Navy Merlins were temporarily grounded following an incident at RNAS Culdrose in which a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> failed due to a manufacturing defect. An improved <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> was designed and adopted on most AW101s; according to AgustaWestland, the redesigned rotor also significantly reduced associated maintenance.|$|E
5|$|The first anti-submarine {{version for}} the Royal Navy, with Gnome H.1400 engines, a five-bladed <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> a Plessey Type 195 dipping sonar and MEL ARI 5995 search radar in a dorsal radome. The Westland Sea King HAS.1 first flew on 7 May 1969. 56 built, {{many of which}} were {{converted}} to HAS.2.|$|E
5000|$|... 260 coaxial UAV is an {{experimental}} unmanned helicopter developed by Nobel Moral in coaxial layout combined with <b>tail</b> <b>rotors.</b> In addition to combining coaxial <b>rotors</b> with <b>tail</b> <b>rotors,</b> another unique design of this unmanned helicopter {{is that the}} tail section is modular design that can be either a pair of <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> (with one mounted at the {{each side of the}} tail boom), or the <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> can be replaced with a pusher propeller. The developer claims that in comparison to traditional helicopter layout, 260 coaxial UAV design has increased payload by 20% and speed up to 60%. Another version has already been jointly developed with Tianjin University based on the identical pricinciple. Specification: ...|$|R

5|$|Upgraded anti-submarine {{version for}} the Royal Navy, based on Australian Mk 50. More {{powerful}} Gnome H.1400-1 engines, six bladed <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and upgraded avionics (including new Type 2069 dipping sonar), and improved navigation and communications equipment; 21 new build aircraft plus conversions from HAS.1s. Some were later converted for AEW (Airborne Early Warning) duties.|$|E
5|$|As intended, {{it would}} have functioned as a stealth helicopter, {{incorporating}} {{a number of different}} techniques and technologies in order to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS) along with other areas of visibility and detectability. The exterior surfaces of the RAH-66 were faceted and covered with both radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and infrared-suppressant paint; {{as a result of these}} combined measures, the Comanche's RCS was claimed to have been 360 times smaller than that of the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. The acoustic signature of the rotorcraft was also reported to be noticeably lower than comparative helicopters; this reduction had been partially achieved through the adoption of an all-composite five-blade main rotor and pioneering canted <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> assembly.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Boeing {{conceptualized}} an Apache upgrade {{prior to}} the introduction of the U.S. Army's anticipated attack version of the Future Vertical Lift aircraft, forecast to replace the Apache by 2040. The conceptual AH-64F would have greater speed via a new 3,000 shp turboshaft engine from the improved turbine engine program, retractable landing gear, stub wings to offload lift from the main rotor during cruise, and a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> that can articulate 90 degrees to provide forward thrust. In October 2016, the Army revealed they would not pursue another Apache upgrade to focus on funding the FVL; the Army will continue buying the Apache through the 2020s until Boeing's production line ends in 2026, then FVL is slated to come online in 2030.|$|E

50|$|The Safari is a two-seat light {{helicopter}} with {{a bubble}} canopy, a two-bladed main rotor and a skid landing gear. The aircraft structure consists predominantly of welded 4130 chromoly steel tubing. The kit provides the main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotors,</b> rotor hubs, transmission, engine, cockpit and tailboom completed. Builder construction is largely assembly.|$|R
25|$|The second {{aircraft}} was modified {{from the original}} XV-1 {{in an attempt to}} reduce parasitic drag during high-speed forward flight. To achieve this end, the rotor pylon was reduced and the undercarriage was streamlined as well as strengthened. The second XV-1 also featured two small <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> mounted on the outboard side {{at the end of each}} tailboom. These were a result of the hover test flights by Noll who remarked on the lack of yaw authority when using rudders only. The original XV-1 would later be modified with the <b>tail</b> <b>rotors.</b>|$|R
5|$|Jolly Green 67 flew east at first, {{further into}} {{territory}} {{held by the}} North Vietnamese, before it turned southeast for a few kilometers, when a fire {{broke out in the}} left engine. Pieces of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> struck the main rotor, and the aircraft rolled and crashed on its left side, burning ferociously. No rescue beepers were heard. The entire crew was listed as MIA and presumed killed: Capt. Peter Hayden Chapman II (pilot), Capt. John Henry Call III (co-pilot), TSgt. William Roy Pearson, TSgt. Allen J. Avery (para-rescuemen), TSgt. Roy D. Prater (Crew Chief), and Sgt. James Harold Alley (combat photographer). The fire consuming the helicopter was so hot it melted parts of the aircraft and continued to burn for three more days.|$|E
5|$|As they hovered {{above the}} target, however, the first {{helicopter}} experienced a hazardous airflow condition {{known as a}} vortex ring state. This was aggravated by higher than expected air temperature ("a so-called 'hot and high' environment") and the high compound walls, which stopped the rotor downwash from diffusing. The helicopter's tail grazed one of the compound's walls, damaging its <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> and the helicopter rolled onto its side. The pilot quickly buried the aircraft's nose {{to keep it from}} tipping over. None of the SEALs, crew and pilots on the helicopter were seriously injured in the soft crash landing, which ended with it pitched at a 45-degree angle resting against the wall. The other helicopter landed outside the compound and the SEALs scaled the walls to get inside. The SEALs advanced into the house, breaching walls and doors with explosives.|$|E
5|$|The Westland Apache {{experienced}} {{delays in}} entering service due to complications with the modifications made for British service. Prior to the Apache entering service in 2004, several development problems were noted, including {{a lack of}} the ability to securely communicate with other helicopters and a risk of damage to the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and airframe from firing its Hellfire missiles. The problem with using the Hellfire was debris generated by the firing of missiles, both the Hellfire and CRV7 rockets, could strike the body of the aircraft and cause damage; resolving this issue created a delay to training programmes. These problems were corrected prior to entering service, a secure communications suite was installed and Hellfire missiles are routinely fired by Apaches. In 2002, government sources stated that full operational capability was set to be achieved by 2010.|$|E

25|$|The Sikorsky S-76 is an American medium-size {{commercial}} utility helicopter, {{manufactured by}} the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation. The S-76 features twin turboshaft engines, four-bladed main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> and retractable landing gear.|$|R
50|$|While {{conventional}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> {{typically have}} two or four blades, Fenestrons have between eight and eighteen blades. These may have variable angular spacing so that the noise is distributed over different frequencies.|$|R
5|$|Deaths during {{training}} accidents {{make up the}} majority of the SASR's fatalities. The worst accident in the regiment's history occurred on the evening of 12 June 1996 when two S-70-A9 Black Hawk helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment carrying SASR troopers collided during a live-fire counter-terrorism/special-recovery operation exercise at Fire Support Base Barbara in the High Range Training Area near Townsville, Queensland. This activity was part of Exercise Day Rotor 96 and took place {{on the second day of}} the exercise, sometime after 18:30, requiring the pilots to use night vision goggles. Six aircraft had been approaching the target area when, 30 seconds from the landing zone, one of the helicopters veered to the right, clipping the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> of another helicopter. One Black Hawk crashed immediately killing 12 personnel on board, while the other was able to make a crash landing but burst into flames, killing six. Crash survivors, soldiers from the other helicopters and exercise staff risked the flames and exploding ammunition to rescue their comrades and retrieve the bodies of the dead. Fifteen members of the SASR and three from the 5th Aviation Regiment lost their lives in the accident. Fourteen personnel were later officially recognised for their part in the rescue and evacuation operation.|$|E
25|$|The SH09 is a light-medium helicopter, {{powered by}} a single Honeywell HTS900 {{turboshaft}} engine. It uses a shrouded fenestron <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and the main rotor features a five-bladed bearingless hub; the shrouded <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> has a wider diameter and a thinner chord {{in order to increase}} airflow, while design aspects such as a narrow tail boom, swept-back tips on the main rotor blades, and the shrouded <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> purposefully reduce the SH09's noise signature. The HTS900 is capable of providing 1,020-shaft-horsepower, which is reportedly enough to produce high performance levels for the SH09 under hot and high conditions.|$|E
25|$|The UH-1H's dynamic {{components}} include the engine, transmission, rotor mast, main rotor blades, <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> driveshaft, and the 42-degree and 90-degree gearboxes. The transmission is of a planetary type {{and reduces the}} engine's output to 324 rpm at the main rotor. The two-bladed, semi-rigid rotor design, with pre-coned and underslung blades, is a development of early Bell model designs, such as the Bell 47 with which it shares common design features, including a dampened stabilizer bar. The two-bladed system reduces storage space required for the aircraft, but {{at a cost of}} higher vibration levels. The two-bladed design is also responsible for the characteristic 'Huey thump' when the aircraft is in flight, which is particularly evident during descent and in turning flight. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is driven from the main transmission, via the two directional gearboxes which provide a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> speed approximately six times that of the main rotor to increase <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|The SNCASE SE-3110 or Sud-Est SE-3110 was a French {{two seat}} {{experimental}} helicopter with unusual twin, angled <b>tail</b> <b>rotors,</b> first flown in 1950. After brief tests SNCASE decided {{to concentrate on}} a closely related but single-tail-rotor design.|$|R
50|$|The Bell D-292 {{used the}} Avco Lycoming engines, transmission, two-bladed main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotors,</b> tailboom, {{vertical}} fin, and rotor pylon from the Bell 222. The new airframe replaced metal with composites for greater strength, reduced weight and both lower manufacturing and maintenance costs.|$|R
50|$|Bell D-292 : The Advanced Composite Airframe Program (ACAP) was a 1985 {{all-composite}} LHX proof-of-concept project. The Bell D-292 {{used the}} Avco Lycoming engines, transmission, two-bladed main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotors,</b> tailboom, vertical fin, and rotor pylon of the 222.

25|$|En route, the {{helicopter}} ran into poor weather and was then struck by lightning. This caused severe {{damage to the}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> Though {{the helicopter}} managed to limp {{for a few more}} minutes, the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> eventually failed completely and the pilot was forced to perform an emergency autorotation onto the rough seas. Emergency floaters on the helicopter allowed the passengers and crew to be evacuated onto a life raft. Despite the high waves and bad weather, all the people on board the flight were rescued.|$|E
50|$|Other than Airbus Helicopters and its predecessors, a Fenestron {{was also}} used on the U.S. Boeing/Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche, which was {{canceled}} in 2004. Ducted fan <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> have also {{been used in the}} Russian Kamov Ka-60, and also on the Japanese military's Kawasaki OH-1 Ninja helicopter.|$|R
50|$|Almost all {{helicopter}} {{engines are}} located above the aircraft, {{which tends to}} direct much of the engine-noise upwards. In addition, {{with the advent of}} the turbine engine, noise from the engine plays a much smaller role than it once did. Most research is now directed towards reducing the noise from the main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Mil Mi-54 was a {{projected}} twin-turbine civil utility helicopter, first announced in 1992, fit {{to replace the}} Mi-2 and the Mi-8 helicopters. It was planned to use two 574 kW Saturn/Lyulka AL-32 turboshaft engines, four-bladed main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotors,</b> and fixed tricycle-type landing gear with one nosewheel and two rear wheels on sponsons.|$|R
25|$|The Matra-Cantinieau MC-101 was {{an early}} 1950s French {{experimental}} two seat helicopter of conventional <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> configuration but with its engine mounted close to the main rotor, above the seating.|$|E
25|$|Ship No.2: (c/n 2) The second {{aircraft}} was built {{with a new}} three wheeled undercarriage, semi-monocoque fuselage, new <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> mounting and fully enclosed cockpit for pilot and passenger.|$|E
25|$|BK 117 A-4 :Introduced in July 1986, the A-4 has {{increased}} transmission limits at take-off power, improved <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> head. German aircraft have provision for extra internal fuel, giving enhanced performance.|$|E
2500|$|The final {{variant of}} the VS-300 was powered by a 150hp Franklin engine. The VS-300 {{was one of the}} first {{helicopters}} capable of carrying cargo. [...] The VS-300 was modified over a two-year period, including removal of the two vertical <b>tail</b> <b>rotors,</b> until 1941, when a new cyclic control system gave it much improved flight behavior.|$|R
50|$|The {{helicopters}} {{used were}} aged {{examples of a}} long-established design. Their <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> were removed, their fuselages shortened and they were attached to a crude tubular aluminum framework beneath the helium-filled envelope. Four freely-castering twin-wheel bogies beneath the framework provided the undercarriage. Criticism has been expressed of the structural qualities and stress analysis of this framework.|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} where {{a blade of}} symmetrical pro le was placed one chord upstream of another blade of identical dimensions but installed with miniature pressure transducers around the chord. The purpose of such a test was to simulate the e ect of multiple orthogonal vortex interactions which may occur within the <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> of helicopters. It was found that when the upstream blade was installed, the pressure response experienced by the instrumented blade was similar in form but reduced in magnitude by 50 % compared with results obtained without the upstream blade. This indicates that the vortex {{has the ability to}} reconnect and re-establish rotational and axial components after an initial cut. It also implies that noise and vibration radiating from <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> may be produced from multiple `cuts' of the same vortex. C. J. Doolan, F. N. Coton and R. A. McD.
