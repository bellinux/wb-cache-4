5|$|Hooper has all {{the main}} {{attributes}} to play as a striker, he is strong and can hold up <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>well.</b> He {{is also a good}} finisher, he has been described as being a 'penalty box striker'. However, he can also pass <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>well</b> and this allows midfielders to play-off him. He has received praise since moving to Scotland. Newspaper The Daily Record described him as being one of the most skilled attackers in the SPL. They also said that he had shown that he could deal with the physical nature of the Scottish game, due to his ability to ride a challenge well.|$|E
5|$|Alonso {{was born}} {{in the small town of}} Tolosa, Gipuzkoa, Basque Country, into a family known for its footballing prowess. His father, Periko Alonso, won La Liga twice in {{successive}} seasons with Real Sociedad and a third time after he joined Barcelona. He also featured in the national team, winning 21 caps over the course of his career. Xabi Alonso lived in the city of Barcelona for the first six years of his life and moved to San Sebastián (Donostia) thereafter. It was here that his passion for football began as he whiled away his childhood playing at Playa de la Concha (Shell Beach). On the Basque sands, Alonso befriended a fellow resident of Calle Matia, Mikel Arteta, and the two would battle each other in exhibitions of technical ability. He was immersed in football and his father would often bring him and his older brother, Mikel, to CE Sabadell's training ground to practice together. Alonso was influenced by his father's playing, taking more pleasure in passing <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>well</b> than shooting at goal. At an early age, he decided to play as a defensive midfielder, a role which helped him learn how to distribute <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>well.</b> This talent would later prove to be an integral part of his club and international career.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{had three}} quarterbacks on their roster {{entering}} the 1970 season in Gault, Bill Nelsen, and Mike Phipps. As training camp began, Browns coach Blanton Collier {{planned to use}} Gault in exhibition games, as he was throwing <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>well</b> in practice during the summer. By the end of preseason, Gault {{was named to the}} active roster as the Browns retained all three quarterbacks, an uncommon move at the time. During the Browns' second game against the San Francisco 49ers, starting quarterback Nelsen was injured, leading Gault to enter the game in the fourth quarter. He completed a pass to Gary Collins for 23 yards, threw an incompletion, and threw an interception to Dave Wilcox, allowing the 49ers to go on a game-winning drive in a 34-31 Browns loss.|$|E

50|$|A cultured forward, {{he was a}} good {{finisher}} {{who could}} also hold <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> up <b>well.</b> He had an extremely powerful shot.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} quarter, both teams moved <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> rather <b>well,</b> leading to field goals. The score {{going into the}} second quarter was a tied 3-3.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Australia, McCabe continued to captain New South Wales, but only played in two matches during the 193839 season due to illness, scoring 141 runs at 47.00 including one century. In the first match, {{to celebrate the}} centenary of the Melbourne Cricket Club, he struck 105 in only 140 minutes and timed <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>well,</b> but made 35 and 1 in the first Shield match and then absented himself {{from the rest of}} the season. McCabe had always been susceptible to illness and was dogged for much of 1938 and 1939. In his absence, New South Wales surrendered their title to South Australia, but they regained the mantle in 193940 upon the return of their captain. In his first match back, McCabe scored 98 to guide New South Wales to a three-wicket win over Queensland. After losing their next two matches, McCabe's men won their last three matches to take the title. The captain scored 59 and 55 and 49 and 114 in the last two matches against South Australia and Victoria respectively. A match between the Shield champions and the Rest of Australia was arranged and McCabe scored 72 and 96, steering his team to a narrow two-wicket win. He ended the season with 699 runs at 53.76 from seven matches, with a century and six fifties.|$|E
5|$|With 17minutes remaining, a Birmingham chance arose when Murphy outpaced Dave Ewing. Goalkeeper Trautmann dived at {{the feet}} of Murphy to win the ball, but in the {{collision}} Murphy's right knee hit Trautmann's neck with a forceful blow. Trautmann was knocked unconscious, and the referee stopped play immediately. Trainer Laurie Barnett rushed onto the pitch, and treatment continued for several minutes. No substitutes were permitted, so Manchester City would have to see out the game with ten men if Trautmann was unable to continue. Captain Roy Paul felt certain that Trautmann was not fit to complete the match, and wished to put Roy Little in goal instead. However, Trautmann, dazed and unsteady on his feet, insisted upon keeping his goal. He played out the remaining minutes in great pain, with the Manchester City defenders attempting to clear <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>well</b> upfield or into the stand whenever it came near. Trautmann was called upon to make two further saves to deny Brown and Murphy, the second causing him to recoil in agony due to a collision with Ewing, which required the trainer to revive him.|$|E
5|$|Verity {{followed}} this performance with five for 54 against Lancashire, but {{a week after}} his 10 wickets against Warwickshire, Frank Woolley hit four sixes from Verity's bowling as the Yorkshire bowler conceded 70runs from 12overs without taking a wicket. The rest of his season was successful. Favoured by pitches made receptive to his bowling by rain, he recorded impressive performances, earning selection for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's Cricket Ground, where he took five wickets in the Gentlemen's first innings. He was also selected in the less prestigious Gentlemen v Players fixtures at The Oval and Scarborough and was awarded his county cap by Yorkshire. Having been watched by England selectors, and after taking 11 wickets for Yorkshire in their match against the touring New Zealand team, Verity was selected {{in the final two}} Test matches of the series between England and the tourists. The first match was drawn after the New Zealand team performed above expectations and England brought in four new players, one of whom was Verity. On his debut, he took four wickets for 75runs in the game. The Cricketer noted room for improvements in his technique but observed he could spin <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>well.</b> England won the match and Verity was retained for the final Test. However, rain disrupted the match and he did not bowl. In his first full season of first-class cricket, Verity took 188wickets at an average of 13.52, finishing on top of the Yorkshire bowling averages and second in the national averages. Yorkshire won the County Championship and, according to Wisden, owed much of their success to Verity's bowling. Verity was selected as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year for his performances in the season. However, the citation said that despite his success and ability, he needed to improve the variety in the pace and flight of his bowling.|$|E

25|$|When {{day three}} began, England may have harboured hopes {{of picking up}} the last four Australian wickets quickly, and setting about {{building}} a solid lead, however Steve Waugh wanted to press on. He was seeing <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>well,</b> and moving {{into some of the}} best form of his career so far, and made the most of it. Well supported by Hughes, who made a solid 30, Waugh began to free his arms, and lifted the Australian's run-rate.|$|E
25|$|Pele played <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>well</b> {{ahead of}} Alberto, using space intelligently, {{so that the}} fast fullback ran on and shot without pausing, in full stride, smashing {{the ball into the}} Italian net. So {{effective}} was Brazil's use of width, that no Italian defender is even within reasonable striking distance of Alberto until the last moment. The principle of width stretched and drew the Italian defence. The principle of depth—fresh men moving up from the rear—allowed Brazil to exploit the gaps created by width.|$|E
25|$|Only 3.1 overs were {{possible}} in the afternoon session due to rain. Coming back after tea, England immediately lost two wickets to Shaun Tait, who used the cloud cover to good effect and swung <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>well.</b> However, Michael Vaughan and Kevin Pietersen batted well together for a 67-run partnership, although they were each dropped once. Towards {{the end of the}} day, Ricky Ponting brought himself on, and his medium pace yielded a wicket – that of Vaughan for 58. Overnight, the match was evenly poised with England 229 for 4.|$|E
50|$|Black was a midfielder with a {{reputation}} for hard work and skill. He had the ability to get under the pack to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> as <b>well</b> as deliver it with precision to teammates.|$|R
50|$|He {{is known}} as a {{skillful}} and creative midfielder, with vision and ability to both up the tempo and hold on to <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> as <b>well</b> as being able to play as a right winger.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "novice" [...] and [...] "expert" [...] {{switches}} {{affect the}} speed of the players on each side of <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> as <b>well</b> as receivers' ability to catch a pass if the player is human.|$|R
25|$|Aaron {{spent the}} winter of 1953 playing in Puerto Rico. Mickey Owen, the team's manager, helped Aaron with his batting stance. Up to that time, Aaron hit most pitches to left field or center field, but after working with Owen, Aaron was able {{to hit the ball}} more {{effectively}} all over the field. During his stay in Puerto Rico, Owen also helped Aaron to transition from second baseman to outfielder. Aaron had not played well at second base, but Owen had noted that Aaron could catch fly balls and throw <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>well</b> from the outfield to the infield.|$|E
25|$|Under Graham Taylor, many speculated his old {{mentor and}} manager at Watford {{would be able}} to get the best out of him, but his form was to become even less consistent; {{although}} this may have partly been down to the decline of English football as a whole during this period. In Graham Taylor's first match as England Manager (against Hungary), Barnes had appeared to be attacking positively and beating players and using <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>well.</b> This was a false dawn however and throughout a difficult time for the England squad, Barnes had few other highlights with the exception of scoring a stunning free kick against the Netherlands in a 1994 World Cup qualifying match.|$|E
25|$|Robinson was out LBW to Lawson for 12. Robin Smith caught {{behind by}} Healy off Alderman for 1. Gooch went next, caught Alderman bowled Lawson for 13, closely {{followed}} by Botham, LBW to Alderman for 4. Gower was caught cutting by Marsh at Gully for 15 off the bowling of Lawson, and England were reeling at 59 for 6. Australia smelt a route and were pressing {{the attack on}} all fronts with hostile bowling from an almost unplayable Alderman and an up-tempo Lawson. When either of them tired, England's 'relief' {{came in the form}} of pure intimidation from Merv Hughes, and Hohns, who was turning <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>well</b> on a fairly even track.|$|E
5000|$|Jamie's a big strong player, {{who holds}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> up <b>well.</b> He's got great feet and pace, which is {{everything}} you want in a striker. Former Dagenham and Port Vale teammate Doug Loft speaking on Guy.|$|R
50|$|Playing on {{both sides}} of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> as <b>well</b> as {{returning}} punts at Homestead (Fla.) High School, Waters had five punt return touchdowns, ten receiving touchdowns and two interceptions as a senior. He was a three-star recruit.|$|R
5000|$|The goaltender's role is {{to prevent}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> from going into the goal. Primarily, goalies use their stick to block shots. However, it is {{certainly}} not uncommon to see a goaltender use his/her body to block <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> as <b>well,</b> such as a chest or leg.|$|R
25|$|Blignaut {{was strangely}} subdued for the 33 {{deliveries}} he faced, {{and although he}} did attempt some ODI-style heaves, they mostly missed both his bat and the off stump. Blignaut was eventually lbw for 4, but Keith Dabengwa {{came to the rescue}} with an entertaining 35 to bat out the day. He yielded a catch to VVS Laxman at first slip off Irfan Pathan in the second over of the morning, however, as Zimbabwe only managed to add ten to their overnight score for the loss of three wickets. Pathan was the pick of the Indian bowlers, swinging <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>well</b> to dismiss Gavin Ewing and Blessing Mahwire as well, as Zimbabwe were all out for 279 – with Tatenda Taibu left not out for 71.|$|E

25|$|This time though, the openers began solidly {{putting on}} 50 {{for the first}} time in the series. When Ramesh was dismissed, Ganguly sent in VVS Laxman. Rahul Dravid had been {{struggling}} for runs for a while and Laxman had been stroking <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>well</b> before his unfortunate dismissal. Interestingly, Laxman had been asked to open the innings in this match but had refused. He seemed to pick up from where he had left off, batting serenely, and at times aggressively – a reminder that there were no demons in the pitch. Das departed, unfortunate to hit the stumps with his heels while having executed an immaculate pull shot to end a promising partnership with Laxman. Tendulkar soon followed, for a second failure in the match but Laxman found a willing ally in Sourav Ganguly. The pair set about repairing the damage done raising a hundred for the 4th wicket, but just when it seemed India would end the day with some semblance of balance, McGrath induced an edge that was lapped up gleefully by Gilchrist to dismiss Ganguly 2 runs short of a deserved half century. Out came Rahul Dravid, with scorecard reading 232/4. Laxman duly completed a hundred in Dravid's company.|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, Whalen {{protected}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> exceptionally <b>well,</b> fumbling just {{twice in}} his career.(1) Through {{the end of}} the 2010 season, only one tight end in history (Andrew Glover) had fewer career fumbles than Whalen while catching as many passes.(1) ...|$|R

5000|$|Keenan {{played as}} a 197 cm ruckman {{and was a}} solid marker of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> as <b>well</b> as having a good drop punt. He was {{recruited}} from Assumption College by Melbourne for whom he made his VFL debut in 1970.|$|R
500|$|Coach Yost added: [...] "Schultz {{is without}} doubt the best {{center in the}} country.

[...] In naming Schulz to his All-America team, Walter Camp said: [...] "He is well over six feet in height, yet a fast, powerful man who gets well over the field and makes more tackles in a game than any other man on his team. [...] In addition he is an accurate passer and feeds <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>well</b> to his backs either for kicks or runs".|$|E
500|$|Serevi then coached Fiji to {{the final}} of the London leg, where they were {{defeated}} by New Zealand. The final leg of the 2006–07 Series was in Edinburgh. Fiji needed to qualify for the semi-finals to guarantee they would win the series. They qualified top of pool A and faced Wales in their quarter-final. Wales defeated Fiji in 21–14 in a major upset. [...] "Wales kept <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>well</b> against us, and they scored tries. They deserved to win," [...] Serevi said of the loss. New Zealand then won the tournament, making them the series champions after accumulating 130 points to Fiji's 128. On 6 July 2007, Serevi announced his resignation as coach of the national sevens team.|$|E
500|$|Released by Tottenham {{at the end}} of the 1996–97 season, Wormull joined Second Division club Brentford on a free transfer, marking {{his debut}} in the Football League by missing the best chance of the match. He fell out of favour, and {{following}} a trial in Brighton & Hove Albion's reserves, was given a month's contract by manager Brian Horton, who described the player as someone who [...] "uses <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>well,...</b> gets forward and is quite aggressive". Injury prevented him playing for the first team during that period, or during another month at the start of the 1998–99 season; much to Horton's displeasure, Wormull rejected the offer of a further month, preferring to drop down to the Conference with Dover Athletic.|$|E
50|$|A notable {{long and}} short passer, Hurtado has also taken free kicks well. Although not able to <b>the</b> bend <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> as <b>well</b> as other notable free kick takers, he {{has been known to}} strike <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> with such force that goalkeepers find it hard to judge and time his shots.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "string tension" [...] of a racquet, usually {{expressed}} in pounds, indicates the pressure {{under which the}} strings are secured to the frame.
