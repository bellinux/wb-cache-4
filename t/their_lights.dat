25|$|The Maoz {{released}} its five boats at 21:10, and by 22:00, the boats were {{in close proximity}} to the Egyptian vessels. Two of the boats, manned by Ya'akov Vardi and Zalman Abramov, were intended for the actual sabotage, one as a reserve, manned by the commander Yohai Bin-Nun, and one to collect the commandos after the operation, manned by Yitzhak Brockman and Ya'akov Reitov. The Israeli sailors used helmets with infrared lights to ease the extraction process. The Egyptian ships, believing that a ceasefire was already in effect, had <b>their</b> <b>lights</b> on and were easy to spot. Despite this, according to a later Israeli estimate, they had been on full alert. Because the Egyptian ships were facing one another, Bin-Nun decided that Abramov and Vardi would attack the bows of the Emir Farouk and the minesweeper, respectively. This would {{make it more difficult for}} the Egyptians to fire at the boats should they have spotted them, because they could hit each other.|$|E
