5|$|And to <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Saw It on Mulberry Street is Theodor Seuss Geisel's first children's book. It was {{published}} under the pen name Dr. Seuss. First published by Vanguard Press in 1937, the story follows {{a boy named}} Marco, who describes a parade of imaginary people and vehicles traveling along a road, Mulberry Street, in an elaborate fantasy story he dreams up to tell his father {{at the end of}} his walk. However, when he arrives home he decides instead to tell his father what he actually saw—a simple horse and wagon.|$|E

25|$|He won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1958 for Horton Hatches the Egg {{and again}} in 1961 for And to <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Saw It on Mulberry Street. Geisel's birthday, March 2, has been adopted as the annual date for National Read Across America Day, an {{initiative}} on reading created by the National Education Association.|$|E

I can see it in his eye as he watches me. He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am tired of him,--tired of his sufferings, tired of his poverty, tired of the evil which men say of him. I am not sure but what he <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> suspect him." ...|$|R

25|$|I am {{sometimes}} {{inclined to}} think that in some parts - not all - of the Commonwealth, the old-fashioned traditional, and almost instinctive, standard of fair play to {{be observed by the}} Crown in dealing with subjects, which I learned a very long time ago to regard as elementary, is either not known or thought out of date. I should be glad to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am mistaken.|$|E
25|$|Geisel's {{earliest}} elephants {{were for}} advertising and had somewhat wrinkly ears, much as real elephants do. With And to <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Saw It on Mulberry Street! (1937) and Horton Hatches the Egg (1940), the ears became more stylized, somewhat like angel wings and thus {{appropriate to the}} saintly Horton. During World War II, the elephant image appeared as an emblem for India in four editorial cartoons. Horton and similar elephants appear frequently in the postwar children's books.|$|E
25|$|Geisel {{was born}} and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of Henrietta (née Seuss) and Theodor Robert Geisel. All four of his {{grandparents}} were German immigrants. His father managed the family brewery and was later appointed to supervise Springfield's public park system by Mayor John A. Denison after the brewery closed because of Prohibition. Mulberry Street in Springfield, made famous in Dr. Seuss' first children's book And to <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Saw It on Mulberry Street, is less than a mile southwest of his boyhood home on Fairfield Street. Geisel was raised a Lutheran. He enrolled at Springfield Central High School in 1917 and graduated in 1921. He took an art class as a freshman and later became manager of the school soccer team.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not if {{he knows}} I'm here," [...] replied Mrs. Leslie, tittering. [...] "He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am,--oh, {{something}} a great deal worse than I can tell you." ...|$|R

25|$|In 1936, {{the couple}} were {{returning}} from an ocean voyage to Europe when {{the rhythm of the}} ship's engines inspired the poem that became his first book: And to <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Saw It on Mulberry Street. Based on Geisel's varied accounts, the book was rejected by between 20 and 43 publishers. According to Geisel, he was walking home to burn the manuscript when a chance encounter with an old Dartmouth classmate led to its publication by Vanguard Press. Geisel wrote four more books before the US entered World War II. This included The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins in 1938, as well as The King's Stilts and The Seven Lady Godivas in 1939, all of which were in prose, atypically for him. This was followed by Horton Hatches the Egg in 1940, in which Geisel returned to the use of poetry.|$|E
25|$|I {{will say}} {{to you and to}} the colored race that men who bore arms and {{followed}} the flag of the Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E
500|$|A similar {{sentiment}} {{was expressed}} in a 1968 episode of the animated series Wacky Races titled [...] "The Wrong Lumber Race", where the villainous Dick Dastardly chops down a tree and uses it as a roadblock against the other racers, declaring proudly: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall never see / A roadblock lovely as a tree." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What fun!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Do {{send for}} him! He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am staying with Miss Pengarth, and I haven't written once since I got here!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is {{a clever}} fellow, and he <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a fool. Perhaps he is right, {{but he will}} find that the fool has been too many for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{was just}} thinking. Mamma <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{might go to}} college. If I went {{it would be nice}} if we went to two places that were near each other." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Nothing {{was really}} ever good enough. I brought home my college board scores—I think I got just under 1,400 the first time. She was crushed. She didn't {{understand}} how I {{could do so}} poorly. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> share {{a lot of those}} qualities. She used to have an expression that I would say is the guiding principle of my life: Always shoot for the stars and never settle for second best." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I don’t <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{have done}} enough events {{to win the}} rally just by driving skill, for instance. If I win, {{it will be because}} I {{have a little bit of}} luck and some of the others have trouble. I mean, Hannu Mikkola knows the forests like the back of his hand so there is no use trying to drive to beat him. You have to wait for him to have trouble. Then you are in with a chance." ...|$|E
500|$|It surpassed {{anything}} that I ever thought. [...] I didn't ever <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{should be in}} the cathedral with the Queen and all the dignitaries that were there. [...] And the singing, the organ, the Queen, just everything and everybody. [...] It's really been out of this world. [...] Just to hear Zadok the Priest, I think, has lifted me to Cloud Nine, because it's something that I love. [...] And to hear that and to have the Queen pass so close to me. [...] And yes, she smiled. [...] She smiled at me.|$|E
5000|$|According to Rabbi Moshe Feinstein in his book Igrot Moshe, marit ayin applies {{only when}} [...] "Someone <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{violated}} something, or he <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> inappropriately ate something non-kosher. However, {{it does not}} include doing something permitted that people may mistakenly think is forbidden {{due to the fact that}} they do not know the Jewish law." [...] Therefore, a permitted act which an onlooker might come to believe is a forbidden act being performed, is a case of marit ayin and thus not allowed. However, an act which is allowed which an onlooker might believe is forbidden is not case of marit ayin.|$|R

500|$|After {{leaving the}} church Keable and Sybil {{moved back to}} England, {{settling}} at West Wratting, Cambridgeshire, where both began to explore the Roman Catholic Church. Sybil converted and became a devout Catholic, but Keable also read works in contemporary philosophy and the books of Charles Darwin, and appears briefly to have lost his faith altogether. He wrote, {{of the history of}} Christianity, [...] "I can see creative evolution at work. What is behind it, I don't know. But I'm inclined to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do not believe it is anything which the old concept of God really covers." ...|$|E
500|$|Because of {{the varied}} {{reception}} to Kilmer's poem and its simple rhyme and meter, {{it has been}} the model for several parodies written by humorists and poets alike. [...] While keeping with Kilmer's iambic tetrameter rhythm and its couplet rhyme scheme, and references to the original poem's thematic material, such parodies are often immediately recognizable, as is seen in [...] "Song of the Open Road" [...] written by poet and humorist Ogden Nash: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall never see / A billboard lovely as a tree. / Indeed, unless the billboards fall, / I'll never see a tree at all." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1991, as Pixies were {{recording}} Trompe le Monde, Albini {{described his}} impressions of Pixies during {{the recording of}} Surfer Rosa to the fan magazine Forced Exposure: [...] "A patchwork pinch loaf from a band who at their top dollar best are blandly entertaining college rock. Their willingness to be 'guided' by their manager, their record company and their producers is unparalleled. Never have I seen four cows more anxious to be led around by their nose rings." [...] Albini later apologized for his remarks, saying, [...] "to this day I regret having done it. I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> regarded the band as significantly as I should have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's because I've no brother," [...] {{said the}} tigress. [...] "He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have no man near me to protect me. But he shall find <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can protect myself. John Eames, {{why are you}} {{treating}} me like this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But papa doesn't mean it. Papa {{says that}} you are nobody, and that you haven't got an income; and <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had better go back and be an old maid at the Mandarins." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must make}} him believe that. Do not tell him suddenly, but {{bring it in}} by degrees. He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am deceiving him. He would go back if he knew that papa were gone." ...|$|R
500|$|Director Brad Bird {{stated in}} 2007 {{that he was}} open {{to the idea of}} a sequel if he could come up with an idea {{superior}} to the original film: [...] "I have pieces that I think are good, but I don't have them all together." [...] During an interview in May 2013, Bird reiterated his interest in making a sequel. [...] "I have been thinking about it. People <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have not been, but I have. Because I love those characters and love that world," [...] said Bird. [...] "I am stroking my chin and scratching my head. I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another Incredibles film, and if I can get ‘em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Judith and Neil Morgan, Geisel {{conceived}} {{the core of}} Mulberry Street {{in the summer of}} 1936 aboard the MS Kungsholm, a Swedish American luxury liner, during the return trip from a European vacation with his wife, Helen Palmer. As the Kungsholm endured a storm and Geisel suffered from sea sickness, he jotted down a rambling plot that started with [...] "a stupid horse and wagon". To keep himself occupied, he began reciting poetry to the rhythm of the ship's engines and soon found himself saying, [...] "And that is a story that no one can beat, and to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> saw it on Mulberry Street." [...] For days after they landed, he had the rhythm of the ship's engine stuck in his head, so, at Helen's suggestion, he decided to write a story based around it.|$|E
500|$|Corgan insisted {{during this}} period that the band would not reform, {{although}} when Zwan broke up he announced, [...] "I think my heart was in Smashing Pumpkins [...] I think it was naive of me to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could find something that would mean as much to me." [...] Corgan said in 2005, [...] "I never wanted to leave the Smashing Pumpkins. That was never the plan." [...] On February 17, 2004, Corgan posted a message on his personal blog calling Wretzky a [...] "mean-spirited drug addict" [...] and blaming Iha for {{the breakup of the}} Smashing Pumpkins. On June 3, 2004, he added that [...] "the depth of my hurt [...] is only matched with the depth of my gratitude". Iha responded to Corgan's claims in 2005, saying, [...] "No, I didn't break up the band. The only person who could have done that is Billy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Miserable craven!' she exclaimed. 'Has the cowardly tyrant fled? And {{he really}} <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am to be crushed by such an {{instrument}} as this! Pah! He may leave Monmouth House, but I shall not. Begone, sir!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{he knows}} also how his lordship is {{behaving}} to me. Of course he <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have deserved it. Of course I have deserved it. We {{have nothing to}} do now but to go back to London." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tekla has {{not been}} near me for several days," [...] {{explained}} Miss Haldin quickly. [...] "As I never offered {{to go to the}} hospital with her, she <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have no heart. She is disillusioned about me." ...|$|R
