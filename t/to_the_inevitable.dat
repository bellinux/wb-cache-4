5|$|As {{the chief}} {{parliamentary}} spokesman for an abandoned policy, Calvert no longer served a useful purpose to the English Royal Court, and by February 1624 his duties had been restricted to placating the Spanish ambassador. The degree of his disfavour was shown {{when he was}} reprimanded for supposedly delaying diplomatic letters. Calvert bowed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable.</b> On the pretext of ill health, he began negotiations {{for the sale of}} his position, finally resigning the secretariat in February 1625.|$|E
5|$|Having {{managed to}} quietly depose their father, the {{brothers}} {{now had to}} deal with Constantine VII. Unfortunately for them, rumours soon spread around Constantinople, to the effect that, following Romanos's deposition, Constantine VII's life was in danger. Before long, crowds gathered before the palace, demanding to see their emperor in person. The contemporary Lombard historian Liutprand of Cremona notes that the ambassadors and envoys from Amalfi, Gaeta, Rome, and Provence present in the capital also supported Constantine VII. Stephen and his brother had to succumb <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable,</b> recognizing their brother-in-law as the senior emperor.|$|E
5|$|On September 11, 2012, the U.S. {{diplomatic}} mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, {{resulting in the}} deaths of the U.S. Ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S. On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses and said the differing explanations were due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> fog of war confusion after such events.|$|E

5|$|On 1 April, Alexander {{addressed}} the Sénat conservateur. Long docile to Napoleon, under Talleyrand's prodding {{it had turned}} against him. Alexander told the Sénat that the Allies were fighting against Napoleon, not France, and {{they were prepared to}} offer honorable peace terms if Napoleon were removed from power. The next day, the Sénat passed the Acte de déchéance de l'Empereur ("Emperor's Demise Act"), which declared Napoleon deposed. Napoleon had advanced as far as Fontainebleau when he learned that Paris was lost. When Napoleon proposed the army march on the capital, his senior officers and marshals mutinied. On 4 April, led by Ney, they confronted Napoleon. Napoleon asserted the army would follow him, and Ney replied the army would follow its generals. While the ordinary soldiers and regimental officers wanted to fight on, without any senior officers or marshals any prospective invasion of Paris would have been impossible. Bowing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable,</b> on 4 April Napoleon abdicated in favour of his son, with Marie Louise as regent. However, the Allies refused to accept this under prodding from Alexander, who feared that Napoleon might find an excuse to retake the throne. Napoleon was then forced to announce his unconditional abdication only two days later.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of the Middle Ages, the Vulgate had succumbed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> changes wrought by human error in the countless copies made of the text in monasteries across Europe. From its {{earliest}} days, readings from the Old Latin were introduced. Marginal notes were erroneously interpolated into the text.|$|E

25|$|The {{data about}} the populations of binary objects are still patchy. In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> observational bias (dependence on the distance from Earth, size, albedo and separation of the components) the frequency appears to be different among different categories of objects. Among asteroids, an estimated 2% would have satellites. Among trans-Neptunian objects (TNO), an estimated 11% {{are thought to be}} binary or multiple objects, and the majority of the large TNOs have at least one satellite, including all four IAU-listed dwarf planets.|$|E
25|$|The {{marriage}} was now doomed. Still without {{a son and}} {{in danger of being}} left with no male heir, facing substantial opposition to Eleanor from many of his barons and her own desire for annulment, Louis bowed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable.</b> On 11 March 1152, they met at the royal castle of Beaugency to dissolve the marriage. Hugues de Toucy, Archbishop of Sens, presided, and Louis and Eleanor were both present, as were the Archbishops of Bordeaux and Rouen. Archbishop Samson of Reims acted for Eleanor.|$|E
25|$|De Gaulle {{was educated}} in Paris at the Collège Stanislas and studied briefly in Belgium where he {{continued}} to display his interest in reading and studying history and shared the great pride many of his countrymen felt in their nation's achievements. At the age of fifteen he wrote an essay imagining “General de Gaulle” leading the French Army to victory over Germany in 1930; he later wrote that in his youth he had looked forward with somewhat naive anticipation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> future war with Germany to avenge the French defeat of 1870.|$|E
500|$|The Poor Law was not {{designed}} <b>to</b> address <b>the</b> issue of poverty, which was considered <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> lot for most people; rather it was concerned with pauperism, [...] "the inability of an individual to support himself".

25|$|As the Ottomans {{advanced}} towards Vienna, the city's population organised an ad-hoc resistance {{formed from}} local farmers, peasants and civilians determined <b>to</b> repel <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> attack. <b>The</b> defenders {{were supported by}} a variety of European mercenaries, namely German Landsknecht pikemen and Spanish musketeers sent by Charles V.|$|R

25|$|The {{change in}} {{political}} structure led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> {{development of the}} peasant class or smerdy. The smerdy were free un-landed people that found work by labouring for wages on the manors which began to develop around 1031 as the verv' began to dominate socio-political structure. The smerdy were initially given equality in the Kievian law code, they were theoretically equal to the prince, so they enjoyed as much freedom as can be expected of manual labourers. However, in the 13th century they began to slowly lose their rights and became less equal {{in the eyes of}} the law.|$|E
25|$|For a time British {{authorities}} threatened Masterman {{with legal}} action, {{but in the}} end bowed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> and allowed publication, with the proviso that sixty passages in the manuscript be deleted. Kerr would only acquiesce to a dozen. The book, The Double-Cross System in the War of 193945, was finally published in February 1972, with a foreword by Pearson, who guardedly did not refer to his work in the Committee. Masterman himself wrote the book without revealing anything about Ultra, still highly secret, that greatly aided the double-cross system. The ban on Ultra would be lifted in 1974.|$|E
25|$|This {{reduction}} had {{a direct}} impact upon Jackson's ability to defend the lower Shenandoah Valley, {{and led to the}} need to evacuate Winchester on March 9 in the face of superior forces advancing to Winchester under Union Maj. Gen. Banks. Therefore, despite having prevented Rosecrans's goal of taking Winchester in January or February 1862, the insurrection of Loring's Division and its subsequent reassignment led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> seizure of Winchester by General Banks in March. It was not until Jackson was able to be reinforced with more disciplined and seasoned troops from Major General Richard S. Ewell's Division that {{he would be able to}} retake the initiative in the Shenandoah Valley.|$|E

50|$|A new {{generation}} of Greek politicians was growing increasingly intolerant of King Otto's continuing interference in government. In 1862, the King dismissed his Prime Minister, the former admiral Constantine Kanaris, the most prominent politician of the period. This provoked a military rebellion, forcing Otto <b>to</b> accept <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> and leave <b>the</b> country.|$|R
25|$|Just as {{the tactic}} of not setting a rate became popular among the councils subject to rate-capping, the Government {{suffered}} a {{defeat in the}} House of Lords which gave the GLC an extra year of existence and subjecting it to budgeting and rate-capping for 1985–86. Owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> split in the Labour group of councillors, it was agreed not to debate the issue until just before the deadline; in the meantime, to stop the Government setting a harsh cap on the budget, the council ordered that no detailed budget documents would be published. John McDonnell was given the responsibility of leading the campaign in which he claimed that the rate-capping would require a reduction of £138m in the planned spending.|$|E
25|$|Two weeks later, 11 of the {{remaining}} 12 republics—all except Georgia—signed the Alma-Ata Protocol, which confirmed the Soviet Union had been effectively dissolved and replaced by a new voluntary association, the Commonwealth of Independent States. Bowing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable,</b> Gorbachev resigned as Soviet president on 25 December, and the Supreme Soviet ratified the Belavezha Accords the next day, legally dissolving itself and the Soviet Union as a political entity. By the end of 1991, the few Soviet institutions that hadn't {{been taken over by}} Russia had dissolved. The Soviet Union was officially disbanded, breaking up into fifteen constituent parts, thereby ending the world's largest and most influential Socialist state, and leaving to China that position. A constitutional crisis dissolved into violence in Moscow as the Russian Army was called in to reestablish order.|$|E
25|$|Klaas A. Posthuma {{argues that}} neither Tristan nor Isolde try {{for one moment}} to ignore their {{feelings}} of {{love for each other}} nor do they try to overcome them. On the contrary, they yield to their feelings with all their hearts – but secretly. This has nothing whatsoever to do with the Schopenhauer doctrine. Another important point in this philosophy is Schopenhauer's opinion about finding happiness with one woman only, which he rejected – his reason for never marrying. But for Tristan there is only one woman, Isolde, with Death as alternative. And this leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> conclusion that it was not Schopenhauer and his doctrine that were responsible for the creation of Wagner's sublime music drama but his unfulfilled love for the woman he met and loved during these years, Mathilde Wesendonck.|$|E

25|$|Following the degenerating loss of {{administrative}} control by the Government {{in the first}} days of March 1997, culminating in the desertion of most Police and many Republican Guard and Army units, leaving their armouries open <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> looting which soon followed, several Nations autonomously helped evacuate their Nationals, causing wider concerns about the fate of others. The UN Security Council therefore agreed United Nations Security Council Resolution 1101 as a stop-gap operation to manage this and buy time, laying the foundations for another International Organisation to manage a planned reconstruction, which after six weeks of debate fell to the Western European Union, creating the Multinational Albanian Police Element around a command structure of Italian Military Carabinieri, which actually undertook the work of Judicial and Police reconstruction, extending into the elimination of the economic causes of the crisis.|$|E
25|$|By 17 February, Soviet {{infantry}} and cavalry divisions supported by aircraft {{were less than}} 15 kilometers northeast of Tbilisi. The Georgian army put up a stubborn fight {{in defense of the}} approaches to the capital, which they held for a week in the face of overwhelming Red Army superiority. From 18 to 20 February, the strategic heights of Kojori and Tabakhmela passed from hand to hand in heavy fighting. Georgian forces under General Giorgi Mazniashvili managed to push the Soviets back inflicting heavy losses; they quickly regrouped and tightened the circle around Tbilisi. By 23 February, the railway bridges had been restored, and Soviet tanks and armoured trains joined in a renewed assault on the capital. While the armoured trains laid down suppressing fire, tanks and infantry penetrated the Georgian positions on the Kojori heights. On 24 February, the Georgian commander-in-chief, Giorgi Kvinitadze, bowed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> and ordered a withdrawal to save his army from complete encirclement and the city from destruction. The Georgian government and the Constituent Assembly evacuated to Kutaisi in western Georgia, which dealt the Georgian army a significant moral blow.|$|E
25|$|Life {{in his own}} monastery proved no more congenial than before. For this Abelard {{himself was}} partly responsible. He took a sort of {{malicious}} pleasure in irritating the monks. As if {{for the sake of}} a joke, he cited Bede to prove that the believed founder of the monastery of St Denis, Dionysius the Areopagite had been Bishop of Corinth, while the other monks relied upon the statement of the Abbot Hilduin that he had been Bishop of Athens. When this historical heresy led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> persecution, Abelard wrote a letter to the Abbot Adam in which he preferred to the authority of Bede that of Eusebius of Caesarea's Historia Ecclesiastica and St. Jerome, according to whom Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth, was distinct from Dionysius the Areopagite, bishop of Athens and founder of the abbey, though, in deference to Bede, he suggested that the Areopagite might also have been bishop of Corinth. Adam accused him of insulting both the monastery and the Kingdom of France (which had Denis as its patron saint); life in the monastery grew intolerable for Abelard, and he was finally allowed to leave.|$|E
