The Indiana Toll Road was leased to Statewide Mobility Partners, a joint venture company owned by Spanish firm Cintra and Australia's Macquarie Infrastructure Group for 75 years {{in exchange for a}} one time payment of $3.85 billion. The measure was opposed by most Democrats, who began an advertising campaign accusing Daniels of selling the road to foreign nations.

5|$|A {{feature of}} central York is the Snickelways, narrow {{pedestrian}} routes, {{many of which}} led towards the former market-places in Pavement and St Sampson's Square. The Shambles is a narrow medieval street, lined with shops, boutiques and tea rooms. Most of these premises were once butchers' shops, and the hooks from which carcasses were hung and the shelves on which meat was laid out can still be seen outside some of them. The street also contains the Shrine of Margaret Clitherow, {{although it is not}} located in the house where she lived.

5|$|After the play's initial run, Kooman {{revised the}} script, making {{prominent}} {{changes in the}} scenes involving Jason and Marta. In the version performed at the premiere, the two characters debate issues of human rights on a solely philosophical level, while in the new version, Marta makes real demands of Jason, making their interactions more dynamic. Kooman made Jason's wife Ali more patient and understanding in dealing with Jason's lengthy absences from home and removed the intermission. According to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate, Kooman's changes strengthened the emotional pull of the play. Because {{of the amount of}} interest in She Has a Name in 2011, not enough tickets were available for the initial run, and a second run was planned for the end of 2011. <b>To</b> <b>finance</b> <b>a</b> tour of the play, Burnt Thicket Theatre raised money through fundraisers, which included the 2011 Calgary Ride for Refuge.|$|E
5|$|Alan Ball the {{previous}} chairman became executive deputy chairman, with Smallpeice requesting a non-executive deputy chairman position, which was quickly agreed to.

The board quickly become concerned at the behaviour of their chief executive Tiny Rowland who had agreed in principle <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> <b>a</b> sugar refinery in Sudan {{at a cost of}} £80 to £100 million, whilst the company {{was in the midst of}} refinancing itself. The board was able to reword the agreement and it became a feasibility study, recovering the situation but respite from a further crisis would prove to be short lived. The situation at Lonrho went from bad to worse during early 1973, when Peats, Lonrho's auditors, discovered payments totalling £44,000 made from a subsidiary company based in the Cayman Islands to Duncan Sandys. Sandys, believing that the payment had been authorised by the board returned in full the money he had received.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, soaring demand for coffee and rubber brought {{prosperity}} to the Brazilian economy. The government of Brazil used some of the extra money from this economic growth <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> <b>a</b> large naval building program in 1904, which authorized the construction of a large number of warships, including three battleships. The Minister of the Navy, Admiral Júlio César de Noronha, signed a contract with Armstrong Whitworth for three battleships on 23 July 1906. While the first designs for these ships were derived from the Norwegian coastal defense ship Norge and the British (originally Chilean) , the contracted ships were to follow Armstrong Whitworth's Design 439 (Design 188 in Vickers' files). They would displace 11,800longtons (12,000tonnes), have a speed of 19knots (22mph; 35km/h), and be protected by belt armor of 9inches (23cm) and deck armor of 1.5 in (3.8cm). Each ship would be armed with twelve 10-inch (25cm) guns mounted in six twin turrets. These turrets would be mounted in a hexagonal configuration, similar to the later German s.|$|E
5|$|By 2001 NFF was in {{the process}} of {{implementing}} new stadium requirements in the top leagues, and Briskeby would no longer be permitted to be used in the top tier. Ham-Kam entered an alliance with Totalprosjekt—an real estate development company working on Lillestrøm's Åråsen Stadion—who presented a concept <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> <b>a</b> new venue: The municipality would transfer property to a limited company jointly owned by the municipality and the major sports clubs, the real estate would be re-regulated to increase their value, and the company would use this capital to build a new professional and a new recreational stadium. Parallel with this, a municipal commission made a report that recommended a consolidation in the number of venues in town and the conversion of gravel and grass fields to artificial turf. The commission recommended that a new professional football venue be built either at Briskeby or Hamar stadion.|$|E
5|$|Clement's {{position}} as Bishop of Dunblane provided {{the opportunity to}} participate on the larger national and international stage. In 1241, the Cistercian general chapter began postulating the Pope about the saintliness of Edmund of Abingdon, formerly Archbishop of Canterbury. In the following year, various clerics wrote pieces and compiled evidence supporting this Edmund's claim to sainthood. Clement was one of these clerics. Edmund's saintliness was endorsed by Pope Innocent IV in 1246. Clement took part in a similar campaign in 1249. He was part of the movement to canonise Queen Margaret, one of the ancestors of the contemporary Scottish kings. Clement was appointed to investigate her saintliness, and in the following year Margaret too was canonised. Meanwhile, in 1247, Pope Innocent IV gave Clement the more onerous and demanding appointment of papal tax collector. Clement was charged with collecting one twentieth of all ecclesiastical revenues within the Kingdom of the Scots. The purpose was <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> <b>a</b> new crusade, and Clement's appointment was part of a money-raising initiative carried out throughout Western Christendom.|$|E
50|$|The {{outcome of}} the Parliament of 1624 was ambiguous: James still refused to declare war, but Charles {{believed}} the Commons had committed themselves <b>to</b> <b>financing</b> <b>a</b> war against Spain, a stance which was to contribute to his problems with Parliament in his own reign.|$|R

5|$|Fresh {{conflict}} {{broke out}} in 1127, when Charles, the childless Count of Flanders, was murdered, creating a local succession crisis. Backed by King Louis, William Clito was chosen by the Flemings to become their new ruler. This development potentially threatened Normandy, and Henry began <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> <b>a</b> proxy war in Flanders, promoting the claims of William's Flemish rivals. In an effort to disrupt the French alliance with William, Henry mounted an attack into France in 1128, forcing Louis to cut his aid to William. William died unexpectedly in July, removing the last major challenger to Henry's rule and bringing the war in Flanders to a halt. Without William, the baronial opposition in Normandy lacked a leader. A fresh peace was made with France, and the King {{was finally able to}} release the remaining prisoners from the revolt of 1123, including Waleran of Meulan, who was rehabilitated into the royal court.|$|E
5|$|In 1556 the sheikdom {{was led by}} Sheikh Abu Rayyan bin Sheikh Manna, who was {{succeeded by}} Sheikh Muhammad Abu Rabban in 1560. Olive oil was the primary {{commodity}} that Bani Zeid Nahiya produced and the product was sold to local Ottoman officials and soap factories in Nablus. The Ottomans imposed taxes on olive oil, wheat and barley, and the sheikh was responsible for paying the revenues of collected taxes to the Ottoman authorities. In addition, Bani Zeid was required <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> <b>a</b> waqf (religious endowment) to the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. In 1596 both Deir Ghassaneh and Beit Rima appeared in Ottoman tax registers and both villages paid taxes on wheat, barley, olive trees, fruit trees, vineyards, goats and/or beehives. Deir Ghassaneh had a population of 76 households, all Muslim, while Beit Rima had 54 Muslim households and 14 Christian households. During {{the course of the}} 16th century, most of Beit Rima's Christian inhabitants had emigrated from the village to Jerusalem, Ramla and Gaza, although the Christian population that remained continued to grow.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Harry Frazee {{purchased}} the Red Sox, on credit, for $500,000. Despite Ruth's {{success with the}} Red Sox, owner and Broadway producer Frazee lost his patience with Ruth, who had threatened to hold out {{in lieu of a}} larger contract and become a distraction. After the Red Sox finished sixth in the American League in 1919, Frazee, needing money <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> <b>a</b> Broadway musical, No, No Nanette, sold pitcher-turned-outfielder Babe Ruth to the Yankees. Frazee received $125,000 and a loan of $300,000—secured on Fenway Park, the Red Sox' home stadium—for Ruth, despite Ruth having set the record for home runs with 29 in 1919. This began a series of deals with the Yankees that resulted in a long period of mediocrity for the Red Sox while the Yankees began their dynasty.|$|E
40|$|Small and {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) have a fundamental {{role in the}} economic growth and job creation in almost all economies in the world. Access <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> is fundamental for the survival and growth of SMEs. However, financial constraints are considered {{to be one of the}} most important factors that impede the growth of these firms. To contribute to the understanding of the financial constraints faced by SMEs, this paper sets out to find the firm level determinants of perception of access <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> as <b>an</b> obstacle <b>to</b> the operations of Turkish SMEs. We find that size, age, percentage of sales exported and business group affiliation do not have an effect on the tendency to see access <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> as <b>an</b> obstacle. Audited firms are less inclined to see access <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> as <b>an</b> obstacle <b>to</b> their operations. This inclination decreases with an increase in the percentage of sales exported. Firms that have made a recent credit application have a lower tendency to see access <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> as <b>an</b> obstacle. This tendency is strengthened with an increase in the percentage of sales exported...|$|R
