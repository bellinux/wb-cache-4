Each class works {{together}} for one year on programming for Wash U’s campus, the internal Chapter, and the chosen partner philanthropy, with the freedom to follow their own path for the year. Each member has a name assigned to them that represents an aspect of what <b>they</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> the Honorary (such as intrepidity or flair). Washington University's Chapter of Chimes Junior Honorary was founded in 1948, and has contributed to campus life at Washington University for over half a century. Their main campus program is Chimes Week, a Chimes tradition that explores a particular theme. Like ThurtenE, Chimes has been a co-ed society since 1991.|$|E

25|$|On {{the second}} day of unleavened bread, that is to say the sixteenth, our people partake of the crops which they have reaped and which have not been touched till then, and esteeming it right first to do homage to God, to whom they owe the {{abundance}} of these gifts, they offer to him the first-fruits of the barley in the following way.

25|$|In Steve Lenius' {{original}} 2001 {{paper he}} explored {{the acceptance of}} bisexuality in a supposedly pansexual BDSM community. The reasoning behind this is that 'coming-out' had become primarily {{the territory of the}} gay and lesbian, with bisexuals feeling the push to be one or the other (and being right only half the time either way). What he found in 2001, was that people in BDSM were open to discussion about the topic of bisexuality and pansexuality and all controversies <b>they</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> the table, but personal biases and issues stood in the way of actively using such labels. A decade later, Lenius (2011) looks back on his study and considers if anything has changed. He concluded that the standing of bisexuals in the BDSM and kink community was unchanged, and believed that positive shifts in attitude were moderated by society's changing views towards different sexualities and orientations. But Lenius (2011) does emphasize that the pansexual promoting BDSM community helped advance greater acceptance of alternative sexualities.|$|E
500|$|Arguing for {{the renewal}} of the series for a third season {{following}} its low viewership, Ryan said that [...] "letting the show die would be a serious mistake, for the network and for the bigger Disney-ABC conglomerate...These days, entertainment properties have to be viewed not just {{through the lens of}} their ratings (admittedly weak for Agent Carter). They have to be evaluated {{within the context of the}} overall value <b>they</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> any entertainment colossus, and what Agent Carter adds to Disney-ABC is simply too valuable to give up... something different to the company's superhero portfolio." [...] She suggested if ABC did not renew the series for broadcast, that it should explore other opportunities, such as debuting on its online Watch ABC app, or being sold to Netflix, where [...] "fans of super-heroic storytelling already flock to" [...] and Agent Carters [...] "status as a period piece—which may have harmed it on broadcast—could be a real draw for Netflix viewers". Ryan also felt Marvel [...] "could copy what CBS is [...] " [...] by creating a subscription service for a monthly fee, where consumers could access Marvel's films and televisions shows [...] "as well as premium exclusives like a third season of Agent Carter". Ryan concluded, [...] "A third Agent Carter season could help solidify Marvel's standing not just with female fans, but with everyone who appreciates excellent and adventurous storytelling." ...|$|E

500|$|The folk metal genre has {{dramatically}} expanded with {{the turn of}} the new millennium. At the forefront of this explosion, with a [...] "revolutionary clash of tradition and amplification that set them apart", is a group from Finland known as Finntroll. The band was formed in 1997 with a demo recorded the following year and a debut album Midnattens widunder released in 1999. They have since developed a reputation for being [...] "obsessed with all things trollish." [...] Their lyrics are sung exclusively in Swedish instead of the Finnish language [...] "apparently because this language was better to evoke the trollish spirit", even though the real reason for this lies in the band's original vocalist belonging to the Swedish-speaking minority. The music of Finntroll features a [...] "real innovation" [...] in the marriage of black metal music with a style of Finnish polka called humppa. Specifically, the band took from humppa [...] "the alternate picking bass lines accompanied with the drumbeat, and the use of accordion." [...] This unlikely mix of polka and extreme metal has received a mixed reception from critics. Andy Hinds of Allmusic laments the polka influence as undermining [...] "the intended threat of a death metal band" [...] while his colleague Alex Henderson praises the band for their [...] "solid, consistently likable effort," [...] declaring that Finntroll has set themselves apart from their peers [...] "because of their emphasis on Finnish humppa" [...] and [...] "the humor and irony <b>they</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> the table." ...|$|E

2500|$|Concerning wealth {{distribution}} {{among the}} population, Prout argues for an „optimal inequality“ where the wage {{gap between the}} richer strata of society is substantially subsided [...] As Richard Freeman, a Harvard economist, points out income inequality comes from the monopoly of power and other activities with „negative consequences“ {{in terms of social}} development [...] Nonetheless Prout is not in favour of total income equality, claiming that in a society where material motivation to work is absent, the willingness to strive for financial success and to thrive in the creative development of industry and socierty will be lost in its citizens. Therefore, Sarkar argues for the implementation of a policy allowing the most meritous in society to receive added perks for the added benefits <b>they</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> society. It is thus theorized that the communist‘s motto of from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs cannot work in the real world. PROUT proposes instead a minimum and maximum wage, roughly attributed according to the value the work of each person brings to society. We see examples of attempts in this direction in companies like Mondragon or Whole Foods.|$|E
2500|$|A typical {{admission}} {{staff at}} a college includes a dean or vice president for admission or enrollment management, middle-level managers or assistant directors, admission officers, and administrative support staff.

Admissions officers tend {{to be in the}} 30-to-40 age demographic. They are chosen for their experience in admissions, aptitude for statistics and data analysis, experience in administration and marketing and public relations. They serve dual roles as counselors and recruiters, and do not see themselves as marketers or salespeople, according to one view. They are evaluated on how well they [...] "represent their college, manage their office, recruit staff members, and work with other administrators". Michele Hernandez suggested there were basically two types of officers: a first group of personable, sharp, people-oriented go-getter types who were often recent college grads; a second group was somewhat out-of-touch [...] "lifers" [...] who often did not graduate from a highly selective college. Officers are generally paid an annual salary, although there have been reports of some recruiters paid on the basis of how many students <b>they</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> a college, such as recruiters working abroad to recruit foreign students to U.S. universities.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} God {{instructed}} Moses {{to cause a}} lamp to burn in the Tabernacle not because God needed the light, but so that the Israelites {{might be able to}} give light to God as God gave light to the Israelites. The Midrash likened this to the case of a man who could see, walking along with a blind man. The seeing man offered to guide the blind man. When they came home, the seeing man asked the blind man to kindle a lamp for him and illumine his path, so that the blind man would no longer be obliged to the seeing man for having accompanied the blind man on the way. The seeing man of the story is God, for 2 Chronicles [...] and [...] say, [...] "For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth." [...] And the blind man is Israel, as [...] says, [...] "We grope for the wall like the blind, yea, as they that have no eyes do we grope; we stumble at noon-day as in the twilight" [...] (and the Israelites stumbled in the matter of the Golden Calf at midday). God illumined the way for the Israelites (after they stumbled with the Calf) and led them, as [...] says, [...] "And the Lord went before them by day."

2500|$|The {{following}} year, Foster founded her {{own production}} company, Egg Pictures, {{a subsidiary of}} PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. She was to produce up to six films, each with the budget of $10–25 million, in the following three years. Her next films were a romantic period film and a comedy, and according to film scholar Karen Hollinger, featured her in more [...] "conventionally feminine" [...] roles. She starred opposite Richard Gere in Sommersby (1993), portraying a woman who begins to suspect that her husband who returns home from the Civil War is in fact an impostor. She then replaced Meg Ryan in the Western comedy Maverick (1994), playing a con artist opposite Mel Gibson and James Garner. Both films were box office hits, earning over $140 and $183 million respectively. Foster's first project for Egg Pictures, Nell, was released in December 1994. In addition to acting as its producer, she starred {{in the title role}} as a woman who grew up isolated in the Appalachian Mountains and speaks her own language as her only human connection has been her disabled mother. It was based on Mark Handley's play Idioglossia, which interested Foster for its theme of [...] "otherness", and because she [...] "loved this idea of a woman who defies categorization, a creature who is labeled and categorized by people based on their own problems and their own prejudices and what <b>they</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> the table." [...] It was a moderate commercial success, but a critical disappointment. Despite the negative reviews, Foster received a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance and was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} {{everything}} God created in heaven has a replica on earth. And the Midrash taught that {{many things in}} the Tabernacle reflected things in heaven.
