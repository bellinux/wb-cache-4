5|$|A {{variation}} of this theory by some present-day residents of Kaliningrad (formerly Königsberg), {{is that at}} least parts of the room {{were found in the}} Königsberg Castle cellars after World War II by the Red Army. The Amber Room was allegedly still in good condition; this was not admitted at the time so the blame could fall upon the Nazis. To preserve this story, access to the ruins of the castle, which was allowed after World War II, was suddenly restricted to all, including historical and archaeological surveys, but the room is said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> storehouse near Konigsburg castle.|$|E

30|$|The RSI {{ranges from}} 0 to 100, with {{high and low}} levels marked at 70 and 30, respectively. Traditionally, RSI {{readings}} greater than the 70 level <b>are</b> considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> overbought territory (Bearish signal), whereas RSI readings lower than the 30 level <b>are</b> considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> oversold territory (Bullish signal). In between the 30 and 70 level is considered neutral, with the 50 level a sign of no trend.|$|R

5|$|Above {{the layer}} of {{metallic}} hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.2858 MPa and critical temperature of only 32.938K. In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases—hydrogen is said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> supercritical fluid state. It is convenient to treat hydrogen as gas in the upper layer extending downward from the cloud layer {{to a depth of}} about 1,000km, and as liquid in deeper layers. Physically, there is no clear boundary—the gas smoothly becomes hotter and denser as one descends.|$|E
5|$|After {{the victory}} at Romani, Murray moved his {{headquarters}} back from Ismailia on the canal to Cairo. This move to Cairo was to enable him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more central position {{to carry out}} his duties and responsibilities which extended from the Western Frontier Force, waging a continuing campaign against the Senussi in Egypt's Western Desert, to the Eastern Force in the Sinai. Another consequence of the victory was that Major General H. A. Lawrence, who had been in command of the Northern Sector of the Suez Canal defences and Romani during the battle, was transferred to the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone target shooting together. He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had left it on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E
30|$|Basically, {{the current}} security’s price is {{expressed}} {{as a percentage of}} this range with 0  % indicating the bottom of the range and 100  % indicating the upper limits of the range over the time period covered. The idea behind is that prices tend to close near the extremes of the recent range before turning points. Traditionally, Stochastic Oscillator readings greater than the 80 level <b>are</b> considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> overbought territory (Bearish signal), whereas readings lower than the 20 level <b>are</b> considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> oversold territory (Bullish signal).|$|R

5|$|Best was {{studying}} at the Collegiate Grammar School {{when he decided}} he wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> music group, so Mona bought him a drum kit from Blackler's music store and Best formed his own band; The Black Jacks, who later played in The Casbah. Chas Newby joined the group, as did Ken Brown, but only after he had left The Quarrymen. The reason for Brown's exit from the group was that he turned up on the seventh Saturday night of The Quarrymen residency at The Casbah with the flu, so Mona ordered him upstairs to the Best's living room to rest. This caused a massive quarrel {{with the rest of}} the group when Mona came to pay them, as they wanted Brown's money to be shared amongst the three of them, as Brown had not played. Mona refused, so The Quarrymen angrily cancelled their residency and stormed out.|$|E
5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and {{it was said that}} her face had been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe. The body was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> foetal position, which suggested that the body had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and that the body could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E

5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} cannot prove which {{modes of}} catalysis {{are used by}} an enzyme. However, some kinetic data can suggest possibilities to be examined by other techniques. For example, a ping–pong mechanism with burst-phase pre-steady-state kinetics would suggest covalent catalysis might be important in this enzyme's mechanism. Alternatively, the observation of a strong pH effect on Vmax but not Km might indicate that a residue in the active site needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> particular ionisation state for catalysis to occur.|$|E
5|$|Following the deindustrialisation of Greater Manchester in the mid-20th century, {{there was}} a {{significant}} economic and population decline in the region, particularly in Manchester and Salford. Vast areas of low-quality squalid terraced housing that were built throughout the Victorian era were found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor state of repair and unsuited to modern needs; many inner-city districts suffered from chronic social deprivation and high levels of unemployment. Slum clearance and the increased building of social housing overspill estates by Salford and Manchester City Councils lead to a decrease in population in central Greater Manchester. During the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, the population of Greater Manchester declined by over 8,000inhabitants a year. While Manchester's population shrank by about 40% during this time (from 766,311 in 1931 to 452,000 in 2006), the total population of Greater Manchester decreased by only 8%.|$|E

It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> band that plays just metal music.

5|$|In late 1774, Colonial leaders {{adopted the}} Suffolk Resolves in {{resistance}} to the alterations made to the Massachusetts colonial government by the British parliament following the Boston Tea Party. The colonial assembly responded by forming a Patriot provisional government known as the Massachusetts Provincial Congress and calling for local militias to train for possible hostilities. The Colonial government exercised effective control of the colony outside of British-controlled Boston. In response, the British government in February 1775 declared Massachusetts <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of rebellion.|$|E
5|$|In the end, Emir Habibullah {{returned}} to his vacillating inactivity. He was aware the mission had found support within his council and had excited his volatile subjects. Four days after the draft treaty was signed, Habibullah called for a durbar, a grand meeting where a jihad {{was expected to be}} called. Instead, Habibullah reaffirmed his neutrality, explaining that the war's outcome was still unpredictable and that he stood for national unity. Throughout the spring of 1916, he continuously deflected the mission's overtures and gradually increased the stakes, demanding that India rise in revolution before he began his campaign. It was clear to Habibullah that for the treaty to hold any value, it required the Kaiser's signature, and that for Germany to even attempt to honour the treaty, she would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> strong position in the war. It was a good insurance policy for Habibullah.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} phase, Impetigo, the 43rd Division would move forward to relieve all Scottish {{infantry}} {{north of the}} Odon. The 15th Division would then assemble across the river and expand the bridgehead by capturing several important villages. In the final phase, codenamed Goitre, elements of the 43rd Division would cross the river to hold the area taken, while the 15th Division would continue to expand their bridgehead. The 11th Armoured Division would attempt to force a crossing over the River Orne and advance on their final objective of Bretteville-sur-Laize. The 4th Armoured Brigade, although attached to the 11th Armoured Division, was restricted to operations between the Odon and Orne to protect the Corps flank and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position to attack westwards or towards Caen, as necessary.|$|E
