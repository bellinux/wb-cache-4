Several schemes {{have been proposed}} to reduce the delay, but throughput {{is limited by the}} scheduling performance. TATD-MAC introduced in this paper improves the throughput by improving the channel utilization with a traffic-adaptive <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> scheduling <b>method.</b> The proposed traffic-adaptive <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> scheduling algorithm first avoids assigning <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> to nodes with no traffic through fast traffic notification.

The two-phase design by decomposing traffic notification and data transmission scheduling into two phases leads each phase to be simple and efficient.

40|$|AbstractIn {{digital video}} {{broadcasting}} and return channel via satellite (DVB-RCS) systems, the <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> location assigned to a given traffic in multiple frequency-time division multiple access (MF-TDMA) frame has significant effects upon the traffic delay performance. This article proposes models to analyze the relationships among frame length, bandwidth assignment (assigned <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> count), <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> location in frame, and traffic delay performance for traffics of constant bit rate (CBR) and variable bit rate (VBR). From the proposed models, {{it is found that}} the <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> location plays a leading role in affecting the traffic delay performance, which ameliorates more when the <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> location is more uniform in frame. Compared with the traditional mode of consecutive <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> allocation, the mode of uniform <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> allocation can effectually reduce the average delay and jitter, which will not vary with the frame length. Furthermore, with the mode of uniform <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> allocation increasing bandwidth assignment could promote the delay performance more effectually. This article also puts forward a practical <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> uniform allocation <b>method</b> (TUAM), which is based on the DVB-RCS standard and compatible with it. The computer simulation, apart from testifying to the validity of the model, shows that it leads to efficacious reduction of the mean traffic delay and jitter. By adopting the method, the real-time traffic-like voice over IP (VoIP) traffic's packets will not suffer from dropping due to an overlong end-to-end delay, thus improving quality of service (QoS) provision for real-time traffics in DVB-RCS systems...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{problems}} {{to be addressed in}} wireless sensor networks is the issues related to cross layer communication. Cross layer architecture shares the information across the layer, ensuring Quality of Services (QoS). With this shared information, MAC protocol adapts effective functionality maintenance such as route selection on changeable sensor network environment. However, <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> assignment and neighbour route selection time duration for cross layer have not been carried out. The time varying physical layer communication over cross layer causes high traffic load in the sensor network. Though, the traffic load was reduced using cross layer optimization procedure, the computational cost is high. To improve communication efficacy in the sensor network, a self-determined <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> based Cross-Layered Neighbour Route Discovery (C-LNRD) method is presented in this paper. In the presented work, the initial process is to discover the route in the sensor network using Dynamic Source Routing based Medium Access Control (MAC) sub layers. This process considers MAC layer operation with dynamic route neighbour table discovery. Then, the discovered route path for packet communication employs Broad Route Distributed <b>Time</b> <b>Slot</b> Assignment <b>method</b> on Cross-Layered Sensor Network system. Broad Route means <b>time</b> <b>slotting</b> on varying length of the route paths. During packet communication in this sensor network, transmission of packets is adjusted over the different time with varying ranges for controlling the traffic rate. Finally, Rayleigh fading model is developed in C-LNRD to identify the performance of the sensor network communication structure. The main task of Rayleigh Fading is to measure the power level of each communication under MAC sub layer. The minimized power level helps to easily reduce the computational cost of packet communication in the sensor network. Experiments are conducted on factors such as power factor, on packet communication, neighbour route discovery time, and information (i. e., packet) propagation speed...|$|R

The boundary of each timeslot would not coincide in one physical frame {{period in the}} received sampled signal of the same carrier coming from different cells. Hence, the detection for every timeslot power must perform sliding widow detection in a burst over one timeslot period. Moreover, parallel detecting using nine groups of training sequence code for every time-delay signal is to detect whether this timeslot exists in traffic occupancy and also to detect the corresponding training sequence code of maximum correlative power signal when timeslot is existing in traffic occupancy.

30|$|As a {{promising}} {{technology in the}} context of m-health and e-medical, wireless body area networks (WBANs) have a stringent requirement in terms of transmission reliability. Meanwhile, the wireless channel in WBANs is prone to deep fading due to multiple reasons, such as shadowing by the body, reflection, diffraction, and interference. To meet the challenge in transmission reliability, the dynamic <b>slot</b> scheduling (DSS) <b>methods</b> have attracted considerable interest in recent years. DSS method does not require extra hardware or software overhead on the sensor side. Instead, the hub optimizes the time-division multiple access slots by selecting the best permutation {{at the beginning of each}} superframe to improve the transmission reliability. However, most existing DSS works optimize the <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> scheduling based on a two-state (“good” or “bad”) Markov channel model, which is insufficient for human daily life scenarios with a variety of irregular activities. In this paper, we first collect the channel gain data in the real human daily scenarios and analyze the autocorrelation of wireless channels based on this real database. Motivated by the significant temporal autocorrelation, we then propose a new DSS method, which applies a temporal autocorrelation model to predict the channel condition for future <b>time</b> <b>slots.</b> The new <b>method</b> is designed to be compatible with IEEE 802.15. 6 standard.
