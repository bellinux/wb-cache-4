5|$|Passive linear {{electronic}} analogue {{filters are}} those filters {{which can be}} described with linear differential equations (linear); they are composed of capacitors, inductors and, sometimes, resistors (passive) and are designed to operate on continuously varying (analogue) signals. There are many linear filters which are not analogue in implementation (digital filter), {{and there are many}} electronic filters which may not have a passive topology both of which may have the same transfer function of <b>the</b> <b>filters</b> described in this article. Analogue filters are most often used in wave filtering applications, that is, where it is required to pass particular frequency components and to reject others from analogue (continuous-time) signals.|$|E

50|$|Backwashing of {{granular}} media filters involves several steps. First, <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> {{is taken}} off {{line and the}} water is drained to a level that is above the surface of <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> bed. Next, compressed air is pushed up through <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> material causing <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> bed to expand breaking up <b>the</b> compacted <b>filter</b> bed and forcing the accumulated particles into suspension. After the air scour cycle, clean backwash water is forced upwards through <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> bed continuing <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> bed expansion and carrying the particles in suspension into backwash troughs suspended above <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> surface. In some applications, air and water streams are simultaneously pushed upwards through the granular media followed by a rinse water wash. Backwashing continues for a fixed time, or until the turbidity of the backwash water is below an established value. At {{the end of the}} backwash cycle, the upward flow of water is terminated and <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> bed settles by gravity into its initial configuration. Water to be filtered is then applied to <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> surface until <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> clogs and <b>the</b> backwash cycle needs to be repeated.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>filters</b> were {{designed}} by Campbell {{for the purpose of}} separating multiplexed telephone channels on transmission lines, but their subsequent use has been much more widespread than that. The design techniques used by Campbell have largely been superseded. However, the ladder topology used by Campbell with the constant k is still in use today with implementations of modern filter designs such as the Tchebyscheff filter. Campbell gave constant k designs for low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters. Band-stop and multiple band filters are also possible.|$|E
5|$|The second version, with blue-green filters {{over the}} projectors, was trialled {{on board the}} {{corvette}} HMCS Chambly in May 1941. This gave better results as <b>the</b> <b>filters</b> removed the reddish bias to the lamps when at low intensity (lower colour temperature). The supports too were retractable, so the delicate projectors could be stowed away for protection when not in use. This second version reduced Chambly's visibility by 50% in most conditions, and sometimes {{by as much as}} 75%. This was enough to justify development of a more robust version.|$|E
5|$|Early {{stripline}} directly coupled resonator filters were end-coupled, but {{the length}} was reduced and the compactness successively increased {{with the introduction}} of parallel-coupled line filters, interdigital filters, and comb-line filters. Much of this work was published by the group at Stanford led by George Matthaei, and also including Leo Young mentioned above, in a landmark book which still today serves as a reference for circuit designers. The hairpin filter was first described in 1972. By the 1970s, most of the filter topologies in common use today had been described. More recent research has concentrated on new or variant mathematical classes of <b>the</b> <b>filters,</b> such as pseudo-elliptic, while still using the same basic topologies, or with alternative implementation technologies such as suspended stripline and finline.|$|E

5|$|Gases {{from the}} furnace are cleaned using {{selective}} non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), spray absorbers and active carbon injection. These processes remove nitrogen oxides, acidic gasses, dioxins and heavy metals from the plants emissions. The remaining gases are passed through fine-fabric bag filters to remove and solid particles, {{before it is}} released from the chimney. Each incineration line has its own independent stack in the chimney, and the flue gases are continuously monitored before being released. This information is relayed to the control room. The remaining fly ash from <b>the</b> <b>filters</b> contains particles from the incineration, lime from the spray absorbers, salt and carbon dust, and so is stored in a sealed silo until it is taken from the site for disposal. Incinerator bottom ash left on the incineration grate after the burning is moved by converyor to a bunker. Whilst on the conveyor, a magnet removes ferrous metal from the ash for recycling. The remaining ash is then used as an aggregate in the construction industry.|$|E
5|$|Gradually, the low {{frequency}} active RC filter was supplanted by the switched-capacitor filter that operated in the discrete time domain {{rather than the}} continuous time domain. All of these filter technologies require precision components for high performance filtering, and that often requires that <b>the</b> <b>filters</b> be tuned. Adjustable components are expensive, and the labor to do the tuning can be significant. Tuning the poles and zeros of a 7th-order elliptic filter {{is not a simple}} exercise. Integrated circuits have made digital computation inexpensive, so now {{low frequency}} filtering is done with digital signal processors. Such digital filters have no problem implementing ultra-precise (and stable) values, so no tuning or adjustment is required. Digital filters also don't have to worry about stray coupling paths and shielding the individual filter sections from one another. One downside is the digital signal processing may consume much more power than an equivalent LC filter. Inexpensive digital technology has largely supplanted analogue implementations of filters. However, there is still an occasional place for them in the simpler applications such as coupling where sophisticated functions of frequency are not needed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>filters</b> {{designed}} by Campbell were named wave filters {{because of their}} property of passing some waves and strongly rejecting others. The method by which they were designed was called the image parameter method and filters designed to this method are called image filters. The image method essentially consists of developing the transmission constants of an infinite chain of identical filter sections and then terminating the desired finite number of filter sections in the image impedance. This exactly corresponds {{to the way the}} properties of a finite length of transmission line are derived from the theoretical properties of an infinite line, the image impedance corresponding to the characteristic impedance of the line.|$|E

5|$|The {{procedures}} {{used in the}} previous tests were repeated, {{but this time the}} winch cable snagged, and the test samples had to be retrieved by a jeep, exposing its crew to more radiation. The Los Alamos personnel assigned to remove <b>the</b> <b>filters</b> from the B-17 drones had apparently carried out the procedure on X-Ray and Yoke without problems, but this time three of them suffered radiation burns on their hands serious enough to be hospitalized and need skin grafting. One of the men who had carried out the procedure for Yoke was then also found to have burns on his hands and was hospitalized too, but was discharged on 28 May. Once again the drone tank gave trouble, and bogged in the crater, but the soil samples were retrieved by the backup drone tank. Both tanks were subsequently dumped in the ocean.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> loop <b>filter</b> {{works like}} a {{low-pass}} filter, and its response to signal dynamics is determined by <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> order and bandwidth. In {{order to reduce the}} noise in <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> output, <b>the</b> bandwidth (or the cut-off frequency for a low-pass filter) has to be narrower (or lower) to attenuate high-frequency components in <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> input. In return for the noise reduction, the dynamic range of <b>the</b> loop <b>filter</b> becomes lower as the bandwidth gets narrower. <b>The</b> <b>filter</b> output also suffers from the steady-state error if the order of the input signal dynamics is equal to, or higher than, <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> order.
