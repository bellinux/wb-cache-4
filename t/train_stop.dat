5|$|Caldas da Rainha has {{a railway}} station {{served by the}} Linha do Oeste (western line) of Comboios de Portugal. Regional trains, which make {{frequent}} local stops, run south to Lisbon, to its suburbs, or to Torres Vedras, and north to Leiria. Interregional trains, which make select stops, run north to Coimbra via Leiria. Salir do Porto, a civil parish on the Atlantic Ocean, is the next station north of Caldas and the only other active <b>train</b> <b>stop</b> in the municipality. Former train stops in the municipality are Campo–Serra and Bouro.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the rest of Tasmania, Whitemore no longer has {{passenger}} rail transport; the last Tasmanian passenger rail service stopped in 1978 and the service to Whitemore prior to that. Rail transport for Whitemore opened in the late 1870s. The first passenger train was on 27 April 1870 and the rail line opened for regular traffic in February 1871. This transport was from a siding rather than a station. The Whitemore siding did not have a full-time station master and was not a regular stop; passengers had to request the <b>train</b> <b>stop</b> or flag the train for a pickup. The town’s only regular transport services as of 2014 are Redline Coaches' private school-bus services.|$|E
5|$|The Holborn rail crash {{occurred}} on the Central line at Holborn on 9 July 1980, at about 13:28 and involved two 1962 stock trains. The 13:17 train from Liverpool Street to White City, standing at the westbound platform, was run into by the 12:49 Hainault to Ealing Broadway train. The rear train was slowing after its brakes had been applied by the emergency <b>train</b> <b>stop</b> system because it had passed two signals at danger, but it failed to stop in time to avoid collision. The driver of the rear train and 20 passengers were injured. An inquiry concluded that the accident {{was caused by the}} driver failing to control his train. Disruption of services occurred until the following morning.|$|E

5|$|The trains {{were put}} back into service on 13 July. The trains were only allowed {{to operate at}} {{conventional}} speeds and {{had to go through}} a weekly inspection. At the same time, NSB removed the surcharge on the Signatur services. NSB stated that they were considering revocation the purchase of the four trains which were still to be delivered. In addition to problems with axles, there were also issues with the braking and air conditioning systems. In mid-August, the tilting mechanism was disabled on all the trains because of a fault in a bearing in the connection between the bogie and the body which allowed for a movement of several millimetres (at least 0.1 in). In late August, problems occurred with the braking system causing the trains to automatically brake even when not receiving such signals from the automatic <b>train</b> <b>stop</b> system.|$|E
5|$|On 28 October 1999, Minister of Transport Dag Jostein Fjærvoll {{asked the}} {{directors}} of the three involved parties, Osmund Ueland of NSB, Sverre Quale of the inspectorate and Steinar Killi of the National Rail Administration, to meet at his office the following day if the issue was not resolved. The following day, the inspectorate gave permission for the trains to be taken into use, despite noting a series of non-conformities with safety regulations: the inspectorate lacked a list of the train's deviations from the safety regulations; lack of a system to automatically monitor the speed of the trains, particularly when automatic <b>train</b> <b>stop</b> was disconnected; lack of safety training for the crew; lack of an evacuation analysis; and lack of control of the marking of safety equipment. Most of the deviations were to be followed up within two weeks. Quale stated that the deviated issues were of a nature which had not previously been applied to trains and that it was therefore not critical.|$|E

25|$|Serpico (1973), with Al Pacino, {{had several}} scenes filmed in Astoria. For example, the {{elevated}} <b>train</b> <b>stop</b> at Ditmars Boulevard was the location for a chase scene, and Serpico has a clandestine meeting in Astoria Park under the Hellgate Bridge.|$|E
25|$|The station {{building}} was renovated in the 1970s in a brutal fashion which eliminated {{many of the}} original architectural interior elements. Particularly the entrances and the central hall received contemporary elements, such as an aluminum shell. The roof ornaments were not demolished but simply covered. Automatic <b>train</b> <b>stop</b> was installed on 1 November 1983. The station park was renovated in 1990.|$|E
25|$|When a train {{stopped at}} a red stop signal, its {{presence}} on the track started a time delay relay. At {{the conclusion of the}} time delay, the red marker light was extinguished and replaced by the miniature yellow (the upper red aspect remained lit). The <b>train</b> <b>stop</b> also lowered. The calling on aspect authorised the driver to proceed, but to be prepared to stop short of another train.|$|E

25|$|Automatic <b>train</b> <b>stop</b> was {{introduced}} on 30 December 1986. During the late 1980s, El17 locomotives were introduced, but they proved unreliable and {{were taken out}} of service after 1998, {{with the introduction of}} El18. In 1991, four Class 69 units were introduced on trains between Egersund and Stavanger, and in 1994, two renovated Class 69 units were moved from Eastern Norway and put into service between Kristiansand and Stavanger. The Scanet train radio system was installed between 1993 and 1996.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} railway line {{along the}} shore of Mjøsa opened {{as part of the}} segment from Eidsvoll to Hamar on 8 November 1880. The single track segment received electric traction on 15 June 1953, centralized traffic control on 22 March 1965 and automatic <b>train</b> <b>stop</b> on 1 November 1983. The Ulvin area received a station, at first named Ulvin and later Morskogen. It featured a passing loop and served as a stop until 1 June 1980. The entire line from Eidsvoll to Hamar originally ran entirely without tunnels.|$|E
25|$|A dual-gauge {{system was}} {{established}} between Eidanger and Larvik on 22 June 1940, which remained until 15 February 1941, when only standard gauge was {{used on the}} Vestfold Line until Larvik. Eidanger Station was electrified along with the Brevik Line and the Bratsberg Line south of Borgestad Station on 19 July 1949. The section east of Eidanger on the Vestfold Line was electrified on 15 October 1956. The line past Eidanger was remote controlled from 20 December 1972. The station was closed for passenger trains on 2 March 1987, although it remained in use as a passing loop. The station received automatic <b>train</b> <b>stop</b> on 18 July 1990.|$|E

On the Tōkaidō Shinkansen, Nozomi <b>trains</b> <b>stop</b> at Tokyo Station, Shinagawa Station, Shin-Yokohama Station, Nagoya Station, Kyoto Station, and Shin-Ōsaka Station. On the Sanyō Shinkansen, all Nozomi <b>trains</b> <b>stop</b> at Shin-Kobe Station, Okayama Station, Hiroshima Station, Kokura Station, and Hakata Station, but certain <b>trains</b> <b>stop</b> at additional stations as well.

25|$|Blommenholm wad {{degraded}} {{to a halt}} on 1 February 1969 and {{was subsequently}} no longer manned. A major upgrade to the service came in 1973. New Class 69 trains were put into service. Along with the closing of some stations, it allowed travel time to Oslo to drop from 22 to 12 minutes. During this period the station was repeatedly subject to vandalism, especially {{the breaking of the}} windows. In 1983 NSB went to the step of rebuilding the platform building so it became a shed without windows. The line past Blommenholm received centralized traffic control and automatic <b>train</b> <b>stop</b> on 3 December 1992.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{have focused}} on {{speeding}} by the 23-year-old driver, Ryūjirō Takami (who was among the dead), as being the most likely cause of the derailment. 25 minutes before the derailment, Takami had run a red light, causing the automatic <b>train</b> <b>stop</b> (ATS) to bring the train to a halt. The train had also overshot the correct stopping position at an earlier stop at Itami Station, requiring him {{to back up the}} train, and resulting in a 90-second delay, about 4 minutes before the disaster. By the time the train passed Tsukaguchi Station at a speed of 120 km/h, the delay had been reduced to 60 seconds.|$|E
25|$|The {{system was}} finally {{identified}} for replacement following an accident at Kensal Green, when a main line train {{ran into the}} back of Bakerloo Line train. The driver had apparently mistaken the calling on aspect for a normal yellow aspect (the signal was temporarily operating on a maximum yellow due to track side work). The indications were that the driver was distracted as his pay slip and its envelope were recovered from the wreckage – but this was never proved as the cause. It was also suggested that the driver may not even have checked the indications having observed the fall of the <b>train</b> <b>stop.</b> The entire line was resignalled to the standard colour light system in 1988.|$|E
