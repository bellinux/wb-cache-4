40|$|The {{concept of}} {{equivalence}} has {{for many years}} attracted attention of researchers in variousdisciplines: from mathematics to philosophy to translation theory to terminology. This thesisintends to survey the concept of equivalence in three subject fields all of which focus onlanguages and communication, namely: translation theory, lexicography and terminology. Thepurpose of the paper is twofold: to investigate the theoretical grounds of equivalence in thesethree disciplines and to survey the methods and practices of establishing equivalence inmultilingual terminology work. The results of the theoretical investigation are summed up onthe basis of the <b>terminological</b> concept <b>analysis.</b> Four concepts systems are structured andpresented {{in the form of}} concept diagrams (two for translation theory, one for lexicography andone for terminology). The concept systems give an overview of the current understanding ofequivalence in the three subject fields and expose the relations between equivalence and anumber of related concepts. The central theoretical question of the thesis whether equivalencecould be considered the same concept in all three disciplines is answered on the basis of theresults of the <b>terminological</b> concept <b>analysis.</b> The empirical investigation is carried out in theform of case studies in the frame of multilingual terminology work. It focuses on the problemsof establishing equivalence, of determining the degree of equivalence {{as well as on the}} methodsand practices of presenting equivalents in various terminological resources...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} {{combined}} taxonomic-frames approach to terminological verb collocations considered within the broad category of terminological units. The latest approaches to terminology are briefly reviewed. Special {{attention is paid}} to the methodology of frame-based terminology, emphasizing its appropriateness for analyzing that type of collocations. The concept designated by the term in the collocation is assumed to be the Patient in a dynamic scene whereas the verb designates a dynamic action/process affecting it with a consequent Result. To perform the frame semantic analysis of the scenes, it is deemed necessary to first categorize those event structures into conceptual groups according to the type of Agent and Result. Such a preliminary taxonomic analysis is required to make the overall analytical procedure more explicit and applicable in a subsequent <b>terminological</b> contrastive <b>analysis</b> involved in multilingual terminological projects. The analytical procedures are exemplified with the term "steel‟ and its verb collocators...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background There are {{numerous}} definitions of General Practice and Family Medicine (GP/FM) and Primary Health Care (PHC), but {{the distinction between}} the two concepts is unclear. Aim To conduct a <b>terminological</b> <b>analysis</b> of a set of definitions of GP/FM and of PHC, to clarify what binds and what distinguishes these two concepts. Design The terms of 20 definitions were collected in two bags of words (one for GP/FM and one for PHC terms). A <b>terminological</b> <b>analysis</b> of these two bags of words was performed to prioritize the terms and analyze their world of reference. Methods The two collected bags of words were extracted with Vocabgrabber®, configured in two term butts using Wordle®, and further explored for similarities using Tropes®. The prioritized terms were analyzed using the Aristotelian approach to categorization of things. Results Although continuity of care (with person-centered approach and shared decision making) is the central issue of the two sets, the two sets of definitions differ greatly in content. The prioritized terms specific to GP/FM (community, medicine, responsibility, individual, problem, needs, [...] .) are different from prioritized terms specific to PHC (home, team, promotion, collaborator, engagement, neighborhood, medical center…). Conclusion <b>Terminological</b> <b>analysis</b> of the definitions for GP/FM and PHC shows two entities which are overlapping but distinct, necessitating a different taxonomic approach and different bibliographic search strategies.

40|$|International audienceThree {{types of}} {{information}} categories are proposed in a learner‟s glossary entry: conceptual, lexical and pragmatic. The glossary is envisaged as a knowledge-oriented terminological collection which provides quick access to the conceptual structure of a narrow domain, the head terms functioning in it, their definitions, collocations, translations and contextual use. The conceptual information is identified by analyzing the conceptual relations using a classification scheme of the general aspects of the basic concept (top term). The top-down procedure continues with establishing the system-structuring characteristics with possible graphic representation of types. The lexical information refers to terminological collocations identified by a lexico-semantic analysis.

On these grounds, an experiment has been conducted with fourth-year students of the translation course at the Scuola Superiore di Lingue Moderne per Interpreti e Traduttori of the University of Trieste to ascertain whether terminological products can also be of service in the preliminary stage of translation, i. e. in message decoding through text analysis. A model of <b>terminological</b> text <b>analysis</b> for the purposes of specialised translation was devised and a group of students was asked to adopt it for the experiment, while a control group of students was given a list of translation equivalents and was allowed to use other reference material.

40|$|AbstractSome modern Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) {{architectures}} {{and standards}} {{are based on}} the dual model-based architecture, which defines two conceptual levels: reference model and archetype model. Such architectures represent EHR domain knowledge by means of archetypes, which are considered by many researchers to play a fundamental role for the achievement of semantic interoperability in healthcare. Consequently, formal methods for validating archetypes are necessary. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in exploring how semantic web technologies in general, and ontologies in particular, can facilitate the representation and management of archetypes, including binding to terminologies, but no solution based on such technologies has been provided to date to validate archetypes. Our approach represents archetypes by means of OWL ontologies. This permits to combine the two levels of the dual model-based architecture in one modeling framework which can also integrate terminologies available in OWL format. The validation method consists of reasoning on those ontologies to find modeling errors in archetypes: incorrect restrictions over the reference model, non-conformant archetype specializations and inconsistent terminological bindings. The archetypes available in the repositories supported by the openEHR Foundation and the NHS Connecting for Health Program, which are the two largest publicly available ones, have been analyzed with our validation method. For such purpose, we have implemented a software tool called Archeck. Our results show that around 1 / 5 of archetype specializations contain modeling errors, the most common mistakes being related to coded terms and <b>terminological</b> bindings. The <b>analysis</b> of each repository reveals that different patterns of errors are found in both repositories. This result reinforces the need for making serious efforts in improving archetype design processes...|$|R
40|$|Investigates {{theoretical}} and practical interfaces between terminology, philosophical ontology, computational ontology and documentary linguistics and the subsidies that they offer {{for the construction of}} documentary information. It was established as specific objectives, the analysis of the production, development, implementation and use of ontologies based on the information science theories, the research on the contribution of ontologies for the development of thesauri and vice versa and the discussion of the philosophical foundation of the application of ontologies based on the study of ontological categories present in classical philosophy and in the contemporary proposals. It argues that the understanding of ontologies through the communicative theory of terminology contributes to the organization of a less quantitative access (syntactic) and more qualitative (semantic) of information. Notes that, in spite of sharing some common goals, there is little dialogue between the information science (and, inside it, the documentary linguistics) and computer science. It argues that the computational and philosophical ontologies are not completely independent events, which have among themselves only the similarity of name, and notes that the discussion of categories and categorization in computer science, does not always have the emphasis it receives in information science in studies on knowledge representation. The approach of Deleuze and Guattari's rhizome, was treated as instigator of reflections on the validity of the hierarchical tree model structure and the possibilities of its expansion. It concludes that the construction of ontologies can not ignore the <b>terminological</b> and conceptual <b>analysis,</b> as it's understood by the terminology and by the information science accumulated in the {{theoretical and}} methodological basis for the construction of indexing languages and, on the other hand, the construction of flexible indexing languages can not ignore the representational model of ontologies which are more capable for formalization and interoperability...|$|R

40|$|The present {{work offers}} a psycho-pragmatic {{approach}} to idiom processing that has enough flexibility {{to be able}} to account for any idiom, regardless of their nature. In order to achieve it, two different views of modeling idiom processing have been combined: the Idiom Decomposition Hypothesis, proposed by Raymond W. Gibbs, Jr., and the pragmatic approach represented by Sperber and Wilson's Relevance Theory. This work is structured in six chapters. Chapter 1 offers a <b>terminological</b> and typological <b>analysis</b> of the most common terms used to define idioms. This analysis highlights the vagueness with which the different terms are used. Thus, the definition and the typology proposed for idioms {{at the end of the}} chapter are only based on pragmatic criteria. Chapter 2 reviews the psycholinguistic models of idiom processing, carrying out a more specific analysis of Gibbs's model than of the rest. Chapter 3 analyzes the main ideas of Relevance Theory. Chapter 4 is divided into two parts. The first one deals with which idioms communicate explicitly and implicitly. The second part tackles the uses that speakers of a language make of idioms: descriptive use [...] -when the concept communicated by the speaker is identical to the one encoded by the idiom [...] -and interpretative and/or metalinguistic use [...] -when the concept of the idiom the speaker communicates resembles semantically and/or formally the one encoded by the idiom. Chapter 5 focuses on the concepts underlying idioms, which reveals that idioms make immediately accessible sets of stereotypical assumptions whose number varies depending on their degree of lexicalization. Those sets of assumptions are the point of departure for the creation of an ad hoc concept in all cases, except when the lexicalized concept underlying the idiom coincides with the one encoded by the expression. Chapter 6 accounts for the representation of idioms in the mind, following the Sperberian distinction between intuitive and reflective concepts. This analysis leads me to the conclusion that idiom processing requires not only conceptual information but also procedural information that constrains the way in which that conceptual information is combined. 500 p...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} the present study is Hegel’s {{conception}} of the symbolic form of art, as it is described in Hegel’s Lectures on the Philosophy of Art.  I will focus on the problem of the symbolic form of art in order to highlight its essential traits and to define the role it plays in the development of art. Hegel gave a series of lectures on the philosophy of art in several university terms (in 1820 / 21, 1823, 1826 and 1828 / 29), but never published a book of his own on this topic. In order to highlight the peculiarities of Hegel’s mature conception of symbolic art, I will read transcripts of Hegel's lectures made by his students, the §§ 556 – 63 of the Encyclopaedia (1830) and some Hegel’s reviews published by him on magazines. In order to point out the development of Hegel's conception of symbol and symbolic art, I will also contemplate the notions of art and symbol in some texts dated from his period in Jena, Nürnberg and Heidelberg.   The first chapter is devoted to recreate the specific background in which Hegel develops his conception of art. More specifically, I will offer a <b>terminological</b> and historic-philosophical <b>analysis</b> of the concepts of art and symbol, which characterize Germany {{during the early years of}} the 19 th century.   The second chapter is dedicated to the concept of symbol. In this chapter I will first analyze the concept of symbol which Hegel presents in the Encyclopaedia’s section devoted to the Psychology. Then I will focus on the properties that Hegel confers to the symbol in his lectures on the philosophy of art and I will try to highlight the complexity of this concept.   In the third chapter, I will deal with the issue of the end of the symbolic art: does the symbolic art end before or after the classical art? In order to answer to this question, I will compare the creation, the contents and the fruition of the classical form of art with the creation, the contents and the fruition of the symbolic form of art. I will also try to show that Hegel doesn’t define the classical beauty as the reconciliation of figure and content.   In the last chapter I will consider the connection between Hegel’s concept of symbolic art and the human ability to break with the habits and with what is already known, and to become open to something new. ...|$|R
