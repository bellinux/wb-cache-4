40|$|Renal cells contain two corticosteroid-binding {{entities}} defined on {{the basis}} of hormone-binding selectivity as type I (mineralocorticoid) and type II (glucocorticoid). The mineralocorticoid, aldosterone can bind to both type I and type II receptors. This poses problems in defining the characteristics of a true mineralocorticoid regulated expression of specific genes. We have used chimaeric constructs bearing the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter to study aldosterone action in the feline renal cell line CRFK. We have shown that in these cells aldosterone induces MMTV transcription through its own receptor (type I). This induction of MMTV transcription by aldosterone is a primary response to the hormone. We have shown that the DNA sequences that mediate the aldosterone response overlap the hormone response element (HRE) required for the glucocorticoid, progestin, and androgen induction of transcription at the MMTV long terminal repeat region. Thus the aldosterone regulation of MMTV long terminal repeat <b>transcription</b> <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> the mode of action of the other steroid hormones at this promoter...|$|E

[...] According to Grant Palmer, Smith believed [...] "a second <b>transcription</b> would <b>be</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> the first.

40|$|A point {{mutation}} at nucleotide 5258 in the enhancer of the polyomavirus host range mutant F 441 permits productive infection of F 9 embryonal carcinoma cells, which, when undifferentiated, are refractory to infection by wild-type polyomavirus. Synthetic oligonucleotides {{were used to}} construct viral genomes containing all four possible nucleotide pairs at nucleotide 5258. While {{all four of the}} viruses infected 3 T 6 cells efficiently, only F 441, which has a guanosine in place of the wild-type adenosine in the early strand of DNA at position 5258, was able to infect F 9 cells. Transfection assays with enhancer-dependent plasmid constructs expressing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene {{under the control of the}} polyomavirus early promoter verified that only the F 441 enhancer had any significant activity in F 9 cells. DNase I footprinting showed that the F 441 mutation creates a strong binding site for purified CCAAT box <b>transcription</b> factor, which <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> nuclear factor 1. The three other mutations at nucleotide 5258 alter the affinity and the quality of factor binding at this site...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{mutations}} {{have been described}} with pleiotropic effects on the expression of genes for degradative enzymes in Bacillus subtilis. The sacU 32 (Hy) and sacQ 36 (Hy) mutations increase {{the expression of a}} wide variety of enzymes that degrade biological polymers. The phenotypes caused by mutations at the hpr locus are more restricted; they are known to increase expression of the alkaline and neutral proteases. The alkaline protease (aprE) promoter was analyzed to determine the target site for stimulation by these loci. Deletion of upstream regions of the aprE promoter could abolish or greatly reduce stimulation by mutations at these loci. A region upstream of - 200 was necessary for full stimulation by an hpr- 97 mutation, whereas a region between - 141 and - 164 was necessary for full stimulation by the sacU 32 (Hy) and sacQ 36 (Hy) mutations. Northern analyses of mRNA preparations showed that the levels of aprE mRNA were increased in strains carrying the sacU 32 (Hy) or hpr- 97 mutation. Moreover, primer extension analysis of these mRNA preparations revealed that the <b>transcription</b> start point <b>was</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> that in a wild-type strain. We hypothesize that upstream activation of the subtilisin promoter mediated by these genes is a mechanism for global responses to a variety of nutritional conditions...|$|R
40|$|Insulin gene <b>transcription</b> <b>is</b> {{a unique}} {{feature of the}} {{pancreatic}} beta cells and is increased in response to glucose. The recent cloning of insulin promoter factor 1 (IPF 1) and somatostatin transcription factor 1 (STF 1) unexpectedly revealed that these are mouse and rat homologues of the same protein mediating transactivation through binding of CT box-like elements in rat insulin 1 and somatostatin promoter/enhancer regions, respectively. By using oligonucleotides representing {{each of the three}} CT boxes of the human insulin (HI) gene enhancer and nuclear extracts from the mouse islet tumor cell lines beta TC 3 and alpha TC 1, we have identified a beta-cell-specific binding activity as reported for IPF 1, which has maximal affinity toward the CT 2 box. However, in pluripotent, HI-transfected rat islet tumor cells, NHI- 6 F, this binding activity is present prior to induction of (human) insulin gene <b>transcription.</b> Its migration <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> that of in vitro translated STF 1 in electrophoretic mobility-shift assays; it is specifically recognized by anti-STF 1 antibodies and has an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa. Mutation of the CT 2 box decreases transcriptional activity of a HI reporter plasmid by approximately 65 % in beta TC 3 cells and blocks the glucose response in isolated newborn rat islet cells. Furthermore, cotransfection with STF 1 cDNA into the glucagon-producing alpha TC 1 cells increases the activity of the HI enhancer 4 - to 5 -fold, suggesting that STF 1 /IPF 1 can confer on alpha TC 1 cells the ability to transcribe the HI gene. We conclude that STF 1 /IPF 1 is a necessary but not sufficient key regulator of insulin gene activity, possibly also involved in glucose-regulated transcription...|$|R
