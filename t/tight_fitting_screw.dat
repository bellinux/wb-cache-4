50|$|Thin film {{composites}} membranes typically {{suffer from}} compaction effects under pressure.

40|$|Ski Cross rules require loose {{garments}} {{and skin}} suits are not allowed. This {{study investigated the}} aerodynamic behaviour of flapping garments of different looseness ratios (garment length to cylinder circumference) mounted on a horizontal cylinder. Three fabrics of different roughness were tested in a wind tunnel from 20 to 140 kph. <b>Tight</b> <b>fitting</b> textiles showed the standard flow transition and critical flow regime known from smooth and rough cylinders. Flapping textiles exhibited a higher drag coefficient (on average 1. 5 {{times higher than the}} <b>tight</b> <b>fitting</b> fabrics in the subcritical regime), which decreased slightly with speed. The high drag coefficient {{can be attributed to the}} flutter amplitude which increases the wake diameter and prevents backward movement of the separation points. The looseness ratio (fineness ratio) affects the drag coefficient only marginally (drag decreases with the ratios) ...|$|R

40|$|Prepubescent {{children}} are disadvantaged when exercising in hot environments due to age and maturation related differences {{when compared to}} adults. Children produce greater metabolic heat, have a reduced sweating capacity and cardiac output and experience a greater potential for heat influx when ambient temperatures exceed that of the skin. Previous studies investigating thermoregulatory responses of prepubescent children have predominantly explored hot/dry environments with limited research in hot/humid environments or exercising in clothing under any climatic conditions. A unique situation exists for north Queensland surf lifesavers, {{in which they are}} compelled to wear full-length protective suits to prevent potentially fatal marine stinger envenomation. This research evaluates the thermoregulatory responses in situ, of prepubescent junior surf lifesavers exercising in hot and humid conditions while wearing <b>tight</b> <b>fitting</b> protective clothing. This research explores the hypothesis that thermoregulatory characteristics of prepubescent surf lifesavers increase while exercising in a hot/humid environment wearing <b>tight</b> <b>fitting</b> protective clothing...|$|R
