40|$|From the production-focused {{industrial}} {{construction in}} the 1960 s and 1970 s, the development has now led to several concepts from the manufacturing industry {{has begun to be}} applied in house building. By offering individual solutions you create problems in trying to adapt the already well standardized solutions. One method of dealing with this is through the application of mass-customization and use of product configurators. To investigate the use of product configurators for building elements this study has been conducted that has the objective to investigate the possibility of developing a product configurator for <b>bathroom</b> <b>floors.</b> This was performed through a case study with the goal of producing a configurator for <b>bathroom</b> <b>floors.</b> <b>The</b> results of the case study were then compared against traditionally drawing <b>bathroom</b> <b>floor</b> designs in two different CAD software for the building industry and the results from it formed the basis for examining the profitability. The results showed {{that it is possible to}} develop a configurator for <b>bathroom</b> <b>floors</b> that meet <b>the</b> requirements and which can produce finished drawings required by the user. Furthermore, it was shown that the long development time along with the relatively short time-savings at the drawing of <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>floors</b> created a low profitability of the configurator.

500|$|A few critics {{suggested}} {{freedom as}} a theme {{in light of}} the importance shown by the characters to it. True to its title, which is a Romani word for freedom, [...] Gatlif used his freedom to direct a tangential, poignant romantic story with the historical documents available to him, unlike other movies with similar themes, remarked Jacques Mandelbaum at Le Monde. The Village Voice review declared that it is [...] "a magnificent paean to the mad ecstasy of freedom". The Arizona Reporter review added that, for the Romani, freedom means [...] "being able to keep in motion, that is, the journey, not the destination, is the reward". It observed the importance the characters give to freedom, citing the scene where Taloche becomes concerned that water is being [...] "held against its will" [...] in the taps, and [...] "releases" [...] it to overflow the sink onto <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>floor,</b> and then the stairs, with Taloche blissfully sliding down the stairs as if he were on a Disney ride. Alexis Campion at Le Journal du Dimanche remarked that Gatlif has refreshingly portrayed the Romani as [...] "free-spirited" [...] characters and added that this historic film is a tribute to those free souls who take to the streets even today. The Télérama review was of the opinion that the movie runs out of steam during the scenes depicting historic events, but gains momentum in the forests and on the roads, where its characters' passion for freedom, and hence Lavoine's and Croze's characters, get sidelined by that of Thierrée's, with his St. Vitus' dance and Dostoyevsky-like ruminations. It added that Taloche is the true [...] "incarnation" [...] of freedom.|$|E
500|$|Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV had a {{generally}} mixed to positive {{perspective on the}} episode, expressing hope in its further development. Although originally criticizing the predictability of the event, Dahl noted an [...] "undeniable sense of originality", deeming the episode a portal to the series becoming [...] "a medical chick flick, but a damn good one". Highly praising the [...] "big and attractive" [...] cast, Dahl positively received {{the interaction between the}} characters, noting the [...] "smart" [...] dialogue that helps each character evolve. However, Dahl expressed disappointment in the over emotional scenes, describing them as [...] "off-putting" [...] and [...] "not believable", while comparing them to real life interactions between people who emote in a more sublte manner than displayed on television. [...] "Emotions ran high in the premiere and there was much crying", stated Dahl, but noted that the dialogue, who he had previously been worried would be [...] "too cutesy", was not bothering, and rather realistic, noting how the show is [...] "smartly written". He also described the Pompeo and Heigl's as [...] "worthy of attention". After the episode's broadcast, Robert Rorke of the New York Post deemed Stevens [...] "the heart and soul" [...] of the series, due to the episode mostly focusing on the events that come to define her as a person. Rorke named her the show's heroine, and wrote that [...] "Izzie is a welcome, calming presence, despite the devastation she experienced when she failed to save her patient and fiance Denny Duquette", considering her to have been more prominent than the title character, Grey, whose storyline received negative critiques: [...] "She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmeas. But lately, she's been a little dopey, with that endless McDreamy soliloquies." [...] Abigail Chao of Television Without Pity had a positive outlook on the episode. She praised the storyline of Izzie lying on <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>floor,</b> describing at as [...] "a perfect opportunity for flashbacks", which proved the strong friendship the five interns share. Montgomery's reaction to the discovery of Grey's underwear was deemed by Chao [...] "hilarious", whereas Bailey's interaction with the quarantined patient was described as [...] "touching". [...] "Now it's Meredith's turn to be feckless and indecisive", stated Chao, noting the lack of realism in Grey's love triangle with Shepherd and Dandridge. However, she praised the interaction of the three characters, who she deemed [...] "lovely adolescents".|$|E

Reading a magazine story about a woman's struggle with an eating disorder prompted Barlow to follow the same path. She ate very little and worked out [...] "for {{two or three hours}} per day".

2500|$|Vélez's {{death was}} recounted in the 1959 book Hollywood Babylon by Kenneth Anger. In Anger's retelling, Vélez planned {{to stage a}} {{beautiful}} suicide scene atop her satin bed, but the Seconal she took did not mix well with the [...] "Mexi-Spice Last Supper" [...] that she had eaten earlier that evening. As a result, Anger said she became violently ill. Instead of dying on her bed as planned, Anger claimed that a dazed Vélez stumbled {{to the bathroom to}} vomit, slipped on <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>floor</b> tile and fell head first into the toilet, where she subsequently drowned. Anger claimed that Vélez's [...] "chambermaid" [...] Juanita found her mistress the next morning. Despite the fact that Anger's version of events contradicts published reports and the official ruling, his story became something of an urban legend and is often repeated as fact - it was recounted in the pilot episode of the television comedy series Frasier. Vélez's biographer, Michelle Vogel, points out {{that it would have been}} [...] "virtually impossible" [...] for Vélez to have [...] "stumbled to the bathroom" [...] or even get off her bed after having consumed such a large amount of Seconal. Seconal is noted for being fast acting even in small doses and Vélez's death was likely instantaneous. Her death certificate lists [...] "Seconal poisoning" [...] due to [...] "ingestion of Seconal" [...] as the cause of death, not drowning. Further, there was also no evidence to suggest Vélez had vomited.|$|E
