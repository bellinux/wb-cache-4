5|$|Initially, Northumberland's {{relations}} with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>great</b> northern family, the Nevilles, were friendly. He was already {{connected to the}} Beaufort-Nevilles through his marriage with Eleanor Neville, and in 1426 he married his sister Elizabeth to the young Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland. In the early 1440s, Northumberland was involved in other disputes. A conflict over land with the Archbishop of York escalated into open violence. The king intervened on the archbishop's side, though Northumberland remained in favour at court. Nevertheless, he spent less time involved in central affairs at Westminster in the later 1440s.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>Great</b> Powers {{immediately}} {{rejected the}} treaty {{out of fear}} that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the subsequent Treaty of Berlin, signed on 13 July, which provided for a much smaller state comprising Moesia and the region of Sofia, leaving large populations of Bulgarians outside the new country. This {{played a significant role in}} forming Bulgaria's militaristic approach to foreign affairs during the first half of the 20th century.|$|E

All of the Greats do this, except for one woman. We then find out that the Last Great and this woman have plotted to have <b>the</b> <b>others</b> release themselves and float around as formless energy so that they can enact a master plan that they have been planning for some time.|$|R
5|$|ML {{contracted}} Cammell Laird of Birkenhead {{to build}} two smaller vessels of 1,800 tons. Commissioned in 1952, they were named the Manchester Pioneer and Explorer. They {{were joined by}} the secondhand 1,400-ton Manchester Prospector. The trio were {{the first of a}} size able to pass through the restricted-size canals and locks leading directly to Toronto and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>Great</b> Lakes ports as far as Detroit, Michigan. This initiative, the first by a British line, and taken well ahead of the 1959 completion of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, gave the line a head start in the direct trade to the Midwest ports. During the winter months, when thick ice prevented navigation on the lakes, the trio were employed elsewhere, sometimes on charter to other lines.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans live a more solitary {{lifestyle}} than <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>great</b> apes. Most social bonds {{occur between}} adult females and their dependent and weaned offspring. Adult males and independent adolescents {{of both sexes}} tend to live alone. Orangutan societies {{are made up of}} resident and transient individuals of both sexes. Resident females live with their offspring in defined home ranges that overlap with those of other adult females, which may be their immediate relatives. One to several resident female home ranges are encompassed within the home range of a resident male, who is their main mating partner.|$|E
5|$|Systematizing, naming and {{classifying}} dominated {{natural history}} {{throughout much of}} the 17th and 18th centuries. Carl Linnaeus published a basic taxonomy for the natural world in 1735 (variations of which have been in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced scientific names for all his species. While Linnaeus conceived of species as unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>great</b> naturalist of the 18th century, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of common descent. Though he was opposed to evolution, Buffon is a key figure in the history of evolutionary thought; his work would influence the evolutionary theories of both Lamarck and Darwin.|$|E

5|$|The landed {{aristocracy}} of Spanish descent {{considered the}} illiterate, mixed-race gauchos, who comprised {{the majority of}} the population, to be ungovernable and untrustworthy. The gauchos were tolerated because there was no other labor force available, but were treated with contempt by the landowners. Rosas got along well with the gauchos in his service, despite his harsh and authoritarian comportment. He was known to dress like them, joke with them, take part in their horse-play, and pay them well, but he never allowed them to forget that he was their master rather than their equal. Shaped by the colonial society in which he lived, Rosas was conservative, an advocate of hierarchy and authority, like <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>great</b> landowners in the region.|$|E
5|$|Until the Taung childthe 2.8 million-year-old {{remains of}} an Australopithecus africanuswere {{discovered}} in South Africa in 1924, Dubois's and Koenigswald's discoveries were the oldest hominid remains ever found. Some scientists {{of the day}} suggested that Dubois's Java Man was a potential intermediate form between modern humans and the common ancestor we share with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>great</b> apes. This supposition has been confirmed, but the current consensus of anthropologists is that the direct ancestors of modern humans were African populations of Homo erectus (possibly Homo ergaster), rather than the Asian populations {{of the same species}} exemplified by Java Man and Peking Man.|$|E
5|$|With {{the opening}} of the new routes, the Tramway for the first time {{suffered}} serious competition. Although further from Brill than the Tramway's station, the GWR's station provided a fast and direct route to the GWR's London terminus at Paddington. The Great Central Railway's station at Wotton, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>Great</b> Western and Great Central Joint Railway station at Akeman Street, provided fast and direct routes to both Paddington and to the Great Central's new London terminus at Marylebone, without the need to change trains at Quainton Road. In addition, following the end of the First World War motorised road transport grew rapidly, drawing passenger and goods traffic away from the railways. The Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company repeatedly tried to persuade the Metropolitan Railway to buy the line outright, but the MR declined. In July 1923 the O tried to sell the line to the GWR and to the Electric and Railway Finance Corporation, but was rebuffed by both.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} recent stock markets’ interrelationships in Greater China (China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan). The main {{goal is to}} use more {{detailed}} and new daily stock market data from 2005 / 7 to 2010 / 5 to offer valuable and complementary insights on financial integration among these economies. From the empirical analysis, we found that China’s stock market has {{a positive impact on}} <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>Greater</b> China economies, but the reverse is not true. In addition, Hong Kong’s stock market also has a significantly positive impact on Taiwan, but not on China, and the impact of Hong Kong on Taiwan is larger than that of China on Taiwan. This result is consistent with the previous empirical findings that the segmented and integrated China stock market is mixed, and this result implies that the China stock market is still “partially integrated” with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>Greater</b> China stock markets after the 2008 global financial crisis...|$|R
5|$|For {{operations}} in the Mediterranean during the 5th century, fleets {{appear to have been}} assembled on an ad hoc basis and then disbanded. The first permanent Byzantine fleet {{can be traced to the}} early 6th century and the revolt of Vitalian in 513–515, when Anastasius I created a fleet to counter the rebels' own. This fleet was retained, and under Justinian I and his successors it was developed into a professional and well-maintained force. Because of the absence of any naval threat, however, the navy of the late 6th century was relatively small, with several small flotillas in the Danube and two main fleets maintained at Ravenna and Constantinople. Additional flotillas must have been stationed at <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>great</b> maritime and commercial centres of the Empire: at Alexandria, providing the escort to the annual grain fleet to Constantinople, and at Carthage, controlling the western Mediterranean. Justinian also stationed troops and ships at the more remote outposts of the Empire, at Septem (Ceuta), Cherson in the Crimea, and Aelana (Eilat) in the Gulf of Aqaba. The long-established naval tradition and infrastructure of those areas made the maintenance of the fleet easier, and, in the event of a naval expedition, a large fleet could be quickly and inexpensively assembled by impressing the numerous merchant vessels.|$|E
5|$|This {{situation}} was {{transformed by the}} founding of St John's College, St Andrews in 1418. Henry Wardlaw, bishop of St. Andrews, petitioned the anti-Pope Benedict XIII during the later stages of the Great Western Schism, when Scotland {{was one of his}} few remaining supporters. Wardlaw argued that Scottish scholars in other universities were being persecuted for their loyalty to the anti-Pope. St Salvator's College was added to St. Andrews in 1450. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>great</b> bishoprics followed, with the University of Glasgow being founded in 1451 and the King's College, Aberdeen in 1495. Both were also papal foundations, by Nicholas V and Alexander VI respectively. St Leonard's College was added at St. Andrews in 1511. St. Andrews was deliberately modelled on Paris, and although Glasgow adopted the statues of the University of Bologna, there, like Aberdeen, there was an increasing Parisian influence, partly because all its early regents had been educated in Paris. Initially, these institutions were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who began to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative posts in government and law. They provided only basic degrees. Those wanting to study for the more advanced degrees that were common amongst European scholars still needed to go to universities in other countries. As a result, Scottish scholars continued to visit the Continent and returned to English universities after they reopened to Scots in the late fifteenth century.|$|E
