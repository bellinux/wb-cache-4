5|$|After all, {{young people}} are always searching for the beauty in love. They want their love <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>beautiful.</b> If they give in to weakness, {{following}} the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a 'scandal in the contemporary world' (and these are, unfortunately, widely diffused models), {{in the depths of}} their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure love. This is as true of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God can give them this love. As a result, they are willing to follow Christ, without caring about the sacrifices this may entail.|$|E

25|$|Childbirth in Ghana {{is often}} seen as a joyous {{occasion}} in Ghanaian society, as children represent wealth, status, and the continuation of a lineage. Pregnant women are often given special privileges and are considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>beautiful,</b> fragile, and vulnerable to evil spirits. Therefore, women may seek guidance from a religious or spiritual diviner to protect their fetus or to increase their chances of conceiving.

25|$|Foot binding was a {{practice}} fashionable in Ming and Qing dynasty China. Young girls' feet, usually at age six but often earlier, were wrapped in tight bandages {{so they could}} not grow normally, would break and become deformed as they reached adulthood. The feet would remain small and dysfunctional, prone to infection, paralysis, and muscular atrophy. While such feet were considered by some <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>beautiful,</b> others considered the practice to be archaic and barbaric. In concert with community leaders, the Colonial Government launched an anti-foot binding campaign in 1901. The practice was formally banned in 1915, with violators subject to heavy punishment. Foot binding in Taiwan died out quickly afterwards.|$|E

25|$|The China Poblana was a {{real person}} who lived during the colonial period. Her real name was Mirra. She was an Indian who was brought over from Manila in the 1620s on the Manila Galleon as a child {{to work as a}} slave for the viceroy Marques de Gélves. She was soon sold to ship captain Miguel de Sosa who lived in Puebla. According to legend, Mirra was {{originally}} a princess in her home country but her family was displaced by the Portuguese and she was kidnapped by pirates who sold her. Mirra was considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>beautiful</b> and exotic. She had been converted to the Catholic faith. Later in her life, she began to have visions of the child Jesus and angels. Her fame grew and she was eventually considered to be something of a prophet. When she died in 1688, people began to venerate her as a saint and many women copied her Asian/Mexican inspired dress.|$|E

500|$|Moffat {{wanted the}} Silurians to be {{redesigned}} and without their former third eye, as Davros {{also had a}} third eye and he wanted the Silurians to be [...] "completely different". They were {{intended to be a}} different branch of the same species, and so the original Silurians still existed. Chibnall wrote for the redesigned Silurians <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>beautiful</b> and it was intended for the redesign to capture the actors' features and allow them to give stronger performances and differentiate themselves. Chibnall believed that it complemented the theme in the two-parter about how the humans and Silurians were alike and different. Due to the expensive prosthetics needed, extra Silurians wore face masks which prevented the need for every actor portraying a Silurian to receive the facial prosthetics. Chibnall also incorporated a poisonous tongue into the new branch of Silurians.|$|E

500|$|Another {{factor in}} the {{original}} development of set pieces was the design of vast and seamless environments. They were meant to enable scenarios such as the player character being shot at from a great distance, or a battle which would change scenes between the outside and inside of a building. This corroborated Nomura's intended action-oriented system with more intuitive game controls. He instructed his team to study third-person shooters for reference, [...] "not in simplistic terms, like controls or mechanics, but {{in the way they}} create tension and mood and incorporate the action within that". This carried over into XV, with the stated aim being to distance the game structurally from XIII and its sequels, which featured divided zones rather than a large seamless world. The original inspiration behind this approach was the world design of , with later inspirations being modern Western triple-A open world titles. The environments are divided into three different segments, with separate teams working on each: the world map, locations in the game world, and dungeons. The dungeons were designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>beautiful,</b> frightening, and memorable. Specific pieces of concept art were created to represent different regions and aesthetic concepts: a single building design was used to capture the essence of Altissia's Venice-inspired atmosphere, while older car designs when compared to the party's vehicle Regalia reflected the lack of human advancement outside Lucis.|$|E
500|$|Ged, who in {{the story}} goes by his common name of Sparrowhawk, only enters the novel midway through {{when he comes to}} the tombs to steal the ring of Erreth-Akbe. Where he was an {{adolescent}} in A Wizard of Earthsea, he is depicted as a mature individual in the second Earthsea volume, one who gradually transforms Tenar's view of the world. In The Tombs of Atuan he plays the role of the wise helper to the protagonist, a type of companionship common to Le Guin's novels. After Tenar chooses to talk to him rather than have him killed, he tells her about the rest of Earthsea that she is ignorant of, and so helps her see a path out of her difficulties that she could not. The scars that Ged bears from his encounter with the shadow in A Wizard of Earthsea make Tenar realize that he has confronted death in a way that she has never done. Literature scholar Elizabeth Cummins argues that while Ged does not actually save Tenar, he [...] "functions as the midwife in her rebirth". Ged is the figure of the [...] "other" [...] in this novel; in contrast to the other inhabitants of the Tombs, he is male, dark-skinned, and a wizard. Ged's difference in the story is symbolized by light on many occasions, such as when his staff allows Tenar to see the undertomb for the first time: she is shocked then to find it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>beautiful,</b> rather than just dark. Ged is responsible for giving Tenar a wider perspective and showing her a more compassionate and joyful world than her previous experience allowed her to imagine.|$|E
500|$|Anne exerted a {{powerful}} charm {{on those who}} met her, though opinions differed on her attractiveness. The Venetian diarist Marino Sanuto, who saw Anne when Henry VIII met Francis I at Calais in October 1532, described her as [...] "not one of the handsomest women in the world; she is of middling stature, swarthy complexion, long neck, wide mouth, bosom not much raised... eyes, which are black and beautiful". Simon Grynée wrote to Martin Bucer in September 1531 that Anne was [...] "young, good-looking, of a rather dark complexion". Lancelot de Carle called her [...] "beautiful with an elegant figure", and a Venetian in Paris in 1528 also reported that she was said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>beautiful.</b> The most influential description of Anne, but also the least reliable, was written by the Catholic propagandist and polemicist Nicholas Sanders in 1586, half a century after Anne's death: [...] "Anne Boleyn was rather tall of stature, with black hair, and an oval face of a sallow complexion, as if troubled with jaundice. It is {{said she had a}} projecting tooth under the upper lip, and on her right hand six fingers. There was a large wen under her chin, and therefore to hide its ugliness she wore a high dress covering her throat... She was handsome to look at, with a pretty mouth". Sanders held Anne responsible for Henry VIII's rejection of the Catholic Church, and writing fifty years after her death, was keen to demonise her. Sanders's description contributed to what biographer Eric Ives calls the [...] "monster legend" [...] of Anne Boleyn. Though his details were fictitious, they have formed the basis for references to Anne's appearance even in some modern textbooks.|$|E

500|$|Like many of Keats's odes, [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] {{discusses}} art and art's audience. He {{relied on}} depictions of natural music in earlier poems, and {{works such as}} [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] appeal to auditory sensations while ignoring the visual. Keats reverses this when describing an urn within [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] to focus on representational art. He previously used {{the image of an}} urn in [...] "Ode on Indolence", depicting one with three figures representing Love, Ambition and Poesy. Of these three, Love and Poesy are integrated into [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] with an emphasis on how the urn, as a human artistic construct, is capable of relating to the idea of [...] "Truth". The images of the urn described within the poem are intended as obvious depictions of common activities: an attempt at courtship, the making of music, and a religious rite. The figures are supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>beautiful,</b> and the urn itself is supposed to be realistic. Although the poem does not include the subjective involvement of the narrator, the description of the urn within the poem implies a human observer that draws out these images. The narrator interacts with the urn {{in a manner similar to}} how a critic would respond to the poem, which creates ambiguity in the poem's final lines: [...] "'Beauty is truth, truth beauty,' – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know." [...] The lack of a definite voice of the urn causes the reader to question who is really speaking these words, to whom they are speaking, and what is meant by the words, which encourages the reader to interact with the poem in an interrogative manner like the narrator.|$|E
500|$|Mic {{organized}} {{a list of}} [...] "5 Reasons Claire Huxatable (sic) is the Ultimate Feminist Mom", and The Huffington Post crowned The Cosby Show [...] "One of the Most Feminist Shows of All Time" [...] due to individual contributions from both Clair and Cliff.

CNN ranked the rant their seventh favorite The Cosby Show moment. Slates Jason Bailey hailed the scene as [...] "Rashad’s finest moment on the show." [...] The rant has proven so popular that it continues to be frequently quoted and referenced on the Internet and social media. Pastes Shannon M. Houston believes that [...] "If you’re a woman, and you work, and you identify as a feminist, there’s a 90 percent chance you or someone you know has posted that clip". Additionally, Houston believes that the scene remains so popular because the discussion about women in the workplace has hardly changed since the episode first aired 30 years ago. According to Nico Lang of The Daily Dot, Clair taught an entire generation [...] "what a strong, successful woman looked like". Former United States First Lady Michelle Obama has constantly been compared to Clair, by which Obama admitted she is flattered because she considers the character to be an [...] "American icon". Patrice Evans of Jezebel wrote that although [...] "Michelle Obama might be taking the baton as the quintessential symbol of the professional black woman/doting mother ... she'll still need Barack to win a second term before she can approach the status of Clair Huxtable." [...] However, Rashad herself has discredited the Clair-Obama comparisons. LGBT rights activist Janet Mock cites Clair as one of her biggest influences: [...] "I wanted to be her; I wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>beautiful,</b> be successful, and maybe have a great family and a brownstone in Brooklyn." ...|$|E
