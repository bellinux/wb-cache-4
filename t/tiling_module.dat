40|$|Released on 2017 - 4 - 12 Xiaoyan Qian What's new: Taglist {{can take}} both csv file (recommended) and MATLAB function. Bar plot "read count" showing reads sorted based on frequency, but all {{expected}} reads have higher ranking than unexpected reads. Barcode list file, intensity reading file (from Cellprofiler) and tile position file (from <b>Tiling</b> <b>module</b> of Sequencing_v 3) for SlideA {{data are provided}} as examples. What's changed: Output file "gene_n_count" has the same gene order as in the input taglist. Bar plot "gene count" has all genes in the UItable sorted alphabetically. Output file "details" always includes parent cell, min_anchor, min_quality and min_align. Generally improved performance. What's removed: Automatic saving of all variables in the workspace. Analysis before threshold module, and all related scripts and functions...|$|E
40|$|The digital graphic systems {{development}} is evident during the alternative generation process, {{especially when the}} component objects are linked to a geometric base by modulation. In this sense, the tiling modular characteristics are used as geometric support which modulation or internal divisions contain material forms (objects in 3 D) immaterial forms (spaces in 3 D). That {{is to say that}} each <b>tiling</b> <b>module</b> can be projected or not in 3 D. The way to do this consists of applying it not only as two-dimensional support but also as operational structure by means of operations of pure translation, in 3 D. It is applied to architectural themes which systemic parts or components sectors admit repetitions of units (dwelling buildings, schools, offices, hotels, etc.) in plan floor levels and in elevation as well. When programmatic and morphological requirements are solved groups are organized conforming systems in two or three dimensions. In the alternative generation stage it is tried to avoid conditioning and restrictions developing a ludic process of "piling up tiles" simple concepts stimulating creativity for the production of innovating architectonic forms. Creative ideas can arise from the game playing with 3 D forms. This paper attempts to show a manner to generate unusual architectural forms that, otherwise, within a traditional design process might not be found. Some architectural examples developed with this ludic procedure are presented...|$|E

An area of 300 mm] 300 mm {{will be covered}} by <b>tiling</b> many <b>modules.</b> A module will comprise a 64] 448 array of 150 lm] 150 lm silicon pixels covering an area of 9. 6 nm] 67. 2 mm. This will be #ip chip bonded to 7 ALADIN readout chips, that each contain a 64] 64 array of 144 mm] 150 lm pixels. Each readout pixel comprises a pre-ampli"er, shaper, discriminator, 15 -bit counter and 5 -bit register that enables threshold adjust, pixel masking and calibrate control. Each pixel is designed to operate at & 1 MHz providing a count rate capability of & 109 cm~ 2 s~ 1. The system will operate in the energy range from 4 to 25 keV and at a frame rate of up to 1 kHz. The current status of the project is reported, along with the detector guard structure chosen to minimise the dead region around the active volume of the silicon detectors...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in both clone fingerprinting and draft sequencing technology {{have made it}} increasingly common for species to have a bacterial artificial clone (BAC) fingerprint map, BAC end sequences (BESs) and draft genomic sequence. The FPC (fingerprinted contigs) software package contains three modules that maximize {{the value of these}} resources. The BSS (blast some sequence) module provides a way to easily view the results of aligning draft sequence to the BESs, and integrates the results with the following two modules. The MTP (minimal <b>tiling</b> path) <b>module</b> uses sequence and fingerprints to determine a minimal tiling path of clones. The DSI (draft sequence integration) module aligns draft sequences to FPC contigs, displays them alongside the contigs and identifies potential discrepancies; the alignment can be based on either individual BES alignments to the draft, or on the locations of BESs that have been assembled into the draft. FPC also supports highthroughput fingerprint map generation as its time-intensive functions have been parallelized for Unix-based desktops or servers with multiple CPUs. Simulation results are provided for the MTP, DSI and parallelization. These features are in the FPC V 9. 3 software package, which is freely available...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT : BACKGROUND : Studies on {{the human}} myometrium have {{reported}} on different microarrays containing different sets of genes or ESTs. However each study profiled {{only a small number}} of patients due to various constraints. More profiling information would be an addition to our knowledge base of parturition. METHODS : We compiled from five human studies, transcriptional differences between the non pregnant myometrium (NP), preterm myometrium (PTNIL), term myometrium not in labor (TNIL) and term myometrium in labor (<b>TIL).</b> Software <b>modules</b> developed by the Draghici's group at Wayne State University (Detroit, MI, USA) were used to propose a hierarchical list of several KEGG pathways most likely adjusted to changes observed in microarray experiments. RESULTS : The differential expression of 118 genes could be dispatched in 14 main KEGG pathways that were the most representative of the changes seen in NP and PTNIL, versus TNIL or TIL. Despite the potential of multiple pitfalls inherent to the use of the microarray technology, gene module analysis of the myometrial transcriptome reveals the activation of precise signaling pathways, some of which may have been under evaluated. CONCLUSION : The remodelling and maturation processes that the uterus undergoes in pregnancy appear clearly as phenomena which last during the full course of gestation. It is attested by the nature of the main signaling pathways represented, in the comparison of the PTNIL versus TNIL uterus. Comparatively, the onset of labor is a phenomenon which remains less well characterized by these methods of analysis, possibly because it is a phenomenon occurring in too short a window to have been grasped by the studies carried out up to now...|$|R
40|$|The Medipix 3 {{photon-counting}} detector chip has {{a number}} of novel features that are attractive for synchrotron experiments, such as a high frame rate with zero dead time and high spatial resolution. DESY are developing a large-area Medipix 3 -based detector array (LAMBDA). A single LAMBDA module consists of 2 by 6 Medipix 3 chips on a ceramic carrier board, bonded to either a single large silicon sensor or two smaller high-Z sensors. The readout system fits behind the carrier board to allow <b>module</b> <b>tiling,</b> and uses a large on-board RAM and multiple 10 Gigabit Ethernet links to permit high-speed readout. Currently, the first large silicon modules have been constructed and read out at low speed, and the firmware for highspeed readout is being developed. In addition to these silicon sensors, we are developing a germanium hybrid pixel detector in collaboration with Canberra for higher-energy beamlines. Canberra have produced a set of 256 -by- 256 -pixel planar germanium sensors wit h 55 Âµm pitch, and these are currently being bonded to Medipix 3 readout chips by Fraunhofer IZM (Berlin) ...|$|R
