50|$|In Northern Ireland, the Scout {{pioneered the}} use of the Heli-Tele aerial {{surveillance}} system, having a gyro-stabilised Marconi unit shoe-horned into the rear cabin. The Heli-Tele unit weighed some 700 lb, although later developments reduced this significantly. The aircraft was also used for mounting Eagle patrols. In this role, the rear cabin doors and seats were removed and four troops sat in the rear cabin with their feet resting on the skids. Operating with two aircraft in unison, this allowed an eight-man patrol to be quickly inserted into an area and mount snap Vehicle Check Points (VCPs) if necessary. Up until 1973, the standard tail rotor colour scheme for the Scout was bands of red and white. On 14 September 1973, a soldier died during training at Gosford Castle, Armagh, after coming into contact with the tail rotor blades whilst the aircraft was on the ground. Following this accident, the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> colour scheme was changed to the distinctive black and white bands.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} {{of a helicopter}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> with the tip vortex system from the main rotor is {{a significant source of}} noise and, in some flight states, can produce marked reductions in control effectiveness. This paper describes a series of wind-tunnel tests to simulate <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> vortex interaction with a view to providing data for the development and validation of numerical simulations of the phenomenon. In the experiments, which were carried out in the Argyll wind-tunnel of Glasgow University, a single-bladed rotor located in the tunnelâ€™s contraction was used to generate the tip vortex which travelled downstream into the working section where it interacted with a model tail rotor. The tail rotor was instrumented with miniature pressure transducers that measured the aerodynamic response during the interaction. The results suggest that the rotor blade vortex interaction is similar in form to that measured at much higher spatial resolution on a fixed, non-rotating blade...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} {{that lead to}} the production of noise by <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> across a broad range of flight conditions and helicopter configurations remains an active area of research. Furthermore, designers require numerical models that are able to efficiently and accurately predict the acoustic signature of the heli-copter. Predictions made using the Vorticity Transport Model in conjunction with a linear acoustics code, in which the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equation is solved for the sound pressure level on a horizontal observer plane beneath a scaled model of the Bo- 105 helicopter, have been shown to compare well with measurements made during the HeliNOVI experiments. As the vertical distance between the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and the main rotor is reduced, the acoustic signature of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> changes considerably. Both the blade-vortex interactions that oc-cur between the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> and their tip vortices, and the interactions between the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> and the tip vortices trailed behind the main <b>rotor</b> <b>blades,</b> act as major sources of loading noise.

40|$|Abstract. Aircraft {{engineers}} {{in the design}} phase often use practical solutions and results of the elementary theory of structures under the classical hypotheses assumed for shear, torsion and bending behaviour of structural elements that can be studied as "beams". This assumption, very powerful in general, under particular situations (for example: the modification of loading conditions {{in the development of}} new aircraft versions) can be inadequate to represent real distributions of stress and strain. This is particularly true when local behaviour of structures depends on secondary phenomena such as warping produced by non-uniform bending and torsion acting on structural elements with variable stiffness along their flexural axis. In this paper the results of analytical and experimental studies carried out for a metallic <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> of a helicopter are summarised; this research activity was born during a collaboration between the Department of Aerospace Engineering of Pisa and an aeronautical industry. Local strain distributions under real loading conditions have been obtained by means of finite element analyses and by means of strain gauge measurements. To describe warping mechanisms accurately, also caused by the presence of a reinforcing plate of the blade structure, sub-modelling technique has been used and during a fatigue test, the blade was instrumented with an appropriate number of rosettes. Numerical and experimental results show, with a good agreement, that local geometry of the blade and the severe loading condition produce a considerable increase of strains that elementary theory can not predict; moreover, numerical results and above all strain measurements have proved that local yielding of the material can occur during the service life with detrimental effects on the fatigue endurance of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blade...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} restrictions {{placed on}} helicopter noise levels over recent decades have encouraged manufacturers {{to better understand}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> noise and its aerodynamic sources. A generic single main <b>rotor</b> and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> helicopter has been simulated in high speed forward, and quartering, flight using the Vorticity Transport Model. The unsteady loads developed on the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> and the resulting acoustic noise propagation have been computed. The sound propagation from isolated <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> with top-aft and top-forward senses of rotation in high speed forward flight results in impulsive sound being directed downward from the former and upward from the latter. The principal source of <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> noise in high speed forward flight is a periodic blade-vortex interaction between the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blades.</b> The effect of aerodynamic interaction on <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> noise is highly dependent on the flight speed and trajectory, such that the noise produced {{as a result of}} interaction is, for the particular helicopter geometry simulated here, greater in quartering flight than in high speed forward flight. The sound pressure produced by periodic impulsive loads in high speed forward flight and the high frequency sound generated in quartering flight is sensitive to the scales to which the vortical features within the wake, and the radial and azimuthal distributions of blade loading, are resolved...|$|R
