5|$|In April 1956, Marshall led a {{delegation}} to London to negotiate for complete self-rule in the Merdeka Talks, but the talks failed when <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>were</b> {{reluctant to give}} up control over Singapore's internal security. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> <b>were</b> concerned about communist influence and labour strikes which were undermining Singapore's economic stability, and felt that the local government was ineffective in handling earlier riots. Marshall resigned following {{the failure of the}} talk.|$|E
5|$|The OKL {{believed}} that <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>were</b> {{down to their}} last 300 fighters, with only 250 being produced. To stop fighter production, factories in Bristol were to be attacked. London was also {{to be subjected to}} round the clock bombing.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>were</b> defeated, more French Creole {{families}} evaded Anglo-American rule {{by moving}} to the Spanish-controlled land on the west bank, including wealthy merchants Charles Gratiot, Sr. and Gabriel Cerre. Both the Gratiot and Cerre families intermarried with the Chouteau family to create a Creole-dominated society in the 1780s and 1790s. The families also had marital ties to Spanish government officials, including the lieutenant governors Piernas and Cruzat.|$|E

50|$|By 12:40 {{the battle}} was over. Six Americans were dead and 35 <b>were</b> wounded. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> {{suffered}} 17 dead and 77 wounded.The greater significance of this battle and the greater loss to <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> passage of time allowing General Andrew Jackson to gather more troops and to complete fortifications for the defense at Chalmette where victory over <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>was</b> achieved on January 7.|$|R
50|$|In India, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> Imperial army <b>is</b> {{fighting}} the natives {{and a group}} of Robin Hood-like bandits called the Dakaits. Allied to <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Zamindars, landowners that find it in their interest to have <b>the</b> <b>British</b> ruling over India. A sadhu by the name of Dada Thakur is directing the efforts of the Dakaits against <b>the</b> <b>British</b> and <b>is</b> told by a goddess that {{help is on the way}} for the Dakaits.|$|R
5|$|At the bridge, Frost's forces {{continued}} to hold but without supply or reinforcement their position was becoming weaker. The Germans—realising that infantry attacks were unlikely to remove the stubborn defenders—began to systematically destroy the houses <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>were</b> in using tanks, artillery and mortars. In {{the absence of any}} Allied air cover, the Luftwaffe were able to make strafing runs on the British occupied houses as well.|$|E
5|$|Eyre and {{the crew}} were landed and marched to Antibes, where they were imprisoned with the crew of a Sardinian frigate that had been {{captured}} the day before Speedy. The crew had been imprisoned on Martin's flagship Sans Culotte and had been severely treated, with their captain, Ross, not being allowed to wash or shave. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> <b>were</b> placed in a dungeon at Antibes, with only straw to lie on, awaiting {{the decision of the}} authorities. After three weeks in this state, they were marched to Aix-en-Provence and were confined in the prison there. After a month imprisoned in Aix, Maximilien Robespierre fell and the Reign of Terror came to an end. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> <b>were</b> paroled. Eyre and the officers were taken to Romans, in Dauphiné where Eyre remained until May 1795 when he was released in exchange for a French officer. He faced a court-martial for the loss of Speedy, but was honourably acquitted.|$|E
5|$|In 1806, a British {{expeditionary force}} invaded Buenos Aires.

Rosas was then assigned to the Caballería de los Migueletes (a militia cavalry), although he was probably barred from active duty during this time due to illness.|$|E

5|$|In July 1952, Kesselring was {{diagnosed}} with a cancerous growth in the throat. During World War I, he had frequently smoked up to twenty cigars per day but he quit smoking in 1925. Although <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>were</b> suspicious of the diagnosis, they were concerned that he might die in prison like Mälzer, which would be a public relations disaster. Kesselring was transferred to a hospital, under guard. In October 1952, Kesselring was released from his prison sentence on the grounds of ill-health.|$|E
5|$|Iraqi–British {{relations}} {{entered a}} short cooling-down period {{during and after}} the crisis. The Iraqis were previously encouraged by the British to detain Patriarch Shimun in order to defuse tensions. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> <b>were</b> also wary of Iraqi military leaders and recommended Sidqi, a senior ethnic Kurdish general who was stationed in Mosul, be transferred to another region due to his open animosity towards the Assyrians. Later, they had to intervene to dissuade Faysal from personally leading a tribal force to punish the Assyrians.|$|E

5|$|The column {{had yet to}} {{run into}} any American troops when they reached Howard's Tavern (also known as Howard's Half-Way House), {{just a few hundred}} yards from the Jamaica Pass. Tavern keeper William Howard and his son William Jr. were forced to act as guides to show the British the way to the Rockaway Foot Path, an old Indian trail that skirted the Jamaica Pass to the west (located today in the Cemetery of the Evergreens). Five minutes after leaving the tavern, the five American militia {{officers}} stationed at the pass were captured without a shot fired, as they thought that <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>were</b> Americans. Clinton interrogated the men and they informed him that they were the only troops guarding the pass. By dawn, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>were</b> through the pass and stopped so that the troops could rest. At 09:00, they fired two heavy cannons to signal the Hessian troops below Battle Pass to begin their frontal assault against Sullivan's men deployed on the two hills flanking the pass, while Clinton's troops simultaneously flanked the American positions from the east.|$|E
