40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concentrated}} on <b>cultural</b> <b>centres</b> built between years 1960 and 1990 {{in the former}} socialist Czechoslovakia. Six <b>cultural</b> <b>centres</b> have been chosen and analyzed to conclude the purposes they serve {{as well as the}} programs they offer. These chosen <b>cultural</b> <b>centres</b> are run as municipal organisations financed from the town budgets. The six towns where they are located are similar to each other in terms of their history, size and the time when <b>their</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>centres</b> were built. All of these centres share difficulties with the lack of cultural interest of local citizens, bad technical shape of the buildings in question and low budget. The aim of this thesis is to compare the functioning of these six <b>cultural</b> <b>centres</b> and conclude whether being directly funded and influenced by the municipal councils has a positive impact and should {{serve as a model for}} <b>cultural</b> <b>centres</b> or should be replaced by a different one. It also focuses on cooperation between the management of <b>cultural</b> <b>centres</b> and municipal officials, cooperation with other local cultural institutions and <b>cultural</b> <b>centres</b> from different towns...|$|R

The three villages {{together}} are called Upper Őrség (Hun: Felső-Őrség, German: Wart), and they have formed a language island since the 11th century. The other old Hungarian language island in Oberpullendorf/Felsőpulya has almost disappeared today. The Hungarians of Burgenland were [...] "őrök", i.e. guards of the western frontier, and their special dialect {{is similar to the}} Székelys in Transylvania. <b>Their</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>centre</b> is Oberwart/Felsőőr. Another distinct Hungarian group were the indentured agricultural workers living on the huge estates north of Neusiedler See. They arrived mainly from the Rábaköz region.

With expansion of trade with the French and later the British, fostered by availability of European small arms, members of the Council of Three Fires expanded southward to the Ohio River, southwestward along the Illinois River, and westward along Lake Superior, Lake of the Woods and the northern Great Plains. In their western expansion, the Ojibwa again divided, forming the Saulteaux, the seventh major branch of the Anishinaabeg.|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{selected}} texts and authors {{associated with the}} <b>cultural</b> <b>centre</b> exil in <b>Vienna</b> which promotes the culture of migrants and minorities, mainly Roma and Sinti, in Austria. Since 1997 exil has awarded the annual prize writing between cultures. The literary prize addresses authors with a migrant background’ whose mother tongue is not German but who write in German. Texts entered for this prize should cover (in the broadest sense) {{one of the following}} topics: being foreign, being different, identity, flight, expulsion, arriving, integration or living between cultures. Attached to the centre is the publishing house edition exil. The thesis investigates the negotiation of cultural identities of migrants at the intersection of the <b>cultural</b> <b>centre</b> exil individual life histories and literary creations. Tensions and contradictions between institutional and individual discourses are identified and are related to the literary works of the authors Seher Çakr, Dimitré Dinev, Anna Kim, Grace M. Latigo, Julya Rabinowich, Simone Schönett and Sina Tahayori. My analysis is informed by a theoretical framework which incorporates concepts of cultural identity, canonisation and the construction of community, and combines a cultural sociological approach with a textual one: the analysis focuses on qualitative interviews with selected authors as well as literary texts. I hope to demonstrate the tensions between cultural integration and exclusion and to investigate the place authors around exil negotiate for themselves. The aim of the project is to highlight exil’s as well as the authors’ contribution to the Austrian literary field and to provide a better understanding of their early literary works and their self-conception as writers...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{establish}} the link between tourists’ perceptions on <b>cultural</b> offers and <b>their</b> overall satisfaction, and explore the implication of this link for sustainable tourist destination management. Assessing online customers’ reviews, this study identifies {{a positive correlation between}} visitors’ perspectives and experiences at the on-site <b>cultural</b> <b>centre</b> and visitors’ destination satisfaction. It suggests that the on-site <b>cultural</b> <b>centre</b> plays a critical role in building up visitors’ perception on cultural attributes of the destination, and its impact on visitor satisfaction is a double-edged sword. Visitors’ positive perspectives on the <b>cultural</b> <b>centre</b> enhance visitors’ experiences and contribute to their destination satisfaction; however, not only does a negative perspective on <b>their</b> <b>cultural</b> and spiritual experience compromise visitors’ satisfaction, but also subsequent negative online reviews damage the destination image and discourage visitor return/visit. The findings help destination management organisations to better understand visitors’ preference for <b>cultural</b> <b>centres</b> and therefore to improve visitors’ cultural experience. This paper appeals for further study of on-site cultural centres’ role in forming destination cultural attributes, and of social media’s potential in enriching cultural experience...|$|R

50|$|Richmond {{was one of}} the {{original}} Macedonian Settlements in Australia. The first Macedonian to come to Richmond was Steve Pandu, from the village Kotori in Lerin, Macedonia (Florina, Greece) in 1927. He was joined by many other Macedonians and by 1938 they had established many farms and market-gardens. Soon more Macedonians came to establish orchard's in the Agnes Banks area. Many family members were brought out from Yugoslavia and Greece. in 1946 a chapter of the Macedonian-Australian People's League opened in Richmond. The Macedonians in Richmond were an integral part in Macedonian-Australian society. By 1950 a large concentration of Aegean Macedonians from the village Kotori was present. After the Macedonian-Australian People's League decentralized the Richmond Macedonian Association was founded in 1961. Later still in 1980, this organisation split half, forming the Aegean Macedonian Social and Cultural Society and the Macedonian Cultural and Art Society, Pelister. The Aegean Macedonian Social and Cultural Society went on to raise over $100,000 to build <b>their</b> own <b>cultural</b> <b>centre</b> which was opened on 26 December 1983, the Macedonian Hall, Kotori. Today both groups still operate independently although talks of re-unification have been fruitless. In Richmond two KUDs were set up, KUD Pelister and KUD Kotori. Community spokespersons claim that there are over 700 Macedonians in the Richmond Area.|$|R
2500|$|The Germanic {{language}} which diutisc {{most likely}} comes from is West Frankish, a language which died {{out a long}} time ago and which there is hardly any written evidence for today. This was the Germanic dialect used in the early Middle Ages, spoken by the Franks in Western Francia, i.e. in the region which is now northern France. The word is only known from the Latin form theodiscus. Until the 8th century the Franks called their language frengisk; however, when the Franks moved <b>their</b> political and <b>cultural</b> <b>centre</b> to the area where France now is, the term frengisk became ambiguous, as in the West Francian territory some Franks spoke Latin, some vulgar Latin and some theodisc. For this reason a new word was needed to help differentiate between them. Thus the word theodisc evolved from the Germanic word theoda (the people) with the Latin suffix -iscus, to mean [...] "belonging to the people", i.e. the people's language.|$|R
