2500|$|The first French {{synchronizer}} {{was developed}} by Sergeant-Mecanicien Robert Alkan and l'Ingenieur du Maritime Hamy. It was based closely on the definitive Fokker Stangensteuerung gear: the main difference being that the push rod was installed within the Vickers gun, using a redundant steam tube in <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket.</b> This mitigated a major drawback of other push rod gears in that the rod, being supported for its whole length, was much less liable to distortion or breakage. Vickers guns modified to take this gear can be distinguished by the housing for the push rod's spring, projecting {{from the front of}} the gun like a second barrel. This gear was first installed and air-tested in a Nieuport 12, on 2 May 1916, and other pre-production gears were fitted to contemporary Morane-Saulnier and Nieuport fighters. The Alkan-Hamy gear was standardised as the Systeme de Synchronisation pour Vickers Type I (moteurs rotatifs), becoming available in numbers in time for the arrival of the Nieuport 17 at the front in mid 1916, and synchronizing the forward-firing guns of all rotary-engined French aircraft. The exception was the Nieuport 28, which used a different gear – now known only through American documentation, where it is described as the [...] "Nieuport Synchronizing gear" [...] or the [...] "Gnome gear". A spinning drive shaft, driven by the rotating crankcase of the Nieuport's 160 CV Gnome 9N Monosoupape rotary engine, drove two separately adjustible trigger motors – each imparting firing impulses to its gun by means of its own short rod.|$|E

5000|$|The weapon has two barrels and is {{chambered}} in the [...]303 British round. <b>The</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket</b> {{is similar}} to the Maxim gun but comes with a steam valve. The Caldwell is lighter and simpler than the Maxim and can be field stripped in under 1 minute without the use of tools. The rate of fire of the Caldwell is variable as the gun is fired with a hand crank with the rate of fire dependant of the operator.|$|E
5000|$|A {{lightened}} {{and thus}} more portable version — by [...] "stepping-down" [...] the upper rear and lower forward corners of the original MG 08's rectangular-outline receiver and breech assembly, and reducing <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket's</b> diameter to 92.5 millimeters — was tested as a prototype in 1915 {{by a team of}} weapon designers under the direction of an Oberst Friedrich von Merkatz—the MG 08/15.|$|R
50|$|The D.II {{was fairly}} quickly {{replaced}} by the D.III, and ended production around 1916. The D.III was essentially a scaled-up D.II, although it abandoned <b>the</b> paired <b>cooling</b> <b>jackets.</b>|$|R

To know the flow in <b>the</b> <b>jacket</b> <b>cooling</b> system for marine diesel engine 93 KW and the couple simulation between 1 D modeling and 3 D modeling, the methodology used. The analysis process was performed by using 3 diffrent softwares. The methodology to analysis fluid flow is CFD (computational fluid dynamic) with steps were problem identification, literature study, design <b>the</b> <b>jacket</b> <b>cooling</b> system based on the cummin diesel engine 93 KW, 1 D modeling of cooling system, 3 D modeling fluid flow in <b>jacket</b> <b>cooling</b> system, and conclusion. The input of 3 D <b>jacket</b> <b>cooling</b> simulation are mass flow, fluid temperature, wall temperature, and heat transfer.

50|$|Kulspruta m/14-29 was the Swedish {{designation}} for the licensed M1917A1, {{produced by}} Carl Gustafs Gevärsfaktori in Eskilstuna, for infantry support. The main differences {{was that it}} was chambered in the standard caliber 6.5×55mm, had spade-grips and used <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket</b> and tripod of the m/14 (Schwarzlose) tripod, the machine gun the Ksp m/14-29 replaced. Reason for replacement was simply manufacturing costs: 50 machine guns using the Browning mechanism could be made to the same cost as 30 Schwarzlose, which was discovered during the manufacture of Kulspruta m/22.|$|E
5000|$|These alternated between seven rows of nine [...] "oblong" [...] slots, {{alternating}} with seven more intervening rows of eight slots and twin round holes {{fore and aft}} of the slots apiece. Because of the important physical reinforcement provided by <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket</b> on the MG 08 series of guns, the excessive slotting of the initial model of the air-cooled lMG 08 — amounting to slightly over 50% of the total area of the cylindrical cooling jacket's original circumferential sheetmetal — rendered the gun as too fragile, {{to the point of}} making it impossible to fit the muzzle booster that the water-cooled infantry MG 08 guns could be fitted with.|$|E
50|$|The {{single jacket}} is {{probably}} the oldest design of external cooling jacket. Despite being a tried and tested solution, it has some limitations. On large vessels, it can take many minutes to adjust {{the temperature of the}} fluid in <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket.</b> This results in sluggish temperature control. The distribution of heat transfer fluid is also far from ideal and the heating or cooling tends to vary between the side walls and bottom dish. Another issue to consider is the inlet temperature of the heat transfer fluid which can oscillate (in response to the temperature control valve) over a wide temperature range to cause hot or cold spots at the jacket inlet points.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> engine <b>cooling</b> water <b>jacket</b> has a {{major impact}} on the {{efficiency}} of the engine. In this paper the flow in <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> water <b>jacket</b> of <b>the</b> six-cylinder four stroke water-cooled diesel engine was studied with the commercial software of STAR CCM+. Results of the simulation reveals that velocity has little effect on the flow field distribution. Dead zone in engine cylinder head appeared far away from the inlet of the flow. But it could be avoided or improved effectively by arranging the inlet and outlet at opposite side of <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> water <b>jacket.</b> Further study suggests that a good flow field distribution can be achieved near the entrance if one inlet was put at {{the same side of the}} outlet and the other the opposite side, while the wall was impacted fierce due to the strong turbulence and eddy existed. Finally some advices were given to solve the problem...|$|R
50|$|Some design {{details were}} carried over from a steam-powered {{prototype}} {{made by the}} Hildebrand brothers in 1889, including the water tank shaped to form the rear mudguard and the connecting rods of the engine driving the rear wheel directly. The water tank was repurposed to supply water to <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jackets</b> surrounding <b>the</b> cylinders. The steam-powered prototype had a double-acting cylinder, applying power to the piston in both directions. With no double action available in the petrol engine, and no flywheel effect apart from {{the movement of the}} rear wheel, the return impulse for the piston was provided by heavy rubber bands.|$|R
5000|$|Despite its undeniable effectiveness, the Beretta Model 38 {{proved too}} {{time-consuming}} and expensive to produce during wartime. Marengoni designed a simplified model made from sheet steel, in which <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket</b> and bayonet mount were eliminated, and the separate firing pin mechanism deleted {{in favor of}} a fixed firing pin machined {{on the face of the}} bolt. Barrel and wooden stock were also shortened to save weight and cost. This new model the Model 38/42 had a fluted barrel to aid cooling and save weight. It also had a slower rate of fire (550 rpm). The Model 38/43, was an intermediate production stage between the 42 and 44 patterns. [...] The 38/42 and 38/43 were adopted by the Wehrmacht as the Maschinenpistole 738(i) , abbreviated as MP.738.|$|E
50|$|The Parabellum MG14 was a 7.9 mm caliber World War I {{machine gun}} built by Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken. It was a {{redesign}} of the Maschinengewehr 08 machine gun (itself {{an adaptation of}} the Maxim gun) system intended for use on aircraft and zeppelins, that used a toggle action that broke upwards rather than downwards opposite the MG 08, making for a much more compact receiver. The fusee spring was dispensed with for an internal spring design, the breech block was completely different and the spent cartridges dropped out {{the bottom of the}} receiver rather than forward through a hole in receiver. There appears to be no action or receiver parts interchangeable with the MG 08. The MG08's belt-style ammunition feed was enclosed in a drum, the recoil casing was lightened and <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket</b> was modified for air- instead of water-cooling. The rate of fire was 700 rounds/minute. The belt was reduced to 30 mm in width.|$|E
50|$|A {{variation}} of the 'heat flow' technique is called 'power compensation' calorimetry. This method uses a cooling jacket operating at constant flow and temperature. The process temperature is regulated by adjusting {{the power of the}} electrical heater. When the experiment is started, the electrical heat and the cooling power (of <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket)</b> are in balance. As the process heat load changes, the electrical power is varied {{in order to maintain the}} desired process temperature. The heat liberated or absorbed by the process is determined from the difference between the initial electrical power and the demand for electrical power at the time of measurement. The power compensation method is easier to set up than heat flow calorimetry but it suffers from the similar limitations since any change in product composition, liquid level, process temperature, agitation rate or viscosity will upset the calibration. The presence of an electrical heating element is also undesirable for process operations. The method is further limited by the fact that the largest heat it can measure is equal to the initial electrical power applied to the heater.|$|E
50|$|Between 1959 and 1960 {{the engine}} was {{modified}} to improve reliability for manned flight. Thrust was also increased 2%, thanks to improved injection elements. It also introduced an innovation attributed to S.A. Kosbergs in its construction, {{that has been a}} staple of Soviet (and later Russian) engines. It used a corrugated metal construction for <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jackets,</b> with <b>the</b> lower section of the nozzle lacking an external liner, to save weight. This led to a 9.3% weight reduction even with the increased thrust. This new version was christened as the RD-0109 and entered service on the December 22, 1960, launch of a (Vostok) spacecraft aboard a Vostok-K 8K72K.|$|R
50|$|The RD-0110 uses fuel as coolant for <b>the</b> regen <b>cooling</b> system. As {{most other}} Soviet designs, {{it uses a}} {{corrugated}} metal construction for <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jackets.</b> <b>The</b> thrust chamber and upper nozzle sections has the corrugated metal sandwiched between an inner and outer metal layers. The lower section of the nozzle has no external lining, exposing the corrugated jacket to save weight. All this sections use steel for construction. Given the extreme temperatures at the throat section, this part is made of copper alloy with milled channels and an external lining. A separate film cooling system is implemented though a different manifold and is injected though a circular slot upstream of the throat.|$|R
5000|$|The later {{models of}} lMG 08 {{air-cooled}} machine gun variously [...] "tweaked" [...] {{the amount of}} slotting of the barrel by {{reducing the amount of}} sheet metal removed from it in minor ways through {{at least two or three}} trial formats, and eventually in the final versions produced, had the slotting omitted at the extreme ends of <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket's</b> cylindrical member, with a 13 cm wide area of solid sheet metal at the breech end, and a 5 cm wide solid area at the muzzle end, giving the resultant gun much more rigidity. The lMG 08 also retained unchanged the rectangular rear receiver and breech assembly of the water-cooled MG 08 infantry weapon.|$|R
5000|$|The submachine {{guns that}} Erma started {{to sell in}} 1932 under the names EMP (Erma Maschinenpistole) or MPE (Maschinenpistole Erma) was {{basically}} just the VMP1930 with <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket</b> restored. Although there were several variants with varying barrel lengths and sights made to customers' specifications, roughly three main variants were produced: one with a 30 cm barrel, tangent rear sight and bayonet lug was apparently sold to Bulgaria or Yugoslavia. The second model, sometimes called the MP34, or the [...] "standard model", had a 25 cm barrel and no provision for a bayonet; the rear sight on these varies—some had a tangent sight, others a simplified flip-up [...] "L" [...] sight. A third variant was basically similar in the metallic parts, but replaced the foregrip with a MP18-style stock with finger-grooves. Overall, at least 10,000 of these Vollmer-based designs were made by Erma. They were adopted by the SS in 1936, but also sold to South-American countries and to Spain, where it was subsequently manufactured locally under the designation M41/44.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, Vollmer started {{to develop his}} own sub-machineguns. His early models, named VPG, VPGa, VPF and VMP1925 were fairly similar to the MP18. The VMP1925 had a wooden {{handgrip}} and was fed by a small 25-round drum magazine, connected directly to the gun. The VMP1925 was secretly tested by the Reichswehr, along with competing designs from Schmeisser and Rheinmetall. (The Reichswehr was prohibited by the Versailles Treaty from having sub-machine guns in service, although the German police was allowed to carry a small number.) Secret funding was given to Vollmer to continue development, and this resulted in the VMP1926, which mostly differed from its predecessor by the removal of <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket.</b> A subsequent development was the VMP1928, which introduced a 32-round box magazine sticking from the left side. The final development of this series was the VMP1930. (It {{can also be seen}} at the WTS.) This model introduced a substantive innovation—a telescoping main spring assembly, which made the gun more reliable and easier to assemble and disassemble in the field. Vollemer applied for a patent for his innovation in 1930 and it was granted in 1933 as DRP# 580620. His company, Vollmer Werke, produced however only about 400 of these, and most were sold to Bulgaria. In late 1930, the Reichswehr stopped supporting Vollmer financially; consequently he sold the rights to all his designs to the company known as Erma Werke (which is an abbreviation for Erfurter Maschinenfabrik, Berthold Geipel GmbH).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{most common}} energy {{application}} for biogas is on-site power generation using gas engine units. The {{introduction of a}} bottoming cycle based on Scroll expander Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technology within a biogas plant is of high interest since the excess heat produced by biogas engines {{can be used to}} produce additional power. This paper describes the retrofit of a plant consisting of a digester fed with green municipal wastes and two biogas engine units (200 kWe each). The waste heat from <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket</b> of the first biogas unit is used in cogeneration for the fermentation process and also for heating the buildings of the facility. The objective of the retrofit project is, in a first step, to convert the excess heat from <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket</b> of the second biogas unit by means of Organic Rankine cycles. Onsite preliminary tests from the operation of the 7 kWe unit have been done, allowing performances to be measured over a broad range of conditions.
