5|$|Comstock and {{his allies}} also took aim at the libertarians and utopians who {{comprised}} the free love movement– an initiative to promote sexual freedom, equality for women, and abolition of marriage. The free love proponents were the only group to actively oppose the Comstock laws in the 19th century, setting <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> birth control movement.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{remained}} at Monterrey until late November 1847, {{when he set}} sail for home. While he would spend the following year {{in command of the}} Army's entire western division, his active military career was over. In December he received a hero's welcome in New Orleans and Baton Rouge, and his popular legacy set <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1848 presidential election.|$|E

5|$|As President, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Congress and his cabinet, even as partisan tensions threatened {{to divide the}} Union. Debate over the status of slavery in the Mexican Cession dominated the political agenda and led to threats of secession from Southerners. Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself, Taylor did not push {{for the expansion of}} slavery, and he sought sectional harmony above all other concerns. To avoid the issue of slavery, he urged settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood, setting <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Compromise of 1850.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} contest's graphic design, special postcards were {{commissioned}} by the Danish host broadcaster DR to introduce each of the participating countries before the acts took to <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> 2014 contest the contestants were asked to take a photo of their country's flag, made in a creative way. Austria's postcard {{was the first to}} be filmed by DR, and was shot at the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna featuring Wurst and her stylist Tamara Mascara creating the Austrian flag out of 70 baroque-style dresses.|$|E
5|$|At the Emperor's death, the Byzantines {{had control}} {{of most of}} Italy, North Africa, and a small {{foothold}} in southern Spain. Justinian's reconquests have been criticised by historians for overextending his realm and setting <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> early Muslim conquests, {{but many of the}} difficulties faced by Justinian's successors were due not just to over-taxation to pay for his wars but to the essentially civilian nature of the empire, which made raising troops difficult.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of Crucibulum, which {{contains}} both haploid and diploid stages, {{is typical of the}} species of Basidiomycota that can reproduce both asexually (via vegetative spores), or sexually (with meiosis). Like other wood-decay fungi, this life cycle may be considered as two functionally different phases: <b>the</b> vegetative <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> spread of mycelia, and <b>the</b> reproductive <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> establishment of spore-producing structures, the fruiting bodies.|$|R
50|$|In 1911 {{he founded}} the Baden-Baden Künstler-Marionettentheater, {{dedicated}} to puppet performances. Puhonny and his wife carved and clothed the puppets and designed <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> plays. The theatre was based in Baden-Baden during the winter, and went on tour during the summers. Many of his puppet dolls are displayed {{in the collection of}} the Munich City Archives and the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden.|$|R

5|$|In late 1775, Benjamin Church, the Director General, {{assigned}} McKnight to the Putnam House building, {{one of six}} hospitals of the army's Hospital Department in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He {{remained in}} that division, which supported Washington's army, until, {{during a period of}} great scarcity of medical and surgical supplies for the sick and wounded, McKnight went with other surgeons and physicians to North Castle, New York with Washington's army when the Battle of White Plains began in October 1776. The Continental Army lost the battle, and the British took Fort Washington and Fort Lee, which pushed Washington's ragged army south toward New Jersey in December 1776, which set <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Trenton.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the hero}} defeats the Dragonlord, he triumphantly returns to Tantegel Castle where King Lorik offers his kingdom as a reward. The hero turns down the offer and instead wishes {{to find his}} own kingdom. Accompanied by Princess Gwaelin, the hero then sets {{off in search of}} a new land; this sets <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> events in Dragon WarriorII, which take place many years later and tells the story of three of the hero's descendants.|$|E
5|$|Riel's {{execution}} and Macdonald's refusal to commute his sentence caused lasting discord in Quebec, {{and led to}} a fundamental alteration in the Canadian political order. In Quebec, Honoré Mercier exploited the discontent to reconstitute the Parti National. This party, which promoted Quebec nationalism, won a majority in the 1886 Quebec election by winning a number of seats formerly controlled by the Quebec Conservative Party. The federal election of 1887 likewise saw significant gains by the federal Liberals, again {{at the expense of the}} Conservatives. This led to the victory of the Liberal party under Sir Wilfrid Laurier in the federal election of 1896, which in turn set <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> domination of Canadian federal politics by the Liberal party in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of the genus Cyathus, which {{contains}} both haploid and diploid stages, is typical of taxa in the basidiomycetes that can reproduce both asexually (via vegetative spores), or sexually (with meiosis).

5|$|Roekiah {{insisted on}} {{becoming}} an actress, despite {{the opposition of}} her family, and asked her mother for permission to perform on stage. Ningsih agreed, with one condition: Roekiah could only perform once. When the seven-year-old Roekiah took to <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time, Mohammad Ali– unaware of the agreement between his wife and daughter– rushed on stage and insisted that Roekiah stop singing. Afterwards, she refused to eat until her parents ultimately relented. Roekiah performed regularly afterwards with the troupe.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{intended}} to make Sawyer look like less of a belligerent, as he had generally acted as the antagonist in previous episodes. It also set <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> love triangle between Kate, Sawyer, and Jack. The episode was first broadcast in the United States on November 10, 2004, earning 18.44 million viewers. It received mostly positive reviews, although a few reviewers discussed aspects of the episode that they felt did not blend in well {{with the rest of}} the episode and series.|$|E
5|$|The mid-20th century {{brought new}} forms of music from Trinidad, Brazil, the United States, Cuba and the Dominican Republic to Barbados, and the Barbadian calypso style came {{to be viewed as}} lowbrow or inferior. Promoters like Lord Silvers and Mighty Dragon, however, kept the popular {{tradition}} alive through shows at the Globe Theatre, featuring pioneers Mighty Romeo, Sir Don Marshall, Lord Radio and the Bimshire Boys and Mike Wilkinson. These performers set <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> development of popular Barbadian calypso in the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|World WarII {{changed the}} {{political}} alignment and {{social structure of}} the world. The United Nations (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts. The victorious great powers—China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States—became the {{permanent members of the}} United Nations Security Council. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Cold War, which lasted for the next 46 years. Meanwhile, the influence of European great powers waned, while the decolonisation of Africa and Asia began. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery. Political integration, especially in Europe, emerged as an effort to end pre-war enmities and to create a common identity.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} May 2013, a {{broad and}} diffuse {{cyclonic}} disturbance developed over eastern Mexico and northern Central America, incorporating the remnants of easternPacific Hurricane Barbara. As a tropical wave approached from the east, an inverted trough developed on {{the northern edge of}} the active region on June2, setting <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> formation of a weak surface low pressure system over the southern Gulf of Mexico the next day. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system in their Tropical Weather Outlooks, bulletins issued every six hours regarding the probability of tropical cyclone formation within 48hours. A nearby upper trough created unfavorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis, subjecting the low to wind shear and abundant dry air that kept it indistinct and disorganized. On June5, the environment became less hostile, and the system began to improve in structure.|$|E
5|$|In 1502, James IV of Scotland {{signed the}} Treaty of Perpetual Peace with Henry VII of England. He also married Henry's daughter, Margaret Tudor, setting <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Union of the Crowns. For Henry, the {{marriage}} {{into one of}} Europe's most established monarchies gave legitimacy to the new Tudor royal line. A decade later, James made the fateful decision to invade England in support of France {{under the terms of}} the Auld Alliance. He was the last British monarch to die in battle, at the Battle of Flodden. Within a generation the Auld Alliance was ended by the Treaty of Edinburgh. France agreed to withdraw all land and naval forces. In the same year, 1560, John Knox realised his goal of seeing Scotland become a Protestant nation and the Scottish parliament revoke papal authority in Scotland. Mary, Queen of Scots, a Catholic and former queen of France, was forced to abdicate in 1567.|$|E

5|$|In N'Djamena, the {{simultaneous}} presence of two armies—Prime Minister Habré's FAN and President Malloum's FAT—set <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> battle of N'Djamena, {{which was to}} bring about the collapse of the State and the ascent to power of the Northern elite. A minor incident escalated on 12 February 1979 into heavy fighting between Habré and Malloum's forces, and the battle intensified on 19 February when Goukouni's men entered in the capital to fight alongside Habré. By 16 March, when the first international peace conference took place, an estimated 2,000–5,000 people had been killed and 60,000–70,000 forced to flee. The greatly diminished Chadian army left the capital in the rebels' hands and reorganized itself in the south under the leadership of Wadel Abdelkader Kamougué. During the battle, the French garrison stood passively by, even helping Habré in certain circumstances, as when they demanded that the Chadian Air Force stop its bombings.|$|E
5|$|Joanna is then {{ordered to}} snoop around and {{investigate}} the crash site. In the process, she is captured {{and taken to}} the Pelagic I ship, along with the alien wreckage. Nevertheless, a mysterious alien rescues her and convinces her to sink the Pelagic I with the wreckage and escape. She succeeds and when she contacts Carrington, she tells him that she discovered that the wreckage belonged to an alien race called the Skedar. The situation changes abruptly when the Carrington Institute is stormed by a dataDyne strike team who hopes to destroy any clues of the conspiracy. Joanna manages to defend the Institute and her work earned her enough recognition {{to take part in}} her next mission.

5|$|On July 18, 2007, the Grant Park Music Festival {{partnered with}} the Metro Chicago {{to produce a}} free Wednesday-night show celebrating Metro's 25th anniversary and {{featuring}} indie band The Decemberists with the Grant Park Orchestra. The show featured new orchestral arrangements of The Decemberists' songs by Sean O'Loughlin, who also conducted in lieu of Kalmar. While the concert was free, the front seating sections were reserved for season membership holders; fans of the band got the remaining seats or sat on the lawn. This led Decemberists' frontman Colin Meloy to encourage the crowd to breach the barriers between the seats and Great Lawn {{to get closer to}} <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> band's encore performance, which was without the orchestra. Estimated attendance was 11,000 to 15,000, the largest for any free concert at the pavilion to date.|$|E
