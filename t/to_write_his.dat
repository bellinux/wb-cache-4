5|$|Despite the hectic {{schedule}} {{during this}} short visit, Wolfgang still found time <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>his</b> Symphony in F, K.112 (No.13).

5|$|According to {{writer and}} film {{director}} Jukka Virtanen, Vainio usually wrote his lyrics {{at the same}} time as the music. This is evident in the song Vanhojapoikia viiksekkäitä, written as a waltz and whose lyrics feature an aged bachelor who never got to dance at his own wedding. Virtanen has said that while Vainio worked at a fast pace, songs were never easy for him <b>to</b> <b>write.</b> <b>His</b> work did not become easier when he quit drinking, but it did become more emotional.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Heidelberg, Goebbels {{wrote his}} {{doctoral}} thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz, a minor 19th century romantic dramatist. He had hoped <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>his</b> thesis {{under the supervision}} of Friedrich Gundolf, who at that time was a well known literary historian. It did not seem to bother Goebbels that Gundolf was Jewish. However, Gundolf was no longer performing teaching duties, so he directed Goebbels to associate professor Max Freiherr von Waldberg. Waldberg was also Jewish. It was Waldberg who recommended Goebbels write his thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz. After submitting the thesis and passing his oral examination, Goebbels earned his PhD in 1921.|$|E

5|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} for Hasidic Jews to place kvitelach on the gravesite of a Rebbe or tzadik {{with the belief that}} the soul of the deceased will pray for them in Heaven.

Many graves of Jewish holy men are constructed with special apertures for the insertion of kvitelach.|$|E
5|$|It {{was widely}} {{believed}} that George would dismiss Walpole, who had distressed him by joining his father's government, and replace him with Sir Spencer Compton. George asked Compton, rather than Walpole, <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>his</b> first speech as king for him, but Compton asked Walpole to draft it. Caroline advised George to retain Walpole, {{who continued to}} gain royal favour by securing a generous civil list (a fixed annual amount set by Parliament for the king's official expenditure) of £800,000. Walpole commanded a substantial majority in Parliament and George {{had little choice but}} to retain him or risk ministerial instability. Compton was ennobled as Lord Wilmington the following year.|$|E
5|$|James Pope-Hennessy came to Banagher in 1970 <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>his</b> {{biography}} of Anthony Trollope. Pope Hennessy had published his first book, London Fabric in 1939, {{for which he}} was awarded the Hawthornden Prize and was a well-established biographer and travel writer by the time he arrived in Banagher. Among his more notable works were a {{biography of}} Queen Mary {{for which he was}} rewarded by being created a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1960, Verandah (1964) a biography of his grandfather, the Irish colonial governor John Pope Hennessy and Sins of the Fathers (1967), an account of the Atlantic slave traffickers.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of Tess was {{originally intended to}} be featured as the main antagonist of The Last of Us, pursuing Joel for a year before a final confrontation in which she is killed by Ellie. However, the team {{found it difficult to}} believe that Tess would dispute with Joel and pursue him for a year; this was solved by significantly adjusting the story. Actress Annie Wersching was impressed by the script, and Druckmann's ability to write unique female characters. When writing the game's female characters, particularly Tess and Ellie, Druckmann avoided external influences, such as the media's portrayal of women, as he wished <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>his</b> own story.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{documentation}} of what inspired Nielsen <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>his</b> Fifth Symphony {{or when he}} started to write it, but it is generally understood that the first movement was composed in Humlebæk during the winter and spring of 1921. He stayed at his summer house at Skagen in the early summer. At the end of July he moved to a friend's home at Damgaard to compose the cantata Springtime on Funen, and was therefore only able to resume working on the second movement of the symphony in September, during his free time from his conducting work in Gothenburg.|$|E
5|$|His {{friendship}} with Bears teammate Brian Piccolo, {{who died of}} cancer in 1970, inspired Sayers <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>his</b> autobiography, I Am Third, which in turn was the basis for the 1971 made-for-TV movie Brian's Song. Sayers was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977 at age 34, and remains the youngest person to receive the honor. He was named to the NFL's 75th Anniversary Team as a halfback and kick returner, the only player to occupy two positions on the team. For his achievements in college, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame the same year. His jersey number is retired by both the Bears and the University of Kansas. Following his NFL career, Sayers began a career in sports administration and business, and served as the athletic director of Southern Illinois University from 1976 to 1981.|$|E
