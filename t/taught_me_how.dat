He once commented: [...] "My father <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> to play 'Don't Think Twice, It's All Right'. I love Dylan's words, but even more than that, I {{love the fact that}} he loves words." [...] Smith covered Dylan's [...] "When I Paint My Masterpiece" [...] several times in concert. Smith has also been compared to folk legend Nick Drake, due to his fingerpicking style and vocals. Darryl Cater of AllMusic called references to [...] "the definitive folk loner" [...] Drake [...] "inevitable", and Smith's lyrics have been compared to those in Drake's minimalist and haunting final album.|$|E

500|$|... "John Doe" [...] was co-executive MacLaren's directorial debut. Although she {{had never}} helmed an episode before, MacLaren {{utilized}} information that she had gathered by working with Kim Manners, one of the series' prolific directors. She later noted, [...] "Kim <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> he breaks down a script and prepares his shot list. The most powerful thing {{he said to me}} was that he imagines the show all cut together and sees the movie in his head and really visualizes it." [...] Gilligan later said that MacLaren [...] "really rose to the occasion and really did her homework." [...] The bus crash scene was created with the use of elaborate [...] "smoke and mirrors", according to Gilligan. Over nine cameras were used to film the entire scene. Several of the cameras were under-cranked in order to give the illusion that the bus was going faster than it really was. A steel ramp was buried in the ground to flip the bus. However, the scene was reportedly torpid to film. Gilligan later joked that [...] "You could have stood there and had a sandwich while the thing was backing up: it was so slow." ...|$|E
500|$|Willis {{was born}} in Sunderland, County Durham, {{and grew up in}} the Surrey village of Stoke d'Abernon near Cobham, having moved there at the age of six. His father was an {{employee}} of the BBC, and Willis had an elder brother named David with whom he played cricket in the garden, and an elder sister. In 1965, Willis added his third name [...] "Dylan" [...] by deed poll in honour of American musician Bob Dylan, of whom he is a fan. Willis was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, playing [...] his early cricket for Stoke d'Abernon Cricket Club, where he later became Vice President and Life Member, and two seasons for the Cobham Avorians. He was also an avid schoolboy footballer, but was not a natural athlete and loathed rugby, which was the school's dominant sport. Willis recalled in 2009 that during his school years [...] "in the winter when the muscled brethren were playing, I used to play football with the school old boys. This <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> to drink cider and vomit it up on Surbiton station, and other life-altering lessons." [...] Willis' bowling potential was rewarded with selection for Surrey Schools and Surrey Colts, under the directorship of Watcyn Evans, who would become a close friend.|$|E

(He may have given instructions before his death to destroy his early works).|$|R
5000|$|Chadwick {{was born}} in the suburb of Barnes, in western London, and {{attended}} Merchant Taylors' School in Northwood. While there he expressed an interest in being an artist, though his art master suggested architecture was a more realistic option. Accordingly, Chadwick became a trainee draughtsman, working first at the offices of architects Donald Hamilton and then Eugen Carl Kauffman, and finally for Rodney Thomas. Chadwick took great inspiration from Thomas, whose interest in contemporary European architecture and design had a significant effect on his development. His training in architectural drawing was the only formal education he received as an artist. He recalled: [...] "What it <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> was <b>how</b> to compose things, a formal exercise in composition, really, {{it has nothing to do}} with the building it represents".|$|R

500|$|The main {{themes in}} the album, in Adams words are; [...] "searching for something". The lyrical meaning behind track number four, [...] "Oxygen" [...] is what a person needs in order to survive. In other words, [...] "The person you are with is giving you the air you breathe", and that people in general [...] "need each other 100%." [...] The album's first single, [...] "I Thought I'd Seen Everything" [...] is about keeping an open mind." [...] The theme of [...] "Broken Wings" [...] is about [...] "{{somebody}} who <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> to fly", a metaphor which for [...] "putting your trust in somebody who can give you faith {{and the belief that}} you can succeed." [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] is based upon the affirmation of life and faith, while [...] "Walk on By" [...] warns the listener of distrustfulness. As with other albums, according to Adams, he likes to end the album with a melancholic song, such as [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] in 11, it's not the last track however. [...] "Flowers Gone Wild" [...] touches on the same theme as two songs he wrote in the early 1980s, [...] "Cover Girl" [...] and [...] "The Best Is Yet To Come", are based upon the murdered playboy bunny Dorothy Stratten. But also people with misplaced emotions and their unfulfilled needs, which are pushed forth by the media, which Adams says, leads people to lose their [...] "sense of decency". Adams explained further; [...] "It's a sort of new love affair with an old story, devouring our celebrities and leaving them when we are done." ...|$|E
500|$|Nintendo Power {{honored the}} game in its November 2010 issue, which celebrated the 25th anniversary of the NES. The {{magazine}} listed its box art, which depicts a ninja with a burning city in the background, {{as one of its}} favorite designs in the NES library. The magazine's Editor in Chief Chris Slate was equally impressed by the game's box art. He also reminisced the game's high level of difficulty with its re-spawning enemies and enemy birds that knocked players into pits, saying this game [...] "may have <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> to curse". He further praised gameplay features such as clinging on walls and using ninpo techniques, and he noted the game's cinematic cutscenes, including the ominous opening sequence that featured two ninjas who launch into the air at each other and clashing their swords in the moonlight. He said that [...] "Ninja Gaiden was about as cool as an 8-bit game could be, especially for ninja-crazed kids of the '80s who, like me, had worn out their VHS copies of Enter the Ninja". In a July2011 issue, Retro Gamer listed the game's opening {{as one of the most}} popular ones at the time. The magazine noted how its usage of cutscenes, animations, and overall presentation put the game above most other action titles at the time. While it lauded the controls and gameplay elements, as with other reviews, it criticized the difficulty, calling it [...] "one of the most challenging games on the console". It noted how defeated enemies re-spawn in certain spots, how enemies are placed on the edges of platforms, and the structure of the final level.|$|E
