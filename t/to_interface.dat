5|$|In {{the town}} of Zoah, Edge meets an engineer, Paet, who will trade {{information}} about the Tower for ancient artifacts. Searching an ancient vessel for parts, Edge is captured by imperial soldiers but rescued by Gash. Paet reveals that the Tower {{can be reached via}} the ruins of Uru; there, Edge and the dragon are attacked again by the girl and Atolm. After the battle, separated from their dragons, he and the girl fall into an ancient underground facility and form a truce to escape. The girl explains that she is an ancient bio-engineered being named Azel, created in the facility and designed <b>to</b> <b>interface</b> with ancient technology. After Edge's dragon rescues them, Azel warns Edge that she will kill him if he crosses Craymen's path again and leaves on Atolm.|$|E
5|$|As {{the group}} makes {{their way through}} the damaged ship, they swim through a flooded kitchen. They are chased by two xenomorphs. One is killed, while the other snatches Hillard. As they escape the kitchen, the xenomorph returns and blinds Christie, who sacrifices himself to kill the xenomorph so the others can escape. After Wren betrays the group, Call is {{revealed}} to be an auton, an improved version of a human created by synthetics. Using her ability <b>to</b> <b>interface</b> with the Aurigas systems, Call sets it {{on a collision course with}} Earth, hoping to destroy the xenomorphs in the crash. She cuts off Wren's escape route and directs the xenomorphs towards him. Ripley 8 is captured by a xenomorph, while the others head for the Betty. Wren, who is already aboard, shoots Purvis, takes Call hostage and demands that she abort the collision. An injured Purvis attacks Wren and forces Wren's head to his chest just as the xenomorph embryo he is carrying bursts through his ribcage, causing it to go through Wren's head too, killing them both. The survivors shoot and kill the juvenile xenomorph.|$|E

5|$|Icewind Dale II was {{originally}} {{planned to be}} an incomplete conversion to the D Third Edition ruleset, with many rules omitted. The kit system (class specialization) introduced in Baldur's Gate 2 was to be used, but this idea was later abandoned. Sawyer and several {{other members of the}} team pushed for the game's conversion to Third Edition. The development team was eventually granted an extension, which allowed them to complete the change to Third Edition rules. The Infinity Engine required extensive modification to comply with Third Edition rules, as it had originally been designed for Second Edition rules; certain elements of the rules were removed due <b>to</b> <b>interface</b> and engine issues. The game's interface was redesigned, and all-new art was created. It features new item icons, with new spell icons by Brian Menze; Menze had previously created Planescape: Torments spell icons. Jason Manley, the portrait artist for the previous Icewind Dale games, left Black Isle Studios in late 2001; several new works he painted before his departure were later used in Icewind Dale II. Black Isle Studios artist Justin Sweet was asked to substitute. The game's resolution was increased to a minimum resolution of 800x600, with an unofficially supported maximum resolution of 2048x1536.|$|E
5|$|Ripley {{makes her}} way back to Ricardo, who {{explains}} that the Working Joes, the station's service androids, abruptly started slaughtering the remaining crew, including Waits. He also tells her that Samuels is attempting <b>to</b> <b>interface</b> with the station's controlling artificial intelligence, APOLLO, to cease the rampage. However, APOLLO's defensive countermeasures electrocute Samuels shortly after he managed to open a path for Ripley into APOLLO's control core. Upon reaching APOLLO, Ripley discovers that Seegson, who has been trying to sell off Sevastopol for years, has finally found a buyer: Weyland-Yutani, who instructed APOLLO to protect the alien. When Ripley tells APOLLO that the creature is no longer aboard the station and demands to cease all activity, it refuses due to an unidentified presence within the station's reactor. Ripley arrives there and discovers that it has been converted into an alien nest. She then initiates a reactor purge to destroy the nest, but some aliens manage to escape and begin to overrun Sevastopol. Ripley learns from Ricardo that Taylor was sent by Weyland-Yutani to retrieve the alien, and that she freed Marlow in exchange for the location of LV-426. However, Marlow double-crosses her and takes her hostage aboard the Anesidora.|$|E
5|$|The {{specialized}} hardware of graphics processing units (GPU) {{is designed}} to accelerate rendering of 3-Dgraphics applications such as video games and can significantly outperform CPUs for some types of calculations. GPUs {{are one of the}} most powerful and rapidly growing computing platforms, and many scientists and researchers are pursuing general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU). However, GPU hardware is difficult to use for non-graphics tasks and usually requires significant algorithm restructuring and an advanced understanding of the underlying architecture. Such customization is challenging, more so to researchers with limited software development resources. Folding@home uses the open source OpenMM library, which uses a bridge design pattern with two application programming interface (API) levels <b>to</b> <b>interface</b> molecular simulation software to an underlying hardware architecture. With the addition of hardware optimizations, OpenMM-based GPU simulations need no significant modification but achieve performance nearly equal to hand-tuned GPU code, and greatly outperform CPU implementations.|$|E

40|$|Four {{models for}} the {{determination}} of the homogenized strength domain of running bond masonry in-plane loaded are compared. The first is a lower bound approach, where the elementary cell is subdivided into a few rectangular sub-domains, where the micro-stress field is expanded using polynomial expressions. The second is again a lower bound, where joints are reduced <b>to</b> <b>interfaces</b> and bricks are subdivided into a few constant stress triangular elements (CST). The third procedure is a compatible identification, which belongs to the upper bound family, where joints are reduced <b>to</b> <b>interfaces</b> and bricks are assumed infinitely resistant. The last model is again a kinematic (upper bound) procedure based on the so called Method of Cells (MoC), where the elementary cell is subdivided into six rectangular cells with pre-assigned polynomial fields of periodic-velocity. The first and latter models have the advantage that the reduction of joints <b>to</b> <b>interfaces</b> is not required. The second approach, albeit reduces joints <b>to</b> <b>interfaces</b> with frictional behavior, still allows to consider failure inside bricks. The third approach is the most straightforward, but is reliable only in case of thin joints and strong blocks. A critical comparison of pros and cons of all models is discussed, with reference to a real case study...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{implement}} N-DCF, several modifications {{should be made}} to the radio structure. Traditionally, a network interface has a packet queue, plus MAC and PHY modules.
