5|$|A rumor {{started by}} the devoted Norton caricaturist Ed Jump claims he had two dogs, Bummer and Lazarus, which were also San Francisco celebrities. <b>Though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> own the dogs, Norton ate at free lunch {{counters}} where he shared his meals with the dogs.|$|E

5|$|Austin Hobart Clark {{reported}} that juvenile Cuban macaws were green, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> provide any source for this claim. It {{is unclear whether}} green birds spotted on the island were in fact juvenile Cuban macaws or if they were instead feral military macaws (Ara militaris).|$|E
5|$|Further, the Court {{disapproved of}} the judge's having asked the jury for the {{proportions}} of their deadlock (even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> ask how many were for conviction and how many were for acquittal). In Brasfield v. United States (1926), citing Burton, the Court held that such was reversible error, {{regardless of whether the}} defendant objected in the trial court.|$|E
5|$|Shurna {{submitted}} the paperwork to declare for the 2011 NBA Draft following the season, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> hire an agent.

5|$|Whitman's work {{breaks the}} {{boundaries}} of poetic form and is generally prose-like. He also used unusual images and symbols in his poetry, including rotting leaves, tufts of straw, and debris. He also openly wrote about death and sexuality, including prostitution. He is often labeled {{as the father of}} free verse, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> invent it.|$|E
5|$|Another {{person to}} testify was Robert Havelka, {{who worked as}} a {{security}} guard the night of the incident. Havelka said that the guardrail was too close to the stage, but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage. He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan's fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> see it precisely.|$|E

5|$|Apart from Islam and Christianity, Periyar {{also found}} in Buddhism a basis for his {{philosophy}} <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> accept that religion. It was again an alternative {{in the search for}} self-respect and the object was to get liberation from the discrimination of Hinduism. Through Periyar's movement Temple Entry Acts of 1924, 1931, and up to 1950 were created for the non-Brahmins. Another accomplishment took place during the 1970s when Tamil replaced Sanskrit as the Temple language in Tamil Nadu, while Dalits were finally eligible for priesthood.|$|E
5|$|Benbow's {{fame and}} success earned him both public notoriety and a {{promotion}} to admiral. He was then {{involved in an}} incident during the Action of August 1702, where {{a number of his}} captains refused to support him while commanding a squadron of ships. Benbow instigated the trial and later imprisonment or execution of a number of the captains involved, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> live to see these results. These events contributed to his notoriety, and led to several references to him in subsequent popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne opened conference play on January 6 in a {{match against}} the Richmond Spiders, a team which the Dukes had not {{defeated}} since the Spiders joined the Atlantic 10in 2001. This game marked {{the return of}} Melquan Bolding, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> start and scored only three points in fourteen minutes of playing time. Richmond managed to extend their streak, defeating the Dukes 86–80, while Saunders maintained his nation-leading position and now placed eighth in both blocks and steals. Duquesne then traveled to Dayton, Ohio where they lost to the Dayton Flyers 72–78 in overtime {{in front of a}} crowd of 13,435, the largest crowd the team would see all season. Senior Jason Duty was fouled on a 3-point attempt {{at the end of the}} game when his team was down by one, but made only one of three foul shots, sending the game into overtime. Melquan Bolding scored 13 points in 36 minutes, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> start, and Saunders came into the game now leading the nation in rebounds.|$|E
5000|$|In March 1843 Heinrich Heine {{wrote about}} Thalberg: His {{performance}} is so gentlemanly, so entirely without any forced acting the genius, so entirely without that well-known brashness {{that makes a}} poor cover for inner insecurity. Healthy women love him. So do sickly women, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> engage their sympathy by epileptic seizures at the piano, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> play at their overstrung, delicate nerves, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> neither electrifies them nor galvanizes them.|$|R

5|$|Having {{learned about}} the block-booking studio system that almost {{guaranteed}} the studios huge profits, Cagney was determined to spread the wealth. He regularly sent money and goods to old friends from his neighborhood, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> generally make this known. His insistence on {{no more than four}} films a year was based on his having witnessed actors—even teenagers—regularly being worked 100 hours a week to turn out more films. This experience was an integral reason for his involvement in forming the Screen Actors Guild in 1933.|$|E
5|$|His first acting {{role was}} as Winnie the Pooh for first grade. At 16, he was cast as Judas for the play Godspell, {{and enjoyed the}} experience, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> take acting seriously. He {{attended}} John Burroughs School, a private school in Ladue, {{where he was a}} member of the football, baseball, and swim teams. During this time, he dated Sarah Clarke, who became an actress. His father died when Hamm was 20.|$|E
5|$|The 1957–58 {{season was}} an unusual one for Manchester City, which became the first and thus far only English team both to score and to concede 100 goals in a season. Trautmann played in 34 matches, and <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> play in the 9–2 defeat to West Bromwich Albion, an 8–4 defeat to Leicester City was a record for the most goals conceded by Trautmann in a match in his career, and in the entire season he kept only two clean sheets.|$|E

5|$|Valencia {{finished}} second in their UEFA Cup group, although Villa was not featured heavily and was often an unused or late-match substitute. He scored a late winner against Marítimo and {{was used in the}} Round of 32 against Dynamo Kyiv, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> make the score sheet. The two legs finished in a 3–3 aggregate score, with Dynamo progressing through the away goals rule.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the bands}} that {{regularly}} played the university, including Cream, Jimi Hendrix, and Pink Floyd, they were particularly impressed by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, and recruited an organist, Nick Pearne, {{to match the}} format of Arthur Brown's band. Along with two female dancers, the initial line-up was Hammill on guitar and vocals, Smith on drums, wind instruments and vocals, and Pearne on organ (<b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> initially have an instrument). According to Smith, the band initially played as a two-piece, with Smith occasionally using a typewriter as a percussion instrument; their first gig as a three-piece was in the student union, which lasted five minutes before the group's amplifiers blew up.|$|E
5|$|Author Michael Bradley {{and friend}} Deanna Theilmann-Beann searched for Mussie in the Nepenthe, a boat with sonar technology. With their sonar, they found two creatures they {{hypothesized}} could be two marine mammals, three metres long. Bradley concluded {{that at least}} one creature compatible with Mussie's description lived in the lake, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> investigate the creatures further. Scientists have also surveyed the area and found nothing, though the definitive nonexistence of a Mussie-like creature is difficult to establish because some of the trenches in Muskrat Lake extend to over 60 metres.|$|E
