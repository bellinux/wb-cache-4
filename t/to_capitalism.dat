5|$|Historians like Milcíades Peña {{consider}} this historical {{period of the}} Americas as pre-capitalist, as most production of the coastal cities was destined to overseas markets. Rodolfo Puiggrós consider it instead a feudalist society, based on work relations such as the encomienda or the slavery. Norberto Galasso and Enrique Rivera consider that it was neither capitalist nor feudalist, but an hybrid system result of {{the interaction of the}} Spanish civilization, on the transition from feudalism <b>to</b> <b>capitalism,</b> and the natives, still living in the prehistory.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{evidence}} of industrial unrest targeted at Churchill's activities until the 1970s, there was concern about the possibility during the inter-war years, and the probability of none occurring at all is unlikely. The Economic League was established as a right-wing organisation, consisting mainly of employers, to counteract the rise in communist and socialist propaganda and its associated activities during the Great War. Support for the League was particularly strong among the engineering companies in the Manchester area. While workers in the cotton industries, for example, seemed not generally to take a great interest in the Communist Party, left-wing educational groups and shop-floor agitators, those in the engineering industry—perhaps mostly more intelligent—did do so, and the apparent threat <b>to</b> <b>capitalism</b> and private wealth was more evident to the employers of such people. Among the League's less publicised, more nefarious activities was that of intelligence gathering and the promotion of systematic blacklisting methods. It co-operated with the police and government, infiltrated left-wing groups and used information from disaffected ex-supporters of such groups in order to obtain information about what it considered to be dangerous elements and tendencies, and disseminated the knowledge obtained, usually in a confidential manner. The Churchill Machine Tool Co was one of several companies which during 1936–37 was a recipient of information concerning reports of meetings held by anti-capitalist groups, the past and current activities of particular workers and even the names of those specifically blacklisted. Others who received the information at this time included A V Roe, Ferranti, Metropolitan-Vickers and Fairey Aviation.|$|E

25|$|The Transition to New Zealand {{was made}} easier {{due to the}} {{overexposure}} that the Irish had previously had with colonialism.

Though, the Belgian Workers' Party was not elected to government until the late 20th century, it exerted considerable pressure {{on the rest of}} the political process, both through direct participation in politics themselves, but also through general strikes.|$|E

25|$|Like {{the other}} post-Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, Bulgaria found the {{transition}} <b>to</b> <b>capitalism</b> more painful than expected. The anti-Communist Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) took office and between 1992 and 1994 the Berov Government carried through the privatisation {{of land and}} industry through the issue of shares in government enterprises to all citizens, but these were accompanied by massive unemployment as uncompetitive industries failed and the backward state of Bulgaria's industry and infrastructure were revealed. The Socialists portrayed themselves as the defender of the poor against {{the excesses of the}} free market.|$|E

25|$|Like other post-socialist {{regimes in}} eastern Europe, Bulgaria found the {{transition}} <b>to</b> <b>capitalism</b> rather painful and not easy as expected. State-owned enterprises lost their former markets {{and could not}} adapt to the now free-market competition. This led to massive unemployment {{in the city and}} emigration waves in 90s. Since 2000, Ruse has been continually regaining its former leading status. The urban economics were positively influenced by the 2007's accession of Bulgaria and Romania in the European Union, which allowed deeper cross-border cooperation. The flow of investments through EU funds restarted long suspended projects which were finally completed.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, the Right {{had shifted}} {{to support the}} newly rich in some European {{countries}} (particularly England) and instead of favouring the nobility over industrialists, favoured capitalists over the working class. Other right-wing, such as Carlism in Spain and nationalist movements in France, Germany and Russia, remained hostile <b>to</b> <b>capitalism</b> and industrialism. However, {{there are still a}} few right-wing movements today, notably the French Nouvelle Droite, CasaPound and American paleoconservatives, that are often in opposition to capitalist ethics and the effects they have on society as a whole, which they see as infringing upon or causing the decay of social traditions or hierarchies that they see as essential for social order.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{much of the}} 1980s, Unger {{worked on}} his magnum opus, , a three volume work that {{assessed}} classical social theory and developed a political, social, and economic alternative. The series {{is based on the}} premise of society as an artifact, and rejects the necessity of certain institutional arrangements. Published in 1987, Politics was foremost a critique of contemporary social theory and politics; it developed a theory of structural and ideological change, and gave an alternative account of world history. By first attacking {{the idea that there is}} a necessary progression from one set of institutional arrangements to another, e.g. feudalism <b>to</b> <b>capitalism,</b> it then built an anti-necessitarian theory of social change, theorizing the transition from one set of institutional arrangements to another.|$|E

50|$|The historiography of {{capitalism}} {{can be divided}} into two broad schools. One is associated with economic liberalism, with the eighteenth-century economist Adam Smith as a foundational figure, and one with Marxism, drawing particular inspiration from the nineteenth-century economist Karl Marx. Liberals tend <b>to</b> view <b>capitalism</b> as an expression of natural human behaviours which have been in evidence for millennia, and the most beneficial way of promoting human wellbeing. They tend <b>to</b> see <b>capitalism</b> as originating in trade and commerce, and freeing people to exercise their entrepreneurial natures. Marxists tend <b>to</b> view <b>capitalism</b> as a historically unusual system of relationships between classes, which could be replaced by other economic systems which would serve human wellbeing better. They tend <b>to</b> see <b>capitalism</b> as originating in more powerful people taking control of the means of production, and compelling others to sell their labour as a commodity. For these reasons, much of the key work on the history {{of capitalism}} has been broadly Marxist.|$|R
