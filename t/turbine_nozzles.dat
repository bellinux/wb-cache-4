50|$|Turbine blades are of {{two basic}} types, blades and nozzles. Blades move entirely {{due to the}} impact of steam on them and their {{profiles}} do not converge. This results in a steam velocity drop and essentially no pressure drop as steam moves through the blades. A turbine composed of blades alternating with fixed nozzles is called an impulse turbine, , Rateau turbine, or Brown-Curtis <b>turbine.</b> <b>Nozzles</b> appear similar to blades, but their profiles converge near the exit. This results in a steam pressure drop and velocity increase as steam moves through the nozzles. Nozzles move due to both the impact of steam on them and the reaction due to the high-velocity steam at the exit. A turbine composed of moving nozzles alternating with fixed nozzles is called a reaction turbine or Parsons turbine.|$|E

50|$|The nozzle, {{by virtue}} of setting the back-pressure, acts as a {{downstream}} restrictor to the compressor, and thus determines what goes into {{the front of the}} engine. It shares this function with the other downstream restrictor, the <b>turbine</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The areas of both the propelling <b>nozzle</b> and <b>turbine</b> <b>nozzle</b> set the mass flow through the engine and the maximum pressure. While both these areas are fixed in many engines (i.e. those with a simple fixed propelling nozzle), others, most notably those with afterburning, have a variable area propelling nozzle. This area variation is necessary to contain the disturbing effect on the engine of the high combustion temperatures in the jet pipe, though the area may also be varied during non-afterburning operation to alter the pumping performance of the compressor at lower thrust settings.For example, if the propelling nozzle were to be removed to convert a turbojet into a turboshaft, the role played by the nozzle area is now taken by the area of the power <b>turbine</b> <b>nozzle</b> guide vanes or stators.|$|R
50|$|According {{to simple}} theory, {{if the ratio}} of turbine rotor inlet temperature/(HP) {{compressor}} delivery temperature is maintained, the HP turbine throat area can be retained. However, this assumes that cycle improvements are obtained, while retaining the datum (HP) compressor exit flow function (non-dimensional flow). In practice, changes to the non-dimensional speed of the (HP) compressor and cooling bleed extraction would probably make this assumption invalid, making some adjustment to HP turbine throat area unavoidable. This means the HP <b>turbine</b> <b>nozzle</b> guide vanes {{would have to be}} different from the original. In all probability, the downstream LP <b>turbine</b> <b>nozzle</b> guide vanes would have to be changed anyway.|$|R

The earlier rainbow tests which evaluated various top coat compositions resulted in confirmation of the superiority of YSZ and especially the 6 - 8 YSZ composition. On-going tests are more focused on TBC process and property variations. The prevalent failure modes seen thus far in the various rainbow tests are erosion, foreign object damage and buildup of deposits.

50|$|One of {{the first}} {{production}} cars to use these turbos was the Japanese 1988 Honda Legend and used a variable geometry turbo with an integrated water cooled intercooler installed on its 2.0 L V6 engine. There was also the limited-production (only 500 produced) 1989 Shelby CSX-VNT, equipped with a 2.2-liter Chrysler K engine. The Shelby CSX-VNT utilised a turbo from Garrett, called the VNT-25 because it used the same compressor and shaft as the more common Garrett T-25. This type of turbine is called a variable-nozzle turbine (VNT). Turbocharger manufacturer Aerocharger uses the term variable-area <b>turbine</b> <b>nozzle</b> (VATN) to describe this type of <b>turbine</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Other common terms include variable-turbine geometry (VTG), variable-geometry turbo (VGT) and variable-vane turbine (VVT).|$|R
