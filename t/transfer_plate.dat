40|$|In recent years, {{more and}} more tall shear wall {{buildings}} with a <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> have been constructed. Two major steps are usually needed to analyse and design such tall-building systems: (1). Model the <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> into an equivalent grillage system with beams and slabs; and then introduce it into the whole structure analysis to get the responses (internal forces, deformations, stresses, etc.) of the upper and the lower parts of the structure; (2). the <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> needs to be analysed using finite element method with its loads which {{are the same as}} the internal forces of the adjacent members at the interface between the <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> and the upper structure. This practical design method does not consider the interaction between the <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> and the shear walls. With the interaction effect, the tall building acts as a whole to stand the loading. The internal forces and also the stress in the <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> will decrease significantly after taking the interaction effect into consideration, which is of great benefit to the concrete structure design. This approach is to investigate into the characteristics and the influence of the interaction effect. This results in {{a better understanding of the}} stress and moment distribution in the <b>transfer</b> <b>plate,</b> so that a design guideline of the transfer plates may be developed. A series of models with <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> supporting shear wall are constructed in the analysis, where the influence factors such as upper structure stiffness, wall layout and location, column stiffness, plate thickness are included, etc. The whole model consisting of the entire structure and the separated model consisting of only the <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> subjected to the equivalent loading are compared. After analysing the whole structure using finite element approximation programme, which employs element with drilling degree for the <b>transfer</b> <b>plate,</b> and also comparing with the results from the corresponding separated model, some conclusions can be drawn: 1. The effective interaction zone has the height about the same as the span distance of the <b>transfer</b> <b>plate.</b> Beyond this height, there is little influence of interaction on the upper structure. 2. The internal forces and the normal stress in the plate decrease significantly after considering the interaction effect. The neutral axis in the plate moves upward considering the interaction. Without considering the interaction, the practical design puts tremendous amount of reinforcement into the <b>transfer</b> <b>plate,</b> which even causes construction problem. The actual detected stress of the reinforcement is rather low, which means wasteful and unreasonable arrangement of the reinforcement. If the concept of interaction effect can be introduced into practical design, reasonable and economical arrangement of reinforcement inside the <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> will be achieved. The behaviour of coupled shear walls supported on <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> is significantly affected by the deformation of the plate. The internal forces distribution in shear walls does not obey the rule of allocation according to the flexural rigidity. More shear forces and moments are transferred to the compression side of the shear wall. This reflects the possible problem in current design of shear wall members because conventionally their internal forces are allocated according to flexural stiffness. The location of the coupled shear wall has significant influence on the force distribution in coupled shear walls. The programme for the analysis of the whole tall building system is time consuming and also will produce great amount of data which is not easy for engineers to handle. If some loading factors can be introduced, according to the actual axial force distribution in the upper structure members, to represent the reasonable loading acting on the <b>transfer</b> <b>plate,</b> it could be easier for engineers to do static and dynamic analysis. The simplified model consists of the <b>transfer</b> <b>plate,</b> the support and the factored loading (load is modified using different value of factors according to the different locations on the plan of plate). The loading factors actually represent the force redistribution in the upper structure members due to the interaction effect. The simplified model is a better way to analyse the <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> and it agrees well with the result from analysing the whole structure...|$|E
40|$|The current {{practice}} of {{design for a}} transfer plate-shear wall system in tall buildings does not generally include the interaction effect of the <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> and the supported shear walls on the structural behaviour of the system.

In this paper, analysis and structural behaviour of transfer plates supporting in-plane loaded shear walls are presented, where {{emphasis is placed on}} the interaction between the <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> and the supported shear walls. The interaction effect is shown to cause significant stress redistributions both in the <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> and in the shear walls within an interactive zone.

40|$|The {{reinforced}} concrete building considered {{in this study}} has 34 typical floors above a 2. 7 m thick <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> and a three-level podium. The <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> is a {{reinforced concrete}} thick plate that transfers the loads from the walls at the typical floors to widely spaced columns in the three-level podium. A microconcrete model representing the high-rise building was constructed in 1 : 20 scale. Shaking table tests were conducted and the model was subjected to earthquake actions representing minor, moderate, major, and supermajor earthquakes for a region of moderate seismicity, with basic seismic intensity at the VIIth degree pursuant to GB 50011 - 2001. Seismic performance was qualitatively assessed, and it is predicted that the prototype building will not collapse when subjected to major earthquakes. The majority of the damage and failure occurred at the story above the <b>transfer</b> <b>plate.</b> To minimize the damage, it is desirable to strengthen the walls between the 4 th and 15 th floors as well as reducing any change in stiffness within the <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> zone.

However after the occurrence of 2004 Tsunami, and considering possible environmental changers and recently observed small scale ground motions, it is advisable to consider Sri Lanka as low seismic zone. With the current trend of "Mixed Development Concept" high- rise buildings with transfer plates are common form in the vicinity as far as apartment buildings are concerned. The consequences in an event of an earthquake can be serious or even fatal {{for this type of}} highly irregular buildings and adoption of earthquake detailing alone would not adequate. Therefore, approach is needed in order to enhance the earthquake resistance at the conceptual design stage. This study has been carried out in order to identify the effects on the seismic performance of the building when the level of the <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> changes. Accordingly, five number of thirty five storied apartment buildings with <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> located at different levels were considered in the analysis. It is observed that building codes provide criteria to classify the vertically irregular structures and suggest dynamic analysis to arrive at design lateral forces. In this context, the buildings under this study were subjected to response spectrum analysis according to the design spectrum given in the UBC 97. Computer simulation has become an efficient tool in the analysis of structures under extreme loading. Therefore, three dimensional computer models generated with the help of SAP 2000 were used in this study.

40|$|This {{study is}} devoted to {{improving}} the heating to oil shale particles and in turn the yield and quality of shale oil in fixed bed reactors indirectly heated through use of internals. Metallic heating plates were vertically welded on the reactor wall as heating enhancement internals to provide extra heating surfaces inside the oil shale bed and to increase the high-temperature heating surface area by 35 % to 210 %. Comparison of heating rate to particles and shale oil yield was made between the reactors without and with the plate internals. Utilizing internals evidently enhanced the heating to oil shale particles and shortened pyrolysis time by 30 % to 50 %. The shale oil yield increased by 7 % to reach 90 % of the Fischer Assay oil yield (8. 98 wt. %, dry base) when the heating surface area was increased by 70 - 110 %. With increased heating surface area above 110 %, the shale oil yield manifested conversely a slight decrease. Nonetheless, the fraction of light oil (boiling point < 350 degrees C by analysis in simulation GC) was increased to about 66 wt. % from 60. 94 wt. % for the reactor without any heating plate. Characterizing the char samples at different lateral positions of the oil shale bed justified that the flow of gaseous pyrolysis product in the reactor was guided to the vicinity of heat <b>transfer</b> <b>plates</b> to speed up gas exhaust and selective cracking. Consequently, adding heat <b>transfer</b> <b>plates</b> into an indirectly heated reactor would obviously intensify the heating to the oil shale bed and also elevate the pyrolysis oil yield and quality.

40|$|In tall buildings, {{the frame}} and shear-wall/core-wall {{configurations}} make generally access difficult to the public lobby areas at the lower floors of the buildings. Large opening at these floor levels {{can be achieved by}} use of a large <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> to collect the vertical loads from the upper structures and then distribute them to widely spaced columns that support the <b>transfer</b> <b>plate.</b> Transfer plates in tall buildings are actually the very massive and stiff floor plan switchers. Complexities of the stress distribution and deformation behaviour of the plate, as well as the significant structural interaction among the major structure, <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> and supporting system, have precluded the development of a very reasonable, yet efficient and accurate, theoretical treatment for the analysis of <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> structures. In this thesis, a systematic study is presented {{for the development of a}} new flat shell element that is tailored to the analysis of transfer plates that connecting to frame structures and shear walls/core walls. To develop this flat shell element, an eight-node arbitrary quadrilateral membrane element with drilling degrees of freedom is first derived. The reason of introducing drilling degrees to both comer and mid nodes of the element is to achieve the mesh with a more reasonable element aspect ratio. Moreover, incorporating drilling degrees to the mid nodes of the element will lead to the finite element formulation that includes higher-order shape functions, which is needed when modelling the complex in-plane structural behaviour of the transfer plates. A new Reissner-Mindlin plate element is then developed, in which the boundary segment interpolation using Timoshenko's beam function is employed for derivation. This analytical interpolation can ensure that the high accuracy and efficiency of modelling the bending stiffness of a <b>transfer</b> <b>plate</b> are obtained when using the proposed Reissner-Mindlin plate element. Moreover, an independent shear strain approximation is used in deriving the proposed element; thus the problem of shear locking can effectively be removed. By integrating the proposed arbitrary quadrilateral membrane element with drilling degrees and the new Reissner-Mindlin plate element, the development of an eight-node flat shell element with six degrees of freedom at each node is presented. The procedure of integration and derivation for the proposed flat shell element is based on the fact that for a flat shell the in-plane displacements prescribed for the in-plane forces will have no effect on the out-of-plane displacements prescribed for the out-of-plane forces, and vice versa. This eight-node flat shell element is developed and tailored to the analysis of transfer plates that are connected to frame structures and shear walls/core walls in tall buildings. The study of the thesis is further extended from the static analysis of transfer plates to cover the dynamic analysis of plate structures using a new space-time finite element. This space-time finite element is developed based on the proposed unconventional Hamilton's variational principle and is derived using the new Reissner-Mindlin plate element for spatial domain discretization. It has been shown that the proposed space-time finite element can provide an unconditionally stable, higher-order and accurate algorithm for the dynamic analysis of plate structures. A prototype system for the development of a computer package for the analysis and design of transfer plates is finally presented. It describes the details of the implementation of both static and dynamic analyses of transfer plates using the proposed flat shell element and space-time finite element. Accordingly, the computer software has been developed on the AutoDESK ObjectARX® graphical platform.
