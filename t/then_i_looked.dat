Kerslake prepared five treatments during July and August 1993, but no shoot arrangements were made {{and by the end}} of the month, the group decided to work with Dutch photographer and video director Anton Corbijn. Corbijn, who typically created his own ideas for videos, was initially unsure of directing the video since Cobain's treatment was so detailed. Corbijn said, [...] "But <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at it and I thought that actually it was pretty good. I was very amazed by somebody writing a song and having those ideas as precise as he did." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{got into}} a slight panic. None of the letters looked like Bembo! For a moment I froze {{in front of the}} computer, {{thinking}} about writing a letter of complaint to the company for sending us the wrong font. After a while I checked the Bembo Italic and I slowly began to realise that the fonts were Bembo. I calmed down enough to recall that the typeface was originally designed for metal type, and most of the specimens and texts I saw were set in metal type in text size. That was why the images of the characters did not overlap. I knew that a metal typeface was cut or designed separately for each size, but a film composition or digital face is a kind of compromise having proportions designed for reduction and enlargement. I was overwhelmed to see the huge gap. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> into the types used in Western offset-litho prints to see the digital Bembo types in use... the types that were originally designed for hot-metal often looked too light and feeble... Bembo Book is more or less what I expected." ...|$|E

500|$|... "One Wonderful Day" [...] also {{introduced}} the second-season mystery surrounding Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard) and Matthew Applewhite (Mehcad Brooks). Cherry revealed, [...] "they {{come on the}} street; they seem like nice people — but they've got a secret. And it's pretty gothic. It's real and human and awful {{all at the same}} time." [...] Another scene featuring the Applewhite family, in which Betty brings food to a prisoner in their basement, was cut from this episode but was used in the second season premiere, [...] "Next". Cherry's inspiration for the Lynette storyline came from his own childhood experience when his mother returned to work. He commented: [...] "The predicament of any working woman is that you can love your career, but there is something... to be said for getting to stay home every day with your kids, and you don't want anyone else to be better at it than you are. Felicity Huffman expressed satisfaction with how her storyline was handled, explaining that Lynette [...] "didn't deal with [...] in the most straightforward way, but she was fighting for her family. They were noble motives." [...] While discussing the courtroom scene in which Carlos attacks John, Ricardo Antonio Chavira commented: [...] "People can see the full rage that is in my character. I'm yelling at him, 'I'm gonna kill you'... Then I broke into Spanish: [...] "Yo voy a matar!"... I just went for it... <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked,</b> and Jesse [...] had the most honest look of sheer terror. I think I scared the living shit out of him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{the studio}} wanted Gilliam {{to update the}} book for the 1990s, which he considered, [...] "And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at the film and said, 'No, that's apologizing. I don't want to {{apologize}} for this thing. It is what it is.' It's an artifact. If it's an accurate representation of that book, which I thought was an accurate representation of a particular time and place and people." [...] Terry Gilliam, while speaking to Sight & Sound magazine, highlighted if he had updated the movie to the 1990s it would just [...] "be a story about two people going to excess" [...] by keeping it set in the 70's, using {{the backdrop of the}} Vietnam War and a perceived loss of the American dream, offers reasoning to the characters actions.|$|E

40|$|The {{starting}} point of my thesis is that literary critics classify Paul Auster's Moon Palace and Don Delillo's White Noise in quite different ways. Some of them point at clear postmodern traits, referring to postmodern authors and ideas. Other critics, however, refuse such postmodern connotations, and stress the American (literary) tradition or the link with systems theory. In order to investigate these diverging views, I first deal {{with the concept of}} genre, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at four theorists (Baudrillard, Derrida, Lacan, Lyotard), and finally I deal with American approaches to literature (systems theory, Romanticism). I discuss the aforementioned theorists, and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> for traces of their theories in the two novels...|$|R

40|$|For those {{familiar}} only with libertarians {{on the economic}} right, it seems obvious that libertarians will oppose basic income proposals. However, {{there are a variety}} of ways to argue for basic income proposals from within a “left” or “egalitarian” libertarian framework. In this article I argue that such a framework ought to be preferred to the alternative right-libertarian framework. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at a simple left-libertarian argument for basic income proposals that is inspired by Thomas Paine and Henry George, and at another, more complex, argument offered by Phillipe Van Parijs. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} use of Monte Carlo {{simulation}} techniques {{in the field of}} econometrics, specifically statistical inference. First, I examine several estimators by deriving properties explicitly and generate their distributions through simulations. Here, simulations are used to illustrate and support the analytical results. <b>Then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at test statistics where derivations are costly because of the sensitivity of their critical values to the data generating processes. Simulations here establish significance and necessity for drawing statistical inference. Overall, the paper examines when and how simulations are needed in studying econometric theories...|$|R

40|$|Galaxy {{formation}} {{is still a}} current topic in astronomy. An important tool to understanding it is through simulation, which allows galaxies to be studied from all angles and across time. It allows us to explore the gap between observation and theory, {{but only if the}} results are sufficiently accurate. In this thesis <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at the majority of the simulation pipeline from running through the various stages of analysis, and some of the limits of their accuracy, and the fidelity of the subsequent analysis tools. It starts by looking at running simulations from initial conditions, and what influence changing parameters and simulation engines has on the outcome. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> in detail at how successful subhalo detection is by comparing a number of substructure finders, and examining their strengths and weaknesses. Following this I focus on a single parameter recovered for such haloes, the spin, and how well it was recovered, and what it tells us about the spin of substructures. Following this I investigated the building of merger trees, by writing my own merger tree program, and comparing it with some of the established ones. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at using these processes as input to semi-analytic models, and how mass changes could affect the outcome. Finally I used a number of these tools to investigate the fate of some of the larger haloes formed at early times in an attempt to show where ultra-compact dwarf galaxies are formed and their fate...|$|R
