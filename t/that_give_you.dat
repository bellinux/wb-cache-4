The episode {{was shot in}} the second half of July 2010. Hunt later tweeted on-set photos in January 2011. At San Diego Comic-Con International during the summer leading up to the season premiere, actress Jasika Nicole told the audience they would finally be able to see her character's apartment, which has previously been only alluded to in an early season two episode. She explained, [...] "It's really neat! [...] There's all these tiny little things <b>that</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> insight into how things are.

500|$|Both Anupama Chopra of NDTV and Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff.com gave Enthiran {{a rating}} of {{three and a half}} out of five stars. Chopra criticised the film's {{portions}} in the second half, describing them as [...] "needlessly stretched and cacophonous", but concluded her review by saying, [...] "Robot rides on Rajinikanth's shoulders and he never stoops under the burden. Aided by snazzy clothes, make-up and special effects, he makes Chitti endearing." [...] Srinivasan, however, said that Shankar [...] "strikes the balance between science fiction and masala quotient." [...] She concluded that, [...] "Whichever way you look at it, [...] is one of those rare films <b>that</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> just enough material to pull you in, and enjoy yourself." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-News18 gave {{a rating of}} three out of five stars and said, [...] "In the end, it's the fantastic special effects and an inspired performance from [...] that keeps the film fresh." [...] Mayank Shekhar, writing for Hindustan Times, rated it three stars and said, [...] "Leave aside jokes running on the Internet. This film, just a few feet too long, is fine entertainment by itself." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Ardai {{stated that}} [...] "Unlike many recent CD-ROM upgrades, {{which have been}} embarrassing and amateurish", the CD-ROM version [...] "has the stamp of quality all over it", with the added dialogue and sound effects [...] "like taking a silent film and {{turning it into a}} talkie ... It's hard to go back to reading text off a monitor after experiencing a game like this". He concluded that [...] "LucasArts has done an impeccable job ... a must-see". In 1992 the magazine named the title as one of the year's four best adventure games. Andy Nuttal of Amiga Format wrote, [...] "The puzzles are very well thought-out, with some exquisite, subtle elements <b>that</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a real kick when you solve them." [...] He noted that the game is [...] "littered with elements that are genuinely funny". His sole complaint was about the game's linearity compared to Monkey Island 2; but he finished by saying, [...] "It's a minor point, anyway, and it shouldn't put you off buying what {{is one of the best}} Amiga adventures ever." [...] In 2008, Retro Gamer Magazine praised it as [...] "a masterful piece of storytelling, and a spellbinding adventure".|$|E

500|$|Tom Young from BBC Music {{said that}} he did not see the actual {{performances}} on the tour and felt that [...] "some of the magnitude of the performance is lost and the track/scene changes appear needlessly long-winded. [...] As far as live albums go, this is a job well done." [...] Stephen M. Deusner from Pitchfork gave a negative review for the album, stating [...] "Madonna herself is mostly to blame. On stage, she draws from a deep well of amazing pop songs and has the money and power to reinvent this sort of traveling circus. So why not try to break down the wall between performance and audience and hold a gigantic rave? [...] Åkerlund gives you everything you don't want from a concert film: incessant quick cuts that you give you no sense of space or stage, overdubbed music and vocals <b>that</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> no sense of performance, and only a few shots of the audience to gauge their excitement." [...] Mini Anthikad-Chhibber The Hindu commented that [...] "Madonna pulls out all stops in this effort turn the world into a dance floor and one just has to doff one's hat to her energy." [...] At the 50th Grammy Awards held on February 10, 2008 at Staples Center in Los Angeles, The Confessions Tour won in the category of Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video.|$|E
500|$|The season {{received}} varied {{reviews from}} critics. Ramsey Isler of IGN wrote mixed {{comments about the}} season, saying, [...] "There {{was a time when}} [...] was one of the funniest shows on TV; it was comedy gold. But somewhere along the line, the show's shine faded, its image was tarnished, and the magic disappeared", but added, [...] "That's not to say that FG hasn't been good at all lately. Season 8 certainly had a few good episodes including the season opener, [...] "Road to the Multiverse", which had a clever premise that was executed well. But after the first episode, the quality of the stories started to decline". He listed [...] "Brian's Got a Brand New Bag", [...] "Jerome Is the New Black", [...] "Go Stewie Go", [...] "Peter-assment" [...] and [...] "April in Quahog" [...] as the worst episodes of the season. Isler praised the [...] "tail end of the season", however, citing [...] "Brian & Stewie" [...] as [...] "one of the better efforts the show has ever put out." [...] In his review for the Family Guy volume eight DVD, Frank Rizzo of DVD Talk said, [...] "The episodes stand on their own, whether you care about the dependence on easy gags and gimmicky concepts or not, because they are simply funny." [...] Rizzo commented on the DVD release: [...] "Fans of Family Guy, or any of MacFarlane's series for that matter, have to be concerned that the very reason the series continues to air, the DVDs the fans buy, are getting diluted and weakened, especially when you're getting less extras, less MacFarlane, and, for the first time, less of the commentaries <b>that</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a peek into the show's creation." ...|$|E

60|$|You seem to know, or {{at least}} very {{strongly}} to conjecture, who those persons are <b>that</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> so much weekly disquiet.

Can you think I will descend to vindicate myself against an aspersion so absurd? God be thanked, we have had many a change of ministry without changing our prince: for if it had been otherwise, perhaps revolutions might have been more frequent. Heaven forbid that the welfare of a great kingdom, and of a brave people, should be trusted with the thread of a single subject's life; for I suppose it is not yet in your view to entail the ministryship in your family. Thus I hope we may live to see different ministers and different measures, without any danger to the succession in the royal Protestant line of Hanover.|$|E

[...] "Pray, my dear," [...] said he, [...] "do not let <b>that</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> any uneasiness; if Amy comes, and you approve of it, you have my consent to take her into the house, in what capacity you please. I am very glad," [...] continued he, [...] "that you have nothing of more consequence to be uneasy at, I fancy you would make but an indifferent helpmate if you had." [...] Oh! thought I to myself, if you but knew half the things that lie on my conscience, I believe you would think that I bear them out past all example.|$|E
