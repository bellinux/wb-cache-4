As few members of the Kalapuya remain and none had the knowledge of how to make the basket, George visited the British Museum to find an example of a basket in order to design the replica. A bronze cast was created and is displayed at Hillsboro Central. The station also includes a weather vane, one of a series of eight on the Westside MAX.

40|$|The optimum {{circulation}} {{distribution and}} hence the maximum theoretical thrust obtainable for contra-vanes fitted behind propellers is markedly dependent {{on the number of}} guide <b>vanes.</b> <b>The</b> outer portion of <b>the</b> <b>vanes,</b> even if projecting considerably beyond the edge of the propeller slipstream, still contribute appreciably to this theoretical gain of thrust. But, owing to the always existing friction of <b>the</b> <b>vanes,</b> <b>the</b> limit of <b>the</b> optimum <b>vane</b> length lies at relatively small diameters.

40|$|Abstract: The {{possibility}} of {{application of the}} advanced hypertrochoid curve in the inner surface of the stator of fixed displacement hydraulic vane pump, theoretically was studied in the last our work. By considering the properties of this curve, sealing action between pressure and suction sides of the pump can be improved. One of the important characteristics of a new profile must be improving of the inertial reaction of <b>the</b> <b>vanes</b> in each position where these vanes have a radial movement because it causes a smooth sliding motion of <b>the</b> <b>vanes</b> and hence, a higher performance of the pump while attaining a longer life of it. Then at this paper, {{the effect of the}} inertial force of <b>the</b> <b>vanes</b> on <b>the</b> performance of the pump with this curve will be studied. The regular motion of <b>the</b> <b>vanes</b> on <b>the</b> inner surface of the stator with smooth profile suppresses the lateral reactional force applied to <b>the</b> <b>vanes</b> and results to diminish local wear of <b>the</b> <b>vanes</b> tip and noise.

500|$|Smart then {{attended}} Durham School, {{where the}} Reverend Mr. Richard Dongworth was headmaster; {{it is not}} known whether he lived with his uncle, John Smart, or with a school master. He spent vacations at Raby Castle, which was owned by Henry Vane, 1st Earl of Darlington, the grandson of Christopher Vane. Henry Vane and his wife Grace, sister to William and Henrietta Fitzroy the Duke and Duchess of Cleveland, had four children, Henry, Frederick, Anne, and Mary. They were only a few years younger than Smart and became playmates, with Anne and Henry [...] "pairing off" [...] with Christopher and his sister Margaret respectively. Although nothing resulted from the match, Anne has been traditionally described as being his [...] "first love". During his time with <b>the</b> <b>Vane</b> family, Smart dedicated many poems to Henrietta, the Duchess of Cleveland. It was his closeness with <b>the</b> <b>Vane</b> family along with his skill for learning that encouraged Henrietta to allow him a pension of 40 pounds yearly, continued by her husband after her death in 1742. This allowed Smart to attend Pembroke College, Cambridge.|$|E
500|$|In January 1646, amid ongoing peace negotiations, Charles {{attempted}} {{to separate the}} Independents from other factions by proposing in letters to Vane an alliance with his faction against the Presbyterians. [...] Vane was not amused by this, and responded {{by pointing out that}} he preferred the rights of [...] "tender consciences" [...] to be granted by Parliament than by the duplicitous king (papers exposing the king's negotiating positions as facades had been captured at Naseby, and had largely silenced the Royalist elements in Parliament). [...] <b>The</b> <b>Vane</b> estates were not spared in the maelstrom of war; Vane's father reported that Raby Castle had been [...] "visited four times", suffering damages of £16,000. [...] In September 1645, the Vanes succeeded in getting Parliamentary approval to fortify Raby.|$|E
500|$|During Smart's younger years, Fairlawne was the {{residence}} of Christopher Vane, 1st Baron Barnard and Lady Barnard, who bequeathed £200 to Smart. He {{is supposed to have}} received so much money due to his father's closeness to <b>the</b> <b>Vane</b> family, his being named after Christopher Vane, and the young boy was considered [...] "the pride of Fairlawn". However, there is some controversy over the exact nature of this inheritance; while some cynically disagree with the reasons for his inheritance, no other explanation has been specified. In 1726, three years after Christopher Vane died, Peter Smart purchased Hall-Place in East Barming, which included a mansion house, fields, orchards, gardens, and woodland, a property that was influential throughout Smart's later life. From the age of four until eleven, he spent much time around the farms, but did not participate, leading to speculations that he suffered from asthma attacks. However, not all scholars agree that he was a [...] "sickly youth". The only written record of events during his childhood comes from his writing of a short poem, at the age of four, in which he challenges a rival to the affections of a twelve-year-old girl.|$|E

The performance and efficiency of a submerged vane is related to its shape. In the present study, physical hydraulic model testing is performed to investigate four shapes of vanes: a simple rectangular vane and three vanes that are beveled at leading edge in 30, 45 and 60 degrees {{with respect to the}} base, respectively. The experiments show that cutting the leading edge of <b>the</b> <b>vanes</b> reduces <b>the</b> local scour around <b>the</b> <b>vanes.</b> Maximum scour depth reduction occurred due to the maximum chamfer at leading edge of <b>the</b> <b>vanes.</b> Based on <b>the</b> results, cutting the leading edge of <b>the</b> <b>vanes</b> is a performance improving and also cost saving modification, too...|$|R

2500|$|The {{town house}} has been {{described}} as having a [...] "flat roofline, rectangular profile and somewhat delicate lintel detail - in addition to neo-classical window spacing and a main facade with spindly belfry steeple". The building has been compared to the Scottish National Library on George IV Bridge in Edinburgh for having a modern style with classical or traditional elements and recognised for Scandinavian influences. The base of the town house features Darney stone from East Woodburn, with the walls being made from Blaxter stone, both of which were brought north to the town from Northumberland quarries. The surroundings of the main entrance are made of Elverwater stone. The stone on the walls was done by retired masons from around the ages of 65 to 80. The clock tower of Nordic influence, which sits on top of the building, complete with a weather vane, shows St Bryce, the patron saint of Kirkcaldy.
