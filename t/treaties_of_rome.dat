On 21 April, civil control of Split passed from the NDH to Italian authorities, followed by the raising of the Italian flag over the city. On 18 May, Italy and the NDH signed the <b>Treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rome,</b> confirming Italian rule of Dalmatia, including Split.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, the European Economic Community and Euratom were {{established}} in 1958 by the <b>Treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rome.</b> The Common Assembly was shared by all three communities (which had separate executives) and it renamed itself the European Parliamentary Assembly. The first meeting was held on 19 March 1958 having been set up in Luxembourg, it elected Schuman as its president and on 13 May it rearranged itself to sit according to political ideology rather than nationality. This {{is seen as the}} birth of the modern European Parliament, with Parliament's 50 years celebrations being held in March 2008 rather than 2002.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 the <b>Treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> {{established}} two, similar, communities {{creating a}} common market (European Economic Community) and promoting atomic energy co-operation (Euratom). The three institutions shared the Court of Justice and the Parliament, however {{they had a}} separate Council and High Authority, which was called the Commission in these Communities. The {{reason for this is}} the different relationship between the Commission and Council. At the time the French government was suspicious of the supranationalism and wanted to limit the powers of the High Authority in the new Communities, giving the Council a greater role in checking the executive.|$|E

25|$|In 1956, Paul Henri Spaak led the Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom at the Val Duchesse conference centre, which {{prepared}} for the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> in 1957. The conference led to the signature, on 25 March 1957, <b>of</b> the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> establishing a European Economic Community.|$|R
5|$|The three {{communities}} were later merged in 1967, by the Merger Treaty, into the European Communities. The institutions were carried {{over from the}} European Economic Community (making the Commission of that community the direct ancestor of the current Commission). Under the <b>Treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rome,</b> the Common Assembly (which renamed itself the Parliamentary Assembly, and then the European Parliament) was supposed to become elected. However this was delayed by the Council until 1979. Since then it gained more powers via successive treaties. The Maastricht Treaty also gave further powers to the Council by giving it {{a key role in}} the two new pillars of the EU which were based on intergovernmental principles.|$|E
5|$|The Italians {{handed over}} the {{administration}} of eastern Herzegovina to the NDH government on 20 May 1941, following {{the signing of the}} <b>Treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rome,</b> which ceded formerly Yugoslav territory along the Adriatic coast to Italy. The Italians did not immediately withdraw all their troops from the region. The NDH moved quickly to establish its authority in the towns and districts of eastern Herzegovina, which included appointing mayors and prefects, the creation of local units of the Ustaše Militia, and deploying hundreds of gendarmes, Croatian Home Guards and Ustaše Militia units from outside eastern Herzegovina. These forces were brought in to maintain order. The academic Professor Alija Šuljak was appointed the Ustaše commissioner for eastern Herzegovina.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> had {{stated that}} the European Parliament must be {{directly}} elected, however this required the Council {{to agree on a}} common voting system first. The Council procrastinated on the issue and the Parliament remained appointed, French President Charles de Gaulle was particularly active in blocking the development of the Parliament, with it only being granted Budgetary powers following his resignation.|$|E

25|$|The 1957 <b>Treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> {{established}} two new communities, the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). These {{shared the}} Assembly and Court of the ECSC but created two new sets of Councils and Commissions (equivalent to the ECSC's High Authority). Discussions on the seats {{of the institutions}} were left till the last moment before the treaties came into force, {{so as not to}} interfere with ratification.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, Artuković {{participated in}} the Croatian-Italian border {{negotiations}} that took place between Pavelić and the Italian Foreign Minister Count Galeazzo Ciano in Italian-annexed Ljubljana on 25 April 1941.

25|$|In 1970 and 1975, the Budgetary {{treaties}} gave Parliament {{power over}} the Community budget. The Parliament's members, up-until 1980 were national MPs serving part-time in the Parliament. The <b>Treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> had required elections to be held once the Council had decided on a voting system, but this did not happen and elections were delayed until 1979 (see European Parliament election, 1979). After that, Parliament was elected every five years. In the following 20 years, it gradually won co-decision powers with the Council over the adoption of legislation, the right to approve or reject the appointment of the Commission President and the Commission as a whole, {{and the right to}} approve or reject international agreements entered into by the Community.|$|E
500|$|Six {{years after}} the Treaty of Paris, the <b>Treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> were signed by the six ECSC members, {{creating}} the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom). These Communities were based, with some adjustments, on the ECSC. The <b>Treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> were {{to be in force}} indefinitely, unlike the Treaty of Paris, which was to expire after fifty years. These two new Communities worked on the creation of a customs union and nuclear power community respectively. The Rome treaties were hurried through just before de Gaulle was given emergency powers and proclaimed the Fifth Republic. Despite his efforts to [...] "chloroform" [...] the Communities, their fields rapidly expanded and the EEC became the most important tool for political unification, overshadowing the ECSC.|$|E
500|$|The first Commission {{originated}} in 1951 as the nine-member [...] "High Authority" [...] under President Jean Monnet (see Monnet Authority). The High Authority was the supranational administrative {{executive of the}} new European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). It took office first on 10 August 1952 in Luxembourg. In 1958 the <b>Treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> had established two new communities alongside the ECSC: the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). However their executives were called [...] "Commissions" [...] rather than [...] "High Authorities". The reason for the change in name was the new relationship between the executives and the Council. Some states such as France expressed reservations over {{the power of the}} High Authority and wished to limit it giving more power to the Council rather than the new executives.|$|E
5000|$|The NDH {{proclaimed the}} <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> to be void and {{occupied}} Dalmatia with German support. But the NDH was prevented from taking over Zadar {{on the grounds}} that Zadar itself was not subject to the conditions <b>of</b> the 1941 <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rome.</b> Despite this, NDH leader Ante Pavelić designated Zadar as the capital of the Sidraga-Ravni Kotari County, although the county administrator could not enter the city.|$|R

500|$|The Council first {{appeared}} in the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) as the [...] "Special Council of Ministers", set up to counterbalance the High Authority (the supranational executive, now the Commission). The original Council had limited powers: issues relating only to coal and steel were in the Authority's domain, and the Council's consent was only required on decisions outside coal and steel. As a whole, the Council only scrutinised the High Authority (the executive). In 1957, the <b>Treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> established two new communities, and with them two new Councils: the Council of the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC) and the Council of the European Economic Community (EEC). However, due to objections over the supranational power of the Authority, their Councils had more powers; the new executive bodies were known as [...] "Commissions".|$|E
500|$|The Axis powers {{began their}} {{invasion}} of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941. Just four days later, a puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia ( [...] – NDH) was declared, encompassing most of modern-day Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern-day Serbia. In accordance with the <b>Treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> signed by the Ustaše leadership of the NDH, {{a large part of}} the Croatian coastline and islands, including the cities of Split and Rijeka, were incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy. The low morale of Yugoslav troops in Split and the uncontested advance of the Italian Army through Dalmatia resulted in a number of desertions. Paramilitary formations of the Croatian Peasant Party ( [...] , HSS) disarmed soldiers. By 11 April, there were no organized military formations remaining in Split, and a large number of police and gendarmerie switched their allegiance to the NDH. With Split under the control of the new Ustaše government, the authorities apprehended 300 citizens they deemed to be political enemies. On 13 April, members of the League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia ( [...] , SKOJ) broke into a number of Ustaše weapons depots, stealing dozens of rifles and machine guns, as well as ammunition and hand grenades.|$|E
500|$|The Common Assembly (which {{later became}} the European Parliament) was {{composed}} of 78 representatives and exercised supervisory powers over the executive High Authority. The Common Assembly representatives were to be national MPs delegated each year by their Parliaments to the Assembly or directly elected [...] "by universal suffrage" [...] (article 21), though in practice it was the former, as there was no requirement for elections until the <b>Treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> and no actual election until 1979, as Rome required agreement in the Council on the electoral system first. However, to emphasise that the chamber was not a traditional international organisation composed of representatives of national governments, the Treaty of Paris used the term [...] "representatives of the peoples". The Assembly was not originally specified in the Schuman Plan because it was hoped the Community would use the institutions (Assembly, Court) of the Council of Europe. When this became impossible because of British objections, separate institutions had to be created. The Assembly {{was intended as a}} democratic counter-weight and check to the High Authority, to advise but also to have power to sack the Authority for incompetence, injustice, corruption or fraud. The first President (akin to a Speaker) was Paul-Henri Spaak.|$|E

The task of the navy, along with the army, was to defend the new state against both foreign and domestic enemies. The Italians opposed the formation of a navy by the Independent State of Croatia ( [...] , NDH), as they considered the Adriatic to be Mare Nostrum (Our Sea). The Germans supported the Italians in this, so the development of the RMNDH along the Adriatic coast was initially very restricted. On 18 May 1941, the Agreement on Military Matters Pertaining to Coastal Areas was signed in Romethe second of three <b>Treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> signed that day. In this bilateral treaty with Italy, Croatia agreed to demilitarize the coastal area entirely, restricting itself to civil administration there. It also agreed not create any naval units in the Adriatic except for policing and customs purposes. By July 1941, the RMNDH consisted of two commands, the Coast and Maritime Traffic Command, and the River and River Traffic Command, and had its headquarters in the NDH capital, Zagreb.|$|E
