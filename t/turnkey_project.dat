5|$|In June 2012, Sea World {{applied for}} a permit to {{demolish}} the Bermuda Triangle water ride system and the interior of its show building. The Bermuda Triangle had been sitting dormant since its closure in October 2010 and had been earmarked by the park as a site for a future attraction. On 12 July 2012, Christian von Elverfeldt from Mack Rides revealed Australia would be receiving a water roller coaster in 2013; leading to speculation that Sea World might have revived its plans. Further development application filings, and reports by the Roller Coaster DataBase and the Gold Coast Bulletin, confirmed this speculation. In September 2012, Sea World asked Austrian firm Dynamic Motion Rides (DyMoRides) to develop a theming and show design concept for the yet-to-be-announced Storm Coaster. DyMoRides was ultimately contracted for the full <b>turnkey</b> <b>project</b> in April 2013. DyMoRides subsequently contracted PEL Creative for creative direction, Full-On Lighting for lighting design, Volume One for audio and visual effects, and Sculpt Studios for theming design.|$|E
500|$|The {{company was}} {{probably}} founded in 1874 (its first {{mention in the}} local address book) as Gebrüder Helfmann, Bauunternehmer by the Kelsterbach-born brothers Philipp and Balthasar Helfmann, a lumber merchant and mechanic respectively, in Bornheim near Frankfurt am Main. While Balthasar focused on the completion of construction contracts, Philipp developed the financing side of the business. Their first major contract was for the University of Giessen in 1878. By the 1880s the company had begun to produce its own construction materials but was still only a regional player. Shortly {{after the death of}} Balthasar, Philipp converted the company into a joint stock corporation, Aktiengesellschaft [...] für Hoch- und Tiefbauten ("Construction and Civil Engineering Corporation", though literally the [...] "Corporation for High - Hoch and Deep - Tief Construction - Bauten). A major development was the contract for the spa project in Bad Orb in 1899, with the corporation not simply erecting buildings but also to provide infrastructure like roads and gardens, to arrange the finances for the project, and to maintain some responsibilities for operating the project after its construction. Also in 1899, another <b>turnkey</b> <b>project,</b> a new grain silo in Genoa, Italy, was both the firm's first international venture and its first project using reinforced concrete. Philipp Helfmann died in the same year, with his son-in-law, Hans Weidmann, taking over as Chief Executive.|$|E

40|$|This {{study has}} been made {{on behalf of the}} Swedish Transport Administration to study the work of the {{department}} National Projects. The Swedish construction industry has for many years been characterized by low productivity. By being the largest purchaser of contracts in the industry the Swedish Transport Administration has a unique opportunity to influence the productivity. In order to improve in productivity The Swedish Transport Administration is adopting a new role in which they will order more <b>turnkey</b> <b>projects.</b> In our study, we will focus on how one department within the Swedish Transport Administration, National Projects, can perform successful <b>turnkey</b> <b>projects.</b> To clarify how the department National Projects can perform successful projects, this study identifies critical factors for projects and their links to different phases of the project. Existing theory regarding projects presents a large number of critical factors but {{there is a lack of}} connection between the factors and specific project phases. Linking factors to phases facilitates focus on and control of the different phases, as it highlights the factors that are important in each phase for project success. The method of the study is qualitative, five project managers were interviewed, in two sets of interviews, on various projects. Also information has been collected from different project documents. The result of the study shows a number of critical factors, both specific for National Projects and also more general factors that can be used in other projects of a similar nature. All factors are linked to the phases identified in the analysis. The result also contains a definition of project success in the department National Projects. This study is a contribution in regards to theoretical knowledge to existing theory regarding projects and practical knowledge for National Projects to use for improvements of their <b>turnkey</b> <b>projects.</b> Knowledge which we believe is useful for National Projects and their future work with <b>turnkey</b> <b>projects.</b> ...|$|R
