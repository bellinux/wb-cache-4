50|$|Louis Ducos du Hauron {{produced}} the first printed anaglyphs in 1891. This process consisted of printing the two negatives which form a stereoscopic photograph {{on to the}} same paper, one in blue (or green), one in red. The viewer would then use coloured glasses with red (for the left eye) and blue or green (right eye). The left eye would see the blue image which would appear black, whilst it would not see the red; similarly the right eye would see the red image, this registering as black. Thus a <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>image</b> would result.|$|E

This technique has been used for <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>image</b> mapping of California's waters using a hydrographic lidar.Drones are now being used with laser scanners, as well as other remote sensors, as a more economical method to scan smaller areas.

The exploration of western Canada received major attention {{with the discovery of}} oil at Leduc, Alberta in 1947 and Canada's world lead in atomic energy resulted in a successful search for uranium deposits in the north. The Survey's methods became more effective, as seen {{with the use of the}} helicopter which greatly accelerated the process of mapping. In 1955 the Survey launched [...] "Operation Franklin" [...] its largest field study up to that time. With air support and under the leadership of Y.O. Fortier the 28 member team mapped 260,000 square kilometers of the high Arctic. The Survey's reputation grew under the leadership of directors G. Hanson from 1953 to 1956 and J.M. Harrison, from 1956 to 1963. In 1966 organizational changes saw the Survey become part of the new Department of Energy, Mines and Resources and as a result new emphasis was placed on the quantitative analysis of Canada's mineral energy wealth. Land use became an important focus in the seventies with the Survey conducting studies of the environmental impact of the proposed Mackenzie Valley Pipeline corridor. During those same years, the extension of Canada's off-shore boundaries to include a new 371 kilometer economic zone increased the Survey's area of responsibility by 40 percent. To deal with the question of energy security the Survey initiated the Frontier Geoscience Program in the eighties. It also became the agent for Canada's participation in the international Ocean Drilling Program in 1984. That same year the Survey participated in the founding of Lithoprobe, the largest geoscience programme ever undertaken in Canada. This undertaking involving more than 700 scientists from, governments, universities and industry uses state-of-the-art techniques to provide a <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>image</b> of the Earth's crust to an astonishing depth of 50 kilometers.|$|E

40|$|Image Registration is {{the task}} of {{aligning}} two different images of the same scene taken from different viewpoints, at different times or with different sensors. Image Registration is a task often performed in processing of two and <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>images</b> before further processing of the images takes place. This thesis will develop a method for registering large <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>images</b> from the PRESIOUS project. These <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>images</b> are created from X-ray CT scans of stones from cultural heritage sites. The goal is to measure the effects of erosion on these stones. The high resolution of these datasets makes it necessary to develop a registration approach that can register images {{too big for the}} main memory. The registration method developed in this thesis is separated into two phases. The first phase does a rough registration on downscaled versions of the images to get an initial alignment, and the second phase does a more accurate registration with the full scale datasets, using the external hard drive to cache data too large for the main memory. The first phase is quite fast, and in most cases provides a highly accurate initial alignment. However, in some cases the registration method fails as the method employed is not guaranteed to find the global optimal solution. The second phase of the registration process is very time consuming because a simple but expensive optimization strategy is employed. The second phase registration method produces accurate results when provided with a good initial alignment...|$|R

The fundamental difference between the <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>images</b> used in the movie and medical imaging were described briefly. The principal of the two types of the <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> imaging for medical fields, the surface rendering and the volume rendering, were also written.

Rapid prototyping, which is a new technology in the medical field, was described with the concept about accuracy that also same in the <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> imaging. The patient dose and the method to reduce the risk were discussed. Image quality of the bone is not so dependent in the Xray tube currents, so we can reduce the tube current to 85 mA and only 48 mm length scan were requested for a jaw bone. These fac-tor lead to the effective dose 0. 3 - 0. 4 mSv at maximum.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} producing <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>images</b> of flow magnitude and direction. The method {{involves the use of}} an ultrasonic vector velocity speckle tracking system which computes 2 D flow velocity maps in real time. This system, unlike Current Doppler instrumentation, quantifies both the axial and lateral components of flow velocity vectors and thereby requires no angle correction. Numerous velocity maps are obtained for successive, closely spaced parallel planes by translating the ultrasound transducer across the flow region of interest. These 2 D velocity maps are processed via commercial graphics software to yield <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>images</b> showing the magnitudes and directions of flow throughout the interrogated volume. We present images from in vitroexperiments with a jet phantom and a 4 mm vessel surrounded by tissue mimicking material. Constant-velocity surfaces obtained from the jet phantom allow visualization of the characteristic high velocity central core, surrounded by cones of lower velocities farther from the jet centerline. Directional arrows superimposed on images of the 4 mm vessel allow visualization of the <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> flow velocity profile.
