50|$|The {{investigations}} of the 1833 Factory Commission were more extensive and more thorough but its report and associated testimony are less alarming than Sadler's report, and although less open to objection are also less frequently quoted from.

The <b>Ten</b> <b>Hour</b> Movement (supporters of Sadler’s bill, through whom most of the worker witnesses had been procured) and Sadler saw no need for further investigation, agitating instead for immediate legislation.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} relationship between law {{and the rise of}} capitalism in the U. S. First, I analyze the changing relationship between labor productivity and pay at the Lawrence # 2 textile mill in Massachusetts between 1834 and 1855. I estimate a model of productivity under a piece rate contract. Results show that {{the relationship between}} changes in the wage and changes in productivity was negative in the 1830 s, slightly positive in the 1840 s, and strongly positive in the late- 1840 s to 1850 s. I argue that changes in relative worker bargaining power, the intensification of work flow, and the importance of liquidity constraints due to the decline of agriculture in the Northeast are the main factors underlying this shift. Second, I study the impact of contract law on state-level economic performance. Using the contrasting cases of Connecticut and Vermont I find that the development of legal thought on contracts was not composed of a single path toward "modernity 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7, as the legal historiography suggests. The Vermont legal system developed outside of the mainstream framework. Using census statistics and histories of labor and manufacturing in the two states, I then argue that this difference {{had an impact on the}} nature of state-level economic growth. Finally, I provide the first economic history of the antebellum <b>ten</b> <b>hour</b> movement. I study the historical background as well as the quantitative effects of the movement via the <b>ten</b> <b>hour</b> statutes that were passed in select states between 1847 and 1855. Using historical accounts, I first give an overview of each state 2 ̆ 7 s <b>ten</b> <b>hour</b> movement. Using the historical analysis as a light to shed on each state, I then use a difference-in-differences identification strategy to consider whether states that passed more stringent laws (which did not allow workers and employers to "contract out 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 of the <b>ten</b> <b>hour</b> law) saw a greater reduction in hours worked. I do find that the <b>ten</b> <b>hour</b> laws had an impact, but I suggest that the movement 2 ̆ 7 s effects were either amplified or tempered according to the strength and tactics of a state 2 ̆ 7 s labor movement. ...|$|R

Within <b>ten</b> <b>hours,</b> the pressure rose to 894 mb (hPa; 26.40 inHg) and later dropped below Category 5 status. That morning, Nora turned more northwesterly {{in response to}} a weakening in a subtropical ridge and an approaching shortwave trough over China. Steady weakening continued over the following days, with the storm brushing the northeastern tip of Luzon, Philippines, with winds of 175ndash&185 km/h (110ndash&115 mph) on October 7. Nora's intensity leveled out around 130 km/h (80 mph) on October 8 as it tracked between the Philippines and Taiwan. After passing within 95 km (60 mi) of Taiwan, Nora turned more northerly before making landfall near Xiamen, Fujian as a minimal typhoon early on October 10. Once onshore, the storm rapidly degenerated into an area of low pressure before dissipating the following day.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} rationale behind legislative limitation of the work day for women in factories. The issue of protective labor legislation for women is analyzed through {{a case study of}} the Massachusetts <b>ten</b> <b>hour</b> law. This was the first enforceable legislation limiting the length of the work day for women in the U. S. Passed in 1874 and strengthened in 1879, this act served as a model for subsequent protective labor laws limiting the work day for women. ^ Conclusions drawn from the case study reject the idea that this legislation was intended to limit or eliminate employment of women in the regulated industry. The study establishes, rather, that the subordinate social and economic status of women was used as justification for obtaining universal regulation. However, maintenance of gender based familial responsibilities was among the desired effects of the law. ^ Legislation limiting the length of the work day and weekly hours in textile factories had broad based support. Initially demanded by mill workers and class conscious labor organizations as an aspect of social restructuring, the <b>ten</b> <b>hour</b> demand evolved into a single issue campaign. Labor leaders continued to assert the right of factory workers to a <b>ten</b> <b>hour</b> work day whereas philanthropists, clergy, and progressive business interests focused on cultural assimilation of the operative population. This latter view prevailed. The legislators enacted the <b>ten</b> <b>hour</b> law as a means of integrating the (mainly) immigrant factory workers into the New England traditions. Long hours of factory labor were seen as inimical to preservation of widespread literacy, a well developed common school system, democratic political institutions and the characteristic 2 ̆ 2 Yankee 2 ̆ 2 society. ^ The state is shown to have intervened in the economy to promote social stability. In limiting the rights of capital and the economic exploitation of labor, the state acted to preserve traditional social characteristics, a social goal that individual firms could not pursue. ...|$|R

5|$|In {{cases of}} serious {{poisoning}} the mushroom causes delirium, somewhat similar in effect to anticholinergic poisoning (such as that caused by Datura stramonium), characterised by bouts of marked agitation with confusion, hallucinations, and irritability followed by periods of {{central nervous system}} depression. Seizures and coma may also occur in severe poisonings. Symptoms typically appear after around 30 to 90 minutes and peak within three hours, but certain effects can last for several days.

5|$|The {{introduction}} of the New Poor Law also resulted in opposition. Some who gave evidence to the Royal Commission into the Operation of the Poor Laws suggested that the existing system had proved adequate and was more adaptable to local needs. This argument was strongest in the industrial North of England and in the textile industries where outdoor relief was a more effective method of dealing with cyclical unemployment {{as well as being}} a more cost-effective method. Poor Law commissioners faced greatest opposition in Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire where in 1837 there was high unemployment during an economic depression. The New Poor Law was seen as interference from Londoners with little understanding of local affairs. Opposition was unusually strong because committees had already been formed in opposition to the <b>Ten</b> <b>Hours</b> Movement, leaders of the <b>Ten</b> <b>Hours</b> campaign such as Richard Oastler, Joseph Rayner Stephens and John Fielden became the leaders of the Anti-Poor Law campaign. The Book of Murder was published and was aimed at creating opposition to the workhouse system. and pamphlets were published spreading rumour and propaganda about Poor Law Commissioners and alleged infanticide inside of workhouses. Opposition to the Poor Law yielded some successes in delaying the development of workhouses, and one workhouse in Stockport was attacked by a crowd of rioters. As many Boards of Guardians were determined to continue under the old system, the Poor Law Commission granted some boards the right to continue providing relief under the Old Poor Law. However, the movement against the New Poor Law was short-lived, leading many to instead turn towards Chartism.|$|E

50|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Peel administration which had resisted any reduction in the working day to less than 12 hours, a Whig administration under Lord John Russell came to power. The new Cabinet contained supporters and opponents of a ten-hour day and Lord John himself favoured an eleven-hour day. The Government therefore had no collective view on the matter; in the absence of Government opposition, the <b>Ten</b> <b>Hour</b> Bill (also known as the <b>Ten</b> <b>Hour</b> Act) was passed, becoming the Factories Act 1847 (citation 10 & 11 Vict c. 29). This law limited the work week in textile mills (and other textile industries except lace and silk production) for women and children under 18 years of age. Each work week contained 63 hours effective 1 July 1847 and was reduced to 58 hours effective 1 May 1848. In effect, this law limited the workday for all millhands to 10 hours.|$|R
