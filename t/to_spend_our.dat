40|$|We use unique {{data from}} an insurer that {{exclusively}} offers high-deductible, "consumer-directed" health plans {{to identify the}} effect of plan features, notably employer contributions <b>to</b> the <b>spending</b> account, on health care <b>spending.</b> <b>Our</b> {{results show that the}} marginal dollar contributed by the employer <b>to</b> the <b>spending</b> account is entirely spent on outpatient and pharmacy services. In contrast, out-of-pocket spending was not responsive to the amount the employer contributes <b>to</b> the <b>spending</b> account. <b>Our</b> results represent the first plausibly causal estimates of the components of consumer-driven health plans on health spending. The magnitudes of the effects suggest important health care <b>spending</b> consequences <b>to</b> higher employer contributions <b>to</b> <b>spending</b> accounts. <b>Our</b> findings are most directly relevant to health reimbursement arrangement plan designs, though our results are still of value to health savings account plan designs.

40|$|We perform robust {{bilateral}} Granger causality {{tests for}} the US stock prices, home prices, and private consumption. The robust test procedures involve {{the use of}} recently developed time series analysis of non-stationary data with possible structural breaks. We find the underlying data to be generally non-stationary and non-cointegrated. The empirical results indicate the presence of bilateral causality between stock prices and home prices and between stock prices and consumer spending. The results show unilateral causality from home prices <b>to</b> consumer <b>spending.</b> <b>Our</b> findings support the reinforcing effects of stock and home price movements on private consumption, {{as well as the}} feedback effect of consumer spending on stock prices...|$|R
40|$|Summary Most of the {{empirical}} studies assessing the R&D-productivity relationship {{at the country}} level fail to consider the possible simultaneity of these variables. Using a 65 -country panel for the period between 1965 and 2005, this paper studies the relationship between R&D and productivity using several R&D indicators. We establish that per capita R&D expenditure is strongly exogenous to productivity. This result allows us to develop a further argument that demonstrates the high social returns <b>to</b> R&D <b>spending.</b> <b>Our</b> estimates also indicate that a 10 % increase in R&D per capita generates an average increase of about 1. 6 % in the long-run TFP. innovation productivity endogeneity economic growth country panel...|$|R
