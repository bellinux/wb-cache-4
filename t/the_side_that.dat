5|$|Like {{the other}} Galilean {{satellites}} and the Moon, Io rotates synchronously with its orbital period, keeping one face nearly pointed toward Jupiter. This synchronicity provides the definition for Io's longitude system. Io's prime meridian intersects the equator at the sub-Jovian point. The side of Io that always faces Jupiter {{is known as}} the subjovian hemisphere, whereas <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>that</b> always faces away {{is known as the}} antijovian hemisphere. The side of Io that always faces in the direction that Io travels in its orbit is known as the leading hemisphere, whereas <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>that</b> always faces in the opposite direction is known as the trailing hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{originally}} {{being told}} by Redknapp he was not of Division One standard, let alone suitable for the Premier League, Primus proved his manager wrong by seizing his chance when other players missed out through injury and suspension. By {{the end of the}} 2002–03 season he had become a vital member of <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>that</b> won the Division One title, winning the Portsmouth fans' player of the season as well as the PFA accolade for Division One.

Primus credits his renaissance to his conversion to Christianity after a friend of his wife's invited him to church.|$|E

5|$|A Test {{match is}} won when one side has scored more runs {{than the total}} runs scored by the {{opposing}} side during their two innings.

5|$|Aside from football, Bell {{was also}} an {{accomplished}} amateur cricketer; he assisted Burnley Cricket Club between 1899 and 1919, and would often choose to play cricket rather than football when the seasons overlapped. He {{was a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>that</b> won the Lancashire League in 1901 and went on to captain the team that won three consecutive titles in 1906, 1907 and 1908. Bell won a fifth Lancashire League title with Burnley in the 1913 season. A left-handed batsman, he also bowled slow left arm. Bell represented the Lancashire Second XI on three occasions in 1905 and 1906. He was selected for two matches against the Surrey and Yorkshire second teams during the 1905 season and on 9 July 1906 he played in the Minor Counties Championship draw with Staffordshire at Turf Moor, entering play as a substitute after Herbert Rhodes was injured while fielding.|$|E
5|$|Certain medical {{procedures}} can also injure the airways; these include tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, and tracheotomy. The {{back of the}} trachea may be damaged during tracheotomy. TBI resulting from tracheal intubation (insertion of a tube into the trachea) is rare, and the mechanism by which it occurs is unclear. However, one likely mechanism involves an endotracheal tube catching in a fold of membrane and tearing it as it is advanced downward through the airway. When an endotracheal tube tears the trachea, it typically does so at the posterior (back) membranous wall. Unlike TBI that results from blunt trauma, most iatrogenic injuries to the airway involve longitudinal tears {{to the back of}} the trachea or tears on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>that</b> pull the membranous part of the trachea away from the cartilage. Excessive pressure from the cuff of an endotracheal tube can reduce blood supply to the tissues of the trachea, leading to ischemia and potentially causing it to become ulcerated, infected, and, later, narrowed.|$|E
5|$|From {{his debut}} onwards, Carrick {{was a regular}} in the Manchester United first team, making more than 50 {{appearances}} {{in his first season}} with them.

The following season he was part of <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>that</b> won the 2008 Champions League final, playing the full 120 minutes as they enjoyed a 6–5 penalty shootout win, with Carrick converting his spot kick, to help achieve the European Double. He has enjoyed continued success since then, and as of 2017, he is the only English player alongside Wayne Rooney to win the Premier League title, FA Cup, UEFA Champions League, League Cup, FA Community Shield, UEFA Europa League and FIFA Club World Cup.

5|$|India {{remained}} unchanged from <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>that</b> played the semi-final, while Australia excluded Ian Harvey {{and brought back}} Damien Martyn into the side.

The Australian openers scored aggressively {{from the beginning of}} the innings as Khan conceded 15 runs in the first over. Gilchrist in particular hit both Khan and Srinath for many runs and reached his 50 from 40 balls. When Ganguly turned to his spin bowlers as early as the tenth over, Gilchrist slowed his scoring rate. In the fourteenth over, when Harbhajan Singh was brought back to bowl, Gilchrist (57 off 48 balls) tried to hit him over the mid-wicket, but was beaten by the ball's extra bounce and caught in the deep by Virender Sehwag. The pair had added 105 runs for the first wicket. Harbhajan struck again in the twentieth over when he dismissed Hayden (37 runs off 54 balls), leaving the score at 125 runs.|$|E

In the next round Nelson were again given a home tie, against Second Division outfit Coventry City, who would be relegated to the Third Division North at the end of the 1924–25 campaign. Nelson made only one change from <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>that</b> had defeated Winsford, with Eddie Cameron replacing Arthur Wolstenholme.

5|$|On 22 July B Company, 2 RAR was {{relieved}} on The Hook by D Company, and subsequently moved into reserve.

However, by 24 July the Chinese shelling had once again grown in intensity, while large bodies of Chinese infantry were increasingly seen on the forward slopes by the Australians.
