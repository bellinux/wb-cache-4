50|$|Woodturning {{and metal}} {{spinning}} lathes {{do not have}} cross-slides, but rather have banjos, which are flat pieces that sit crosswise on the bed. The position of a banjo can be adjusted by hand; no gearing is involved. Ascending vertically from the banjo is a tool-post, {{at the top of}} which is a horizontal tool-rest. In woodturning, hand tools are braced against the <b>tool</b> <b>rest</b> and levered into the workpiece. In metal spinning, the further pin ascends vertically from the <b>tool</b> <b>rest</b> and serves as a fulcrum against which tools may be levered into the workpiece.|$|E

An adjustable horizontal metal rail - the <b>tool</b> <b>rest</b> - between {{the material and}} the operator accommodates the positioning of shaping tools, which are usually hand-held. After shaping, it is common practice to press and slide sandpaper against the still-spinning object to smooth the surface made with the metal shaping tools.

50|$|Almost all lathes have a bed, {{which is}} (almost always) a {{horizontal}} beam (although CNC lathes commonly have an inclined or vertical beam for a bed {{to ensure that}} swarf, or chips, falls free of the bed). Woodturning lathes specialized for turning large bowls often have no bed or tail stock, merely a free-standing headstock and a cantilevered <b>tool</b> <b>rest.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many {{woodworking}} lathes {{can also}} be used for making bowls and plates. The bowl or plate needs only to be held at the bottom by one side of the lathe. It is usually attached to a metal face plate attached to the spindle. With many lathes, this operation happens {{on the left side of}} the headstock, where are no rails and therefore more clearance. In this configuration, the piece can be shaped inside and out. A specific curved <b>tool</b> <b>rest</b> may be used to support tools while shaping the inside. Further detail can be found on the woodturning page.|$|E
5000|$|Bench grinder wheels {{sometimes}} need to {{be restored}} to roundness and given a fresh grinding face with newly exposed grains. New wheels have suitable balance when first made, but whether the balanced state will last after the wheel has been mounted, and (especially) {{after it has been}} in use for a while, is [...] "quite uncertain". It can seem counterintuitive that they could wear as unevenly as they sometimes do, but a slow spin of the resting wheel by hand confirms it by showing the gap between wheel and <b>tool</b> <b>rest</b> varying substantially as the wheel turns. Thus it is normal that wheels sometimes {{need to be}} dressed (neatly trimmed), which is achieved by any of several types of wheel dresser. When bench grinders vibrate excessively, it is usually because the wheels have worn out of round and are thus out of balance. Truing them by dressing usually resolves this problem. Although some consumers might imagine buying a bench grinder and then using it for many years without thinking about wheel dressing, the need for dressing is not so seldom as that. Correcting the imbalance not only reduces the annoyance of vibration (which rattles the wheel guards and shakes the workbench) but also is important to prevent premature failure of the spindle bearings, as heavy vibration beats them excessively.|$|E

In other words, the given data is modelled as a lossless two port terminated in a unit resistor. The basis of the new modelling <b>tool</b> <b>rests</b> on the numerical decomposition of the given immitance data into its Foster and minimum parts. Therefore, the proposed technique does not require any choice for the circuit topology to build the model. Rather, the optimum circuit topology that characterises the given data is the natural consequence of the modelling process proposed in this paper. A main algorithm {{is presented to}} construct the model from the given data. It is expected that the proposed modelling tool will find practical applications in the behaviour characterisation, simulation, and design of high speed/high frequency analog/digital mobile communication sub-systems manufactured on VLSI chips.

40|$|Effective inverse {{analysis}} <b>tools</b> <b>rest</b> on the synergetic {{combination of}} even complex experimental and numerical procedures. This {{is the case}} of methodologies recently developed for the identification of parameters entering anisotropic elastic–plastic constitutive laws on the basis of data collected from indentation tests. The values of the sought material properties are inferred from a discrepancy minimization procedure, which entails the repeated simulation of the test. In this situation, the overall computing burden can be significantly reduced, without compromising the accuracy of the results, replacing traditional finite element approaches by approximated analytical models, based on the interpolation by radial basis functions of a few numerical results filtered by proper orthogonal decomposition. The effectiveness of this technique is demonstrated in the present study with specific reference to earlier investigated elastic–perfectly-plastic materials and is further verified on the more general case of hardening constitutive models. The accuracy of the identification results {{and the role of the}} likely occurrence of multiple solutions are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Complex forms {{made on a}} {{wood lathe}} develop from {{surprisingly}} few types of cuts: parting, planing, bead, cove, and hollowing. Parting separates the wood from the holding device, or establishes depth cuts. Planing is done with a tool in which the bevel below the cutting edge supports wood fibers, just as in a typical wood planer. Beads are a convex shape relative to the cylinder, and coves are a concave shape. Hollowing techniques are a combination of drilling and scooping out materials. The woodturner is at liberty to choose {{from a variety of}} tools for all of these techniques, {{and the quality of the}} cuts improves with practice wielding the tool selected. Turners rely upon three points of contact making any type of cut: the tool presses down on the <b>tool</b> <b>rest,</b> and against the woodturner's body before contacting the surface of the wood, most often with a bevel edge riding the surface of the wood. The objective is to position the tool correctly so that the wood comes around to the cutting edge, generating a thin shaving without chipping or tearing out sections of the wood. Woodturners prefer to use very clean cuts to minimize the time spent with abrasives. When it is necessary to sand the piece, they do so on the lathe, using abrasives held by hand, in an inertial sander which revolves with the wood's own rotation, or with power tools—drills or right-angle drills. The lathe also becomes a useful holding device for carving, burning, texturing, coloring, and finishing the form.|$|E

In this study, the turning of carbon steel was implemented {{to examine the relationship between}} tool wear and the waveform of the cutting sound. Characteristic waveforms were extracted by fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis of the cutting sound. The results indicated that the sound pressure of a specific frequency range increased during the progress of cutting-tool wear. In addition, it was possible to monitor the progress of tool wear by measuring the spectrum of a specific frequency range, even if the shape of the <b>tool</b> <b>rest</b> and the shapes of the work material were different, under certain cutting conditions...|$|E

40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) occurs in ~ 200, 000 {{bifurcation}} lesions annually. Treatment of CAD near bends and bifurcations is challenging and a preferred strategy for bifurcation lesions {{has yet to}} be established. However, a favorable treatment option may be elucidated by a more thorough understanding of vessel morphology as well as local hemodynamic alterations caused by current stenting approaches. Computational modeling of human arteries offers an attractive way to investigate the relationships between geometry, hemodynamics and vascular disease. Recent developments also make it possible to perform analysis on realistic geometries acquired noninvasively. The objective of this work was twofold.

40|$|Traditional {{research}} tools used by libraries, such as encyclopedias and catalogs {{were created}} {{in an age of}} print and information scarcity. They have not kept up with changes in the information world, including an abundance of online information in different formats and the rise of interdisciplinary topics which attempt to solve ‘real world’ messy problems and not traditional theoretical questions. The traditional <b>tools</b> <b>rest</b> on collaboration between OCLC, LOC, private aggregators, librarians and faculty. The search results they deliver offer excessive information with very little guidance on how to systematically sift through them. This makes the research process harder and turns novice researchers towards Google. This paper argues that novice researchers looking for an overview of a research topic are better off starting with Google Books than with an encyclopedia or the catalog. To explore this, the interdisciplinary topic of mindfulness was searched in an encyclopedia, a variety of OPACs, and in Google Books. Google Books returned the most relevant results with the least effort. The searches lead to a host of questions which must be addressed if novice researchers are to use the traditional tools of research created collaboratively by educators, catalogers and librarians.
