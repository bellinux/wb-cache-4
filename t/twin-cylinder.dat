25|$|Al-Jazari (11361206) {{described}} a crank and connecting rod {{system in a}} rotating machine in two of his water-raising machines. His <b>twin-cylinder</b> pump incorporated a crankshaft, including both the crank and shaft mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|In 1812 {{the firm}} {{supplied}} John Blenkinsop, manager of Brandling's Middleton Colliery, near Leeds, {{with the first}} <b>twin-cylinder</b> steam locomotive (Salamanca) in 1812. This was the first commercially successful steam locomotive.|$|E
25|$|The HKS 700E is a <b>twin-cylinder,</b> {{horizontally}} opposed, four stroke, carburetted aircraft engine, {{designed for}} use on ultralight aircraft, powered parachutes and ultralight trikes. The engine is manufactured by HKS, a Japanese company noted for its automotive racing engines.|$|E
25|$|In 1816 Francis B. Ogden, the United States Consul in Liverpool {{received}} two large <b>twin-cylinder</b> marine steam engines from Murray's firm. Ogden then patented the design {{as his own}} in America. It was widely copied there and used to propel the Mississippi paddle steamers.|$|E
25|$|Royal Enfield has {{unveiled}} the 650 cc <b>twin-cylinder</b> engine at the Technology Centre in Leicestershire, England, on November 2017. This will power {{the next generation}} of Royal Enfield motorcycles. Royal Enfield is going to showcase this at the EICMA (Milan Motorcycle Show), starting from November 7 in Italy.|$|E
25|$|The first commercially {{successful}} {{steam locomotive}} was Matthew Murray's rack locomotive Salamanca {{built for the}} Middleton Railway in Leeds in 1812. This <b>twin-cylinder</b> locomotive was not heavy enough to break the edge-rails track and solved the problem of adhesion by a cog-wheel using teeth cast {{on the side of}} one of the rails. Thus it was also the first rack railway.|$|E
25|$|The Lawrance A-3 or Lawrance Model A was an American <b>twin-cylinder</b> {{aircraft}} piston engine. Designed by Charles Lawrance in the mid-1910s {{the engine}} was produced by the Lawrance Aero Engine Company and under license by Excelsior. Weighing 200lb (90kg) the engine produced 28horsepower (21kW). A feature of this engine was the shared use of a single crankpin for both cylinders, this caused vibration as the pistons moved in the same direction.|$|E
25|$|In 1967 American Honda's {{service manager}} Bob Hansen flew to Japan and {{discussed}} with Soichiro Honda {{the possibility of}} using Grand Prix technology in bikes prepared for American motorcycle events. American racing's governing body, the AMA, had rules that allowed racing by production machines only, and restricted overhead-valve engines to 500cc whilst allowing the side-valve Harley Davidsons to compete with 750cc engines. Honda knew that what won on the race track today, sold in the show rooms tomorrow, and a large engine capacity road machine would have to be built to compete with the Harley Davidson and Triumph <b>twin-cylinder</b> machines.|$|E
25|$|The {{first car}} left {{the works in}} January 1897, fitted with a Panhard engine, {{followed}} in March by Daimler-engined cars. The first Coventry Daimler-engined product made its maiden run in March 1897. By mid-year they were producing three of their own cars a week and producing Léon Bollée cars under licence. Lawson claimed to have made 20 cars by July 1897 making the Daimler Britain's first motor car to go into serial production, an honour that is also credited to Humber Motors who had also displayed, but in their case their production models, at the Stanley Cycle Show in London in 1896. The Daimlers had a <b>twin-cylinder,</b> 1526cc engine, mounted {{at the front of}} the car, four-speed gearbox and chain drive to the rear wheels.|$|E
25|$|In 1812, Matthew Murray's {{successful}} <b>twin-cylinder</b> {{rack locomotive}} Salamanca first {{ran on the}} edge-railed rack-and-pinion Middleton Railway. Another well-known early locomotive was Puffing Billy, built 1813–14 by engineer William Hedley. It was intended {{to work on the}} Wylam Colliery near Newcastle upon Tyne. This locomotive is the oldest preserved, and is on static display in the Science Museum, London. George Stephenson built Locomotion No. 1 for the Stockton and Darlington Railway, north-east England, which was the first public steam railway in the world. In 1829, his son Robert built in Newcastle The Rocket which was entered in and won the Rainhill Trials. This success led to the company emerging as the pre-eminent builder of steam locomotives used on railways in the UK, US and much of Europe. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened a year later making exclusive use of steam power for passenger and goods trains.|$|E

500|$|At {{the western}} end of the site is the pump house. It houses the 1861 engine which was built by Easton and Amos of London, to a design {{patented}} in 1858 by Charles Amos. It is a <b>twin-cylinder,</b> vertical condensing engine, driving a centrifugal pump developed by John Appold. A similar engine was on display at The Great Exhibition of 1851 and was shown to be able to lift 100tons of water per minute, to a height of [...] The engine was originally powered by Cornish boilers, but these were replaced in with 1914 Lancashire boiler, with two fire tubes, made by Fred Danks. The boiler is beyond economic restoration.|$|E
500|$|Two [...] <b>twin-cylinder</b> {{diesel engines}} were {{installed}} {{to aid the}} steam plant, the first in 1914 and the second in 1920. They were made by Mirrlees, and were scrapped in 1956. Following {{the demise of the}} steam engines, a Mirrlees [...] five-cylinder diesel engine, which drove a [...] pump was obtained. The first electric pump was installed in 1939, to be joined by three more in 1957, once the Mirrlees engines had been decommissioned. A new engine house was built in 1964, which held two [...] Ruston diesel engines driving [...] Gwynnes Limited pumps, and a third [...] Ruston unit, fitted with a [...] Gwynnes pump. The remaining Mirrlees engine and the first electric pump were scrapped at this time.|$|E
500|$|The {{new owners}} {{embarked}} on a programme of expansion and installed {{one of the earliest}} electrical plants at any colliery in 1900. A sirocco-type ventilation fan made by Hick, Hargreaves, which could be powered by either electricity or steam, was provided. Deepening the downcast shaft to access the Deep mine at [...] started in 1903 and coal was reached in 1906. A massive timber headgear was built over the downcast shaft and a <b>twin-cylinder</b> vertical winding engine, built by Robert Daglish of St Helens, installed in the engine house. Coal tubs holding 10 cwt of coal were wound, six at a time in double-deck cages. The upcast shaft was used for winding men and had a smaller horizontal winding engine. An earlier shaft at the Forge pit was [...] deep and used for pumping water from the workings. A windlass was used for winding at this shaft.|$|E

Most are also {{available}} as three wheelers (single wheel at the rear), like an early Morgan sports car. Some have been fitted with larger air-cooled <b>twin-cylinder</b> motorcycle engines. For transportation purposes, some saloon models were rebuilt into vans using fibreglass reconstructions of corrugated 2CV Fourgonnette rear box sections. The [...] "Bedouin" [...] was a flat-panel wooden-bodied kit car.|$|E
2500|$|Motocross — Such bikes (once called [...] "scramblers") are raced on short, closed {{off-road}} tracks with {{a variety}} of obstacles. The motorcycles have a small fuel tank for lightness and compactness. Long-travel suspension allows riders to take jumps at high speed. Motocross engines are usually single-cylinder two-stroke or four-stroke units, which vary in size from 50cc up to about 650cc. [...] Motocross sidecar outfits have bigger engines, usually four-stroke and often <b>twin-cylinder.</b> Motocross bikes are also used in freestyle motocross.|$|E
2500|$|The Triumph Group {{announced}} {{sales of}} 37,400 motorcycles {{in the financial}} year ending 30 June 2006. This represented a growth of 18% over the 31,600 produced in 2005. Company turnover (revenues) rose 13% to £200 million ($370 million), but net profit remained static at around £10.3 million due to recent investment in production facilities. In June 2009 Digby Jones, Baron Jones of Birmingham, the former Minister of State for Trade, became chairman of Triumph motorcycles (Hinckley) Ltd and the [...] Thunderbird <b>twin-cylinder</b> cruiser was announced.|$|E
2500|$|BMW {{introduced}} the fuel injected F650GS in 2000 following BMW's {{win in the}} 1999 Dakar Rally with a heavily modified F650RR ridden by Richard Sainct. A taller, more off-road biased Dakar version was introduced which included a taller screen, 21inch front wheel and longer suspension travel. BMW re-branded the single-cylinder bike as the G650GS in some markets following {{the launch of the}} parallel <b>twin-cylinder</b> models in 2008.

2500|$|Honda of Japan {{introduced}} the CB750 motorcycle to the US and European markets in 1969 after experiencing success with its smaller motorcycles. [...] In the late 1960s Honda motorcycles were, overall, the world's biggest sellers. There were the C100 Cub step-through—the best-selling motorcycle of all time—the C71, C72, C77 and CA77/8 Dreams; and the CB72/77 Super Hawks/Sports. A {{taste of what}} was ahead came {{with the introduction of}} the revolutionary CB450 DOHC <b>twin-cylinder</b> machine in 1966. Profits from these production bikes financed the successful racing machines of the 1960s, and lessons learned from racing were applied to the CB750. The CB750 was targeted directly at the US market after Honda officials, including founder Soichiro Honda, repeatedly met US dealers and understood the opportunity for a larger bike.|$|E
2500|$|Scott {{designed}} and patented a vertical twin two-stroke engine in 1904, and patented the familiar Scott motorcycle frame in 1908 designed {{to accept an}} engine of the type in the former patent and to achieve a low centre of gravity. The resulting motorcycle was launched in 1908 featuring a 450cc two-stroke <b>twin-cylinder</b> water-cooled engine. [...] Innovative features included a patented two-speed chain transmission in which the alternative ratios were selected by clutches operated by a rocking foot pedal and a kick start also patented. The first few machines to his design were produced by Bradford based car firm Jowett in 1908 and soon after he set up as a manufacturer {{in his own right}} at the Mornington Works, Grosvenor Road, Bradford.|$|E
2500|$|The nose mounted opposed <b>twin-{{cylinder}}</b> ABC Scorpion was {{air cooled}} with exposed cylinder heads. It produced [...] Behind it, the fuselage was of simple square cross section, flat on sides {{and top with}} a curved underside. The main wheels were mounted rubber sprung main legs attached to the upper fuselage and on axles linked to the lower fuselage. On the ground, with its legs compressed the Phoenix sat with its belly close to the ground. The empennage was unusual in two ways. Both rudder and tailplane were all moving, with no fixed surfaces, and all three surfaces were interchangeable to lower the costs of spare stocks. Nineteen years later, Boulton Paul used the same cost saving design approach with the Balliol. The elevators were mounted at the extreme end of the fuselage, the rudder with its trailing edge level with the elevators' hinge.|$|E

A {{vertical}} boiler inside the cab operates at 100psi and supplies two <b>twin-cylinder</b> steam engines: one for slewing (turning) the crane, a larger one for winding the lifting chain. The winding drums can be driven by their gearing at four different speeds. The jib box girder extends below ground in a well for [...] A plain bearing {{at the foot of}} the well carries the weight of the crane and roller bearings beneath the cab resist tipping loads. Water for the boiler is supplied by a pump, which originally drew water straight from the dock and is also used for draining the well. The boiler's maker's plate reads [...] "Marshall Sons & Co. Ltd., Engineers, Gainsboro, England, No.92766"; it is the fourth boiler that has served the crane and was installed in 1953.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{retaining}} much of Lawrie Bond's original {{concept of}} a simple, lightweight, economical vehicle, the Minicar was gradually developed by Sharp's through several different incarnations. The majority of cars were convertibles, though later, hardtop models were offered, along with van and estate versions. Minicars were generally available either in standard or deluxe form, though {{the distinction between the}} two was largely one of mechanical detail rather than luxury. The cars were powered initially by a single-cylinder two-stroke Villiers engine of [...] In December 1949 [...] this was upgraded to a [...] unit. The engine was further upgraded in 1958, first to a single-cylinder [...] and then to a [...] <b>twin-cylinder</b> Villiers 4T. These air-cooled engines were developed principally as motorcycle units and therefore had no reverse gear. However, this was a minimal inconvenience, because the engine, gearbox and front wheel were mounted as a single unit and could be turned by the steering wheel up to 90 degrees either side of the straight-ahead position, enabling the car to turn within its own length.|$|E
