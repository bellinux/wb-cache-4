5|$|In 1989, {{a project}} was started to bring Bodø/Glimt {{back to the}} top league. Among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>issues</b> was to secure better {{training}} facilities, particularly during the Arctic winter. The club proposed upgrading the artificial turf field at Aspmyra with a new field with under-soil heating, in addition to constructing both a new gravel pitch and an indoor training hall with a full-size pitch. The Municipal Committee for Sport and Culture stated that they wanted to prioritize the artificial turf field over a gravel pitch. They therefore proposed that NOK3.5 million be allocated to lay under-soil heating on the artificial turf pitch and remove the turf. New artificial turf would be laid at a later date, when funding could be allocated. This was agreed upon, construction started on 24 October 1989 and was scheduled for completion ahead of the winter training. However, the Football Association of Norway (NFF) stated that the club {{would not be allowed to}} play their matches on a gravel pitch, and the grass at Aspmyra was in so bad condition that it would not be permitted for play in the top league, should the team be promoted. The municipal council therefore gave grants to finance a new artificial turf on the training pitch, which was taken into use in 1990.|$|E

25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>issues</b> of the 2006 {{elections}} is the economy. The high {{external debt}} and internal debt have inhibited growth. Around 75% {{of the population}} lives on less than US$2 a day, unemployment and underemployment are close to 50%, and income inequality is very pronounced. However, {{there have been some}} recent improvements. Real economic growth declined from 7.4% in 1999 to 1% in 2002, then turned around to grow back to 2.3% in 2003, and about 4% in 2004.|$|E

25|$|Research {{indicated}} that BNP voters also held opinions that were {{distinct from the}} average British citizen. They were far more pessimistic about their economic prospects than average, with seven out of ten BNP voters expecting their economic prospects to decline in future, contrasted with four out of ten who held this view in the wider population. In the 2002–06 period, 59% of BNP voters considered immigration {{to be the most}} important issue facing the UK, compared with only 16% of the wider population who agreed. By 2009, 87% of BNP voters identified immigration and asylum as the most important issue, to 49% of the wider population. BNP voters were also more likely to identify law and order, the EU, and Islamic extremism as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>issues</b> facing the UK than other voters, and less likely than average to rate the economy, NHS, pensions, and housing market as the most important.|$|E
25|$|With the Revolution, {{the city}} {{administration}} suddenly found itself without a royal master. On 15 July 1789, {{immediately after the}} fall of the Bastille, the astronomer Bailly was proclaimed the first modern Mayor of Paris. The old city government was abolished on 15 August, and a new municipal assembly created, with three hundred members, five from each of sixty Paris districts. On 21 May 1790, the National Assembly reorganized the city government, replacing the sixty districts with forty-eight sections. each governed by sixteen commissaires and a comissiaire of police. Each section had its own committees responsible for charity, armament, and surveillance of the citizens. The Mayor was elected for two years, and was supported by sixteen administrators overseeing five departments, including the police, finances, public works, public establishments, public works, and food supplies. The Municipal Council had thirty-two elected members. Above this was the Council General of the Commune, composed the Mayor, the Municipal Council, the city administrators, and ninety six notables, which met only to discuss <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>issues.</b> This system was too complex and meetings were regularly disrupted by the representatives of the more radical sections.|$|E

The possibility of Finland's membership in NATO was one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>issues</b> debated {{in relation to the}} Finnish presidential election of 2006, and continues to be a significant issue in Finnish politics. In 2007, Finland made various technical preparations for membership, with the then Defence Minister Jyri Häkämies eager to pursue NATO membership. Nevertheless, public interest in the issue has since decreased. In April 2014, the government announced that they would sign a [...] "Memorandum of Understanding" [...] with NATO on Finland's readiness to receive military assistance and to aid NATO in equipment maintenance. However, Defence Minister Carl Haglund emphasized that this memorandum would not be a step towards membership.|$|E

Caitlin White of The 405 believed the songs as [...] "hold forth on <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>issues</b> in a woman's life by delving into [...] personal experience with them". [...] "Jealous" [...] addresses fidelity and features lyrics in which the protagonist experiences [...] "promises, suspicion and potential revenge". It contains an [...] "uncanny mix of tones and styles", most prominently a morose bassline replete with electronic yelps. [...] "Mine", a futuristic R song with jazz elements, is self-reflective, with lyrics that reference marital strife and difficulties with postnatal depression. The neo soul song [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] is a self-empowerment anthem that decries society's obsession with harmful and unattainable standards of beauty. The song uses audio snippets of beauty pageants which Beyoncé contested in to frame the song in the context of her childhood.|$|E
500|$|There was {{a strong}} and varied {{reaction}} to the episode by reviewers. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone described it as [...] "an emotional rollercoaster that at times may have been jarring or heavy-handed, but overall did what a winter finale should: gave us plenty of surprises, while setting things up for the future". IGN's Robert Canning was [...] "won over by a powerfully acted and directed story" [...] and gave the episode a [...] "great" [...] rating of 8.0 out of 10; he noted that [...] "as is often the case, the smaller stories involving Karofsky and Quinn were more successful than larger arcs like Rachel and Finn's". Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle said that rather than [...] "a million different storylines" [...] {{there were a few}} [...] "really good ones" [...] and added, [...] "It was chaos, but controlled chaos." [...] The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "The sequence in which Karofsky prepared himself for death was, unquestionably, {{one of the best things}} Glee has ever done." [...] He added that it was [...] "all the more a shame" [...] that it occurred in an episode that did not know how to make effective use of [...] "the impact of that moment", and he gave the episode as a whole a [...] "D" [...] grade. In a similar vein, James Poniewozik of Time said, [...] "the beginning of the episode was a very effective 15 minutes or so of television", but said that was also the episode's problem. Michael Slezak of TVLine noted that the show's [...] "audacity" [...] allowed it [...] "to tackle some of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>issues</b> of the day with a headiness and honesty that aren’t merely refreshing, but absolutely necessary", and added, [...] "If I’ve got any complaint with the episode, it would have to be that for a show that’s billed as a musical comedy, there certainly weren’t many laughs, and the musical interludes seemed like something of an afterthought". In a similar vein, Billboard Rae Votta wrote, [...] "Any thoughts that Glee is, in fact, a comedy should be soundly crushed by now. It's a fantastical reality, and sometimes you laugh at that, but other times you cry." ...|$|E

2500|$|Martí's {{writings}} on {{the concepts of}} Cuban nationalism fuelled the 1895 revolution and have continued to inform conflicting visions of the Cuban nation. The Cuban nation-state under Fidel Castro consistently claimed Martí as a crucial inspiration for its Communist revolutionary government. His nuanced, often ambivalent positions on <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>issues</b> of his day have led Marxist interpreters to see a class conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeousie as the main theme of his works, while others, namely the Cuban diasporic communities in Miami and elsewhere have identified a liberal-capitalist emphasis. These Cuban exiles still honor Martí as a figure of hope for the Cuban nation in exile and condemn Castro's regime for manipulating his works and creating a [...] "Castroite Martí" [...] to justify its [...] "intolerance and abridgments of human rights". His writings thus remain a key ideological weapon in {{the battle over the}} fate of the Cuban nation.|$|E

2500|$|Richthofen's {{experiences}} were {{to serve the}} Luftwaffe well in the long-term and he was leading proponent of army support aviation at this time. His own learning curve in the war highlighted several issues that a modern air force would have to overcome. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>issues</b> concerned tactical and operational level warfare. Unlike the Italian officers from the Regia Aeronautica operating in Spain, the Germans put {{a great deal of}} effort into developing close air support doctrine in the late 1930s. Tactically, Richthofen found little need to retain anti-aircraft artillery to defend airfields. He pushed Flak units into the frontline to bolster the artillery units.

2500|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>issues</b> of Solomic {{poetry and}} of Greek {{literature}} {{in general is}} the fragmented nature of the poet's works. [...] The only works published during Solomos' lifetime were the Hymn to Liberty (1825), an extract from Lampros ("Maria's prayer") (1834), the Ode to the Nun (1829) and the epigram To Francisca Fraser (1849). [...] The rest of his works remained incomplete. [...] Solomos was constantly editing his works and was striving towards total perfection of form, making efforts {{to get rid of}} anything excessive that destroyed their essential lyrical substance. [...] His manuscripts do not comprise engrossed works; on the contrary, they reveal all stages of editing, without their latest version being the final one. [...] At first, the poet conceptualized a draft of the poem written in Italian prose and after that he used to start editing the Greek version. [...] Many of the verses are saved in the form of alternative versions, often in the wrong order, some incomplete and with many gaps. [...] The poet often used to write verses of different poems on the same piece of paper. The poem 'The Cretan' (1833), written about the Cretan revolution was one of his most famous poems. It is highly fragmented, however, this adds to the tormented atmosphere of the dramatic monologue because the speaker is a beggar whose life has been torn apart and who is in emotional turmoil, his entire family killed by the Turks.|$|E
