40|$|The {{effects of}} gelling agents such as carrageenan, pectin and gelatin, on the {{rheological}} properties of dairy desserts were studied. According to the flow behavior all the samples prepared with different gelling agents were characterised as pseudoplastic <b>tixotropic</b> materials. The increase in gelling agents {{concentration in the}} dairy desserts caused {{an increase in the}} storage modulus G', loss modulus G''and complex modulus G* of the products. The dependencies between the viscoelastic properties and deformation frequency showed that all the samples could be characterised as strong gels with well-connected network. It was founded that gelatin gels were sensitive to temperature changes and their phase angle was significantly higher 25 °C than that at 5 °C...|$|E
40|$|The main {{target in}} this {{investigation}} was {{to take advantage of}} the reology properties of the <b>tixotropic</b> mixes in Ultra Low Cement Castables (ULCC). The cordierite phase in refractory mix can be obtained using raw materials with magnesium oxide in its composi-tion, such as, Mg(OH) 2 or H 2 Mg 3 (SiO 3) 4 (Talc mineral), with a content of 63. 5 % SiO 2, 31. 7 % MgO and 4. 8 % H 2 O. In this investiga-tion, as magnesium source, a commercial calcined magnesite with 90 % MgO was used. This mineral was selected instead of Talc mineral, because this last contains more impurities in its composition that tend to form more amounts of liquid phases with low fu-sion points. For this work two different ULCC mixes were designed. These were fired at 1260 ºC, the cordierite phase was quantified in each mix...|$|E
40|$|In this {{experimental}} work the rheological behavior of umbu pulp {{has been studied}} by shear flow (pseudoplasticity, apparent viscosity) and in oscillatory mode (dynamic modules) in the linear domain of viscoelasticity. The {{studies were carried out}} {{with the use of a}} controlled stress Rheometer Haake RS 100, at different soluble solid concentrations (10, 15, 20 and 25 °Brix), measured at 30 °C. Tests in steady shear were conducted over a shear rate range of 0. 1 - 300 s- 1 and oscillatory measurements over a frequency range of 0. 01 - 100 Hz. The results indicated that umbu pulp behaves as a non-Newtonian fluid, with pseudoplastic characteristics and yield stress appearance and exhibits <b>tixotropic</b> properties. Rheograms were fitted to the Herschel-Bulkey model. From the dynamic test the umbu pulp showed storage modulus (G') values that were always higher than loss modulus (G"), indicating weak gel-like behavior. Storage and loss modulus increased with increase in the concentration...|$|E

In all tests 7 % of sucrose was added to the ingredients. The rheological parameters were obtained in duplicate at the temperature of 10 ° C using a cone and plate rheometer, and fitted to the Power law model. The samples revealed a non-Newtonian fluid behavior both in the upward and downward curves, typical of a <b>tixotropic</b> fluid. The dairy beverages were submitted to a sensory analysis by a group of fifty untrained tasters who used a hedonic scale of nine points, the extremes being 1 - disliked extremely and 9 - liked extremely, in order to evaluate the following parameters: general acceptability; appearance and color; consistency; taste and aroma. The dairy beverage produced with 3 % WPC, 6 % SMP and 1. 5 % IPS, (treatment 3), was the one that obtained the best average score for those attributes and was preferred by the tasters.

40|$|Piles can be {{classified}} into three categories depending {{on the amount of}} soil displaced during installation: (i) Large volume displacement piles: (ii) Small volume displacement piles and: (iii) Replacement piles. Installation of piles can disturb the soil surrounding the pile and {{have an effect on the}} surrounding area by two different ways: (i) Due to variation of the material properties of the soil surrounding the pile and: (ii) Due to changes in the pore water pressure in the soil surrounding the pile. Magnitude of these variations is highest in large volume displacement piles compared with small volume displacement piles and replacement piles due to the high disturbance in the surrounding area caused by large volume of soil displaced. Moreover. the pore pressure generated during installation process might be dissipated with time depending on the permeability of the surrounding soils and the structure of the soil disturbed due to driving may also be recovered with time. The recovering of the soil structure with time and the equalization of pore pressure with time is termed, "Tixotropic Recover". Time taken for the recovery to complete depends on the amount of disturbance caused by the pile installation process and the properties of the surrounding soil. Due to the strength regaining of the soil surrounding the pile as a result or rixotropic recovery, the ultimate carrying capacity of the pile will vary with time. If the ultimate carrying capacity of the pile is increased due to <b>tixotropic</b> recovery it is termed 'setup' whereas if it's decreased it is termed 'relaxation'...|$|E
40|$|For most {{reason for}} dry {{suspension}} is the drug changes from chemical degradation or hydrolysis like ampicillin. The dry syrups that require mixing prior to administration is solving the problem. These suspension are commersial, dry mixtures {{that require the}} addition of water {{at the time of}} dispensing. Many antibiotics are formulated as dry syrups and are intented for a pediatric patient population. There are usually fewer suspending material in suspension dry syrup than in convensional suspensions. The criteria for selecting inggredients are based both on suitable reconstitution and on physical tipe of powder mixture desired. This research was carried out the possibility of using phycical and chemical modification of cassava starch as suspending material.

Neste trabalho foram estudados os efeitos das variáveis independentes: teor de soro de leite em pó (3, 0; 3, 5; 4, 0 %), teor de leite em pó desnatado (4, 0; 5, 0; 6, 0 %) e teor de isolado proteico de soja (1, 5; 2, 0; 2, 5 %) nas características reológicas e sensoriais de bebidas lácteas funcionais. Em todos os testes adicionou-se 7 % de sacarose aos ingredientes. Os parâmetros reológicos foram determinados em duplicata na temperatura de 10 ºC usando-se um reômetro de cone e placa, e ajustados pelo modelo da Lei da Potência. As amostras apresentaram comportamento de fluido não Newtoniano, nas curvas ascendentes e descendentes, típico de fluido tixotrópico. Os atributos sensoriais aceitabilidade geral; aparência e cor; consistência; sabor e aroma foram avaliados por uma equipe de 50 provadores não treinados, usando uma escala hedônica de 9 pontos, sendo os extremos 1 – desgostei muitíssimo e 9 – gostei muitíssimo.

40|$|The {{rheological}} {{and material}} parameters determining the pumpability of fresh self-compacting mortar {{have been studied}} in full-scale (70 m Ø 50 mm rubber hose and screw pump with max capacity 7 m 3 /h). Concrete pressure gradient over the hose length (dp/dx) and flow rate were measured to quantify pumpability. The rheological properties of the pumped mortars were measured with a ConTec BML viscometer. Finally, the rheological properties of the slip layer that occurs in vicinity of {{the wall of the}} hose during pumping was studyed as matrix phase (paste and filler < 0. 125 mm) in a parallel plate rheometer. Five different concrete mixes were investigated showing that slump flow is not suitable for differentiating pumpability. Interpretation of rheological data was, moreover, complicated since the measured values of plastic viscosity and yield stress were altered simultaneously from mix to mix. The data imply that both yield stress and plastic viscosity govern pumpability. Increased plastic viscosity of mortar and paste was found to correlate with decreased mortar pumpability. No clear trends could be found for mortar yield stress. Increased paste yield stress was, however surprisingly, related to increased pumpability. The plastic viscosity seemed, however, to dominate yield stress when the two factors varied simultaneously within the given workability range. These parameters should, therefore, not be studied independently. Increased hysteresis area calculated from the paste measurements correlated well with reduced pump flow, also indicating a relation to the rheology of the slip layer. The predicted pressure losses were 5 - 7 times higher than the measured values. This indicates that {{one or more of the}} premises of the Buckingham-Reiner equation are erroneous in these tests, like inhomogeneous fluid and slippage. The existence of a plug is due to yield stress which was observed in both matrix and mortar. The combination of instrumented steady state pumping, concentric viscometre, parallel plate viscometer and visualized boundary flow rate were used to estimate slip layer thickness. The modified Buckingham Reiner equation resulted in slip zone thickness in the order of 0. 6 – 1 mm. The thicknesses were not sensitive to variations in matrix yield stress, whereas plastic viscosity had a major effect as shown in plots of slip zone viscosity vs slip zone thickness. At the slip zone thickness corresponding to the matrix rheology, the calculated specific viscosities (Pa•s/m) were all similar to the lowest values reported by Kaplan (2001). The average rates of shear in the thinnest slip zone were estimated to be as high as 1000 [s- 1]. This is much higher than those used in the parallel plate viscometer [100 s- 1] and future parallel plate viscometre test made in conjunction with studies of this kind should be carried out to 1000 [s- 1]. Based on a few flow profile calculations and comparison with visualized profiles it seems reasonable to assume that the rheological properties of the concrete are not constant, but vary over the cross section of the tube and possibly also along the tube due to factors such as <b>tixotropic</b> behaviour, possibly shear thickening, stiffening, wall effects and/or segregation under shear. Some investigations of effect of pumping on compressive strength were made by measuring strength on cubes made from concrete before and after pumping. These showed negligible effects of pumping on strength. Further research recommendations are given. © Copyright SINTEF Building and Infrastructure 201...|$|E
