40|$|Publishing the {{opinions}} online through blog is growing day by day. Visibility of <b>the</b> <b>blogs</b> in search engines {{depends upon the}} page rank or PR of <b>the</b> <b>blogs</b> and PR depends upon number of links pointing to <b>the</b> <b>blogs.</b> Popular blog engines like word press; drupal allows comments system by means of which readers can leave comments after reading <b>the</b> <b>blogs.</b> Over <b>the</b> time automated engines are developed that can find <b>the</b> <b>blogs</b> that support comment system and publish automatic comments with links to particular websites. This is called blogspams. There are several techniques proposed to prevent blog spams but have failed to effectively detect the spams. In this work we propose a unique technique to detect blog spam based on modified TF-IDF algorithm to first find the relevancy of the comments {{with respect to the}} subject and further checking for repetition of thewords in the comments. Generally automated blog commenting or spamming publish the same comments across multiple sites and blogs, therefore this method can effectively detect the spams. The proposed technique is verified with respect to several <b>blogs</b> with <b>the</b> consent of <b>blog</b> webmaster. Results show the effectiveness of the technique against some of the theoretical model {{as well as some of}} the commercially available model like aksimet...|$|R

The text is interspersed with facts about bacon and bacon-related quips from comedian Jim Gaffigan.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{was delayed}} {{in getting the}} website online, Munroe {{had a lot of}} time {{thinking}} about the design of <b>the</b> <b>blog.</b> He eventually chose to display his entries as individual pages rather than using an infinite scrolling page, as he considers the latter more difficult to digest. Munroe usually chooses questions he already knows something interesting about, or after reading a scientific paper, he keeps an eye out for questions in which he can bring it up. Munroe has said that the volume of questions has been high enough that it is impossible to read all of them. Answering a question and writing a post takes him about a day of solid work.|$|E
5|$|Websites such as Equestria Daily and Ponychan {{were created}} for fans to share artwork, stories, music, and {{news about the}} show.

Shaun eventually cut back on his community college classes in order to continue running the site out of his parents' house in Glendale, Arizona, when it grew in popularity.

5|$|In {{the fourth}} round, a Japanese player (Tang Tang) was {{forfeited}} {{after he was}} caught with an electronic device in a random check conducted prior to leaving the venue. The game result was reversed from a win for the player to a loss, which also resulted in {{a change in the}} match score. Chief Arbiter Faiq Hasanov said that he was approached by an arbiter in the anti-cheating department and informed about the matter. He himself did not bother to check if there was a chess program installed on the device, as possession already violated the rules, leading to an automatic forfeiture. Later information from other arbiters involved indicated there possibly were two devices involved, and their quick check did not indicate a chess program was running. Without sufficient evidence of cheating per se, Hasanov felt that more than game disqualification would be double punishment. The captain of the Japanese team GM Mihajlo Stojanović later addressed some of the related issues in comments on <b>the</b> <b>blog</b> of the Macedonian grandmaster and general secretary of the Association of Chess Professionals Aleksandar Čolooviḱ.|$|E

Toward the end of the month on October 26, 0verflow posted that new information about School Days would be circulated in the November issue of Tech Gian, an adult magazine published by Enterbrain.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the nature of pre-service mathematics teachers’ attitudes toward and perceived effectiveness of a blogging activity included as a regular component of a college Euclidean Geometry course. Descriptive statistics regarding participants’ attitudes toward and perceived effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>blogging</b> activity were gathered using a researcher developed instrument. Additionally, an inferential statistical test was performed to determine if a relationship exists between pre-service teachers’ attitude toward <b>the</b> <b>blogging</b> activity and their performance in the course as measured by the eight in-class quizzes administered throughout the semester. Similarly, an inferential statistical test was performed to determine if a relationship exists between pre-service teachers’ perceived effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>blogging</b> activity and their performance in the course as measured by the eight in-class quizzes. The study was conducted in a Euclidean Geometry class designed for preservice mathematics teachers enrolled in a land grant university located in the western part of the United States. The results revealed that preservice mathematics teachers tended to enjoy participating in <b>the</b> <b>blogging</b> activity and perceived that <b>the</b> <b>blogging</b> activity was effective. Additionally, the results indicated that no relationships existed between performance in the course and either attitude toward <b>the</b> <b>blogging</b> activity or <b>the</b> perceived effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>blogging</b> activity. These non-significant results suggest that mathematics teachers who want to incorporate a blogging activity in their courses should not be concerned about whether the students have a strong or weak background in mathematics, as both strong and weak students seem to enjoy and potentially benefit from the use of a blogging activity as a supportive teaching and learning tool...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} scholarly <b>blogs.</b> <b>The</b> aim is to gain an in-depth understanding of what characterizes blogging {{as part of the}} scholarly communication within epistemic cultures. A study was conducted of 16 scholarly blogs, from two different scientific areas. Eight blogs from high energy physics (HEP) and eight from digital history were closely followed. The analysis was made by employing an analytical framework based on genre theory. The results reveal common communicative purposes in the scholarly blogs; there are many similarities in form features and content, which also relate to the purposes of <b>the</b> <b>blogs.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> context in which <b>the</b> <b>blogs</b> are situated is based both in <b>the</b> <b>blogging</b> researchers’ epistemic cultures and in their knowledge about blogging practices. A conclusion is that <b>the</b> scholarly <b>blog</b> is an addition to the landscape of scholarly communication, including communication with the public, and that <b>the</b> scholarly <b>blogs</b> contribute to our understanding of how research is done...|$|R
