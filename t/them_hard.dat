5|$|Beagles are {{intelligent}} but, as {{a result}} of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make <b>them</b> <b>hard</b> to train. They can be difficult to recall once they have picked up a scent, and are easily distracted by smells around them. They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers felt {{part of the}} failings laid {{with the}} {{underdeveloped}} characters despite them being slightly different from usual anime stock characters. The story neither properly introduces them nor explains their backgrounds and motivations, making <b>them</b> <b>hard</b> to identify with. Eko's menace only came by force and not by his personality or schemes, making him a weak villain. DVD Talk {{found it hard to}} piece together the relationship between the main characters, but acknowledged the later half addressed some of these issues by revealing the background of some characters. They felt the revelations fleshed out Otoha's personality and motivation, helping viewers to sympathize and identify with the protagonist.|$|E

5|$|The roads the Muisca {{merchants and}} xeques used to {{traverse}} the Altiplano and access surrounding areas, were dug {{in the top}} soil without pavement, making <b>them</b> <b>hard</b> to recognise in the archaeological record. The roads leading to the religious sites, such as Lake Tota, were marked with stones surrounding the pathway, which are still visible today. Cable bridges of vines and bamboo connected {{the banks of the}} many rivers of the Andes. The roads crossing the mountains of the Eastern Ranges were narrow, which created a problem for the Spanish conquistadors who used horses to travel long distances.|$|E

25|$|The insect vectors are {{species of}} sandfly {{of the genus}} Phlebotomus in the Old World, and of Lutzomyia in the New World. Sandflies are tiny flies, {{measuring}} 3–6mm long by 1.5–3mm in diameter, and are found in tropical or temperate regions throughout the world. The larvae grow in warm, moist organic matter (such as old trees, house walls, or waste) making <b>them</b> <b>hard</b> to eradicate.|$|E

25|$|There {{are some}} {{assumptions}} {{that underlie the}} SETI programs that may cause searchers to miss signals that are present. Extraterrestrials might, for example, transmit signals that {{have a very high}} or low data rate, or employ unconventional (in our terms) frequencies, which would make <b>them</b> <b>hard</b> to distinguish from background noise. Signals might be sent from non-main sequence star systems that we search with lower priority; current programs assume that most alien life will be orbiting Sun-like stars.|$|E
25|$|A {{large part}} of the {{population}} lived in the surrounding hamlets, some of <b>them</b> <b>hard</b> to reach, thus extending the territory as far as Cetara (which, together with Vietri sul Mare and other smaller hamlets, seceded from Cava in 1806). The people went to Borgo Scacciaventi for commerce and business, while the richest families started building their grand houses (palazzi) in the Borgo, and traders and artisans built their homes above their shops, which served, along with the porticoes in front, to protect their goods.|$|E
25|$|The Gribeauval system {{superseded}} {{a system}} developed in 1732 by Florent-Jean de Vallière. The Vallière system {{reduced the number}} of calibers and made other improvements. However, the system lacked a howitzer and the weight of its cannons made <b>them</b> <b>hard</b> to move. These problems became clear during the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War. Nevertheless, the ranking artillery officer Joseph Florent de Vallière resisted any changes to his father's system. Sharp opposition by Vallière and other reactionaries held up full implementation of the Gribeauval system until 1776. The new artillery pieces were manufactured so that both the barrels and the carriages were lighter, so they were about half the weight of the Vallière guns. A screw to elevate the barrel, a calibrated rear gunsight and interchangeable parts for gun carriages were some other improvements.|$|E

25|$|The Hispanic cavalry {{was a light}} cavalry {{armed with}} a Falcata and several light javelins. The Cantabri tribes invented a {{military}} tactic to maximize {{the advantages of the}} combination between horse and javelin. In this tactic the horsemen rode around in circles, toward and away from the enemy, continually hurling javelins. The tactic was usually employed against heavy infantry. The constant movement of the horsemen gave them an advantage against slow infantry and made <b>them</b> <b>hard</b> to target. The maneuver was designed to harass and taunt the enemy forces, disrupting close formations. This was commonly used against enemy infantry, especially the heavily armed and slow moving legions of the Romans. This tactic {{came to be known as}} the Cantabrian circle. In the late Republic various auxiliary cavalry completely replaced the Italian cavalry contingents and the Hispanic auxiliary cavalry was considered the best.|$|E
25|$|Central and {{peripheral}} are {{terms that}} {{are closely related to}} concepts such as proximal and distal, but they are so widely applicable that in many respects their flexibility makes <b>them</b> <b>hard</b> to define. Loosely speaking, they distinguish near and far, inside and out, or even organs of vital importance such as heart and lungs, from peripheral organs such as fingers, that undoubtedly may be important, but which it may not be life-threatening to dispense with. Examples of the application of the terms are the distinction between central- and peripheral nervous systems, and between peripheral blood vessels and the central circulatory organs, such as the heart and major vessels. The terms also can apply to large and complex molecules such as proteins, where central amino acid residues are protected from antibodies or the like, but peripheral residues are important in docking and other interactions. Other examples include Central and peripheral circadian clocks, and central versus peripheral vision.|$|E
25|$|Edison's major {{innovation}} was {{the establishment}} of an industrial research lab. It was built in Menlo Park, a part of Raritan Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey (today named Edison in his honor), with the funds from the sale of Edison's quadruplex telegraph. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western Union to make a bid. He was surprised to hear them offer $10,000 ($ in today's dollars.), which he gratefully accepted. The quadruplex telegraph was Edison's first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove <b>them</b> <b>hard</b> to produce results.|$|E

500|$|Mills {{sets his}} teams {{out to play}} a passing game, and affirmed this when stating: [...] "My {{philosophy}} is to play football with {{the ball on the}} deck, to play attacking football, to be disciplined with and without the ball". He prefers to employ a 4–3–3 formation, explaining it allows his teams to play entertaining football and makes <b>them</b> <b>hard</b> to beat, and it brought him success when at Tamworth and York. He has stuck with this formation despite charges from some of being tactically stubborn, saying: [...] "I'm not going to change the way my teams play, the systems. I've not even had a thought about that".|$|E
500|$|One of Kaczynski's tactics {{was leaving}} false clues in every bomb. He would {{deliberately}} make <b>them</b> <b>hard</b> to find to mislead investigators into thinking {{they had a}} clue. The first clue was a metal plate stamped with the initials [...] "FC" [...] hidden somewhere (usually in the pipe end cap) in every bomb. One false clue he left was a note in a bomb that did not detonate which reads [...] "Wu—It works! I told you it would—RV". Another clue was the Eugene O'Neill $1 stamps used to send his boxes. One of his bombs was sent embedded in a copy of Sloan Wilson's novel Ice Brothers.|$|E

500|$|The Charity Shield was {{presented}} to Bruce by former Arsenal manager Billy Wright. Wright died barely a year later, aged 70. Graham assumed both clubs would share the trophy, so {{when it came to}} a penalty shoot-out he entrusted his players to decide their order. He described Wright's goal as [...] "brilliant" [...] and felt it was [...] "unfortunate" [...] that Seaman missed: [...] "For a goalkeeper, he normally takes great penalties. He normally hits <b>them</b> <b>hard</b> but he decided to try and place this one and it didn't work." [...] Wright was unashamed of his penalty miss, [...] "…just as long as I don't do it when it is important".|$|E
500|$|Clastosomes {{are small}} nuclear bodies (0.2-0.5 µm) {{described}} as donut-shaped {{due to the}} peripheral capsule around these bodies. This name {{is derived from the}} Greek klastos, broken and soma, body. Clastosomes are not typically present in normal cells, making <b>them</b> <b>hard</b> to detect. They form under high proteolysis conditions within the nucleus and degrade once there is a decrease in activity or if cells are treated with proteasome inhibitors. The scarcity of clastosomes in cells indicates that they are not required for proteasome function. Osmotic stress has also been shown to cause the formation of clastosomes.  These nuclear bodies contain catalytic and regulatory sub-units of the proteasome and its substrates, indicating that clastosomes are sites for degrading proteins.|$|E
500|$|Injury to {{the ears}} has been present since Roman {{times as a}} method of {{reprimand}} or punishment - [...] "In Roman times, when a dispute arose that could not be settled amicably, the injured party cited the name of the person thought to be responsible before the Praetor; if the offender did not appear within the specified time limit, the complainant summoned witnesses to make statements. [...] If they refused, as often happened, the injured party was allowed to drag them by the ear and to pinch <b>them</b> <b>hard</b> if they resisted. [...] Hence the French expression [...] "se faire tirer l’oreille", of which the literal meaning is [...] "to have one's ear pulled" [...] and the figurative meaning [...] "to take a lot of persuading". We use the expression [...] "to tweak [...] (or pull) someone's ears" [...] to mean [...] "inflict a punishment"." ...|$|E
