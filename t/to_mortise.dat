50|$|The Nuki joint is a Japanese {{style of}} {{carpentry}} connection. Nuki joints {{are common in}} Japanese and oriental carpentry, and comprise one of the simplest structural connectors. They are similar <b>to</b> <b>mortise</b> and tenon joints, and have been used traditionally in historic buildings, such as Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples, and also in modern domestic houses. The basic principle involves penetrating one element through another (i.e., embedment); in Japan and other Asian countries this method is used to connect wooden posts and beams.|$|E
50|$|For cutting larger mortises such {{as those}} used in timber frame construction, chain mortisers are {{commonly}} used. A chain with cutters (similar to a chainsaw chain) rotating within a frame clamped to the work is successively plunged into the workpiece <b>to</b> <b>mortise</b> out the required volume. The Makita 7104L is such a tool. These chains are made in varying widths, with numbers of chains in parallel. The teeth are often solid or tipped tungsten carbide. They are thus very expensive, sometimes {{as much as the}} rest of the mortiser.|$|E
40|$|Mineral {{exploration}} and mine development are risky undertakings afflicted with manifold sources of uncertainty. At {{the outset of}} prospecting work, knowledge of the geology in the area under scrutiny is partial, the size of any ore body is unclear, and {{the full extent of}} exploration expenses is uncertain. If a discovery is made, the cost of extraction must be assessed in light of prevailing and likely price/demand trends and a determination must be made concerning the suitability of existing refining technology. Contracts with customers must be arranged <b>to</b> <b>mortise</b> costs, and the international selling that is usually required presents another set of challenges. Subsequent development involves the hazards of sinking shafts, constructing underground works to follow ore bodies that may unexpectedly fault or decline in quality, and often establishing a supporting infrastructure. Reducing uncertainty arising from these sources requires different types of information, knowledge, and expertise. During initial exploration, knowledge of geological formations is needed, expertise in designing drilling programs is vital, and sampling and analytical skills are required. If a promising find is made, knowledge of mining techniques, refining processes, and world markets become all-important. At the same time, {{exploration and}} development are costly, and expenditure may produce no revenue whatever if a discovery fails to materialise. When a viable mineral body is found, development costs can be estimated with some accuracy, but unexpected geological or market conditions can throw projections into disarray. In short, mining is expensive, risky, and knowledge intensive. As a result, mining companies often band together to share risks, costs, and complimentary sets of knowledge in order to mitigate uncertainty...|$|E

50|$|The {{cylindrical}} lock {{was invented}} by Walter Schlage in 1923. The bored cylindrical lock arose from {{a need for a}} more cost-effective method of locking doors. The previous norm, the mortise lock, is a more complex device, and its higher manufacturing cost as well as its more labor-intensive installation make the bored cylindrical lock an ideal substitute, both in price and functionality. Because the mortise lock has a larger lock case, a larger and more complex volume must be removed from the door before it can be installed, but the mortise lock may offer additional functions compared to a cylindrical lock; for instance, the mortise lock may include a deadbolt in a single unit, while the cylindrical lock would require separate face bores for a deadbolt and doorknob. The 1923 patent evolved from an earlier Schlage patent filed in 1920 for a lock whose installation required a face bore and surface rabbet, which simplified door preparation compared <b>to</b> a <b>mortise</b> lock.|$|R

The best option for surgical management of distal tibial fracture is still unclear, whether nail or plate. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study consists of 24 patients of distal tibial fracture treated either with reamed intramedullary nails or locked plating/MIPPO with open reduction method or minimally-invasive techniques. RESULTS 24 patients included {{in the present study were}} divided into two groups as nailing group A and plating group B. Nailing group included 12 patients and plating group included 12. Age range of patients was 21 - 62 years. Most common mode of trauma in both groups as RTA followed by accidental fall in 2 cases. The average time for union and weightbearing was 19 weeks in group A and 20. 08 weeks in group B. Complications like malalignment, more surgical time were seen in group A and surgical site infection, skin necrosis, prolonged immobilisation were seen in group B.

40|$|Background: Lateral ankle sprain (LAS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{injuries}} in sports. Despite extensive research, intrinsic factors that predict initial and recurrent noncontact LAS remain undefined. Purpose: To identify the predictive factors of initial and recurrent noncontact LAS, focusing on ankle flexibility and/or alignment in collegiate athletes. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 191 athletes were assessed during the preseason for factors predictive of noncontact LAS. The baseline measurements included weightbearing dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM), leg-heel angle, foot internal rotation angle in plantar flexion, classification according <b>to</b> the <b>mortise</b> test, and navicular–medial malleolus (NMM) distance. Occurrence of noncontact LAS and participation in practice and games were prospectively recorded for 11 months. Results:Of the 191 athletes assessed, 169 (145 males, 24 females) completed the study; 125 athletes had a history of ankle sprain. During the observational period, 16 athletes suffered noncontact LAS (0. 58 per 1000 athlete-exposures) consisting of 4 initial sprains and 12 recurrences. The hazard ratio estimated by a Cox regression analysis showed that athletes with an NMM distance 4. 65 cm were 4. 14 times more likely to suffer an initial noncontact LAS than were athletes with a shorter NMM distance (95 % confidence interval, 1. 12 - 14. 30) and that athletes with a weightbearing dorsiflexion ROM> 49. 5 were 1. 12 times as likely to suffer a recurrent noncontact LAS compared with athletes with a lower ROM (95 % confidence interval, 1. 05 - 1. 20).

30|$|Chemical changes {{occurred}} in the wood components including the depolymerization and pyrolysis of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin during welding. According to the research of Karl-Christian, acid-catalyzed cleavage of carbohydrates {{and the formation of}} formaldehyde, furfural, and other aldehydes occurred with the elevated temperature. In addition, lignin was cleaved and began auto-condensation [24]. With the changes in the wood components, the free phenolic hydroxyl groups increased and formed the hydrogen bonds with the cellulose to strengthen the stability of the interface [25, 26], and the hydroxyl benzene propane unit decreased [27]. Water vapor and carbon dioxide were the primary components of the volatile gas in the welding process [28 – 30]. The wood dowel welding joints showed improved pullout resistance [31, 32]. The pullout resistance property of the wood dowel welding joints is equivalent to that of wood dowel joints with adhesives, and better than that of nailed joints [33].

40|$|Abstract. An urgent {{is needed}} on the {{preservation}} of Chinese architectural heritages, since environmental and time impacts have been abating their structural resistance capability. It is of great importance in protecting and rehabilitating the ancient architectural culture of China to study the structural characteristics of ancient Chinese timber architectures. As a typical example of ancient timber architectures-Yingxian Wooden Pagoda in west of Shanxi Prince, the dynamic characteristics and damage mechanics of the tower are investigated experimentally and numerically by micro tremor measurements and means of finite-element-method (FEM). The micro tremor measurements are conducted on the tower (each floor) and the surrounding ground. From the micro tremor observation data, the predominant frequency of the surface ground and natural frequency, vibration mode and the damage distribution characteristics of the tower were evaluated. Based on the experimental studies, the tower is created by a delicate finite element model. And in order <b>to</b> simulate the <b>mortise</b> and tenon joint [...] -bucket arches in the structure, which {{is a combination of}} a series of timber structures, a special beam-element group is developed. Numerical simulation of the seismic response of the tower shows that the second and third floors of the tower would be damaged more seriously than other floors for their severe stresses when acted by seismic loading. The present analysis of the tower shows the same phenomena. The results provide basis for repairing and reinforcing the ancient timber tower...|$|R
30|$|The Lauge-Hansen {{classification}} has {{the additional}} advantage of taking ligamentous injuries into account. The comprehensiveness {{of the system}} does {{make it more difficult}} to use than the Weber classification [64, 69, 131]. Thorough knowledge of ankle anatomy and subgroups of the Lauge-Hansen system are required for its application but, although precision can be improved by teaching, some studies have shown that the system cannot be applied consistently with only poor to fair inter-observer reliability [2, 85, 87, 92, 110, 130]. The problem of inconsistent application of the Lauge-Hansen scheme is compounded by fractures patterns that escape this classification system [19, 40]. Some fractures considered stable by the Lauge-Hansen classification may require careful examination to rule out deep deltoid injury [19]. Therefore, the diagnostic value of the Lauge-Hansen classification for ligamentous injuries in SE fractures seems limited. Although the Lauge-Hansen system is not infallible, 91.6  % of the fractures in the study of Schuberth et al. [117] that were classifiable according to the scheme demonstrated the expected deltoid ligament findings. The problem in SE fractures is the ‘invisible medial injury’ [121]. The decision to treat a seemingly stable SE stage two fracture conservatively, without accurate assessment of deltoid ligament injury, may predispose a patient to early posttraumatic osteoarthritis [5, 68, 101, 117, 132]. Rupture of the deep deltoid ligament combined with a displaced lateral malleolar fracture is the biomechanical equivalent of a bimalleolar fracture and is best treated with open reduction and internal fixation of the fibula <b>to</b> restore ankle <b>mortise</b> anatomy [21, 108, 117].|$|R
40|$|Background: While various {{radiographic}} {{parameters and}} application of manual/gravity stress have been proposed to elucidate instability for Weber B fibula fractures, the prognostic capability of these modalities remains unclear. Determination of anatomic positioning of the mortise is paramount. We propose a novel view, the Gravity Reduction View (GRV), which helps elucidate non-anatomic positioning and reducibility of the mortise. Methods: The patient is positioned lateral decubitus with the injured leg elevated on a holder with the fibula directed superiorly. The x-ray cassette is placed posterior to the heel, with the beam angled at 15 ˚ of internal rotation <b>to</b> obtain a <b>mortise</b> view. Our proposed treatment algorithm {{is based upon the}} measurement of the medial clear space (MCS) on the GRV versus the static mortise view (and in comparison to the superior clear space (SCS)) and is based on reducibility of the MCS. A retrospective review of patients evaluated utilizing the GRV was performed. Results: 26 patients with Weber B fibula fractures were managed according to this treatment algorithm. Mean age was 50. 57 years old (range: range: 18 - 81, SD= 19). 17 patients underwent operative treatment and 9 patients were initially treated nonoperatively. 2 patients demonstrated late displacement and were treated surgically. Using this algorithm, at a mean follow-up of 26 weeks, all patients had a final MCS that was less than the SCS (final mean MCS 2. 86 mm vs. mean SCS of 3. 32) indicating effectiveness of the treatment algorithm. Conclusion: The GRV is a novel radiographic view in which deltoid competency, reducibility and initial positioning of the mortise are assessed by comparing a static mortise view with the appearance of the mortise on the GRV. We have developed a treatment algorithm based on the GRV and have found it to be useful in guiding treatment and successful at achieving anatomic mortise alignment...|$|R
40|$|Ankle {{injuries}} {{are the most}} common injury in physically active individuals. 10 - 12 These injuries often occur in sports requiring frequent cutting and jumping such as basket-ball, volleyball, and football. 9, 12 These activities create an environment that may predispose the ankle to forced inversion and plantar flexion, the common mechanism of injury for most ankle sprains. 11 Increased incidence of ankle sprains and subsequent lin-gering disability has led to the realization that prophylac-tic ankle supports are an important component of injury prevention. Prophylactic measures such as taping and brac-ing are thought to decrease the incidence of ankle sprains. 13, 28 Specifically, incidence of ankle sprains per 1000 exposures decreased from 32. 8 to 14. 7 when prophylactic ankle taping was employed. 13 It has been hypothesized that ankle taping is effective in reducing ankle injuries because of the increased structural support provided <b>to</b> the ankle <b>mortise</b> by the tape. 1, 6 Numerous studies have investigated the effects of taping on range of motion restriction. 7, 15, 21, 23 - 25 It has been well documented that immediately after tape application, ankle range of motion is restricted in all planes of movement associated with ankle injuries. 14, 23, 25, 27, 30 Specifically, inversion and eversion range of motion is reduced immediately after tape application by 37 % and 32 %, respectively. 7 Not only is the amount of inversion movement reduced, but the rate of movement also decreases immediately after tape application. 1 Although white cloth tape is frequently used in clinical practice, investigators have identified that white tape loosens with activity and therefore may not provide opti-mal protection to the joints. 14, 15, 20, 21, 24 Some studies have found that tape loses its restrictive properties after jus...|$|R
40|$|Autor u radu donosi prikaz dviju vladarskih crkava iz IX. st. slična ustroja s westwerkom. Uz obje crkve pronađeni su ulomci kamene plastike s dedikacijskim natpisom, od kojih jedan spominje župana a drugi kraljicu. Na Klisu je pronađena ploča s reljefom na temu Majestas Domini. Obje crkve spadaju u privatne crkve, tzv. eigenkirche, što upućuje na novi način franačke organizacije teritorija s utvrđivanjem feudalnog posjeda (Ordensburgen). The {{remains of}} churches {{that have been}} found and are {{discussed}} in the text can reliably be ascribed to the chapel of the long-sought Trpimir residence at Klis and the pre-Romanesque stratum of the church dedicated to the BVM at the cemetery of the village of Blizna Gornja in the Trogir hinterland. The find of sculpture and texts written on the altar screens show that in both cases these were churches of members of the medieval ruling elite: the church in Blizna Gornja can be connected with the župan of the županija of Drid, and the chapel in Klis directly with the ruler of Croatia. The existence of a medieval church at Klis is strongly supported by investigations of the walls, which showed {{that a large number of}} marble fragments of ecclesiastical stone architectural decoration from the 9 th to the 12 th century were incorporated into the building of the mosque. Among the fragments there are pilasters, plutei and the trabeation of an altar screen from the early Middle Ages, while the whole of the medieval material is built into the walls of the mosque above its floor level. In the western wall four marble fragments of architraves of an altar screen with parts of an inscription were found, one fragment of a marble architrave of a pluteus and a pilaster with the base of a pillar of the screen. All the fragments of this carving were made of Proconesian marble and were incorporated in such a way that the decorations and inscriptions were not to be seen. The fragments belonged to the septum and contain typical pre-Romanesque interlacing motifs, pretzels, and the parts of an inscription are carved on a ribbon of the trabeation of the altar screen below the characteristic hook decoration. Fragments of the trabeation contain parts of an inscription about a ruler that mentions the royal family, and on an architrave of the altar screen of the church in Klis that has been found, for the first time the title of queen is mentioned. The parts of the altar screen found with interlacing ornamentation of the 9 th century belong to a pilaster with interlacing and an architrave of the pluteus with interlacing ornamentation and four fragments of the architrave of the altar screen with parts of a royal inscription. The fragments contain wording with the royal formula: ORUM FILIU(S) [...] ., MEA DOM(N) A S(C) LAVA REGINA [...] . Although these are detached pieces, it is very clear that they are part of a single inscription in which the wife of the ruler or king is mentioned. It is clear in this part of the text that the wife of the ruler is called regina, from which it can be concluded that her husband, the subject of the inscription, is a ruler who bears the title of rex. It is important to point out also that she is addressed as domna, and that analogously to this her husband must have been addressed as dominus. From these titles, the votive inscription of the church in Klis might have belonged to a ruler of the middle of the 9 th century, probably to Trpimir himself, the only ruler of that time who is mentioned together with the title of king, probably attained through victory in the war with the nation of the Greeks, as reported by the Saxon Gottschalk. And the fragment of the first part of the inscription contained this very title of the ruler (REX SCLAV) ORUM FILIU(S). This would be supported by the inscription in the Cividale Gospel, where Trpimir is signed as »domno Trepimiro«, and the title of his wife really could have been DOMNA SCLAVA REGINA, as this is read from the wording on the architrave of the altar screen. As well as the described parts of the septum, during works on the renovation of the Church of St Vitus a slab with a relief was found built flat as a building stone in the annular wall of the tambour. This fragment of early medieval figural sculpture of Proconesian marble shows Christ in Glory. Preserved from the composition featuring the topic Majestas Domini in the Klis relief is the central figure of Christ in a mandorla and an angel on his right hand side. Christ is shown down to the waist, his right hand raised in blessing, while in the left hand he holds a scroll with the Gospels. The relief from the Klis Church of St Vitus, though modest in its dimensions, might have belonged to the lintel of a portal of an early medieval church, although according <b>to</b> the <b>mortise</b> on the upper part it could equally well be supposed to have been a fragment of some stone furnishing that consisted of pillars and beams. The visual treatment of the relief of the linearly grooved surfaces that suggest folds of clothing, the manner of treatment of the figures with single incision of the features with expressive underlined eyes, the hatched curls of the hair and the particularly characteristic handling of the nose reveal the hand of the skilled mason who made the relief. As for the origin of the relief of the church in Klis, the finding of the medieval royal church in the foundations of the Church of St Vitus and the confirmation of the existence of a fortified royal court at the site of Klis Fort are sufficient warrant that it originally came from Klis. From this it could well be hypothesised that the relief of Christ from the church in Klis belongs to a separate sculptural unit, directly related to this site. Extensive archaeological and conservation-restoration excavations in 1999 - 2000 preceded the thoroughgoing renovation of the Church of St Mary in Blizna Gornja. Against expectations, the pre-Romanesque architecture of a ruler from the 9 th century was found in them, belonging through their form among the few specimens of pre-Romanesque churches with external buttresses of semicircular cross-section. Like similar examples, the Church of St Saviour at the source of the Cetina and the church at Lopuška glava, Biskupija, by Knin, the Church of St Mary in Blizna had a forecourt in front of the main elevation. An external staircase led to the first floor, over which there was probably a tower, as in examples of similar churches with a westwork. In the forecourt of the church the lid of a Roman period sarcophagus used as a gravestone was found. The find of the sarcophagus lid and many fragments of stone sculptural decoration of the 9 th century in marble and limestone show that the Church of St Mary was richly endowed and equipped. One of the fragments contains the name and title of the donor: [...] . ANVSIV[panv]S, for which reason it is assumed to have belonged to an altar screen put up by a Croatian magnate, mostly likely a župan. Numerous fragments of trabeation have been found, the beams of which were marble, while the arched tegurium was made of limestone. Fragments of marble plutei and pilasters of the altar screen, as well as pillars with capitals found around the church belong in their form to the sculptural art of the 9 th century. Fragments found are enough for the reconstruction of the original appearance of the screen and for an understanding of the inscriptions in the field of the lower part of the gable and the architraves. The inscription is a typical intercession, in which the prayer is addressed to Our Lady and to St John the Baptist, asking for their intercession with Christ, for the salvation of his soul, and the following reading can be proposed: [...] . [pe]R I[nte]RCOESSIONEM BEATE ET GLORIO[se matri]S D[e]I GE[netricis apud Christum satvatOREm SCTAe Mariae] ET BEATI IO[hannis Baptistae] OP[vs] E[dificavit] pro animae suae[reme]DIO V[otum complevit Prod]ANVS IV[ppanu]S. According to the inscription on the septum the church would have been dedicated to St Mary like many of the churches of that time in the early of medieval Croatia, in Golubić, Ostrovica, Biskupija, Gradec, Pađeni and Lepuri. But the inscription relates it in a particular way via the intercession of Mary and John to Christ, to whom the intercession is addressed. The permeation of the contents by the theme of the Madonna’s intercession (i. e. the Deisis), typically Byzantine iconography on the one hand and the Sanctus written in the spirit of the revived Roman liturgy on the screens of churches in Trogir as well as the churches of the Croatian župans in the hinterland and on the islands suggest something of their specific political position in the second half of the 9 th century at the border between the tradition of the East and the new influences coming from the West. The question arises as to who the donor of the church of St Mary in Blizna Gornja was. Only the ending of the name and the beginning of the title in the letters IV[ppanu]S are in existence. From this it can be assumed that the church was put up by a župan, and his name, which ends with the letters [...] . ANUS, might be Stephanus or, more likely, it was part of some Croatian name that is borne in the documents by the župans, like Branus or Prodanus. According to the results of the most recent research, St Mar in Blizna is a votive church of a Croatian magnate put up in the middle of the 9 th century on the remains of an ancient villa that was part of his estate. Analysis of the architecture confirms this. The oldest archaeological stratum found at the site is the remainder of a wall of the later Roman period, probably from the 6 th century, in front of the forecourt of the church. This stratum is insufficiently investigated, but it belonged to a building of much greater size than the pre-Romanesque Church of St Mary. The early medieval stratum, of the 9 th century, lays claim to the foundations of the church, of a simple rectangular ground plan with semicircular buttresses, and the shallowly founded apse on the bedrock might be a building of later time. A very good state of preservation is exhibited by the walls of the pre-Romanesque building that bound the ground plan, the beginning of the staircase of the atrium, its western and southern doors, while in the interior of the atrium, in front of the façade of the church, a cylindrical sarcophagus lid has been found. The two-storey court, the chapel of the pre-Romanesque church and its undoubtedly funerary purpose in the ground floor part are known in the literature as westwork, and their finding at the site of Blizna Gornja suggests there was a very strong influence from the Carolingian court on the Croatian ruling and aristocratic stratum of the 9 th century, to which, along with the actual rulers, it was primarily the župans that belonged. The Church of St Mary on the current graveyard of the village of Blizna Gornja was, then, the church of a magnate, who in his name has the ending anus, most probably Prodan (Prodanus?) or Bran (Branus?) rather than Stjepan (Stephanus), a župan of the županija of Drid of the middle of the 9 th century, for at that time along with the titular functions of the Croatian župans their Slavic names were regularly given. This is a typical example of a private church (Eigenkirche), a new legal institution of the Frankish type, put up on the foundations of a renovated Roman period villa, the feudal property of the lord, who used it for ceremonial purposes, as well as a private funeral chapel for him and the members of his immediate family, and hence it was forbidden to bury members of the community at large in its vicinity. Among the process that took hold of Europe in the post-Carolingian period an important place is occupied by the construction of fortified manors, which from the 9 th to the 12 th century totally changed the image of early medieval Europe. The Croatian ruler, who was at first directly subject to Aquileia, the Frankish ecclesiastical centre in Friuli, must have been directly impressed by the construction of the fortified estates of the marquisate of Friuli, for it was from here that Frankish missionaries arrived in Croatia. Its connection with Frankish church centre even after the abolition of the marquisate in 828 is shown by the pilgrimages of Croatian dukes and their families to the Benedictine monastery of Cividale during the whole of the 8 th century. Einhard’s Annales mentioned Borna’s forts in Dalmatia, into which the duke retreated before the attack of Ljudevit Posavski. Trpimir’s royal residence is mentioned in a deed of gift of his of 852. There is an obvious difference in the name of the ruler’s residence of Trpimir’s time, as mentioned in two texts: one mentions villa nostra, the other curte nostra. The mentioned curtis in the document is called Clusa, which implies the name of the fortress of Klis, which for the whole of its history was in strategic control of the approach to the sea, to ancient Salona and the city of Split. Unlike Klis, which is called a curtis, the name of the villa from the Gottschalk text is not recorded, and it might be to do with some residential complex in the Salona area, or perhaps some place very close to Klis, such as Rižnice, in which Trpimir, wishing to make contrition for his sins, built a monastery and church after the war, at the time of the normalisation of relations with the Romans. The fact is that the concepts of villa and curtis appear at the same time in the mid- 9 th century in the context of the formation of feuds and manors, although there may be some fundamental difference concealed in them. One and the other may be related to the ruler’s residence. The concept of curtis in this sense can be found afterwards, among many examples of the 11 th century, when the king’s curtis of Rogovi on the lower slopes of the hill by Biograd, or the curtes of the imperial protospatar and ban Stjepan Uitula, Nova sella and Butina ues, as well as many others related to the names of their owners, like that of Vlkomir and Preda in Žrnovnica or Tješen on Brač. Still, in the light of the new research, the curte nostra, quae Clusan dicitur mentioned in Trpimir’s deed of gift should be looked at in a completely different context, not only as an estate but also as the residential complex of a feudal ruler...|$|R
