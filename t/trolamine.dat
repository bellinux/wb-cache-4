50|$|The US Food and Drug Administration has not {{reviewed}} {{any of the}} over-the-counter products {{listed in}} the Daily Med database that contain <b>trolamine</b> salicylate. Also, the producers of <b>trolamine</b> salicylate products have not provided evidence to the FDA in support of claims that this chemical is directly absorbed through the skin into underlying tissue. However, one study reported that <b>trolamine</b> salicylate does penetrate into, and persist within, underlying muscle tissue. The test subjects used either the <b>trolamine</b> salicylate product or a placebo while engaging in an exercise regimen designed to induce muscle soreness. The experimenters observed that those using the <b>trolamine</b> salicylate product exercised longer before reporting the onset of soreness, reported less intense soreness, and reported that their soreness did not {{last as long as}} the people who used the placebo.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the effect of skin pre-treatment with Transcutol® and eucalyptus oil on systemic absorption of topical <b>trolamine</b> salicylate in rat. Methods: Pharmacokinetic parameters of salicylic acid following administration of <b>trolamine</b> salicylate on rat skin pre-treated with either Transcutol® or eucalyptus oil were determined using both non-compartmental and non-linear mixed effect modeling approaches and compared with those of control group. Results: Median (% of interquartile range/median) of salicylic acid AUC 0 - 8 hr (ng/mL/hr) values in Transcutol® or eucalyptus oil treated rats were 2522 (139 %) and 58976 (141 %), respectively as compared to the 3023 (327 %) of the control group. Skin pre-treatment with eucalyptus oil could significantly decrease extravascular volume of distribution (V/F) and elimination rate constant (k) of salicylic acid. Conclusion: Unlike Transcutol®, eucalyptus oil lead to enhanced transdermal absorption of <b>trolamine</b> salicylate through rat skin...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{explore the}} role and {{mechanism}} of a radiation protection cream (Rp) {{in the treatment of}} radiation dermatitis, and to accumulate necessary technical information for a new drug report on Rp. MethodsHigh-performance liquid chromatography was used to establish the method of measuring the main effective ingredients of sovereign and adjuvant herbs of Rp drugs, and to formulate the draft quality standards of Rp. A total of 48 Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided into the Model, <b>Trolamine</b> cream (Tc), Rp and Blank groups according to a random number table method. The skin of each rat's buttocks was irradiated using an electron linear accelerator to establish an acute radiation dermatitis model. The histological changes were observed under light microscopy and electron microscopy during wound healing and the effect of Rp on rat fibroblast Ku 70 / 80 gene expression was detected at the transcriptional level. ResultsPathological examination revealed that Rp protected the cellular and subcellular structures of skin after irradiation, promoting the proliferation and restoration of collagen fibers. Ku 70 / 80 mRNA expression levels in the Rp and Tc groups were higher than that in the model group (P< 0. 05). Moreover, The majority of grade radiation dermatitis relative to the Model, Rp and Tc groups for reducing grade III and IV dermatitis efficiency were 85. 7 % and 69. 2 % (P< 0. 05), respectively. The efficacy of Rp group in treating radiation dermatitis was better than the <b>Trolamine</b> cream group by 16. 5 % (P< 0. 05). ConclusionCompared with Tc, Rp had certain advantages in the efficacy and performance to price ratio. Thus, Rp is considered an effective alternative formulation for the prevention and treatment of radiation dermatitis...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{evaluate}} the effects of pharmacological and non-pharmacological topical controls in the prevention of radiation dermatitis. Methods - Relevant clinical trials were identified through electronic searching databases CINAHL, CENTRAL, LILACS, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Handsearching and gray literature searches were also performed to find additional references. Primary outcomes of interest were the development of radiation dermatitis and the time of occurrence of radiation dermatitis. Results - Thirteen randomized clinical trials were included in this review. The trials were published in Chinese, English, or French, from 1980 to 2015. Pharmacological interventions used in the trials were <b>trolamine,</b> aloe vera, allantoin, Lianbai liquid, sucralfate, Na-sucrose octasulfate, olive oil, hialuronic acid, and dexpanthenol. Non-pharmacological topical controls were usual care/institution routine, aqueous cream, mild soap, water thermal gel, placebo, and no intervention.

Tyrimo uždaviniai: nustatyti kremo emulsijos tipą ir pH reikšmę; įvertinti kremo, pagaminto ekstemporaliu ir pramoniniu būdu, emulsinių lašelių dydį ir kinematinę klampą; įvertinti maišymo greičio ir laiko įtaką kremo klampai ir emulsinių lašelių dydžiui; ištirti ir įvertinti kremų stabilumą; ištirti pH reikšmės įtaką kremo reologinėms savybėms. Remiantis spalvinio tyrimo ir laidumo elektros srovei rezultatais, buvo nustatyta, kad kremas priklauso hidrokremų grupei, a/v tipo emulsijoms, kuri susidaro preparato gamybos metu panaudojus du priešingo tipo emulsiklius (tenzidus) – trolamino stearatą (a/v) ir glicerolio monostearatą (v/a). Nustatyta kremo pH reikšmė lygi 8, kas rodo, kad kremas yra bazinis. Nustatyta, kad kremo gamybos būdas įtakoja emulsinių lašelių dydį ir klampą. Ekstemporaliai pagaminto kremo dalelių dydis ir klampa reikšmingai skiriasi nuo pramoniniu būdu pagaminto kremo tiriamųjų rodmenų. Tai patvirtina, kad gamybos būdas įtakoja kremo kokybę. Išmatavus dalelių dydį, nustatyta, kad maišymo laikas įtakoja kremo emulsinių lašelių dydį: esant maišymo greičiui 7000 aps/min, bet skirtingiems maišymo laikams 19 min., 21 min., 25 min. ir 27 min., buvo gauta, kad mažiausias vidutinis dalelės dydis yra maišant 21 minutę. Ištyrus kremo stabilumą diferencinio centrifugavimo metodu, nustatyta, kad maišant preparatą 21 minutę esant maišyklės apsisukimų greičiui 7000 aps/min, jis būna stabiliausias. Įdomu tai, kad mikroskopinio tyrimo metu identifikuotas mažiausias emulsinių lašelių dydis šiuo metodu pagamintame kreme. Tai rodo, kad kremų stabilumą galima vertinti ne tik pagal emulsinių lašelių dydžio matavimą, bet ir diferencinio centrifugavimo testu. Nustatyta, kad pH reikšmė įtakoja kremo stabilumą ir klampą. Pakeitus pH reikšmę nuo 8 iki 5 kremas keičia konsistenciją. Gravimetrinio stabilumo tyrimo rezultatai gauti per 96 valandas parodė, kad mažinant pH reikšmę pieno rūgštimi stabilumas sumažėjo 20 %, o - vandenilio chlorido rūgštimi – 49 %. Tai parodo, kad kremo pH reikšmę mažinti netikslinga. The paper aims to {{investigate}} reologic features {{and stability of}} hydrophilic cream. Hydrophilic cream {{is the object of}} the paper. Goals of the paper are the following: determine the type of cream emulsion and the pH value; evaluate the size of emulsion droplets and kinematic viscosity of cream produced extemporally and industrially; evaluate stirring speed and time influence on cream viscosity and the size of emulsion droplets; investigate and evaluate cream stability; investigate influence of the pH value on reologic features of cream. Cream emulsion type has been defined by the methods of colour test and electric conductivity. Cream produced extemporally and industrially, the influence of mixing speed and time on the size of emulsion droplets were measured by electronic microscope, while kinematic viscosity was estimated by viscosimeter. Cream stability was measured by differential centrifugation method. Influence of the pH value on reologic features of cream and its stability was measured by viscosimeter and gravimetric method. The results of colour test and electric conductivity have revealed that cream belongs to the group of hydro-creams, a/v type emulsions, which results in the process of product production using two opposite types of emulsifiers (tenzides) - <b>trolamine</b> stearate (a/v) and glycerol monostearate (v/a). The pH value of cream was equal to 8, which shows that cream is basal. The research has revealed that cream production method influences the size of emulsion droplets and viscosity. The size and viscosity of cream particles produced extemporally are significantly different from test parameters of cream produced industrially. It confirms that production method affects cream quality. The measurement of the size of particles has shown that stirring time affects the amount of emulsion droplets in cream: the stirring speed of 7000 rpm, but different stirring time, i. e. 19 min., 21 min., 25 min. and 27 min., has shown that the smallest average size of cream particle is 21 minutes while stirring. The analysis of cream stability, which was carried out by differential centrifugation method, has revealed that the product is the most stable after stirring it for 21 minutes within a speed of 7000 rpm. Interestingly, microscopic test has identified the size of the smallest emulsion droplet in cream produced by this method. It shows that cream stability can be evaluated not only by the measurements of the size of emulsion droplets, but also by differential centrifugation test. The research has revealed that the pH value affects cream stability and viscosity. If the pH value is changed from 8 to 5, cream will change its consistence. Gravimetric stability results, which were obtained within 96 hours, showed that due to reduction of the pH value, the stability of lactic acid decreased by 20 % and hydrochloric acid declined 49 %. It shows that reduction of the pH value is not advisable...|$|E
