5|$|Marsh {{and then}} Hatcher {{assumed that the}} animal was aquatic, because of the {{position}} of its nasal openings at the apex of the cranium. Similar aquatic behavior was commonly depicted for other large sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. A 1951 study by Kenneth A.

Since the 1970s, general consensus has the sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals, browsing on trees, ferns, and bushes.|$|E
5|$|Physiologically, the {{function}} of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body. The brain acts on <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.|$|E

5|$|The name {{multiple}} sclerosis {{refers to the}} scars (sclerae – better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system.

5|$|The {{skin of a}} larva is mottled with black, brown, {{and yellow}} pigmentation. Skin color changes as the larvae develop and pigment cells migrate and {{concentrate}} in {{different regions of the}} body. The pigment cells, called chromatophores, are derived from the neural crest. The three types of pigment chromatophores in salamanders include yellow xanthophores, black melanophores, and silvery iridiophores (or guanophores). As the larvae mature, the melanophores concentrate along the body and provide the darker background. The yellow xanthophores arrange along the spine and on top of the limbs. <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> is flecked with reflective iridiophores along the sides and underneath.|$|E

Material from these quarries was described in 2012 by Kirkland along with Andrew McDonald, John Bird, and Peter Dodson, who also provided an updated diagnosis for Eolambia based on this material.|$|E

5|$|Amphibians have a {{juvenile}} stage and an adult stage, and the circulatory {{systems of the}} two are distinct. In the juvenile (or tadpole) stage, the circulation {{is similar to that}} of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop. In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria. When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.|$|E
5|$|Not only do {{they affect}} injured people's self-image, these {{stereotypes}} are particularly harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved in rehabilitation. Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their patients as asexual, particularly if the injury occurred {{at a young age}} and the patient never had sexual experiences. Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts their access to birth control, information about sexuality, and sexual health-related medical care such as annual gynecological exams. Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is that sex is strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers to discount the importance of <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> and of the individual.|$|E
5|$|Primitive {{fish have}} a four-chambered heart, but the {{chambers}} are arranged sequentially {{so that this}} primitive heart is quite unlike the four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds. The first chamber is the sinus venosus, which collects deoxygenated blood, from the body, through the hepatic and cardinal veins. From here, blood flows into the atrium {{and then to the}} powerful muscular ventricle where the main pumping action will take place. The fourth and final chamber is the conus arteriosus which contains several valves and sends blood to the ventral aorta. The ventral aorta delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows, through the dorsal aorta, into <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> (In tetrapods, the ventral aorta has divided in two; one half forms the ascending aorta, while the other forms the pulmonary artery).|$|E

5|$|Some other {{anatomical}} distinction {{exists between}} the larvae of the Nematocera and the Brachycera. Especially in the Brachycera, little demarcation is seen between the thorax and abdomen, though the demarcation may be visible in many Nematocera, such as mosquitoes; in the Brachycera, {{the head of the}} larva is not clearly distinguishable from <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> and few, if any, sclerites are present. Informally, such brachyceran larvae are called maggots, but the term is not technical and often applied indifferently to fly larvae or insect larvae in general. The eyes and antennae of brachyceran larvae are reduced or absent, and the abdomen also lacks appendages such as cerci. This lack of features is an adaptation to food such as carrion, decaying detritus, or host tissues surrounding endoparasites. Nematoceran larvae generally have well-developed eyes and antennae, while those of Brachyceran larvae are reduced or modified.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{specimens}} of Pinacosaurus {{of different ages}} found that during ontogenetic development, the ribs of juvenile ankylosaurs fused with their vertebrae. The forelimbs strongly increased in robustness, while the hindlimbs did not become larger relative {{to the rest of}} the skeleton, further evidence that the arms bore most of the weight. In the cervical halfrings, the underlying bone band developed outgrowths connecting it with the underlying osteoderms, which simultaneously fused to each other.

On <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> the ossification process progressed from the neck onwards in the direction of the tail.
