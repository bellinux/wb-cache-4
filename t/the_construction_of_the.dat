5|$|Like {{the rest}} of Sikkim, not much {{is known about the}} early history of Gangtok. The {{earliest}} records date from <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hermitic Gangtok monastery in 1716.

It became the capital of what was left of Sikkim after an English conquest in the mid-19th century in response to a hostage crisis. After the defeat of the Tibetans by the British, Gangtok became a major stopover in the trade between Tibet and British India {{at the end of the}} 19th century.

5|$|One of the {{arguments}} in favor of the construction of I-68 was that the freeway would improve the poor economic conditions in western Maryland. The economy of the surrounding area has improved since <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freeway, especially in Garrett County, where the freeway opened up the county to tourism from Washington, D.C., and Baltimore. Correspondingly, Garrett County saw a sharp increase in population and employment during and after <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road, with full- and part-time employment increasing from 8,868 in 1976 to 15,334 in 1991. However, economic difficulties remain in Allegany and Garrett counties. There were concerns over loss of customers to businesses that have been cut off from the main highway due to <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new alignment in the 1980s, leading to protests when then-Governor Harry Hughes visited the Sideling Hill road cut when it was opened.|$|E

Within five years, the population doubled to 7,531. New transport links with southern British Columbia and Alberta spurred continued growth into the next decade. The population peaked in 1966 at 12,392, then declined throughout the 1970s, rising again briefly during <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nearby town of Tumbler Ridge in the early 1980s.
