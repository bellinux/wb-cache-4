5|$|After another {{supermarket}} {{strip to}} the east, a long, gentle divided {{bend in the}} road almost a mile long ends with an overpass where NY55 comes in from the west. It joins NY22 as the two routes, returning to two lanes, pass through the eastern fringe of the village of Pawling and then by Trinity-Pawling School. Past the village, the railroad tracks edge closer to the highway as NY22 enters the scenic Harlem Valley, which lends {{its name to the}} railroad line. The road curves more gently and takes longer straightaways, with lower density of residential and commercial development. <b>Two</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> Pawling, the Appalachian Trail crosses the road next to the line's Appalachian Trail station. The flag stop allows hikers access to the nearby Pawling Nature Preserve.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War Wodehouse and his wife {{remained}} at their Le Touquet house, where, during the Phoney War, he worked on Joy in the Morning. With the advance of the Germans, the nearby Royal Air Force base withdrew; Wodehouse was offered the sole spare seat in one of the fighter aircraft, but he turned down the opportunity as it would have meant leaving behind Ethel and their dog. On 21 May 1940, with German troops advancing through northern France, the Wodehouses decided to drive to Portugal and fly from there to the US. <b>Two</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> home their car broke down, so they returned and borrowed a car from a neighbour; with the routes blocked with refugees, they returned home again.|$|E
5|$|However, Washington {{was running}} behind {{schedule}} {{as he had}} planned to attack and capture the British outposts before dawn and capture the garrison shortly afterward. By the time dawn broke he was still <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> the town. Washington sent 350 men under the command of Brigadier General Hugh Mercer to destroy the bridge over Stony Creek in order to delay Cornwallis's army when he found out that Washington had escaped. Shortly before 8:00 AM, Washington wheeled the rest of the army to the right down the unused road. First in the column went General John Sullivan's division consisting of Arthur St. Clair's and Isaac Sherman's brigades. Following them were John Cadwalader's brigade and then Daniel Hitchcock's.|$|E

5|$|However, the Japanese retreated beyond Port Arthur's gunfire support range, and {{had been}} {{reinforced}} by main forces of six battleships. At 0850, Makarov turned around {{to head back to}} the harbor and join with three other battleships that had just left. After the squadron had united and turned back towards the enemy, about <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> the shore, on 9.42 Petropavlosk detonated a Japanese-laid mine on her port side. Petropavlovsk sank, taking 27 officers and 652 men, including Admiral Makarov and war artist Vasily Vereshchagin with her. A monument was constructed in Saint Petersburg in 1913 to honor Stephan Makarov after Japanese divers identified his remains inside the wreck of Petropavlovsk and gave him a burial at sea.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Schweppes {{acquired}} from the Burrows family Pewtress Spring, in Colwall, {{on the western}} side of the Herefordshire Beacon, approximately <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> Colwall village. The source here emerges at the fault line between the Silurian thrust and the Precambrian diorite and granite above it. The spring was renamed Primeswell Spring, and in 1929 Schweppes commenced bottling. The factory employed 25 people who filled 26 million bottles annually. It was operated by Coca-Cola Enterprises Ltd., and the water was sold under the Schweppes brand name. On 20 October 2010 Coca-Cola Enterprises, who owned the Malvern brand, announced that production would be ceasing as of 3 November 2010. This decision, which was widely criticised both in the town and beyond, was due to the declining market share Malvern has on the overall water market. On 28 October 2011, it was reported that the bottling plant is being sold to a property company.|$|E
5|$|Mow Cop Castle is an elaborate, Gothic Revival folly, built <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> Rode Hall, at Mow Cop, land {{previously}} {{belonging to}} the estate. Dating from 1754, the castle was built by Randle Wilbraham III and designed by the Hiorne brothers, the architects {{who worked on the}} 1752 improvements to the hall. It was constructed to improve the view across the valley from the hall. The family often used it as a summer house and for picnics. The castle fell into disrepair a number of times in the 19th century and several programmes of restoration were completed, including the replacement of the doors at a cost of Â£4 4s. The castle and surrounding land were sold by the Wilbrahams in 1923. The castle is renowned as the birthplace of Primitive Methodism, following a camp meeting there in 1807.|$|E

5|$|On April 22, 1992, {{less than}} a year after her kidnapping, a man called the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department from a gas station less than <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> the Garridos' home. The caller {{reported}} that he saw Dugard in the gas station staring intently at a missing child poster of herself. The caller then reported seeing her leave in a large yellow van, possibly a Dodge. In 2009, after Dugard's release, an old yellow Dodge van was recovered from the Garrido property that matched the description of the van given in the call. The license plate was not reported in the 1992 call; the caller, the girl, and the van were gone by the time police arrived. The caller never identified himself, and the police did not pursue the matter any further. In contradiction to this story, Dugard reported that she never left the Garrido property from the day she was kidnapped until shortly before her first child was born in August 1994.|$|E
5|$|The advance {{continued}} {{in this fashion}} until the village of El Kab was reached on August 4, where a shot fired at the column alerted Major-General Hunter that his presence was known to the Mahdists. Fully aware that reinforcements would be {{on their way to}} Abu Hamed, Major-General Hunter further increased his column's pace, despite the deaths of three soldiers of the 3rd Egyptian Battalion and the loss of fifty-eight stragglers at various points along the route. Hunter's forces were supplemented at Kuli by 150 Ababdeh friendlies on August 5. The night of August 6, the column marched another sixteen miles over exceptionally arduous terrain to Ginnifab, only <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> Abu Hamed. Here half the 3rd Egyptian Battalion detached from the column to escort the supply train as it arrived and guard the reserve ammunition. After a two-hour rest from three-thirty to five-thirty, Major-General Hunter ordered his men to attention and began the final assault.|$|E
5|$|At 00:30 on 11 February the {{explosives}} were detonated {{and the western}} pier destroyed, causing the aqueduct to crumble and effectively break in half, and the Ginestra bridge was also successfully destroyed. Leaving one man who had broken his ankle when he had landed with a nearby farmer, {{the remainder of the}} Troop withdrew from the area at 01:00, splitting into three groups and heading towards the coast. The three groups moved as fast as possible towards the coast, but were all captured within a few hours of the aqueduct being demolished. The group commanded by Major Pritchard was spotted by a farmer who raised the alarm at a nearby village, leading to a local carabinieri unit surrounding the group; with little ammunition and heavily outnumbered, Pritchard decided to surrender. The other three groups, including the six sappers who had landed <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> the objective, fared little better. The two groups from the aqueduct were soon located by Italian soldiers and ambushed, forcing them to surrender after brief firefights. The third group were found by a group of civilians as they moved towards the coast; after attempting to bluff their way past by claiming to be German soldiers on a special field exercise, which failed when the local Mayor demanded identity papers, they were captured by carabinieri. All were stripped of their weapons and equipment and transported to Naples, {{with the exception of the}} Italian translator, Picchi; he was handed over to the Blackshirts, a Fascist paramilitary group, who tortured and then executed him. Even if any of the groups had managed to make their way to the coast and the rendezvous point, they would not have been picked up by HMS Triumph. One of the two Whitleys conducting the diversionary raid at Foggia suffered engine trouble after bombing the railway yards. The pilot radioed Malta, informing his airfield that he was ditching in the mouth of the River Sele, coincidentally the area where the rendezvous was to occur. Fearing that the message had been monitored by the Italians and that the submarine might sail into a trap, the decision was made by senior officers not to send it to the rendezvous point.|$|E
