In 1999, the university signed the Talloires Declaration, which committed Dalhousie and other higher education institutions <b>to</b> <b>developing,</b> creating, supporting, and maintaining sustainability.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{medicine}} {{has been a}} recognized medical specialty in the United States and other developed countries for nearly forty years, although these countries' EMSs did not become fully mature until the early 1990s. At that point, some of its practitioners turned their attention from developing the specialty at home <b>to</b> <b>developing</b> it abroad, leading {{to the birth of}} international emergency medicine. They began to support the growth of emergency medicine worldwide, doing so through conferences, national and regional emergency medicine organizations, relief and development organizations, international emergency medicine fellowships, physician exchanges, information transfer, and curriculum development.|$|E
5|$|Grand Forks {{received}} $171 {{million from}} the federal program, Community Development Block Grants, which was used for 198 projects within the city.

50|$|In February 2001 DARPA awarded $5.5 {{million to}} eight teams <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> {{unmanned}} ground combat vehicles (UGCV).

Five other teams were <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> UGCVs payloads.|$|R
50|$|Mitsusaki-kengyo, junior {{fellow of}} Kikuoka-kengyo, was active then. He {{was also a}} pupil of Yaezaki-kengyo. He focused on the koto because it had {{possibility}} <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> more than Jiuta, which had developed very enough and seemed {{there had been a}} little room <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> further. He composed some pieces featuring koto solo, and this became a trigger <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> Soukyoku independently. Yoshizawa-kengyo took over and promoted this movement, then began <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> gradually.|$|R
50|$|He {{collaborated with}} Leslie Lawrence Foldy <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation, and with George B. Field <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> the Wouthuysen-Field coupling.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>developing</b> {{a suitable}} barrier, the SAM Laboratories {{also had to}} assist in the design of a gaseous separation plant, which became known as K-25. Libby helped with the engineers from Kellex to produce a workable design for a pilot plant. Libby conducted a series of tests that indicated that the Norris-Adler barrier would work, and he remained confident that with an all-out effort, the remaining problems with it could be solved. Although doubts remained, construction work began on the K-25 full-scale production plant in September 1943.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to longitudinal studies, {{there has been}} psychophysiological research on the biology of attachment. Research has begun to include neural development, behaviour genetics and temperament concepts. Generally, temperament and attachment constitute separate developmental domains, but aspects of both contribute {{to a range of}} interpersonal and intrapersonal developmental outcomes. Some types of temperament may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>developing</b> attachment disorders.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{designer}} Mike Posehn had no {{video game}} experience prior <b>to</b> <b>developing</b> Desert Strike. Inspired by Choplifter, he aimed {{to create a}} nonlinear game with smoothly animated vehicles. Posehn developed a camera system with momentum to mimic realistic helicopter movements. Three-dimensional (3D) modeling was used to generate the vehicle sprites, which were later touched up on the pixel level with color.|$|E
5|$|Megadeth's {{previous}} studio release, Countdown to Extinction, {{became the}} band's biggest commercial accomplishment, entering the Billboard 200 at number two and eventually becoming double platinum. As a result, they continually sold out arenas across North America, in addition <b>to</b> <b>developing</b> a strong following overseas. With the next album, Youthanasia, the band moved towards a more mainstream sound.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{said that}} he was working on defense {{balloons}} that could stop them in case of an attack against the United States through a company in Chicago, known as the Chicago Captive Balloon Company. The newspapers printed a counterview that warned against Jingoism and starting rumors that could lead <b>to</b> <b>developing</b> unwanted war airships or a cause for other nations to make military equipment against this new war technology.|$|E

5|$|The 1973 {{oil embargo}} and 1979 energy crisis caused a {{reorganization}} of energy policies {{around the world}} and brought renewed attention <b>to</b> <b>developing</b> solar technologies.

Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the U.S. (SERI, now NREL), Japan (NEDO), and Germany (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE).|$|E

5|$|Weissenburg {{served with}} the I Division during {{the first decade of}} her service with the fleet. This period was {{generally}} limited to training exercises and goodwill visits to foreign ports. These training maneuvers were nevertheless very important <b>to</b> <b>developing</b> German naval tactical doctrine in the two decades before World War I, especially under the direction of Alfred von Tirpitz. Weissenburg, along with her three sisters, saw only one major overseas deployment during this period, to China in 1900–1901, during the Boxer Rebellion. The ship underwent a major modernization in 1904–1905.|$|E
5|$|Brandenburg {{served with}} the I Division during {{the first decade of}} her service with the fleet. This period was {{generally}} limited to training exercises and goodwill visits to foreign ports. These training maneuvers were nevertheless very important <b>to</b> <b>developing</b> German naval tactical doctrine in the two decades before World War I, especially under the direction of Alfred von Tirpitz. The ship saw her first major deployment in 1900, when she and her three sister ships were deployed to China to suppress the Boxer Rebellion. In the early 1900s, all four ships were heavily rebuilt. She was obsolete by the start of World War I and only served in a limited capacity, initially as a coastal defense ship. In December 1915, she was withdrawn from active service and converted into a barracks ship. Brandenburg was scrapped in Danzig, after the war, in 1920.|$|E
