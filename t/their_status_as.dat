5|$|By {{the time}} United kicked off their final home {{game of the}} season, Arsenal had {{recorded}} a tenth straight league victory at home to Everton and ensured <b>their</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> champions {{for the first time}} in seven years. Frenchman Arsène Wenger also became the first foreign manager to get his hands on the coveted trophy since its inception, in only his first full campaign. He completed a double three weeks later by winning the FA Cup, regarded by many fans and pundits alike as unthinkable given the circumstances four months ago.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, the Philippines was ceded by Spain to the United States and, after a {{conflict}} between Philippine independence forces and the United States, Filipinos were allowed to immigrate freely to the United States as U.S. nationals. Most immigrants chose to settle in the Territory of Hawaii and the West coast. In 1934, U.S. policy changed and <b>their</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> nationals was revoked.|$|E
5|$|Laurie Mains {{replaced}} Wyllie in 1992, and {{was given}} the job of preparing the side for the 1995 event in South Africa. New Zealand were again one of the favourites to take the championship. <b>Their</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> favourites was enhanced when a young Jonah Lomu scored four tries against England in the 45–29 semi-final win. They managed to take hosts South Africa to extra time in the final, before losing 15-12 to Joel Stransky's drop goal.|$|E

5|$|Researchers have {{discovered}} archaeological evidence of musical instruments {{in many parts}} of the world.

Consensus solidifies about artifacts dated back to around 37,000 years old and later. Only artifacts made from durable materials or using durable methods tend to survive. As such, the specimens found cannot be irrefutably placed as the earliest musical instruments.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech and Auburn each earned {{automatic}} {{spots in}} a BCS bowl game due to <b>their</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> conference champions, and were {{selected by the}} 2005 Sugar Bowl. Virginia Tech finished the season 10–2 and was named ACC football champion its first year in the conference. Auburn, meanwhile, finished the season undefeated at 12–0, and was named champion of the SEC. Controversy erupted around Auburn's selection, as the Tigers had been denied {{a spot in the}} national championship game in favor of two other undefeated teams: the University of Southern California (USC) and Oklahoma.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{start to}} the season saw Arsenal top the league table after four matches. The team's draw at Manchester United in September marked an unsavoury episode between both clubs: several Arsenal players were charged and fined {{accordingly}} by The Football Association for their part in a mass brawl that occurred after the match. In November, Arsenal beat Dynamo Kyiv by a single goal and more impressively scored five against Inter Milan at the San Siro – two results which kick-started their Champions League campaign. At {{the turn of the}} year, the team won nine league matches in a row to consolidate first position. In the first week of April, they were eliminated from the FA Cup and Champions League, {{but by the end of}} the month had secured <b>their</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> league champions, with a 2–2 draw against local rivals Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E

5|$|Appeals {{were made}} by public figures and {{screened}} at football matches across Britain. Between May 2007 and March 2008, the Fund received £1,846,178, including £1.4 million through the bank, £390,000 online, and £64,000 from merchandise. Donations included £250,000 from the News of the World, £250,000 from Sir Philip Green, $50,000 from Simon Cowell, and $25,000 from Coleen Rooney. J. K. Rowling and Richard Branson made large donations; Branson donated £100,000 to a legal fund for the McCanns. The fund did not cover the couple's legal costs arising from <b>their</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> arguidos, but it was criticized in October 2007 for having made two of the McCanns' mortgage payments, before they were made arguidos.|$|E
5|$|As King William {{intensely}} {{disliked the}} Duchess and Conroy, {{he vowed to}} wait until Victoria came of age to die simply {{to keep them from}} a regency. In 1831, the year of William's coronation, Conroy and the Duchess embarked on a series of royal tours with Victoria to expose her to the people and solidify <b>their</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> potential regents. On one trip Conroy was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Oxford. Their efforts were ultimately successful and, in November 1831, it was declared that the Duchess would be sole regent in the event of Victoria's young queenship, while Conroy could claim to be the closest adviser to the Duchess and her daughter.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian {{physicist}} Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists— Frisch and Rudolf Peierls—the task {{of investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} an atomic bomb, ironically because <b>their</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within {{an order of magnitude}} of 10kg, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. Research into how uranium isotope separation (uranium enrichment) could be achieved assumed enormous importance. Frisch's first thought about how this could be achieved was with liquid thermal diffusion.|$|E

5|$|At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian {{physicist}} Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists—Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls—the task {{of investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} an atomic bomb, ironically because <b>their</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within {{an order of magnitude}} of 10kg, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. The British Maud Committee then unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an atomic bomb. Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research, so the Tizard Mission's John Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced.|$|E
5|$|Because of <b>their</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> {{the largest}} {{warships}} in the U.S. Navy, {{the deployment of}} an aircraft carrier can fulfill a symbolic role, not {{just in terms of}} a deterrent to an enemy, but often as a diplomatic tool, in strengthening relations with allies and potential allies. The latter of these functions can take place either as a single visit to a country, in which senior naval officers are allowed to observe the operating of the carrier and to interact with its senior officers, or as part of an international task force. This can be in combat operations, such as NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, or other deployments involving training, such as Exercise RIMPAC. In addition, carriers have participated in international Maritime security operations, combating piracy in the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Somalia.|$|E
5|$|Mahayana, writing elsewhere, sees Karman as {{undergoing}} {{an existential}} quest {{to establish his}} identity, seemingly finding an answer in the PKI but ultimately becoming trapped by them. Mahayana indicates that a religious message is evident beginning with the novel's opening, in which Tohari provides a four-line quote from an old Javanese text regarding faith and becoming more explicit later on. He finds Karman's dealing with the raftsman Kastagethek while escaping from the government the most explicit expression of Tohari's intent; unlike Karman, Kastagethek is a devout yet simple man who is happy in his poverty, leading Karman to question his own views before ultimately finding his identity in Islam. Mahayana thus argued that Kubah was meant as dawah, or Islamic preaching, with its message that humans should recognise <b>their</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> creatures of God conveyed through characters' dialogue and actions.|$|E

This reflects the likely increase in disturbances to their habitat caused by human activities, in particular {{on the island of}} Katchal. The Wildlife Institute of India however registered <b>their</b> <b>status</b> in 2002 <b>as</b> critically endangered, reflecting also their concerns that conservation efforts with regards to a defined captive breeding programme were deficient.|$|R

5|$|Malta's fortifications are {{featured}} {{a number of}} times on the islands' heraldry. The coat of arms of Malta contains a mural crown in gold with a sally port and eight turrets (five of which are visible), which represents the fortifications as well as Malta's status as a city-state. The coats of arms of the five regions of Malta have a similar crown but with five turrets, all of which are visible. A mural crown with four visible turrets can be seen on the coats of arms of Valletta, Mdina and Birgu, indicating <b>their</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> capital city or former capitals. Another version with four turrets (three visible) can be seen on the coats of arms of Cospicua, Senglea, Qormi, Siġġiewi, Żabbar, Żebbuġ, Żejtun and Victoria, indicating the status of a city.|$|E
5|$|The 1957 Yankees {{reached that}} year's World Series, but lost in seven games to the Milwaukee Braves. Following the Series, the Giants and Dodgers left New York City for California, leaving the Yankees as New York's only MLB team. Despite <b>their</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> the sole New York City-based franchise, the Yankees' 1958 {{attendance}} decreased from previous seasons {{as the team}} could not attract bereft Giants and Dodgers fans. In the 1958 World Series, the Yankees {{had an opportunity to}} avenge their defeat to the Braves. The Yankees fell behind by losing three of the first four games, but won the final three games of the Series to claim another championship. The Yankees were unable to defend their AL and World Series championships in 1959, as they ended up with a 79–75 record, their worst record since 1925, good for third place.|$|E
5|$|The concept {{behind the}} group was that each member is a multi-generational wrestler. The name of the faction, The Legacy, {{referred}} to their extensive family histories in wrestling. Randy Orton's father (Bob Orton, Jr.), uncle (Barry Orton) and grandfather (Bob Orton, Sr.) were all professional wrestlers. Ted DiBiase, meanwhile, takes his name from his father, (Ted DiBiase) who wrestled before him along with both his grandparents (adoptive grandfather, Mike DiBiase and grandmother Helen Hild). Cody Rhodes followed {{in the footsteps of}} his father (Dusty Rhodes) and his two uncles (Jerry Sags and Fred Ottman), who preceded him in the business. Due to <b>their</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> multi-generation wrestlers, all the members of The Legacy believed themselves to be superior to the other wrestlers in WWE, in storyline.|$|E

5|$|The horses' senses {{are based}} on <b>their</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> prey animals, where they {{must be aware of}} their {{surroundings}} at all times. They have the largest eyes of any land mammal, and are lateral-eyed, meaning that their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads. This means that horses have a range of vision of more than 350°, with approximately 65° of this being binocular vision and the remaining 285° monocular vision. Horses have excellent day and night vision, but they have two-color, or dichromatic vision; their color vision is somewhat like red-green color blindness in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear as a shade of green.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Marie urged Ferdinand to ally himself with the Triple Entente and declare war on Germany, which he eventually did in 1916. During {{the early stages of}} fighting, Bucharest was occupied by the Central Powers and Marie, Ferdinand and their five children took refuge in Moldavia. There, she and her three daughters acted as nurses in military hospitals, caring for soldiers who were wounded or afflicted by cholera. On 1 December 1918, the province of Transylvania, following Bessarabia and Bukovina, united with the Old Kingdom. Marie, now queen of Greater Romania, attended the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, where she campaigned for international recognition of the enlarged Romania. In 1922, she and Ferdinand were crowned in a specially-built cathedral in the ancient city of Alba Iulia, in an elaborate ceremony which mirrored <b>their</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> queen and king of a united state.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, George and May {{toured the}} British Empire. Their tour {{included}} Gibraltar, Malta, Port Said, Aden, Ceylon, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Mauritius, South Africa, Canada, and the Colony of Newfoundland. The tour {{was designed by}} Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain {{with the support of}} Prime Minister Lord Salisbury to reward the Dominions for their participation in the South African War of 1899–1902. George presented thousands of specially designed South African War medals to colonial troops. In South Africa, the royal party met civic leaders, African leaders, and Boer prisoners, and was greeted by elaborate decorations, expensive gifts, and fireworks displays. Despite this, not all residents responded favourably to the tour. Many white Cape Afrikaners resented the display and expense, the war having weakened their capacity to reconcile their Afrikaner-Dutch culture with <b>their</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> British subjects. Critics in the English-language press decried the enormous cost at a time when families faced severe hardship.|$|E
