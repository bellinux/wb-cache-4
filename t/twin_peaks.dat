5|$|Actress Sheryl Lee {{was first}} {{cast as the}} {{deceased}} character Laura Palmer in <b>Twin</b> <b>Peaks.</b> However, Lynch soon asked her to play the second role of Madeline Ferguson throughout the series; Lee would reprise her role as Palmer in the series' feature-film sequel , and made a brief appearance in Wild at Heart, which was filmed concurrently with <b>Twin</b> <b>Peaks.</b> Wild at Heart featured several other <b>Twin</b> <b>Peaks</b> alumni, including Grace Zabriskie, David Patrick Kelly and Jack Nance.|$|E
5|$|The {{first season}} of <b>Twin</b> <b>Peaks</b> began airing during the 1989–90 United States network {{television}} schedule on April 8, 1990. It consists of eight episodes. The pilot opens {{with the discovery}} of the plastic-wrapped body of popular high school student Laura Palmer, an event which moves residents of the small town of <b>Twin</b> <b>Peaks,</b> Washington. Sheriff Harry S. Truman investigates Palmer's murder in conjunction with Dale Cooper, an eccentric FBI agent. As Cooper settles into his life in <b>Twin</b> <b>Peaks,</b> he meets the town's residents, who each prove bizarre and quirky in their respective ways. As the series progresses, the seemingly normal appearance of the town begins to fade, revealing various secrets that expose <b>Twin</b> <b>Peaks</b> as the disturbed, unsettling town that it is.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{has also}} {{branched}} out into television, and later, internet-based series. His {{first foray into}} the medium was <b>Twin</b> <b>Peaks,</b> {{a joint venture with}} Mark Frost. <b>Twin</b> <b>Peaks</b> became a cult success, leading to Lynch and Frost working together on a number of other projects, including On the Air, and American Chronicles. In 2002 Lynch began producing two series of shorts released through his official website—the Flash-animated DumbLand, and Rabbits. Having begun acting in his 1972 short The Amputee, Lynch went on to appear on-camera in <b>Twin</b> <b>Peaks,</b> Zelly and Me and Dune. From 2007, Lynch has appeared in a recurring voice role in the animated series The Cleveland Show.|$|E

5|$|<b>Twin</b> <b>Peaks</b> is an American {{television}} serial drama {{created by}} Lynch and Mark Frost. The series follows the investigation headed by FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan), {{of the murder}} of a popular teenager and homecoming queen, Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). <b>Twin</b> <b>Peaks</b> features a large ensemble cast, including Michael Ontkean, Mädchen Amick, Dana Ashbrook, Richard Beymer, Lara Flynn Boyle, Joan Chen, Eric Da Re, Sherilyn Fenn, Warren Frost, Harry Goaz, Michael Horse, Piper Laurie, Peggy Lipton, James Marshall, Everett McGill, Jack Nance, Kimmy Robertson, Russ Tamblyn, Kenneth Welsh and Ray Wise.|$|E

40|$|<b>Twin</b> <b>peak</b> {{quasi-periodic}} oscillations (QPOs) {{appear in}} the X-ray power-density spectra of several accreting low-mass neutron star (NS) binaries. Observations of the peculiar Z-source Circinus X- 1 display unusually low QPO frequencies. Using these observations, we have previously considered the relativistic precession (RP) <b>twin</b> <b>peak</b> QPO model to estimate the mass of central NS in Circinus X- 1. We have shown that such an estimate results in a specific mass-angular-momentum (M-j) relation rather than a single preferred combination of M and j. Here we confront our previous results with another binary, the atoll source 4 U 1636 - 53 that displays the <b>twin</b> <b>peak</b> QPOs at very high frequencies, and extend the consideration to various <b>twin</b> <b>peak</b> QPO models. In analogy to the RP model, we find that these imply their own specific M-j relations. We explore these relations for both sources and note differences in the chi-square behavior that represent a dichotomy between high- and low-frequency sources. Based on the RP model, we demonstrate that this dichotomy is related to a strong variability of the model predictive power across the frequency plane. This variability naturally comes from the radial dependence of characteristic frequencies of orbital motion. As a consequence, the restrictions on the models resulting from observations of low-frequency sources are weaker {{than those in the}} case of high-frequency sources. Finally we also discuss the need for a correction to the RP model and consider the removing of M-j degeneracies, based on the <b>twin</b> <b>peak</b> QPO-independent angular momentum estimates.

50|$|Following World War I, other {{mountaineering}} firsts occurred. In 1923, American climbers James Munroe Thorington and W. S.

40|$|Abstract: High {{frequency}} quasi-periodic oscillations (HF QPOs) {{are characteristic}} for the X-ray power-density spectra {{of a few}} microquasars and low mass X-ray binaries. Sometimes there appear the <b>twin</b> <b>peak</b> QPOs and then the frequency ratio for the peaks is close or equal to 3 / 2. Mostly the QPOs models assume oscillations of toroidal structures near black holes or neutron stars. At present, {{there is no consensus}} on the origin of QPOs. Here we present the model of the twin-peak QPOs as a result of oscillations defined by torus and a ring inside it. We use the Scale-Symmetric Theory (SST), especially the revised theory of black holes and accretion discs. Within presented here model we calculated the masses of the <b>twin</b> <b>peak</b> QPO microquasars. Obtained theoretical results are consistent with observational data. But accuracy of the observational data is very low whereas of the theoretical results is very high so future more precise observational data can be used to verify presented here model. We showed some analogy between the phenomena inside the core of baryons and the phenomena leading to the <b>twin</b> <b>peak</b> QPOs i. e. we showed some analogy between particle physics and cosmology. 1...|$|R

40|$|Using known {{frequencies}} of the <b>twin</b> <b>peak</b> high-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations (HF QPOs) and known mass M {{of the central}} black hole, the black-hole dimensionless spin a can be determined assuming a concrete version of the resonance model. However, large range of observationally limited values of the black hole mass implies a low precision of the spin estimates. We discuss the possibility of higher precision of the black hole spin measurements {{in the framework of}} multi-resonance model inspired by observations of more than two HF QPOs in some black hole sources. We determine the spin and mass dependence of the <b>twin</b> <b>peak</b> frequencies with a general rational ratio n:m assuming a non-linear resonance of oscillations with the epicyclic and Keplerian frequencies or their combinations. In the multi-resonant model, the <b>twin</b> <b>peak</b> resonances are combined properly to give the observed frequency set. We focus on the special case of duplex frequencies, when the top, bottom, or mixed frequency is common at two different radii where the resonances occur giving triple frequency sets.

40|$|<b>Twin</b> <b>peak</b> high {{frequency}} quasi-periodic oscillations (HF QPOs) {{observed in the}} power spectra of Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs), with either a black hole or a neutron star, have central frequencies that are typical of the orbital motion time-scale close to the compact object. Thus, twin HF QPOs might carry the fingerprint of physical effects in a strongly curved space-time. We study the azimuth phase ϕ(t) for orbital motion in the Schwarzschild metric and calculate the power spectra to check whether they display the features seen in the observed ones. We show that the timing of ϕ(t) on non-closed orbits can account for the observed <b>twin</b> <b>peak</b> HF QPOs. The uppermost couple of peaks in frequency has the lower peak that corresponds to the azimuthal frequency ν_ϕ, the upper one to ν_ϕ+ν_r. The azimuth phase temporal behavior ϕ(t) on a slightly eccentric orbit in the Schwarzschild metric is described by a linear function of slope ν_ϕ plus an oscillating term at the relativistic radial frequency ν_r. We deduce that the <b>twin</b> <b>peak</b> HF QPOs might originate from a frequency modulated (FM) signal driven by the kinematics of orbital motion in a curved space-time.
