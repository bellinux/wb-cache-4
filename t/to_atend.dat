The paper {{is based on a}} study conducted in Buret District in Kericho County, Kenya. This paper highlights issues on the teaching methods used by chemistry teachers, the teachers ’ availability <b>to</b> <b>atend</b> to various needs of students on the subject, their use of teaching and learning resources in teaching, teachers ’ personal levels of skills and knowledge of the subject mater in Chemistry and the impact of students ’ negatve attudes towards Chemistry on teachers ’ efectveness. The research design used in the study was descriptve survey. The target populaton comprised Form Four students in ten selected secondary schools in Buret District of Rif Valley Province Kenya. Stratfed random sampling technique was used to select the study sample. Schools were selected from the following categories: Girls ’ schools, Boys’ schools and Co-educatonal schools.

40|$|In last decades, with {{expansion}} of immunological and biological methods are developed new diagnostical and treatment processes, which enable stratification of patients into sanative groups and trend to individual therapy. Absolutely transparent are effects relevant to leukemia. Present treatment procedures enable not only longer survivance of patients, but often their stable sanation. In present time {{is in progress}} intesive research imunotherapy NK cells, which could be able to finish minimal residual disease after chemotherapeutical treatment, which is evoke by persistant malignant cells. Next advantage of this treatment procedure is elimination of system disease in cosequence of exactly pointed cure. In this work he attended in vitro testing to possibility of utilization imunotherapeutic treatment by NK cells acute and chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic lymfoblastic leukemia. Using flow cytometry methods we detected activation and inhibitory ligands which are recognized by NK cells on the cell surface of leukemia blasts. These are members of MHC complex HLA-E, molecules derived from MHC class I (MICA, MICB), UL 16 -binding proteins (ULBP- 1, ULBP - 2, ULBP - 3, ULBP - 4) and also Hsp 70 protein according to the newest observation. We also <b>atended</b> <b>to</b> detection of expression inducible heat shock [...] ...|$|R

In order to reach this goal, a 61 -item questionnaire was applied to totally 171 students (2 Public High Schools, 1 Anatolian Teacher High School) <b>atending</b> <b>to</b> biology lesson in 3 high schools selected with convenient sampling method in the center of Erzurum. The data were analised by SPSS 12. 0 statistical program. The findings indicated the students to have generally positive attitudes towards most of items in questionnaire. Compared with high schools the students’answers, it was found out there wasn’t statistically significant difference (p> 0, 05) between Public High Schools although there was statistically significant difference between Public High Schools and Anatolian Teacher High School (p< 0, 05). Evaluating in colloboration with Likert type and open-ended questions regarding “attiudes and abilities towards computer use”, it was found out there was a negative correlation between occupation with computer and self-feeling sufficinetly.

40|$|Recently, the Lean {{philosophy}} is gaining importance {{due to a}} competitive environment, which increases the need to reduce costs. Lean practices and tools have been applied to manufacturing, services, supply chain, startups and, the next frontier is healthcare. Most lean techniques can be easily adapted to health organizations. Therefore, this paper intends to summarize Lean practices and tools that are already being applied in health organizations. Among the numerous techniques and lean tools used, this research highlights the Simulation. Therefore, {{in order to understand}} the use of Simulation as a Lean Healthcare tool, this research aims to analyze, through the simulation technique, the operational dynamics of the service process of a fictitious hospital emergency unit. Initially a systematic review of the literature on the practices and tools of Lean Healthcare was carried out, in order to identify the main techniques practiced. The research highlighted Simulation as the sixth most cited tool in the literature. Subsequently, a simulation of a service model of an emergency unit was performed through the Arena software. As a main result, it can be highlighted that the attendants of the built model presented a degree of idleness, thus, they are able <b>to</b> <b>atend</b> a greater demand. As a last conclusion, it was verified that the emergency room is the process with longer service time and greater overload...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Leprosy {{is still}} one of the most {{frequent}} causes of peripheral neuropathy. Although regarded as eradicated in Portugal, is still documented in neuropathological study of patients with clinical peripheral neuropathy without proper diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Review of the cases of Hansen disease neuropathy diagnosed in Neuropathology Unit of Centro Hospitalar do Porto between 1978 and 2013, <b>atending</b> <b>to</b> gender, age, clinical manifestations and neuropathological findings. RESULTS: Twenty one patients were identified with neuropathological diagnosis of Hansenâs disease neuropathy, predominantly male. The mean age at diagnosis was 52 years, and sensory symptoms predominate as neurological manifestation of disease. Interval between symptoms and diagnosis was 1 - 38 years. In most nerve samples tuberculoid type of disease was identified. Bacilli were detected in skin and nerve in 44 % of cases. DISCUSSION: Mononeuritis is the most common presentation of leprosy but other clinical manifestations are possible, including skin lesions. Infection with M. leprae injures myelinated and unmyelinated fibres, with replacement of nerve tissue by collagen fibrosis. The diagnosis of leprosy is only achieved by neuropathological study of skin lesions and / or peripheral nerve, supported by the identification of the bacillus. CONCLUSION: Hansen disease remains a public health problem in tropical areas and, although rare, still described in Western countries reason why should still be considered as a diagnostic possibility in the investigation of peripheral neuropathy...|$|R
