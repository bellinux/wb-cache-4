The solid state NMR spectrum of 15 N-enriched CN confirms the <b>triazine</b> <b>as</b> a building unit. Controlling {{the amount and}} arrangements of dopants in the CN structure can dramatically enhance the photocatalytic performance for H 2 evolution. The polytriazine imide (PTI) exhibits the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 15 % at 400 nm.

The triazine-activated silica is relatively stable {{and can be}} installed for at least 1 month without obvious loss of reactivity when stored below 30 degreesC, pH below 7. It was observed {{that the amount of}} bound HSA reached 120 mg/g silica calculated from the UV absorbance difference of the HSA solution. d,l-tryptophan was selected as the probe solute to characterize the properties of HSA bonded s-triazine chiral stationary phase, and separation factor of 9. 4 was obtained for d,l-tryptophan. Furthermore, the amount of effective HSA on silica was measured by high-performance frontal analysis, and only 16. 8 mg/g silica was responsible for the resolution of d,l-tryptophan. These results indicate that the amount of both the bound and effective HSA on silica with <b>triazine</b> <b>as</b> activator was much higher than those by the Schiff base coupling method. Different kinds of enantiomers were resolved successfully on the aminopropylsilica-bonded HSA s-triazine chiral stationary phase. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|The {{extraction}} {{performance of}} solid-phase microextraction fibers, based on methacrylic acid-trimethylolpropanetrimethacrylate (MAA/TRIM) copolymers, {{was investigated in}} aqueous Solutions using <b>triazines</b> <b>as</b> target analytes and 2 -bromobiphenyl as a reference compound. The results revealed {{that the combination of}} electrostatic forces and hydrophobicity was the primary interaction between the MAA/TRIM coating and the triazines. To improve the selectivity of the MAA/TRIM-coated fiber for the triazines, several experimental parameters including pH of the sample solution, washing step, organic modifier, and salt concentration were optimized so as to amplify electrostatic interaction and suppress the hydrophobic effect. To evaluate the practicability of the proposed method, samples with complex matrixes, including corn extract and sewage sludge, were extracted with a MAA/TRIM-coated fiber under the optimized conditions chosen. The results showed that the extraction efficiency for target analytes was not enhanced, but the matrix effect of the interfering compounds in the samples was effectively restrained and thus the selectivity was obviously improved.

The synthetic approach reported in this chapter {{is based on the}} differential reactivity of the chloride atoms of 2, 4, 6 -trichloro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine. Indeed, the chlorine atoms of the triazine building block can be substituted by a nucleophile at different temperatures, allowing the straightforward synthesis of compounds with a maximum of three distinct functions. Herein, triazine-based complexes have been prepared that can bind to DNA through a platinum unit and cleave DNA, thanks to a Cu(3 -Clip-Phen) moiety. Moreover, a trifunctional complex is reported that includes a platinum unit, a Cu(3 -Clip-Phen) moiety, and a fluorescent group so that the cellular processing of the complex can be followed. The cleavage activities of the complexes are compared to the complex reported in chapter 3. It is observed that the cleavage of the complex with one Cu(3 -Clip-Phen) d one platinum unit shows the highest nuclease activity, followed by the complex with one (3 -Clip-Phen), one platinum unit and the fluorophore. The complex with two platinum and e Cu(3 -Clip-Phen) moiety does not show any nuclease activity at the used experimental TT an Cu on conditions...|$|R

40|$|A versatile, {{relatively}} selective, chemically and mechanically robust solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber {{based on}} methacrylic acid-trimethylolpropanetrimethacrylate (MAA/TRIM) co-polymers {{was developed in}} a simple way and directly coupled with gas chromatography. Thus, using a glass capillary as a, "mold", MAA/TRIM co-polymers were immobilized on a stainless steel wire base as a novel coating for SPME. The extraction performance of the MAA/TRIM-coated fiber was evaluated in detail using four <b>triazines</b> <b>as</b> model compounds, and several typical and important species of chemical compounds including opioids, xanthic alkaloids and phenoxyacetic acid herbicides were selected as additional examples to further illustrate the extraction mechanism and applicability of the fiber. The fiber showed high extraction efficiency for highly functionalized molecules (typically containing multiple amino, hydroxy, carbonyl and carboxy groups) via a hydrogen-bonding extraction mechanism. The maximum extraction ability and selectivity of the fiber could be obtained only in non-polar (aprotic) organic solvents, which are effective for the hydrogen-bonding interaction. The inherent chemical stability of MAA/TRIM co-polymers and the mechanical strength of the stainless steel wire as the fiber support made the MAA/TRIM-coated fiber highly durable in practical use.

"Developments in {{triazine}} chemistry {{continued in}} our laboratories {{under the direction}} of Shapiro...We selected betaphenyl ethyl <b>triazine</b> <b>as</b> the product to be studied for its diuretic properties. Pharmacological and toxicological studies having been completed, we were about to start clinical trials - when Lederle's Diamox broke into the market. It was obvious to us that Diamox was superior to our triazine compound and we wisely shelved the product. This left us with a fairly large stock of betaphenetheylbiguanide. We had for some time considered investigating the hypoglycemic properties of our biguanide compounds... Of the more than 260 biguanide compounds derivatized on the 1 and 1,5 nitrogens, it is unusual that of the 6 to 8 compounds found to be safe and pharmacologically active as oral hypoglycemic agents we found the very first, the betaphenethyl derivative, proved to be the most effective. The compound, with the generic name Phenformin was, after exhaustive clinical evaluation, finally chosen. After approval by the FDA, it was introduced in 1958 to the medical profession under the trade name DBI, about one year after the introduction of tolbutamide, the first sulfonylurea oral antidiabetic drug marketed in the US. DBI, after a modest start, has in ten years since its introduction become the second best selling oral antidiabetic drug in the United States and abroad." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{worldwide}} use of <b>triazines</b> <b>as</b> pesticides {{has resulted}} in their widespread occurrence in groundwater. Within the northern boreal region in Southern Finland, 30 % of groundwater sampling points contained pesticides, and acceptable drinking water limits were exceeded in 11 %. Atrazine and its degradation products {{were among the most}} common pesticides observed. Chemical pesticide degradation in soil is slower than microbial degradation. Biodegradation often decreases with increasing depth. Nutritional factors and soil physicochemical properties affect microbial pesticide degradation. However, their effects on separate microorganisms, and the genetic basis of these responses, are not well documented. The aim of this thesis was to isolate and characterize atrazine-degrading microorganisms, and to find appropriate microbial, physicochemical, and nutritional demands for pesticide degradation. Microbial community composition was studied in farmland, forested farmland, and primary forest soils by pyrosequencing and in gardens, groundwater deposits, and vadose zone sediments by cultivation on mineral medium with atrazine or terbutryn as the nitrogen source. Atrazine dissipation efficiency was additionally compared under stagnant and circulating water conditions. The dominant phyla that increased in atrazine-treated farmland, gardens, deposits, and sediments were Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. The overlap in genera was less than in phyla, while the isolated Pseudomonas strains only slightly overlapped between isolates from surface soils and subsurface deposits and sediments. Atrazine dissipation was better in circulating than in stagnant water, and aerobic microbes from genera known to have atrazine degradation genes, all from phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, were simultaneously enriched,. Based on the results, the application of microbial remediation of atrazine and terbutryn requires special attention to soil physicochemical properties and selection of proper microbial strains. The world-wide use of <b>triazines</b> <b>as</b> pesticides {{has resulted in}} their widespread occurrence in groundwater. In South Finland 30 % of groundwater sampling points contained pesticides, and limits accepted for the drinking water were exceeded in 11 %. The most common pesticides were atrazine and its degradation products. The chemical pesticide degradation in soil is slow, in contrast to microbial degradation in few months. Biodegradation often decreases with increasing depth. The nutritional factors and soil physical properties have been found to affect the pesticide microbial degradation. However, their effects on separate microorganisms, and genetic basis of responses is poorly known. The aim {{of this study is to}} isolate and characterize atrazine degrading microorganisms, find appropriate microbes and conditions for remediation, and determine physical and nutritional demands for pesticide degradation. Pesticide degradation is studied in environmental samples from surface soils, groundwater deposits, and in subsurface sediments from contaminated areas. Microbial strains were isolated by mineral medium with atrazine or terbutryn as nitrogen source from northern boreal region. In addition, atrazine dissipation rate in subsurface sediments was up to 89. 7 % in lab bio-reactors. The results provide information on microbial ecology of atrazine and terbutryn dissipation in surface and subsurface soils. Based on the results application of microbial remediation of atrazine and terbutryn requires special attention on soil physicochemical properties and selection of proper microbial strains...|$|R
