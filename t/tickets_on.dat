Liverpool F.C. arranged for most of the affected fans to receive tickets from an allocation that had been held back for a lottery among their supporters.

During the crisis, Braathens had sold several aircraft and started leasing them back to gain liquidity.

5|$|After the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show, which {{featured}} Mars as the headline act and the Red Hot Chili Peppers as the special guests, tickets for Mars second North American tour experienced high demands. He became the fastest entertainer {{to sell out}} three concerts at the Blaisdell Arena in Hawaii. Since the morning of February 3, 2014, many shows were sold out {{and only a few}} tickets were available on the primary market, the average price of a ticket was around $500 (US) on the secondary market. Ticketmaster also struggled to keep with demand, having to switch from their interactive seating maps for most events. The price for <b>tickets</b> <b>on</b> the primary market ranged from $49 (US) to $100 (US), however in bigger cities the price was between $70 (US) and $181 (US). On the secondary market, tickets for big venues had a wider price range of between $150 (US) to $600 (US). At these prices, Mars tour ranked amongst the most expensive in the U.S. during the summer of 2014, ahead of One Direction and Jason Aldean shows, which had the highest prices for an American tour on the same period. Two months after the Super Bowl, 27 of the 48 dates booked for the second leg on North America were sold out on the primary market. The only tickets left for those shows were available on the secondary market for a lower price than after the game. Nevertheless, the tour {{became one of the most}} expensive of 2014 due to the latter market.|$|E
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} crossings, steamers took the crowds from Circular Quay, although this time only four were needed, while another 600â700 people {{made their own}} way to the site. The ride was scheduled for 3 pm on 23 December, but delays meant L'Estrange did not appear until 6 pm. Although the length of rope was over 182 metres, it was only just over nine metres above the water. The stay wires were held in boats on either side, with the crews rowing against each other to keep it steady. L'Estrange rode his bicycle towards the centre, where, with the rope swinging to and fro, he stopped briefly to steady himself but instead, realising he was losing his balance, {{he was forced to}} leap from the rope and fell into the water below. Although he was unhurt, it was another knock to his reputation. A repeat attempt was announced for the following weekend. Again steamers took a dwindling crowd to Banbury Bay where they found L'Estrange's rope had been mysteriously cut, and he cancelled the performance. The Daily Telegraph reported that many in the crowd, who had paid for <b>tickets</b> <b>on</b> the steamers, felt they had been scammed.|$|E

5|$|Fares on BART are {{comparable}} to those of commuter rail systems and are higher than those of most subways, especially for long trips. The fare is based on a formula that takes into account both the length and speed of the trip. A surcharge is added for trips traveling through the Transbay Tube, to Oakland International Airport, to San Francisco International Airport, and/or through San Mateo County, a county that is {{not a member of the}} San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District. Passengers can use refillable paper-plastic-composite <b>tickets,</b> <b>on</b> which fares are stored via a magnetic strip, to enter and exit the system. The exit faregate prints the remaining balance on the ticket each time the passenger exits the station. A paper ticket can be refilled at a ticket machine, the remaining balance on any ticket can be applied towards the purchase of a new one, or a card is captured by the exit gate when the balance reaches zero; multiple low value cards can be combined to create a larger value card but only at specific ticket exchange locations, located at some BART stations. The magnetic strip-based technology was developed by Cubic Transportation Systems with a contract awarded in 1974.|$|E
5|$|The film {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics; its portrayal of Jackson and his performances were generally praised, although some critics and fans of Jackson {{felt that the}} film was made to profit from Jackson's death and argued that the musician would not have wanted the film released {{because he was a}} perfectionist. Despite some fans boycotting the film, and his family not endorsing it, the ticket sales for This Is It broke international records a month before its release. Records were also set in Japan, where more than $1 million in tickets were sold on the first day they were available. In London, fans bought more than 30,000 <b>tickets</b> <b>on</b> the first day. Record sales were also reported in the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Brazil, and New Zealand. In the first opening weekend it grossed $101 million worldwide. The film sold $32.5 million over its first five days in the United States and Canada, and $68.5 million in 97 other countriesâmaking the number one film at the box office and making it the fifth highest-grossing Halloween debut. On its theatrical run, the film's worldwide revenue gross was in total $261 million, making it both the highest-grossing concert film and documentary of all-time worldwide.|$|E

While the UK premiere of the film was originally set for April 17, the funeral of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher taking place in that date made the event be pushed to the following day. Downey, Ben Kingsley and Rebecca Hall were present for the advance screening at London's Odeon Leicester Square. The El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles hosted the United States premiere of Iron Man 3 on April 24. The film opened in 46 countries through April 22â24, with the United States release, in 4,253 screens, happening one week later.

It was later reported that Cinemark Theatres had also stopped selling presale tickets, and Regal Cinemas had removed all marketing material for the film from its locations.
