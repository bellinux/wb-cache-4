40|$|Abstract — <b>Traffic</b> <b>sign</b> {{detection}} {{is crucial}} in intelligent vehi-cles, no matter if one’s objective is to develop Advanced Driver Assistance Systems or autonomous cars. Recent advances in <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> detection, especially the great effort put into the competition German <b>Traffic</b> <b>Sign</b> Detection Benchmark, {{have given rise to}} very reliable detection systems when tested on European signs. The U. S., however, has a rather different approach to <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> design. This paper evaluates whether a current state-of-the-art <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> detector is useful for American signs. We find that for colorful, distinctively shaped signs, Integral Channel Features work well, but it fails on the large superclass of speed limit signs and similar designs. We also introduce an extension to the largest public dataset of American <b>signs,</b> the LISA <b>Traffic</b> <b>Sign</b> Dataset, and present an evaluation of tracking in the context of sign detection. We show that tracking essentially suppresses all false positives in our test set, and argue that in order to be useful for higher level analysis, any <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> detection system should contain tracking...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{pre-processing}} method for detecting road <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> based on visual saliency map model. Since the road <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> boards have dominent color contrast against environment, {{we consider the}} color opponents information with center surround difference normalization as an input feature extraction, which is effective to reduce noise influence as well as intensify the sign board color characteristics. Also, the edge feature map is considered to reflect the shape characteristics of the <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> boards. The weighted sum of the color feature map and edge feature map finally constructs road <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> saliency map. Computational experiment {{results show that the}} proposed method can successfully reinforce a road <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> board and inhibit the complex background traffic environment...|$|R

5|$|In El Dorado, Sinaloa, {{near where}} the storm made landfall, the {{hurricane}} washed out away roads and destroyed many flimsy homes. Strong winds knocked down electricity towers, trees, and <b>traffic</b> <b>signs,</b> leaving many without power. In Mazatlán, to the southeast of where Lane moved ashore, the hurricane produced strong winds and heavy rains, causing street flooding and power outages. The threat of the hurricane forced the cancellation of an Independence Day Parade. Between Mazatlán and the state capital, Culiacán, the hurricane destroyed a bridge, leaving dozens of trucks stranded. In Culiacán, one person died when he drove his car into a river, while several streets were flooded from the storm. Throughout Sinaloa, several damaged roads left many communities {{cut off from the}} rest of the country. Lane caused severe agricultural damage in the state, possibly reaching as high as $600million (2006MXN, $55million 2006USD). The hurricane also damaged water treatment facilities and distribution systems in multiple communities, prompting the Secretariat of Health to declare a sanitary alert in Sinaloa. Damage in Sinaloa totaled to around $1.2billion (2006MXN), $109.3million (2006USD).|$|E
5|$|Upon moving ashore, Rananim {{destroyed}} {{hundreds of}} homes near the coast, with destroyed <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> and billboards, {{as well as}} widespread flooding. Strong winds caused widespread power outages and uprooted thousands of trees. About 64,300houses were destroyed, and another 125,000 were damaged, leaving thousands of people homeless. Overall, the typhoon affected 75counties, with 302villages isolated due to high water. The combination of strong winds and flooding left heavy crop damage, killing 55,000livestock, primarily cattle, and affecting 4,000km2 (1,545mi2) of fields; an estimated 230km2 (89mi2) of crops were destroyed. The typhoon severely impacted the infrastructure along its path, with 1,163km (721mi) of roads damaged. Further inland, the rains produced a landslide in Yueqing, which destroyed 52houses and killed 25people. In Shanghai, about 145km (90mi) north of the landfall location, Rananim left little damage, although its rainfall alleviated a heat wave. Across the country, damage was estimated at ¥20.1billion ($2.44billion 2004USD, $ USD), primarily in Zhejiang.|$|E
