5|$|The Platonic {{influence}} on Maximus' thought {{can be seen}} most clearly in his theological anthropology. Here, Maximus adopted the Platonic model of exitus-reditus (exit and return), teaching that humanity {{was made in the}} image of God, and the purpose of salvation is to restore us to unity with God. <b>This</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> divinization or theosis helped secure Maximus' place in Eastern theology, as these concepts have always held an important place in Eastern Christianity.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> {{improvisation}} {{was essential}} due traditional {{role of the}} music as entertainment for the entire community. Listeners in the audience expected players to surprise and astound them by playing in their own unique style, and by incorporating improvisation to make newer versions of the piece. If a player simply imitated a preceding player, playing patterns without any improvisation, the audience members would believe she/he to be repetitious and mundane. This also explains why set performance pieces for musical productions are different in some respect—young men/women would be practicing before an event, therefore rarely relying on improvisations.|$|E
5|$|Coutances {{had long}} {{experience}} in the chancery, but little experience with judicial matters. Most of his efforts while in the justiciarship were centred on raising Richard's ransom. As evidence of <b>this</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> raising money, Coutances sent out few itinerant justices during his time in power. Six groups of justices were sent out in 1192, but in 1193 none were sent out, and even the justices based in Westminster held few sessions. Of those justices appointed, like his predecessor in the justiciarship, Coutances used justices {{from a wide range}} of backgrounds, and many of those sent out on itinerent rounds were local to the area, rather than the increasingly professional justices used under Coutances' successor Hubert Walter. The justiciarship during this period was less connected to justice and was more closely tied to the Exchequer, or treasury of England, and most of the power in the office derived from its control of the Exchequer.|$|E

25|$|To {{point out}} 'essential Zen-teachings' is almost impossible, given {{the variety of}} schools, the {{extended}} history of 1500 years, and the emphasis on suchness, reality just-as-it-is, which has to be expressed in daily life, not in words. But common to most schools and teachings is <b>this</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> suchness and Buddha-nature, the Bodhisattva-ideal, and the priority of zazen.|$|E
25|$|Given <b>this</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> biology in the three-factor approach, {{it would}} be {{expected}} that the third trait, psychoticism, would have a similar explanation. However, the causal properties of this state are not well defined. Eysenck has suggested that psychoticism is related to testosterone levels and is an inverse function of the serotonergic system, but he later revised this, linking it instead to the dopaminergic system.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> the {{relationship}} between anthropologists and those they study—the point that, while astronomers and stars; chemists and elements; botanists and plants are fundamentally different, anthropologists and those they study are equally human—implied that anthropologists themselves could be objects of anthropological study. Although Boas did not pursue this reversal systematically, his article on alternating sounds illustrates his awareness that scientists should not be confident about their objectivity, because they too see {{the world through the}} prism of their culture.|$|E

25|$|Bakhtin’s {{notion of}} {{carnival}} {{is connected with}} that of the grotesque. In the carnival, usual social hierarchies and proprieties are upended; emphasis is placed on the body in its open dimension, in its connection {{to the life of the}} community. <b>This</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> the material dimension which links humans, rather than on the differences and separations between them, allows for the consciousness of the historical dimension of human life: for every death, there is a birth, a renewal of the human spirit. This process allows for progress.|$|E
25|$|This model, then, focuses {{mostly on}} “structural factors” {{of the mass}} media, {{including}} “ownership and control, dependence on other major funding sources (notably, advertisers), and mutual interests and relationships between the media and those who make the news and {{have the power to}} define it and explain what it means” (xi). Though the importance of this model and its influence on media studies is not to be denied, later thinkers have criticized <b>this</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> structure over agency, because it neglects the ability of audiences of this media to question the prevailing notions represented.|$|E
25|$|McKinley {{relied heavily}} on finance, railroads, {{industry}} and the middle classes for his support and cemented the Republicans {{as the party of}} business. His campaign manager, Ohio's Mark Hanna, developed a detailed plan for getting contributions from the business world and McKinley outspent his rival William Jennings Bryan by a large margin. <b>This</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> business was in part mitigated by Theodore Roosevelt, the presidential successor after McKinley's assassination in 1901, who engaged in trust-busting. McKinley was the first President to promote pluralism, arguing that prosperity would be shared by all ethnic and religious groups.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the melodrama or kung-fu action films of the earlier decades, New Taiwanese Cinema films {{are known for their}} realistic, down-to-earth, and sympathetic portrayals of Taiwanese life. These films sought to portray genuine stories of people living either in urban or rural Taiwan, and are often compared stylistically to the films of the Italian neorealism movement. <b>This</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> realism was further enhanced by innovative narrative techniques. For example, the conventional narrative structure which builds the drama to a climax was abandoned and the story progressed at the pace as it would in real life.|$|E
25|$|The training, knowledge-base, {{and skill}} sets of both paramedics and {{emergency}} medical technicians (EMTs) were typically determined by local medical directors, {{what it was}} felt the community needed, and what was affordable. There were also large differences between localities in the amount and type of training required, and {{how it would be}} provided. This ranged from in-service training in local systems, through community colleges, and up to university level education. <b>This</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> increasing qualifications has followed the progression of other health professions such as nursing, which also progressed from on the job training to university level qualifications.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2007 {{study by}} MacPherson, {{prenatal}} Diagnostic Techniques Act (PCPNDT Act) was highly publicized by NGOs and the government. Many {{of the ads}} used depicted abortion as violent, creating fear of abortion itself within the population. The ads focused on the religious and moral shame associated with abortion. MacPherson claims this media campaign was not effective because some perceived this as an attack on their character, leading to many becoming closed off, rather than opening a dialogue about the issue. <b>This</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> morality, claims MacPherson, increased fear and shame associated with all abortions, leading {{to an increase in}} unsafe abortions in India.|$|E

25|$|An {{adventure}} {{game is a}} {{video game}} in which the player assumes {{the role of a}} protagonist in an interactive story driven by exploration and puzzle-solving. The genre's focus on story allows it to draw heavily from other narrative-based media, literature and film, encompassing a wide variety of literary genres. Many adventure games (text and graphic) are designed for a single player, since <b>this</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> story and character makes multi-player design difficult. Colossal Cave Adventure is identified as the first such adventure game, first released in 1976, while other notable adventure game series include Zork, King's Quest, The Secret of Monkey Island, and Myst.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> {{travel is}} {{encouraged}} and {{facilitated by the}} preponderance of online communication in lindy hop culture. Many Internet forums have emerged in local lindy hop scenes. These message boards serve to provide information to dancers about Lindy Hop and dance events in the geographic area. Yehoodi has become the largest of these and now caters to an international audience, although many smaller local forums also exist. Local swing dance related internet forums often reflect the local variations in scenes' cultures and dancing. Because swing dancers travel to dance quite regularly, internet forums are an important medium for communication between local scenes, and for dancers visiting a particular city or country.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, {{the first}} {{submarine}} snorkels came into service. These allowed diesel submarines to operate near the surface, using their diesel engines, and {{without being seen}} by surface search radar. Designs such as the German type XXI U-boat were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than as submersibles that navigated {{on the surface and}} could submerge as a means to escape detection or launch an attack. After World War II, <b>this</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> submerged operation, battery capacity and higher submerged speed continued. In the US, the GUPPY program rebuilt wartime submarines to emphasise this. New Soviet Union submarines, primarily of the Whiskey class, were based on the four Type XXIs that were assigned to them by the Potsdam Agreement.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> the sublimity of the {{conjugal}} act {{holds true}} for both this world and the next: the fact that Islam considers sexual relationships one of the ultimate pleasures of paradise is well-known; moreover, there is no suggestion that {{this is for the}} sake of producing children. Accordingly, (and in common with civilisations such as the Chinese, Indian and Japanese), the Islamic world has historically generated significant works of erotic literature and technique, and many centuries before such a genre became culturally acceptable in the West: Richard Burton's substantially ersatz 1886 translation of The Perfumed Garden of Sensual Delight, a fifteenth-century sex manual authored by Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Nafzawi, was labelled as being 'for private circulation only' owing to the puritanical mores and corresponding censorship laws of Victorian England.|$|E
25|$|Helpful here is J. K. Gibson-Graham's complex {{topology}} of {{the diversity}} of contemporary market economies describing different types of transactions, labour, and economic agents. Transactions can occur in black markets (such as for marijuana) or be artificially protected (such as for patents). They can cover the sale of public goods under privatization schemes to co-operative exchanges and occur under varying degrees of monopoly power and state regulation. Likewise, there are a wide variety of economic agents, which engage in different types of transactions on different terms: one cannot assume the practices of a religious kindergarten, multinational corporation, state enterprise, or community-based cooperative can be subsumed under the same logic of calculability. <b>This</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> proliferation can also be contrasted with continuing scholarly attempts to show underlying cohesive and structural similarities to different markets.|$|E
25|$|In-game {{activities}} may also differ {{between the sexes}} in games with less linear plots such as the Grand Theft Auto series. Women are often characterized as preferring story-driven games or constructive games like The Sims or Civilization, {{but this is not}} universally true. In 2013, Variety reported that thirty percent of women were playing more violent games. Of this 30%, 20% played Call of Duty and 15% played Grand Theft Auto. There has been persistent female interest in action-adventure games and MMORPGs like World of Warcraft and Second Life. Compared to males, female MMORPG players tend to place more emphasis on socialization relative to achievement-oriented play. <b>This</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> socialization extends beyond just the game itself: In {{a study published in the}} Journal of Communication in 2009, researchers found that 61% of female MMORPG players played with a romantic partner, compared to 24% of men.|$|E
