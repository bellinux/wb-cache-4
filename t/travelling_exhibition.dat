5|$|Stokes {{returned}} from a European honeymoon in 1934, but she produced few works {{in the years immediately}} following. Although the Collins Street apartment had become a full-time studio for Stokes, only two paintings and two sketches from the period are known. The most notable is The Village (c.1933–1935), influenced, according to Stokes' own account, by the post-impressionist and portraitist Augustus John. This work was hung in the inaugural exhibition of the Contemporary Art Society, held at the National Gallery of Victoria. It was included in a <b>travelling</b> <b>exhibition</b> that appeared in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1941 and later in Canada. In 1946, Stokes presented the work to the National Gallery of Victoria.|$|E

25|$|The Unforgettable Fire was {{released}} on 1 October 1984. The album took its name and much of its inspiration from a Japanese <b>travelling</b> <b>exhibition</b> of paintings and drawings at The Peace Museum in Chicago by survivors of the atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. The band spent a few days driving around Ireland with photographer Anton Corbijn looking for potential locations. The castle depicted on the cover is Moydrum Castle. The band liked the image's ambiguity and the Irish mysticism they saw in it. The photograph, however, was a virtual copy of a picture {{on the cover of}} a 1980 book In Ruins: The Once Great Houses of Ireland by Simon Marsden. It was taken from the same spot and used the same solarised filter technique, but with the addition of the four band members. For this copyright infringement, the band had to pay an unknown sum to the photographer.|$|E
25|$|By 1919 the pre-war {{sense of}} the Cubist {{movement}} had been virtually shattered. Paris was overshadowed by a strong reaction against those visions of common effort and revolutionary construction which Gleizes continued to embrace, while the avant-garde was characterized by the anarchic and, to him, destructive spirit of Dada. Neither alternative held any appeal for him and, with the Salons dominated by a return to classicism, his old hostility to Paris was constantly nourished. Gleizes' attempt to resuscitate {{the spirit of the}} Section d'Or was met with great difficulty, despite support by Alexander Archipenko, Georges Braque and Léopold Survage. His own organizational efforts were directed towards the re-establishment of a European-wide movement of abstract artists {{in the form of a}} large <b>travelling</b> <b>exhibition,</b> the Exposition de la Section d’Or, in 1920; it was not the success he had hoped for. Cubism was passé for younger artists, although Gleizes, on the contrary, felt that only its preliminary phase had been investigated.|$|E

25|$|A Trades Union Congress Special Conference {{was held}} on 5 April 1982, where trade union leaders voted to support an eight-point plan to oppose the Act. A {{campaign}} pack entitled Fight Tebbit's Law was issued, and a <b>travelling</b> <b>exhibition</b> toured trade union conferences. The TUC encouraged trade unions to refuse to vote in closed shop ballots; to refuse public money for ballots under the Employment Act 1980; to gain the support of other trade unions in disputes; to forbid their members to sit on Industrial Tribunals concerning cases on the closed shop; and to help the TUC co-ordinate industrial action in support of any trade union facing legal action by an employer. A levy of ten pence per trade union member was raised to finance this campaign, which raised over one million pounds to 'Kill the Bill'. Trade union leaders voted overwhelmingly at the TUC Conference on 7 September 1982 for militant resistanceincluding industrial actionto the Act.|$|E

500|$|Jaco Boshoff of Iziko Museums, who is {{in charge}} of the research, {{retrieved}} Meermins plans from the Netherlands, to help identify this wreck among the numerous ships reputed to have run aground in the Struisbaai area. The search for Meermin has employed an airborne magnetometer survey, as a marine magnetometer survey proved to be impractical owing to the shallowness of the waters. Magnetometer surveys can readily pick out wreck sites, as iron items from the ships can be detected by their recognisable signatures. Of 22 new, possible wrecks identified, 11 were identified as candidates for the wreck of Meermin. Six are on what is now land, but have been ruled out as they are wrecks of pine-built ships, whereas Meermin was built of oak. In 2011, the Iziko Museums' <b>travelling</b> <b>exhibition</b> [...] "Finding Meermin" [...] included updates on the progress of Jaco Boshoff's work with the archaeological research team. In November 2013 it was reported that, while the ship had not yet been found, lack of funding was holding up completion of the search, with four target areas remaining to be examined.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the judges}} for the gross out contest in the episode's is Madeleine Albright, who was the current US Secretary of State at the time. During the riot that follows the contest, a <b>travelling</b> <b>exhibition</b> of Van Gogh's {{paintings}} is burned to flames. In the episode's subplot, Homer hires a photographer to take erotic pictures of him. The design of the photographer was based on American portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz. The song that plays during the photographing scenes is [...] "I'm Too Sexy" [...] by English pop trio Right Said Fred. During {{the rules and regulations}} announcement, Comic Book Guy declares that sexual intercourse will only be permitted once every seven years in Springfield. This is a reference to pon farr, a term used in the Star Trek franchise to describe the psychophysical effect of the estrous cycle that affects the fictional race Vulcans every seven years. His taunting of [...] "I am smart, much smarter than you, Hib-bert!" [...] is also to the tune of the Star Trek fanfare.
