5|$|Like all creeks in Lycoming County, Larrys Creek {{served as}} an area for {{settlers}} to establish homesteads and farms. As logging became a major industry in the mid-19th century, the creek {{was a source of}} power for sawmills and other mills. The first sawmill on the creek, in what is now Mifflin Township, was built in 1799. The relatively low flow of water in the creek did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> the lumber boom at Williamsport (as they were on Pine Creek to the west).|$|E
5|$|North of Highway554, {{the route}} is {{generally}} parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> Mississagi River Provincial Park. After passing west of Wakomata Lake on its journey through completely undeveloped forest and muskeg, it reaches a junction with Highway556 southwest of Aubrey Falls Provincial Park. Thereafter, the highway roughly follows the Wenebegon River through Wenebegon River Provincial Park to Wenebegon Lake. Highway129 encounters {{the entrance to}} Five Mile Provincial Park and meets Highway667, which travels east through Sultan, becoming the Sultan Industrial Road and connecting with Highway144.|$|E
5|$|The Somerset River Authority was {{established}} in the 1960s, and later became part of Wessex Water. Tidal models were used to explore the effects of any improvements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> <b>and</b> the likelihood of adverse consequences, i.e. flooding and subsequent silting. Engineering works were undertaken at the Parrett, King's Sedgemoor Drain, and River Brue systems, to try to ensure that the agricultural land benefited from a potable water supply in the groundwaters from the Quantock Hills to the coastline.|$|E

5|$|The {{evening of}} April 6 was a dispiriting {{end to the}} first day of one of the bloodiest battles in American history. The cries of wounded and dying men on the fields between the armies could be heard in the Union and Confederate camps {{throughout}} the night. Exhausted Confederate soldiers bedded down in the abandoned Union camps. The Union troops were pushed back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> the junction of the River (Hamburg–Savannah Road) and the Corinth-Pittsburg Landing Roads. Around 10 p.m. a thunderstorm passed through the area. Coupled with the continuous shelling from the Union gunboats Lexington and Tyler, it made the night a miserable experience for both sides.|$|E
5|$|The island's {{proximity}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> {{the ocean}} {{suggests that the}} area is suited to fishing and related activities, yet the indigenous people, mostly land-dwellers, have long been content to practise artisan fishing, just to supply their own daily needs. Pirogues cut from the trunks of kapok trees are most often used, along with traps, nets, baskets, and fences. In the early 20th century, experienced fishermen {{from other parts of}} Senegal, along with others from Mali, Guinea, and Ghana, developed deep-sea fishing on the island and introduced new equipment.|$|E
5|$|There are {{variants}} {{within this}} tradition. Some versions give {{the credit for}} finding the child to Queen Kirupanci of Chandragiri. Others omit mention of the king of Chandragiri altogether, and omit reference to the Koovagam temple. Instead they focus on the demon Kuttacuran and an apparently impossible boon granted {{to him that he}} will be killed by a person having only a head and who was born from water. Vishnu, incarnated as Krishna, informs the gods that Aravan will kill this demon. With this in mind, the head of Aravan is consigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> is transformed into a child called Kuttan ("born from water"), who kills the demon.|$|E

5|$|To Varro, Hannibal {{seemed to}} have little room to {{maneuver}} and no means of retreat as he was deployed with the Aufidus River to his rear. Varro believed that when pressed hard by the Romans' superior numbers, the Carthaginians would fall back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and,</b> with no room to maneuver, would be cut down in panic. Bearing in mind that Hannibal's two previous victories had been largely decided by his trickery and ruse, Varro had sought an open battlefield. The field at Cannae was clear, with no possibility of hidden troops being brought to bear in an ambush.|$|E
5|$|Transformation {{into human}} form {{is said to}} be rare, and usually occurs at night. The encantado will often be seen running from a festa, despite protests from the others for it to stay, and can be seen by pursuers as it hurries <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> reverts to dolphin form. When it is under human form, it wears a hat to hide its blowhole, which does not {{disappear}} with the shapeshift.|$|E
5|$|Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75) was a {{business}} loop in Saginaw that was previously Business US Highway23 (Bus. US23). It started at an interchange between I-75/US23 and M-46 (Holland Road) in Buena Vista Township. From there, it ran concurrently with M-46 westward into Saginaw. East of 17th Street, the highway split to form a one-way pairing with Remington Street, which carried westbound traffic. About three blocks further west, BL I-75 split from M-46 to follow Genesee Avenue northwesterly into the downtown area. At an intersection between Genesee Avenue, Janes Street and 2nd Avenue, the northbound BL I-75 followed 2nd Avenue while southbound continued on Genesee Avenue. Northbound traffic traveled along 2nd Avenue and Johnson Street to Washington Avenue near the Saginaw River, where the two directions of traffic reunited. Washington Avenue also carried M-13/M-81, and the three designations ran concurrently together northward and parallel to the river. BL I-75/M-13/M-81 curved northeasterly north of downtown, and M-81 left the business loop at an intersection with Veterans Memorial Parkway; BL I-75/M-13 turned north on the parkway and M-81 continued easterly on Washington Avenue. The business loop proceeded northward running parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> ended at an interchange with I-75/US23 in Zilwaukee Township; M-13 continued along Bay City Road north of the interchange.|$|E

5|$|Urquhart {{formulated}} his {{withdrawal plan}} on the successful method {{used in the}} evacuation of Gallipoli during the First World War. The northernmost units would fall back first, moving through the more southerly groups who would then follow behind. The Glider Pilots would organise the routes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> the whole operation would be covered by an intense artillery barrage from XXX Corps. South of the river the evacuation was organised and staffed by men of the Royal Engineers of 43rd Division and Royal Canadian Engineers, using rafts and storm boats. In order to prevent the Germans from learning about the operation, the plan was not announced until the afternoon and some men (mainly wounded) would remain to lay covering fire through the night. Men were ordered to muffle their boots and weapons to help them bypass known German incursions into the perimeter. Some men {{took the opportunity to}} shave before withdrawing, providing quite a morale boost.|$|E
5|$|In post-trial analyses, {{blame for}} the outcome varied. Mamie Till Bradley was criticized for not crying enough on the stand. The jury was noted to have been picked almost {{exclusively}} from the hill country section of Tallahatchie County, which, due to its poorer economic make-up, found whites and blacks competing for land and other agrarian opportunities. Unlike the population living closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> (<b>and</b> thus closer to Bryant and Milam in Leflore County), who possessed a noblesse oblige toward blacks, according to historian Stephen Whitaker, those {{in the eastern part}} of the county were virulent in their racism. The prosecution was criticized for dismissing any potential juror who knew Milam or Bryant, for the fear that such a juror would vote to acquit. Afterward, Whitaker noted that this was a mistake, as anyone who had personally known the defendants usually disliked them. One juror voted twice to convict, but on the third discussion, acquiesced and voted with the rest of the jury to acquit. In later interviews, the jurors acknowledged that they knew Bryant and Milam were guilty, but simply did not believe that life imprisonment or the death penalty were fit punishment for whites who had killed a black man. But two jurors said as late as 2005 that they believed the defense's case. They said that the prosecution had not proved that Till had died, nor that it was his body that was removed from the river.|$|E
