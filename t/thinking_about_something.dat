2500|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Wilson amassed myriad home demo {{recordings}} which later became informally {{known as the}} [...] "Bedroom Tapes". Most of these recordings remain unreleased and unheard by the public. Some of the material {{has been described as}} [...] "schizophrenia on tape," [...] and [...] "intensely personal songs of gentle humanism and strange experimentation, which reflected on his then-fragile emotional state." [...] Beach Boys archivist Alan Boyd observed: [...] "A lot of the music that Brian was creating during this period was full of syncopated exercises and counterpoints piled on top of jittery eighth-note clusters and loping shuffle grooves. You get hints of it earlier in things like the tags to 'California Girls,' 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' and all throughout Smile, but it takes on an almost manic edge in the '70s." [...] Brian's daughter Wendy remembers, [...] "Where other people might take a run to release some stress, he would go to the piano and write a 5-minute song." [...] Her sister Carnie has recounted: [...] "My memories of him are him wandering from room to room... <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>something.</b> I always wanted to know what he was thinking, you know? Who knows what he was thinking in his head? ... We got used to what the whole environment was. It was very musical; there was always a piano going.

40|$|This chapter explores some {{important}} issues for critical psychologists interested in gender. We consider how complex and changeable sex and gender categorisations are {{when we try}} to define them and draw on social constructionist and poststructuralist theoretical frameworks to think through these complexities. Reviewing a shift from <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> gender as <b>something</b> we are, to something we do, we consider two related bodies of research, on ?hegemonic masculinity? and ?postfeminism?. In the process we consider contemporary gender relations in the globalised West, including issues of equality, sexism, and new consumer-oriented ways of <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> masculinity and femininit...|$|R

In this paper, the status of the {{literature on}} production functions is reviewed. Most of these approaches have seen schooling as something that is done to students, rather than <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> education as <b>something</b> that students essentially do for themselves. An argument is developed that makes students the key factors in shaping school outcomes, and therefore a central focus of our <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> productivity.
