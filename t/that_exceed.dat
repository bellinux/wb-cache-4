5|$|Because of {{a design}} flaw, ships of this class have {{inherent}} lists to starboard when under combat loads <b>that</b> <b>exceed</b> {{the capability of}} their list control systems. The problem appears to be especially prevalent {{on some of the}} more modern vessels. This problem has been previously rectified by using damage control voids for ballast, but a solution using solid ballast which does not affect the ship's survivability has been proposed.|$|E
5|$|In the {{improved}} vigilance effect, groups {{are able to}} detect predators sooner than solitary individuals. For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, wood pigeon flocks are preyed upon by goshawks. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, {{the more likely it}} is that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, the rest of the pigeons follow. Wild ostriches in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises it head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds <b>that</b> <b>exceed</b> those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.|$|E

30|$|Unless d' is very large, the two {{distributions}} {{overlap to}} some degree, {{which means that}} no signal strength perfectly distinguishes targets from foils. Thus, a decision criterion must be set such that any memory signal <b>that</b> <b>exceeds</b> it yields a positive identification (ID), whereas any memory signal that falls below it results in a non-identification (No ID). The HR corresponds to {{the proportion of the}} target distribution <b>that</b> <b>exceeds</b> the decision criterion, and the FAR corresponds to the proportion of the foil distribution <b>that</b> <b>exceeds</b> the decision criterion.|$|R
5|$|Rolling {{stock on}} the New York City Subway {{produces}} {{high levels of}} noise <b>that</b> <b>exceed</b> guidelines set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In 2006, Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health found noise levels averaged 95 decibel (dB) inside subway cars and 94dB on platforms. Daily exposure to noise at such levels {{for as little as}} 30 minutes can lead to hearing loss. Noise on one in 10 platforms exceeded 100dB. Under WHO and EPA guidelines, noise exposure at that level is limited to 1.5 minutes. A subsequent study by Columbia and the University of Washington found higher average noise levels in the subway (80.4dB) than on commuter trains including Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) (79.4dB), Metro-North (75.1dB) and Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) (74.9dB). Since the decibel scale is a logarithmic scale, sound at 95dB is 10 times more intense than at 85dB, 100 times more intense than at 75dB, and so forth. In the second study, peak subway noise registered at 102.1dB.|$|E
5|$|The St. Johns River {{is under}} {{consideration}} {{as an additional}} water source to meet growing public water needs. In 2008, the river's Water Management District undertook a Water Supply Impact Study of the proposed water withdrawals and asked the National Research Council to review science aspects of the study as it progressed. This resulted {{in a series of}} four reports that assessed the impact of water withdrawal on river level and flow, reviewed potential impacts on wetland ecosystems, and presented overall perspectives on the Water Management District study. The National Research Council found that, overall, the District performed a competent job in relating predicted environmental responses, including their magnitude and general degree of uncertainty, to the proposed range of water withdrawals. However, the report noted that the District's final report should acknowledge such critical issues as include future sea-level rises, population growth, and urban development. Although the District predicted that changes in water management would increase water levels and flows <b>that</b> <b>exceed</b> the proposed surface water withdrawals, these predictions have high uncertainties.|$|E

The study included 752 high schools in Pennsylvania, including traditional public schools, public charter schools and public magnet schools.
