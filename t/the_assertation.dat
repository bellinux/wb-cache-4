This study makes <b>the</b> <b>assertation</b> {{that the}} {{tendency}} of New Testa-ment authors to ‚spiritualize ‛ or ‚reinterpret ‛ certain Old Testamental cultic categories was not necessarily an innovation. Rather, one will observe {{that a number of}} Old Testament authors already looked beyond the ‚physical‛ requirements of the cult, into the ‚spiritual ‛ and ‚moral ‛ condition of the worshippers. Driven by this tendencey, some authors appear to have rein-terpreted the physical dimension of the Temple and the offerings, looking for alternative way to fulfill the requirements that God expected from the worshipper. This study briefly summarizes the developments of this phe-nomenon in the Greek and Hellenistic world, including Philo of Alexandria, lists the key passages of the New Testament, and analyzes several of the key passages from the Old Testament that reflect the tendency toward spirituali-zation and the reinterpretation of the cult...|$|E

The study hypothesises that, “governance processes and outcomes in CF depend mostly on interests of the powerful external stakeholders”. For this paper which is on CF in Cameroon, the study hypothesizes that, “Power is a hidden factor in Develop-ment cooperation”. Based on political theories, the paper uses the “actor-centered power ” (ACP) concept of the Community Forestry Working Group (CFWG) in Göttingen, Germany, the post-development the-ory and empirical findings, to back up <b>the</b> <b>assertations</b> made in <b>the</b> study through the analysis of thirteen different CFs in the South West region (SWR) of Cameroon.

The elements were derived from the basic assumptions on power made by Max Weber in political sciences and Max Krott in forest policy. The study confirms the existence of powerful internal and external stakeholders that influence CF in Cameroon and aims to em-power important but marginalised communities. It concludes that, CF as a development instrument to al-leviate poverty and increase livelihood while sustainably managing the forest has actually not brought significant or meaningful development to the targeted sector of the society...|$|R
40|$|The popular {{literature}} on time control claims that learning time control behaviors results in increased job performance and fewer job tensions. This study examines {{the relationships of}} one's control of time to job stress, job performance and job satisfaction from a correlational perspective. In addition, a test of a time and stress management seminar {{and its effect on}} job performance, job satisfaction and job stress in an organizational setting is made. Time control is defined as consisting of not only the typically taught behaviors (making lists, goal setting) but also a perception of control of time. 178 employees of a large southwestern social service agency completed several scales including the Time Control instrument (see Macan et al., 1987) and provided demographic information. Supervisors provided performance ratings. In general, the results do not support the conventional notions of time management. First of all, Time Control was not found to be a unitary concept. Instead, Time Control was found to be multi-dimensional, consisting of four relatively individual factors. The factors were: perceived control of time, goal setting/prioritizing, mechanics [...] scheduling, planning, and work organization. Only those who perceived control of their time reported fewer job-induced and somatic tensions and were more satisfied in their job situation. The relationship between time control and job performance was non-significant. In addition, perceived control of time was not significantly correlated with the other factors. Overall, those tending toward Type B and those on the job fewer months accounted for the variance in individual differences on three of the four time control factors. Individual differences due to education, age and minority/nonminority also played a role. In addition, an evaluation of a time and stress management training seminar was made. Acknowledging the limitations of the data on 20 training and 24 control group participants, {{the results of this study}} do not support the claims made by time management consultants. The findings indicated that time control training was not related to increased job performance ratings or fewer tensions four- to-five months following training. Taken as a whole, the present results call into question <b>the</b> <b>assertations</b> made by advocates of time management training...|$|R
40|$|A {{commercial}} surface carburization {{treatment that}} shows promise for hardening {{the surfaces of}} the stainless steel target vessel of the Spallation Neutron Source against cavitation erosion and pitting caused {{by the action of}} pulsed pressure waves in the liquid mercury target has been investigated. To verify promotional claims for the treatment and to uncover any factors that might be of concern for the integrity of a carburized target vessel, some characterization tests {{of the nature of the}} surface layers of carburized austenitic 316 LN stainless steel were conducted. The findings support most of the claims. The carburized layer is about 35 {micro}m thick. Its indentation hardness is about five times larger than that of the substrate steel and declines rapidly with depth into the layer. The surface is distorted by the treatment, and the austenite lattice is enlarged. The corrosion resistance of the carburized layer in an acid medium is greater than that for untreated austenite. The layer is not brittle; it is plastically deformable and is quite resistant to cracking during straining. Contrary to <b>the</b> provider's <b>assertations,</b> <b>the</b> maximum carbon content of the layer is much less than 6 - 7 wt% carbon, and the carbon is not simply contained in supersaturated solid solution; some of it is present in a previously unreported iron carbide phase located at the very surface. Large variations were found in the thickness of the layer, and they signify that controls may be needed to ensure a uniform thickness for treatment of the SNS target vessel. Inclusion stringers and {delta}-ferrite phase embraced in the treated layer are less resistant to chemical attack than the treated austenite. From a cavitation pitting perspective under SNS bombardment, such non-austenitic phases may provide preferential sites for pitting. The shallow depth of the hardened layer will require use of protection measures to avoid mishandling damage to the layer during assembly and installation of a target vessel...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this article are some rekarks on the {{constitutional}} position of the president as a head of state. It is usually said that a president is just a head of state. Actually, in common sense, a president and a head of state are synonyms. It shpudl be indicated that neither historical reflection nor any theoretical argumentation concerning in particular his position as a head of state influenced by the regulations of international law were presented. But first of all range of his functions and competences itself shows that the thesis {{which is based on}} <b>the</b> <b>assertation</b> that a president is head of state is a kind of simplification. The main purpose of this article was to recollect that a head of state is just one of his functions. It may determine his constitutional status particularily in many countries where the system can be designated as a parliamentary - and - cabinet government and where the most important office of the political influence is occupied by the prime minister or by the chancellor. President is not regarded to be responsible for the corrent policy. His main role is to personify the state as it is, to unite the citizens beyond their political options and to maintain the feeling of a psychological need of the formal authority and the real prestige. Of course, a combination of strong pressures in domestic and foreign policy have resulted in a steady expansion of the executive branch of government and have caused executive powers to be concentrated in the collective government. Formally, a president is classified {{as a member of the}} executive branch but in fact the described function simply originates from the former position and from the authority of monarchy. The legal competences resulting from this function are of special kind and they do not let govern or exercise a role of the political authority. Moreover, some remarks on the constitutional position of Polish President were presented to emphasice a lot of oversights and imperfections of the way of constitutional regulations.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2014 Mekansal çevrenin yeşil dokuyla ilişkili olduğu unsurlara bağlı olarak yeşil doku ile yerleşim dokularını bütünleştiren yaklaşımlar gelişmektedir. Antik çağlardan itibaren gelişen geleneksel yerleşim dokularını incelediğimizde, iklim, arazi yapısı, savunma, barınma gibi hem doğal unsurların hem de toplumsal gerekliliklerin mekansal karaktere yansıdığı görülmektedir. Özellikle sanayi devriminden itibaren değişen kent yaşantısının etkisi, çevre sorunlarının da belirgin hale gelmesine neden olmuş ve beraberinde doğal değerlere duyarlılığın da artması yeşil dokuyla bütünleştirici yaklaşımların en azından kavramsal anlamda öne çıkmasını sağlamıştır. Bu çerçevede; doğa ile yapma çevre arasındaki bağı önceki dönemlerde yaşamsal gerekliliklerin kurması söz konusu iken, sanayileşmeden sonra değişen çevre koşullarına uyum ve çevre sorunlarını giderme amacının bu bağı biçimlendirdiği anlaşılmaktadır. Literatür araştırmasına bağlı olarak, yeşil dokunun yapma çevreyle bütünleşmesinin birbiriyle ilişkili başlıca 3 tasarım ölçeğinde değerlendirilmesi gerektiği savını ortaya koyarak, çalışmamız bu kavramsal çerçeve içinde ilerlemiştir. Bunlar; - Kent planlama ölçeği - Kentsel tasarım ve yapı grubu ölçeği - Tek yapı ölçeğidir. Kent planlama ölçeğinde yeşil dokunun yapma çevreyle bütünleşmesi, kentin yeşil alan omurgasını biçimlendirerek ekolojik dengeyi kuran ve fiziksel çevre biçimlendirmesiyle çevre karakterini de etkileyen üst kararları alabilmeyi içerir. Kentsel tasarım ölçeğinde yeşil doku ile yapma çevrenin bütünleşmesi, birbiriyle bağlantılı mekan dizisinin doğal değerlere duyarlılık gözetilerek akıcı bir yeşil doku bütünlüğüne sahip olmasını kapsar. Yapı grubunun parçalı yapısı arasında kalan mekansal çevrede, dış mekan yaşantısının etkisiyle kent ile bağlantı kurabilmeyi içerir. Mimari ölçekte yapma çevrenin yeşil doku barındırması, yapının avlular oluşturacak şekilde biçimlenmesi, yeşil dokuyu kesintiye uğratmaksızın arazi formuyla bağlanarak yapının yeraltına gömülmesi, çeşitli uygulama tekniklerinden faydalanarak bitkisel unsurların yapı bileşeni olarak bina kabuğunda çatı ve cephe bitkilendirmesi olarak yer almasıdır. Yeşil doku ile mekansal çevrenin bütünleşmesini bütüncül bir yaklaşıma dönüştürmeyi amaçlayan bu tez çalışması 4 bölümden oluşmaktadır: 1. Bölümde; temel sorun ortaya koyulmuş ve çalışmanın kavramsal çerçevesi belirtilmiştir. 2. Bölümde; doğal kaynakların çevre politikalarına göre korunması irdelenmiştir. 3. Bölümde; yeşil doku ile yapma çevre bütünleşmesinin birbiri ile ilişkili başlıca 3 tasarım ölçeğinde değerlendirilmesi gerektiğinin irdelenmesi yer almaktadır. Bunlar; kent planlama ölçeği, kentsel tasarım ve yapı grubu ölçeği ve tek yapı ölçeğidir. 4. Bölüm ise; tezin sonuçlarını içermektedirGreen {{areas and}} built {{environment}} integrate {{according to the}} each part of spatial environment that are connected with green areas. This thesis work aims to transform the green area and spatial environment integration into a unifying approach. Before extracting the spatial environment into its dimensions and elements connected with green areas, a definition of a relationship between green areas and built environment is required. When we examine the traditional settlements {{from the beginning of}} the earliest time of urban life formation, we observe that within the context of the natural elements such as climate and topography, as well as diverse social requirements such as defense and shelter form the urban pattern. Likewise, when we examine the period from the industrial revolution began in 18 th century to the present, we observe that the urban life has changed. Therefore, along with the increasing environmental problems the sensitivity to the nature has grown. Consequently, the integrative approach for the settlements and green areas come forward at least in the theoretical area. Accordingly, in the previous periods, living necessities had been establishing the connection between the nature and built environment; however, after the industrialization, it is appeared that the aim which forms this connection is this: the purpose of adaptation to ever-changing, differentiating, renewing environmental conditions and needs as well as the purpose of resolving the environmental problems. Depending on the literature research, our work put forward the assertion of that the integration of green areas and built environment is required to be examined at interrelated major 3 design scales and so our work has progressed in this conceptual framework. The major 3 design scales are determined as follows: - City planning scale - Urban design and building groups scale - Individual building scale In the planning scale, formation of the green areas integrated with the physical environment comprise upper decisions in context with sustainability and ecology considered unifying approach. Due to forming fundamental green area structure of the city and also determining the environment character, the planning scale has a special feature of carrying the distinctive upper decisions. In the urban design scale, the integration of green areas and built environment includes without interruption provision of a unifying effect of green areas in a series of interconnected and flowing spaces between the fragmented structure of the building groups. In the architecture scale, the green area involvement to the built environment indicates that setting the planting elements in open space use such as in courtyards and inner gardens as part of the spatial organization and also integrating the building envelope with vegetation by taking advantage of application techniques. This thesis work which aims to transform green area and spatial environment integration into a unifying approach, composed of four chapters: 1. Chapter; comprises the definiton of the problem and presents the theoretical framework of the investigation. 2. Chapter; examine the preservation of natural resources according to the environmental policies. 3. Chapter; evaluate the green areas integrated with built environment within the 3 interralated scales, these are the followings: city planning scale, urban planning and building groups scale and individual building scale. 4. Chapter; contains conclusion of the thesis. In the first chapter; a definition of a relationship between green areas and built environment is determined. The traditional settlements from the ancient times and the industrial revolution are involved in this context. So <b>the</b> <b>assertation</b> of our work related to green areas and built environment integration put forward. Furthermore, the framework of 3 major design scales are explained. In the second chapter, the preservation of natural resources is examined. Depending on the natural environment research, it is clear that the natural resources are integral part of the ecosystem. The principles and decisions related to the natural resource management and their sustainable use include a comprehensive approach for the natural environmental. Therefore, - adaptation to climate change, - preserving the water resources, - preserving forest areas, - preserving biological diversity in the context of environmental policy are priority requirements. Especially, protecting natural values is fundamental in order to develop ecologically sensitive planning and designs. In the third chapter, depending on the literature research, our work put forward the assertion of that integration of green areas and built environment is required to be evaluated at interrelated major 3 design scales and so our work has progressed in this conceptual framework. According to the literature research, the impact of vegetation in the city was important during the previous periods of communities for different reasons. The vegetation was part of nature oriented planning and design initiatives. When urban forms are influenced by the nature, urban identity is composed with the spatial elements that are parts of urban forms. In city planning scale, green area and built environment integration sustain the upper decisions that relates to city. Sustainability and ecological connections are considered in this context. Planning scale includes the unifying green area structure of the city. In urban design scale, when we observe the previously used open spaces, it is seen that they have social functions such as socializing, coming together, creating a common identity, communicating and establishing a connection with the adjacent spaces. In the period of looking for the ecologically compatible space design; urban design came forward as part of environmental design developments. As part of the building group design development, various green area aspects enrich the space character. Strengthening the scenery orientation of the building, including shaded walkways in open space that are provided between the buildings, creating transparent space organization between the interior and exterior of the building contribute to the urban environment. Green areas are natural elements that have an effective and important role in forming the physical environment. Vegetation defines the urban forms, unify, seperate, direct and emphasize continuity with its dimension, texture and distribution. In the individual building scale; integration of green areas with built environment includes that the form of the building allows for the courtyards and inner gardens, underground building envelops connect with the surrounding topography, vegetation is used as a structural component in vegetated roofs and facades. In the individual building scale, the relationship between the green areas and built environment is composed of the following areas: - Courtyard and inner gardens - Building envelope integrated with vegetation When the building structure form the courtyards, the spatial organization defines the open space. Continuity of green areas into the inner gardens enrich the space character. In this space organization, climatic benefits such as daylight and air circulation also contribute to the ecological aspects of the open space use. The recently developed application techniques enable to integrate the vegetation to the building as part of its structural component. The scope of the building envelope integrated with vegetation is explained as follows: - Underground building envelope - Vegetated roof - Vegetated facade In the forth chapter, the conclusions of this thesis work obtained along with the discussions of each part of the conceptual framework. Accordingly, this thesis conclude that it is fundamentally required to focus on the related major 3 design scale that are following; city planning scale, urban design and building group scale and the individual building scale in order to evaluate the green areas integration with built environment.

40|$|A semi-conserved {{tryptophan}} {{residue of}} Bacillus subtilis tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) was previously asserted {{to be an}} essential residue and directly involved in tRNA(Trp) binding and recognition. The crystal structure of the Bacillus stearothermophilus TrpRS tryptophanyl- 5 '-adenylate complex (Trp-AMP) shows that the corresponding Trp 91 is buried and in the dimer interface, contrary to the expectations of <b>the</b> earlier <b>assertation.</b> Here we examine the role of this semi-conserved tryptophan residue using fluorescence spectroscopy. B. subtilis TrpRS has a single tryptophan residue, Trp 92. 4 -Fluorotryptophan (4 FW) {{is used as a}} non-fluorescent substrate analog, allowing characterization of Trp 92 fluorescence in the 4 -fluorotryptophanyl- 5 '-adenylate (4 FW-AMP) TrpRS complex. Complexation causes the Trp 92 fluorescence to become quenched by 70 %. Titrations, forming this complex under irreversible conditions, show that this quenching is essentially complete after half of the sites are filled. This indicates that a substrate-dependent mechanism exists for the inter-subunit communication of conformational changes. Trp 92 fluorescence is not efficiently quenched by small solutes in either the apo- or complexed form. From this we conclude that this tryptophan residue is not solvent exposed and that binding of the Trp 92 to tRNA(Trp) is unlikely. Time-resolved fluorescence indicates conformational heterogeneity of B. subtilis Trp 92 with the fluorescence decay being best described by three discrete exponential decay times. The decay-associated spectra (DAS) of the apo- and complexed-TrpRS show large variations of the concentration of individual fluorescence decay components. Based on recent correlations of these data with changes in the local secondary structure of the backbone containing the fluorescent tryptophan residue, we conclude that changes observed in Trp 92 time-resolved fluorescence originate primarily from large perturbations of its local secondary structure. The quenching of Trp 92 in the 4 FW-AMP complex is best explained by the crystal structure conformation, in which the tryptophan residue is found in an α-helix. The amino acid residue cysteine is observed clearly within the quenching radius (3. 6 Å) of the conserved tryptophan residue. These tryptophan and cysteine residues are neighbors, one helical turn apart. If this local α-helix was disrupted in the apo-TrpRS, this disruption would concomitantly relieve the putative cysteine quenching by separating the two residues. Hence we propose a substrate-dependent local helix-coil transition to explain both the observed time-resolved and steady-state fluorescence of Trp 92. A mechanism can be further inferred for the inter-subunit communication involving the substrate ligand Asp 132 and a small α-helix bridging the substrate tryptophan residue and the conserved tryptophan residue of the opposite subunit. This putative mechanism is also consistent with the observed pH dependence of TrpRS crystal growth and substrate binding. We observe that the mechanism of TrpRS has a dynamic component, and contend that conformational dynamics of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases must be considered as part of the molecular basis for the recognition of cognate tRNA...|$|R

This thesis {{was developed}} in order to analyze the environmental legibility in the cities of Manaus, Manacapuru and Rio Preto da Eva, State of Amazonas, Brazil. We sought to understand the environmental perception on {{the perspective of the}} systemic paradigm in order to highlight the imageability and legibility of urbanites elements in theses cities. This research mapped out on the multiple case study replication, relying on in interview, questionnaire, delphi technique, field diary and observation in locus. In this way, trails were set in order to not only head the collection of data by direct observation but also feed information to the diary. As to respondents, these one had opportunity to draw their respective city where they has been living, and so they might list some remarkable and essential elements to the memory of a imagery reality. Moreover, a focus of systems was given to the research enhancing the idea that they involve connectivity, integration and totality. The aim of the systemic paradigm allowed to figure out the need for legibility paradigm for the cities which have been studied and also the lack of political leadership realize certain dimension of urban and spatial planning, aiming at treasuring better ways of urbanization, afforestation, and with priority being given to the urban elements and environmental practices for a more assertive city. Furthermore, specific and free softwares were used for projecting the image of each city. This study also broaches the ecological historicity in each city under the perspective of application and understanding in the dialogical process of transformation of urban settings as well as the influence on the current design of the cities chosen for the accomplishment of this research; tabulation of data collected was done by means of the application of identification model in regards to urbanites elements mentioned by Lynch (2011) : landmark, nodal point, boundaries, roads and neighborhoods. Another part of the data was analyzed following the same logic of applied instrument (questionnaire) such as: visibility, structural changes and capitalists, design of streets and qualities as to the form.
