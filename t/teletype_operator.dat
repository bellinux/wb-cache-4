2500|$|According to Kramer, every drama he {{has written}} derives from a desire to {{understand}} love's nature and its obstacles. Kramer became involved with movie production at age 23 by taking {{a job as a}} <b>Teletype</b> <b>operator</b> at Columbia Pictures, agreeing to the position only because the machine was across the hall from the president's office. Eventually, he won a position in the story department reworking scripts. His first writing credit was as a dialogue writer for Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush, a teen sex comedy. He followed that with the 1969 Oscar-nominated screenplay Women in Love, an adaptation of D. H. Lawrence's novel. He next penned what Kramer calls [...] "the only thing in my life I'm ashamed of," [...] the 1973 musical remake of Frank Capra's Lost Horizon, a notorious critical and commercial failure whose screenplay was based very closely on Capra's film. [...] Kramer has said that his well-negotiated fee for this work, skillfully invested by his brother, made him financially self-sufficient.|$|E

Membership {{remained}} constant at about 2000 members throughout the 1920s and into the depression years as Morse operators were replaced by <b>Teletype</b> <b>operators.</b> Many Western Union employees left the CTUA to join the Association of Western Union Employees (AWUE), a company union which had been established by Western Union in 1918.|$|R
5000|$|The line {{typically}} operated at 75WPM, but it operated continuously. By {{preparing the}} tape [...] "off-line" [...] and then sending the message with a tape reader, the line could operate continuously rather than depending on continuous [...] "on-line" [...] typing {{by a single}} operator. Typically, a single 75WPM line supported three or more <b>teletype</b> <b>operators</b> working offline. Tapes punched at the receiving end {{could be used to}} relay messages to another station. Large store and forward networks were developed using these techniques.|$|R

Obviously, this policy meant that the Wacs had to be as well qualified as men to enroll in and graduate from a training course.

40|$|The Aerospace Guidance and Metrology Center (AGMC) has the {{responsibility}} for the dissemination of Precise Time and Time Interval (PTTI) to Air Force timing systems requiring microsecond time. In order to maintain traceability to the USNO Master Clock in Washington D. C., and accomplish efficient logging of time and frequency data on individual precision clocks, a simple automatic means of acquiring precise time has been devised. The Automatic Time Interval Measurement System (ATIMS) consists of a minicomputer (8 K Memory), teletype terminal, electronic counter, Loran C receiver, time base generator and locally-manufactured relay matrix panel. During the measurement process, the computer controls the relay matrix which selects for comparison 13 atomic clocks against a reference clock and the reference versus Loran C. Through use of the system <b>teletype,</b> the <b>operator</b> is able to set the system clock (hours, minutes and seconds), examine and/or modify all clock data and constants, and set measurement intervals. This is done in a conversational manner. A logic flow diagram, system schematic, source listing and software components are included in the presentation...|$|R

A PDP- 9 computer was selected to control and to acquire data. Practically every I/O feature on the PDP- 9 was used to minimize external electronic interface and to make the control program more efficient. The PDP- 9 computer performs the following functions: It guides the operator through the measuring sequence and types out warning messages on the <b>teletype</b> if the <b>operator</b> makes an error. It passes the digitized data through the DMA channel to magnetic tape, and displays the data on the storage scope. It keeps track of the stage positions and the periscope position through the add-tomemory feature. It monitors the spiral reader for any electrical or mechanical malfunction. It checks operator’s efficiency and performs bookkeeping on events measured and events rejected, etc. The entire spiral reader system at SLAC is in operation, and it is capable of producing over 70 events per hour...|$|R

50|$|The {{introduction}} of the Teletype or Telex and the automatic printer, beginning around 1915, {{and the development of}} the Telex network in the 1920s, greatly increased the speed and efficiency of message transmission, as well as changing the work of the telegraph operator. Instead of using a telegraph key to transmit messages in Morse code, the <b>Teletype</b> <b>operator</b> simply typed messages on a standard typewriter keyboard. At the receiving end, an automatic printer printed out the text on paper sheets or tape. Introduction of the Teletype greatly increased the number of women employed as telegraphers; however, the predominantly female Teletype operators were generally paid less than the mainly male Morse operators.|$|E
