This article discusses the theoretical framework for the knowledge structure of <b>TeleTeach,</b> and how the electronic medium was exploited to help ESL teachers with their daily teaching as well as to enrich their knowledge about ESL teaching. It begins with some background information about the conception and design of TeleNex, the ESL teaching profession in Hong Kong, and the need for such a database. This is followed by a discussion of the theoretical framework for teacher knowledge which draws heavily on Shulman (1986) and the ESL knowledge structure of <b>TeleTeach.</b> Based on the knowledge structure outlined, a description is given of how the database is designed to ensure that it is of practical use to teachers with a range of teaching experiences and teaching competences, and is also a means of enriching their knowledge.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the aims of an evolving teaching resources database, called <b>TeleTeach,</b> {{which is part of}} a computer-based teacher support network, calledTeleNex. The <b>TeleTeach</b> component in TeleNex is integrally linked with all the other components. The interactive nature of the network makes the database, and the whole network, unique. The purpose o/TeleTeach is to build an ongoing partnership between teachers and teacher educators, and to help create a collaborative culture across schools. This {{article describes}} the ways in which its unique features may contribute towards building an electronic community of reflective teachers, and suggests that the relationship between teaching materials and a teacher's professional development is potentially complementary. It also suggests that teachers need to be fully engaged in shaping this database if its potential is to be fully exploited.

40|$|Distance {{education}} {{can be divided into}} synchronous and asynchronous <b>teleteaching</b> according to the event timeline. The quality and diversity of <b>teleteaching</b> approaches depends strongly on the available bandwidth (e. g. <b>teleteaching</b> over ISDN vs. technologies with high bandwidth consumption, like MBONE or real-time ATM transmissions). With the increase of available network capacity <b>teleteaching</b> applications improve enormously in quality and quantity. Synchronous <b>teleteaching</b> which was initially just a video-stream based transmission is meanwhile enriched with multimedia applications and changed over to multimedia-videoconferencing sessions. This paper introduces <b>teleteaching</b> scenarios which are based on high-quality approaches using standard MBONE audio/video tools {{on the one hand and}} transmission of media streams with high transfer rates over ATM codecs on the other. These different strategies for synchronous distance education are combined in a flexible technical <b>teleteaching</b> environment, in support of the lecturer by integrating multimedia resources into the lecture and access to remotely connected students. These advanced services led to the development of an integrated <b>teleteaching</b> terminal that is currently installed in one lecture theatre and two conference rooms and is used for the transmission of lectures and practising courses within the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg.

40|$|<b>Teleteaching</b> {{is a major}} {{activity}} conducted {{through the}} medium of video conferencing in Indian distance education institutions. A quality problem arises from the fact that distance educators tend to regard <b>teleteaching</b> {{as an extension of the}} classroom teaching approach. For this reason, all their efforts are directed towards reproducing conventional classroom instruction, without the least concern for the fact that the instructional delivery medium is a technological interface: that is, a TV screen. This study investigates the use of three television production variables for visual reinforcement of the lecture content, to improve the learning outcomes of <b>teleteaching</b> in the Indian context. The impact of specific techniques (i. e. inserted graphics, video clips, and background electronically inserted by the 'chromakey' technique) was measured in three experiments using two dependent variables: achievement, and attitude towards the presentation and presenter. The study yielded highly significant effects of graphics on achievement and attitude; and a significant positive effect of the chromakeyed background was observed on attitude.

The project Tlpoly involves the concept of distributed, synchronous, and interactive teaching. Tlpoly covers the distributed aspect, because a traditional lecture is communicated to a remote site.
