5|$|In the event, {{the biggest}} threat Gibraltar faced in the 20th century came from the air. The only action seen by Gibraltar's coastal defences during the First World War {{occurred}} in August 1917 when the 6-inch gun at Devil's Gap Battery engaged and sank a German U-boat travelling on the surface. The Second World War presented a much greater challenge to Gibraltar's defences {{as a result of}} the development of long-range bomber aircraft. Numerous anti-aircraft positions were established across Gibraltar, many of them built on top of existing fortifications and equipped with 40mm and 3.7-inch anti-aircraft guns. By March 1941 there were twenty-eight 3.7-inch guns and twenty-two (and eventually forty-eight) Bofors guns, plus two pom-pom guns. Numerous searchlights were installed – by 1942 there were twenty-four located around Gibraltar – and rocket projectors, an early though rather ineffectual form of anti-aircraft missiles, were also brought in. Bunkers and pillboxes were built <b>to</b> <b>guard</b> <b>against</b> amphibious landings, especially on the eastern side of the Rock, and anti-tank guns, ditches and obstacles were installed facing the isthmus <b>to</b> <b>guard</b> <b>against</b> a land attack.|$|E

5|$|Castles {{served a}} range of purposes, the most {{important}} of which were military, administrative, and domestic. As well as defensive structures, castles were also offensive tools which {{could be used as a}} base of operations in enemy territory. Castles were established by Norman invaders of England for both defensive purposes and to pacify the country's inhabitants. As William the Conqueror advanced through England, he fortified key positions to secure the land he had taken. Between 1066 and 1087, he established 36castles such as Warwick Castle, which he used <b>to</b> <b>guard</b> <b>against</b> rebellion in the English Midlands.|$|E

Adams had held it proper to retain the members of Washington's cabinet, except for cause; he found, in 1800 (after Washington's death), that they were obeying Hamilton rather than himself, and fired several of them.|$|E

In 957, an embassy from Byzantium brought the tribute from the Emperor for his occupation of Calabria from there, with gifts of gold and silver vessels adorned with jewels, silks, brocades and other valuables. In Italy, El-Muizz planned the invasion of Egypt, whose conquest would make the Fatimids rivals in power to the Abbasids in Baghdad.|$|E
5|$|The British Government and Royal Navy were {{concerned}} about the threat Tirpitz posed once she re-entered service. Allied intelligence tracked the progress of work on the battleship using decrypted German radio signals, photo reconnaissance flights and eyewitness reports from agents in Norway. It was feared the battleship could sortie and attack convoys in the Norwegian Sea or Atlantic Ocean after the repairs were completed. The need <b>to</b> <b>guard</b> <b>against</b> this possibility would also occupy warships needed to support the planned invasion of France. As a result, it was decided in late 1943 to make further attempts to sink the battleship.|$|E

Officials also moved 700people in areas near rivers to shelters in Los Cabos. 32 emergency shelters were set up in and around La Paz. Residents near the coast placed sandbags to protect their houses from potential flooding, and also stocked up on hurricane supplies. Police authorities were stationed in areas around Los Cabos <b>to</b> <b>guard</b> <b>against</b> price gouging. Officials closed many schools and businesses throughout the area, and also shut down the area's primary airport in La Paz. About 500people in Sinaloa were evacuated, as well.|$|E

In the time of Jesus, his fellow villagers in Nazareth made their living by growing grapes, olives and grain on terraces cut into the limestone hills. At harvest time, all 300 villagers – Jesus likely included – would stomp grapes to extract juice, and huddle in watchtowers at night <b>to</b> <b>guard</b> their produce <b>against</b> thieves.

5|$|The fetal {{hypothalamus}} and pituitary {{start to}} secrete thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH is first measurable at 11 weeks. By 18–20 weeks, {{the production of}} thyroxine (T4) reaches a clinically significant and self-sufficient level. Fetal triiodothyronine (T3) remains low, less than 15ng/dL until 30 weeks, and increases to 50ng/dL at full-term. The fetus needs to be self-sufficient in thyroid hormones in order <b>to</b> <b>guard</b> <b>against</b> neurodevelopmental disorders that would arise from maternal hypothyroidism. The presence of sufficient iodine is essential for healthy neurodevelopment.|$|E

When the airborne division troops entered the city, they were welcomed by the Italian garrison and informed that the German forces had already departed. When the two brigades were offloaded, they passed through the city and set up defensive positions to the north. At the same time, Major-General George F. Hopkinson, established his divisional headquarters in the Albergo Europa Hotel and accepted the Italian surrender from the military governor.|$|E
5|$|Although {{military}} {{reform was}} delayed {{until the end}} of his reign, Leopold did succeed in convincing parliament of the need to extend Belgium's defenses. Construction of fortresses along the border by both the French and Germans in the mid-1880s worried the Belgian government that their country might be used as an invasion route. In 1887, a program of fortification construction began along the Sambre and Meuse rivers. Designed by the leading military architect Henri Alexis Brialmont, nine forts were built at Namur <b>to</b> <b>guard</b> <b>against</b> an offensive from France, while twelve were built around Liège, near the German border. Completed in 1892, they supplemented the existing National Redoubt at Antwerp, which was later modernized and extended. The fortifications would {{play a major role in}} the opening stages of the First World War.|$|E
