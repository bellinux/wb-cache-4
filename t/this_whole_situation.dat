5|$|Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{uses the}} {{situation}} to host a sex education class {{in order to learn}} if his former girlfriend Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) has been having sex with her current boyfriend Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). Distraught after realizing that they are having sex and after everyone mocks him, Andy throws a tantrum, hurling a box of pizza at the wall and storming out of the conference room. Gabe takes Andy to his cubicle and admonishes him for his behavior, revealing he is aware why Andy hosted the sex ed class. He explains to Andy that the only reason he asked Erin out was because Andy gave his blessing, which Andy reveals was just a result of his difficulty saying no to how politely Gabe asked him. Gabe tells Andy {{that he is going to}} let <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> <b>situation</b> slide this time and advises Andy to put Erin behind him.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times also was {{impressed}} with the cast's singing abilities, and praised the writers' risk-taking: [...] "that just goes to show how well thought out, creative, and just plain fun tonight’s “Fringe” really was. A lot of people would have pegged a 1940s film noir musical episode as a big risk, but the bigger the risk, the bigger the pay out". Rhee Dee of Pinkraygun.com commented [...] "After the revelation in the last episode, and Peter running away, this episode was a great way to express Walter’s grief and guilt about <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> <b>situation</b> without actually watching Walter talk about how sad and guilty he feels about everything. Walter’s story serves as a powerful metaphor for how he actually feels". Tim Grierson of New York Magazine thought the episode turned out to be simply mediocre because [...] "its noir elements weren’t incorporated in a really interesting way, and as for the musical numbers, they tended to be throwaway bits, save for “fictional” Dunham crooning “For Once in My Life” to the seemingly dying “fictional” Peter near the episode’s end". Grierson continued that [...] "If a show is going to completely throw away its usual rulebook for a fun onetime-only episode, {{it would be great if}} the writers could come up with a story as audacious as their premise. But aside from some Chinatown references, fancy threads, and mildly clever mirroring of the show’s mythology — Massive Dynamic is up to no good in this story-land world as well — 'Brown Betty' wasn’t all that enjoyable because it didn’t do a great job of capturing what generally makes Fringe enjoyable".|$|E
2500|$|The {{proposed}} bans in Boston and Chicago drew {{criticism from}} some liberal pundits, legal experts, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Kevin Drum of Mother Jones magazine said [...] "here's really {{no excuse for}} Emanuel's and Menino's actions... you don't hand out business licenses based on whether {{you agree with the}} political views of the executives. Not in America, anyway ... what makes <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> <b>situation</b> so weird is that Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy has always opposed gay marriage. He's a devout Southern Baptist, just like his father, who founded the company. The place is closed on Sundays, for crying out loud. There's just nothing new here." [...] UCLA law professor and blogger Eugene Volokh observed, [...] "enying a private business permits because of such speech by its owner is a blatant First Amendment violation." ...|$|E

As a member of the Senate Military Affairs Committee, I got to know a lot about our casualties during the war. Plenty of Negro boys were willing to go out and fight and die for this country. Is it right when they came back to tell them they can't play the national pastime? You know, Branch, I'm going to have to meet my Maker some day. And if He asks me why I didn't let this boy play, and I say it's because he's black, that might not be a satisfactory answer.|$|R

5000|$|Later, {{when the}} boys have had some fun, Manny brings up that Luke {{constantly}} insults Gloria, calling her a [...] "coal digger". Phil corrects Luke's pronunciation saying he meant [...] "gold digger". Luke states that he has heard of this term from his mom, having used it through the past year. <b>This</b> makes the <b>whole</b> <b>situation</b> worse with Gloria leaving the gathering and staying in her room, refusing to join the group. Phil tries to reason with her, resulting in an awkward situation. Eventually Claire comes to apologize, but Gloria will not accept it unless she can get even. She tells Claire {{that the only way}} she can forgive her is to jump into the pool with her clothes on. Claire does it, and soon afterward, everyone, except Haley (Sarah Hyland), jumps in or is pushed in as well.|$|R
2500|$|Children of Bodom's {{first world}} tour began in 2003 and lasted until late 2004. The tour had many sold-out concerts and marked the {{consolidation}} of the band in North America, but was also accompanied by an unexpected announcement: Kuoppala decided to quit Children of Bodom for personal reasons {{right in the middle}} of the tour without giving previous warning. In an interview, when Laiho was asked why Kuoppala left the band, he stated that, [...] "Well, I try to be careful about what I say about him because there is no bad blood between us. He told me that he just got sick of touring and the whole band/rock 'n roll lifestyle living in hotels and tour buses and stuff. For me it was really weird because he was always the one who was SO into it! He was a die hard rock 'n roller and suddenly he made a quick 180 turn in his whole life. <b>This</b> <b>whole</b> <b>situation</b> involves a new girlfriend." [...] Griffin's guitarist Kai Nergaard was invited by Laiho to replace Kuoppala, but did not accept the offer. Thus, Alexi's bandmate from Sinergy, Roope Latvala (founding member of Stone, one of the bands which started the heavy metal movement in Finland) assumed the guitars as a session player, until a more permanent solution could be found. This formation was introduced in Moscow on 16 August.|$|E

McCain said: [...] "You don't make things better by making it easier. Its speed that does the damage." [...] Champion jockey Tony McCoy also defended the National, saying, [...] "I personally don't think the sport could be in any better shape for horses or jockeys." [...] Ornais's owner, Andy Stewart, later said: [...] "We're still grieving but I think <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> hyped up <b>situation</b> regarding the Grand National is totally wrong... National Hunt racing is safer and compliant with every single sport that goes along. My son snowboarded in France and, unfortunately, he had an accident and he'll never walk again.

40|$|Space {{designers}} usually {{look for}} information on site before proceeding design. They image any possibilities of design, while they are on site. Restricted to traditional design media, {{if they want to}} develop their ideas further, they {{have to go back to}} desks. This kind of design process can capture only part of information of the site. Why not do some developments directly when designers are on the site? That is the starting point of <b>this</b> paper. The <b>whole</b> <b>situation</b> of site is very complicated, so it is very difficult discussing all the possibilities. In order to understand how to design on site, reducing the variations is needed. Tsai and Chang (2005) proposed a prototype about design on site, which focuses on land forming. So I chose interior as the site to reduce the variation and have more controllable factors. Still there are many factors effecting design on site, scale is very unique and very important factor of them. Beginners are difficult to really feel how long it is on the plan drawing, and even most advanced VR equipment still canit fully present the rich information on the site. To experience the site though body, the main idea is how to propose a portable device that can support space designer to do design on site directly, with intuitional body movement and precise scale, and get feedback immediately...|$|R
