50|$|Arizonan {{departed}} <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminals</b> on 12 April 1919 for Bordeaux, {{where she}} embarked troops. She returned to <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminals</b> {{with them on}} 20 May 1919. She proceeded from <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminals</b> again on 7 June 1919; this time she embarked troops at St. Nazaire, France, and returned to <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminals</b> on 6 July 1919.|$|R
50|$|Undergoing further {{repairs and}} {{alterations}} {{first at the}} Shewan and later at the Morse Drydock company yard, Arizonan was taken in hand for conversion to a troop transport, her armament being removed at the Morse Drydock yard. Reassigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force on 14 December 1918, Arizonan remained at the Morse yard until late in January 1919 before shifting {{to one of the}} U.S. Army's major <b>terminals,</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminals,</b> at Brooklyn, New York, to load additional gear in line with her recent metamorphosis into a troopship.|$|R

5000|$|From 1983 to 2006, the {{operation}} {{was known as the}} New York Cross Harbor Railroad [...] Earlier predecessors include the Brooklyn Eastern District <b>Terminal</b> Company, <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> Railroad, New York Dock Railway, and New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad operations at Bay Ridge and Greenville.|$|R
25|$|Ultimately piers of the {{terminal}} {{became part of the}} United States Army's New York Port of Embarkation which at the war's end included eight piers in Brooklyn including six <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> piers, 120 <b>Bush</b> Company warehouses and two at the Army Supply Base; in Hoboken twelve piers and seven warehouses and three piers in the North River, Manhattan. The federal government quietly returned <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> to private ownership after the war.|$|R
25|$|<b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> {{is named}} after its founder Irving T. Bush. His family name came from Jan Bosch, {{who was born in}} the Netherlands and immigrated to New Amsterdam (now New York) in 1662. <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> is in no way related to the Bush {{political}} family. <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> was unique from other rail-marine terminals in New York due to its distance from Manhattan, the magnitude of its warehousing and manufacturing operations, and its fully integrated nature.|$|R
25|$|Due to {{the decline}} of the {{railways}} after World War II, <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> Railway went defunct in the 1970s, its operations continued by the New York Dock Railroad. Shipping activity at <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> also declined after World War II. The introduction of containerized shipping and the construction of the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal in New Jersey hastened the decline of sea traffic to <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal.</b> However, car floats and transload activity have moved to the nearby 65th Street Yard and, along with the <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> Rail Yard, are operated by New York New Jersey Rail, LLC, now owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey; trackage through <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> has been refurbished and extended to the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal and is used occasionally to deliver New York City Subway rolling stock via the South Brooklyn Railway. The PANYNJ intends to reopen the adjacent 51st Yard.|$|R

Mostly about Bush Tower, {{but at the}} end, {{includes}} four pages of illustrations and descriptions of <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal's</b> Brooklyn services and {{a photo of the}} company's Manhattan executive offices.) ...|$|R
25|$|By 1961, the <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> Company {{sold its}} lower Manhattan {{headquarters}} building (which was soon demolished) and consolidated its offices at the terminal itself. A real estate {{group led by}} Harry Helmsley (husband of the infamous Leona Helmsley) bought <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> in 1963. The complex maintained 95 percent occupancy through the mid-1970s and employed 25,000 people. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> housed the highest concentration of garment manufacturers in New York City outside of Manhattan.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> Company managed {{shipping}} {{for all the}} <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> tenants, {{making it}} the first American example of completely integrated manufacturing and warehousing, served by both rail and water transportation, under a unified management system. At its peak, <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> covered 200 acres (about 81 hectares), bounded by Upper New York Bay's Gowanus Bay {{to the west and}} north, by 3rd Avenue to the east, and—at its peak—between 27th Street to the north and 50th Street to the south.|$|R
25|$|<b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> was an {{integral}} part of Sunset Park. The terminal's fortunes rose with those of the borough of Brooklyn, which had over 2.5 million residents by 1930. The terminal employed thousands directly and many thousands more worked for firms within <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal.</b> Besides its own police force, fire department, rail system, steam and power plants, and deep-water piers, workers in the terminal created their own court system as a form of self-policing. Although the <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> Company went into receivership during the Depression, operations continued relatively unaltered through the 1930s.|$|R
5000|$|Mountain Lake Estates {{was first}} {{developed}} in the 1920s as an exclusive residential area created [...] "to attract the nation's business elite". [...] The developers hired Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. to design the community. Such wealthy and widely known people as Edward W. Bok (long-time editor of Ladies' Home Journal and Pulitzer-Prize-winning author), August Heckscher (benefactor of the Heckscher Museum of Art), and Irving T. <b>Bush</b> (of <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal,</b> <b>Bush</b> Tower, and Bush House fame) subsequently became early [...] "snowbirds" [...] and established winter homes in or near Mountain Lake Estates.|$|R
25|$|During World War II, <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> {{buildings}} were again {{seized by the}} federal government for war use and as a focus for the shipment of goods overseas. Franklin D. Roosevelt's campaign swing around New York City on October 21, 1944, started at the Brooklyn Army Base and adjacent <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal.</b>|$|R

25|$|The U.S. Navy first commandeered the piers and {{warehouses}} of the <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> Co. on Dec. 31, 1917. By June 1918, Assistant Secretary of the Navy (and later President of the United States) Franklin D. Roosevelt {{wrote to}} Irving T. Bush {{to tell him}} that the navy would also be commandeering four of <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal's</b> twelve manufacturing buildings, meaning that 64 manufacturers employing 4,500 people would have to vacate. The United States Navy tied its rail lines into those of the <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> in 1918. Irving T. Bush not only complied but also helped to design its southern neighbor, the Brooklyn Army Terminal, in 1918.|$|R
50|$|Bush Tower, {{also called}} the <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> International Exhibit Building is a {{historic}} 30-story skyscraper located just east of Times Square at 130-132 West 42nd Street between Broadway and Sixth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It was built in 1916-18 for Irving T. <b>Bush's</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> Company, owners of <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Bush Tower's unique original purpose as commercial display space and social space, its notable design that combined narrowness, height, and Neo-Gothic architecture, {{and its role in}} the evolution of Times Square and of New York skyscrapers after the 1916 Zoning Resolution all qualify it as an exceptional structure.|$|R

2500|$|As of 1918, <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> owned [...] of {{waterfront}} in Brooklyn {{and covered}} 20 waterfront blocks. Seven piers extended over [...] {{into the harbor}} and were at least [...] wide. Each pier was enclosed. Twenty-five steamship lines used these piers, and as of 1910, <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> handled 10 percent of all steamships arriving at New York. Eventually, <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> handled 50,000 railroad freight cars and had eight piers that docked vessels from 25 steamship lines. Once freight was offloaded from vessels or ready for shipment, it could be stored within one of 118 warehouses, ranging in height from one to eight stories. Together, they could hold 25,000,000 cubic feet (708,000 cubic meters) of goods.|$|R

50|$|The {{industrial}} colony on the Brooklyn waterfront {{began to}} feature loft establishments, with the <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> Company erecting structures {{like this on}} both sides of Second Avenue.In April 1911 five manufacturing and wholesale businesses relocated to the industrial colony established by the <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> Company. They were the Union Stove Works, the William Wrigley Jr. Company, the Boyd Steel Spring Company, the Cummings Machine Company, and A.C. Agar & Co.|$|R
50|$|A pothead {{is a type}} of {{insulated}} {{electrical terminal}} used for transitioning between overhead line and underground high voltage cable or for connecting overhead wiring to equipment like transformers. Its name comes from the process of potting or encapsulation of the conductors inside the <b>terminal's</b> insulating <b>bushing.</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>Bush</b> Company <b>terminal</b> {{business}} {{became the}} <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> Co. in 1902 when Irving T. Bush bought {{the land from}} the Standard Oil Co. The warehouses were built circa 1892–1910, the railroad from 1896 to 1915, and the factory lofts between 1905 and 1925. Together, <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> offered economies of scale for its tenants, so that even the smallest interests had available to them the type of facilities normally only available to large, well-capitalized firms.|$|R
2500|$|Sunset Park {{began to}} suffer {{economic}} decline even before World War II, {{due to the}} Great Depression, the demolition of the Fifth Avenue El, and the 1941 construction and widening of the Gowanus Expressway. After the war, [...] "white flight", the maritime industry's move to New Jersey, and the deactivation of the Brooklyn Army Terminal from the 1970s also hurt the neighborhood until the terminal was reopened as an industrial park in 1987. However, this decline did not greatly affect <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal,</b> because although its piers are now defunct and its rail system is much smaller {{than it was before}} World War II (and not operated by <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal),</b> the buildings and warehouses at <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal</b> did not suffer the abandonment so common across the United States after World War II.|$|R
25|$|Irving T. Bush died in 1948 and {{a statue}} {{to him was}} {{dedicated}} in 1950 at <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal's</b> Brooklyn administration building by his niece Helen Tunison in front of 3,000 notables and terminal employees. Shortly thereafter, starting in the early 1950s and continuing into the 1960s, the Topps company, of chewing gum and baseball card fame, produced baseball cards at <b>Bush</b> <b>Terminal.</b> Topps moved production to Pennsylvania in 1965 and its offices to Manhattan in 1994.|$|R

Perhaps {{mindful of the}} Dutch ancestry of his family (and of New York's), Bush's 1905 townhouse at 28 East 64th Street, Manhattan, by the firm of Kirby, Petit & Green was [...] "flamboyantly Jacobean, with a high, almost Flemish gable".
