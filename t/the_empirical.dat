Firstly, religious symbolism has a double focus, referring both to something empirical and to something transcendent; Gilkey argued that <b>the</b> <b>empirical</b> manifestation points towards the transcendent being. Secondly, he believed that religious symbolism concerns fundamental questions of life, involving issues important to an individual or community. Finally, he argued that religious symbols provide standards by which life should be lived.|$|E

However <b>the</b> best <b>empirical</b> potential and best ab initio potential for the ground electronic state to date give drastically different predictions in the long-range region beyond which measurements have been made, which is about ∼ 1000 cm− 1 for 9 BeH, ∼ 3000 cm− 1 for 9 BeD, and ∼ 13000 cm− 1 for 9 BeT. Improved empirical potentials and Born-Oppenheimer breakdown corrections have now been built for the ground electronic states X(12 Σ+) of all three isotopologues.
