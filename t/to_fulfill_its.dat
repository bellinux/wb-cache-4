5|$|Shanghai's first {{building}} boom {{occurred in the}} 1920s and 1930s, during the city's heyday as a multinational center of business and finance. The city's international concessions permitted foreign investment, and with it came architectural styles from the West, as seen today {{in areas such as}} the French Concession and the Bund. After the Communist takeover in 1949 the city's development was stifled, punished for its earlier capitalist excesses. After economic reforms beginning in the 1980s, the city is undergoing its second construction boom <b>to</b> <b>fulfill</b> <b>its</b> desire to regain its status as an important global financial center.|$|E
5|$|After {{his injury}} healed, Orton joined the Evolution stable, which {{consisted}} of Ric Flair, Triple H, and relative newcomer, Batista. The group was pushed on Raw from 2003 to 2004, with the height of their dominance occurring after Armageddon in 2003 {{when all of the}} men's titles on Raw were held by the members of Evolution. In 2003, Orton spent much of his time helping Triple H overcome challenges for the World Heavyweight Championship. Orton joined Triple H in a six-man Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam, involved primarily to secure Triple H's title defense, and was eliminated by Goldberg, but the stable managed <b>to</b> <b>fulfill</b> <b>its</b> purpose and Triple H went on to eliminate Goldberg and thus retain his title.|$|E

5|$|Since it {{is easier}} for a snake's tongue <b>to</b> <b>fulfill</b> <b>its</b> {{olfactory}} function under water, its action is short compared to that of terrestrial snake species. Only the forked tips protrude from the mouth through a divided notch {{in the middle of the}} rostral scale. The nostrils have valves consisting of a specialized spongy tissue to exclude water, and the windpipe can be drawn up to where the short nasal passage opens into the roof of the mouth. This is an important adaptation for an animal that must surface to breathe, but may have its head partially submerged when doing so. The lung has become very large and extends almost the entire length of the body, although the rear portion is thought to have developed to aid buoyancy rather than to exchange gases. The extended lung possibly also serves to store air for dives.|$|E

5|$|At {{the center}} of the massive ship, V'Ger is {{revealed}} to be Voyager 6, a 20th-century Earth space probe believed lost. The damaged probe was found by an alien race of living machines that interpreted its programming as instructions to learn all that can be learned, and return that information to its creator. The machines upgraded the probe <b>to</b> <b>fulfill</b> <b>its</b> mission, and on its journey the probe gathered so much knowledge that it achieved consciousness. Spock realizes that V'Ger lacks the ability to give itself a focus other than its original mission; having learned what it could on its journey home, it finds its existence empty and without purpose. Before transmitting all its information, V'Ger insists that the Creator come in person to finish the sequence. Realizing that the machine wants to merge with its creator, Decker offers himself to V'Ger; he merges with the Ilia probe and V'Ger, creating a new form of life that disappears into another dimension. With Earth saved, Kirk directs Enterprise out to space for future missions.|$|E

5|$|When No.1 BFTS {{formed at}} Uranquinty on 1December 1951, it had 377 staff, 37 Tiger Moths and 37 Wirraways, and {{came under the}} control of Headquarters Southern Area (Training Command from 1October 1953). The first pilots' course {{commenced}} on 1April 1952, and graduated on 1August. The first course of graduates from No.1 IFTS transferred in the same month. As well as RAAF pilots, No.1 BFTS trained students from the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Navy's Fleet Air Arm. In February 1953, a prototype CAC Winjeel, designed and manufactured in Australia, arrived at the school to undergo trials. From January 1956 to February 1957, the Winjeel gradually replaced both the Tiger Moth and the Wirraway as No.1 BFTS's training aircraft. As well as these aircraft, Link Trainer instrument flying simulators were employed at the school. By November 1954, following the end of the Korean War, the RAAF's need for further aircrew <b>to</b> <b>fulfill</b> <b>its</b> international obligations had eased and {{the decision was made to}} combine the syllabus of No.1 IFTS with No.1 BFTS starting in January 1955, after which No.1 IFTS was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Franklin Pierce won {{the presidential}} election, and in 1853 made Davis his Secretary of War. In this capacity, Davis began the Pacific Railroad Surveys {{in order to}} {{determine}} various possible routes for the proposed Transcontinental Railroad. He promoted the Gadsden Purchase of today's southern Arizona from Mexico, partly because it would provide an easier southern route for the new railroad; the Pierce administration agreed, and the land was purchased in December 1853. He saw the size of the regular army as insufficient <b>to</b> <b>fulfill</b> <b>its</b> mission, and maintained that salaries would have to be increased, something which had not occurred for 25 years. Congress agreed and increased the pay scale, and added four regiments which increased the army's size from about 11,000 to about 15,000. Davis also introduced general usage of the rifles that he had used successfully during the Mexican–American War. As a result, both the morale and capability of the army was improved. He became involved in public works when Pierce gave him responsibility for construction of the Washington Aqueduct and an expansion of the U.S. Capitol, both of which he managed closely. The Pierce administration ended in 1857 after Pierce's loss of the Democratic nomination to James Buchanan. Davis's term was to end with Pierce's, so he ran for the Senate, was elected, and re-entered it on March 4, 1857.|$|E
