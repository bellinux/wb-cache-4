2500|$|Andrew Conrad of The Baltimore Sun {{gave the}} episode a more mixed review, saying: [...] "My bold {{prediction}} after last week's controversial episode of 'The Walking Dead' was <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>week's</b> would slow things {{way down in}} preparation for the grand Season 4 finale next Sunday evening. Well, <b>this</b> <b>week's</b> episode, titled 'Us,' was not exactly slow, but I doubt it will draw the crowds to the water cooler this morning either. There was plenty to keep our attention, but not quite enough to demand it." ...|$|R
5000|$|TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode a 4.4/5 writing [...] " [...] already {{considered}} your opening season {{one of the}} strongest in TV history. Did you really have to prove <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> by even making Kobe Bryant funny?!?" ...|$|E

[...] "Overall, this was a solid follow-up to last week’s episode and a much better introduction to Jake. A couple of really strong twists (and really fun Halloween costumes) made this a great episode. And as always, let’s finish this up with my weekly motto: More Charles and Dawn." ...|$|R

5000|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode with a B rating saying <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> the show split its plots under the {{umbrella}} of patriotism. On Jay and Gloria's plot, Ihnat states: [...] "It’s always valuable to see the chemistry between Jay and Gloria, as we remember why they’re together in the first place. Jay sold every one of his arguments, fake or not, {{about what it means to}} be in this country. It’s a fairly blatant message for a sitcom, but [...] "Patriot Games" [...] pulled this off in a nicely sentimental way, from teen romance to the culmination of a lifelong dream." ...|$|E

Datak has clearly allied himself with the Earth-Republic, and Amanda may regret not doing so herself - though I think that is unlikely. I suspect that Datak will win the election and come to regret the alliance himself. In fact, {{it may be the}} thing that brings them all together next season - everyone of Defiance against the Earth Republic’s takeover." ...|$|R
5000|$|Meredith Blake of The Los Angeles Times {{praised the}} writers on {{changing}} the Mitchell and Cameron's storyline, commenting, [...] "I'm happy <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> Modern Family delivered a Cameron-Mitchell storyline that was insightful, funny {{and maybe even}} a little brave.". TV Squad writer Joel Keller gave the episode a mostly positive review, but criticized the episode for not reaching its potential. He wrote: [...] "it's one of those things that's hard to put a finger on; it could be that most of the plots were a series of funny events in search of an ending, but it was mostly because they simply weren't as funny as they could be." ...|$|E

5000|$|This episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Cliff Wheatley of IGN {{gave the}} episode a 5.6/10: [...] "It's not surprising <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>week's</b> Supergirl was so mediocre given how heavily it focused on James Olsen, but it's nonetheless frustrating {{that the show}} still can't seem {{to figure out what}} to do with the character after all this time. James' sudden evolution into a father figure for a young alien refugee felt just as abrupt and unnatural as his transformation into Guardian. This episode did succeed in fleshing out the Lena/Rhea dynamic and setting the stage for Season 2's final conflict, but there was too much pointless fluff to wade through." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{changes are}} part of a new {{direction}} for the paper, with refreshed design and more space for community involvement. Managing editor Tony Galpin said <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> marked the paper’s biggest shakeup since it was launched in 1986. The change from Independent to Indy reflected community sentiment, he said. “Everyone affectionately called us the Indy anyway, so it made sense to make the change,” Mr Galpin explained. “The name Indy complements our place in the community as a warmly regarded local paper with a strong, close relationship to our readers. “It’s also a contemporary rebranding, acknowledging the thirst for immediacy in local news, whether in presentation or dissemination. Indy still means Independent, it’s just easier, more casual. ”Mr Galpin said other changes included more opportunities for community input. Readers could submit pictures to new Favourite Photos and Hot Shots sections, while additional editorial space allowed room for more stories on local people and issues. Mr Galpin said the Indy’s digital focus would also increase.|$|E
5000|$|The merged company [...] "began {{to subsidize}} the {{magazine}} last May 1969 {{in the hope of}} restoring circulation, build advertising and make it a self-sustaining enterprise by Aug. 1." [...] That effort was unsuccessful, and subscribing newspapers, with the then-total circulation of 9.9 million, were offered the opportunity to keep the supplement going by paying about $5 for each 1,000 copies. The attempt was fruitless, said Fred H. Stapleford, president and publisher of United Newspaper Corporation, and he announced that the last number would be issued on November 2, 1969. In a letter to the subscriber newspapers, he said:I deeply regret having to advise you that the necessary circulation commitment cannot be attained. It is a pity <b>that</b> <b>This</b> <b>Week,</b> so long a distinguished member of the newspaper family, evidently has outlasted its economic usefulness to newspapers and advertisers... We believe it would be foolhardy to continue publishing when all the vital signs are negative.|$|E
5000|$|Mr. Speaker, a {{few weeks}} ago, a young folksinger whose music personified the protest mood of the 1960s took his own life. Phil Ochs—whose {{original}} compositions were compelling moral statements against war in Southeast Asia—apparently {{felt that he had}} run out of words.While his tragic action was undoubtedly motivated by terrible personal despair, his death is a political as well as an artistic tragedy. I believe it is indicative of the despair many of the activists of the 1960s are experiencing as they perceive a government which continues the distortion of national priorities that is exemplified in the military budget we have before us.Phil Ochs' poetic pronouncements were part of a larger effort to galvanize his generation into taking action to prevent war, racism, and poverty. He left us a legacy of important songs that continue to be relevant in 1976—even though [...] "the war is over".Just one year ago—during this week of the anniversary {{of the end of the}} Vietnam War—Phil recruited entertainers to appear at the [...] "War is Over" [...] celebration in Central Park, at which I spoke.It seems particularly appropriate <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> we should commemorate the contributions of this extraordinary young man.|$|E
