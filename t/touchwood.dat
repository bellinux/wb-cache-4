He played Lord <b>Touchwood</b> in The Double Dealer (1978), the Master in The Fruits of Enlightenment (1979), Old Ekdal in The Wild Duck (1979) and Kitchen in Storey's Early Days, {{specially}} written for him. The last toured in North America after the London run. His final West End play was The Understanding (1982), a gentle comedy of late-flowering love. Celia Johnson was cast as his co-star, but died suddenly just before the first night.

60|$|Upon {{this treaty}} they parted; and Mr. Cargill, after musing {{for a short}} while upon the {{singular}} chance which had sent a living man to answer those doubts for which he was in vain consulting ancient authorities, at length resumed, by degrees, the train of reflection and investigation which Mr. <b>Touchwood's</b> visit had interrupted, and in a short time lost all recollection of his episodical visitor, and of the engagement which he had formed.|$|R

60|$|Certainly if a bad-tempered man can be admirably virtuous, {{he must be}} {{so under}} extreme difficulties. I doubt the {{possibility}} that a high order of character can coexist with a temper like <b>Touchwood's.</b> For it is of the nature of such temper to interrupt the formation of healthy mental habits, which depend on a growing harmony between perception, conviction, and impulse. There may be good feelings, good deeds--for a human nature may pack endless varieties and blessed inconsistencies in its windings--but it is essential to what is worthy to be called high character, that it may be safely calculated on, and that its qualities shall have taken the form of principles or laws habitually, if not perfectly, obeyed.|$|R
500|$|Although two {{accounts}} {{of the number of}} searches and their timing exist, according to the King's version, the first search of the buildings in and around Parliament was made on Monday 4November—as the plotters were busy making their final preparations—by Suffolk, Monteagle, and John Whynniard. [...] They found a large pile of firewood in the undercroft beneath the House of Lords, accompanied by what they presumed to be a serving man (Fawkes), who told them that the firewood belonged to his master, Thomas Percy. [...] They left to report their findings, at which time Fawkes also left the building. [...] The mention of Percy's name aroused further suspicion as he was already known to the authorities as a Catholic agitator. [...] The King insisted that a more thorough search be undertaken. [...] Late that night, the search party, headed by Thomas Knyvet, returned to the undercroft. [...] They again found Fawkes, dressed in a cloak and hat, and wearing boots and spurs. [...] He was arrested, whereupon he gave his name as John Johnson. [...] He was carrying a lantern now held in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and a search of his person revealed a pocket watch, several slow matches and <b>touchwood.</b> [...] 36 barrels of gunpowder were discovered hidden under piles of faggots and coal.

60|$|On {{the other}} hand, the divine {{could not help}} {{regarding}} his new friend as something of an epicure or belly-god, nor could he observe in him either the perfect education, or the polished bearing, which mark the gentleman of rank, and of which, while he mingled with the world, {{he had become a}} competent judge. Neither did it escape him, that in the catalogue of Mr. <b>Touchwood's</b> defects, occurred that of many travellers, a slight disposition to exaggerate his own personal adventures, and to prose concerning his own exploits. But then, his acquaintance with Eastern manners, existing now in the same state in which they were found {{during the time of the}} Crusades, formed a living commentary on the works of William of Tyre, Raymund of Saint Giles, the Moslem annals of Abulfaragi, and other historians of the dark period, with which his studies were at present occupied.|$|R

60|$|The {{strangeness of}} the news which <b>Touchwood</b> so bluntly communicated, made Mowbray's head turn round {{like that of a}} man who grows dizzy at finding himself {{on the verge of a}} precipice. <b>Touchwood</b> {{observed}} his consternation, which he willingly construed into an acknowledgment of his own brilliant genius.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, he {{had taken}} the {{opportunity}} to lecture the younger of the minister's lasses upon the duty of wearing shoes and stockings; and, as his advice came fortified by a present of six pair of white cotton hose, and two pair of stout leathern shoes, it was received, not with respect only, but with gratitude, and the chuck under the chin that rounded up the oration, while she opened the outer door for his honour, was acknowledged with a blush and a giggle. Nay, so far did Grizzy carry her sense of Mr. <b>Touchwood's</b> kindness, that, observing the moon was behind a cloud, she very carefully offered to escort him to the Cleikum Inn with a lantern, in case he should come to some harm by the gate. This the traveller's independent spirit scorned to listen to; and, having briefly assured her that he had walked the streets of Paris and of Madrid whole nights without such an accommodation, he stoutly strode off on his return to his lodgings.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a wild}} {{uncertainty}} about Mowbray's ideas, after he started from a feverish sleep on the morning succeeding this memorable interview, that his sister, whom he really loved {{as much as he}} was capable of loving any thing, had dishonoured him and her name; and the horrid recollection of their last interview was the first idea which his waking imagination was thrilled with. Then came <b>Touchwood's</b> tale of exculpation--and he persuaded himself, or strove to do so, that Clara must have understood the charge he had brought against her as referring to her attachment to Tyrrel, and its fatal consequences. Again, still he doubted how that could be--still feared that there must be more behind than her reluctance to confess the fraud which had been practised on her by Bulmer; and then, again, he strengthened himself in the first and more pleasing opinion, by recollecting that, averse as she was to espouse the person he proposed to her, it must have appeared to her the completion of ruin, if he, Mowbray, should obtain knowledge of the clandestine marriage.|$|R
60|$|We have {{no means}} of exactly tracing {{the course of this}} unhappy young woman. It is {{probable}} she fled from Shaws-Castle, on hearing the arrival of Mr. <b>Touchwood's</b> carriage, which she might mistake for that of Lord Etherington; and thus, while Mowbray was looking forward to the happier prospects which the traveller's narrative seemed to open, his sister was contending with rain and darkness, amidst the difficulties and dangers of the mountain path which we have described. These were so great, that a young woman more delicately brought up, must either have lain down exhausted, or have been compelled to turn her steps back to the residence she had abandoned. But the solitary wanderings of Clara had inured her to fatigue and to night-walks; and the deeper causes of terror which urged her to flight, rendered her insensible to the perils of her way. She had passed the bower, as was evident from her glove remaining there, and had crossed the foot-bridge; although it was almost wonderful, that, in so dark a night, she should have followed with such accuracy a track, where the missing a single turn by a cubit's length, might have precipitated her into eternity.|$|R
