40|$|International audienceGiven a {{multicast}} {{session in}} Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks, {{we try to}} find the multicast light-trees with the minimum power budget while taking into account the optical power loss as light splitting loss, node <b>tapping</b> <b>loss</b> and light attenuation loss. Although light splitting causes non-linear power relationship, we succeed to formulate this problem as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) by developing a set of equivalent linear equations to replace the non-linear ones. The distribution of power loss is analyzed by simulations, which suggests to bound the combined power loss ratio of the node <b>tapping</b> <b>loss</b> and the light attenuation in each source-destination path, and make power-symmetric light-trees by properly using light-splitters in order to minimize the overall power loss...|$|E
40|$|Evolutionary {{retention}} of duplicated genes encoding transcription-associated proteins (TAPs, comprising transcription factors and other transcriptional regulators) has been hypothesized to be {{positively correlated with}} increasing morphological complexity and paleopolyploidizations, especially within the plant kingdom. Here, we present the most comprehensive set of classification rules for TAPs and its application for genome-wide analyses of plants and algae. Using a dated species tree and phylogenetic comparative (PC) analyses, we define the timeline of <b>TAP</b> <b>loss,</b> gain, and expansion among Viridiplantae and find that two major bursts of gain/expansion occurred, coinciding with the water-to-land transition and the radiation of flowering plants. For the first time, we provide PC proof for the long-standing hypothesis that TAPs are major driving forces behind the evolution of morphological complexity, the latter in Plantae being shaped significantly by polyploidization and subsequent biased paleolog retention. Principal component analysis incorporating the number of TAPs per genome provides an alternate and significant proxy for complexity, ideally suited for PC genomics. Our work lays the ground for further interrogation of the shaping of gene regulatory networks underlying the evolution of organism complexity...|$|R

40|$|Tumours evade immune {{recognition}} and destruction through loss or down-regulation of expression of antigen processing and antigen-presenting molecules {{such as the}} human leucocyte antigen (HLA class I) and transporter for antigen presentation (TAP). This study examined the expression of HLA class I, class II and TAP in human pancreatic carcinoma tissue and 19 immortalized pancreatic cancer lines using a panel of antibodies directed against allele-specific as well as monomorphic determinants of these molecules. In tissue samples, reduction or loss of HLA class I and TAP was observed in 76 % of cases, loss or down-regulation of TAP expression in 53 %. In pancreatic cell lines down-regulation or loss of class I and TAP expression was also observed frequently. However, reductions in class I and TAP expression were reversible upon exposure to interferon-γin vitro, suggesting a regulatory rather than structural defect in these genes. De novo class II expression was observed in 26 % of tumours and 42 % of cell lines and may reflect the differentiation status of the cells. The high rate of class I and <b>TAP</b> <b>loss</b> has implications for immunotherapy strategies for pancreatic cancer, as such changes could facilitate a selective growth advantage for malignant cells. However, the reinduction of expression of these molecules with cytokines such as interferon-γ may ultimately allow their cytotoxic T cell-mediated destruction...|$|R
40|$|Viscosity {{is one of}} the {{important}} physiochemical properties of metallurgical slags which is important for slag <b>tapping,</b> metal <b>loss</b> in slag, freeze lining and fluid dynamics. High temperature viscosity measurements are time- and cost-consuming and the number of experiments is limited. Viscosity model is an effective way to predict the viscosities of the complex slags at high temperature. However, a reliable viscosity model can only be developed on the base of accurate experimental data. A unique high-temperature viscosity measurement apparatus developed at The University of Queensland enabled accurate viscosity data to be measured for the "FeO"-SiO-CaO-MgO-AlO system in equilibrium with Fe. An accurate viscosity model has been developed based on Eyring 2 ̆ 7 s theory and extensive viscosity measurements. The viscosities of copper smelting, converting and cleaning slags over a wide range of compositions and temperatures can be predicted and applied in the process control...|$|R
40|$|The {{amino acid}} Glutamine is {{converted}} into Glutamate by a deamidation reaction catalyzed by the enzyme Glutaminase (GLS). Two isoforms of this enzyme have been described, and the GLS 2 isoform is {{regulated by the}} tumor suppressor gene p 53. Here, we show that the p 53 family member TAp 73 also drives the expression of GLS 2. Specifically, we demonstrate that TAp 73 regulates GLS 2 during retinoic acid-induced terminal neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma cells, and overexpression or inhibition of GLS 2 modulates neuronal differentiation and intracellular levels of ATP. Moreover, inhibition of GLS activity, by removing Glutamine from the growth medium, impairs in vitro differentiation of cortical neurons. Finally, expression of GLS 2 increases during mouse cerebellar development. Although, p 73 is dispensable for the in vivo expression of GLS 2, <b>TAp</b> 73 <b>loss</b> affects GABA and Glutamate levels in cortical neurons. Together, these findings suggest a role for GLS 2 acting, at least in part, downstream of p 73 in neuronal differentiation and highlight a possible role of p 73 in regulating neurotransmitter synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{information}} technologies have revolutionized {{how we can}} study risk taking. I leverage datasets produced by three of these technologies to investigate the mitigation of risk associated with obesity, saving for retirement, and smoking. First, I investigate how smartphone notifications, namely those sent by wearable activity trackers and associated mobile "apps," can mitigate risks associated with unhealthy living. The notifications suggest temporary, modestly ambitious goals to randomly treated users. They frame not meeting the temporary goal as a <b>loss,</b> <b>tapping</b> into <b>loss</b> aversion, and thereby promoting physical activity in the short-term (on the order of 0. 10 more miles of walking for 2 / 3 step interventions) and reported sleep in the medium-term (on {{the order of a}} few more minutes for the sole sleep intervention). Second, I focus on mitigating risks associated with Americans saving inadequately or incorrectly for retirement. Framing biases permeate measurements of risk preferences, clouding what to assume in constructing portfolios and default policy rules, and potentially causing large welfare losses. We develop an adaptive surveying procedure to parse framing biases from measures of risk aversion by allowing subjects to reason through inconsistencies among differently framed (but axiomatically equivalent) hypothetical retirement savings plans. The procedure induces an overall reduction in decision errors and an increase in consistency across frames. It also engenders mild convergence in population estimates of mean risk aversion among frames, suggesting resultant "reasoned" preferences better represent true, underlying preferences. Third, using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), I explore whether genetic predisposition can mitigate the extent to which people response to changes in cigarette excise taxes. I focus on two sorts of genetic predisposition, namely to high daily cigarette consumption and high educational attainment. I construct these predisposition measures, or polygenic scores, by performing out-of-sample prediction on the HRS using effect size estimates associated with millions of genetic markers from past, large genome-wide association studies (which exclude HRS). Both polygenic scores are predictive of smoking status and cigarettes per day. However, along both consumption margins and with respect to either polygenic score, I find no evidence of heterogeneity in responsiveness to cigarette excise taxes...|$|R

40|$|The role {{of various}} p 73 isoforms in {{tumorigenesis}} has been controversial. However, {{as we have}} recently shown, the generation of TAp 73 -deficient (TAp 73 (-/-)) mice reveals that TAp 73 isoforms exert tumor-suppressive functions, indicating an emerging role for Trp- 73 in the maintenance of genomic stability. Unlike mice lacking all p 73 isoforms, TAp 73 (-/-) mice show {{a high incidence of}} spontaneous tumors. Moreover, TAp 73 (-/-) mice are infertile and produce oocytes exhibiting spindle abnormalities. These data suggest a link between TAp 73 activities and the common molecular machinery underlying meiosis and mitosis. Previous studies have indicated that the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) complex, whose activation leads to mitotic arrest, also regulates meiosis. In this study, we demonstrate in murine and human cells that TAp 73 is able to interact directly with several partners of the SAC complex (Bub 1, Bub 3, and BubR 1). We also show that TAp 73 is involved in SAC protein localization and activities. Moreover, we show that decreased TAp 73 expression correlates with increases of SAC protein expression in patients with lung cancer. Our results establish TAp 73 as a regulator of SAC responses and indicate that <b>TAp</b> 73 <b>loss</b> can lead to mitotic arrest defects. Our data suggest that SAC impairment in the absence of functional TAp 73 could explain the genomic instability and increased aneuploidy observed in TAp 73 -deficient cells...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Parallel {{operation}} of power transformers {{is a common}} practice. Interest is placed on minimizing the reactive current circulation between transformers due to mismatching of electrical properties. Several control schemes have been applied {{over the years to}} ensure efficient {{operation of}} paralleled transformers with OLTC. These methods rely either on field measurements of circulating currents or on classic Master/Follower approach and usually assume that the paralleled transformers have matching impedances and OLTC positions. On the present work a generalized approach is implemented calculating the circulating current and minimizing losses directly at the System Operation Office and using the distribution system SCADA to control tap position of the paralleled transformers. This permits the determination of optimal tap matching between transformers and calculation of losses under emergency situations where coupling of transformers with slight impedance mismatch might be considered. In the proposed method a map of circulating current is calculated based on the transformer impedance, X/R ratio and OLTC positions, then the optimal <b>tap</b> positions (minimizing <b>losses)</b> under parallel operation are determined. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{induction}} {{characteristics of}} sevoflurane in nitrous oxide and oxygen {{were compared with}} sevoflurane in oxygen alone and a propofol infusion. A vital capacity technique {{was used for the}} gaseous induction groups using a Mapleson A system and a 4 -litre reservoir bag. Four end-points of anaesthesia were recorded: time to cessation of finger <b>tapping,</b> time to <b>loss</b> of eyelash reflex, time to jaw relaxation and time to regular settled breathing after laryngeal mask airway insertion. We also recorded sequential blood pressure and pulse rate, the incidence of adverse airway events and the acceptability of the induction technique. Propofol had a faster time to cessation of finger tapping (p < 0. 05) and jaw relaxation (p < 0. 01). These differences disappeared with the final induction stage and sevoflurane in nitrous oxide and oxygen had the faster time to regular settled breathing, though this did not reach statistical significance. Cardiovascular stability was good and comparable in all groups. There were few adverse airway events in any group and none caused oxygen saturation to fall below 96 %. There was more excitation in the gaseous induction groups, though this did not interfere with induction. Patient satisfaction with induction was high...|$|R
40|$|Oligosaccharides {{from several}} types of raw and {{processed}} legume seeds consumed in Spain, e. g. lentils (Lens culinaris L.), chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.), red kidney beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), white common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), “Judiones de la Granja” great white beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and faba beans (Vicia faba L.), were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography. The total sugar content ranged from 6. 69 % to 9. 99 %, and oligosaccharides represented 25 – 46 % of the total sugar, in the various dry legumes. The main oligosaccharide in raw faba beans was verbascose (3. 32 %), and stachyose in the remaining legumes (2. 21 – 3. 23 %). Different amounts of sucrose and traces of glucose, fructose and small amounts of inulin were present in raw samples of all the legumes. After soaking in <b>tap</b> water the <b>loss</b> of oligosaccharides was lowest in red beans (1. 25 %) and highest in common white beans (27. 6 %). Pressure cooking, without previous soaking, resulted in no oligosaccharide loss in common white beans but a loss of up to 32 % in chickpeas. After pressure cooking of soaked legumes, the loss of stachyose ranged from 14. 2 % in red beans up to 35. 9 % for lentils. Substantial amounts of flatus-producing factors can be eliminated by common processing methods. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to develop and {{validate}} an instrument designed to assess older adolescents 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of certain types of loss following the death of someone they knew. Study One piloted a measure to determine whether the proposed types of loss existed in an older adolescent population and if they could be reliably measured. Exploratory factor analysis found that 11 of the 15 proposed types of loss clustered on to two larger factors which were named Loss of Relationship and Loss of Worldview. Study Two aimed to refine the measure, test through confirmatory factor analysis whether the same factor structure fit data from a new sample, to demonstrate the temporal stability of the measure, and to provide evidence of instrument validity. Study Two demonstrated that a shorter version of the instrument could still reliably <b>tap</b> perceptions of <b>loss</b> and that these perceptions were relatively stable over a two-to-three week period. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the proposed model fit the data, but so did a competing model. Validity assessments showed that while the Types of Loss Questionnaire (TLQ) shared a good deal of variance with other measures of emotional grief reactions, it still makes sense to conceptually distinguish cognitive and emotional responses. The predicted patterns of associations with other variables were not always found. This may be due to the fact that many of the predictions came from the literature on emotional grieving rather than cognitive grieving. Implications, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{report will}} show the energy usage of Hotel Princess in Sandviken, Sweden. When the hotel changed owner an {{examination}} of the hotels heating, ventilation and sanitary systems were done. The report showed flaws in the ventilation system, and is why the new owner wanted {{a closer look at the}} energy use of the hotel.   The original building was built in the 1930 s and two major extensions have been built, one in the 1950 s and the most recent in the 1980 s. An assumption made is that the building parts were built to the restrictions during the time. Activities on the hotel include sleep over, conference, night club, massage and swimming in the hotels pool section. District heating is the primary source of heat and is produced at the CHP-plant in Sandviken.   When investigating the energy use of a building, an energy balance is constructed.   In an energy balance the energy added is equal to the total energy losses. The added energy consists of bought energy (district heat) and “free” energy (heat from humans, electric apparatus, solar energy and lights). The losses include unwanted ventilation, transmission, ventilation, and <b>tap</b> water <b>losses.</b> Calculations have been done with help of collected statistics, measurements and conversations with the hotel staff.   The result shows that the total energy use is more than 1   400 MWh every year.   About half of the energy losses come from transmission through the building construction. Almost one fourth of the energy losses come from the ventilation system, just above 10 % from tap water and about 13 % from unwanted ventilation. To heat the building and hot water, about 4 / 5 district heat and 1 / 5 “free” energy is used.   Investigating the ventilation system revealed problems, the largest being that several ventilation units were out of function and some showed large differences between supply and exhaust air. Installing a ventilation system with variable air volume (VAV) could lower the energy demand to heat ventilation air by roughly 73 %, equal to about 140   000 kr every year. A new ventilation system is a large investment, however, and it is not likely be a profitable investment within a 15 -year period.   Further work could be: Investigate the ventilation units that are out of function, especially the pool ventilation unit. If necessary, check what the price of a new ventilation system would be. Update the drawings of the current ventilation system, if it is going to be used in the future...|$|R
30|$|Phloem turgor {{pressure}} regulation {{has not been}} extensively studied. The negative relationship of phloem {{turgor pressure}} with leaf water deficit of H. brasiliensis (Buttery and Boatman 1964; 1966), and F. americana (Susan et al. 1981) suggests the water transport to the phloem laticifer vessels is directly responsible for phloem turgor pressure. Similarly, in the tapping induced latex flow course, the recovery of phloem turgor pressure could be also partially ascribed to the influx of water from surrounding tissues. The phloem turgor pressure recorded reflects the balance between fluid loss and fluid gain. In the intact laticifer fluid cytoplasm, the latex, is well equilibrated and under a turgor pressure as high as 10  bar. Upon tapping, the phloem laticifer vessels connected by anastomosis are breached and the turgor pressure of the laticiferous system near the cut will reduce to atmospheric pressure. Immediately, a turgor pressure difference of about 6.9 to 14  bar between the nearby laticiferous vessels and the cut itself will be established (Figures  6 and 7; Additional files 3, 4 and 5) (Buttery and Boatman 1966, 1967) resulting in the latex expulsion. Subsequently, latex coagulation and water influx from surrounding tissues, operating for a long while, will occur leading to a latex flow recession and turgor pressure recovery. When the tree is just <b>tapped,</b> the <b>loss</b> of fluid from the latex outflow is too great to be compensated by water inflow. Hence the turgor pressure drops very immediately after tapping. After a while (normally 8 - 45  min), the latex exudation from the tapping cut receded rapidly due to the gradually plugging of the severed laticifer vessels. When the rate of water inflow into the latex vessels exceeds the rate of latex exudation from the tapping cut, phloem turgor pressure rises. The gradually increase of phloem turgor pressure 8 - 45  min after tapping (Figure  6 and Additional files 3 and 4) is therefore a consequence of laticifer vessel water inflow accompanied by plugging that were well documented (D’Auzac et al. 1989; Frey-Wyssling 1932; Pakianathan et al. 1966; Priyadarshan 2011). The relative higher turgor pressure at 5  cm beneath the tapping cut than that at 25  cm below the tapping cut before the latex flow cease (Figure  7 and Additional file 5) is because that maximum latex dilution occurs {{very close to the}} tapping cut or even at the tapping cut itself (D’Auzac et al. 1989). Therefore, the real time measurement of rubber tree phloem turgor pressure with PTPP could better understand its latex flow and phloem water relationship. The PTPP could probably also extend to investigate the phloem water relationship and turgor pressure regulation of other woody plant trunk.|$|R
40|$|Riksbyggen Fastighetsservice is {{a company}} whose {{businesses}} cope with building construction and related services. The local office of Riksbyggen Fastighetsservice in Gävle has been studied in this project. The local office locates in Näringen 20 : 4, which was constructed in 1989.   The aim of this project {{is to make a}} diagnosis of the current situation; find out the most applicable way of optimizing the operation of the facility {{in order to reduce the}} energy consumption, to study costs and possible savings and provide assistance with future energy management.       Firstly, a study of Energy Balance was conducted. The transmission losses was 57761 KWh; mechanical ventilation losses 3855 KWh; hot <b>tap</b> water heat <b>losses</b> 9579 KWh; natural transmission and infiltration 6897 KWh. On the other hand, heat gain from internal heat was 12707 KWh; solar radiation 8521 KWh; and supply heat 56806 KWh.   Secondly, the energy costs have been checked out. 29655 KWh of electricity was consumed in 2008. 5948 KWh was used by 20 fuses electricity and 23707 KWh was for 25 fuses. Lighting, electrical equipment and machine composed the electricity consumption. Lighting consumes 13278 KWh; equipment consumes 6452 KWh; and machine consumes 9925 KWh. Lighting electricity was composed by office lighting and workshop lighting with 4798 KWh and 8480 KWh respectively.   Electricity cost is very complicated and flexible in Sweden according to effect and consumption. The total cost of electricity consists of electricity commerce fee and electricity transmission net. Electricity commerce fee includes annual fixed fee, electricity fee, energy certificate and tax. Electricity transmission fee includes annual fixed transmission fee, grid fee and tax. Tax plays vital important role which results in huge total cost. The local office spent 43356 kr on electricity in 2008. 4798 kr was spent on office lighting, and 8480 kr was spent on workshop lighting.   On the other hand district heating fee is composed by annual fixed fee, effect fee, energy fee and tax. The local office spent 37142 kr on 56. 806 MWh of district heating in 2008. Thus, the local office purchased 86461 KWh of energies and spent 80498 kr in total in 2008.   Thirdly, to assist its energy traces and management, three tables were designed. One table is for annual energy consumption and cost in each month with all information of sub-terms on costs. One table is for annual electricity consumption for each electrical equipment and cost in accordance. Another table is for district heating consumption and cost.     At last, energy saving possibilities was explored. One way is applying improvements or maintenance of the office construction. The result of Energy Balance shows that transmission losses were 57761 KWh which occupies 74 % of the total losses, and it is the biggest bite. As the office was constructed in 1989, if improvements and maintenance can be applied to the insulation of floor, roof and walls, or change the windows, the heat losses can be reduced.   However, the other solution might be much more applicable and financial sound. Just go to Clas Ohlson to buy LED 1 W and 3 W lamps to replace the current bulbs. Spending 3009 kr to buy 51 LED incandescent bulbs of 1 W effect, and 3576 kr on 24 LED fluorescent of 3 W effect, will save 12057 kr every year. The lighting electricity consumption will be reduced from 13278 KWh / year to 264 KWh / year. Instead of spending 16017 kr on lighting, 98 % will be reduced, and only 318 kr will be paid. Moreover, the payback is really nice, only 0. 42 year. Action! The sooner the better! 20 % of energy cost will be saved...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} master thesis {{project is}} to make an energy survey {{for a group of}} apartments and {{suggestions}} to change the heating system from electricity to a more efficient one. There are in total 73 flats in 21 buildings. All flats are separated in several houses from two to five flats in one building. There are two different kinds of flats. One with three rooms in one floor, in the following referred to as ‘flat A’ and the other one with four rooms in two floors, in the following referred to as ‘flat B’. [1] In the area there are also two buildings for the commonalty. In these buildings there are a shelter and several common rooms like a storage and a laundry. In our work these two buildings are not included because they are used by everyone inside the community and we could not obtain exact values for the used electricity and the water consumption. So our work is specialised only on the residential houses. The first part of this thesis contains the energy balance for the different kinds of flats to see how much energy they consume for heating and hot tap water. To get theses values we have to analyse the total energy flow into one flat and compare it with the energy which is used because of transmission losses, ventilation <b>losses,</b> hot <b>tap</b> water, electricity for the household and natural ventilation and infiltration. The total energy consumption for flat A is about 19000 kWh per year and in flat B about 23200 kWh per year. But the electricity which is used and has to be bought is about 15600 kWh per year in flat A flat and 17600 kWh in flat B. The rest of the energy is from so called free heat caused by solar radiation and internal heat generation. [1] These numbers for the electricity need in one year create annual costs of about 20000 SEK in flat A and 22500 SEK in flat B. To reduce these costs it is necessary to know where this energy goes and for what it is used. The important parts of the energy balance for this thesis are the transmission losses, the losses caused by natural ventilation and infiltration and the used energy for hot <b>tap</b> water. The <b>losses</b> caused by mechanical ventilation have also a significant value, but they would only affect the new heating system if the ventilation system would be connected to the new system. And the electricity used in the household for electrical devices can only be changed by the consumer himself. The part which is affecting the energy costs for the transmission and natural ventilation losses and the hot tap water sums up to 9240 kWh per year in flat A and flat B. This causes costs of about 10000 SEK per year. To reduce these costs it is necessary to change the actual heating system. In the following we analyse the saving potentials with a change to an air-water heat pump or with a connection to the local district heating network. The costs which can be saved with the installation of a heat pump sum up to about 7000 SEK per year. The installation costs are about 100000 SEK to 125000 SEK depending on the different proposed models. If you consider that the existing electrical boiler has to be changed anyway in the next years the investment costs for the combination with a heat pump decreases. The payback time is then between 9 ½ and 13 ½ years. With assumed increasing electricity prices of 5 % each year the payback time decreases to 8 ½ to 11 years. With a connection of each flat to the local district heating network the energy costs for heating and hot tap water decreases to 3200 SEK per year. Although the price per kWh for district heating is much lower than for electricity the costs are not decreasing a lot because of a high annual fixed fee of 7100 SEK. The saved money per year sums up to 300 SEK and 1000 SEK depending on the electricity contract. The payback time for this alternative is between 50 and up to 160 years. An alternative to the exchange of the heating and hot water system is to change the actual heat exchanger of the ventilation system. With this measure the energy consumption can be reduced with less investment costs. The investment costs for a new heat exchanger are about 35000 SEK, including a new exhaust hood from the kitchen outwards to reduce the contamination of the filters in the heat exchanger. [1] The payback time ranges from 13 years in flat A to 21 years in flat B...|$|R
