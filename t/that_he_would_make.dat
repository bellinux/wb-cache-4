5|$|Due to Given's lack {{of playing}} {{time with his}} club Aston Villa, there was {{speculation}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> himself available for selection as part of Ireland's 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign. On 14 January 2013, {{it was announced that}} Given was once again available for international selection.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Sorkin {{reportedly}} {{obtained the}} film rights to Andrew Young's book The Politician (about Senator John Edwards), and announced <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> his debut {{as a film}} director while also adapting the book for the screen.|$|E
5|$|After the nine-month break, del Potro {{confirmed}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> {{his return}} at the 2010 PTT Thailand Open. In his return match, he {{lost in the}} first round to Olivier Rochus. He then also played at the 2010 Rakuten Japan Open Tennis Championships, but again lost in the opening round, this time to Feliciano López.|$|E

5|$|The {{final stage}} of Prus's journey took him to Paris, where he was {{prevented}} by his agoraphobia from crossing the Seine River to visit the city's southern Left Bank. He was nevertheless pleased to find that his descriptions of Paris in The Doll {{had been on the}} mark (he had based them mainly on French-language publications). From Paris he hurried home to recuperate at Nałęczów from his journey, the last <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> abroad.|$|E
5|$|After a full {{pre-season}} {{he started}} to play well and hit six goals in 30 Third Division games during his time at Ashton Gate. Milne's form attracted attention elsewhere with Aberdeen among those interested, a move Milne favoured to be near his son and other family in Scotland. On being called into a meeting with manager, Joe Jordan, Milne was told by Jordan {{that he had no}} intention of letting him nor any of his other best players leave, but <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> an exception for Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|Fernández {{began the}} 2015 {{season on the}} 15-day {{disabled}} list but was later moved to the 60-day disabled list to continue recovery from Tommy John surgery. It was announced by the Marlins on June 15 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> his season debut on July 2. In his debut, Fernández recorded six strikeouts in six innings. He also hit a home run. Fernández returned to the disabled list in August with a biceps strain in his pitching arm. He returned to the mound in September and set a major league record for consecutive wins at home by a single pitcher with his seventeenth such win on the 25th of that month.|$|E
60|$|But, as the Bishop rode away, {{he vowed}} within himself <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{sometime}} <b>make</b> Robin rue the day <b>that</b> <b>he</b> stopped him in Sherwood.|$|R
60|$|Thinking {{the matter}} over he determined, if possible, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> someday <b>make</b> {{his way over}} to Malinche's country, which seemed so far in advance of the Tabascans.|$|R
60|$|I {{understood}} <b>that</b> now <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> {{an experiment}} {{of the plan}} which he had suggested, and as softly as might be I followed his instructions, repeating them to Harvey.|$|R
5|$|In the lead-up to the visit, the American Friends of Vietnam (AFV) {{engaged in}} a promotional {{campaign}} encouraging newspapers to cover Diệm's visit and imploring them to give the South Vietnamese president favourable coverage. The AFV also drafted many of Diệm's speeches, making sure that there were analogies made between South Vietnam and various events in American history, so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> a good impression on the American public and decision-makers. For this purpose they employed the services of the political consultancy firm Harold Oram.|$|E
5|$|Once he was {{sufficiently}} recovered Cragh undertook {{a pilgrimage to}} Hereford, accompanied by Lord and Lady Briouze, to thank Cantilupe for restoring his life. He walked barefoot on the three-day trip, wearing the rope he had been hanged with around his neck. The rope was left at Cantilupe's shrine, after which Cragh said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, although there is some doubt {{as to whether he}} subsequently even left Wales. Jussi Hanska has suggested that Cragh may have invented the pilgrimage story to escape from his companions.|$|E
5|$|By 1988, Searchlight {{reported}} that the party's membership had declined to around 1,000. Tyndall responded by trying to raise finances, calling for greater sales of their newspaper and increasing the price of membership by 50%. He also promised <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> the BNP the largest extreme-right group in the UK {{and that he would}} establish a professional headquarters for the party. This was achieved in 1989, as a party headquarters was opened in Welling, Southeast London, an area chosen because it was a recipient of significant 'white flight' from inner London. That year also witnessed the BNP become the most prominent force on the British far-right as the NF collapsed amid internal arguments and schisms.|$|E
50|$|Notable by {{its absence}} is any firm {{commitment}} to reducing tax. In his {{speech at the}} party conference, Howard said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>make</b> promises <b>he</b> could not keep.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 Navid Saberi, {{president}} of United Gulf, said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> likely <b>make</b> another proposal to City Hall within {{the following year}} to 18 months. However, he never did so.|$|R
50|$|In Oran, {{he founded}} a small music school with 17 musicians, and {{conducted}} an orchestra, but <b>he</b> soon felt <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>make</b> any progress unless {{he went to}} Paris.|$|R
5|$|De Grasse {{arrived at}} Cap-Français on 15 August. He {{immediately}} dispatched {{his response to}} Rochambeau's note, which was <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> for the Chesapeake. Taking on 3,200 troops, De Grasse sailed from Cap-Français with his entire fleet, 28 ships of the line. Sailing outside the normal shipping lanes to avoid notice, {{he arrived at the}} mouth of Chesapeake Bay on August 30, and disembarked the troops to assist in the land blockade of Cornwallis. Two British frigates that were supposed to be on patrol outside the bay were trapped inside the bay by de Grasse's arrival; this prevented the British in New York from learning the full strength of de Grasse's fleet until it was too late.|$|E
5|$|Dickov {{opted to}} build a {{youthful}} side and made controversial decisions {{at the start of}} the season to offload 2009–10 player of the year and club captain Sean Gregan as well as top scorer Paweł Abbott amongst other first team players. The team went into the New Year in ninth position, with games in hand on the teams above them, and being unbeaten at home in the league. Results in the second half of the season were less consistent and the team finished the season in the bottom half of the table. On 6 May 2011 Dickov announced <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> only his second appearance of the season for the first team in the final match of the season, and would then end his playing career to concentrate on management. He then came on as a 77th-minute substitute the following day against Milton Keynes Dons.|$|E
5|$|Following Jones' rejection, Garrard vetoed a {{bill that}} would have allowed the {{legislature}} to select the state's presidential and vice-presidential electors; despite the fact that the law ran contrary to the state constitution, Garrard's veto further strained his relations with the Senate. After the Senate rejected nominee William Trigg, the state's newspapers openly talked of an executive-legislative feud and claimed the Senate had its own favorite candidate for the position and would not accept anyone else. When the Senate rejected Willis Green in January 1804, Garrard declared <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> no more nominations for the position. Accusations of bad faith were exchanged between the governor and the Senate, after which Garrard nominated John Adair, the popular Speaker of the House. The Senate finally confirmed this choice.|$|E

5|$|In 444 BC, the {{conservative}} {{and the democratic}} factions confronted {{each other in a}} fierce struggle. The ambitious new leader of {{the conservative}}s, Thucydides (not {{to be confused with the}} historian of the same name), accused Pericles of profligacy, criticizing the way he spent the money for the ongoing building plan. Thucydides initially managed to incite the passions of the ecclesia regarding these charges in his favor. However, when Pericles took the floor, his resolute arguments put Thucydides and the conservatives firmly on the defensive. Finally, Pericles proposed to reimburse the city for all questionable expenses from his private property, with the proviso <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> the inscriptions of dedication in his own name. His stance was greeted with applause, and Thucydides was soundly, if unexpectedly, defeated. In 442BC, the Athenian public voted to ostracize Thucydides from the city for 10 years and Pericles was once again the unchallenged ruler of the Athenian political arena.|$|E
5|$|Neetu Chandra, {{who worked}} with Kumar on Yavarum Nalam (2009), made a cameo {{appearance}} in the film. Nagarjuna's sister Supriya told the media that a few other actors also made cameo appearances in the film. Rashi Khanna confirmed in early April 2014 that she too would make such an appearance. Kumar convinced Nagarjuna to let Akhil make a cameo appearance {{towards the end of}} the film or in a special song. However an official confirmation was originally unavailable. Amitabh Bachchan posted in his official blogging site on 27 April 2014 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> a quick cameo appearance in the film which would be his debut in Telugu cinema. Lavanya Tripathi also made a cameo appearance on Kumar's request. Akhil made a cameo towards the film's end, as he did not want to miss a chance of sharing the screen with his grandfather.|$|E
5|$|On October 7, 1908, Edith Berg, {{the wife}} of the brothers' European {{business}} agent, became the first American woman passenger when she flew with Wilbur—one of many passengers who rode with him that autumn. Wilbur also became acquainted with Léon Bollée and his family. Bollée was the owner of an automobile factory where Wilbur would assemble the Flyer and where he would be provided with hired assistance. Bollée would fly that autumn with Wilbur. Madame Bollée had been in the latter stages of pregnancy when Wilbur arrived in LeMans in June 1908 to assemble the Flyer. Wilbur promised her <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> his first European flight the day her baby was born which he did, August 8, 1908.|$|E

5|$|Surya shifts his {{attention}} towards the upcoming Indian parliament elections and meets Guru Govind Patel, {{the head of}} the opposition party through Laalu. He makes a deal with him, offering 350 billion for election campaigning and also promises him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> him the prime minister of India. Surya spends millions on every constituency in India, making Jai Dev unable to contest in the elections by revealing his illegal affairs. Jai Dev kidnaps Chitra to seek revenge on Surya, who fights with Jai Dev's henchmen. He is injured, but eventually kills Jai Dev, saving Chitra and proposing to her for the last time. It is revealed at the end that Surya successfully installed Guru Govind Patel as the Prime Minister of India.|$|E
5|$|As a teenager, Southall had {{unsuccessful}} trials at Wrexham, Crewe Alexandra and Bolton Wanderers. He {{aspired to}} be a postman, and never believed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> a living playing football. He then worked as a binman, waiter and hod carrier and therefore entered the game relatively late. He played for Llandudno Town at age 15, before joining Northern Premier League side Bangor City on £10 a week as a semi-professional the following year. Bangor manager Dave Elliott regularly selected veteran goalkeeper Peter Eales ahead of Southall. Everton asked Elliot permission to take Southall on trial, but Elliot left the club shortly after and no trial took place. With Bangor in financial trouble the paid playing staff began to leave the club, and Southall left Bangor {{and went on to}} accept an offer of £3 a week to play for Conwy United. He moved on to Cheshire County League club Winsford United at the age of 20. The club won the Cheshire Senior Cup in 1980, and Southall was voted the club's Player of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Drogba came on as a {{substitute}} for Anelka against Manchester United in the Community Shield, but could not help prevent Chelsea from succumbing to a 3–1 loss. However, he started the Premier League season in fine form, continuing from where he left off {{on the last day of}} the previous campaign as he scored a hat-trick against West Bromwich Albion in a 6–0 victory. In Chelsea's next game against Wigan Athletic at the DW Stadium, Drogba made three assists in another 6–0 win. Drogba also played the next game at home against Stoke City where he played the whole 90 minutes and scored his fourth Premier League goal of the season when he kicked home a penalty after Nicolas Anelka was brought down by Thomas Sørensen inside the box. On 7 November 2010, Drogba missed the first half of Chelsea's 2–0 defeat by Liverpool. It was later revealed that he had been suffering from malaria for at least a month. He had first complained of feeling unwell before the October 2010 international break but the illness was only diagnosed on 8 November 2010. Having diagnosed the problem, Chelsea insisted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> a full recovery within days.|$|E
