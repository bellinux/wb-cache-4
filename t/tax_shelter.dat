40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the links between}} corporate tax avoidance, the growth of highpowered incentives for managers, {{and the structure of}} corporate governance. We develop and test a simple model that highlights the role of complementarities between <b>tax</b> <b>sheltering</b> and managerial diversion in determining how high-powered incentives influence <b>tax</b> <b>sheltering</b> decisions. The model generates the testable hypothesis that firm governance characteristics determine how incentive compensation changes sheltering decisions. In order to test the model, we construct an empirical measure of corporate tax avoidance - the component of the book-tax gap not attributable to accounting accruals - and investigate the link between this measure of tax avoidance and incentive compensation. We find that, for the full sample of firms, increases in incentive compensation tend to reduce the level of <b>tax</b> <b>sheltering,</b> suggesting a complementary relationship between diversion and sheltering. As predicted by the model, the relationship between incentive compensation and <b>tax</b> <b>sheltering</b> is a function of a firm. s corporate governance. Our results may help explain the growing cross-sectional variation among firms in their levels of tax avoidance, the. undersheltering puzzle,. and why large book-tax gaps are associated with subsequent negative abnormal returns.

40|$|The precipitous {{decline in}} <b>tax</b> <b>sheltered</b> {{investments}} after the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA) is widely {{attributed to the}} passive loss rules. These rules disallowed losses from activities in which the taxpayer did not materially participate as a current deduction against all sources of income except for other passive activities. This paper demonstrates instead {{that the role of}} the passive loss limitations was secondary to that of other reforms enacted by TRA, most importantly the repeal of the investment tax credit and the long-term capital gain exclusion. These other reforms not only lowered after-tax rates of return on <b>tax</b> <b>sheltered</b> investments but also eliminated the positive correlation between the investor's marginal tax rate and the investment's after-tax rate of return. As a result, high income taxpayers ceased to be the natural clientele for legitimate <b>tax</b> <b>shelters</b> after TRA. The passive loss rules were more effective in curtailing the use of 'abusive' tax shelters; however, it is shown that a more narrowly focused restriction on seller financing of <b>tax</b> <b>sheltered</b> investments could have accomplished the same goal with much less scope for discouraging productive economic investments. ...|$|R
