40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} market micro-structure <b>and</b> communication in <b>takeovers</b> that involve shareholders' investment decisions and {{the selection of a}} takeover mechanism by a raider under asymmetric information. For this purpose, rational expectations equilibrium models are employed and examples are worked in detail. In the context of market micro-structure, it is shown that there is a greater probability of success of a takeover when the shareholders are risk averse that when they are risk neutral, and the probability that a takeover succeeds is related non-positively to the fraction of shares held by the raider. In order to study communication, two takeover mechanisms are studied which are <b>tender</b> offers <b>and</b> negotiated <b>takeovers.</b> A negotiated takeover allows for communication between the shareholders and the raider before any takeover announcement. It is shown that communication offsets partially the negative impact of risk aversion on the probability that a hostile takeover occurs...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} largely {{prompted}} by the two recently promulgated regulations governing takeovers in China. The goal {{of this article is}} to critically examine the legal takeover regime in China and to put forward proposals for reform. To outline the discussion, Part II describes the stock market, the <b>takeover</b> law, <b>and</b> the <b>takeover</b> activities in China. Two legislative goals, namely contestability of <b>takeovers</b> <b>and</b> shareholder protection, are set out in Part III. Under these principles, Part IV and Part V explore the issues of <b>tender</b> offer <b>and</b> anti <b>takeover</b> defenses, respectively. Specifically, Part IV focuses on information disclosure and other major rules relating to takeovers. It appears that these rules are in line with the international norm and acceptably workable in the context of China. Furthermore, Part V explores the serious problems that are associated with anti-takeover defenses. China's law seems to be both over inclusive and under inclusive in this respect. After an in depth comparative analysis of the legal regimes in the U. S., UK, and Australia, it is apparent that those regimes are not suitable for China's local conditions. Lastly, this article proposes a regime in which shareholders could veto the use of takeover defenses ex post, while requiring that certain defensive measures be decided ex ante. This proposal could well suit China's needs because it not only gives shareholders sufficient protection, but also preserves necessary flexibility for management to efficiently respond to truly undesirable tender offers...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} examines <b>takeovers</b> <b>and</b> horizontal mergers, {{considering whether}} or not current policy seems appropriate. Focus lies on both predicted and actual market performance effects. Horizontal mergers are investigated in a product market context <b>and</b> <b>takeovers</b> in an asset market environment. Horizontal mergers. The horizontal merger research {{is concerned with the}} relationship of industry concentration and anticompetitive market outcomes. Historically, economists treat concentration and competitive performance as inversely related, and the Department of Justice Merger Guidelines (DOJMG) continue {{to do so in the}} screening of mergers to be challenged. Laboratory analysis allows for direct control of variables such as market definition, scale economies, barriers to entry and concentration, thus permitting tests of the potential tradeoff of anticompetitive outcomes and production efficiency due to merger. The experimental design takes both the DOJMG and economic theory into account. When the merged firm enjoys economies of scale, the merger is observed to have a significant impact on industry performance, namely in the competitive direction. The data suggest that if the antitrust authorities rely on the Herfindahl-Hirshman Index (HHI) as measured by sales as opposed to capacity they inappropriately increase the number of cases to be challenged. It remains to be seen {{whether or not}} a more useful predictor of the anticompetitive effects of mergers exists. The data indicate that the HHI based on capacity accompanied by an alteration of the policy demarcation line would improve measurement of the effect. Takeovers. The takeover study focuses on two buyout policies, the <b>tender</b> offer <b>and</b> market <b>takeover.</b> The latter policy represents a prohibition of tender offers, but with acquisition attempts permitted via the asset market. Investment and operating skills of management are controlled for by holding profitability of the target firm constant. Laboratory analysis incorporates treatments of certain versus uncertain dividend values. Results suggest that shareholder value added (SVA) is greater when an acquisition is attempted than in its absence, regardless of takeover method or its success. SVA associated with the <b>tender</b> offer <b>and</b> market treatments do not vary significantly under both the uncertain and certain dividend value treatments...|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the extent to}} which UK company law <b>and</b> <b>takeover</b> regulation {{may have contributed to the}} supposed short-termism exercised by target directors in takeovers, that is, target directors focusing only on short-term financial gain to the current shareholders, rather than the target’s long-term wealth creation or the interests of other stakeholders. This article argues that general company law <b>and</b> <b>takeover</b> regulation do not mandate target directors to strictly prioritise the short-term financial interests of the company. While company law <b>and</b> <b>takeover</b> regulation require the target board to consider stakeholders’ interests, neither shareholders nor stakeholders have an enforceable right of action against the directors in connection with their failure to do so. This article suggests a partial solution to resolve the enforcement issue in relation to schemes of arrangement, while preserving the existing shareholder-centric model, and addresses the question of whether there is a need for a fundamental overhaul of company law <b>and</b> <b>takeover</b> regulation...|$|R
