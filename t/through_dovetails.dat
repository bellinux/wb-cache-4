50|$|Half-blind {{dovetails}} {{are commonly}} used to fasten drawer fronts to drawer sides. This is {{an alternative to the}} practice of attaching false fronts to drawers constructed using <b>through</b> <b>dovetails.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{photograph}} {{at the top}} of {{this page}} shows a through dovetail (also known as plain dovetail) joint, where the end grain of both boards is visible when the joint is assembled. <b>Through</b> <b>dovetails</b> are common in carcass and box construction. Traditionally, the dovetails would have often been covered by a veneer. However, dovetails have become a signature of craftsmanship and are generally considered a feature, so they are rarely concealed in contemporary work. When used in drawer construction, a through (or blind, mitred, or lapped) dovetail joint is sometimes referred to as an [...] "English dovetail." ...|$|E
5000|$|Despite local {{protection}} and quite widespread {{awareness of the}} giant catfish and its critically endangered status, the species is gravely threatened by the build-out of hydroelectric dams on the Mekong River and its tributaries, and by fishing. Though the species is being propagated in Thailand, Thai stock {{is reported to be}} contaminated by hybridization with P. hypophthalmus, with hybrids having been carelessly released into the wild. Cambodia currently offers the best opportunities for conservation intervention <b>through</b> <b>dovetailed</b> efforts in captive propagation, reintroduction, and habitat protection.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of {{the paper is the}} parametrization and the finite element analysis of mechanical pro­per­ties of a <b>through</b> <b>dovetail</b> joint made {{with the use of a}} specific procedure by a 3 -axis CNC machine. This corner joint was used for the simulation of the bending load of the joint in the angle plane – by compression, i. e. by pressing the joint together. The deformation fields, the stress distribution, the stiffness and the bending moment of the joints were evaluated. The finite element system ANSYS was used to create two parametric numerical models of the joint. The first one represents an ideal­ly stiff joint – both joint parts have been glued together. The second model includes the contact between the joined parts. This numerical model was used to monitor the response of the joint stiffness to the change of the static friction coefficient. The results of both models were compared both with each other and with similar analyses conducted within the research into ready-to-assemble furniture joints. The results can be employed in the designing of more complex furniture products with higher demands concerning stiffness characteristics, such as furniture for sitting. However, this assumption depends on the correction of the created parametric models by experimental testing...|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, {{women would}} gain {{opportunities}} for entrance into ROTC programs, as the Army opened up positions in Field Artillery and the Ordinance Corps to female officers. Women {{coming into the}} Army <b>through</b> ROTC <b>dovetailed</b> with {{the elimination of the}} Women's Army Corps. The Gator Guard, having been an exclusively male team, would also see the entrance of female members in the coveted position of drillers, who would march and execute precision drill movements in parade as part of the team. The first female cadet to march with the drill team was during the 1973-1974 school year was Carmen Parrot. She was allowed to carry the Guidon during parades. The first female commander of the drill team would be Nancy A. Oxer in 1979. The first female GGDT member to be commissioned was Bonnie Chandler.|$|R
6000|$|We {{have said}} that {{everything}} in the lighthouse was substantial and very strong. All the woodwork was oak, the floors and walls of solid stone,--hence, when Dove, who had no nerves or physical feelings, proceeded with his cooking, the noise he caused was tremendous. A man used to woman's gentle ways would, on seeing him poke the fire, have expected that the poker would certainly penetrate not only the coals, but {{the back of the}} grate also, and perchance make its appearance at the outside of the building itself, <b>through</b> stones, joggles, <b>dovetails,</b> trenails, pozzolano mortar, and all the strong materials that have withstood the fury of winds and waves for the last half-century! ...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} {{leadership}} development in academic libraries is recent {{area of interest}} for the profession. There is nascent scholarship {{in the areas of}} how to prepare librarians to advance into a first formal management position {{as well as in the}} area of leadership capacity-building for librarians and library organizations. This poster combines two independent research projects with the common theme of leadership development in academic libraries. It is not often that separate scholarship integrates effectively and cogently, but these studies coalesced in such an impactful way that all parties felt the need to share the content as well as the process with other scholars. One of the most important aspects of the collaboration was ensuring each researcher 2 ̆ 7 s voice was honored so the audience had clarity about each individual’s efforts as well as an understanding of how the studies’ findings <b>dovetail.</b> <b>Through</b> multiple conversations during the poster creation process, it emerged that both studies revealed the need for libraries to better address first-level management potential and leadership development at the individual, organizational, and professional levels. This poster session outlines the processes and outcomes of both studies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe ITTF’s mentions, in June 2007, on the VOC-free glue using rules, {{have been}} refined, in 1 Jan. 2009, up to higher {{standards}} {{due to the}} human health protection. Because of these reasons, the latest research focuses the processing of the table tennis rackets by materials and technologies that reduce or totally eliminate the using of glues. The processing of a sandwich composite plate based on Al alloy foam and rubber coating processed by injection moulding on the metallic foam provide the possibility to attach it to the wooden support of the tennis table racket by a mechanical route <b>through</b> the <b>dovetail</b> system. Thus, glues using is eliminated. The powder metallurgy (PM) technology {{has been used in}} order to process Al-based foams from Al alloys powder particles and NaCl granules. Powder particles of aluminum alloy of 200  μm average size, at 40 % (wt.) content, are homogenized with NaCl granules for 3  mm and 4  mm, at 60 % (wt.) content, followed by cold compaction at 500  MPa, sintering in argon atmosphere and ultrasonic washing. Thus, metallic foams are processed, having different properties depending on the NaCl granules sizes. For 3  mm NaCl granules, the metallic foams have the following characteristics: density (0. 2 … 0. 35)  g/cm 3, porosity (60 … 70) %, average diameter of the pores 2. 15  mm. For 4  mm NaCl granules, the metallic foams have the following characteristics: density (0. 15 … 0. 25)  g/cm 3, porosity (65 … 75) %, average diameter of the pores 2. 65  mm. The mixture of rubber and carbon black is deposited on the metallic foam surface by injection moulding process, developed at the injection pressure of 50 bar, temperature of (130 … 150) ∘C. The injected rubber coating has the density of (0. 9 – 1. 4)  g/cm 3, the Shore hardness of (40 … 80) and (1 … 4)  mm thickness. The results of this research provide the following advantages: elimination of the glues {{as well as of the}} multiple gluing of the same rubber coating because of the injection moulding technique of the rubber on the foam; conservation of the tennis table racket weight because the metallic foam has a low density (0. 15 … 0. 35  g/cm 3) and consequently a low mass (20 … 50  g) for a plate of 15  mm diameter and 1  mm thickness, including the dovetail system that allows the quick replacement of the covering...|$|R
