2500|$|The Main Base {{public address}} system, {{known as the}} [...] "giant voice", first {{conceived}} in 1946 and installed by the communications maintenance division of the Mobile, Alabama Air Material Area, went into operation in February 1950 with preliminary testing completed by 15 February. [...] "The new PA system, situated in the Johnson Hall information booth, resembles an instrument panel from some Buck Roger's [...] space ship. Two record turn tables are available for the transmission of transcribed bugle calls, and appropriate music. A <b>telephone</b> <b>extension</b> running to the commanding general's office will enable him to make special addresses to Eglin personnal [...] The third method of transmitting announcements and emergency bulletins is the microphone connection to the control console. Four amplifier speakers are located in clusters {{at each of the}} seven sites. Designed to saturate the area, the speakers are installed at the radio base maintenance shop, guided missiles headquarters, headquarters air proving ground, the motor pool area, the maintenance and supply area, the boat squadron area, in the Plew Heights housing area, and a direct connection to the station hospital's public address system." [...] The system is now used to broadcast lightning warnings after an airman was struck while out on a ramp and killed.|$|E

50|$|DSL signals may be {{degraded}} {{by older}} telephone lines, surge protectors, poorly designed microfilters, Repetitive Electrical Impulse Noise, and by long <b>telephone</b> <b>extension</b> cords. <b>Telephone</b> <b>extension</b> cords are typically made with small-gauge, multi-strand copper conductors {{which do not}} maintain a noise-reducing pair twist. Such cable is more susceptible to electromagnetic interference and has more attenuation than solid twisted-pair copper wires typically wired to telephone jacks. These effects are especially significant where the customer's phone line is more than 4 km from the DSLAM in the telephone exchange, which causes the signal levels to be lower relative to any local noise and attenuation. This will {{have the effect of}} reducing speeds or causing connection failures.|$|E
50|$|The systems all {{had both}} voice and data {{functions}} - the marketplace largely bought {{them for their}} then-new voice and management functions. Early-1960s computers had hardly any typewriter-like terminals and no screens - the IBM Switching Systems introduced the novelty of simple digital-data capture from every touch-tone <b>telephone</b> <b>extension.</b>|$|E
50|$|A ring {{generator}} or ringing voltage generator is a device which outputs 20 cycle sinusoidal AC {{at up to}} 90 volts peak to power bells or annunciators {{in one or more}} <b>telephone</b> <b>extensions.</b> The output stops if a handset is taken off the hook.|$|R
50|$|The story {{prompted}} a large-scale {{investigation into the}} possible source inside the Australian Public Service including Australian Federal Police probing 3,000 <b>telephone</b> <b>extensions</b> and hundreds of mobile phones. However, McManus and Harvey refused to disclose to the Australian Federal Police their source, citing adherence to journalists “Code of Ethics”.|$|R
50|$|A PBX (Private Branch Exchange) is {{a system}} that connects <b>telephone</b> <b>extensions</b> to the Public Switched Telephone Network and {{provides}} internal communication for a business. An IP PBX is a PBX with Internet Protocol connectivity and may provide additional audio, video, or instant messaging communication utilizing the TCP/IP protocol stack.|$|R
50|$|Plugs {{are used}} to {{terminate}} loose cables and cords, while jacks are used for fixed locations on surfaces such as walls and panels, and on equipment. Other than <b>telephone</b> <b>extension</b> cables, cables with a modular plug on one end and a jack on the other are rare. Instead, cables are connected using a male-to-male adapter, which consists of two female jacks wired back-to-back.|$|E
50|$|The SIP URI {{scheme is}} a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) {{multimedia}} communications protocol. A SIP address is a URI that addresses a specific <b>telephone</b> <b>extension</b> on a voice over IP system. Such a number {{could be a}} private branch exchange or an E.164 telephone number dialled through a specific gateway. The scheme was defined in RFC 3261.|$|E
50|$|Between 1977 and 1982 {{internal}} alterations to the Gympie Town Hall were undertaken {{with money}} obtained through a debenture loan {{approved by the}} Queensland Treasury. These included architectural work (probably new joinery); mechanical and electrical alterations to the auditorium; internal <b>telephone</b> <b>extension</b> relocation and switchboard installation; internal painting of the ground floor; reconstruction of the World War I remembrance alcove; new floor coverings; office equipment; and glass and timber panel partitions.|$|E
50|$|Multiple user {{identifiers}} - Employees can {{be recorded}} in an ECRS {{so that they}} may have an unlimited number of identifiers that are used with third-party systems to associate them with transactions and/or types of transactions. Identifiers may include <b>telephone</b> <b>extensions,</b> photocopy IDs, cell phone numbers, calling card codes, service account codes, login IDs, and credit card numbers.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after its}} establishment, Dialexia {{released}} Dial-Office IP-PBX, an IP PBX platform designed {{as an alternative}} to the circuit-switched telephone network. PBX is a system that connects <b>telephone</b> <b>extensions</b> of a company to outside public telephone network as well as to mobile networks. On May 21, 2014, Dial-Office was named runner-up in the IP-PBX Servers category of WindowsNetworking.com 2013-14 Readers' Choice Awards.|$|R
50|$|A closed system, {{such as an}} {{intercom}} {{or private}} branch exchange, need not comply with standards for ringing {{if it does not}} use standards-compliant <b>telephone</b> <b>extensions.</b> Some office <b>telephones</b> replace the bells with separately-wired low-voltage DC buzzers or use entirely custom-designed extensions which only work with one manufacturer's switchboard. These avoid the need to generate 20Hz 90V sinusoidal AC, but are not compatible with standard telephone ringers.|$|R
50|$|In 2010 a VPN {{client was}} added to the {{firmware}} as of release 0623C7F. A remote worker location with a broadband Internet connection can use the phone's VPN capability to securely establish an IP tunnel back to the corporate network, extending a standard voice <b>telephone</b> <b>extension</b> to any location on the Internet. Other users in the global corporation can dial the user's extension as if it were on the local network.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2004, BT Wholesale {{removed the}} line-length/loss limits for 500 kbit/s ADSL, instead {{employing}} a tactic of [...] "suck it and see" [...] — enabling the line, then seeing if ADSL would work on it. This sometimes includes {{the installation of}} a filtered faceplate on the customer's master socket, so as to eliminate poor quality <b>telephone</b> <b>extension</b> cables inside the customer's premises {{which can be a}} source of high frequency noise.|$|E
50|$|In 2010 a VPN {{client was}} added to the {{firmware}} as of release 0623C7F. This means that it is very easy to send the phone to a remote worker location with a typical Cable Modem or DSL Internet Connection and the phone will use the VPN capability to securely establish an IP Tunnel back to the corporate network and extend a standard voice <b>telephone</b> <b>extension</b> to any location on the Internet. Other users in the global corporation can dial the user's extension and the phone will ring.|$|E
50|$|The {{demarcation}} point varies from building type and service level. In its simplest form, the {{demarcation point}} is a junction block where <b>telephone</b> <b>extensions</b> join to connect to the network. This junction block usually includes a lightning arrester (which requires a wire to ground). In multi-line installations such as businesses or apartment buildings, the demarcation point may be a punch down block. In most places this hardware existed before deregulation.|$|R
50|$|The {{hardware}} {{also has}} multiple legitimate applications. While a telephone exchange includes a central source of ringing voltage at the switchboard, a {{private branch exchange}} or telephone-based intercom must provide a local source of AC ringing voltage. Theatrical performances often deploy a ringing telephone on-stage as a stage prop. An analog telephone adapter for voice over IP applications has to provide its own ringing voltage generator and other line signaling services for standard <b>telephone</b> <b>extensions.</b> The hardware may also be useful to technicians for test purposes.|$|R

50|$|For {{direct inward dialing}} service, the {{telephone}} company provides one or more trunk lines to the customer for connection to the customer's PBX, and allocates a range of telephone numbers to the customer. Calls to such numbers are forwarded to the customer's PBX via the trunks. As calls are presented to the PBX, the dialed telephone number is signaled to the PBX with Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) using a prearranged, usually partial format, e.g., the last four digits. The PBX may use this information to route the call directly to a <b>telephone</b> <b>extension</b> within the organization {{without the need for}} an operator or attendant. The service provides inbound telephone service for many telephone numbers requiring {{only a limited number of}} physical telecommunication circuits to satisfy the average concurrent usage by the customer.|$|E
5000|$|In theory, {{any sign}} could be {{composed}} of figurae, but {{care must be taken}} in distinguishing between the control-number-like function of figurae (as in the individual digits of a <b>telephone</b> <b>extension)</b> and the syntax-like function of meaning constituents (as in the area code of a full telephone number). For example, the symbols for the lines of the New York City subway system are composed of very elementary parts, e.g., letters or numbers and colors. While the assignment of letters to trains is arbitrary, and colors are arbitrarily assigned to various avenues in Manhattan, the combination of a letter or number and color is not arbitrary. That is, the symbol for the A Train has to be blue, since it runs along Eighth Avenue and all other Eighth Avenue train symbols are blue. Therefore, these colors cannot be considered figurae.|$|E
50|$|In {{business}} telephony, a <b>telephone</b> <b>extension</b> may {{refer to}} a phone on an internal telephone line attached to a private branch exchange (PBX) or Centrex system. The PBX operates much as a community switchboard does for a geographic telephone numbering plan and allows multiple lines inside the office to connect without each phone requiring a separate outside line. In these systems, one usually has to dial a number (typically 9 in North America, 0 in Europe) to tell the PBX to connect with an outside landline (also called DDCO, or Direct Dial Central Office) to dial an external number. Within the PBX, the user merely dials the extension number to reach any other user directly. For inbound calls, a switchboard operator or automated attendant may request {{the number of the}} desired extension or the call may be completed with direct inbound dialing if outside numbers are assigned to individual extensions.|$|E
50|$|Paging {{systems support}} several popular direct {{connection}} protocols, including TAP, TNPP, SNPP, and WCTP, {{as well as}} proprietary modem- and socket-based protocols. Additionally, organizations often integrate paging systems with their Voice-mail and PBX systems, conceptually attaching pagers to a <b>telephone</b> <b>extensions,</b> and they set up web portals to integrate pagers into other parts of their enterprise. A paging system alerts a pager (or group of pagers) by transmitting information over an RF channel, including an address and message information. This information is formatted using a paging protocol, such as 2-tone, 5/6-tone, GOLAY, POCSAG, FLEX, ERMES, or NTT. Two-way pagers and response pagers typically use the ReFLEX protocol.|$|R
50|$|The campus {{has its own}} suburb {{and is one of}} the few {{university}} campuses in Australia to have its own postcode (3800), and shares the <b>telephone</b> number <b>extension</b> of 990 with the other city campuses of the university. The Campus features a wide range of native Australian flora and fauna, including over 2000 different kinds of plant life.|$|R
5000|$|Centrex obviates {{the need}} for {{separate}} exchange lines delivered to a site for use with a 1A2 Key System or similar, or PBX. Instead, <b>telephone</b> <b>extensions,</b> called Centrex lines, are delivered directly from the local exchange to the user. Some customers, however, still like to use a key telephone system for a small office within the large corporate Centrex, in an arrangement called [...] "key behind Centrex". Unlike with a conventional PBX, {{it is a simple}} matter to have extensions at different locations while allowing them to function as if they were within the same building. Newer IP PBX systems also allow phones at any location with a WAN or Internet connection to act as a local extension. Facilities such as Direct Inward Dialing (DID), where individual extensions are offered a direct and unique telephone number for incoming calls, are standard features in a Centrex environment. Stations may also be part of a hunt group, allowing for automatic distribution of incoming calls to two or more extensions.|$|R
50|$|Out for a {{walk the}} next day, Rita leads Valentine back to Kern's house. He says she should keep the dog after {{confirming}} that he sent {{the money for the}} expenses. Valentine hears that Kern is eavesdropping on a male neighbour's sexual telephone conversation with his male lover. The judge challenges Valentine to tell the neighbour. She goes to do so but is horrified to see the man's young daughter on the <b>telephone</b> <b>extension,</b> listening to the same conversation. Upon her return, Kern tells her that their actions of telling / not telling and spying / not spying make no difference to the eventual outcome of other people's lives. Before leaving, Valentine also hears a conversation between Auguste and his girlfriend, Karin (Frederique Feder) neither of whom she has met. Auguste passes his exam to become a judge and credits his success to the dropped textbook.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to rope, other materials {{can easily be}} fashioned into an improvised noose e.g. a bed-sheet, ripped T-shirt, shoelaces or <b>telephone</b> <b>extension</b> cable. Regardless of the material used to form the noose, suspension hanging will kill its victims in three ways: compression of the carotid arteries, the jugular veins, or the airway. About 11 lb of pressure is required to compress the carotid artery; 4.4 lb for the jugular veins; and at least 15 kg for the airway. The {{amount of time it}} takes to lose consciousness and die is difficult to predict accurately and depends on several factors. Some believe unconsciousness occurs in five seconds, though Alan Gunn writes that it generally takes longer. It took a man who filmed his hanging 13 seconds to become unconscious, 1 minute and 38 seconds to lose muscle tone, and 4 minutes and 10 seconds for muscle movement to cease. Full suspension is not required; most hanging suicides are done by partial suspension, according to Wyatt et al. Geo Stone, author of Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences, suggests that death by obstruction of the airway is more painful than by the other ways.|$|E
5000|$|The drop curtain he {{designed}} featured patches of muted color (earth tones and pastel shades of blue, white and red) suggesting forms and landscape, {{over which the}} figures of a guitar-playing Harlequin and Pierrot with a violin were sinuously outlined in black; a lyre, the invention of Mercury, lies at their feet. A dimensional effect was created through dissociation of line and color. These principles were carried over into the largely monochrome backdrops and scenic constructions. Reliefs of painted rattan and wire were mounted on large cutouts with moveable parts, which hidden dancers shifted about the stage and manipulated along with the music. Some of them took the place of characters. The three-headed Cerberus was depicted on a circular shield beneath which only the dancer's feet were visible, and Massine described how the Three Graces were transformed into amorphous flats [...] "with plaited necks like <b>telephone</b> <b>extension</b> wires which stretched and contracted as their heads bobbed up and down." [...] André Breton called these puppet-like objects [...] "tragic toys for adults." [...] In counterpoint to the static poses of Massine's choreography, Picasso's mobile scenery {{became part of the}} dance.|$|E
5000|$|Intentional {{non-return}} of rental equipment (such as <b>extension</b> <b>telephones)</b> when relocating {{to a new}} address. The equipment {{would then}} be used at the new location without paying a monthly equipment rental fee. This has become rare as most telephones are now owned outright, not rented.|$|R
5000|$|An off-premises {{extension}} (OPX), sometimes {{also known as}} off-premises station (OPS), is an <b>extension</b> <b>telephone</b> at a location distant from its servicing private branch exchange (PBX).

40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma(Technology) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1988 The project entails {{designing}} and installing an emergency fire telephone system (EFTS) for the 23 storey Cape Town Administrative Civic Centre. The original system, with its mostly analogue circuitry, has no documentation available, {{is difficult to}} maintain and has become unreliable. After considering alternative systems the most economical option was to expand the original system by adding more <b>extension</b> <b>telephones</b> and to redesign the control section. The new EFTS briefly operates as follows: The status of ninety six <b>extension</b> <b>telephones,</b> installed at the emergency exits on each floor, are displayed on a mimic status display which both operators can monitor. Any emergency call can be identified by a green flashing LED and a distinctive bleep. The LED indicates the exact position and number of the telephone in the building, Each operator has a keypad and a two digit numeric display fitted his telephone. The operator can immediately answer incoming calls by pressing the queue button. Calls queue on a {{first in first out}} basis. The number of the <b>extension</b> <b>telephone</b> will be displayed on a numeric display. The operator can also select the extension he wishes to contact, by dialling the extension number on the keypad. The EFTS consists of nine printed circuit boards. A rack mounted Microcomputer board, made up of a Motorola MC 6809 microprocessor, six 6821 PlAs, 2 kilobyte RAM, up to 16 kilobyte ROM and a watchdog timer controls the EFTS. Two Telephone Controller boards process voice signals and generate logic control signals for the CMOS voice switching circuitry on the Multiplexer Monitor boards. Six Multiplexer Monitor boards switch the two operators to any of the ninety six <b>extension</b> <b>telephones</b> and continuously monitor the <b>extension</b> <b>telephone</b> lines for faults and handset statuses. Noise and over voltage line protection is provided. The multiplexing of the 192 LEDs on the Mimic Status Display is controlled by the Microcomputer board. An unusual principle used in this design is the combination of low frequency AM and audio to affect communication. Two uninterruptable power supplies provide user independence from mains. Software used for the EFTS is written in 6809 Assembly Language. A Real time interrupt controls the Mimic Status Display. Operator actions are interfaced with the program logic by means of hardware interrupts...|$|R
