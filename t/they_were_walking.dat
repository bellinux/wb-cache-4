25|$|After Nash {{was unable}} to {{convince}} Hogan to re–hire Hall and Waltman and failed to secure a meeting with Eric Bischoff, he {{set his sights on}} renewing his feud with Jeff Jarrett, who claimed that Nash had tried to hurt TNA by bringing Hall and Waltman in. On the August 5 episode of Impact!, Sting, who had feuded with Jarrett prior to his 30-day suspension, returned to TNA and, together with Nash, beat down Jarrett, Bischoff and Hogan. On the August 26 episode of Impact!, Nash defeated Jarrett in a singles match, after an interference from Sting. The following week Nash helped Sting defeat Jarrett. After the match Samoa Joe aligned himself with Jarrett and Hogan and drove Nash and Sting away. At No Surrender Jarrett and Joe defeated Nash and Sting in a tag team match, after Jarrett hit Sting with a baseball bat. On the September 16 episode of Reaction, Nash and Sting were joined by D'Angelo Dinero, who claimed to have gotten inside information from Bischoff's secretary Miss Tessmacher, that would suggest that Nash and Sting were right about Hogan and Bischoff being up to something. At Bound for Glory Nash, Sting and Dinero faced Jeff Jarrett and Samoa Joe in a handicap match, after Hulk Hogan, who was scheduled to team with Jarrett and Joe, was forced to pull out due to back surgery. At the end of the match Jarrett abandoned Joe and left him to be pinned by Nash. At the end of the event it was revealed that Nash and Sting had been right about Hogan and Bischoff all along, as they aligned themselves with Jarrett, Abyss and Jeff Hardy. On October 13, 2010, Nash's contract with TNA expired and he announced his retirement from professional wrestling. His last TNA appearance was a taped broadcast on October 14, 2010, when Nash and Sting both announced <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>walking</b> away from TNA rather than being a part of Hogan and Bischoff's regime. In January 2011 Nash signed a new contract with TNA, but was granted a release before reappearing on television, after being contacted by WWE.|$|E

Two weeks later Shotton encountered McCartney cycling through Woolton, and conveyed Lennon's casual invitation for him to join the Quarrymen, and Vaughan also invited McCartney to join. McCartney said he would join after Scout camp in Hathersage, and a holiday with his family at Butlins holiday camp in Filey, Yorkshire. Shotton and Davis both left the Quarrymen in August, feeling that the group was moving away from skiffle and towards rock, leaving their instruments superfluous.

500|$|One major {{breakthrough}} was {{the composition of}} the song [...] "Let It Go" [...] by songwriters Lopez and Anderson-Lopez, which forced the production team to reconceptualize and rewrite Elsa as a far more complex, vulnerable, and sympathetic character.

[...] Lee recalled: [...] "Bobby and Kristen said <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>walking</b> in Prospect Park and they just started talking about what would it feel like [...] Forget villain. Just what it would feel like. And this concept of letting out who she is that she's kept to herself for so long and she's alone and free, but then the sadness of the fact [...] that the last moment is she's alone.

[...] Del Vecho explained that [...] "Let It Go" [...] changed Elsa into a person [...] "ruled by fear and Anna was ruled by her own love of other people and her own drive," [...] which in turn caused Lee to [...] "rewrite the first act and then that rippled through the entire movie.

500|$|According to the {{official}} account of the operation, Savage entered Gibraltar undetected in a white Renault 5 at 12:45 (CET; UTC+1) on 6 March 1988. An MI5 officer recognised {{him and he was}} followed, but he was not positively identified for almost an hour and a half, during which time he parked the vehicle in the car park used as the assembly area for the changing of the guard. At 14:30, McCann and Farrell were observed crossing the frontier from Spain and were also followed. They met Savage in the car park at around 14:50 and a few minutes later the three began walking through the town. After the three left the car park, [...] "Soldier G", a bomb-disposal officer, was ordered to examine Savage's car; he returned after a few minutes and reported that the vehicle should be treated as a suspect car bomb. This soldier's suspicion was conveyed as certainty to Soldiers [...] "A", [...] "B", [...] "C", and [...] "D", who were ordered into positions to intercept Savage, McCann, and Farrell as they walked north towards the Spanish border. [...] "Soldier G"'s information convinced Gibraltar Police Commissioner Joseph Canepa, who was controlling the operation, to order the arrest of the three suspects. To that end, he signed over control of the operation to [...] "Soldier F", the senior SAS officer, at 15:40. Two minutes after receiving control, [...] "Soldier F" [...] ordered Soldiers [...] "A", [...] "B", [...] "C", and [...] "D" [...] to apprehend the IRA operatives, by which time <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>walking</b> north on Winston Churchill Avenue towards the airport and the border.

500|$|The {{design of}} the Tripods was {{described}} by Spielberg as [...] "graceful," [...] with artist Doug Chiang replicating aquatic life forms. At the same time, the director wanted a design that would be iconic while still providing {{a tribute to the}} original Tripods, as well as intimidating so the audience would not be more interested about the aliens inside than on the vehicle itself. The visual effects crew tried to blend organic and mechanical elements in the Tripods depiction, and made extensive studies for the movements of the vehicle to be believable, considering the [...] "contradiction" [...] of having a large tank-like head being carried by thin and flexible legs. Animator Randal M. Dutra considered the movements themselves to have a [...] "terrestrial buoyance", in that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>walking</b> on land but had an aquatic flow, and Spielberg described the Tripods as moving like [...] "scary ballet dancers". [...] Most of the alien elements revolved around the number three – the Tripod had three eyes, and both the vehicle and the aliens had three main limbs with three fingers each. Visual effects supervisor Pablo Helman considered depicting the scale of the Tripod as challenging, considering [...] "Steven {{wanted to make sure that}} these creatures were 150 feet tall", as it was the height described by Wells in the novel. The aliens themselves had designs based on jellyfish, with movements inspired by red-eyed tree frogs, and an amphibian quality particularly on the wet skin. A styrofoam alien was used as a stand-in to guide the actors in the basement scene. Spielberg did not want any blood or gore during the Heat-Ray deaths; in the words of Helman, [...] "this was going to be a horror movie for kids". So the effects crew came up with the vaporization of the bodies, and considering it could not be fully digital due to both the complexity of the effect and the schedule, live-action dust was used alongside the CGI ray assimilation and particles. Digital [...] birds followed the Tripods in most scenes to symbolize the presence of death, which Chiang compared to vultures and added that [...] "you don't know if these birds are going to the danger or away from it, if you should follow them or run away." ...|$|E

[...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying, [...] "Despicable Me is a 3D cartoon comedy of whiplash-quick laughs, funny punch lines and a wickedly gimmicky appreciation for 3D." [...] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press wrote, [...] "Kids will dig it, adults will smile with amusement, and no one will be any different afterward than <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>walking</b> into the theater."

2500|$|In ancient times, when Wang Liang and Zaofu went driving, [...] they mounted their chariots {{and took}} hold of the reins, the horses set {{themselves}} in order and wanted to work together.

Their hearts were in tune and their qi harmonious; their bodies [...] more and more light and coordinated.

All people of that era considered [...] to be superlative , but that was because they had not yet seen any [...] worthy ones. Now consider the charioteering of Qian Qie and Da Bing.
