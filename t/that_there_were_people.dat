5|$|The list {{of former}} Registrars {{published}} by the university in the 19th century begins with John London, who died in 1508. Records show <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>people</b> before London carrying out similar tasks in the 15th century, and the university regards the role as having a 550-year history. There is a record of a resolution by the university, of uncertain date in the 15th century, that a registrar or scribe should be appointed to draft letters, record the university's public acts, copy its documents, and record the names of graduates. The position carried an annual salary of four marks (£2 13 shillings and 4 pence); fees had {{to be paid to}} the Registrar by individuals obtaining their degrees or recording other permissions granted by the university. In 1448, a John Manyngham signed a letter for the university, and was permitted in 1451 to have a scholar make transcripts in the university's library; one historian of the university says that Manyngham may have been Oxford's first Registrar. John Farley, who signed his name in Greek letters as a sign of his erudition, carried out the duties from 1458 to 1464.|$|E
25|$|In c. 732 BC, the Assyrian king, Tiglath-Pileser III sacked Damascus and Israel, annexing Aramea and {{territory}} of the tribes of Reuben, Gad and Manasseh in Gilead including the desert outposts of Jetur, Naphish and Nodab.Israel continued to exist within the reduced territory as an independent kingdom subject to Assyria until around 725-720 BC, when it was again invaded by Assyria {{and the rest of}} the population deported. From this time, no trace exists of the Kingdom of Israel and its population are commonly referred as Ten Lost Tribes. The Bible (2 Kings 18:11) reports that part of these ten lost tribes were expelled to the land of the Medes in modern-day Iran. The book of Tobit, which is part of the Apocrypha suggests <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>people</b> from the tribe of Naphtali living in Rhages (Rey, Iran) and Ecbatana (Hamedan) at the time of the Assyrians (Book of Tobit 6:12).|$|E

500|$|Following {{news of the}} {{cancellation}} of Silent Hills, {{it was announced that}} P.T. would be removed from the PlayStation Network on 29 April 2015. Originally, it was reported that the demo could be re-downloaded, but in May 2015 it was no longer re-downloadable from the PlayStation Store. Cancellation of the game led to criticism of Konami. Patrick Klepek from Kotaku stated [...] "It's fine that Konami doesn't want to make Silent Hills" [...] but that the deletion of P.T. was wrong since the demo had become part of gaming culture. Nick Robinson of Polygon described Konami's removal as the [...] "most irresponsible, cowardly decision possible", but that the subsequent unavailability had also made the demo [...] "one of the coolest, most fascinating games {{in the history of our}} medium". After {{the cancellation}}, PlayStation 4 consoles with P.T. installed were listed on eBay for over $1000; eBay later pulled the auctions down. The incident has been compared to the mass selling of iPhones containing Flappy Bird after that game's removal from the iOS App Store. Guillermo del Toro, the intended future director of Silent Hills, commented on P.T.s popularity, speculating <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>people</b> who still have a passion for the Silent Hill series.|$|E

2500|$|On June 24, the Synod deposed Safirin for the slanderous accusations he {{had brought}} against Metropolitan Atanasie. This outcome was impatiently expected, but largely predictable—days earlier, speculations on this topic had {{surfaced}} in Dimineața daily; the left-wing Facla discussed the trial as [...] "a travesty". Nonetheless, a few days after, the Metropolitan handed in his resignation. Although {{he claimed to have}} acted on his distress with the scandal, speculation arose that he had pushed into it—either by the swinging political consensus or, more specifically, by Arion's resentment. By October, the laws on the election of bishops were rewritten in a non-controversial way: [...] "metropolitans could be elected only from bishops, while bishops could be elected from any member of the Romanian clergy.

The contras arrived, they devastated it, they destroyed and burned everything. They arrived in front of a little house and turned their machinegun fire on it, without bothering to check if there were any people inside. Two children, who had taken fright and hidden under a bed, were hit. I could say the same thing of a man and woman who were hit, this was in the little co-operative of Sacadias Olivas. It was just the same. They too had taken fright and got into bed. Unlike El Coco, the contras had just been on the attack, they had encountered resistance and were now in flight. During their flight they went into a house, and seeing <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>people</b> there, they threw grenade.

2500|$|Stein, {{writing in}} The Mismeasure of Desire (1999), criticized Ruse's book. Stein found Ruse's {{definition}} of a [...] "homosexual" [...] to be vague and open to possible objections, noting that Ruse does not explain whether he considers someone who only rarely wants {{to have sex with}} a person of the same sex [...] "homosexual", or whether wanting to have sex with a person of the opposite sex would disqualify a person from being [...] "homosexual". Though Stein granted that Ruse's definition is wide enough to be a candidate for playing a role in explanation in the sciences or the social sciences, he maintained that its wideness does not prove that sexual orientations are non-arbitrary groups ("natural kinds"). Stein found Ruse's critique of social constructionism unconvincing. He rejected Ruse's suggestion that defining sexual orientation in terms of sexual feelings rather than sexual behavior shows that social constructionism is false. Stein observed that while Ruse refers to the work of John Boswell to support his case <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>people</b> in periods from that Ancient Greece to that of the Renaissance who were recognized as having a homosexual orientation, such evidence can be interpreted differently. Stein rejected Ruse's defense of sexual orientation research, arguing that the ethical implications of a research program must be considered in deciding whether the program is worth pursuing.|$|E
2500|$|Su Ze {{was still}} the Administrator of Jincheng Commandery when he first heard that the Cao Wei state had {{replaced}} the Eastern Han dynasty, and he thought that Emperor Xian was dead so he held {{a memorial service for}} the emperor. Later, he became awkwardly silent when he found out that Emperor Xian was alive and had been made the Duke of Shanyang (山陽公) after his abdication. Cao Zhi, a younger brother of Cao Pi, also shed tears when he heard of the fall of the Han dynasty. Cao Zhi's grief, however, was also partly because of the frustration he felt at losing to Cao Pi when they were fighting for the succession to their father's place. After Cao Pi became emperor, he was surprised to learn <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>people</b> who cried when they heard that Emperor Xian had abdicated the throne to him, so he asked his subjects why. At the point in time, Cao Pi already knew about Cao Zhi, but not about Su Ze, so his question was directed at Cao Zhi. Su Ze thought that Cao Pi was referring to him, so he prepared to step up and respond. However, Fu Xun, another Palace Attendant, stopped him and said, [...] "(His Majesty) is not talking about you." [...] Su Ze then backed down.|$|E
