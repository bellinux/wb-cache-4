25|$|By {{counting}} {{the number of}} wraps for the skein, and measuring the length of one wrap, the approximate yardage can be calculated. The yardage is approximate because an exact yardage requires an even tension throughout wrapping the whole skein. Also, a very large skein requires wrapping the new layers on top of the old, which increases the length of the <b>top</b> <b>layers.</b>|$|E
25|$|PAHs {{transform}} {{slowly to}} a wide range of degradation products. Biological degradation by microbes is a dominant form of PAH transformation in the environment. Soil-consuming invertebrates such as earthworms speed PAH degradation, either through direct metabolism or by improving the conditions for microbial transformations. Abiotic degradation in the atmosphere and the <b>top</b> <b>layers</b> of surface waters can produce nitrogenated, halogenated, hydroxylated, and oxygenated PAHs; some of these compounds can be more toxic, water-soluble, and mobile than their parent PAHs.|$|E

25|$|The general {{movement}} of the EGC is southward along the eastern Greenland continental margin. The currents are quite strong with annual averages of 6–12cm/s in {{the upper part of}} the EGC (<500 m) with inter-annual maximums of 20–30nbsp&cm/s. It was estimated in 1991 by Hopkins et al. that the transport of water southward ranged from 2–32 sverdrups. That is quite a large variation that they attributed to the widely varying strength of the Atlantic Water flow at intermediate depths. More recent estimations of water transport in the <b>top</b> <b>layers</b> (<800 m) of the EGC is between 3 and 4 sverdrups.|$|E
25|$|The three <b>top</b> <b>layers</b> in the OSI model, i.e. the {{application}} layer, the presentation layer and the session layer, are not distinguished separately in the TCP/IP model which only has an application layer above the transport layer. While some pure OSI protocol applications, such as X.400, also combined them, {{there is no}} requirement that a TCP/IP protocol stack must impose monolithic architecture above the transport layer. For example, the NFS application protocol runs over the eXternal Data Representation (XDR) presentation protocol, which, in turn, runs over a protocol called Remote Procedure Call (RPC). RPC provides reliable record transmission, so it can safely use the best-effort UDP transport.|$|E
25|$|Polysilicon {{is not a}} great {{conductor}} (approximately 1000 {{times more}} resistive than metals) which reduces the signal propagation speed through the material. The resistivity can be lowered by increasing the level of doping, but even highly doped polysilicon is not as conductive as most metals. To improve conductivity further, sometimes a high-temperature metal such as tungsten, titanium, cobalt, and more recently nickel is alloyed with the <b>top</b> <b>layers</b> of the polysilicon. Such a blended material is called silicide. The silicide-polysilicon combination has better electrical properties than polysilicon alone and still does not melt in subsequent processing. Also the threshold voltage is not significantly higher than with polysilicon alone, because the silicide material is not near the channel. The process in which silicide is formed on both the gate electrode and the source and drain regions is sometimes called salicide, self-aligned silicide.|$|E

After anodic formation of a nanopore array, the PEC process repeated in the same electrolyte under illumination.

50|$|The {{result of}} {{applying}} {{several of these}} modes depends linearly on the pixel level of the <b>top</b> <b>layer.</b> In such cases, when the <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> is purely black, one gets a certain transformation of the bottom layer (which may be just a purely black or purely white image). When the <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> is purely white, one gets another such transformation. The intermediate gray values are described above using the opacity slider on the second transformation.|$|R
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that the appearance of oxygenic photosynthesis increased biological productivity {{by a factor of}} between 100 and 1,000. All photosynthetic reactions require a reducing agent, but the significance of oxygenic photosynthesis is that it uses water as a reducing agent, and water is much more plentiful than the geologically produced reducing agents on which photosynthesis previously depended. The resulting increases in the populations of photosynthesizing bacteria in the <b>top</b> <b>layers</b> of microbial mats would have caused corresponding population increases among the chemotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms that inhabited the lower layers and which fed respectively on the by-products of the photosynthesizers and on the corpses and / or living bodies of the other mat organisms. These increases would have made microbial mats the planet's dominant ecosystems. From this point onwards life itself produced significantly more of the resources it needed than did geochemical processes.|$|E
25|$|PFOA {{contaminates}} every continent. PFOA {{has been}} {{detected in the}} central Pacific Ocean at low parts per quadrillion ranges, and at low parts per trillion levels in coastal waters. Due to the surfactant nature of PFOA, {{it has been found}} to concentrate in the <b>top</b> <b>layers</b> of ocean water. PFOA is detected widely in surface waters, and is present in numerous mammals, fish, and bird species. PFOA is in the blood or vital organs of Atlantic salmon, swordfish, striped mullet, gray seals, common cormorants, Alaskan polar bears, brown pelicans, sea turtles, sea eagles, Midwestern bald eagles, California sea lions and Laysan albatrosses on Sand Island, a wildlife refuge on Midway Atoll, {{in the middle of the}} North Pacific Ocean, about halfway between North America and Asia. However, wildlife has much less PFOA than humans, unlike PFOS and other longer perfluorinated carboxylic acids; in wildlife, PFOA is not as bioaccumulative as longer perfluorinated carboxylic acids.|$|E

30|$|The {{second stage}} of nanocone {{formation}} in elementary semiconductors is laser heating up of the <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> enriched by interstitial atoms with further plastic deformation due to compressive stress caused by interstitials in the <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> and vacancies in the buried layer.|$|R
30|$|In {{the case}} of the {{elementary}} semiconductors, at the first stage of the process, a thin <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> with mechanical compressive stress due to separation and redistribution of interstitials and vacancies in gradient temperature field [14] on the irradiated surface of the semiconductors is formed. As a result, interstitials are concentrated at the irradiated surface of semiconductor, forming the <b>top</b> <b>layer.</b> Vacancies are concentrated under the <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> forming a buried layer with mechanical tension due to the absence of atoms. Sometimes vacancies form nanocavities [17]. At the second stage of the process, nanocones are formed on the irradiated surface of the semiconductors due to plastic deformation of the <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> {{in the same way as}} in the previous case with semiconductor solid solutions.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the design}} of {{revetment}} engineering under wave action, to resist the wave action, the pattern of <b>Top</b> <b>layer</b> - Filter layer – Core(subsoil) is often adopted. In general, the structure of <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> is usually single discrete blocks, typically accropode blocks, four-leg square hollow blocks and barrier boards, and also acropode, riprap, paved rock blocks or concrete slabs where with smaller waves. Such <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> has been provided with many research findings on its stability and is widely used in engineering. Setting a filter <b>layer</b> between the <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> and the lower dike core mainly has two functions: (1) giving certain permeability, to minimize the hydrodynamic load directly acting on the lower foundation soil; (2) giving certain hydraulic tightness, to prevent fine sediment of the lower foundation soil being rushed out. This paper is focused on a special filter layer with geotextile as its upper structure and coarse aggregate as its lower structure. By simulating geotextile with different permeability and coarse aggregate with different size, The pressure of <b>top</b> of cover <b>layer</b> and the down side of the geotextile is tested under wave actions, and compared with theoretical analysis, in this way, how the permeability of geotextile impacts the stability of <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> is studyed. The research shows that when the lower coarse aggregate under the geotextile has high permeability and the geotextile's permeability get poorer, the uplift force to the <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> will be increased under wave action, which will cause damage to the <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> when it si greater than the vertical component force of the block gravity under the water...|$|R
