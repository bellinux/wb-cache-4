40|$|Abstract—Background: Subjects with hemispatial neglect often exhibit {{representational}} neglect: {{a failure}} to report details from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of mentally visualized images. This failure could reflect impaired ability <b>to</b> generate <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> mental image, or it could reflect failure <b>to</b> explore <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of a normally generated mental image. When subjects with hemispatial neglect look at pictures or drawings, their attention tends to be drawn <b>to</b> objects on <b>the</b> right side, thereby aggravating their failure <b>to</b> explore <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side.</b> If representational neglect represents a failure <b>to</b> explore <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of a normally generated mental visual image, then it should be improved by blindfolding, which removes the attention-catching right-sided stimuli. However, if representational neglect represents a failure <b>to</b> generate <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> mental visual image, then blindfolding should have little impact on reporting of details of <b>the</b> image. Methods: <b>To</b> determine which of these explanations is correct, we asked eight normal participants and eight brain-damaged patients with left representational neglect <b>to</b> imagine <b>the</b> map of France and to name as many towns as possible in 2 minutes. In different sessions, participants performed the task with eyes open or while blindfolded. Results: Normal participants mentioned more towns while blindfolded than with vision, thus suggesting a distracting effect of visual details on mental imagery. Patients with neglect, however, showed no appreciable effect of blindfolding on reporting of details from either side of mental images. Conclusion: Representational neglect may represent a failure <b>to</b> generate <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of mental images...|$|R
5|$|Pittsburgh added {{their second}} {{touchdown}} {{of the game}} on their opening drive {{of the second half}} when Moore rushed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> for 13yards. Cincinnati retaliated on their ensuing drive adding a field goal from Dave Rayner. The Steelers scored three consecutive touchdowns in the final quarter, while holding the Bengals scoreless. At 8:26 of the fourth quarter Roethlisberger connected with Nate Washington for a 50-yard touchdown pass. Pittsburgh's Moore scored his third touchdown of the day—his second rushing—and Hines Ward's 16-yard touchdown reception gave the Steelers 31points to the Bengals' ten. Moore finished the game with 120yards rushing, while Santonio Holmes lead the Steelers with 89Receiving yards.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{physician}} Galen (2nd century CE) knew {{blood vessels}} carried blood and identified venous (dark red) and arterial (brighter and thinner) blood, each with distinct and separate functions. Galen, noting the heart as the hottest organ in the body, {{concluded that it}} provided heat to the body. The heart did not pump blood around, the heart's motion sucked blood in during diastole and the blood moved by the pulsation of the arteries themselves. Galen believed the arterial blood was created by venous blood passing from the left ventricle to the right through 'pores' between the ventricles. Air from the lungs passed from the lungs via the pulmonary artery <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> {{of the heart and}} created arterial blood.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was {{returned}} to the Clemson 26-yard line, and the drive began with an incomplete pass from Dantzler. After that, the Tigers gained their first down of {{the game with a}} pass from Dantzler to wide receiver Rod Gardner at the 38-yard line. A run by Dantzler gained three yards, then Zachery gained five more with a run <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side.</b> Zachery's run ran the final seconds off the clock in the first quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech leading, 140.|$|E

5|$|Advisors {{are large}} larvae-like creatures which are {{virtually}} featureless, with no visible eyes, ears or limbs, {{though they do}} possess an eye-like mechanical device attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of their heads, and detachable mechanical arms. Their faces are covered by a form of respirator, which is able to lift to reveal a mouth-like orifice from which extends a long flexible proboscis. With this, they can examine objects, or attack and kill enemies. Advisors appear to be feeding upon their victim during their attacks. It is implied that Advisors are the original master race behind the Combine, with the Earth administrator Wallace Breen answering directly to them. Although Advisors are usually seen in protective pods guarded by Combine soldiers, they also possess telekinetic powers {{with which they are}} able to float through the air and immobilize enemies so that their proboscis can examine their victims without interference. Their appearance was based on the Guild Navigators from the film Dune.|$|E
5|$|Clemson's post-touchdown kickoff was bobbled by kick {{returner}} Andre Kendrick at the Tech one-yard line, but Kendrick {{broke free}} of the Clemson defense for a 34-yard return to the 35-yard line. Tech's first play after the return was an 11-yard run by Lee Suggs up {{the right side of}} the field. After the first down, Suggs ran straight ahead for a short gain, then Vick scrambled to the Clemson 37-yard line and another first down. Suggs then gained 18 yards on a run <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the field. At the Clemson 19-yard line, Suggs was stopped for a loss of one yard, then Vick was sacked for a loss of five yards. The third-down play was an incomplete pass, and Carter Warley entered the game to attempt a 42-yard field goal. The kick bounced off the field goal crossbar but did not cross it, thus denying the Hokies three points. With 10:33 remaining in the half, Tech still had a 147 lead.|$|E
5|$|Each {{receiver}} antenna {{was sent to}} one of the channels of the displays in turn, causing one of the displays to refresh. For instance, at a given instant the switch might be set to send the signal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the azimuth display. The timebase generator was triggered to start sweeping the CRT dot up the screen after the transmission ended. Reflections would cause the dot to be deflected to the left, creating a blip whose vertical location could be measured against a scale to determine range. The switch would then move to the next position and cause the right-hand side of the display to be redrawn, but the signal inverted so the dot moved to the right. The switching occurred fast enough that the display looked continuous.|$|E

5|$|Realizing Calgary's {{path to the}} Stanley Cup {{would go}} through Edmonton, coach Bob Johnson devised a seven-point plan for beating the Oilers that focused on {{limiting}} Wayne Gretzky, Paul Coffey and Jari Kurri's creativity, limiting access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the ice where the Oilers' top stars liked to skate, leaving their physical players on the ice by not engaging them and utilizing Neil Sheehy and Colin Patterson in roles designed to frustrate the Oiler players. Johnson first utilized the strategy in a late season game that ended in a 4–4 tie. The Flames then defeated the Oilers 9–3 in their final regular season meeting, a game that ended with another brawl and accusations by both teams that the other was sending their goons out after talented players.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to the missed field goal, Alabama {{began its}} drive at its 25-yard line—the line of {{scrimmage}} for the field goal. In the drive's first play, Zow completed a seven-yard pass to wide receiver Calvin Hall. Alexander then ran <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> for a two-yard gain. On third down, Alexander gained three yards and a first down. After that, Moore sacked Zow for a two-yard loss, to the 35-yard line. After the sack, Zow was hit again by the Virginia Tech defense and fumbled the ball. The fumble was scooped up by an Alabama player, however, and resulted in a gain of four yards. Zow then completed a pass to Alexander at the 50-yard line for a first down. Once there, Alabama was twice penalized five yards for false starts on consecutive plays. The penalties ran out the final seconds of the first quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech leading, 70.|$|E
5|$|The heart can be {{affected}} by congenital diseases. These include failure of the developmental foramen ovale to close, present in up to 25% of people; ventricular or atrial septal defects, congenital diseases of the heart valves (e.g. congenital aortic stenosis) or disease relating to blood vessels or blood flow from the heart (such as a patent ductus arteriosus or aortic coarctation).; These may cause symptoms {{at a variety of}} ages. If unoxygenated blood travels directly from the right <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the heart, it may be noticed at birth, as it may cause a baby to become blue (cyanotic) such as Tetralogy of Fallot. A heart problem may impact a child's ability to grow. Some causes rectify with time and are regarded as benign. Other causes may be incidentally detected on a cardiac examination. These disorders are often diagnosed on an echocardiogram.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Karen {{produced}} {{light to}} moderate winds across Atlantic Canada, peaking at 47mph (76km/h) with {{a gust of}} 64mph (103km/h) in Cape George in Antigonish County, Nova Scotia, along with a 26mph (42km/h) report in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Rainbands in the storm dropped light rainfall of up to 1.8inches (46mm) in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia and 1.4inches (35mm) in Saint John, New Brunswick, most of which fell in {{a short amount of}} time. Skewed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the transitioning storm, the rainfall was beneficial for the drought-stricken areas of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Due to the fast-moving nature of the storm, though, most areas reported only around half an inch of rain.

Damage in Canada was minor due to the storm, limited to an uprooted tree in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia and several other trees with damaged branches. There were no injuries or fatalities in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Texas {{began its}} third {{possession}} with 7:58 {{remaining in the}} quarter. From the 28-yard line, running back Shon Mitchell gained 14 yards and a first down at the 42-yard line. Brown then completed a 26-yard pass to Adams, who earned a first down at the Tech 32-yard line. Now in Tech territory, Mitchell gained eight yards on a run <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the field. On second down, Williams ran straight ahead for a first down at the Tech 17-yard line. Mitchell then advanced to the 12-yard line on a running play, but Brown threw an incomplete pass on second down. Facing a third down and needing five yards, Texas was stopped for a short gain, but Tech was called for an offsides penalty. The five yards negated the third-down stop and gave Texas a first down at the six-yard line of Virginia Tech. Two plays later, Brown completed a pass to tight end Pat Fitzgerald, who ran {{into the end zone}} for a touchdown. The subsequent extra point kick was good, and Texas took a 70 lead with 4:32 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: {{the left side of the}} brain interacts with the right side of the body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body, and visual input from the left side of the visual field.|$|E
