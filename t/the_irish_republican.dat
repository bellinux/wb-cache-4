5|$|The pro-independence republican party, Sinn Féin, {{received}} overwhelming endorsement in {{the general}} election of 1918, and in 1919 proclaimed an Irish Republic, setting up its own parliament (Dáil Éireann) and government. Simultaneously the Volunteers, which became known as <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>Republican</b> Army (IRA), launched a three-year guerrilla war, which ended in a truce in July 1921 (although violence continued until June 1922, mostly in Northern Ireland).|$|E
5|$|From 1865 to 1867, British {{authorities}} {{rounded up}} supporters of <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>Republican</b> Brotherhood, or Fenians, an Irish independence movement, and transported sixty-two {{of them to}} Western Australia. In 1869, John Boyle O'Reilly escaped on the American whaling ship Gazelle and settled in Boston.

5|$|The Easter Rising was a {{rebellion}} staged in Ireland during Easter Week, 1916. It was mounted by Irish republicans with {{the aims of}} ending British rule in Ireland and establishing an Irish Republic. Organised by the Military Council of <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>Republican</b> Brotherhood, the rising lasted from 24–30 April 1916. Members of the Irish Volunteers, joined by the smaller Irish Citizen Army, along with 200 members of Cumann na mBan, seized key locations in Dublin and proclaimed an Irish Republic independent of Britain.|$|E

5|$|After the Omagh bombing, the RIRA {{leadership}} {{were unwilling}} to launch a full-scale campaign in Northern Ireland due {{to the possibility of}} civilians being killed. Instead they decided to launch a series of attacks in England, in particular London, which they hoped would attract disenchanted Provisional IRA members to join the RIRA. On 1 June 2000 a bomb damaged Hammersmith Bridge; a symbolic target for Irish republican paramilitary groups. The bridge had been targeted by <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>Republican</b> Army on 29 March 1939 as part of its Sabotage Campaign, and by the Provisional IRA on 24 April 1996.|$|E

After Brendan Behan's early death at the age of 41 on 20 March 1964, Goulding had Paudge Behan with Brendan's widow Beatrice. Paudge and his half-sister Blanaid grew up at 5 Anglesea Road, a red-brick, semi-detached late Victorian house in Ballsbridge, Dublin, which Brendan Behan bought for his wife Beatrice in 1959 for IR£1,400.

He decides to lodge at the seaside Admiral Benbow Inn for the weekend, until he can depart for Italy.|$|E
5|$|Descended from Irish {{nationalist}} grandparents on both sides, Neal {{has been}} an advocate for Irish concerns throughout his Congressional career, pushing to keep the United States involved in the Northern Ireland peace process.

After the disarmament of <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>Republican</b> Army (IRA) in September 2005, Neal was among a group of Congressmen who met with Sinn Féin MP Martin McGuinness to congratulate him on the action of disarmament and ensure a lasting peace had been reached.

5|$|In 1919, {{the frustrations}} caused by delays to Irish home rule led the MPs of Sinn Féin, a pro-independence party that {{had won a}} {{majority}} of the Irish seats in the 1918 British general election, to establish an independent parliament in Dublin, at which Irish independence was declared. <b>The</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>Republican</b> Army simultaneously began a guerrilla war against the British administration. The Anglo-Irish War ended in 1921 with a stalemate and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, creating the Irish Free State, a Dominion within the British Empire, with effective internal independence but still constitutionally linked with the British Crown. Northern Ireland, consisting of six of the 32 Irish counties which had been established as a devolved region under the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, immediately exercised its option under the treaty to retain its existing status within the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Nine protesting prisoners contested {{the general}} {{election}} in the Republic of Ireland in June. Kieran Doherty and Paddy Agnew (who was not on hunger strike) were elected in Cavan–Monaghan and Louth respectively, and Joe McDonnell narrowly missed election in Sligo–Leitrim. There were also local elections in Northern Ireland around that time and, although Sinn Féin did not contest them, some smaller groups and independents who supported the hunger strikers gained seats, such as the Irish Independence Party with 21 seats, while <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>Republican</b> Socialist Party (the INLA's political wing) and People's Democracy (a Trotskyist group) gained two seats each, {{and a number of}} pro-hunger strike independent candidates also won seats. The British government rushed through the Representation of the People Act 1981 to prevent another prisoner contesting the second by-election in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, which was due to take place following the death of Sands.|$|E
5|$|Richard Edward O'Connor {{was born}} in the Sydney suburb of Glebe on 4 August 1851. His mother was Mary Anne, née Harnett, while his father was Richard, an Irish-born Catholic who at that time served as {{librarian}} to the New South Wales Legislative Council, and would later become Clerk of the Legislative Assembly, chairing its first meeting. His family believed itself to be descended from <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>republican</b> rebel Arthur O'Connor, and also counted the prominent Tasmanian pioneer Roderic O'Connor among their relations. Richard Edward, sometimes known as Dick, attended St Mary's College, a Benedictine school in Lyndhurst, from 1861 to 1866 before matriculating at Sydney Grammar School in 1867 and studying at the University of Sydney. From a young age his closest friend was Edmund Barton, in whose Cabinet O'Connor would later serve. He won the Wentworth medal for the best English essay in 1870, and received a Bachelor of Arts in 1871 and a Master of Arts in 1873.|$|E
