5|$|The Danish {{scientist}} Nicolas Steno (1669) pioneered experimental {{investigations of}} crystal symmetry. Steno {{showed that the}} angles between the faces are the same in every exemplar of {{a particular type of}} crystal, and René Just Haüy (1784) discovered that every face of a crystal can be described by simple stacking patterns of blocks of the same shape and size. Hence, William Hallowes Miller in 1839 was able to give each face a unique label of three small integers, the Miller indices which remain in use today for identifying crystal faces. Haüy's study led to the correct idea that crystals are a regular three-dimensional array (a Bravais lattice) of atoms and molecules; a single unit cell is repeated indefinitely along three principal directions that are not necessarily perpendicular. In the 19th century, a complete catalog of the possible symmetries of a crystal was worked out by Johan Hessel, Auguste Bravais, Evgraf Fedorov, Arthur Schönflies and (belatedly) William Barlow (1894). From <b>the</b> <b>available</b> <b>data</b> and physical reasoning, Barlow proposed several crystal structures in the 1880s that were validated later by X-ray crystallography; however, <b>the</b> <b>available</b> <b>data</b> were too scarce in the 1880s to accept his models as conclusive.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} Ceawlin ceased {{to hold the}} title of bretwalda, perhaps after a battle at Stoke Lyne, in Oxfordshire, which the Chronicle dates to 584, some eight years before he was deposed in 592 (again using the Chronicle's {{unreliable}} dating). Æthelberht certainly was a dominant ruler by 601, when Gregory the Great wrote to him: Gregory urges Æthelberht to spread Christianity among those kings and peoples subject to him, implying some level of overlordship.

5|$|The most {{frequently}} used methods to map and measure snow extent, snow depth and snow water equivalent employ multiple inputs on the visible–infrared spectrum to deduce the presence and properties of snow. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses the reflectance of visible and infrared radiation to calculate a normalized difference snow index, which is a ratio of radiation parameters that can distinguish between clouds and snow. Other researchers have developed decision trees, employing <b>the</b> <b>available</b> <b>data</b> to make more accurate assessments. One challenge to this assessment is where snow cover is patchy, for example during periods of accumulation or ablation and also in forested areas. Cloud cover inhibits optical sensing of surface reflectance, {{which has led to}} other methods for estimating ground conditions underneath clouds. For hydrological models, {{it is important to have}} continuous information about the snow cover. Passive microwave sensors are especially valuable for temporal and spatial continuity because they can map the surface beneath clouds and in darkness. When combined with reflective measurements, passive microwave sensing greatly extends the inferences possible about the snowpack.|$|E

5|$|The true {{number of}} cases of carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning is unknown, since many non-lethal exposures go undetected. From <b>the</b> <b>available</b> <b>data,</b> carbon monoxide poisoning is {{the most common cause of}} injury and death due to poisoning worldwide. Poisoning is typically more common during the winter months. This is due to increased domestic use of gas furnaces, gas or kerosene space heaters, and kitchen stoves during the winter months, which if faulty and/or used without adequate ventilation, may produce excessive carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide detection and poisoning also increases during power outages, when electric heating and cooking appliances become inoperative and residents may temporarily resort to fuel-burning space heaters, stoves, and grills (some of which are safe only for outdoor use but nonetheless are errantly burned indoors).|$|E
5|$|Note {{that these}} numbers are for the {{terrestrial}} surface and not really a global average. Whether dimming (or brightening) occurred over the ocean has {{been a bit of}} an unknown though a specific measurement (see below, Causes) measured effects some 400 miles (643.7km) from India over the Indian Ocean towards the Maldives Islands. Regional effects probably dominate but are not strictly confined to the land area, and the effects will be driven by regional air circulation. A 2009 review by Wild et al. found that widespread variation in regional and time effects. There was solar brightening beyond 2000 at numerous stations in Europe, the United States, and Korea. The brightening seen at sites in Antarctica during the 1990s, influenced by recovering from the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991, fades after 2000. The brightening tendency also seems to level off at sites in Japan. In China there is some indication for a renewed dimming, after the stabilization in the 1990s. A continuation of the long-lasting dimming is also noted at the sites in India. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>available</b> <b>data</b> suggest continuation of the brightening beyond the year 2000 at numerous locations, yet less pronounced and coherent than during the 1990s, with more regions with no clear changes or declines. Therefore, globally, greenhouse warming after 2000 may be less modulated by surface solar variations than in prior decades. The largest reductions are found in the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes. Visible light and infrared radiation seem to be most affected rather than the ultraviolet part of the spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Other historians, {{including}} Richard Abels, P. Grosjean, and Alan Thacker, {{state that}} Deusdedit died on 14 July 664. The main argument was {{put forward by}} Grosjean, who claimed that Bede had the consecration date wrong, as 26 May was Maundy Thursday in 655, not a date that would normally have been chosen for a consecration. Grosjean argues that the best method for resolving the conflicts is to just take 14July 664 as the date of death, and figure backwards with the length of reign given by Bede, which gives a consecration date of 12March 655. Thacker and Abels agree generally, although Thacker does not give a specific consecration date beyond March. Abels adds to Grosjean's arguments Bede's association of Deusdedit's death with that of King Eorcenberht, which Bede gives as occurring on the same day. Bede states that the plague of 664 began soon after the eclipse on 1May. Nothing in Bede contradicts the date of 14July 664 for Eorcenberht; therefore, Abels considers that date {{to be the best}} fit for <b>the</b> <b>available</b> <b>data.</b> The historian D. P. Kirby agrees that Deusdedit died in 664, although he does not give a precise date within that year.|$|E
