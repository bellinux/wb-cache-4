5|$|Boletus subluridellus is {{classified}} in the section Luridi of the genus Boletus. Section Luridi is characterized by boletes <b>that</b> <b>immediately</b> turn blue with cutting or bruising, narrow pores that are usually red, and the occasional presence of toxins in the fruit bodies. According to the scheme proposed by Smith and Thiers, {{the form of the}} dermatocystidia (cystidia on the cap cuticle) is important to species delimitation in section Luridi. In a 1993 study, however, Roland Treu found no major consistent microscopic differences between B.subluridellus, B.rufocinnamomeus, and B.roseobadius.|$|E
5|$|During {{the filming}} of Victory of Faith, Hitler had stood {{side by side with}} the leader of the Sturmabteilung (SA) Ernst Röhm, a man with whom he clearly had a close working relationship. Rohm was ruthlessly murdered on Hitler's orders a short time later during the purge of the SA {{referred}} to as the Night of the Long Knives. It has gone on record <b>that,</b> <b>immediately</b> following the killings, Hitler subsequently ordered all copies of the film to be destroyed, although Riefenstahl disputes that this ever happened.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the first}} series had aired {{and it was}} {{realised}} that the overall approach was working well, the creative team built on and significantly expanded {{the scope of the}} comedy elements for the second. This trend continued through each subsequent series. The net result was a show <b>that</b> <b>immediately</b> appealed to young children while also gaining the increasing respect—and viewership—of older audiences.|$|E

5|$|Police visited Brady {{in prison}} again {{and told him}} of Hindley's confession, which at first he refused to believe. Once {{presented}} {{with some of the}} details that Hindley had provided of Pauline Reade's abduction, Brady decided that he too was prepared to confess, but on one condition: <b>that</b> <b>immediately</b> afterwards he be given the means to commit suicide, a request with which it was impossible for the authorities to comply.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church teaches <b>that,</b> <b>immediately</b> after death, {{the soul}} of each person will receive a {{particular}} judgement from God, based on their sins {{and their relationship to}} Christ. This teaching also attests to another day when Christ will sit in universal judgement of all mankind. This final judgement, according to the church's teaching, will bring an end to human history and mark the beginning of both a new and better heaven and earth ruled by God in righteousness.|$|E
5|$|The Mahans {{typically}} had {{a tripod}} foremast with a pole mainmast. To improve the anti-aircraft field of fire, their tripod foremast was constructed without nautical rigging. In silhouette, they {{were similar to}} the larger s <b>that</b> <b>immediately</b> preceded them. The Mahans were fitted with the first emergency generators, replacing the storage batteries of earlier classes. Gun crew shelters were built for the superimposed weapons, one shelter before the bridge and one atop the shelter deck aft.|$|E

5|$|The {{size of the}} pre-Reform {{electorate}} {{is difficult}} to estimate. Voter registration was lacking, and many boroughs were rarely contested in elections. It is estimated <b>that</b> <b>immediately</b> before the 1832 Reform Act, 400,000 English subjects were entitled to vote, and that after passage, the number rose to 650,000, an increase of more than 60%.|$|E
5|$|Edgar Quinet {{continued}} her {{service in the}} eastern Mediterranean {{after the end of}} the war in 1918. During the culmination of the Greco-Turkish War <b>that</b> <b>immediately</b> followed World War I, Edgar Quinet rescued 1,200 people from the Great Fire of Smyrna in 1922. In 1925, Edgar Quinet was converted into a training ship. The work lasted until 1927, and included the reduction of her armament to ten of her 194mm guns, the removal of two of her funnels, and a reconstruction of her bridge. Then-Captain François Darlan commanded the ship in 1928. In 1929, Edgar Quinet underwent an overhaul; during this modernization she was fitted with equipment to handle floatplanes for reconnaissance purposes. After returning to service, the ship was assigned as a training ship for cadets from the École Navale (Naval Academy). On 4 January 1930, Edgar Quinet ran aground off the coast of Algeria west of Oran and proved to be a total loss. She sank five days later.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, Spike Albrecht had offseason {{surgery on}} his right hip to correct for a genetic {{condition}} that may also necessitate left hip surgery. Following the 2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament several pollsters (including ESPN, USA Today, NBC Sports) omitted Michigan from the expected preseason top 25, however some <b>that</b> <b>immediately</b> projected Caris LeVert to return to Michigan included Michigan in the rankings: CBS Sports (#18) and Sports Illustrated (#16). Bleacher Report ranked Michigan at 25 noting lower expectations if LeVert declared himself eligible for the 2015 NBA draft. On April 21, LeVert {{announced that he would}} return for his senior season. That same day, Max Bielfeldt was released from his athletic scholarship with one year of eligibility remaining. Despite all 13 of its scholarships being committed at the time, Michigan continued to recruit five-star 2015 McDonald's All-American Jaylen Brown and four-star Kenny Williams for the class of 2015.|$|E

5|$|It was {{observed}} <b>that</b> <b>immediately</b> after going to bed, generally at about 8:00pm, Domery {{would begin to}} sweat profusely. After one to two hours lying awake and perspiring, he would fall asleep before waking at around 1:00am extremely hungry, regardless {{of what he had}} eaten before going to bed. At this time, he would eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00am he would go back to sleep, and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00am, sweating heavily; {{as soon as he got}} out of bed, the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.|$|E
5|$|Ramudu meets a Nepali sorcerer {{during the}} latter's magic {{show in a}} street. The sorcerer, who is ordered by Goddess Pathala Bhairavi during his prayers to {{sacrifice}} an intelligent and brave young man before her to be granted a statuette which grants any wish, feels that Ramudu is suitable for the sacrifice. While taking a holy bath in the nearby pond, Ramudu kills a crocodile <b>that</b> <b>immediately</b> transforms into a woman after being killed. The woman informs Ramudu that he had freed her from a hermit's curse and also reveals the sorcerer's intentions. Just before the sacrifice, Ramudu sacrifices the sorcerer and wins the statuette, consequently amassing the wealth {{equal to that of}} the king. In return, the king lives up to his promise and accepts Indu's wishes to marry Ramudu.|$|E
5|$|The La3+ ion is similarly-sized to {{the early}} {{lanthanides}} of the cerium group (those up to samarium and europium) <b>that</b> <b>immediately</b> follow in the periodic table, and hence it tends to occur along with them in phosphate, silicate and carbonate minerals, such as monazite (MIIIPO4) and bastnäsite (MIIICO3F), where M refers to all the rare earth metals except scandium and the radioactive promethium (mostly Ce, La, and Y). Bastnäsite is usually lacking in thorium and the heavy lanthanides, and the purification of the light lanthanides from it is less involved. The ore, after being crushed and ground, is first treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid, evolving carbon dioxide, hydrogen fluoride, and silicon tetrafluoride: the product is then dried and leached with water, leaving the early lanthanide ions, including lanthanum, in solution.|$|E

5|$|The Pr3+ ion {{is similar}} in size to the early {{lanthanides}} of the cerium group (those from lanthanum up to samarium and europium) <b>that</b> <b>immediately</b> follow in the periodic table, and hence it tends to occur along with them in phosphate, silicate and carbonate minerals, such as monazite (MIIIPO4) and bastnäsite (MIIICO3F), where M refers to all the rare-earth metals except scandium and the radioactive promethium (mostly Ce, La, and Y, with somewhat less Nd and Pr). Bastnäsite is usually lacking in thorium and the heavy lanthanides, and the purification of the light lanthanides from it is less involved. The ore, after being crushed and ground, is first treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid, evolving carbon dioxide, hydrogen fluoride, and silicon tetrafluoride.

5|$|The trends {{going down}} from {{scandium}} and yttrium to lanthanum {{tend to be}} more similar to those going down groups 1 and 2 in the periodic table, while those going down from scandium and yttrium to lutetium {{tend to be more}} similar to those in the early transition metals. Since Sc3+, Y3+, and La3+ still have a low enough charge for their compounds to be predominantly ionic, unlike Ti4+, Zr4+, and Hf4+, {{it has been argued that}} lanthanum and the rest of group 3 should be considered at best atypical transition metals, as their chemistry is focused on the predominantly ionic +3 state and they have a low ability to form coordination compounds or organometallic compounds. Indeed, lanthanum is a strongly electropositive metal, comparable to calcium in electropositivity. The rare earth metals in general are more similar in reactivity to the alkaline earth metals <b>that</b> <b>immediately</b> precede them than to the transition metals proper which follow them.|$|E
5|$|With the Eastern Front {{entering}} Polish territories in 1944, the Home Army {{established an}} uneasy truce with the Soviets. Even so, the main Red Army and NKVD forces conducted operations against Home Army partisans, including during or directly after Poland's Operation Tempest, which the Poles had envisioned to be a joint Polish-Soviet operation against the retreating Germans which would also establish Polish claims to those territories. The Home Army helped Soviet units with scouting assistance, uprisings, and assistance in liberating some cities (e.g., Operation Ostra Brama in Vilnius, and the Lwów Uprising), {{only to find}} <b>that</b> <b>immediately</b> afterwards Home Army troops were arrested, imprisoned–even executed. Unknown to the Poles, their Operation Tempest had been fatally flawed from the start due to Joseph Stalin's intention of ensuring that an independent Poland would never re-emerge after the war.|$|E
