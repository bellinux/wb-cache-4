5|$|Europa is the smoothest known {{object in}} the Solar System, lacking {{large-scale}} features such as mountains and craters. However; according to one theory, Europa's equator may be covered in icy spikes called penitentes, which may be up to ten meters high, due to direct overhead sunlight on the equator, causing the ice to sublime forming vertical cracks. The prominent markings crisscrossing Europa appear to mainly be albedo features <b>that</b> <b>emphasize</b> low topography. There are few craters on Europa, because its surface is tectonically too active and therefore young. Europa's icy crust has an albedo (light reflectivity) of 0.64, {{one of the highest}} of all moons. This indicates a young and active surface, based on estimates of the frequency of cometary bombardment that Europa likely experiences, the surface is about 20 to 180 million years old. There is currently no full scientific consensus among the sometimes contradictory explanations for the surface features of Europa.|$|E
