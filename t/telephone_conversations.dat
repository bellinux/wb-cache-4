5|$|Analogue {{filters are}} a basic {{building}} block of signal processing much used in electronics. Amongst their many applications are the separation of an audio signal before application to bass, mid-range and tweeter loudspeakers; the combining and later separation of multiple <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> onto a single channel; {{the selection of a}} chosen radio station in a radio receiver and rejection of others.|$|E
5|$|Black {{adopted a}} {{narrower}} {{interpretation of the}} Fourth Amendment than {{many of his colleagues}} on the Warren Court. He dissented from Katz v. United States (1967), in which the Court held that warrantless wiretapping violated the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure. He argued that the Fourth Amendment only protected tangible items from physical searches or seizures. Thus, he concluded that <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> were not within the scope of the amendment, and that warrantless wiretapping was consequently permissible.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} Popular Contemporary Writers, Michael D. Sharp {{describes}} Vonnegut's linguistic style as straightforward; his sentences concise, his language simple, his paragraphs brief, and his ordinary tone conversational. Vonnegut uses this style to convey normally complex subject matter {{in a way}} that is intelligible to a large audience. He credited his time as a journalist for his ability, pointing to his work with the Chicago City News Bureau, which required him to convey stories in <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations.</b> Vonnegut's compositions are also laced with distinct references to his own life, notably in Slaughterhouse-Five and Slapstick.|$|E

5|$|Once {{considered}} {{for the role of}} James Bond in the cinematic adaptations of Ian Fleming's novels, Lucan was known for his expensive tastes; he raced power boats and drove an Aston Martin. In 1963 he married Veronica Duncan, by whom he had three children. When the marriage collapsed late in 1972, he moved out of the family home at 46Lower Belgrave Street, in London's Belgravia, to a property nearby. A bitter custody battle ensued, which Lucan lost. He began to spy on his wife and record their <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations,</b> apparently obsessed with regaining custody of the children. This fixation, combined with his gambling losses, had a dramatic effect on his life and personal finances.|$|E
5|$|The Parsons family spent mid-1929 {{on a tour}} of Europe before {{returning}} to Pasadena, where they moved into a house on San Rafael Avenue. With the onset of the Great Depression their fortune began to dwindle, and in July 1931 Jack's grandfather Walter died. Parsons began studying at the privately run University School, a liberal institution that took an unconventional approach to teaching. He flourished academically, becoming editor of the school's newspaper El Universitano and winning an award for literary excellence; teachers who had trained at the nearby California Institute of Technology (Caltech) honed his attentions on the study of chemistry. With the family's financial difficulties deepening, Parsons began working during weekends and school holidays at the offices of the Hercules Powder Company, where he learned more about explosives and their potential use in rocket propulsion. He and Forman continued to independently explore the subject in their spare time, building and testing different rockets, sometimes with materials that Parsons had stolen from work. Parsons soon constructed a solid-fuel rocket engine, and with Forman corresponded with pioneer rocket engineers including Robert H. Goddard, Hermann Oberth, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Willy Ley and Wernher von Braun. Parsons and von Braun had hours of <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> about rocketry in their respective countries as well as their own research.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, Middleton {{made the}} {{decision}} to release recordings of the <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> Johnson made throughout his presidency. Although Johnson had stipulated that the recordings be sealed until 50 years after his death (the year 2023), Middleton consulted with the President's widow, Lady Bird Johnson, about releasing them sooner, and she said the decision was his to make. The conversations, most of which were recorded on a Dictaphone machine, cover a variety of issues, including foreign policy, the Vietnam War and peace negotiations, legislation, civil rights, the economy, politics, labor issues, appointments, and press relations. Consequently, 642 hours of secretly taped <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> have been made available to the public, providing insight into Johnson's legislative skills and substantially elevating his standing among past presidents.|$|E

25|$|The Post Office {{commenced}} its telephone {{business in}} 1878, however {{the vast majority}} of telephones were initially connected to independently run networks. In December 1880, the Post Master General obtained a court judgement that <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> were, technically, within the remit of the Telegraph Act. The General Post Office then licensed all existing telephone networks.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} {{made no attempt}} to defend the methods employed by federal agents, and, in fact, conceded that if wiretapping could be deemed a search or seizure, such wiretapping as took place in this case would be unreasonable search and seizure and thus inadmissible in court. However, it claimed that the protections of the amendment do not extend to <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations.</b>|$|E
25|$|Brandeis {{attacks the}} {{proposition}} that expanding the Fourth Amendment to include protection of <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> was inappropriate. At {{the time of the}} adoption of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, he writes, “force and violence” were the only means by which the government could compel self-incrimination. Thus, the protections offered by these Amendments were necessarily limited to address only imaginable forms of such force and violence.|$|E

She was hired during Clinton's first term in 1995 as an intern at the White House and was later an employee of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs.

25|$|In June {{the cabinet}} Michelsen {{unilaterally}} dissolved the union with Sweden. The summer of 1905 saw a Swedish reaction, coercing Norway to undergo negotiations in Karlstad. Castberg opposed the resulting Karlstad Treaty. In his diaries, {{he wrote that}} opponents of the Karlstad negotiations underwent censorship. Pamphlets were confiscated, and <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> regarding the negotiations were sometimes interrupted. While a plebiscite on accepting Prince Carl of Denmark as King of Norway was held in November 1905, Castberg advocated the Republican form of government. In the plebiscite, Prince Carl was accepted with a 78.9% majority.|$|E
25|$|Telephone {{headsets}} {{connect to}} a fixed-line telephone system. A telephone headset functions by replacing the handset of a telephone. Headsets for standard corded telephones are {{fitted with a}} standard 4P4C commonly called an RJ-9 connector. Headsets are also available with 2.5mm jack sockets for many DECT phones and other applications. Cordless bluetooth headsets are available, and often used with mobile telephones. Headsets are widely used for telephone-intensive jobs, in particular by call centre workers. They are also used by anyone wishing to hold <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> with both hands free.|$|E
