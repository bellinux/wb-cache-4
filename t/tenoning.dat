50|$|The Cray House, {{located on}} Cockey Lane, {{is the most}} {{complete}} example of post-and-plank construction known to exist. John Denny purchased the lot from J. Stevens in 1809. Denny, a ship carpenter, used a construction method in which walls are formed by <b>tenoning</b> horizontal planks into slots cut into vertical corner posts. After a series of owners, it was sold at auction in 1914 to Nora Cray, a widow who lived there with her three children. Nora Cray's heirs deeded the property to The Kent Island Heritage Society in 1976, {{and the house was}} restored in 2004.

50|$|Generally {{the size}} of the mortise and <b>tenon</b> is related to the {{thickness}} of the timbers. It is considered good practice to proportion the <b>tenon</b> as one third the thickness of the rail, or as close to this as is practical.

The remaining two-thirds of the rail, the <b>tenon</b> shoulders, help to counteract lateral forces that might tweak the <b>tenon</b> from the mortise, contributing to its strength. These also serve to hide imperfections in the opening of the mortise.|$|R

Polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) adhesive was utilized in constructing joint specimens. Totally 100 T-type joints were made and tested in the same way. The results showed that the difference between the groups was highly significant in terms of shoulder thickness, loose <b>tenon</b> length, and width of loose <b>tenon.</b> Shoulder thickness directly affected bending moment capacity of joint. The highest bending moment capacity was obtained in joints with 1. 5 mm shoulder thickness.

30|$|In China, {{there are}} many ancient timber {{buildings}} [1, 2]. The wooden frameworks provide the using spaces and constitute the load-bearing skeletons. The typical feature of the ancient timber frames in China lies in the natural connection mode of the joints without a metal nail or bolt. These connections mainly include the straight <b>tenon</b> joints (Fig.  1 a) and the dovetail joints (Fig.  1 b). The straight <b>tenon</b> joint is formed by inserting the <b>tenon</b> {{at the end of}} a beam into the mortise opened in a column from the side surface of a column. The mortise used to contain the dovetail <b>tenon</b> must be opened at the top end of a column to ensure that the <b>tenon</b> can be embedded into mortise easily. Frames connected with such joints are typical of semi-rigid characteristics.|$|R
50|$|The mortise and <b>tenon</b> joint {{has been}} used for {{thousands}} of years by woodworkers around the world to join pieces of wood, mainly when the adjoining pieces connect at an angle of 90°. In its basic form it is both simple and strong. Although there are many joint variations, the basic mortise and <b>tenon</b> comprises two components: the mortise hole and the <b>tenon</b> tongue. The <b>tenon,</b> formed {{on the end of a}} member generally referred to as a rail, is inserted into a square or rectangular hole cut into the corresponding member. The <b>tenon</b> is cut to fit the mortise hole exactly and usually has shoulders that seat when the joint fully enters the mortise hole. The joint may be glued, pinned, or wedged to lock it in place.|$|R

30|$|In recent years, some {{achievements}} about traditional timber {{frames and}} mortise and <b>tenon</b> joints {{have been obtained}} [7]. Related test results showed significant nonlinearity and inelasticity in the load–displacement curves and the moment–rotation relationships under both static and cyclic lateral load [2, 8 – 10]. Many research works about the stiffness properties of the mortise and <b>tenon</b> joints were conducted as well [11]. For example, Pan et al. [12] and Xie et al. [13] discussed the mechanical mechanism of the straight <b>tenon</b> joints and dovetail joints, respectively. Wood shrinkage or loading history induced gap at the mortise and <b>tenon</b> joint was researched by Chang et al. [14, 15], and Ogawa et al. [16] to investigate the influence of such insufficient contact on the mechanical performance of the joints. Despite so many research about the wooden frames and the associated mortise and <b>tenon</b> joints, they all regarding the friction coefficient between mortise and <b>tenon</b> as a constant, failing to model the contact behavior efficiently and reveal the corresponding frictional mechanism.|$|R
50|$|In {{traditional}} {{timber frame}} joinery, mortises and <b>tenons</b> were typically two {{inches wide and}} two inches {{from the edge of}} the timber when working with softwoods, giving rise to the width of the blade. Likewise, mortises and <b>tenons</b> were traditionally one and a half inches wide when working in hardwoods, explaining the width of the tongue. This allowed for quick layouts of mortise and <b>tenon</b> joints when working both hard and softwoods.|$|R
30|$|With {{the lateral}} load applied on the column (Fig.  2 a) gradually, the {{distance}} between the top and bottom surfaces of the mortise in the column is getting increasingly close with the top and bottom surfaces of the <b>tenon.</b> The forces that hinder the relative displacement of the mortise and <b>tenon</b> are gradually arising. When the mentioned surfaces are in contact, they start to transfer the occurred normal stress and tangential stress between the mortise and <b>tenon.</b> The interaction conditions of the joint during the pulling-out of the <b>tenon</b> from the mortise are complicated and parts of the contact surface pairs (CSP) can be clearly seen from Fig.  2 b. The Ι type CSP (CSP-Ι) is the most direct contact surface, which represents the friction area between the transverse section of the mortise and the tangential section of the <b>tenon.</b> CSP-ΙΙ, another contact surface existing in the joint area, represents the friction area between the transverse section of the beam and the tangential section of the column. CSP-ΙΙΙ represents the lateral friction surface pair between the mortise and <b>tenon,</b> the friction between the tangential section of the mortise and the tangential section of the <b>tenon,</b> which cannot be directly seen from Fig.  2 b. Overall, the friction mechanism of the mortise and <b>tenon</b> can fully be reflected by the friction behavior between transverse and tangential sections as well as the transverse and transverse sections of wood. The corresponding mechanical parameters in the following established theoretical model are equally related with the mentioned wood surfaces.|$|R
