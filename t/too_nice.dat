5|$|Another major {{challenge}} {{that came up}} in production was who Monk's new psychiatrist would be. Several ideas included a woman, someone too strict or <b>too</b> <b>nice,</b> someone driven crazy by Monk's compulsions, and even someone who would give Monk scream therapy. The eventual decision came from writer Jonathan Collier, who suggested a one-armed psychiatrist. Shalhoub liked the idea, but required that they recruit an actual one-armed actor to play Dr. Sorenson. The Screen Actors Guild actually had several actors waiting to audition, and the part was given to Rick Curry.|$|E
5|$|Earlier on I {{tried to}} include people {{as much as}} possible. Then I {{realised}} the magic is me really prying stuff {{out of my head}} and getting it on to tape, and that stuff doesn't happen unless I'm completely alone. Sometimes it's about the right amount of blood sugar, just slightly hungover. And I'm really affected by the weather. If it's <b>too</b> <b>nice</b> outside it's insane for me, the concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology versus nature thing and if it's anything that is it: look who my best friends are, a bunch of plastic and circuitry and electricity, when I should be running around getting chased by bumblebees.|$|E

25|$|Costas' {{decision}} to be positive rather than negative has been viewed by some in both political parties as a weakness, a lack of the killer instinct. Some have said that Costas is <b>too</b> <b>nice</b> to be a politician. Some have charged {{that it was a}} political mistake not to go after the mayor (Butterfield) on the Pratt deal when Costas had the chance. Maybe. We'll never know if Costas might have won if he had been a more typical political campaigner.|$|E
25|$|Although he wasn't {{fired for}} the failure of the task, Sir Alan criticised Tim for his {{constant}} complimentary attitude, especially due to the fact of him being in the firing line as project manager, while also accusing him of digging a hole for himself and being <b>too</b> <b>nice.</b> Until Adele's resignation, Tim was also warned that his complimentary attitude should stop shortly because {{he would not be able}} to compliment anyone when he was asked to bring two people back into the final three.|$|E
500|$|Judgements {{were mixed}} on Yardley's {{performance}} as Yorkshire's captain. His record {{would have been}} considered good at any other county, but not by the standards set by previous Yorkshire sides. Critics felt that Yorkshire should have won the Championship with the players available. Contemporaries believed him to be the best captain in the country tactically, taking reasonable chances without too many risks and judging players strengths and weakness. Trevor Bailey, who played against him for Essex and under him for England, wrote that he thought him [...] "an outstanding tactician and an expert on wicket behaviour. He was unquestionably one of the best captains I have ever played with or against. It has been said that he was <b>too</b> <b>nice</b> to lead Yorkshire, but I cannot think of anybody I have preferred playing under." [...] Alan Gibson believed that unlike some county captains, Yardley was worth his place in the side on cricketing ability. However, he seemed unable to extract the best from his players. Jim Kilburn noted that he used orthodox tactics, even when a different approach was called for, while other critics believed that he was shocked by the attitude of some difficult players in the side. Neither Yardley nor Hutton, his senior professional, were disciplinarians in the dressing room and kept apart from others. Both were frequently absent, playing in representative matches. This may have inflamed the situation, leading to accusations that some players were out of control. Yardley disliked confrontation, and Ray Illingworth, who played under him, described him as <b>too</b> <b>nice</b> to stand up to his players. But Bob Appleyard, another of his former players, gives Yardley credit for recognising his potential and encouraging him to become a spinner, and believes that he and Hutton made a formidable pair of tacticians. Generally, he was popular with his players.|$|E

500|$|Donop, who despised Rall, was {{reluctant}} to give command of Trenton to him. Rall {{was known to be}} loud and unacquainted with the English language, but he was also a 36-year soldier {{with a great deal of}} battle experience. His request for reinforcements had been turned down by British commander General James Grant, who disdained the American rebels and thought them poor soldiers. [...] Despite Rall's experience, the Hessians at Trenton did not admire their commander. They believed that he was <b>too</b> <b>nice,</b> and not ruthless enough to be successful. His officers complained, [...] "His love of life was too great, a thought came to him, then another, so he could not settle on a firm decision..." [...] Rall avoided hard work and had little concern for his troops' comfort.|$|E
500|$|Clapton, in a {{separate}} interview, was also asked about the meaning and representation of Cersei's crown, saying [...] "I chose {{to make it in}} silver with just wisps of gold to try to show her isolation, her mental disentangling from her family. There is no reference to Baratheon; there is no need anymore. She doesn't have to try and prove a link. The center of the crown is the lion sigil abstracted — its mane represents the Iron Throne, her desire. She has made it her own — she is reborn." [...] Clapton revealed as well that King Tommen Baratheon's costume was intended to show how heavily his responsibilities weigh on him, as he is weighted down with jeweled finery, with Clapton saying [...] "He was a nice boy. <b>Too</b> <b>nice</b> for this." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, {{set in the}} Los Angeles underworld. The {{film was}} not well {{received}} by critics; Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert noted that Jolie [...] "finds a certain warmth {{in a kind of}} role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems <b>too</b> <b>nice</b> to be [...] girlfriend, and maybe she is." [...] Her next work, as a frontierswoman in the CBS miniseries True Women (1997), was even less successful; writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Robert Strauss dismissed her as [...] "horrid, a fourth-rate Scarlett O'Hara" [...] who relies on [...] "gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips." [...] Jolie also starred in the music video for the Rolling Stones's [...] "Anybody Seen My Baby?" [...] as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City.|$|E

She said, [...] "I don't care much for the other judges...Ronan thinks he knows it all [...] Natalie is just <b>too</b> <b>nice</b> and really dishonest. Guy could just be boring, like 'get on with it. Keep it moving, brother.'" [...] During a radio interview with The Kyle and Jackie O Show on 29 August 2011, Bassingthwaighte responded to Mel B's comments saying, [...] "I think it's in fun – I hope so otherwise she deserves a slap."

500|$|Gill {{signed a}} two-and-a-half-year {{contract}} in January 2001. Having {{taken part in}} most of the games in Birmingham's League Cup run, he was omitted from the first leg of the semi-final at Ipswich Town in favour of loan player Steve Jenkins. When Jenkins returned to his owning club, Gary Rowett said that Gill should be given a run of games in the Birmingham first team, suggesting that [...] "if anything, he's <b>too</b> <b>nice.</b> He doesn't complain a lot and it's easy for people not to take notice of you. Perhaps if he moaned a bit more he'd get a start!" [...] Recalled for the second leg, he produced an excellent performance, making a goal-line clearance from a header which would have left Birmingham two goals adrift had it crossed the line. Yet {{when it came to the}} final, manager Francis was unable to find a place for Gill even among the substitutes, preferring Eaden and McCarthy, making only his second start after recovering from a broken leg, in the starting eleven and David Holdsworth, a defender unavailable since the previous November due to serious illness, on the bench. Gill was devastated by this decision, describing it as [...] "the biggest disappointment of [...] whole life".|$|E
500|$|During {{production}} of Supernaturals first season, Morgan was {{also working on}} the shows Weeds and Grey's Anatomy, so he was often traveling {{back and forth between}} Los Angeles and Vancouver, British Columbia. This interfered at times with Morgan's acting, as he had trouble getting [...] "Winchester-y enough" [...] after portraying the nice character of Denny Duquette on Grey's Anatomy. Morgan commented, [...] "I was stuck in Denny-land, where I was being <b>too</b> <b>nice.</b> Winchester's harder to find. Denny's more me. He's an intense guy, John is. And Denny, for a guy who's having trouble living, he's just a charming dude." [...] Morgan was at first reluctant to return for Supernaturals second season due to his role on Grey's Anatomy. Although he lent his voice for the third season episode [...] "Long-Distance Call," [...] future appearances of Morgan as the character after the second season have been hindered due to the actor's busy schedule. Nevertheless, both Kripke and writer Sera Gamble have stated that they [...] "would love to have him back." [...] The scheduling conflict has continued into the sixth season of Supernatural, with executive producer Robert Singer revealing that the writers had considered bringing the character back in the alternate reality episode [...] "My Heart Will Go On" [...] instead of Ellen Harvelle, but due to concerns {{that they would not be}} able to secure Morgan's return, they ultimately chose Ellen for the deceased character they would have (temporarily) return in the episode. During the {{production of}} the fifth season, Morgan had an interview with MovieWeb in which he stated that no one from the show had contacted him about making another appearance, and expressed the desire to return for at least one more episode in what was then-believed to be the show's final season, as he had enjoying working with on-screen sons Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki and he felt that John's storyline had ended too soon.|$|E

2500|$|Norwegian {{magazine}} Rock Furore {{published an}} interview with Vikernes in February 1993. In it, {{he said of the}} prison system: [...] "It's much <b>too</b> <b>nice</b> here.

Her coach, Keith Hennig, a former player at Central Washington University who is 6inches taller than Vandersloot, regularly played one-on-one against her either {{before or after}} the team's practice. He would later say, [...] "I did not take it easy on her at all. I was more physical than anything she's ever been used to. At times, I wasn't <b>too</b> <b>nice.</b> I would ride her and foul her. I'd put my hand in her face and she would whine and complain about fouls. I'd say, 'There's no fouls out here.'

2500|$|Cashman {{decided to}} quit the show {{in the early part}} of 1989. While still on the cast of EastEnders, Cashman had founded the {{influential}} gay campaign group Stonewall and has now given up acting to become a Labour MEP. He was elected to the European Parliament in 1999 where he is the Labour spokesperson on human rights. He is also an active campaigner across a wide range of issues. On screen, Colin finally learned he had multiple sclerosis and decided to leave Walford to live with his brother and face a rapid decline in health. In an interview featured in EastEnders Handbook by Hilary Kingsly, Michael Cashman looked back fondly on Albert Square and his character, commenting: [...] "Quite a few gay activists thought Colin <b>too</b> <b>nice,</b> but I thought he was just right. There was a fuss about his kiss with Barry which was sad — people should be upset by demonstrations of hate, not love".|$|E
2500|$|On 14 April, in the Commons, Powell claimed [...] "it is {{difficult}} to fault the military and especially the naval measures which the Government have taken". He added: [...] "We are in some danger of resting our position too exclusively upon the existence, the nature and {{the wishes of the}} inhabitants of the Falkland Islands... if the population of the Falkland Islands did not desire to be British, the principle that the Queen wishes no unwilling subjects would long ago have prevailed; but we should create great difficulties for ourselves in other contexts, as well as in this context, if we rested our action purely and exclusively on the notion of restoring tolerable, acceptable conditions and self-determination to our fellow Britons on the Falkland Islands.... I do not think that we need be <b>too</b> <b>nice</b> about saying that we defend our territory as well as our people. There is nothing irrational, nothing to be ashamed of, in doing that. Indeed, it is impossible in the last resort to distinguish between the defence of territory and the defence of people".|$|E
2500|$|Seuss {{reportedly}} had {{misgivings about}} The Seven Lady Godivas before its publication; the {{drawing on the}} endpaper contains a small bucket of sap labeled [...] "Bennett Cerf," [...] the name of Seuss's publisher at Random House. Seuss, by calling Cerf a sap, was apparently implying that Cerf was being <b>too</b> <b>nice</b> in allowing the book to be published. The initial 1939 publishing had a print run of 10,000 copies, but only around 2,500 sold. (One authority states that only 50 were sold.) Seuss himself called it his [...] "greatest failure" [...] and [...] "a book that nobody bought". To another interviewer he said [...] "It was all full of naked women, and I can't draw convincing naked women. I put their knees in the wrong places." [...] It became {{one of only two}} Dr Seuss books, along with The Cat in the Hat Songbook, to be allowed to go out of print. The remaining copies were remaindered in the chain of Schulte's Cigar Stores for twenty-five cents, though original editions now have been reported as selling at prices as high as $300.|$|E
