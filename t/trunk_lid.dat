In its most patriotic or flamboyant factory trim The Machine was painted white featured bold red, white, and blue reflective stripes (made by 3M) on the bodysides that wrapped over the <b>trunk</b> <b>lid.</b>|$|E
25|$|The AMC Cavalier {{featured}} a minimal amount of ornamentation compared to contemporary production cars, but was comparable to popular foreign makes as AMC {{was interested in}} marketing the car overseas. Utility was enhanced with dual-action scissor-type hinges on the deck lid {{so it could be}} opened like a normal <b>trunk</b> <b>lid,</b> or elevated to the height of the car's roof to accommodate tall, large, and bulky items in the trunk area.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} was a Cassini hallmark featuring a special black fabric with copper metal {{buttons on the}} individual adjustable and reclining front seats and on the padded door panels, that was set off by extra thick copper carpeting. Additional copper accents were on the steering wheel, door pulls, and on the instrument panel. Embroidered Cassini medallions were featured on the headrests. The glove compartment door, <b>trunk</b> <b>lid,</b> front fender, and hood featured Cassini's signature.|$|E
5000|$|Total {{production}} equaled 2,996 {{including two}} prototype convertibles. [...] While on later models it was purely for decoration the Mark II {{did in fact}} carry the spare under the <b>trunk</b> <b>lid's</b> stamped-in tire cover.|$|R

The composite is also in place for the mirror covers. Finally, there’s the requisite Super Snake racing stripes and external badging.|$|E
25|$|The 2010, 2012, and 2013 models lacked an {{interior}} trunk release mechanism. The trunk was only accessible using the key fob (Remote Keyless Entry) or a touch sensor between the <b>trunk</b> <b>lid</b> and the license plate. The 2011 year model added a remote release button {{at the left}} of the steering wheel on the instrument panel. The 2014 model refresh returned the trunk release button to LaCrosse but placed it on the driver door.|$|E
25|$|The Trabant had a steel unibody frame, {{with the}} roof, <b>trunk</b> <b>lid,</b> hood, fenders and doors made of Duroplast, a hard plastic made from {{recycled}} cotton waste from the Soviet Union and phenol resins from the East German dye industry. It was the second car with a body made of recycled material; {{the first was the}} AWZ P70 Zwickau, produced from 1955 to 1959. The material was durable, and the average lifespan of a Trabant was 28 years.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1993 model year, the Crown Victoria {{was given}} a chrome front grille and a [...] strip between the taillights.

25|$|The {{new body}} also {{featured}} a double shell roof for improved roll-over protection. Also new for '71 was a flow-through ventilation system utilizing vents {{mounted in the}} trunklid shared with other full-sized GM cars and the compact Chevrolet Vega. It used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the <b>trunk</b> <b>lid</b> or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.|$|E
25|$|Also new for the 1971 Electra 225, {{as well as}} the B-body LeSabre and Centurion, and E-body Riviera, was a {{new power}} {{ventilation}} system. The system, shared with other GM B-, C- and E-body cars along with the compact Chevrolet Vega, used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the <b>trunk</b> <b>lid</b> or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.|$|E
2500|$|The front {{nose was}} {{redesigned}} with slimmer headlights, while retaining the first generation's [...] "bottom breather" [...] nose, albeit {{in a more}} aerodynamically efficient design that flowed into the front bumper. In the rear, it received new taillights that closely resembled those of the previous generation, {{as well as an}} entirely new rear clip. The trunk was also redesigned, with a spoiler being integrated into the <b>trunk</b> <b>lid's</b> design to make the car more aerodynamically efficient.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the final}} years of its {{existence}} the CSP fleet consisted of white Dodge Diplomats, then Chevrolet Caprices and finally Ford Crown Victorias with a large green and gold stripe running the length of the car. On the <b>trunk</b> <b>lids</b> in gold with green trim were the words “State Police". On each driver and front passenger door was a large seven-point gold-star badge with the State Capitol on the center seal. The words [...] "State Police" [...] in gold with green trim were on the front fenders.|$|R
50|$|Lead sleds {{were and}} are {{designed}} for artistic style and expression and not for speed. Among the first customized cars referred to as Lead Sleds were built by Harry Westergard in Sacramento, California. Westergard modified over a dozen cars ranging from a 1931 Model A Ford roadster to two 1947 Chevrolets. He used lead extensively to fill openings in doors, hoods and <b>trunk</b> <b>lids</b> and adapt front ends to accommodate grills from more expensive cars such as Buicks, LaSalles and Packards and in the extension of front fenders. Upgraded bumpers and bumper wraparounds were also common with the ribbed DeSoto bumper and '49 Chevy license guard favored on Westergard Lead Sleds from the 1930s or 1940s.|$|R
25|$|Externally the 1972 {{model was}} the same as the 1971 model, {{retaining}} the same front end but with 3 vertical strips added to the grille. The chrome <b>trunk</b> <b>lid</b> strip and rear corner chrome of the 1970 Rebel and 1971 Marador was dropped. The rear bumper again was the 1970 Rebel bumper but with a new lens assembly with each assembly divided into nine recessed vertically rectangular lenses. Interior-wise the 1972 model saw the return of the round instrument dials of earlier Ambassador and 1967 Rebel models. The steering wheel {{was the same}} as previous models. New for the 1972 model was slimmer arm rests for the doors and a bench seat without the fold-down centre armrests.|$|E
25|$|Valiants, {{which were}} {{assembled}} {{and sold in}} Mexico from 1963 through 1976, were essentially the same A-body models as their US counterparts with minor differences. The Mexican Valiant lineup included a unique 2-door hardtop produced from 1967 to 1969 called the Acapulco named after the costal resort city. Based on a V200 Signet, the Acapulco was only sold locally in Latin America. The most notable features included a cobra snakeskin vinyl roof and emblems of Acaplulco in the interior and on the <b>trunk</b> <b>lid.</b> Other features included bucket seats, upgraded interior and remote controlled passenger side mirrors. The car was powered by 2bbl 225 Slant-6 which was being used concurrently in the Australian market; the manual transmission was operated by a four-on-the-floor Hurst gearshift.|$|E
25|$|Other {{highlights}} for 1971 {{included a}} wrap-around instrument panel shared with Ninety-Eight and Toronado models (Toronados had a slightly smoother upper leading edge design) that was highlighted {{by a large}} square speedometer and all controls within easy reach of the driver, and a one-year only Flo-Through ventilation system that utilized vents in the trunklid. The system used on all GM B-, C- and E-body cars and the Chevrolet Vega, used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the <b>trunk</b> <b>lid</b> or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.|$|E
5000|$|This small GT car {{featured}} an OHC [...] {{four-cylinder engine}} designed by Ferrari engineers, for an in-house project originally dubbed [...] "Ferrarina." [...] The original engine design {{was basically a}} four-cylinder, [...] slice of a Colombo V12 from a Ferrari 212, complete with characteristic [...] "clothes pin" [...] valve springs, and breathing through two Weber 40 DCOE9 carburetors. Power was 98 HP, with a HP/Litre ratio, better than the contemporary Ferrari 275 GTB.The 1000 GT featured a double wishbone arrangement for its front suspension, with a live axle at the rear. Both ends of the car featured coils springs, tubular dampers, and an anti-roll bar, as well as disk brakes. The coupe model was bodied in steel, with aluminum for the hood and <b>trunk</b> <b>lids.</b>|$|R

25|$|As sales progressed, Honda created {{two more}} sales channels, called Honda Clio in 1984, and Honda Primo in 1985. The Honda Clio chain sold {{products}} that were traditionally associated with Honda dealerships before 1978, like the Honda Accord, and Honda Primo sold the Honda Civic, kei cars, {{such as the}} Honda Today, superminis like the Honda Capa, along with other Honda products, such as farm equipment, lawn mowers, portable generators, marine equipment, plus motorcycles and scooters like the Honda Super Cub. A styling tradition was established when Honda Primo and Clio began operations, in that all Verno products had the rear license plate installed in the rear bumper, while Primo and Clio products had the rear license plate installed on the <b>trunk</b> <b>lid</b> or rear door for minivans.|$|E
25|$|For the 2011 MY, the XRS and XLE {{grades were}} {{discontinued}} for the US market (XRS is still available in Canada). The revised Corolla features new {{front and rear}} exterior styling and interior design changes, including a redesigned front grille, front and rear bumpers, new wheel designs, rear chrome garnish, rear combination lamps and <b>trunk</b> <b>lid.</b> The interior adds a metallic trim (LE and S grades), new fabrics and a sport tilt/telescopic steering wheel (S grade). Corolla also features two new colors, Nautical Blue Metallic and Sandy Beach Metallic. New standard features for the LE grade include cruise control, Remote Keyless Entry, two additional audio speakers, and variable intermittent windshield wipers with a mist cycle. The S grade adds standard cruise control, Remote Keyless Entry, 16-inch alloy wheels and a color-keyed rear deck spoiler.|$|E
25|$|The 2010 Shelby GT500 was {{revealed}} by Ford through {{a press release}} on January 1, 2009, prior to a public unveiling at the 2009 North American International Auto Show.

Inside the GT500 gains a cobra disc on the steering wheel, shift ball, and seats with embroidered cobras.|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of cost {{has become a major}} goal in the industrial world and over time this has resulted in the replacement of metallic components with plastic components which are not only equally reliable but also light in weight as compared to their metallic counter parts. The impact on the automotive industry is no different, plastic components are already being used in exterior and interior components such as bumpers, headlights and taillights, dashboards, doors, windows, mirror housing, <b>trunk</b> <b>lids,</b> hoods, grilles and wheel covers. This not only reduces the cost of production, but also optimizes weight to make vehicles more energy efficient. With regard to engines, though plastics have been used in making engine components such manifolds, engine covers, cylinder head covers and engine air flow components, not much progress has been made towards developing plastic engines. Proposed herein is a design of a plastic engine which can be an alternative to the conventional internal combustion engine used in the automotive industry. Th...|$|R
5000|$|The {{vehicles}} are stripped of interior fixtures, trim, plastic, lights, and glass. They are repainted, often in loud, garish designs and on low budgets (spray paint is frequently used to mark names, slogans and identification). Additional modifications include trimming sheet metal {{from around the}} wheel wells, removing parts of bumpers, welding the doors shut, and relocating the battery and gas tank. The radiator is sometimes relocated to the back seat. To make the cars last longer, they are occasionally pre-bent, with frames notched, rear bumpers removed, <b>trunk</b> <b>lids</b> notched, and rear coil springs are (when rules allow) replaced with leaf springs. In many instances, roll bars, fire extinguishers, and other safety equipment is installed. [...] Sometimes the removed parts create bulk availability of off-color parts for older cars that are compatible with them. In most cases, any vehicle parts must be [...] "stock", though in some derbies a [...] "gladiator" [...] or [...] "outlaw" [...] division allows cars to be extensively modified and reinforced.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of stop lamp intensity, area, and aspect ratio on reaction time. Recent trends in auto body styling have begun to incorporate center high-mounted stop lamps (CHMSLs) into spoilers and <b>trunk</b> <b>lids.</b> These developments, brought on in part by technical advances in automotive lighting, have resulted in questions about the efficacy of stop lamps whose effective luminous area is long and narrow. Subjects in this study were asked to perform a computer-based tracking task to control their eye fixations, and to provide the approximate cognitive loading associated with driving, while responding to the onset of stop lamps of varying characteristics. The results of this laboratory study indicate that aspect ratio and intensity of stop lamps, as well as their interaction, influence reaction time. Specifically, subject reaction times to the onset of simulated stop lamps were longer when the stimulus intensity was low and the aspect ratio was large. These results suggest that further empirical investigation that examines intensity, area, and aspect ratio of stop lamps in the context of the total rear-signaling system is required to determine whether regulation affecting the aspect ratio of stop lamps or CHMSLs is warranted...|$|R
