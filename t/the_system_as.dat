5|$|A trough {{developed}} {{along the}} northeast monsoon on 25October 2015 off the southwest coast of India, {{consisting of a}} fragmented area of convection, or thunderstorms. The system was located within an environment of moderate wind shear, which prevented early development, although conditions were anticipated to become more favorable. On 26October, the system developed a distinct low pressure area. The low gradually consolidated, and the circulation became better defined, amplified by decreasing wind shear and good outflow {{to the north and}} south. At 03:00UTC on 28October, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> a depression. Nine hours later, the agency upgraded it further to a deep depression, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> Tropical Cyclone 04A at 21:00UTC.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{convection}} persisted on March24 to the east-southeast of the Marshall Islands. Initially {{it consisted}} of a broad but consolidating circulation, with outflow to the north offsetting moderate wind shear to aid in development. It gradually became better organized, with a curved area of convection wrapping into the center. On March26, the JMA classified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> a tropical depression just east of Pohnpei. On March27, the JTWC started tracking <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> a Tropical Depression 04W. Moving west-northwestward, the system's center became more consolidated with convective banding becoming wrapped into it. The JTWC upgraded 04W to a tropical storm the same day, and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Maysak.|$|E
5|$|An area of convection, or thunderstorms, persisted west of Guam on September13, in {{association}} with the monsoon trough. The system gradually developed a low-level circulation and rainbands, aided by low wind shear from an anticyclone aloft. Late on September14, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> a tropical depression to the east of the Philippine island of Luzon. Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> Tropical Depression 12W. A nearby tropical upper tropospheric trough limited the depression's outflow to the north, although convection continued to increase. The depression moved northwestward along the southwestern periphery of a ridge. At 03:00UTC on September15, the Philippine-based PAGASA began warning on the system, giving it the local name Inday. Nine hours later, the JMA named the system Tropical Storm Fanapi.|$|E

5|$|During late November, {{an area of}} {{convection}} persisted about 625kilometers (390mi) east-southeast of Pohnpei. Satellite imagery indicated broad cyclonic {{turning in}} {{the lower levels of}} the atmosphere, and a trough was located near the surface. The disturbance developed rainbands and gradually became better organized. By December2, the system had an elongated low-level circulation, located to the south of the convection. At 0600UTC that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> a tropical depression about 735km (450mi) east-northeast of Pohnpei. Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, and at 1800UTC on December 2 the agency classified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> Tropical Depression 31W. Initially the depression moved to the west-northwest, and early on December3 the JTWC classified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> a tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|In early April 1996, a {{surge in}} the trade winds interacted with the monsoon trough to produce an area of convection. On 2April, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) first {{identified}} <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> a low to mid-level low pressure area over Indonesia north of Darwin, Australia. Despite strong wind shear, the system slowly became better organized as it moved southward, aided by improving upper-level outflow. Early on 5April, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> Tropical Cyclone 25S as the system began a westward track, steered by a building mid-level ridge to the south. Shortly thereafter, the BoM upgraded the system to a Category1 cyclone, designating the storm as Tropical Cyclone Olivia.|$|E
5|$|On May20, {{following}} Typhoon Brenda's {{passage through}} the South China Sea, a monsoon trough extending from the area into the Bay of Bengal received enhanced low-level southwesterly flow. An environment of weak wind shear {{in the wake of}} the typhoon allowed a new area of low pressure to form within the southwesterly flow on May21. With convection becoming persistent and the system's overall presentation more organized by May22, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 0300UTC. Around this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> a tropical depression. Later that day, convection wrapped entirely around the center of circulation; this structural improvement, combined with nearby surface observations, prompted the JTWC to designate <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> Tropical Storm Cecil.|$|E

The system intensified into Tropical Storm Gretelle late on January20, by which time the JTWC gave it the designation Tropical Cyclone 20S. Due to a large ridge centered near Île Amsterdam, the storm tracked generally southwestward toward the Mascarene Islands. Early on January22, the JTWC upgraded the storm to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane, and later that day, the MFR upgraded Gretelle to tropical cyclone status, or with 10minute sustained winds of at least 120km/h (75mph).|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Noul {{were related to}} a strong {{westerly}} wind burst that also {{led to the formation}} of later Typhoon Dolphin. By April30, 2015, an area of convection, or thunderstorms, persisted and pulsed about 230km (145mi) west-southwest of Chuuk State within the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). The system had a broad circulation amid an environment favorable for tropical cyclogenesis, including low to moderate wind shear. The circulation slowly consolidated, developing improved outflow and increasingly organized convection. At 06:00UTC on May2, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> a tropical depression about 850km (525mi) west-southwest of Chuuk. At 00:00UTC the next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> Tropical Depression 06W.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} to Koni developed {{as an area}} of deep convection within an active monsoon trough well south of Guam on July12. Though atmospheric conditions were favorable for tropical cyclogenesis, the tropical disturbance failed to maintain consistent shower activity. Late on July14, however, the system developed organized rainbands. This prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) to classify <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> a tropical depression at 0000UTC on July15, well north of Palau. Shortly after, the storm entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration(PAGASA), immediately classifying <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> a tropical depression and designating it with the name Gilas; the JTWC later classified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> such at 1200UTC that day. A subtropical ridge to the north steered the depression westward for much of its initial stages.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone Herbie {{originated}} {{from an area}} of low pressure on 17May 1988 northwest of the Cocos Islands.

Several hours after, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> Tropical Depression 21S, having attained winds of 45km/h (30mph 1-minute sustained). Following slight development, the system intensified into a Category1 cyclone and was given the name Herbie by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology early on 18May. Several hours after being named, the storm attained its initial peak intensity with winds of 75km/h (45mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 990hPa (mbar).|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Kirogi {{originated}} {{out of a}} disorganized area of {{showers and}} thunderstorms on June30, 2000, associated with a weak area of low pressure, situated roughly 650km (405mi) east of the Philippine island of Mindanao. The system remained nearly stationary for two days as it became increasingly organized. On July1, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as they anticipated the low to develop into a significant tropical cyclone within 24hours. Around 0600UTC the following day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> a tropical depression. At the same time, the JTWC also classified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> Tropical Depression 05W and six hours later, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began issuing advisories on the same system, classifying it as Tropical Depression Ditang.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Prapiroon, {{known in}} the Philippines as Tropical Storm Henry, was a minimal typhoon which caused deadly {{flooding}} in southern China in August 2006.

Two days later, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and PAGASA classified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> a tropical depression, with PAGASA giving it the local name 'Henry'. By July31, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> Tropical Depression 07W.

5|$|A {{long-lived}} system {{developed on}} February28 in the Australian region south of February28, and moved westward. On March7, the JTWC initiated advisories on <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> Tropical Cyclone 26S, briefly estimating peak 1-minute winds of 65km/h (40mph) the next day. Soon after, the system weakened into a tropical depression, crossing into the south-west Indian Ocean late on March8. At that time, it was designated Tropical Disturbance E2. Continuing westward {{along the northern}} edge of a strong ridge, the disturbance failed to intensify due to easterly wind shear. Although the MFR ceased issuing advisories, they noted that a distinct circulation persisted, reaching a location to the north of Mauritius by March16. That day, it turned back to the east with a sporadic area of convection, influenced by the larger Tropical Depression E3. Two days later, the system organized enough for the MFR to reclassify it as a tropical disturbance. The system failed to reorganize much, and dissipated on March20. Another tropical disturbance, named E3, formed on March11 in the eastern portion of the basin. It initially failed to develop more, but after an increase in convection, the system intensified into a tropical depression on March14 while moving generally west-northwestward. On the next day, the system began drifting to the southwest due to weak steering currents. On March16, the JTWC initiated advisories on <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> Tropical Cyclone 28S, briefly upgrading it to tropical storm status on the next day. On March18, the depression began weakening, dissipating three days later.|$|E
5|$|A {{squall line}} which moved {{offshore}} New York and southern New England formed a mesoscale convective vortex, which fired new thunderstorm activity each day {{as it moved}} within the westerlies across the northern Atlantic. Once it reached mid-ocean, an increasingly northerly steering flow dropped the system down into the subtropics {{to the east of}} Bermuda, and it maintained decent organization. By 2100UTC on July 24, the National Hurricane Center began classifying <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> Tropical Depression Two. In the first advisory on the depression, it was noted that the previous tropical depression was erroneously classified as Tropical Depression Two.|$|E
5|$|After a {{subtropical}} depression {{exited the}} Mozambique Channel, {{another area of}} convection formed in the region on January8, which fluctuated in intensity for several days. A passing cold front increased convection further on January12, which split off a cutoff low-pressure area. Two days later, a subtropical disturbance formed offshore Beira, Mozambique, classified due to the extratropical origins and lack of centralized convection. The system remained nearly stationary, with the convection extending well to the east. On January16, the MFR reclassified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> a tropical depression after the thunderstorms increased near the center, the increasing organization due to moderate but decreasing wind shear. By that time, the depression had begun an eastward movement, but soon turned to {{the south in the}} weakness between two high-pressure areas. Late on January16, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alda after the convection organized into a central dense overcast. Also that day, the JTWC began tracking <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> Tropical Cyclone 12S. This marked an unusually late start for the first named storm, at the time the third-latest on record.|$|E
