5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} built with two lanes in each direction, {{but with an}} unusually wide central reservation to accommodate a third lane to be added each way at a later date. The work was a compromise between the Ministry of Transport and Drake, the latter who thought two lanes would not be adequate. Initially, the shoulders were hardened with gravel but not paved, a fact still reflected in the British term hard shoulder. A hedge was planted {{along the length of}} the central reservation to help reduce dazzle from <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> of oncoming traffic at night. The road was constructed to not be a long length of straight road and with the addition of various bridges and tree planting, in the hope to prevent driver boredom reported on foreign motorways.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} view of Rihanna lying in open waters, as other scenes of {{diamonds}} being rolled in a manner suggestive of making a joint are intercutâ€“ a scene reminiscent of the single's artwork. As the video progresses Rihanna is shown running on a highway. In a black-and-white scene, Rihanna licks the joint and begins smoking it. The image fades to black as the song begins. Rihanna performs in the same black-and-white setting while in a black corset. Images of Rihanna on a bed in a room while singing are shown, with objects breaking, curtains falling and roses burning in reverse effect. Rihanna is shown again on the highway, running away from what appears to be <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> of a chasing car. She then stops as she looks up to the night sky at an aurora view. Throughout the video, Rihanna's hand is shown intertwined with that of a heavily tattooed man, whose face is not shown in the video. As the second verse starts, Rihanna is shown in a desert where horses run freely. Scenes of a street battle are later shown, depicting burning cars and broken glass around the environment. As the video continues, the singer and her lover's hands are shown slowly slipping apart, with only their fingertips touching towards the conclusion of the video. The video ends with Rihanna once again floating alone in the open waters.|$|E
25|$|The Grand Cherokee {{received}} a minor facelift for 2008. The bottom part of <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> became rounded and High Intensity Discharge (HID) Headlamps with auto leveling were added.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{important}} design criterion for these curves is headlight sight distance. When a driver is driving on a sag curve at night, the sight distance {{is limited by}} the higher grade in front of the vehicle. [...] This distance must be long enough that the driver can see any obstruction on the road and stop the vehicle within <b>the</b> <b>headlight</b> sight distance. [...] <b>The</b> <b>headlight</b> sight distance (S) is determined by the angle of <b>the</b> <b>headlight</b> and angle of the tangent slope {{at the end of the}} curve. [...] By first finding <b>the</b> <b>headlight</b> sight distance (S) and then solving for the curve length (L) in each of the equations below, the correct curve length can be determined. [...] If the Slength is greater than <b>the</b> <b>headlight</b> sight distance, then this number can be used. [...] If it is smaller, this value cannot be used. [...] Similarly, if the S>L curve length is smaller than <b>the</b> <b>headlight</b> sight distance, then this number can be used. [...] If it is larger, this value cannot be used.|$|R

However, <b>the</b> <b>headlight</b> makes it difficult to classify vehicle types using visual video images taken at night, whereas thermal video cameras have an obvious advantage in the case of nighttime surveillance.|$|R
25|$|The first {{generation}} Sutphens from 2009 are noticeable by having double colored red led lenses above <b>the</b> <b>headlights.</b> Siren speakers {{are in the}} bumper. The sides of the cab have mini Whelen Freedom light bars.|$|E
25|$|Automatic {{systems for}} {{activating}} the headlamps {{have been available}} since the mid-1960s, originally only on luxury American models such as Cadillac, Lincoln and Imperial. Basic implementations turn <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> on at dusk and off at dawn. Modern implementations use sensors to detect the amount of exterior light.|$|E
25|$|Only minor styling changes {{highlighted}} the 1976 Buick LeSabre, {{which was the}} final year for the 1971-vintage bodyshell, the unpopular and rarely-ordered driver- and passenger-side airbag option, the 455 V8 and hardtop bodystyles. Changes amounted to rectangular quad headlights, eggcrate grille and turn signals located just below <b>the</b> <b>headlights.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Construction on the [...] "prow" [...] {{portion of}} the locomotive's streamlining, also made of aluminum, began on November 10, 2016 by Gemini Industrial Machine in Dover, Ohio.

50|$|Throughout {{the twentieth}} century, the town's weekly {{newspaper}} was <b>The</b> Terry <b>Headlight.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Headlight</b> was edited in Terry and printed in Crystal Springs {{in the office}} of the Crystal Springs Meteor. Editors of this publication included Mamie Birdsong, Willie Dean Sojourner Brister, Carolyn Booth Patrick, and Elsie Moss Berryhill. Among the columnists were Fanny Dulaney, Dot Champion, and Rev. Ryburn Stancil. <b>The</b> Terry <b>Headlight</b> ceased its publication approximately in 1990.|$|R
25|$|A major {{facelift}} {{occurred in}} June 2001 (Phase 2) which saw the exterior restyled (most visibly <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> were made more angular), the interior quality improved {{with a new}} dashboard and centre console including the availability of digital climate control air-conditioning and satellite navigation on top models and a 1.5L common rail Diesel engine added.|$|E
25|$|As {{it was the}} {{top-line}} Oldsmobile, {{the series}} had the most technologically advanced items available, such as the Hydramatic automatic transmission, the Autronic Eye, an automatic headlight dimmer, and Twilight Sentinel (a feature that automatically turned <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> on and off via a timer, as controlled by the driver), and the highest-grade interior and exterior trim.|$|E
25|$|The Leaf's frontal {{style is}} {{characterized}} by a sharp V-shape design with large, up slanting light-emitting diode (LED) headlights that create a distinctive blue internal reflective design. <b>The</b> <b>headlights</b> also split and redirect airflow away from the door mirrors, which reduces wind noise and aerodynamic drag. The LED low-beam headlights consume less electricity than halogen lamps.|$|E

25|$|Headlight {{flashing}} is the act {{of either}} briefly switching on <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> of a car, or of momentarily switching between a headlight's high beams and low beams, {{in an effort to}} communicate with another driver or drivers. The signal is sometimes referred to in car manufacturers' manuals as an optical horn, since it draws the attention of other drivers.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, {{there was}} an {{accident}} on the Thunderbolt when operators failed to brake an incoming train, which collided with the train being loaded. Thirty people were injured in the crash. After the accident, <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> on the cars were partially removed because the electrical system did not hold up well against the vibration of the cars.|$|E
25|$|On the exterior, {{was a new}} 11-spoke wheel design, new fog lights, {{and smoked}} {{surrounding}} trim for <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> and taillights. On the interior, a new 2-position memory function was added for the driver seat, a maintenance indicator light, automatic drive-away door locking system, a new storage compartment on the dash (for models without the navigation system) and new trim highlights.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Custom" [...] variant, {{introduced}} in 1979, had a smaller, narrower tank and buckhorn handlebars. <b>The</b> <b>headlight</b> and gauges {{were similar to}} the CX500 Deluxe. Turn signals were now mounted along the fork tubes, {{below the level of}} <b>the</b> <b>headlight.</b> 1982 was <b>the</b> last model year for the CX500. In 1983 it was bumped up to 673 cc and became the CX650. The CX650's styling was different, and the engine was painted black instead of silver.|$|R
50|$|In 2009 the Suzuki Raider 150R got {{a slight}} makeover in its design. <b>The</b> <b>headlight</b> was changed {{inspired}} {{by that of}} the GSX-R superbikes.|$|R
25|$|The {{seats and}} door panels were also redesigned. The new door panels {{contained}} integrated armrests, with the controls {{for the power}} windows and locks mounted flat on its frontal part, allowing the driver to operate them without moving their arm. These switches, along {{with all of the}} main controls, would become illuminated when <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> were turned on, allowing the driver to easily see them at night.|$|E
25|$|Present systems {{based on}} imaging CMOS cameras can detect and respond {{appropriately}} to leading and oncoming vehicles while disregarding streetlights, road signs, and other spurious signals. Camera-based beam selection was first released in 2005 on the Jeep Grand Cherokee, {{and has since}} then been incorporated into comprehensive driver assistance systems by automakers worldwide. <b>The</b> <b>headlights</b> will dim when a bright reflection bounces off of a street sign.|$|E
25|$|The Dacia {{designers}} {{wanted to}} give a new look for the Dacia models and the front side comes with several new features. The front and back bumpers have been slightly redesigned and <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> have a new design that includes LED day running lights (it {{is the first time}} that Dacia models offer LED lights).The aesthetic package is completed by a new front grille, similar to the one found on the Duster.|$|E
50|$|The upper fairing of the VF1000R {{featured}} a sealed air intake behind <b>the</b> <b>headlight,</b> which directed air towards the upper mounted engine coolant radiator. Because of this, most VF1000R's used in competition had the front number plates {{mounted on the}} front of the windscreen instead of in the traditional location, where <b>the</b> <b>headlight</b> would be on the road going version. This area was filled with a mesh screen in order to feed the radiator with the maximum amount of air possible.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} some experimental investigations {{to study}} the air flow patterns on <b>the</b> <b>headlight</b> domes of different two wheelers (HERO HONDA PASSION PLUS and BAJAJ PULSAR) which influence {{the stability of the}} vehicle. The pressure distribution over the surface of the profile and the drag force are to be determined for various headlight dome orientations. This study helps in suggesting <b>the</b> suitable <b>headlight</b> dome profile that may reduce the drag force and effect of turbulence which in turn leads to the increase of vehicle stability. The results obtained during the simulation are to be validated by conducting the experiments on the scale down model of <b>the</b> <b>headlight</b> dome of HERO HONDA PASSION PLUS using Wind Tunnel test rig. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tool was used to simulate the air flow pattern on <b>the</b> <b>headlight</b> dome in which boundary layer separation doesnâ€™t exist. The results obtained from the simulation are to be compared with the experimental results from the wind tunnel and the variation is to be found and that should be in the acceptable limit...|$|R

25|$|The SM's six {{headlight}} set up {{was illegal}} in the U.S. {{at the time}} and consequently, U.S. specification cars were fitted with four fixed round exposed lamps. Also, the separate glass windshields of <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> were illegal in the USA after 1967, which is why the DS did not get them on USA cars when it was restyled for 1968, and the VW Beetle and Vanagon/Kombi and Jaguar E-Type lost their headlight glass windshields at the same time.|$|E
25|$|The styling of the GTV, while distinctive, {{can be seen}} {{to share}} many design {{features}} derived from the Montreal supercar, as translated down to a simpler and thus more marketable vehicle. Examples of this are the bonnet line, which while briefer, still has 'scallops' for <b>the</b> <b>headlights,</b> and the tail light clusters which resemble those of the Montreal. The door shape is similar, and in a sharing of parts, both vehicles employ the same door handles.|$|E
25|$|The Taurus is {{credited}} with bringing many new design features into the mainstream marketplace. The Taurus used flush aerodynamic composite headlights, {{and was one of}} the first American sedans to do so. Originally, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) required that all cars sold in the United States use standardized round or rectangular sealed beam headlights, and Ford had to convince them to change the rule to allow <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> be any shape, as long as they met federal lighting standards.|$|E
