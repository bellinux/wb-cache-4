50|$|In October 1968, {{planning}} permission was granted {{for the construction}} of a new town hall in Hove. The new town hall was built by John Wells-Thorpe in the Brutalist architecture style, predominantly out of concrete clad. Construction began in 1970, and the town hall was officially opened in 1974 by Lord Rupert Nevill. The building contained a faceted wooden ceiling in the great hall and a concrete entrance with four hexagonal columns. In 1991, the building was extended, adding a Registrar's Office, Citizens Advice Bureau and Tourist information centre, and in 1994, a yellow Royal Mail postbox donated by Draveil, a <b>town</b> <b>twinned</b> <b>with</b> Hove, was placed in front of the town hall. In 2014, a proposal was submitted for replacing the glass with green double-glazed glass and extending the entrance; separately, a request to English Heritage for the building to become a listed building, as one of the only pieces of post-war architecture in Brighton and Hove was denied. In 2015, the town hall suffered a fire believed to have been caused by an electrical fault in the roof's solar panels; the black smoke from the fire was visible throughout Brighton and Hove.|$|E
