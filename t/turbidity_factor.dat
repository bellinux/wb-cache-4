40|$|The {{atmospheric}} turbidity expresses the attenuation {{of the solar}} radiation that reaches the Earth’s surface under cloudless sky and describes the optical thickness of the atmosphere. We investigate the {{atmospheric turbidity}} over Ghardaı̈a city using two turbidity parameters, the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> and the Angström turbidity coefficient. Their values and temporal variation are obtained from data recorded between 2004 and 2008 at Ghardaı̈a. The results show that both parameters have the same trend along the year.

The monthly average value varies between 1. 3 and 5. 6 for the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> and between 0. 02 and 0. 19 for the Angström turbidity coefficient. We find that 39. 8 % of the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> values are less than 3, 47. 5 % are between 3 and 5 and only 12. 7 % are greater than 5.

40|$|Study of Atmospheric {{turbidity}} {{is important}} for purposes of meteorology, ecology, climatology and monitoring of atmospheric pollution.

The model {{is based on the}} calculation of the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factors</b> for the stations Bet-Dagan, Jerusalem, Beer Sheva, Sedom and Eilat, which have been determined from radiation measurements. The <b>turbidity</b> <b>factors</b> for clear sky conditions showed a characteristic yearly pattern and the differences between the stations were related to their geographical locations. The model requires different algorithms for calculations in the Rift Valley system and the rest of Israel. The calculations proved to be very accurate for clear sky conditions with high radiation values (average deviation: 7. 3 % or 61. 6 W/m 2 for values above 600 W/m 2). The presence of clouds and lower sun angles lead to less accurate results, which are nevertheless still acceptable within the range for further applications.

40|$|The thesis {{contains}} mainly two parts: 1) {{the solar}} energy resource assessment through measurements and comparison of solar irradiance models {{and analysis of}} atmospheric turbidity factors; 2) Sensitivity analysis of solar cooling system, monitoring on solar cooling system and pre-design of a solar cooling system test rig in Politecnico di Torino. Firstly, the solar energy resource assessment {{is based on the}} measurements of solar beam normal irradiance and solar global horizontal irradiance in Turin during the whole 2010 with available data from end of January until end of December except two thirds of August when the Politecnico di Torino was closed since the campaign was carried on inside the department of Energy. Measured data have been compared with clear-sky models and the atmospheric <b>turbidity</b> <b>factors</b> have been calculated and compared with that in 1975 - 6 to evaluate the air-quality variation during the last three decades. Secondly, a series of sensitivity analysis on solar cooling system with various configurations has been undertaken through simulation software Polysun. Field data of solar cooling system in IPLA (Istituto per le Piante da Legno e l'Ambiente) have been monitored and analyzed. The main conclusions are: The ASHRAE clear-sky model mostly fits the solar beam normal irradiance while it has been found that the solar diffuse radiation factor ‘C' (C=Gdh/Gbn) actually not constant but varies all through the day in a typical way; The <b>turbidity</b> <b>factors</b> are lower in 2010 during winter time due to usage of cleaner fuels and district heating while during summer they increase due to heavier traffic; Solar factor (SF) increases as solar collector area is larger, but its increasing ratio is decreasing and SF decreases as volume size of storage tank is bigger after the demand side is satisfied; the three-week monitoring campaign has shown a satisfactory performance of this solar cooling system in PUEEL, although the solar installation appears oversize...|$|R

It is modified for its use with GOES satellite images in order to estimate the solar irradiation over French Guiana. Modifications include a change in the calibration formula, in the calculation of the cloud albedo, and in the values of the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor.</b> These modifications allow the improvement of the performances of the Heliosat-II model in Intertropical zones in French Guiana. The outcomes were compared to coincident measurements of hourly irradiation performed by ground stations. The results show that the use of the maximum apparent albedo as the cloud albedo (ρcmax), along with a fixed value of the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> produces the best results; the bias was less than 23. 61 Wh/m 2 (5 % of the mean value of the measurements) overall, and the RMSE was less than 109. 39 W/m 2 (24 %) overall when using hourly values. In the case of daily means, the RMSE drops to less than 10. 08 W/m 2 (10 %) overall, whereas the overall bias remains unchanged, as expected. The model performs better in clear skies than in cloudy skies. The results suggest that the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> used in the Heliosat-II method does not reproduce well the attenuation of the solar radiation in French Guiana. The results were compared to those obtained from Heliosat II method and Meteosat images (HelioClim- 3 database) and we found a better accuracy for GOES satellite data, which exhibits smaller viewing angle.

This ESRA model is described and analysed with the main objective of being used to estimate solar radiation at ground level from satellite images with the Heliosat method.

The diffuse clear-sky irradiation estimated by this ESRA model and by other models has been also checked against ground measurements, for different ranges of the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> and solar elevation.

The r. m. s. error in the estimation of the hourly diffuse irradiation ranges from 11 Wh. m- 2 to 35 Wh. m- 2 for diffuse irradiation up to 250 Wh. m- 2.

Geological Survey {{has several}} ongoing {{projects}} throughout the Nation that use con-tinuous monitoring of instream turbidity to develop es-timates of water quality. The recent development of several in situ sensors {{has made it}} possible to continu-ously monitor turbidity in “real time. ” The statistical relations between turbidity and certain sediment or sediment-bound, water-quality constituents have made it possible to provide a “real-time” estimate of concen-trations of certain water-quality constituents such as total suspended solids, suspended sediment concentra-tion, various nutrients, and bacteria. Continuously monitored instream turbidity may provide more accurate concentration predictions than traditional surrogates such as discharge; however, there are many issues and limitations regarding turbidity. These include: (1) different methods and technologies used to measure turbidity, (2) effects that physical properties of the solids and streamwater have on the measurement of turbidity, and (3) the best deployment strategy for measuring instream turbidity. This paper summarizes the potential and limitations of turbidity as a water-quality surrogate including selected methods and technologies for measuring <b>turbidity,</b> <b>factors</b> that affect <b>turbidity</b> readings, and some of the issues encountered when monitoring instream turbidity.

40|$|The {{sampling}} of rivers and large streams for schistosome cercariae requires {{a method that}} is both highly accurate and capable of analysing several hundred litres of water regardless of turbidity. Four techniques—direct filtration by Rowan's vacuum paper filtration method, a modification of Rowan's method, continous centrifugation, and an overlay filtration method—were compared for recovery accuracy, volume of water sampled, and ease of reading under simulated field conditions. The modified Rowan technique ranked first for mean recovery accuracy (79. 4 %), followed by continuous centrifugation (53. 8 %), Rowan's technique (25. 9 %), and the overlay method (22. 4 %). With the direct filtration techniques, the filtering rate was directly related to certain <b>turbidity</b> <b>factors,</b> the maximum being 10 litres/min with the modified Rowan technique and clear water. The continuous centrifugation and overlay methods were independent of turbidity variations. Filters could be read most quickly (mean time 3. 4 min/filter) with the continuous centrifugation technique because the concentrated sample {{made it possible to}} use small (47 -mm) filters. Mean reading times with the other techniques (89 -mm and 90 -mm filters) ranged from 5. 6 to 8. 4 min per filter but were highly variable in relation to turbidity, particle size, and number of cercariae recovered. Direct filtration by the modified Rowan technique is considered to be the simplest and most efficient method. When flocculation is included, the resulting additional loss of cercariae (16 %) is within acceptable limits...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Heliosat- 2 method, {{which employs}} {{satellite}} images to assess solar irradiance at ground level, {{is one of}} the most accurate among the available operational methods. Its input variables have uncertainties which impact on the final result. The General Law of Uncertainty Propagation is employed to analyze the impact of these uncertainties on a single pixel with Meteosat- 7 inputs in various stages, beginning with the sensitivity coefficients and the changes induced in the clear-sky index (KC) by each independent variable. Once these coefficients are known, the partial combined standard uncertainty (CSU) is calculated for KC from each independent variable and albedo. Finally, the total CSU of KC is calculated. All of the results are in agreement and show that the most influential variables in the uncertainty of estimation of cloudy skies are, in this order, the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> (54 % of KC value), terrain elevation (33 %), the calibration coefficient of the satellite sensor (13 %) and the ground albedo (5 %). What causes the initial uncertainty in the ground albedo is its variation over time and the difficulty in assessing it from a reflectance time-series for mixed clear and cloudy skies. The Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> is the most influential variable on the width of the uncertainty interval, not only because of its own uncertainty (17 % in this study), but because it is also used in numerous intermediate calculations.

The sampling was done by filtering 50 liters of water by using a planktonet. After that, the environment factors were measured including physical <b>factors</b> (temperatures and <b>turbidity)</b> and chemical <b>factors</b> (BOD, DO, free CO 2, pH, nitrate, and phosphate). To determine the relationship between physical factors and chemical factors on the diversity of phytoplankton, analyses using the Double Correlation Analysis by SPSS 11. 5 were done and continued by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine the environmental factors influencing the diversity of phytoplankton. The research results showed that there were 33 types of phytoplankton consisting of four classes (Chlorophyceae, Cyanophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, and Euglenophyceae). The highest phytoplankton density in Bayem River located in point 4 (the first repetition) amounted to 804300 ind/I dominated by Pondorina morum. The diversity of phytoplankton in Bayem River was low while the absence frequency with the absolute absence value included Pandorina morum, Ulothrix zonata, and Oscillatoria sp. The absence frequency with the medium absence value included Microspora sp, Pediastrum gracillium, Scenedesmus quadricauda, Scenedesmus obliquus, Achanthes lanceolata, Heteronema acus, Phacus pleuronectus, Euglena viridis, Lepocinclis sp, Closterium setaceum, Spirostomum sp, and Surirela tenera.

This method calls upon the clear-sky model proposed in the European Solar Radiation Atlas (ESRA) The only input to this model that describes the atmospheric optical properties is the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor.</b> This factor summarizes in one quantity the effects of the aerosols and water vapour. Values of the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> are available on a climatotological basis.

We have investigated the possibility of exploiting advanced data sets on aerosol properties together with a recent model for clear-sky to correct existing databases containing solar surface irradiation computed by the ESRA+Linke model. These aerosol data sets originate from the MACC project as well as the McClear clear-sky model. A series of ground measurements was asembled in order to serve as a reference in the comparison of the original and corrected satellite-derived irradiations.

40|$|International audienceIn {{a context}} of {{sustainable}} development, interest for concentrating solar power and concentrating photovoltaic technologies is growing rapidly. One {{of the most challenging}} topics is to improve solar resource assessment and forecasting in order to optimize power plant operation. Since clear sky defines the nominal operating conditions of the plants, improving their management requires the use in real-time of clear-sky direct normal irradiance (DNI) models. Typically, accuracy is best achieved by considering water vapor and aerosol concentrations in the atmosphere separately. However, measuring such physical quantities is not easy and requires a weather station close to the considered site. When these data are not available, the attenuating effects can be modelled by atmospheric <b>turbidity</b> <b>factors</b> which can be obtained from DNI under clear-sky conditions. So, the main purpose of the present paper is to propose an efficient approach to assess the clear-sky DNI in real time. This approach combines an existing empirical model, proposed by Ineichen and Perez, with a new methodology for the computation of atmospheric turbidity. It takes advantage of the fact that changes in atmospheric turbidity are relatively small throughout the day in comparison to changes in DNI, even when the sky is free of clouds. In the present study, we considered data from two experimental sites (Golden, in the USA, and Perpignan, in France) and used a wavelet-based multi-resolution analysis as a clear-sky DNI detection tool. In addition, we compared the proposed approach with several combinations of empirical models and ways of computing atmospheric turbidity. The first model is a polynomial of the cosine of the solar zenith angle, whereas the two other models use atmospheric turbidity as an additional input. Regarding its calculation, monthly and daily mean values have been considered. Moreover, we defined a procedure in order to evaluate the accuracy of all the considered approaches. This procedure allows changes in DNI caused by clouds to be simulated using a noisy signal applied to clear-sky periods. In both sites, our approach to the real-time assessment of the clear-sky DNI outperforms the other approaches. In the worst case, the mean absolute error is reduced by 8 W m − 2 in comparison to the approaches based on monthly mean values of atmospheric turbidity, and reduced by about 30 W m − 2 when taking the polynomial-based model as a reference...|$|R
40|$|We review {{recent work}} {{on the effect of}} hypoxia and <b>turbidity</b> (two <b>factors</b> that often co-occur in coastal areas) on escape performance, {{including}} swimming and timing variables. We hypothesize that hypoxia and turbidity may affect escape responses {{as a result of a}} decrease in sensory performance (e. g. in responsiveness and timing) and in stimulus strength, respectively. Fish were startled using mechanical and visual stimuli. The effect of hypoxia was studied in three species of fish from Mediterranean lagoons (Mugil cephalus, Liza aurata and Dicentrarcus labrax). Hypoxia affected the responsiveness of all three species. When performing aquatic surface respiration (ASR) in hypoxia, M. cephalus showed improved responsiveness. However, previous work has shown that ASR may be inhibited by the presence of aerial predators. Locomotor performance was affected only in severe hypoxia when the surface was obstructed in L. aurata. The effect of turbidity on visually-mediated escape responses was investigated in juvenile cod (Gadus morhua) by using a predator model. Putative escape success (PES) was used to assess escape performance, and took into account escape timing, direction and swimming performance. Cod had low PES in high turbidity because of decreased responsiveness and poorly timed escapes. The effect of turbidity on PES also depended on predator attack velocity. Overall, the results show that both hypoxia and turbidity may alter the escape ability of fish, by affecting a combination of swimming and timing variables...|$|R

40|$|Age-based {{analyses}} {{were used to}} demonstrate consistent differences in growth between populations of Acanthochromis polyacanthus (Pomacentridae) collected at three distance strata across the continental shelf (inner, mid-, and outer shelf) of the central Great Barrier Reef (three reefs per distance stratum). Fish had significantly greater maximum lengths with increasing distance from shore, but fish from all distances reached approximately the same maximum age, indicating that growth is more rapid for fish found on outer-shelf reefs. Only one fish collected from inner-shelf reefs reached > 100 mm SL, whereas 38 - 67 % of fish collected from the outer shelf were > 100 mm SL. The largest age class of adult-size fish collected from inner-and mid-shelf locations comprised 3 - 4 year-olds, but shifted to 2 -year-olds on outer-shelf reefs. Mortality schedules (Z and S) were similar irrespective of shelf position (inner shelf: 0. 51 and 60. 0 %; mid-shelf: 0. 48 and 61. 8 %; outer shelf: 0. 43 and 65. 1 %, respectively). Age validation of captive fish indicated that growth increments are deposited annually, {{between the end of}} winter and early spring. The observed cross-shelf patterns in adult sizes and growth were unlikely to be a result of genetic differences between sample populations because all fish collected showed the same color pattern. It is likely that cross-shelf variation in quality and quantity of food, as well as in <b>turbidity,</b> are <b>factors</b> that contribute to the observed patterns of growth. Similar patterns of cross-shelf mortality indicate that predation rates varied little across the shelf. Our study cautions against pooling demographic parameters on broad spatial scales without consideration of the potential for cross-shelf variability...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe HelioClim project aims at mapping solar {{radiation}} {{over a wide}} area that covers Europe, Africa, and Atlantic Ocean. To achieve this purpose, Meteosat images will be processed with the Heliosat method, which turns images into maps of {{solar radiation}} at ground level. One of the inputs of this method is the solar radiation under clear sky. The quality of the estimations strongly depends on {{the accuracy of the}} radiative transfer model under clear sky. Therefore several clear-sky models are assessed in this paper. It is found that taking into account the turbidity of the atmosphere, the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor,</b> TL(AM 2), provides better results. The models using TL(AM 2) are then compared. Among them, the "ESRA model", set up {{in the course of the}} realisation of the 4 th edition of the European Solar Radiation Atlas, fits better than the others. Accordingly, this, model is chosen to be used in the Heliosat method...|$|E
40|$|As part of {{a larger}} experiment, {{atmospheric}} turbidity measurements were carried out during the austral summer 1985 / 86 in Adelie Land, Eastern Antarctica at 1560 m elevation. A comparison of our measurements of the solar beam with those of other areas in the Arctic and Antarctic was carried out. Our values were higher than all measurements from the Arctic. For Antarctica, Plateau and Mizuho Stations, both higher in altitude, had somewhat higher values, while the value of the coastal stations were lower. We calculated also turbidity indexes such as Unke's <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> T and Angstrom's turbidity coefficient ß. Mean values of T were around 2. 0, which are low values indeed. Beta values were around 0. 04, a rather typical value for polar regions. No trend in turbidity could be observed for the time of observation. Further, it could be shown that the decrease in intensity with increasing optical air mass was less pronounced for larger wavelengths than for shorter ones...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{results of}} the {{application}} and evaluation of the r. sun model for calculation of the total solar radiation for the Wedel Jarlsberg Land (SW Spitsbergen) are presented. Linke <b>Turbidity</b> <b>Factor</b> (LTF), which is the obligatory parameter for direct and diffused radiation calculations with the r. sun model, is derived here with the empirical formula and meteoro− logical measurements. Few different approaches for calculation of LTF are presented and tested. The r. sun model results, calculated with these various LTF, are evaluated through comparison with total solar radiation measurements gathered at Polish Polar Station. The r. sun model {{is found to be}} in good agreement with the measurements for clear sky condi− tions, with the explained variance (R 2) close to 0. 9. Overall, the model slightly underesti− mates the measured total radiation. Reasonable results were calculated for the cloudiness condition up to 2 octas, and for these r. sun model can be considered as a reliable and flexible tool providing spatial data on solar radiation for the study area...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} {{capabilities of}} two remote-sensing systems in measuring depth and, consequently, bottom contours in sandy-bottomed and sediment-laden coastal waters were determined quantitatively. The Multispectral Scanner (MSS), orbited on the Landsat- 2 satellite, and the Ocean Color Scanner (OCS), flown on U- 2 aircraft, {{were used for}} this evaluation. Analysis of imagery taken simultaneously indicates a potential for hydrographic charting of marine coastal and shallow shelf areas, even when water <b>turbidity</b> is a <b>factor.</b> Several of the eight optical channels examined on the OCS {{were found to be}} sensitive to depth or depth-related information. The greatest sensitivity was in OCS- 4 (0. 544 plus or minus 0. 012 micron) from which contours corresponding to depths up to 12 m were determined. The sharpness of these contours and their spatial stability through time suggests that upwelling radiance is a measure of bottom reflectance and not of water turbidity. The two visible channels on Landsat's MSS were less sensitive in the discrimination of contours, with depths up to 8 m in the high-gain mode (3 X) determined in MSS- 4 (0. 5 to 0. 6 micron) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A multivariate {{approach}} {{was used to}} test the value of intertidal communities as a bioindi-cator of environmental conditions at Algeciras Bay, southern Spain. The study area is located in the Strait of Gibraltar and it is subjected to a variety of anthropic impacts. Eight localities (5 inside and 3 outside the bay) were selected, and four transects were undertaken in each locality to characterise the fauna and flora. The spatial distribution of the intertidal species reflected the physico-chemical conditions of Algeciras Bay. The stations located outside the bay, characterised by high hydrody-namism and dissolved oxygen and low sedimentation and turbidity, had a higher diversity and species richness than the inner stations. According to the BIO-ENV procedure and CCA, water <b>turbidity</b> was the <b>factor</b> which best correlated with the intertidal assemblages. SIMPER showed that the molluscs Chtamalus stellatus, Mytilus cf edulis, Littorina neritoides and Balanus perforatus, and the algae Gelidium pusillum, Corallina elongata, Asparagopsis armata, Colpomenia sinuosa and Fucus spi-ralis were the species that most contributed to the dissimilarity between internal and external sites. The present study, based on the spatial distribution of intertidal taxa, yielded similar results to those previously obtained in the area with costly physico-chemical analysis based on complex matrices of subtidal epifaunal communities. Consequently, the intertidal sampling method proposed in thi...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} how abiotic factors drive the phytoplankton community in a water supply reservoir within short sampling intervals. Samples were collected at the subsurface (0. 1 m) and bottom of limnetic (8 m) and littoral (2 m) zones in both the dry and rainy seasons. The following abiotic variables were analyzed: water temperature, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, turbidity, pH, total nitrogen, nitrite, nitrate, total phosphorus, total dissolved phosphorus and orthophosphate. Phytoplankton biomass was determined from biovolume values. The role abiotic variables play in the dynamics of phytoplankton species was determined by means of Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Algae biomass ranged from 1. 17 &# 215; 10 (4) to 9. 21 &# 215; 10 (4) µg. L- 1; cyanobacteria had biomass values ranging from 1. 07 &# 215; 10 (4) to 8. 21 &# 215; 10 (4) µg. L- 1. High availability of phosphorous, nitrogen limitation, alkaline pH and thermal stability all favored cyanobacteria blooms, particularly during the dry season. Temperature, pH, total phosphorous and <b>turbidity</b> were key <b>factors</b> in characterizing the phytoplankton community between sampling times and stations. Of the species studied, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii populations were dominant in the phytoplankton in both the dry and rainy seasons. We conclude that the phytoplankton was strongly influenced by abiotic variables, particularly in relation to seasonal distribution patterns...|$|R
