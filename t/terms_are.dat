5000|$|Note {{that the}} first <b>term</b> <b>is</b> a {{constant}} [...] and the second <b>term</b> <b>is</b> quadratic in X (i.e. for the Hessian matrix V the second <b>term</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to tr) and therefore relatively easily solved. The third <b>term</b> <b>is</b> bounded by: ...|$|R
25|$|Here, {{the first}} <b>term</b> <b>is</b> the Coriolis force, the second <b>term</b> <b>is</b> the {{centrifugal}} force, {{and the third}} <b>term</b> <b>is</b> the Euler force.|$|R
50|$|His first <b>term</b> <b>was</b> with Rossano Zafferani (October 1987-April 1988). His second <b>term</b> <b>was</b> with Enzo Colombini from (October 2000-April 2001). His third <b>term</b> <b>was</b> with Loris Francini from April 2006 to October 2006. His fourth <b>term</b> <b>was</b> with Guerrino Zanotti (October 2014-April 2015).|$|R
5|$|Much {{remains unknown}} about the {{factorization}} {{of the numbers}} in the Sylvester's sequence. For instance, {{it is not known}} if all numbers in the sequence are squarefree, although all the known <b>terms</b> <b>are.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Woodcock–Johnson III NU Tests of Cognitive Abilities (WJ III NU) was {{developed}} by Richard W. Woodcock, Kevin S. McGrew and Nancy Mather and published in 2007 by Riverside. Note that the WJ III classification <b>terms</b> <b>are</b> not applied to the same score ranges as for the Wechsler or Stanford–Binet tests.|$|E
5|$|The partial sums (the Taylor polynomials) of {{the series}} {{can be used as}} approximations of the entire function. These approximations are good if {{sufficiently}} many <b>terms</b> <b>are</b> included.|$|E
25|$|Here, {{the major}} <b>term</b> <b>is</b> die, the minor <b>term</b> <b>is</b> men, {{and the middle}} <b>term</b> <b>is</b> mortals. Again, both {{premises}} are universal, hence so is the conclusion.|$|R
5000|$|Consecutive <b>terms</b> <b>were</b> {{not allowed}} for 10 years. In 1789 <b>terms</b> <b>were</b> one year. Not exactly though. Before 1789 <b>term</b> lengths <b>were</b> picked by the governor, mostly they were two, three months long. <b>Terms</b> after 1789 <b>were</b> one year long but weren't {{classified}} as [...] "terms". The first actual <b>term</b> <b>was</b> in 1857 when Joseph E. Brown served [...] terms from November 6, 1857, to June 17, 1865. That was the first consecutive term, but consecutive <b>terms</b> <b>were</b> allowed since 1789, it's just {{no one wanted to}} do it! From 1941 to 1977 consecutive were not allowed, after 1977 consecutive <b>terms</b> <b>were</b> re-allowed.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>term</b> <b>is</b> the {{homogeneous}} {{solution and}} the second <b>term</b> <b>is</b> the particular solution.|$|R
5|$|The {{region of}} Macedonia is {{commonly}} split geographically into three main sub-regions, especially when discussing the Macedonian Question. The <b>terms</b> <b>are</b> used in non-partisan scholarly works, {{although they are}} also used in ethnic Macedonian literature of an irredentist nature.|$|E
5|$|There comes a {{time when}} the changes are so great that it is no longer enough to create further {{exceptions}} restricting the effect of the proposition, a time when the proposition itself requires examination to see whether its <b>terms</b> <b>are</b> in accord with what is generally regarded today as acceptable behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally these <b>terms</b> <b>are</b> {{specific}} to certain geographical areas although {{some may be}} used by a particular social group such as pax in the UK, used primarily by children attending private schools. To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured {{by most of the}} children playing together.|$|E
50|$|While {{the origins}} of the <b>term</b> <b>are</b> unclear, the <b>term</b> <b>is</b> often used by {{marketing}} professionals.|$|R
50|$|The N1/2/4 <b>term</b> <b>is</b> {{the column}} factor, the (α-1)/α <b>term</b> <b>is</b> the {{thermodynamic}} factor, and the k2'/(1+k2') <b>term</b> <b>is</b> the retention factor. The 3 factors {{are not completely}} independent, {{but they are very}} close, and can be treated as such.|$|R
5000|$|The first <b>term</b> <b>is</b> {{the moment}} of inertia IR, the second <b>term</b> <b>is</b> zero by {{definition}} {{of the center of}} mass, and the last <b>term</b> <b>is</b> the total mass of the body times the square magnitude of the vector d. Thus, ...|$|R
5|$|Truce <b>terms</b> <b>are</b> {{recorded}} {{as having been}} used in the following circumstances; being out of breath, having a stitch, a shoelace being undone, fear of clothes being damaged, needing to go to the lavatory, checking the time, wanting to discuss or clarify rules during a fight or game, or one combatant wanting to remove their spectacles or jacket before continuing. It does not mean to surrender, although it may sometimes be used in preparation to surrendering. Truce <b>terms</b> <b>are</b> only used within a specific age group, have little currency outside that group and are by and large abandoned by the age of 10 or 11 years. However, research into early recorded use of these terms found examples of some of these terms being used as a sign of surrender in battle or adult fights or quarrels as late as the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|According to {{researchers}} from the National Australian Dictionary Centre {{there is evidence that}} barley (Scotland and the west of England), barlies (Aberdeen and a few English towns), bar (Swansea) and bars (Devon), are used in Australia. In Australia the <b>terms</b> <b>are</b> used regionally with Victorians using barley, New South Welshmen using bar or bars and the people of Western Australia using barlies.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1796, the Rumford Prize, {{awarded by}} the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, {{is one of}} the oldest {{scientific}} prizes in the United States. The prize recognizes contributions by scientists to the fields of heat and light. These <b>terms</b> <b>are</b> widely interpreted; awards range from discoveries in thermodynamics to improvements in the construction of steam boilers.|$|E
50|$|From 1941-1966, the Mayoral <b>term</b> <b>was</b> two years. The <b>term</b> <b>was</b> {{extended}} {{to four years}} in 1967.|$|R

5|$|LARP {{has also}} been {{referred}} to as live role-playing (LRP), interactive literature, and free form role-playing. Some of these <b>terms</b> <b>are</b> still in common use; however, LARP has become the most commonly accepted term. It is sometimes written in lowercase, as larp. The live action in LARP is analogous to the term live action used in film and video to differentiate works with human actors from animation. Playing a LARP is often called larping, and one who does it is a larper.|$|E
5|$|Lung {{function}} {{testing is}} carried out by evaluating a person's capacity to inhale and exhale in different circumstances. The volume of air inhaled and exhaled by a person at rest is the tidal volume (normally 500-750mL); the inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume are the additional amounts a person is able to forcibly inhale and exhale respectively. The summed total of forced inspiration and expiration is a person's vital capacity. Not all air is expelled from the lungs even after a forced breath out; {{the remainder of the}} air is called the residual volume. Together these <b>terms</b> <b>are</b> referred to as lung volumes.|$|E
5|$|Motion, {{the process}} of movement, is {{described}} using specific anatomical terms. Motion includes movement of organs, joints, limbs, and specific sections of the body. The terminology used describes this motion according to its direction relative to the anatomical position of the joints. Anatomists use a unified set of terms to describe most of the movements, although other, more specialized <b>terms</b> <b>are</b> necessary for describing {{the uniqueness of the}} movements such as those of the hands, feet, and eyes.|$|E
5000|$|... {{where the}} first <b>term</b> <b>is</b> {{independent}} of θ and the second <b>term</b> <b>is</b> a perturbation for small θ.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>term</b> <b>is</b> {{known as}} the zero-input {{response}} and the second <b>term</b> <b>is</b> {{known as the}} zero-state response.|$|R
30|$|The {{first order}} <b>term</b> <b>is</b> hence the Heckman correction, {{and will be}} {{sufficient}} if the error <b>term</b> <b>is</b> normally distributed.|$|R
5|$|Self-harm (SH), {{also known}} as self-injury, {{is defined as the}} intentional, direct {{injuring}} of body tissue, done without suicidal intentions. These <b>terms</b> <b>are</b> used in the more recent literature in an attempt to reach a more neutral terminology. The older literature, especially that which predates the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), almost exclusively refers to self-mutilation.|$|E
5|$|Specialised <b>terms</b> <b>are</b> used in taxonomic research. Primary {{homology}} is {{the initial}} hypothesis {{made by a}} researcher based on similar structure or anatomical connections, inferring that two characters share an ancestry. Secondary homology is implied by parsimony analysis, where a character that only occurs once on a tree is taken to be homologous. As implied in this definition, many cladists consider homology to be synonymous with synapomorphy, a shared derived character or trait state that distinguishes a clade from other organisms.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{terms for}} classifying individuals of low intelligence were medical or legal terms {{that preceded the}} development of IQ testing. The legal system recognized a concept of some individuals being so cognitively impaired {{that they were not}} responsible for criminal behavior. Medical doctors sometimes encountered adult patients who could not live independently, being unable {{to take care of their}} own daily living needs. Various terms were used to attempt to classify individuals with varying degrees of intellectual disability. Many of the earliest <b>terms</b> <b>are</b> now considered very offensive.|$|E
50|$|The <b>term</b> <b>is</b> {{also used}} in other countries. For example, in Hispanophone countries, the <b>term</b> <b>is</b> Palacio de los Deportes.|$|R
5000|$|Under {{the total}} {{derivative}} {{with respect to}} proper time, the first <b>term</b> <b>is</b> the relativistic momentum, the second <b>term</b> <b>is</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|A similar <b>term</b> <b>is</b> [...] "vertebral line", which {{defined by}} the spinous processes. However, this <b>term</b> <b>is</b> not in Terminologia Anatomica.|$|R
