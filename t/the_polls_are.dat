25|$|The {{returns of}} every {{election}} for President and Vice President, duly {{certified by the}} board of canvassers of each province or city, shall be transmitted to Congress, directed to the President of the Senate. Upon receipt of the certificates of canvass, the President of the Senate shall open all the certificates {{in the presence of a}} joint public session of Congress not later than 30 days after election day. Congress then canvasses the votes upon determining that <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>are</b> authentic and were done in the manner provided by law.|$|E

25|$|Entropy is {{a measure}} of unpredictability of the state, or equivalently, of its average {{information}} content. To get an intuitive understanding of these terms, consider the example of a political poll. Usually, such <b>polls</b> happen because <b>the</b> outcome of <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> not already known. In other words, the outcome of <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> relatively unpredictable, and actually performing <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> and learning <b>the</b> results gives some new information; these are just different ways of saying that the a priori entropy of <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> results <b>is</b> large. Now, consider the case that <b>the</b> same <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> performed a second time shortly after <b>the</b> first <b>poll.</b> Since <b>the</b> result of <b>the</b> first <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> already known, <b>the</b> outcome of <b>the</b> second <b>poll</b> can <b>be</b> predicted well and the results should not contain much new information; in this case the a priori entropy of <b>the</b> second <b>poll</b> result <b>is</b> small relative to that of the first.|$|R
50|$|In Division I men's and women's college basketball, <b>the</b> AP <b>Poll</b> <b>is</b> largely just a tool {{to compare}} schools {{throughout}} the season and spark debate, as it has no bearing on postseason play. Generally, all top 25 teams in <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> <b>are</b> invited to <b>the</b> men's and women's NCAA basketball tournament, also known as March Madness. <b>The</b> <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> usually released every Monday and voters' ballots are made public.|$|R
500|$|Another {{example of}} Manne's ability {{to transcend the}} narrow borders of any {{particular}} school is the series of trio albums he recorded with guitarist Barney Kessel and bassist Ray Brown as [...] "The Poll Winners". (They had all won numerous polls conducted by the popular publications of the day; <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>are</b> now forgotten, but the albums endure, now reissued on CD.) Manne even dabbled in Dixieland and fusion, as well as [...] "Third Stream" [...] music. He participated in the revival of that jazz precursor ragtime (he appears on several albums devoted {{to the music of}} Scott Joplin), and sometimes recorded with musicians best associated with European classical music. He always, however, returned to the straight-ahead jazz he loved best.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Socialist Party {{can become}} the {{effective}} instrument for bringing about Socialism only if it changes its present principles and tactics. The small growth in membership and the poor showing at <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>are</b> objective evidence that the program and policies of the Party are not adequate. More important, however, the failure of social democracy to take power in Germany, where the Socialists had gained the support {{of large numbers of}} the working people, raises grave questions as to its theoretical soundness." ...|$|E
