5|$|As {{a thought}} {{experiment}} in economics, many international trade economists {{have found this}} simplified and idealized {{version of the story}} important due to its ability to simplify <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of consumer behaviour, producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in public finance the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of public goods and certain aspects of collective benefits. It is used in growth economics to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.|$|E

Final Fantasy X was the first game that allowed for 3-D model rendering of backgrounds that increased the presentation, including small details like grass {{blowing in the wind}} and cloud movement. Takayoshi Nakazato decided to abandon the typical world map concept for a more realistic depiction. Final Fantasy Xs spatial presentation of Spira is tied to progression; with a player's progress being marked through the panoramic introduction and depiction of the area upon first entry. Chiharu Minekawa, the supervising sound editor, commented that the transition in sound from one environment to the next was done seamlessly in order to mimic the natural surroundings of these environments as the player moved through them.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies how {{changes in}} <b>the</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firms' {{production}} technologies affect wage differences between and within tasks. In a production process where tasks are complementary, the employer {{may have an}} incentive to pay higher wages when using more complex technologies because <b>the</b> output <b>of</b> such processes is more effort-sensitive. We use linked employer-employee data from the Finnish metal industry. These data provide quantified information on <b>the</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tasks <b>of</b> individual workers. <b>The</b> average <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tasks in the firm is used as a proxy for <b>the</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> production process.

The segment intended to not only educate CBS' viewers about <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pro game, but also to teach young players how to improve their skills. They also subtly introduced audiences to an all-star team based on Auerbach's criteria such as screening and passing. In a Red on Roundball halftime segment which appeared on CBS' NBA telecasts in the 1973–74 season, Auerbach and referee Mendy Rudolph discussed and demonstrated the practice of flopping with obvious disapproval.|$|E

25|$|By being {{hydrophobic}} and small, or inhibiting astrocyte function, some compounds including certain neurotoxins {{are able}} to penetrate into the brain and induce significant damage. In modern times, scientists and physicians have been presented {{with the challenge of}} identifying and treating neurotoxins, which has resulted in a growing interest in both neurotoxicology research and clinical studies. Though clinical neurotoxicology is largely a burgeoning field, extensive inroads {{have been made in the}} identification of many environmental neurotoxins leading to the classification of 750 to 1000 known potentially neurotoxic compounds. Due to the critical importance of finding neurotoxins in common environments, specific protocols have been developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for testing and determining neurotoxic effects of compounds (USEPA 1998). Additionally, in vitro systems have increased in use as they provide significant improvements over the more common in vivo systems of the past. Examples of improvements include tractable, uniform environments, and the elimination of contaminating effects of systemic metabolism. In vitro systems, however, have presented problems as it has been difficult to properly replicate <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nervous system, such as the interactions between supporting astrocytes and neurons in creating the BBB. To even further complicate the process of determining neurotoxins when testing in-vitro, neurotoxicity and cytotoxicity may be difficult to distinguish as exposing neurons directly to compounds may not be possible in-vivo, as it is in-vitro. Additionally, the response of cells to chemicals may not accurately convey a distinction between neurotoxins and cytotoxins, as symptoms like oxidative stress or skeletal modifications may occur in response to either.|$|E
