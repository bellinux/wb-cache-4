5|$|The {{governor}} has a four-year term, commencing {{on the first}} Monday of the January after an election. The Constitution of Utah originally stated that, should the office of governor be vacant, the power be devolved upon the Secretary of State, but the office of Lieutenant Governor was created in 1976, and a 1980 constitutional amendment added it to the constitution. If the office of governor becomes vacant {{during the first year}} of the <b>term,</b> <b>the</b> lieutenant governor becomes governor until the next general election; if it becomes vacant after the first year of the <b>term,</b> <b>the</b> lieutenant governor becomes governor for the remainder of the <b>term.</b> <b>The</b> offices of governor and lieutenant governor are elected on the same ticket. The Governor of Utah was formerly limited to serving three terms, but all term limit laws were repealed by the Utah Legislature in 2003; Utah is one of the few states where gubernatorial term limits are not determined by the constitution.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{military}} {{victory of the}} absolutist city authorities was complete, the war had also shown them that they depended very much on their rural subjects. Soon after the war, the ruling aristocrats instituted a series of reforms and even lowered some taxes, thus fulfilling some of the peasants' original fiscal demands.

40|$|Abstract: Most of {{the common}} {{techniques}} of text mining {{are based on the}} statistical analysis of <b>the</b> <b>term</b> frequency. <b>The</b> statistical analysis of <b>the</b> <b>term</b> frequency captures <b>the</b> importance of <b>the</b> <b>term</b> within <b>the</b> document only. An alternate approach would be to enhance the mining model to include the contribution of <b>the</b> <b>term</b> to <b>the</b> semantics of the text so that <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> that capture <b>the</b> concepts of the document and thereby the similarity between the documents may be found. The contribution of each <b>term</b> to <b>the</b> semantics at the sentence, document and corpus levels is determined using sentence-based concept-analysis, document-based concept-analysis and corpus-based concept-analysis respectively. A concept-based similarity measure is used to determine the similarity between the documents...|$|R
