Just as his older colleague August Bier (18611949) had done with spinal anesthesia in 1898, Kulenkampff subjected himself to the supraclavicular block. Later that year, Georg Hirschel (18751963) described a percutaneous approach to the brachial plexus from the axilla. In 1928, Kulenkampff and Persky published their experiences with a thousand blocks without apparent major complications.

500|$|Although much of {{the music}} of The Bartered Bride is folk-like, the only {{significant}} use of authentic folk material is in the Act II furiant, with a few other occasional glimpses of basic Czech folk melodies.

Smetana's diary indicates {{that he was trying}} to give the music [...] "a popular character, because the plot [...] is taken from village life and demands a national treatment." [...] According to his biographer John Clapham, Smetana [...] "certainly felt <b>the</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peasantry and knew how to express this in music, yet inevitably he added something of himself."

2500|$|During the First World War, {{into which}} Canada was drawn {{due to its}} {{association}} with the United Kingdom, the governor general's role turned from one of cultural patron and state ceremony to one of military inspector and morale booster. Starting in 1914, Governor General Prince Arthur donned his Field Marshal's uniform and put his efforts into raising contingents, inspecting army camps, and seeing troops off before their voyage to Europe. These actions, however, led to conflict with the Prince's prime minister at the time, Robert Borden; though the latter placed blame on the Military Secretary Edward Stanton, he also opined that the Duke [...] "laboured under the handicap of his position {{as a member of}} the Royal Family and never realized his limitations as Governor General." [...] Prince Arthur's successor, the Duke of Devonshire, faced the Conscription Crisis of 1917 and held discussions with his Canadian prime minister, as well as His Majesty's Loyal Opposition members, on the matter. Once the government implemented conscription, Devonshire, after consulting on <b>the</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation with Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Vincent Massey, Henri Bourassa, Archbishop of Montreal Paul Bruchési, Duncan Campbell Scott, Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and Stephen Leacock, made efforts to conciliate Quebec, though he had little real success.|$|E

[...] This form of Charleston includes a number of positions, including side-by-side, hand-to-hand, and tandem. [...] In [...] "jockey position", the closed position is opened out so that both partners may face forward, without breaking apart. [...] In side-by-side Charleston, partners open the closed position entirely, so that their only points of connection are at their touching hips and arm contact, wherein the leader's right hand and arm touch the follower's back and the follower's left hand and arm touch the leader's shoulder and arm. [...] Both partners then swing their free arms as they would in solo Charleston. In both jockey and side-by-side Charleston, the leader steps back onto his left foot, while the follower steps back onto her right. In tandem Charleston, one partner {{stands in front of the}} other (usually the follower, though the arrangement may vary), both face in the same direction to start, and both begin by stepping back onto the left foot. [...] The partner behind holds the front partner's hands at the latter's hip height, and their joined arms swing backwards and forwards, as in the basic step.|$|E
