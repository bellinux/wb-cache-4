40|$|Interaction of the amido/bis(phosphine) -supported (PNP) Ir {{fragment}} with {{a series}} of linear and cyclic ethers is shown to afford, depending on substrate, products of α,α-dehydrogenation (carbenes), α,β-dehydrogenation (vinyl ethers), or decarbonylation. While carbenes are exclusively obtained from tert-amyl <b>methyl</b> <b>ether,</b> sec-butyl <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> (SBME), n-butyl <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> (NBME), and tetrahydrofuran (THF), vinyl ethers or their adducts are observed upon reaction with diethyl ether and 1, 4 -dioxane. Decarbonylation occurs upon interaction of (PNP) Ir with benzyl <b>methyl</b> <b>ether,</b> and a mechanism is proposed for this unusual transformation, which occurs via a series of C−H, C−O, and C−C bond cleavage events. The intermediates characterized for several of these reactions as well as the α,α-dehydrogenation of tert-butyl <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> (MTBE) are used to outline a reaction pathway for the generation of PNP-supported iridium(I) carbene complexes, and it is shown that the long-lived, observable intermediates are substrate-dependent and differ for the related cases of MTBE and THF.

The Moller-Plesset (MP 2) method with the 6 - 311 G(d,p) basis set has been employed in the geometry optimizations and frequency calculations of all of the species involved in the above reaction systems. The connections between each transition state and the corresponding local minima have been determined by intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations. Energies are reported at the CCSD(T) /cc-pVTZ level of theory and include the zero-point energy corrections. As a benchmark in the electronic energy calculations, the CCSD(T) /CBS extrapolation was used for the reactions of dimethyl ether + H(O) over dot(2) radicals. A systematic calculation of the high-pressure limit rate constants has been performed using conventional transition-state theory, including asymmetric Eckart tunneling corrections, in the temperature range of 500 - 2000 K. The one dimensional hindrance potentials obtained at MP 2 / 6 - 311 G(d,p) for the reactants and transition states have been used to describe the low frequency torsional modes. Herein, we report the calculated individual, average, and total rate constants. A branching ratio analysis for every reaction site has also been performed.
