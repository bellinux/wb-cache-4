40|$|The {{development}} of independent and innovative thinking entails {{much more than}} merely the acquisition of a series <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> skills. A comprehensive approach based upon inter-disciplinary cooperation between, among others, the disciplines of philosophy, education and pscychology is needed. In such a comprehensive approach to the development <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> skills the following factors that have a bearing on the acquisition <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> skills should be addressed: The cultivation of a positive disposition towards the development <b>of</b> <b>thinking.</b> The creation <b>of</b> conditions conducive to the development <b>of</b> <b>thinking.</b> The cultivation <b>of</b> virtues that will dispose a person towards good <b>thinking.</b> An understanding <b>of</b> what good <b>thinking</b> entails. The teaching and assessment <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> skills. In this article, these various factors and their bearing on the development <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> skills are explored. A general theoretical framework for the development <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> skills is proposed that {{can and should be}} translated to specific domains of knowledge or to specific human enterprises. </p...|$|R

The thinking process was the thought process of assimilation and accommodation in solving mathematical problems based on the type of Krulik and Rudnick on a straight-line equation. The technique of data collection that used was snowball-sampling which the subject stopped when data saturation. Obtained three extrovert students and three introvert students. The validation of data was carried out with time triangulation. The result of research showed that the <b>thinking</b> process <b>of</b> extrovert students in solving mathematical problems based on the type of Krulik and Rudnick step was as follows 1) In read and think step, the used <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> process was assimilation; 2) In explore and plan step, the used <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> process was imperfect assimilation; 3) In select a strategy step, the used <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> process was imperfect assimilation; 4) In find an answer step, the used <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> process was imperfect assimilation; 5) In reflect and extend step, the used <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> process was accommodation.
