Such scenes included a coworker showing Jim photographs of her baby, Dwight telling everyone to delete their records of Ed Truck, Michael <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> need for a grief counselor, Toby holding a grief counseling session for the office, and Roy telling Pam {{of the birth of}} a cousin's twins.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence {{was alarmed}} by the Soviet Union's first nuclear test in August 1949. The proper response, he concluded, was an all-out effort to build a bigger nuclear weapon: the {{hydrogen}} bomb. Lawrence proposed to use accelerators instead of nuclear reactors to produce the neutrons needed to create the tritium the bomb required, as well as plutonium, which was more difficult, as much higher energies would be required. He first proposed the construction of Mark I, a prototype $7 million, 25 MeV linear accelerator, codenamed Materials Test Accelerator (MTA). He was soon <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> new, even larger MTA known as the Mark II, which could produce tritium or plutonium from depleted uranium-238. Serber and Segré attempted in vain to explain the technical problems that made it impractical, but Lawrence {{felt that they were}} being unpatriotic.|$|E
5|$|Veronica and Tim {{investigate}} Hank’s alibi further, and it checks out, {{leading to}} his release. Veronica and Tim find secret phone recordings kept by Hank. Veronica brings Keith the CD, but he informs her that Hank has disappeared as well. We see Hank {{showing up on}} Mindy’s boat. While listening to the phone calls, Veronica notices Mindy and Hank <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> place named “Papa’s cabin”. They investigate the most recent phone calls made by Hank, and find that his alibi was faked—he was helping the witness’s son escape foster care. Keith comes {{up with the idea}} that Papa’s cabin {{has something to do with}} Ernest Hemingway. Keith visits the cabin, a retreat in Central America, before boarding the motorboat. He finds Hank, who says that he was working with her to kill the Dean. He says that he and Mindy had a fight, and Mindy fell overboard. We see Mindy’s body washed up on a beach.|$|E

5|$|Confusion reigned {{over just}} what {{experiments}} had been conducted. Pusztai had mentioned {{two lines of}} genetically modified potatoes, meaning the two GNA lines, and this was reported by the media. The Rowett institute mistakenly assumed the media was <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> second line transformed with concanavalin A (ConA), a Jack Bean lectin that is toxic to mammals. Transgenic ConA Potatoes had been developed, but had never been tested. Two press releases issued by the Rowett Institute on the 10th and 11th praised Pusztai's research and supported increased safety tests on genetically modified food. The press releases {{also said that the}} potatoes were modified with ConA, adding to the confusion. Pusztai claimed that he had not seen the press releases before they went out and had no opportunity to correct the mistake. James says that he drafted it and Pusztai rewrote one section, but did not see the final copy. The mistaken belief that the ConA gene was inserted into the potato led scientist Sir Robert May and Agricultural Minister Jack Cunningham to release statements to the media saying that the findings were not surprising, as a known poison had been added to the potato. Some scientists still dismiss Pusztai's work over this error.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the game}} was {{released}} the developers were <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> 16-way multiplayer.

Hardstark approached Kilgariff with interest and talked all night about various murders throughout history. In January 2016 they released their first episode of My Favorite Murder with Feral Audio. In September 2017, the podcast left Feral Audio and signed with Midroll Media and their episodes were moved to play on iTunes and Stitcher.|$|E
25|$|The steel wage panel {{recessed}} {{for three}} weeks after its opening hearings {{in order to allow}} the employers time to make their arguments. In the interim, OPS announced it was granting the steelmakers a price increase of $2 to $3 per ton—even though they had not applied for it. OPS chief DiSalle hoped that the price increase would placate the employers and relieve pressure on the steel wage panel. But the employers began publicly <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> price increase of $6 to $9 per ton, and the stratagem failed.|$|E

25|$|It is {{convenient}} when <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> set X of natural numbers {{to view it}} as a sequence x0,x1,x2,... of bits, with x'i= 1 if and only if i ∈ X. This viewpoint will make it easier to talk about subalgebras of the power set algebra 2N, which this viewpoint makes the Boolean algebra of all sequences of bits. It also fits well with the columns of a truth table: when a column is read from top to bottom it constitutes a sequence of bits, {{but at the same time}} it can be viewed as the set of those valuations (assignments to variables in the left half of the table) at which the function represented by that column evaluates to 1.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} Moorer fight, Foreman began <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> {{potential}} superfight against Mike Tyson (the youngest ever heavyweight champ). The WBA organization, however, demanded he fight their No. 1 challenger, {{who at the}} time was the competent but aging Tony Tucker. For reasons not clearly known, Foreman refused to fight Tucker and allowed the WBA to strip him of that belt. He then went on to fight mid-level prospect Axel Schulz of Germany in defense of his remaining IBF title. Schulz was a major underdog. Schulz jabbed strongly from long range and grew increasingly confident as the fight progressed. Foreman finished the fight with a swelling over one eye, but was awarded a controversial majority decision. The IBF ordered an immediate rematch to be held in Germany, but Foreman refused the terms and found himself stripped of his remaining title. However, Foreman continued to be recognized as the Lineal Heavyweight Champion.|$|E
25|$|Building on {{the wide}} {{understanding}} of culture brought about by cultural anthropology, archeology and biology, Mosterín has developed a new philosophical understanding of what culture is, where it is localized and how it evolves in time. Human nature is information, and so is human culture, but both are distinguished by their different means of transmission: whereas nature is transmitted genetically and is encoded in the genome, culture is transmitted through social learning and is encoded in the brain. Only individuals have a brain, and only they have a culture. Talk of collective cultures has {{to be understood as}} a statistical artifact for <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> plurality of individual cultures. The set of elementary chunks of culture (variously known as memes, cultural variants or cultural traits) codified as neuronal circuits in the long term memory of the individual make up that individual’s culture. Corresponding to the different uses of ‘culture’ in ordinary and scientific language, Mosterín defines several notions of collective culture, going from the cultural pool (the union of the cultures of all individuals of the group) to the unanimous culture (the intersection of all those cultures). In 2009 he has completed a thoroughgoing analysis of the forces driving cultural change, paying special attention to the role of Internet and other factors of information technology. He considers that preserving the freedom and efficiency of Internet is crucial for the future thriving of human culture.|$|E

500|$|The {{journalist}} Dave Besseling of GQ, in 2014, described Kapoor as [...] "friendly, chirpy, affable frat-boy type. Someone you’d {{want to play}} {{video games}} with on a Sunday, but keep the hell away from your sister". However, certain media publications have labelled Kapoor a recluse and described him as arrogant and temperamental. Vickey Lalwani of Mumbai Mirror wrote in 2012 that this perceived media image hindered certain filmmakers from approaching him for roles. Addressing this image, Kapoor remarked, [...] "I just don’t socialise much, I don’t party too much, I don’t {{know what to say}} to the media if I’m not <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> film that I am doing, so yeah, maybe I am perceived as a snob." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hanky Panky" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{recording}} artist Madonna from her soundtrack album I'm Breathless. It was released on June 12, 1990, by Sire Records as the album's second and final single. Written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, the song was developed from {{a line in the}} parent film, Dick Tracy, <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> woman who enjoys being spanked by her partner. Performed in an almost comical style, [...] "Hanky Panky" [...] is a jazz and swing song with a changing bassline and minor to major key-shift in the chorus. It caused some controversy in Ireland because of its innuendo and racy lyrics, with women's groups deeming them as harmful; Madonna later clarified that the lyrics were intended as a joke.|$|E
