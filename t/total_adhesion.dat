40|$|Introduction: Intraperitoneal adhesions {{are common}} after {{abdominal}} surgery and {{may lead to}} serious clinical complications. Previous studies have investigated the possible effects of the polypeptides poly-L-lysine (αPL) and poly-L-glutamate (PG) forming a polymer complex that prohibits local peritoneal adhesions after surgery. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine whether the normal process of peritoneal healing was affected by PL/PG polymer matrix. Material and methods: Male rats (Sprague Dawley) (n= 84) underwent abdominal wall surgery and suturing. Rats were randomized in groups according to evaluation time (2, 4, 6, 8, 24 hours and 7 days) with corresponding control groups. Controls received saline (0. 9 %) and the experimental groups received PL/PG on the surgery site. tPA, PAI- 1, IL- 6 and active TGFb 1 were analyzed at given time points postoperatively in peritoneal lavage. Adhesions were evaluated after seven days. Significant differences were considered to be p< 0. 05. Results: At a few individual time points small differences were seen between the groups (control and experiment) comparing levels of tPA, PAI- 1, IL- 6 and active TGFb 1. When comparing levels of substances from all time points no statistical differences were seen between the groups as a <b>total.</b> <b>Adhesions</b> were significantly decreased on day 7, p= 0. 002.

40|$|The {{adhesion}} force due to capillary interaction between two hydrophilic surfaces is strongly {{dependent on the}} partial pressure of water and is often calculated using the Kelvin equation. The validity of the Kelvin equation is questionable at low relative humidity (RH) of water, like in high vacuum and dry nitrogen environments, where water is only present as layers of several molecules thick at the surfaces. A model from ordered to bulk form of water has been developed using the Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller adsorption model. The results show that the {{adhesion force}} calculated using the Young–Laplace and Kelvin equations at low (5 – 30 %) RH is underestimated. The <b>total</b> <b>adhesion</b> force shows changes when the RH is changed from 0 to 100 %. In dry conditions, at RH below 10 %, the <b>total</b> <b>adhesion</b> force is contributed by the van der Waals interaction due to solid–solid contact.

The <b>total</b> <b>adhesion</b> force further increases slowly with the increase in RH incorporating capillary forces and then decreases at very high RH due to screening of van der Waals forces. This change in adhesion force occurs from solid–solid interaction to ordered form of water at low RH and from ordered form to bulk form of water at high RH along with the screening effect of van der Waals interaction.

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the prevalence, extent, and location of adhesion formation following microsurgical monopolar laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) among fertile and infertile women with clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovaries (PCO). The design was a longitudinal cohort follow-up study. The study was performed at the endoscopic unit of a tertiary university center. Three hundred and forty-seven patients with PCO were scheduled for LOD as a treatment option for clomiphene-resistant anovulation. Microsurgical monopolar LOD was performed in all cases. Two hundred and forty-six patients without possible additional predisposing factor for postoperative adhesion formation were followed up. To assess the sole effect of LOD on adhesion formation, only 51 eligible patients were classified into two groups; Group A comprised 22 women who conceived within 6  months following LOD and subjected to cesarean section, while group B included 29 women who failed to conceive over the same period of time and subjected to second-look laparoscopy. The main outcome measure was an evaluation of the prevalence, side, site, and severity of pelvic adhesions following microsurgical monopolar LOD. In <b>total,</b> <b>adhesions</b> were diagnosed in 40 cases (78.4 %). Adhesions were diagnosed in 15 cases (68.1 %) and 25 cases (86.2 %) in groups A and B, respectively, without a statistically significant difference (p[*]=[*] 0.21). Periovarian adhesions were diagnosed in 47 / 51 (92 %) of cases in both groups. In 29 (56.8 %) cases in both groups, adhesions were diagnosed on both sides (right and left adnexae) divided as eight (36.3 %) and 21 (72.4 %) in groups A and B, respectively, with a statistically significant difference (p[*]=[*] 0.01). The documented high prevalence of adhesions among infertile as well as women who conceived following LOD is an added evidence to the established risk of post-LOD adhesion formation. Following microsurgical principles would minimize the risk of these adhesions except periovarian adhesions. There is a bad need for studies on more refinement of LOD to make it as less adhesiogenic procedure as possible.|$|R
40|$|Platelet {{adhesion}} {{has been}} measured to type-I monomeric collagen, collagen fibres, alpha 1 (I) and alpha 2 (I) chains and the chain fragments alpha 1 (I) CB 3, alpha 1 (I) CB 6, alpha 1 (I) CB 7 and alpha 1 (I) CB 8, and alpha 2 (I) CB 3, 5 and alpha 2 (I) CB 4. Little if any adhesion occurred to any denatured species at 37 degrees C, demonstrating {{the importance of}} the collagen helix. However, on coating at 4 degrees C to promote helix formation, and assaying at room temperature to avoid denaturation, adhesion was observed to both alpha-chain types and all fragments, the exact level of which depended on the identity of the species in question. Adhesion was strongly Mg(2 +) -dependent. Antibodies against the integrin alpha 2 beta 1 partially inhibited adhesion to alpha-chains and all fragments except alpha 1 (I) CB 6, indicating a wide distribution of alpha 2 beta 1 -binding sites in the collagen molecule. 'Activation-dependent' adhesion to monomeric collagen, totally secondary to alpha 2 beta 1 -mediated adhesion, involved at least two mechanisms, one mediated by integrin alpha IIb beta 3 and insensitive to prostaglandin E 1, the other inhibitable by prostaglandin E 1 but independent of integrin alpha IIb beta 3. alpha IIb beta 3 -mediated adhesion to fragments was, at least in part, independent of the alpha 2 beta 1 -mediated adhesion.

40|$|Cell-to-extracellular matrix {{adhesion}} {{is regulated}} by {{a multitude of}} pathways initiated distally to the core cell–matrix adhesion machinery, such as via growth factor signaling. In contrast to these extrinsically sourced pathways, we now identify a regulatory pathway that is intrinsic to the core adhesion machinery, providing an internal regulatory feedback loop to fine tune adhesion levels. This autoinhibitory negative feedback loop is initiated by cell adhesion to vitronectin, leading to PAK 4 activation, which in turn limits <b>total</b> cell–vitronectin <b>adhesion</b> strength. Specifically, we show that PAK 4 is activated by cell attachment to vitronectin as mediated by PAK 4 binding partner integrin v 5, and that active PAK 4 induces accelerated integrin v 5 turnover within adhesion complexes. Accelerated integrin turnover is associated with additional PAK 4 -mediated effects, including inhibited integrin v 5 clustering, reduced integrin to F-actin connectivity and perturbed adhesion complex maturation. These specific outcomes are ultimately associated with reduced cell adhesion strength and increased cell motility. We thus demonstrate a novel mechanism deployed by cells to tune cell adhesion levels through the autoinhibitory regulation of integrin adhesion...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Abdominal adhesions and abscesses are a {{major source}} of {{morbidity}} and mortality after abdominal surgery and peritonitis. Adhesions are hard to detect with standard imaging techniques. Liposomes, coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), represent an agent developed for infection imaging. This study investigated the capacity of 99 mTc-PEG-liposomes to localize early adhesion formation after peritonitis. Additionally, the value of 99 mTc-PEG-liposomes for therapy evaluation of hyaluronan solution, which reduces adhesion and abscess formation in experimental peritonitis, was assessed. METHODS: In 24 rats, a bacterial peritonitis was induced by performing a cecal ligation and puncture procedure. The animals were treated with sodium chloride solution or 0. 4 % hyaluronan solution intra-abdominally. One week later, scintigraphy was performed using 99 mTc-PEG-liposomes, and abnormal focal uptake in the abdomen was scored. Thereafter, autopsy was performed and adhesions and abscesses were scored. RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between the <b>total</b> <b>adhesion</b> score and the scintigraphic score (P < 0. 01, r = 0. 65). Treatment with hyaluronan significantly reduced the <b>total</b> <b>adhesion</b> score (P = 0. 01). The size of abscesses significantly correlated with the scintigraphic score (P < 0. 01, r = 0. 65).

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that podocytes unable to assemble heparan sulfate on cell surface proteoglycan core proteins have compromised cell-matrix interactions. This report further explores the role of N-sulfation of intact heparan chains in podocyte-matrix interactions. For the purposes of this study, a murine model in which the enzyme N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase 1 (NDST 1) was specifically deleted in podocytes and immortalized podocyte cell lines lacking NDST 1 were developed and used to explore the effects of such a mutation on podocyte behavior in vitro. NDST 1 is a bifunctional enzyme, ultimately responsible for N-sulfation of heparan glycosaminoglycans produced by cells. Immunostaining of glomeruli from mice whose podocytes were null for Ndst 1 (Ndst 1 (-/-)) showed a disrupted pattern of localization for the cell surface proteoglycan, syndecan- 4, and for alpha-actinin- 4 compared with controls. The pattern of immunostaining for synaptopodin and nephrin did not show as significant alterations. In vitro studies showed that Ndst 1 (-/-) podocytes attached, spread, and migrated less efficiently than Ndst 1 (+/+) podocytes. Immunostaining in vitro for several markers for molecules involved in cell-matrix interactions showed that Ndst 1 (-/-) cells had decreased clustering of syndecan- 4 and decreased recruitment of protein kinase-Calpha, alpha-actinin- 4, vinculin, and phospho-focal adhesion kinase to focal <b>adhesions.</b> <b>Total</b> intracellular phospho-focal <b>adhesion</b> kinase was decreased in Ndst 1 (-/-) compared with Ndst 1 (+/+) cells.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The immune {{response}} combines {{a series of}} signals and complex mechanisms to occur, which can be modulated and enhanced. This one according the popular knowledge is possible using plant extracts, being one of them the plant extract JV- 001. This showed, in previous studies, the ability to activate and enhance the cellular {{immune response}} of murine origin, but its effect on human leukocyte level is unknown, so {{the objective of this}} work was to study the effect of JV- 001 in human leukocytes. MATERIAL AND METHOD: In this paper was used heparinized blood of healthy males, at first instance, this was treated with NH 4 Cl 64 % to obtain total leukocytes, and in another, separate the mononuclear fraction by Histopaque® gradient. The cells obtained were adjusted to 8 x 106; aliquots of 100 µL of JV- 001 or PBS. The plate was incubated at 37 ºC for 30 minutes and then washed, the peroxidase remaining in each recipient was revealed and determined with Orthophenylenediamine and H 2 O 2, expressing the proceeds as absorbance read at 450 nm. RESULTS: The results showed an increase in <b>total</b> leukocyte <b>adhesion</b> between 44. 35 % and 63. 3 %, expressed by obtaining a positive delta absorbance with respect to controls. DISCUSSION: The mechanism that increases the adhesion is unknown, but probably due to increased expression of integrins.

In this work, responses of Mytilus hemocytes to heat-killedVibrio splendidus LGP 32 and the mechanisms involved were investigated in vitro {{and the results were}} compared with those obtained with Vibrio anguillarum (ATCC 19264). Adhesion of hemocytes after incubation with bacteria was evaluated by flow cytometry: both total hemocyte counts (THC) and percentage of hemocyte sub-populations were determined in non-adherent cells. Functional parameters such as lysosomal membrane stability, lysozyme release, extracellular ROS production and NO production were evaluated, as well as the phosphorylation state of the stress-activated p 38 MAPK and PKC. Neither Vibrio affected <b>total</b> hemocyte <b>adhesion,</b> while both induced similar lysosomal destabilization and NO production. However, V. splendidus decreased adhesion of large granulocytes, induced rapid and persistent lysozyme release and stimulated extracellular ROS production: these effects were associated with persistent activation of p 38 MAPK and PKC. In contrast, V. anguillarum decreased adhesion of large semigranular hemocytes and increased that of hyalinocytes,had no effect on the extracellular ROS production, and induced significantly lower lysozyme release and phosphorylation of p- 38 MAPK and PKC than V. splendidus. These data reinforced the existence of specific interactions between mussel hemocytes and V. splendidus LGP 32 and suggest that this Vibrio strain affects bivalve hemocytes through disregulation of immune signaling. The results support the hypothesis that responses of bivalve hemocytes to different bacterial stimuli may depend not only {{on the nature of the}} stimulus, but also on the cell subtype, thus leading to differential activation of signaling components...|$|R

All interactive systems showed decreases in the extent of interaction during storage over 23 days with the type of drug-carrier system influencing the rate of adhesive change. Good correlation was obtained between the <b>total</b> <b>adhesion</b> and the electrostatic charge produced on particle detachment. A theoretical model was developed which allowed the estimation of the non-electrical interactive force contribution of each drug system...|$|E
40|$|Background: Postoperative peritoneal adhesions form in 63 – 97 % of patients, {{give rise}} to {{subsequent}} adhesion related problems and create a considerable socioeconomic burden. In the present study, a local artificial atmosphere was created around the abdominal cavity during a surgical procedure {{in an effort to}} reduce postoperative adhesion formation. Methods: Forty-eight Wistar male rats (Clr:WI) were randomized into two groups and weighed about 280 grams each. The abdominal cavities of the rats of the study group were exposed to warm and humidified air (21 % O 2, 37 [*]°C, 95 – 100 % relative humidity (RH)) during an open surgical procedure, while the rats of the control group were exposed to the air from the operating theatre (21 % O 2, 21 [*]°C, 40 – 47 % RH). The surgical procedure consisted of a midline laparotomy, four cuts and ischaemic knots in the anterior abdominal wall and blood from the tail vein dripped into the abdominal cavity. The abdominal cavity was assessed for adhesion formation and the bacterial load (CFU/ml) was measured. Results: Significant differences in mean <b>total</b> <b>adhesion,</b> severity, tenacity scores and in the mean rank of the extent scores were found (p< 0. 001). Also, significant differences in the median numbers of CFU/ml on chocolate agar and blood agar were found (p< 0. 001). Conclusions: Rats in the study group had higher <b>total</b> <b>adhesion,</b> extent, severity and tenacity scores postoperatively compared to rats in the control group. A possible reason could be the observed higher bacterial load amongst the rats of the study group compared to the rats of the control group...|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} our study showed that at repeat CS, adhesions were found mainly between the uterus and the bladder, and between the uterus and the {{anterior}} abdominal wall. This is in agreement with previous reports [3, 4]. Adhesions on these areas were also more severe after ≥ 2 CSs than after one cesarean. As previously suggested [3], {{it is very likely}} that the presence of these adhesions increases the incision–delivery interval delaying the birth of the newborn. In theory, it might be deleterious {{to the health of the}} baby. Yet in our series, we did not find any correlation between the <b>total</b> <b>adhesion</b> score and fetal cord pH. A much larger study is needed to clarify this matter. Besides increased incision–delivery interval, it also took longer to complete surgery at repeat CS. Again, this is related to increased adhesion score.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Adhesion {{formation}} after pelvic {{surgery is}} still {{a major cause of}} several morbidities such as infertility, pain, bowel obstruction and subsequent intra-operative complications. Our aim was to investigate the effects of d-penicillamine in preventing adhesion formation in rat uterine horn. &# 13; METHODS: This experimental trial was conducted on 30 rats. The rats were randomly assigned to two groups of 15. Measurable serosal injury was created using a standard technique. The rats in one of the two groups were given 17 mg/kg of d-penicillamine. All of the animals were operated on 4 weeks after surgery and adhesions were assessed and scored by an examiner who was blind to the test. &# 13; RESULTS: Frequency of severe adhesions in control and case groups were 76 and zero percent, respectively. <b>Total</b> scores of <b>adhesions</b> were found to be significantly reduced in the d-penicillamine treatment group when compared with control group (P = 0). &# 13; CONCLUSION: This study showed that penicillamine can decrease the chance of post-operative intra-peritoneal adhesion formation. &# 13; KEY WORDS: Adhesion formation, d-penicillamine, pelvis...|$|R
40|$|Adhesions after {{endoscopic}} sinus surgery (ESS) are {{a potential}} cause of surgical failure. Mitomycin-C (MMC) is recently proposed {{as a solution}} for these adhesions. This study was performed to investigate the effect of Mitomycin C in reducing scar formation and adhesion in the nasal mucosa after endoscopic nasal surgery. This double blind randomized clinical trial study was performed on 37 patients with bilateral chronic rhinosinusitis. At the end of ESS, randomly impregnated mesh with MMC was placed in one side and another mesh impregnated with saline in the opposite side for 5 minutes. Patients were followed at least for three months, {{and the results of}} diagnostic endoscopy were recorded. Post operative adhesion occurred in 12 (32. 4 %) patients (2 bilateral/ 10 unilateral). Among <b>total</b> of 14 <b>adhesions,</b> 4 (10. 8 %) were in the MMC side and 10 (27 %) in the control side. This differences was close to statistically significant (P= 0. 058). MMC may reduce adhesions after ESS, but further studies with different doses, sample size and frequent use of topical MMC is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Integrins {{link the}} {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) with the intracellular cytoskeleton and other cell adhesion-associated signaling proteins {{to function as}} mechanotransducers. However, direct quantitative measurements of the cardiomyocyte mechanical state {{and its relationship to}} the interactions between specific ECM proteins and integrins are lacking. The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize the interactions between the ECM protein fibronectin (FN) and integrins in cardiomyocytes and to test the hypothesis that these interactions would vary during contraction and relaxation states in cardiomyocytes. Using atomic force microscopy, we quantified the unbinding force (adhesion force) and adhesion probability between integrins and FN and correlated these measurements with the contractile state as indexed by cell stiffness on freshly isolated mouse cardiomyocytes. Experiments were performed in normal physiological (control), high-K+ (tonically contracted), or low-Ca 2 + (fully relaxed) solutions. Under control conditions, the initial peak of adhesion force between FN and myocyte α 3 β 1 - and/or α 5 β 1 -integrins was 39. 6 ± 1. 3 pN. The binding specificity between FN and α 3 β 1 - and α 5 β 1 -integrins was verified by using monoclonal antibodies against α 3 -, α 5 -, α 3 + α 5 -, or β 1 -integrin subunits, which inhibited binding by 48 %, 65 %, 70 %, or 75 %, respectively. Cytochalasin D or 2, 3 -butanedione monoxime (BDM), to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton or block myofilament function, respectively, significantly decreased the cell stiffness; however, the adhesion force and binding probability were not altered. Tonic contraction with high-K+ solution increased <b>total</b> cell <b>adhesion</b> (1. 2 -fold) and cell stiffness (27. 5 -fold) compared with fully relaxed cells with low-Ca 2 + solution. However, it could be partially prevented by high-K+ bath solution containing BDM, which suppresses contraction by inhibiting the actin-myosin interactions. Thus, our results demonstrate that integrin binding to FN is modulated by the contractile state of cardiac myocytes...|$|R
