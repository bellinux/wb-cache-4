5|$|Traditionally, Oslo had two stations, {{the larger}} Oslo East Station (or OsloØ, {{located at the}} spot of the current OsloS) and Oslo West Station (OsloV), which served the Drammen Line. This caused a {{physical}} barrier between the {{two parts of the}} railway network, only connected by the Oslo Port Line which ran partly in city streets. Formal planning of a central station and a tunnel connecting the Drammen Line to OsloØ started in 1938, and the final plans were approved in 1968. The Oslo Tunnel opened on 1 June 1980, and made it possible to close OsloV in 1989. Nationaltheatret saw a major upgrade in 1999, when it was expanded to four tracks, and from 2008 to 2010, the tunnel will see a major technical upgrade. There are plans to build a second tunnel to increase <b>train</b> <b>capacity</b> west of Oslo.|$|E

This research examined how a shared learning model may affect <b>training</b> <b>capacity.</b> Methods The number of learners requiring general practice placements creates supervisory capacity constraints. This research examined how a shared learning model may affect <b>training</b> <b>capacity.</b> Results A total of 1122 surveys were completed: 75 % of learners {{had participated in}} shared learning; 25 % of multi-level learner practices were not using shared learning. Learners were positive about shared learning (4. 3 - 4. 4 / 5), considering it {{an effective way to}} learn that created <b>training</b> <b>capacity</b> (4. 1 - 4. 2 / 5). 79 - 88 % of learners preferred a mixture of one-to-one teaching and shared learning. Supervisors thought shared learning was more cost- and time-efficient, and created <b>training</b> <b>capacity</b> (4. 3 - 4. 4 / 5). Discussion Shared learning models have the potential to increase GP <b>training</b> <b>capacity.</b> Many practices are not utilising shared learning, representing <b>capacity</b> loss. Regional <b>training</b> providers should emphasise positive aspects of shared learning to facilitate uptake. Griffith Health, School of Nursing and MidwiferyFull Tex...|$|R
25|$|In June 1987, a new storage yard, the West Side Yard, was opened. The {{yard was}} {{built as a}} result of <b>train</b> <b>capacity</b> issues at Penn Station that forced {{terminating}} LIRR trains to make unneeded non-passenger trips to storage yards on Long Island during midday. The West Side Yard, once opened, immediately increased <b>train</b> <b>capacity</b> through Penn Station. The yard is located between West 30th Street, West 33rd Street, 10th Avenue, and 12th Avenue, and it was previously used as a rail yard and freight terminal for the New York Central and later on the Penn Central until the 1970s. The yard was bought by the LIRR in 1980 and it built a new 30-track yard with a tunnel connection to Penn Station. The new yard permitted midday and overnight storage and the cleaning and inspection of 320 cars, which formerly had to be shuttled to yard locations at Jamaica or as far east as Babylon. The West Side Yard is named after John D. Caemmerer, a New York State Senator from East Williston who helped obtain $195.7 million for its construction. A state-of-the-art repair facility at Hillside was opened in 1989, exactly 100 years after the Morris Park shops opened, at a cost of $380 million.|$|E
25|$|In the New York {{metropolitan}} area, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) {{operates the}} New York City Subway, which is mostly manually operated. The subway system currently uses Automatic Block Signaling with fixed wayside signals and automatic train stops. Many {{portions of the}} signaling system were installed between the 1930s and 1960s. Because {{of the age of}} the subway system, some replacement parts must be custom built for the MTA, as they are otherwise unavailable from signaling suppliers. Additionally, some subway services have reached their <b>train</b> <b>capacity</b> limits and cannot operate extra trains with the current Automatic Block Signaling system.|$|E
25|$|The Gateway Program is {{the planned}} phased {{expansion}} and {{renovation of the}} Northeast Corridor (NEC) rail line between Newark, New Jersey, and New York City, New York. The proposed project would cost about 20 billion dollars and would be completed in 2026. Once completed the improvements would double <b>train</b> <b>capacity</b> (25 extra trains per hour) and would allow for additional high-speed rail service. The existing two-track rail line used by both Amtrak (AMTK) and New Jersey Transit (NJT) has reached full capacity.

500|$|The {{line was}} also delayed to {{disagreements}} over {{the quality of}} concrete and the leakage of water into the tunnels, the speed of construction, and the federal Urban Mass Transportation Administration's reluctance to provide funding for the line based on the tunnels' condition. Still, construction was completed a year ahead of schedule, in 1983. Due to the city's fiscal crisis, the planned subway line was truncated to Jamaica Center–Parsons/Archer, with provisions existing for the planned extension of the upper level along the LIRR Locust Manor right-of-way. The line opened on December 11, 1988, {{at a cost of}} nearly five times its original budgeted cost, and severely cut back to a length of [...] Since the line had been abridged to Jamaica Center, the [...] "modern terminal" [...] at Springfield Gardens had not been built, severely reducing <b>train</b> <b>capacity</b> on both levels to twelve trains per hour.|$|E

Additionally, some subway services have reached their <b>train</b> <b>capacity</b> limits and cannot operate extra trains with the current Automatic Block Signaling system.

2500|$|During the {{reconstruction}} of the junction that started in 1956 and was completed by April 1961, the Brighton Line tracks were connected to the DeKalb Avenue station's outermost tracks. A diamond crossover north of the station had caused frequent bottlenecks, but was removed during the realignment and replaced with two flying junctions. All switches immediately north of the station were eliminated. The junction towards the Manhattan Bridge was rebuilt. To make room for a new flying junction, the Myrtle Avenue station was closed on July 16, 1956. That station's northbound platform remains visible from passing trains, but the southbound platform was demolished to accommodate the new flying junction that replaced the diamond crossover. Between 1957 and 1958, extra tracks and new switches were added south of DeKalb Avenue. Platforms were also doubled in length to accommodate ten-car trains of [...] cars. It was estimated that {{the reconstruction}} of the junction increased the junction's <b>train</b> <b>capacity</b> by 25%. The Chrystie Street Connection project was also tied to this improvement, as it resulted in more trains using the bridge, as well as connecting trains to the IND Sixth Avenue Line (and thus, to IND lines to the Bronx and Queens).|$|E
