5|$|The Constitutional Convention convened by the Articles of Confederation Congress in 1787 {{provided}} for a ratification {{process in the}} states that was duly transmitted by Congress to each state. As Virginians went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> to elect delegates to its state convention, six states had ratified including the two other largest states of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. But Virginia bisected the new nation from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River; its admission into the prospective union was critical if the United States as a nation-state were to have contiguous continental territory.|$|E
5|$|To {{expand his}} power, Napoleon used these {{assassination}} plots {{to justify the}} creation of an imperial system based on the Roman model. He believed that a Bourbon restoration would be more difficult if his family's succession was entrenched in the constitution. Launching yet another referendum, Napoleon was elected as Emperor of the French by a tally exceeding 99%. As with the Life Consulate two years earlier, this referendum produced heavy participation, bringing out almost 3.6 million voters <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the Act's initial {{success in}} combating tactics {{designed}} to deny minorities access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls,</b> the Act became predominately {{used as a}} tool to challenge racial vote dilution. Starting in the 1970s, the Attorney General commonly raised Section 5 objections to voting changes that decreased the effectiveness of racial minorities' votes, including discriminatory annexations, redistricting plans, and election methods such as at-large election systems, runoff election requirements, and prohibitions on bullet voting. In total, 81% (2,541) of preclearance objections made between 1965 and 2006 were based on vote dilution. Claims brought under Section 2 have also predominately concerned vote dilution. Between the 1982 creation of the Section 2 results test and 2006, at least 331 Section 2 lawsuits resulted in published judicial opinions. In the 1980s, 60% of Section 2 lawsuits challenged at-large election systems; in the 1990s, 37.2% challenged at-large election systems and 38.5% challenged redistricting plans. Overall, plaintiffs succeeded in 37.2% of the 331 lawsuits, and {{they were more likely to}} succeed in lawsuits brought against covered jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Field's {{government}} {{was startled by}} Britain's announcement in October 1963 that Nyasaland would become fully independent on 6 July 1964. While no date was set for Northern Rhodesian statehood, it was generally surmised {{that it was going}} to follow shortly thereafter. Smith was promptly sent to London, where he held a round of inconclusive Southern Rhodesian independence talks with the new British Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Around the same time, the presence and significance of Section 111 of the 1961 constitution emerged in Southern Rhodesia, prompting speculation in political circles that a future British government might, if it were so inclined, go against previous conventions by legislating for Salisbury without its consent, withdrawing devolved powers or otherwise altering the Southern Rhodesian constitution. Fearing what the Labour Party might do if it won the next British general election (which was projected for late 1964), the Southern Rhodesians stepped up their efforts, hoping to win independence before Britain went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls,</b> and preferably not after Nyasaland. The Federation dissolved as scheduled at the end of 1963.|$|E
5|$|In January 1858, Stone {{staged a}} highly publicized protest that took the issue of {{taxation}} without representation across the nation. The previous summer she and Blackwell had purchased a house in Orange, New Jersey, and when the first tax bill came, Stone returned it unpaid with the explanation that taxing women while denying {{them the right to}} vote was a violation of America’s founding principles. On January 22, 1858, the city auctioned some of her household goods to pay the tax and attendant court costs. The following month, Stone and Blackwell spoke on taxation without representation before two large meetings in Orange, and circulated petitions asking the New Jersey legislature for woman suffrage. Stone’s protest inspired other tax-paying women to action: some followed her example and refused to pay taxes, with one case reaching the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1863, while others went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> to demand their right as tax-payers to vote.|$|E

5|$|The Brazilian {{constitution}} of 1988 {{called for a}} general vote on {{the restoration of the}} monarchy, which was held in 1993. The royalists went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> divided, with the press indicating there were actually two princes aspiring to the Brazilian throne (Dom Luiz de Orleans e Bragança and Dom João Henrique); this created some confusion among the voters. Voting tickets further divided the electorate by placing one box for a presidential republic on the ballot and four for a monarchy. Additional anti-monarchial sentiment was generated by several aggressive television commercials claiming that a vote for monarchy would be a vote for the return of slavery for blacks and a loss of Brazil's recent return to democracy after decades of military dictatorship. This result was a loss for the monarchists at the polls.|$|E
5|$|After {{a decade}} of {{constant}} warfare, France and Britain signed the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802, bringing the Revolutionary Wars to an end. Amiens called for the withdrawal of British troops from recently conquered colonial territories {{as well as for}} assurances to curtail the expansionary goals of the French Republic. With Europe at peace and the economy recovering, Napoleon's popularity soared to its highest levels under the Consulate, both domestically and abroad. In a new plebiscite during the spring of 1802, the French public came out in huge numbers to approve a constitution that made the Consulate permanent, essentially elevating Napoleon to dictator for life. Whereas the plebiscite two years earlier had brought out 1.5 million people <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls,</b> the new referendum enticed 3.6 million to go and vote (72% of all eligible voters). There was no secret ballot in 1802 and few people wanted to openly defy the regime; the constitution gained approval with over 99% of the vote. His broad powers were spelled out in the new constitution: Article 1. The French people name, and the Senate proclaims Napoleon-Bonaparte First Consul for Life. After 1802, he was generally referred to as Napoleon rather than Bonaparte.|$|E
5|$|Despite Governor Catts' {{change of}} attitude, white mob action {{frequently}} occurred in towns throughout north and central Florida and went unchecked by local law enforcement. Extrajudicial violence against black residents was so common that it seldom {{was covered by}} newspapers. In 1920, whites removed four black men from jail, who were suspects accused of raping a white woman in Macclenny, and lynched them. In Ocoee the same year, two black citizens armed themselves to go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> during an election. A confrontation ensued and two white election officials were shot, after which a white mob destroyed Ocoee's black community, causing as many as 30 deaths, and destroying 25 homes, two churches, and a Masonic Lodge. Just weeks before the Rosewood massacre, the Perry Race Riot occurred on 14 and 15 December 1922, in which whites burned Charles Wright at the stake and attacked the black community of Perry, Florida after a white schoolteacher was murdered. On the day following Wright's lynching, whites shot and hanged two more black men in Perry; next they burned the town's black school, Masonic lodge, church, amusement hall, and several families' homes.|$|E

The STA should respond <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> frame by transmitting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> AP its data frame on which the ACK frame corresponding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> data frame transmitted by the AP can be piggybacked.
