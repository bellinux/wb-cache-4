30|$|Organosolv lignin can be {{used for}} PF resin. Ethanol lignin, which is {{obtained}} from ethanol–water pulping, can be applied in the production of adhesives. Ayla reported that a resin composed of 90  % ethanol lignin (isolated from beech or pine wood) and 10  % phenol led to boiling proof bond according to the German Standards [86]. Formacell and Acetocolv lignins from Eucalyptus {{can be used}} in PF resins [19, 87, 88]. Sano and Ichikawa prepared PF resins containing cresol lignin, which was obtained from solvolytic pulping of hardwood chips with aqueous cresols. They showed that at least 90  % of the phenol resins could be replaced by the cresol lignin [89]. During solvolysis using a cresol-water system, a significant amount of cresol (10 – 30  % cresol) was introduced onto lignin, resulting in an improved reactivity towards formaldehyde. This system showed comparable performance to commercial PF resins, however, cresol lignin could not be commercially available. Upon addition of resorcinol to cresol lignin-phenol resins, moderate-temperature <b>setting</b> <b>adhesives</b> (room <b>temperature</b> <b>setting</b> followed by hot press) could be prepared. Sano et al. [90] also reported moderate-temperature <b>setting</b> lignin-based <b>adhesives</b> based on resorcinol and cresol lignin.|$|R

Three-ply experimental LVL from OPT veneers were bonded using two adhesive spread levels, 250 and 500 g m - 2 for single glue line. Laminated veneer lumber from rubberwood was used as control. The dimensional stability properties investigated include dimensional changes associated with changes in relative humidity of 30 to 90 %, hysteresis over a range of 30 to 90 % and durability against biological attack through soil burial. Amongst the three adhesives, OPT LVL manufactured with EPI (VAc) had the highest Fibre Saturation Point (FSP) and the least was experienced by OPT LVL bonded with PVAc. Totally, the magnitude of hysteresis was below 1. 00 which in the average 0. 69 to 0. 82 for OPT LVL panels while rubberwood LVL, 0. 81 to 0. 94, respectively. Overall, the dimensional stability properties of LVL from OPT bonded with cold <b>setting</b> <b>adhesives</b> namely EPI (SBR), EPI (VAc) and PVAc were found to be comparable with rubberwood...|$|R

40|$|A {{building}} management system (BMS) established to control the system of building services would not incorporate records of occupants' views nor integrate real-time occupants' response for any system fine tuning to satisfy individual demands in a dynamic manner. This study proposes a humanized adaptive baseline information technology (HABIT) algorithm to enable such fine tuning according to the occupants' feedback to optimize {{the acceptance of the}} indoor environment. Apart from solving the complaints from occupants, the proposed algorithm also integrates the collective real-time feedback from endusers with a balance of the imposed design conditions to determine the optimum operation condition of the system. In the study, the <b>temperature</b> <b>set</b> point of an air-conditioning system in certain Hong Kong offices was used as an illustrative example to demonstrate the operation of the algorithm. Survey results on occupants' views and indoor environmental conditions of the offices were used to determine the input parameters of the algorithm.

Practical application: This study provides a new notion of humanized adaptive baseline information technology (HABIT) for air-conditioned spaces of a single <b>temperature</b> <b>set</b> point.

Conventionally, a <b>temperature</b> <b>set</b> is chosen {{in such a way that}} the acceptance rates for replica swaps between adjacent temperatures are independent of the temperature and large enough to ensure frequent swaps. In this paper, we show that by choosing the temperatures with a modified version of the optimized ensemble feedback method we can minimize the round-trip times between the lowest and highest temperatures which effectively increases {{the efficiency of}} the parallel tempering algorithm. In particular, the density of temperatures in the optimized <b>temperature</b> <b>set</b> increases at the 'bottlenecks' of the simulation, such as phase transitions. In turn, the acceptance rates are now temperature dependent in the optimized temperature ensemble.
