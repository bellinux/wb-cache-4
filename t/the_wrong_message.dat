Desperate to save Cody, Cindy warns everyone by entering a message into the news anchor's teleprompter.

Cindy visits the lighthouse, where she encounters The Architect. The loquacious (and lecherous) old man explains Tabitha was his evil adopted daughter, whom his wife drowned in the farm's well, but not before she imprinted her evil onto the tape. Unfortunately, he mistakenly returned it to Blockbuster, unleashing the curse. When Cindy asks about how this relates to the Aliens, the Architect speculates that Tabitha is summoning them to aid her in destroying the human race.|$|E
40|$|Because commemorations of {{historic}} events say {{as much about}} the present as the past, it is important to think carefully about how and why we should remember the Great War in the centenary year of its outbreak. Commemoration must not be allowed to degenerate into mere mass entertainment, thoughtless celebration of martial valour, an occasion for chauvinism, or an advertisement for the merits of war as a means of settling international disputes. More respectable reasons for commemorating the Great War are that it provides opportunities (i) to learn from past mistakes, (ii) to reaffirm some common core values, and (iii) to pay our respects to those who died in their country’s service. I argue, however, that each of these justifications raises serious problems of interpretation and application, and that careful thought and moral sensitivity is needed if our efforts at commemoration are not to send out <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>messages...</b>|$|R
40|$|Advertising must {{compete for}} the {{attention}} of prospective consumers, and attention is a scarce resource. "Junk " mail, "spam " e-mail, telemar-keting ’phone calls, and advertising messages generally have the common feature that both sides of the market (advertisers and prospective cus-tomers) need to apply effort to generate a transaction. Message recipients supply attention according to expected consumer surplus, which depends on the average benefits across messages received. Senders are motivated by expected profits. The equilibrium number of messages transmitted de-pends on the profit of the marginal firm along with the communication probability induced from the receiver attention decision. In equilibrium, <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>messages</b> may be sent, or too many may be sent. A higher cost of message transmission may improve message quality and raise the number of messages examined and the optimal message rate reflects this. Endogenizing the number of messages per sender causes another "lot-tery ticket " dimension for profit dissipation. Product class competition also dissipates rents. An opt-out option (e. g. the Federal Do-Not-Call list) is better than an outright ban, but too many individuals opt out...|$|R
40|$|Although {{some analysts}} blamed {{the welfare system}} for making single {{parenting}} financially viable, most research showed that welfare played at most a small role in out-of-wedlock births. Nonetheless, a consensus emerged that {{even if it was}} not the primary cause of nonmarital childbearing, the welfare system sent <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>messages</b> about work and single-parenting, and therefore required fundamental restructuring. In response, states experimented with increasingly significant changes to their welfare programs. The “waiver reforms ” of the early to mid- 1990 s (so called because they required exemptions from federal Aid to Families with Dependent Children, or AFDC, rules) emphasized moving welfare recipients into employment through work requirements, time limits, and other financial incentives. Although a number of states broadened welfare eligibility for two-parent families and capped cash grants when recipients had additional children, family formation was not a major focus of the waiver reforms. The tide appeared to shift in 1996, when the landmark Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) made reducing out-of-wedlock childbearing and encouraging marriage, along with promoting work, central objectives of the new federal welfar...|$|R

He also argued that representative democracy necessarily excluded plebiscites, because then it would open the door to plebiscites on a variety of serious and controversial issues.|$|E

2500|$|The {{amount and}} quality of sleep {{experienced}} in space is poor due to highly variable light and dark cycles on flight decks and poor illumination during daytime hours in the space craft. Even the habit of looking {{out of the window}} before retiring can send <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>messages</b> to <b>the</b> brain, resulting in poor sleep patterns. These disturbances in circadian rhythm have profound effects on the neurobehavioural responses of crew and aggravate the psychological stresses they already experience (see Fatigue and sleep loss during spaceflight for more information). Sleep is disturbed on the ISS regularly due to mission demands, such as the scheduling of incoming or departing space vehicles. Sound levels in the station are unavoidably high because the atmosphere is unable to thermosiphon; fans are required at all times to allow processing of the atmosphere, which would stagnate in the freefall (zero-g) environment. Fifty percent of space shuttle astronauts take sleeping pills and still get 2 hours less sleep each night in space than they do on the ground. NASA is researching two areas which may provide the keys to a better night’s sleep, as improved sleep decreases fatigue and increases daytime productivity. [...] A variety of methods for combating this phenomenon are constantly under discussion.|$|R

25|$|James Edward Taylor Calnan {{was born}} on November 24, 1967, in Picton, Ontario. He has Bachelor of Arts (1991) and Master of Arts (1993) degrees from the University of Waterloo and a Ph.D. from the University of Guelph (1999), all in History. He has taught at the University of Guelph and Laurier Brantford. Calnan was {{appointed}} to the Brantford Heritage Committee in 2001; he later chaired the committee and took part in efforts to preserve historical buildings. He also became active with an environment citizens' advisory group in 2002, after reports of groundwater contamination in his neighbourhood. Calnan first ran for Brantford city council in the 2003 municipal election. He finished third in the city's fourth ward. He was appointed to council in February 2006, after incumbent Dave Wrobel resigned for health reasons. (There is a tradition in Brantford of appointing the runner-up candidate to fill a vacancy on council. Some right-wing members of council unsuccessfully tried to appoint Alayne Sokoloski instead of Calnan.) Calnan was one of three councillors to vote against a grocery superstore and big-box outlet at Wayne Gretzky Parkway and Henry Street in April 2006. He was re-elected to a full term on council in the 2006 election and was the only councillor not to support a censure motion against the government of Ontario's Green Energy Act 2009, which shifted some powers away from municipalities. Calnan said that the censure motion sent <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>message</b> on environmental issues. In the 2010 mayoral race, he proposed an ambassador program to promote Brantford in other areas.|$|E

40|$|Text Messaging Encryption {{system is}} a text message {{encryption}} and decryption. Encryption {{is a process of}} masking a message so that it is unreadable. Encryption is important to avoid other people to read certain information. The only way to read the information is to know the method on how message is being masked,in this case knowing the algorithm used to encrypt the message. Nowadays,most encryption and decryption processes are done by the computer. The main objective of this project is to build a text encryption and decryption system that will run on a Java enabled mobile phones. Then,the mobile phones will be used as an external means to encrypt text messages. As mentioned earlier,not only computers can encrypt and decrypt text but mobile phones also can encrypt and decrypt text messages. The purpose of this research is to provide security for confidential information to be sent over mobile phones. At the moment there is no security for messages transmitted over mobile phones. Confidential information or instructions can only be safely passed on to the required parties by email or verbally in person. This delays time and efficiency of crucial business operations.
