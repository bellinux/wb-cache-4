25|$|Light debris {{outside of}} Iapetus's orbit, either knocked {{free from the}} surface of a moon by micrometeoroid impacts or created in a collision, would spiral in as its orbit decays.

In support of the hypothesis, simple numerical models of the exogenic deposition and thermal water redistribution processes can closely predict the two-toned appearance of Iapetus. A subtle color dichotomy between Iapetus's leading and trailing hemispheres, with the former being more reddish, can in fact be observed in comparisons between both bright and dark areas of the two hemispheres. In contrast to the elliptical shape of Cassini Regio, the color contrast closely follows the hemisphere boundaries; the gradation between the differently colored regions is gradual, on a scale of hundreds of km. The next moon inward from Iapetus, chaotically rotating Hyperion, also has an unusual reddish color.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic thermal-mechanical model {{to investigate the}} thermal characteristics in a spindle-bearing system. In this model, transient thermal analysis, static structure analysis and calculation of the boundary conditions are conducted as a solution loop. The transient boundary conditions, such as bearing stiffness, bearing heat generation and thermal contact conductance, are calculated with the appropriate formulas and solution methodology. The <b>thermal</b> <b>feedbacks,</b> which are seldom considered in the previous studies, are calculated in details. In order to validate the prediction accuracy, thermal equilibrium experiment is conducted on a test rig of spindle-bearing system. The predictions of the proposed model, such as bearing preload, temperature and thermal displacements, are {{in close agreement with}} the experiment results. The comparisons of the proposed model with two traditional simulations show that, the <b>thermal</b> <b>feedbacks</b> on the boundary conditions and thermal contact conductance are of great importance to the real-time estimation of the thermal characteristics.

Being {{the first time that}} a reduced order model is developed in this context, the work focused on a methodological approach and the coupling between the neutronics and the heat transfer, where the <b>thermal</b> <b>feedbacks</b> on neutronics are explicitly taken into account, in time-invariant settings. In order to address the potential of such approach, two different kinds of varying parameters have been considered, namely one related to a geometric quantity (i. e., the inner radius of the fuel pellet) and one related to a physical quantity (i. e., the inlet lead velocity). The capabilities of the presented reduced order model (ROM) have been tested and compared with a high-fidelity finite element model (upon which the ROM has been constructed) on different aspects. In particular, the comparison focused on the system reactivity prediction (with and without <b>thermal</b> <b>feedbacks</b> on neutronics), the neutron flux and temperature field reconstruction, and on the computational time. The outcomes provided by the reduced order model are in good agreement with the high-fidelity finite element ones, and a computational speed-up of at least three orders of magnitude is achieved as well. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} the ongoing developments of a haptic (in fact multi-modal) framework called I-TOUCH, which serve two purposes. The first purpose is academic and concerns {{the conception of}} a generic framework that is able to allow researchers in haptics to prototype quickly computer haptic algorithms and to do quantitative and qualitative evaluations of their concepts. Nevertheless, the foundations of I-TOUCH are radically different from existing commercially available haptics libraries. Indeed, no haptic graph-scene is defined and haptics is directly derived from the dynamic simulation engine. We are providing a discussion on {{the pros and cons}} related to this choice. The second purpose is applicative and concerns a priori virtual prototyping with haptic feedback in industry (automotive or aerospace). Secondary we show that I-TOUCH flexibility allows creating new application with haptic feedback in a simple manner. Moreover, I-TOUCH is haptic device independent and this will be demonstrated by connecting simply various active haptic devices and passive ones. I-TOUCH is also made flexible to imply other modalities rendering devices, such as, obviously vision, but also 3 D sound and tactile including <b>thermal</b> <b>feedbacks.</b> This extension is made for the purpose of psychophysics research investigations.

40|$|In the paper, the {{development}} of a multiphysics model for the transient analysis of non-moderated Molten Salt Reactors is discussed. Particular attention is devoted to the description of the adopted time integration and physics coupling strategies. The proposed model features the adoption of an implicit Runge–Kutta scheme and the coupling among neutron diffusion, Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations for mass and momentum conservation, and energy and delayed neutron precursor balance equations, in order to accurately catch <b>thermal</b> <b>feedbacks</b> on neutronics. The solver is aimed at performing fast-running simulations of the full-core three-dimensional Molten Salt Fast Reactor geometry. The neutronics modelling is assessed against Monte Carlo simulations and the results of a simplified case study are compared to those from multiphysics tools previously developed. As an example of the capability of the model, an un protected MSFR single pump failure accidental scenario is simulated and discussed. The main purpose of the present model is to serve as fast-running computational tool in the phase of design optimization of fuel loop components. More in general, it is of valuable help in the study of reactor physics of circulating-fuel systems...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{models of}} the {{extended}} atmospheres of long period variable or Mira stars have shown that their winds have a very simple, power law structure when averaged over the pulsation cycle. This structure is stable and robust despite the pulsational wave disturbances, {{and appears to be}} strongly self-regulated. Observational studies support these conclusions. The models also show that dust-free winds are nearly adiabatic, with little heating or cooling. The classical, steady, adiabatic wind solution to the hydrodynamic equations fails to account for an extensive region of nearly constant outflow velocity. We investigate analytic solutions which include the effects of wave pressure, heating, and the resulting entropy changes. Wave pressure is represented by a term like that in the Reynolds turbulence equation for the mean velocity. Although the pressure from individual waves is modest, the waves are likely the primary agent of self-regulation of dust-free winds. In models of dusty winds, the gas variables also adopt a power law dependence on radius. Heating is required at all radii to maintain this flow, and grain heating and heat transfer to the gas are significant.

40|$|We use an {{ice sheet}} model (GLIMMER) with an erosion {{component}} {{to examine the}} evolution of landscapes under ice sheets over long time scales in hypothetical situations. GLIMMER is a fully coupled thermomechanical 3 -dimensional ice sheet model with a sliding component. The model thus {{has the ability to}} predict ice thickness, the distribution of areas at pressure melting point and basal velocities. The erosion rate is assumed to be a simple linear function of the basal velocity and therefore erosion only occurs where the bed is not frozen and basal sliding is possible. In addition, sliding velocities are assumed to be related to basal water production, thus giving a mechanism for smooth temporal and spatial transitions between eroding and non-eroding portions of the bed. The eroding glacial landscape system is modelled for long-term persistent glaciation assuming a variety of initial landscapes. Results indicate that without the inclusion of basal water production in the calculation of sliding velocities, any <b>thermal</b> <b>feedbacks</b> are exaggerated because of steep horizontal basal temperature gradients. Additionally, bed morphology exerts a greater influence under low basal slip conditions because ice cannot respond readily to thermal instabilities. We suggest that erosion and valley overdeepening may aid stabilisation of the thermal regime of an ice sheet and {{that it is possible to}} generate glacial signals in previously fluvial systems after only 100 kyr of glaciation at conservative erosion rates. ...|$|R

50|$|Clusters {{of galaxies}} {{are the most}} recent and most massive objects to have arisen in the {{hierarchical}} structure formation of the Universe {{and the study of}} clusters tells one about the way galaxies form and evolve. Clusters have two important properties: their masses are large enough to retain any energetic gas ejected from member galaxies and the thermal energy of the gas within the cluster is observable within the X-Ray bandpass. The observed state of gas within a cluster is determined by a combination of shock heating during accretion, radiative cooling, and <b>thermal</b> <b>feedback</b> triggered by that cooling. The density, temperature, and substructure of the intracluster X-Ray gas therefore represents the entire thermal history of cluster formation.

40|$|Jakobshavn Isbrae {{is a major}} marine {{terminating}} outlet glacier of {{the western}} Greenland Ice Sheet, which has been undergoing widespread acceleration and strong mass loss since the disintegration of its floating ice tongue in the late 1990 s. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood despite a wealth in observational and modelling studies. This doctoral thesis analyses the dynamic changes of Jakobshavn Isbrae using the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM), a state-of-the-art finite-element ice flow model. Two missing model features for 1) the modelling the polythermal regime of glaciers and ice sheets, and 2) the dynamic evolution of its horizontal calving front position are designed and implemented into ISSM. A three-dimensional, thermodynamically coupled model of Jakobshavn Isbrae is set up and calibrated using modern observational data products. Low basal drag in the trough under the ice stream requires that its high driving stress is balanced by lateral drag in the shear margins, which allows for high flow velocities, as the ice viscosity is strain-rate-dependent. The developed modules are applied to the glacier model, which captures 90 % of the observed changes from 1985 to 2015. Analysis of the model results reveals that calving front retreat is able to trigger widespread inland acceleration due to a rheological ice viscosity drop in the shear margins. <b>Thermal</b> <b>feedbacks</b> contribute 5 to 10 % to the total acceleration. The study shows that Jakobshavn Isbrae will continue to contribute to eustatic sea level rise {{for at least the}} next century due to ongoing geometry adjustment to the new calving front position.

While earlier research on <b>feedback</b> <b>thermal</b> control has shown promise {{in dealing with}} the uncertainty in thermal characteristics, multicore processors introduce new challenges that cannot be handled by previous solutions designed for single-core processors. Multicore processors require the temperature and real-time performance of multiple cores be controlled simultaneously, leading to multi-input-multi-output control problems with inter-core thermal coupling. Furthermore, current Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) mechanisms only support a finite set of states, leading to discrete control variables that cannot be handled by standard linear control techniques.

Only in the most massive halos, BHs can grow to masses up to ~ 10 ^ 9 Msun by z ~ 6 without invoking super-Eddington accretion.

Our modelling suggests that current flux-limited surveys of QSOs at high redshift preferentially detect objects at their peak luminosity and therefore miss a substantial population of QSOs powered by similarly massive BHs but with low accretion rates. To test whether the required host halo masses are consistent with the observed galaxy environment of z ~ 6 QSOs, we produce realistic rest-frame UV images of our simulated galaxies. Without strong stellar feedback, our simulations predict numbers of bright galaxies larger than observed by a factor ten or more. Supernova-driven galactic winds reduce the predicted numbers to a level consistent with observations indicating that stellar feedback was already very efficient at high redshifts.
