5|$|Anna has {{distinguishable}} {{facial features}} of a typical Disney heroine, including big eyes, thin lips and a small nose. Her physical appearance has drawn much comparison between her and Rapunzel from Tangled, however there are considerable differences between them. Anna's eyes are slightly more upturned, her cheeks are a bit fuller, her face and chin are generally rounder, and her eyebrows and eyelashes are thicker than Rapunzel's. She also has more freckles than Rapunzel and even has them on her shoulders. Anna's eyebrows wrinkle when they move, and she has prevalent neck muscles that appear when she speaks. Anna's travel outfit generally consists of magenta, black, dark and light blue, with flowery designs on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress.|$|E

She then steamed to the New York Navy Yard {{and went into the}} drydock to have <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hull painted. The ship returned to the Norfolk Navy Yard for periodic maintenance from 3 November 1906 to 18 February 1907. A fire control device was installed between 19 February and 23 March. Virginia then returned to Cuba, arriving in Guantanamo Bay on 28 March. She conducted gunnery training off Cuba until 10 April, when she departed for Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she remained from 15 April to 15 May.

Target practice followed off Cape Cod Bay from mid-June to mid-July. Virginia and the rest of her division then cruised the east coast, stopping in Newport, New York City, and Provincetown, followed by night battle training in Cape Cod Bay.|$|E
25|$|The {{weight of}} Taihos armor {{immersed}} her hull so deeply that her lower hangar deck was barely above the load waterline and <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> two elevator wells (which formed the roofs <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{fore and aft}} aviation fuel tanks) were actually below the waterline. This latter fact would {{play an important role}} in her subsequent destruction during the Battle of the Philippine Sea.|$|R

5|$|In 1953, editor Hugh Hefner began {{publishing}} Playboy and {{the magazine}} became popular {{because of its}} early Playmates, such as Mansfield, Marilyn Monroe, Bettie Page, and Anita Ekberg. Mansfield posed nude for the February 1955 issue of Playboy, modeling in pajamas raised so that <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> breasts showed. This increased the magazine's circulation and helped launch Mansfield's career. Beginning in February 1955, she formed a long-standing relationship with Playboy. Shortly afterward, she posed for the Playboy calendar, covering her breasts with her hands. Playboy featured Mansfield every February from 1955 to 1958, and again in 1960.|$|R

500|$|Mighty Jill Off {{incorporates}} several BDSM themes. It stars a submissive lesbian named Jill {{who has a}} boot fetish. She is kicked to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> Queen's tower {{for acting}} like a [...] "greedy slut". Jill attempts to climb back up the tower and return to her Queen; once there, she is given affection, constricted and gagged, and made to do it again.|$|E

500|$|There {{are three}} {{witnesses}} who provide direct evidence supporting {{the idea that}} Park was innocent. The first, a neighbour, claims that they saw Carol at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> driveway. A second, another neighbour, claims that they saw an unidentified man in a Volkswagen Beetle in the Parks' drive for twenty minutes. The presence of the unidentified car has never been accounted for. Around 6pm that night, another witness, a woman who knew Carol, saw her at Charnock Richard services. She had mentioned to her husband the fact that Carol had not greeted her, describing her as [...] "snobby".|$|E
500|$|Most {{critics were}} not {{impressed}} with the medley, comparing it to Aguilera's identity during the Bionic era. Tamar Anitai, also of MTV Buzzworthy summarized the performance saying it [...] "was all about her [...] "I-I'm-still-a-diva" [...] vocals, frenzied stage show, and adult-only innuendo...And then this happened." [...] She went on to comment also sarcastically, [...] "This is so just Christina Aguilera's way of saying she loves you! And that the diminutive diva still {{has a sense of}} humor....It's like a little knowing wink that assures you that when she's not changing diapers and doing mommy stuff, Mamaguilera's hanging out at dance party sex dungeons and wailing from <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> light-up hoo-ha. She is DEFINITELY not the same girl who once bopped around on the Disney Channel in a Scrunchie." ...|$|E
500|$|At 14:05, Yahagi sank, {{the victim}} of twelve bombs and seven torpedoes. At the same time, a final flight of torpedo bombers {{attacked}} Yamato from her starboard side. Her list was now such that the torpedoes—set {{to a depth of}} —struck <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hull. The battleship continued her inexorable roll to port. By 14:20, the power went out and her remaining 25mm anti-aircraft guns began to drop into the sea. Three minutes later, Yamato capsized. Her main 46cm turrets fell off, and as she rolled suction was created that drew swimming crewmen back toward the ship. When the roll reached approximately °, one of the two bow magazines detonated in a tremendous explosion. The resulting mushroom cloud—over [...] high—was seen [...] away on Kyūshū. Yamato sank rapidly, losing an estimated 3,055 of her 3,332 crew, including fleet commander Vice-Admiral Seiichi Itō. The few survivors that weren't killed by strafing fighters were recovered by the four surviving destroyers, which withdrew to Japan.|$|E

60|$|And so behold our two heroes {{sniffing}} {{round the}} sordid backs and wasted meadows and marshy places of Lumley. They found one barren patch where two caravans were standing. A woman was peeling potatoes, sitting on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> step <b>of</b> <b>her</b> caravan. A half-caste girl {{came up with}} a large pale-blue enamelled jug of water. In the background were two booths covered up with coloured canvas. Hammering was heard inside.|$|R
500|$|The show {{included}} many references such as to James Brown and Donna Summer {{as well as}} routines inspired by Sweet Charity and Marilyn Monroe. It opened in darkness, with Knowles emerging {{through a hole in}} the stage amidst smoke, sparkles and pyrotechnics to perform [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] with a snippet of Gnarls Barkley's [...] "Crazy" [...] in a sparkling silver gown and walking to the front of the stage, as fifteen disco balls hung from the ceiling. Her background band started playing the music to the funk song and while singing, Knowles walked up a huge staircase which moved forward in two places where her all-female band and three backup singers were positioned. At the top of the staircase/mini-stage, she tore off <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress and walked back down to the main stage.

500|$|Onstage Beyoncé had an all-female band, and {{the show}} used men only as dancers for the female {{audience}} as noted by Pareles of The New York Times.

500|$|Due to Manson's growing {{confidence}} and technical skill, the band decided that her vocals {{did not require}} much treatment; [...] "Shirley was singing so much better, and she was coming up with melodies that were longer and had more range to them...there wasn't any point in doing a lot with it. On something like 'Nobody Loves You' she sings really low on the verse, almost at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> range, and then and the end she's singing {{three and a half}} octaves higher, almost in falsetto, as the song turns into a big wall of sound", Vig remarked. Manson's original guide vocals were used in the final mixes of several songs; the vocal on [...] "So Like a Rose" [...] was recorded on the first take. On some songs, however, Manson's vocal was subject to Pro Tools plug-ins and post effects. [...] "Til the Day Die" [...] featured a digital [...] "scratch"-effect, created by printing her vocal to DAT and using whatever edited passes sounded good. On [...] "Can't Cry These Tears", the four vocal parts were triple-tracked using different mikes, while a guitar riff was matched to her voice for a section of [...] "Breaking Up the Girl". On [...] "Cherry Lips", her entire vocal was sped up and heavily EQ'd. On slower songs such as [...] "Drive You Home", Garbage were not overly concerned with phrasing and pitch, giving it [...] "a rawer quality". Manson improved on her guitar skills and played more guitar in the studio and live on stage for the eventual tour.|$|E

500|$|Despite the problems, {{the tour}} was a success, and Lloyd {{performed}} to packed theatres throughout America. Her act featured the songs [...] "The Tiddly Wink", [...] "I'd Like to Live in Paris All the Time (The Coster Girl in Paris)", and [...] "The Aviator". The numbers were popular, {{partly due to}} the Americanisation of each song's lyrics. On a personal level, Lloyd's time in America was miserable and was made worse by the increasing domestic abuse she received from Dillon. [...] The assaults caused her to miss several key performances, which angered the theatre manager, Edward Albee, who threatened her with a breach of contract action. [...] She claimed that illness made it difficult for her to perform and protested at her billing position. The theatrical press were not convinced. The New York Telegraph speculated [...] "In vaudeville circles her domestic relations are thought to be at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> attacks of disposition." [...] Back in England, Hurley had died of pleurisy and pneumonia on 6 December 1913. Lloyd heard the news while appearing in Chicago and sent a wreath with a note saying [...] "until we meet again". [...] She was reported in The Morning Telegraph as saying: [...] "With all due respect to the dead, I can cheerfully say that's the best piece of news I've heard in many years, for it means that Bernard Dillon and I will marry as soon as this unlucky year ends." [...] Lloyd married Dillon on 21 February 1914, [...] the ceremony taking place at the British Consulate in Portland, Oregon. When the tour finished, Lloyd commented, [...] " [...] never forget the humiliation to which I have been subjected and I shall never sing in America again, no matter how high the salary offered." ...|$|E
500|$|After a {{break of}} almost four months, Beholder {{returned}} in the Torrey Pines Stakes over one mile at Del Mar on September 1, {{where she was}} ridden {{for the first time}} by Gary Stevens. She started the 1–10 favorite and led all the way, winning from second-place finisher Wittgenstein. Four weeks later, Beholder was matched against older fillies and mares in the Grade I Zenyatta Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Santa Anita. She led from the start and won, with the six-year-old veteran Authenticity in second. Mandella called the winner [...] "a filly that really likes the fight" [...] while Stevens said that [...] "I haven't gotten close to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> yet". On November 1, Beholder contested the Breeders' Cup Distaff over nine furlongs at Santa Anita. The field was a very strong one, including Royal Delta who had won the race for the last two years, Princess of Sylmar, Authenticity, and Close Hatches. Although Beholder showed some anxiety in the starting gate, she had a clean start. Mandella had been training her so that instead of always being a front-runner, she could be [...] rated behind other horses and conserve energy. His strategy was a success as Beholder tracked the leaders before moving up into second place half a mile from the finish. She took the lead two furlongs out and went clear of the field to win by [...] lengths over Close Hatches, with Royal Delta fourth and Princess of Sylmar last of the six runners. After the race, Mandella said, [...] "I’ve been lucky enough to have many good mares in my years of training, but this mare might have to be the best of all." [...] With her Distaff win, she became the first horse to win both the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and the Distaff in consecutive years.|$|E
