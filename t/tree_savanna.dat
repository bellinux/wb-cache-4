50|$|With {{the above}} topographic, climatic and soil settings, the {{vegetation}} types which cover the park are categorized under five broad types of open combretaceous shrub savanna, anogeissus leiocarpus woodland, lannea humilis open grass savanna, acacia seyal <b>tree</b> <b>savanna</b> and Yaéré floodplains with perennial grasses. In the desert conditions, with no perennial streams {{flowing through the}} park area, there are no perennial grasses in the park. The water holes are created for animals. The combretaceous shrub savanna consist of Sclerocarya birrea <b>tree</b> <b>savanna,</b> Combretum and Terminalia shrubs and the doum palm Hyphaene thebaica. The Anogeissus leiocarpus woodland is in sandy soils with Mitragyna inermis in pockets near temporary water bodies. Lannea humilis are open grass savanna combined with short annual grasses. Patches of trees and stands of Mitragyna inermis are also reported from small islands near temporary water bodies. In this condition, vegetation reported are in the formations of compact clay. However, the area is very saline due to high evaporation. The fourth category of vegetation comprises Acacia seyal <b>tree</b> <b>savanna</b> growing in black clay soils which gets highly saturated during the rainy months; grasses in these conditions spread very slowly or may even dry up. The last type of vegetation is reported in the Yaéré flood plains, an important area to maintain perennial grasses in the park. The grasses reported are: Vetiveria nigritana, Oryza barthii, Echinochloa pyramidalis and Echinochloa stagnina and a few herbaceous legumes with Sesbania pachycarpa. However, in these conditions, {{where there are no}} trees, forest fires are common. A particular feature in the central and western parts of the park was that substantial areas were of annual grasses and herbs, interspersed by Acacia seyal shrublands. They were subject to seasonal flooding before the construction of the Maga dam.|$|E

40|$|The {{extent of}} water uptake by lateral roots of <b>savanna</b> <b>trees</b> in the Brazilian {{highlands}} {{was measured by}} irrigating two 2 by 2 m plots with deuterium-enriched water and assaying for the abundance of deuterium in stem water from trees inside and at several distances from the irrigation plots. Stem water of trees inside the irrigation plots was highly enriched {{compared to that of}} control trees, whereas stem water of trees just outside the plot was only slightly enriched compared with that from control trees. Therefore, bulk water uptake in the <b>savanna</b> <b>trees</b> studied occurred in a horizontally restricted area, indicating that their rooting structure was characterized by a dense cluster of short roots associated with the main trunk and a few meandering long range lateral roots. This root architecture was confirmed by extensive excavations of several species. The same deuterium labeling pattern was observed in an Amazonian tropical forest. The savanna ecosystem, however, differed from the tropical forest ecosystem by having a greater proportion of trees outside the irrigation plots having stem water with deuterium levels significantly above background. This leads us to the conclusion that <b>savanna</b> <b>trees</b> have more or longer lateral roots compared to tropical forest trees.

40|$|Abstract The {{spatial pattern}} of dry {{rainforest}} and <b>savanna</b> <b>tree</b> species was analysed in a 1. 56 -ha plot within an unburnt eucalypt savanna woodland in north Queensland, Australia. Rainforest colonization constituted only 1. 3 % of the basal area and mostly consisted of individuals less than 3 m high. The distribution of rainforest trees was highly clumped around the large <b>savanna</b> eucalypt <b>trees.</b> Ecological mechanisms generating the clumped distribution {{are discussed in}} light of evidence from this study and the literature. Herbaceous biomass was not reduced under trees, suggesting that relief from grass competition has not favoured rainforest colonization under tree crowns. Edaphic facilitation through nutrient enrichment under <b>savanna</b> <b>tree</b> crowns appears to be only minor on the moderate fertility soils of the area. The highly clumped pattern of colonizing dry rainforest may be a consequence of seeds dropped from birds roosting in <b>savanna</b> <b>trees...</b>|$|R
