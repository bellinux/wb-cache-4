5|$|The article follows Gibson's {{observations}} of the architecture, phenomenology and culture of Singapore, and the clean, bland and conformist impression the city-state conveys during his stay. Its title and central metaphor—Singapore as Disneyland with the death penalty—is {{a reference to the}} authoritarian artifice the author perceives the city-state to be. Singapore, Gibson details, is lacking any sense of creativity or authenticity, absent of any indication of its history or underground culture. He finds the government to be pervasive, corporatist and technocratic, and the judicial system rigid and draconian. Singaporeans are characterized as consumerists of insipid taste. <b>The</b> <b>article</b> <b>is</b> accentuated by local news reports of criminal trials by which the author illustrates his observations, and bracketed by contrasting descriptions of the Southeast Asian airports he arrives and leaves by.|$|E

25|$|Article 153 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{controversial}} articles in the Malaysian constitution. Critics consider it to create an unnecessary and racialist distinction between Malaysians of different ethnic backgrounds, because it has led to the implementation of affirmative action policies which benefit only the Bumiputra, who comprise a majority of the population. Technically, discussing the repeal of Article 153 is illegal—even in Parliament, although it was drafted as a temporary provision to the Constitution. Despite this prohibition on discussion, <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>is</b> heatedly debated both privately and publicly among Malaysians, against the implementation of the article although ostensibly maintaining support for it.

In the second stage, the peer-review process is completed and, if <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>is</b> formally accepted by the editors, the final revised papers are published in ACP.
