5|$|Early {{encryption}} {{techniques such}} as the Hill cipher also used matrices. However, due to the linear nature of matrices, these codes are comparatively easy to break. Computer graphics uses matrices both to represent objects and to calculate transformations of objects using affine rotation matrices to accomplish <b>tasks</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> projecting a three-dimensional object onto a two-dimensional screen, corresponding to a theoretical camera observation. Matrices over a polynomial ring are important {{in the study of}} control theory.|$|E

5|$|In {{a pair of}} studies, high-functioning {{children}} with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language <b>tasks</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals {{are more likely to}} overestimate what their audience comprehends.|$|E
5|$|Throughout history, {{mothers have}} been portrayed {{as the primary}} {{physical}} caregivers of children. Physical caregiving includes <b>tasks</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> breast-feeding and changing diapers.

Fathers, on the other hand, have been more likely to be portrayed in play activities with their children and are often more likely to be shown interacting with sons than daughters.|$|E
5|$|A sailor's {{work was}} {{hard in the}} days of sail. When off duty, many sailors played musical {{instruments}} or joined in unison to sing folksongs such as the mid-eighteenth century ballad The Mermaid, a song which expressed the sailors' superstition that seeing a mermaid foretold a shipwreck. When on duty, there were many repetitive <b>tasks,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> turning the capstan to raise the anchor and heaving on ropes to raise and lower the sails. To synchronise the crew's efforts, sea shanties were sung, with a lead singer performing the verse and the sailors joining in the chorus. In the Royal Navy in Nelson's time, these work songs were banned, being replaced by the notes of a fife or fiddle, or the recitation of numbers.|$|E

PARETO iS a plan execution system based on the as-needed expansion of a hierarchy of sketchy plans. It has been adapted for use in several different domains. There are sev-eral problems that would arise in adapting PARETO to assist in a knowledge management <b>task</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> searching for a relevant document in a proprietary intranet.

5|$|At {{the time}} of {{graduation}} all officers are qualified for operational service. However, each employee must undergo 40 hours of yearly training, including firearms practice, to keep their operational certification. Without this, they cannot patrol, use firearms or participate in actions. Forty-four percent of police officers in 2012 lacked such certification. The main {{reason is that the}} police districts see it as a waste of resources to train investigation and administrative staff which do not participate in operative duty, and that a higher quality is achieved through specialization of <b>tasks,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> dedicated investigation personnel.|$|E
5|$|Australia also formed {{small-scale}} raiding and reconnaissance forces, most {{of which}} were grouped together as the Allied Intelligence Bureau. Z Special Unit conducted raids far behind the front line, including a successful raid on Singapore in September 1943. M Special Unit, coastwatchers and smaller AIB units also operated behind Japanese lines to collect intelligence. AIB parties were often used to support Australian Army units and were assigned to inappropriate <b>tasks</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> tactical reconnaissance and liaison. AIB missions in Timor and Dutch New Guinea were also hampered by being placed under the command of unpopular Dutch colonial administrators. The RAAF formed a specially-equipped unit (No.200Flight) in 1945 to support these operations by transporting and supplying AIB parties in areas held by the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Fourteen regular {{national}} {{holidays are}} observed throughout the year, with others occasionally inserted by the government. The week following Genocide Memorial Day on 7 April is designated an official week of mourning. The {{victory for the}} RPF over the Hutu extremists is celebrated as Liberation Day on 4 July. The last Saturday of each month is umuganda, a national morning of mandatory community service lasting from 8am to 11am, during which all able bodied people between 18 and 65 are expected to carry out community <b>tasks</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> cleaning streets or building homes for vulnerable people. Most normal services close down during umuganda, and public transportation is limited.|$|E

He notices one of the vans spying on him outside the house, and decides to pursue it, leading him to Mr. Burns' mansion. Homer concludes that Mr. Burns is responsible, and goes to confront him. However, Burns reveals that the black vans were pizza delivery vans, and proceeds to fire and release his guard dogs on Homer.|$|E
5|$|In November 1944, Company C {{provided}} {{security to}} {{the headquarters of the}} Seventh United States Army. The rest of the First Battalion was assigned other <b>tasks,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> defending the Command Center of the Sixth United States Army Group. The Second and Third Battalions were assigned to defend communications. In 1948, seven members received the Bronze Star for their service in World War II. On 13 December 1944, the 65th Infantry, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Juan César Cordero Dávila, relieved the 2nd Battalion of the 442nd Infantry Regiment, a regiment which was made up of Japanese Americans under the command of Col. Virgil R. Miller, a native of San Germán, Puerto Rico and former member of the 65th Infantry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to copying and restoring portraits, the serjeant-painters also undertook decorative <b>tasks,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> {{the painting of}} banners and stage scenery.

Since Peake’s work is not recorded there, {{it seems as if}} De Critz took responsibility for the more decorative tasks, while Peake continued his work as a royal portrait painter. However, Peake and Paul Isackson painted the cabins, carvings, and armorials on the ship the Prince Royal in 1611.|$|E
