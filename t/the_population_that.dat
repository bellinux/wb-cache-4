5|$|All species {{within the}} wolf-like canids possess 78 {{chromosomes}} {{and therefore can}} potentially interbreed. Genetic analysis reveals that hybridization takes place between gray wolves and jackals, creating a jackal-wolf hybrid. Hybridization also occurs between female golden jackals and male dogs, which produces fertile offspring, a jackal–dog hybrid. There was 11%–13% of ancient gene flow into the golden jackal from <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>that</b> was ancestral to wolves and dogs, and an additional 3% contributed from extant wolf populations. Up to 15% of the Israeli wolf genome is derived from admixure with golden jackals in ancient times.|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{the average}} smoker consumes 12.4 {{cigarettes}} per day, with this figure rising slightly to 15 per day when just male smokers are considered. The average smoker starts smoking at aged 23 {{and the percentage}} of <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>that</b> smokes increases with age until the 55–64 age group, after which it declines. On average urban smokers tend to smoke more cigarettes per day than rural farmers.|$|E

5|$|A 2011 study {{proposed}} the following treatment. The long-tailed birds from the Tibetan Plateau {{with a narrow}} white throat patch are separated as Salim Ali's swift, A. salimali, the small swifts with narrow white rumps from the Himalayas of India, Nepal and Bhutan become Blyth's swift, A. leuconyx, and <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>that</b> breeds in limestone caves in northern Southeast Asia, characterised by a green iridescence and shallow tail fork, is split as Cook's swift, A. cooki. The remaining subspecies are the nominate A. p. pacificus and the southern race A. p. kurodae (which includes the Tibetan population formerly named as kanoi). This arrangement has been accepted by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC), but not the International Union for Conservation of Nature. A 2012 paper showed that cooki {{is closely related to}} the dark-rumped swift, A. acuticauda, which should therefore be included in the pacificus clade, but made no further taxonomic recommendations.|$|E
5|$|After the {{resignation}} of the last Liberal Cabinet, PedroII invited the rival Conservative Party to form a new cabinet. With his party no longer in control, Paranhos lost much of his influence. The Liberal Party was not willing to accept its loss of power. The most radical faction of the Liberals in the province of Pernambuco, known as the Partido da Praia ("Party of the Beach"), openly advocated a rebellion. Nominally Liberal, the praieiros were associated with the Courtier Faction. The proposed rebellion would be an attempt of this branch of the Courtier Faction to regain control of the government. The praieiros had little support, and public opinion was also against them. The group was unable to convince the vast majority of <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>that</b> a revolt would bring them any benefits. On 2 February 1849, the limited uprising of the praieiros was completely defeated after attacking Recife, the capital of Pernambuco. Even though Paranhos had condemned it, the Praiera rebellion, combined with the downfalls of his patron and the Liberal Party, made a continued political career impossible. He turned his focus once again to his work in journalism.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} {{and history of}} Sarawak {{has resulted in a}} broad diversity of ethnicity, culture and languages. Among the indigenous peoples of Sarawak, outside influences have led to many changes over time. The Iban tribal culture in Sarawak centred on the concept of the warrior and the ability to take heads from other tribes in battle. This practice, central as it was to the Iban people, was made illegal under James Brooke's rule and ultimately faded away although reminders of the practice are still seen in some long houses. Two other tribal peoples of the Sarawak Highlands, the Kelabit and Lun Bawang, have seen fundamental changes to their ethnic identities {{as a direct result of}} their conversion to Christianity. One major change was the shift in the focal point of their social interactions from the traditional long house to the local church. Their religious devotion has also helped shape their worldview outside of their village, particularly in response to change. For the Penan people, one of the last tribes to still be practising a nomadic lifestyle within the jungle, outside influence, particularly education, has resulted in a significant decline in <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>that</b> practice the nomadic lifestyle. Others settle down after intermixing with members of different tribes, such as the Orang Ulu. One direct result of this diversity in cultures, engendered by a policy of tolerance to all races, is the increasing numbers of tribal peoples marrying not only other Sarawakian tribes, but also to Chinese, Malays as well as citizens of European or American descent.|$|E
