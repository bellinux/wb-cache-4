5|$|At the Luthor Mansion, Tess Mercer (Cassidy Freeman) {{is confronted}} by Granny Goodness, who offers her one final chance to join Darkseid's forces to spare her life during the coming destruction. Tess refuses, declaring <b>that,</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> {{she was born}} a Luthor, her fate is not sealed. At Watchtower, {{discovering}} that Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley) disabled the organization's satellites, Tess brings up previous satellite footage revealing the planet Apokolips descending toward Earth. Before Tess can warn the team, she is ambushed {{by a group of}} armed men and taken captive. Granny Goodness, Desaad, and Gordon Godfrey meet in their lair. Oliver—possessed by the power of Darkseid—arrives and is instructed to remove Clark's powers with a gold kryptonite wedding ring. At the wedding, Chloe realizes the ring is kryptonite and stops Oliver. Clark helps Oliver overcome Darkseid's control just as Apokolips enters Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Dawkins rounds {{off this}} episode with a {{presentation}} of Bertrand Russell's celestial teapot analogy. He argues <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> science has not yet answered every conceivable question about the universe, {{there is no need}} to turn to faith, which has never answered anything of significance.|$|E
25|$|Some have {{described}} the women’s rights movement in Morocco as a movement of elites and criticized the new Mudawana on similar grounds. Most women’s organizations in Morocco receive external funding, whether from the government, various Moroccan political parties, or international actors such as USAID, the European Development Bank, and the World Bank, which has left them open to criticisms that their agendas {{are tied to the}} sources of their funding and therefore compromised. However, some scholars have argued <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> the movement was started among elites, it does not necessarily follow that they are incongruent with grassroots interests. Still others point out that in an even broader sense, the universal notion of formal equality itself may not be evenly applicable or relevant to women from different social, cultural, and national backgrounds.|$|E

25|$|Some {{critical}} psychiatrists {{criticize the}} practice of defining {{one and the same}} belief as normal in one culture and pathological in another culture for cultural essentialism. They argue that since cultural influences are mixed, including not only parents and teachers but also peers, friends, books and the internet, and the same cultural influence can have different effects depending on earlier cultural influences, the assumption that culture can be boiled down to a few traceable, distinguishable and statistically quantifiable factors and that everything that does not fall in those factors must be biological, is not a justified assumption. Other critical psychiatrists argue <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> a person's belief is unshaken by one influence does not prove that it would remain unshaken by another. For example, a person whose beliefs are not changed by verbal correction from a psychiatrist, which is how delusion is usually diagnosed, may still change his or her mind when observing empirical evidence, only that psychiatry rarely if ever present patients with such situations.|$|E

500|$|On 13 December 2013 Choudary led a {{march in}} Brick Lane, {{organised}} by the east London-based Sharia Project, demanding {{a ban on}} alcohol being sold by Muslim establishments. An East London Mosque official, speaking of the patrols, identified The Shariah Project as [...] "strongly linked" [...] to Anjem Choudary's banned group Al-Muhajiroun. Abu Rumaysah of The Shariah Project had predicted [...] "hundreds" [...] would join the demonstration, claiming that groups of Muslims would come {{from as far away}} as the Midlands to take part. In the event, only a few dozen protesters took part in the march. Choudary afterwards explained its purpose: “What we did is we posted a notice to the shop owners saying that under Sharia and under the Koran the sale of alcohol is prohibited and if one were to also drink alcohol, that would be 40 lashes. We were there to teach them <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> they are living among non-Muslims is no excuse because Sharia law will be implemented in Britain, and so they should be aware <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> it is not Sharia today, they can’t just do whatever they like.” Choudary said that the Shariah Project group would be arranging many more such rallies.|$|E
500|$|So {{this song}} is about me {{basically}} saying <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> {{all of those things}} are there [...] doesn't mean that there is not sort of the same person underneath. And then, also that these veils, they are really just protecting me from the thing that I held the most sacred, which is my creativity ... My Aura is the way that I deal with my insanity and I feel quite insane, so this song sounds very insane ... Everyone thinks that everything I do is a statement but some times I'm just moved by something passionate and I want to express it.|$|E
500|$|Being a {{greatest}} hits album and containing only one new song, recording The Singles 1992–2003 took {{very little time}} compared with the band's studio albums. Production started in September 2003 with the recording of a cover version of Talk Talk's song [...] "It's My Life", produced by Nellee Hooper. The accompanying music video for the song was filmed by director David LaChapelle at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Stefani insisted <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> no songwriting {{was involved in the}} production of the album did not mean no effort would be needed: the band had to decide which of their songs to include and which to leave out. Two months later on November 25, the album was released along with the B-side, rarity, and remix collection Everything in Time and box set Boom Box.|$|E

500|$|The third quatrain {{continues}} {{the metaphor of}} the nightingale and seasonal imagery to further stress that the poet's silence is not because their love is less pleasant. The nightingale is used as a metaphor to explain <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> he doesn't flatter the Fair Youth, doesn't mean that he loves less. As one scholar put it, [...] "too much praise ceases to please". The poet explains his silence further in line 11, that the wild birds physically burden the tree branches as well as crowd the air with their songs. This may represent the myriad of love sonnets being published in attempt to flatter and please their muses. A similar interpretation of line 12 by Katherine Duncan-Jones is given, in which she claims that the poet is addressing the many circulating love sonnets as somewhat redundant, describes them as [...] "pleasures which have become familiar are no longer intensely enjoyable". This is a usage of another common proverb; [...] "Too much familiarity breeds contempt." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Venganza", (Vengeance) speaks {{up against}} the mistreatment of women, which embodies what Queen {{represents}} within her musical compositions. The mid-tempo, [...] "bubble-gum pop" [...] "Papi Te Quiero" [...] (Daddy I Love You), {{named one of the}} album's biggest hits, [...] "pairs a straightforward love song with the well known reggae riddim Buyout." [...] Ramiro Burr of Billboard stated [...] "Papi Te Quiero" [...] showcases how [...] "effortlessly and quickly she alternately sings and raps, claiming that she has a distinct vocal style that evokes Gwen Stefani". Although, the literal translation of [...] "Papi Te Quiero" [...] is [...] "Daddy I Love You", it is not directed towards Queen's father but to her love interest; [...] "Papi" [...] can be translated to [...] "baby". [...] "Quiero Bailar" [...] (I Want To Dance) incorporates the Liquid riddim, a musical riddim produced by the [...] "Jamaican cross-over guru" [...] Jeremy Harding. The song's lyrics [...] "warn her dance partner not to misinterpret her moves." [...] She degrades her partner who thinks <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> she dances with him that she is automatically going to have sexual relations with him.|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{original}} characters graduated from McKinley High {{at the end of}} the third season. Murphy said, [...] "We didn't want to have a show where they were in high school for eight years. We really wanted to be true to that experience." [...] Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch would remain to provide continuity to the series, though according to Falchuk, some students—Rachel, Finn and Kurt in particular—would likely remain on the show after they graduate. In May 2012, Murphy said <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> a character on the show graduates high school does not mean that they are leaving, [...] "A lot of people have been writing Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show — they're not off the show. I think Amber was talking about that bittersweet feeling of, 'I'll never be in the choir room with that exact group of people.' At least that's what she told me ... When I read that [...] I said, 'I think people will misconstrue that.' She's excited about where her character is going. They all are. I wanted to do the right thing by all of them."

500|$|In 1998, BBRC {{explained}} {{its approach}} to the assessment of single-observer records. The committee explained that while it understood that geographical and social circumstances make it likely {{that some people are}} more likely to find rare birds on their own, it is [...] "very cautious about observers with a high proportion of single-observer records" [...] and that its policy is to watch patterns closely and review those observers' past records on a regular basis. This approach has attracted criticism. Former BBRC chairman Ian Wallace and others have written about the subject in Birdwatch magazine. Wallace believes that the committee has a blacklist of observers, from whom it automatically rejects records unless there are other observers able to corroborate the sighting. He mentions two specific observers, both of whom live in remote parts of northern Scotland. Ken Shaw, a former BBRC member, has claimed that BBRC would not accept a single-observer record of a species new to Britain without photographic evidence, regardless of the track record of the observer. Graham Bell, another former member, writing in response to Shaw's article, has accused the committee of adopted unfounded suspicions, arguing <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> a competent observer moves to an underwatched part of the country, their abilities do not change. One of the observers who Wallace claimed was blacklisted, Alan Vittery, also contributed to the debate, stating that he had been informed by the BBRC that they would not consider any single-observer record he submitted, unless supported by a photograph. Vittery contrasted the BBRC's attitude with that of other national rarities committees, arguing that the result of the approach is to distort rarity statistics. Vittery invited the BBRC to reply in public, but this request was declined.|$|E
