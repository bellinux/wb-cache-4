25|$|We {{started off}} with no idea at all. We pretty much threw all <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>in</b> the pot and went on playing. It {{was a case of}} demand driving it. It took off like a rocket. We got more work than we could travel away, but the thing took {{on a life of its}} own. The thing with the Falcons, we never {{actually}} changed our style that much. We just accumulated new ones. It turned into a stratified thing 'cause we were mixing everything together all the way through. There was no plan. – John Power.|$|E

500|$|Heikkinen was the {{one bright}} spot in the Wolverines’ 1937 season. In early November 1937, Anderson {{described}} Heikkinen as “the smallest but best lineman in the Michigan forward wall.” Anderson continued in his praise for Heikkinen: “Heik has shown <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>in</b> both of our tough games against Minnesota and Northwestern [...] [...] [...] Minnesota didn’t split our guards more than twice during the game. Heik was responsible {{for a lot of}} that. My conception of a good guard is one that stops anything that comes his way on defense and leads the blocking on offense. Heik has done just that. When we have the ball he is our fifth man in the backfield. He pulls out most of our plays and bowls over the opposition. We have made most of the gains through the line over his position.” ...|$|E

[...] "After they got rid of us, they brought on Chris Columbus", Murphy stated. [...] "Then I heard they did tests of apes skiing, which didn't make much sense." [...] Stan Winston was still working on the makeup designs. Columbus brought Sam Hamm, his co-writer on an unproduced Fantastic Four script, to write the screenplay. [...] "We tried to do a story that was simultaneously a homage to the elements we liked from the five films, and would also incorporate {{a lot of material}} [...] that had been jettisoned from the earlier production," [...] Hamm continued. [...] "The first half of the script bore little resemblance to the book, but a lot of <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>in</b> the second half comes directly from it, or directly inspired by it." ...|$|E
500|$|U2 hired Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno {{to produce}} the album, based on the duo's prior work with the band on The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree. Lanois was {{principal}} producer, with Mark [...] "Flood" [...] Ellis as engineer. Eno took on an assisting role, working with the group in the studio for {{a week at a}} time to review their songs before leaving for a month or two. Eno said his role was [...] "to come in and erase anything that sounded too much like U2". By distancing himself from the work, he believed he provided the band with a fresh perspective on their material each time he rejoined them. As he explained, [...] "I would deliberately not listen to <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>in</b> between visits, so I could go in cold". Since U2 wanted the record to be harder-hitting and live-sounding, Lanois [...] "push the performance aspect very hard, often to the point of recklessness". The Lanois–Eno team used lateral thinking and a philosophical approach—popularised by Eno's Oblique Strategies—that contrasted with the direct and retro style of Rattle and Hum producer Jimmy Iovine.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Spielberg told {{film critic}} Joe Leydon that [...] "People pretend {{to think they}} know Stanley Kubrick, and think they know me, when most of them don't know either of us". [...] "And what's really funny about that is, all the parts of A.I. that people assume were Stanley's were mine. And all the parts of A.I. that people accuse me of {{sweetening}} and softening and sentimentalizing were all Stanley's. The teddy bear was Stanley's. The whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely Stanley's. The whole first 35, 40 minutes of the film– all <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>in</b> the house– was word for word, from Stanley's screenplay. This was Stanley's vision." [...] "Eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up. But I could see why. Because, obviously, I've {{done a lot of}} movies where people have cried and have been sentimental. And I've been accused of sentimentalizing hard-core material. But in fact it was Stanley who did the sweetest parts of A.I., not me. I'm the guy who did the dark center of the movie, with the Flesh Fair and everything else. That's why he wanted me to make the movie in the first place. He said, 'This is much closer to your sensibilities than my own.|$|E

500|$|Tarwater {{was raised}} in a Christian home, but growing up he [...] "sort of went through the motions" [...] and didn't really hold strong beliefs. By college, he had {{abandoned}} any pretense of faith. [...] He later said that [...] "the Olympics had become an idol in my life." [...] After not making the Olympics in 2008, he met Doug Banister who challenged Tarwater to re-examine his worldview. [...] "The 'A-ha' moments were many," [...] Tarwater later recalled. [...] "y the time I had the ability to prayerfully repent and rebuke <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>in</b> my life, I was finally at a good time in life.... I would say I recommitted my life because I grew up in a Christian home, but really {{it was the first time}} where I knew what I was doing and committed my life to Christ." [...] Tarwater credits his Christian faith for helping him get through the ups and downs of being a competitive swimmer. On his 2012 Olympic experience, he said [...] "It was a real gift from God. [...] I felt His presence so much the past few weeks. [...] It was an unbelievable feeling." [...] Tarwater attends Hope Community Church in Charlotte.|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, AllMusic editor John Bush recommended The Lost Tapes to [...] "hip-hop fans {{who want to}} hear some great rhyming with no added features" [...] and commented that tracks such as [...] "Doo Rags", [...] "No Idea's Original", and [...] "Black Zombie" [...] "stand up to anything Nas has recorded since the original Illmatic." [...] Jesal Padania of RapReviews commented that the album [...] "proved remarkably consistent throughout, and was a superb listening experience" [...] and considered it a studio release, stating [...] "this was a short sharp shock of awesome lyricism, and many, unofficially, consider {{this to be the}} closest cousin we will ever get to Illmatic II." [...] Pitchfork Medias Ryan Dombal cited the album as one of Nas' [...] "finest moments". About.com's Henry Adaso called it [...] "noteworthy because of its superiority to half <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>in</b> Nas' catalog." [...] In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Chris Ryan was less enthusiastic about the album, finding it [...] "somewhat inconsistent, and certainly too scattered to be considered an album per se," [...] even though it features [...] "some classics, such as the nostalgic 'Doo Rags,' that are not to be missed." [...] In its 2007 issue, XXL included The Lost Tapes in its list of [...] "classic" [...] albums to be given the publication's maximum [...] "XXL" [...] rating. In 2012, Complex included The Lost Tapes in their list of [...] "25 Rap Albums From the Past Decade That Deserve Classic Status".|$|E

The cast and crew were on a busy schedule, working 14-hour days and six days a week. In an interview with MTV, Josh Hutcherson confirmed scenes in the film would use IMAX cameras by stating, [...] "They're shooting, I think, all <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>in</b> the arena is going to be IMAX".
