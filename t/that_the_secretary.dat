On arrival in India, he found that the scheme had been abandoned and that as his appointment could be terminated at six-months' notice, he would no longer be required after October 1922. Fairley demanded and received an audience with the Governor of Bombay, Sir George Lloyd, the result of which was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> of State agreed to create a special five-year post of Medical Officer of the Bombay Bacteriological Laboratory and Honorary Consulting Physician to the Sir Jamshedjee Jeejebhoy Hospital and St George Hospital.|$|E
5|$|There is a race {{prejudice}} {{that exists}} between the white and Negro races wherever the Negroes are found in large numbers.... Just this week the announcement comes {{as a shock to}} the people of Oklahoma <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> of the Interior... has appointed a Negro from Kansas to come to Oklahoma and take charge of the supervision of the Indian schools of this State. There is no race of people on earth that has more antipathy for the Negro race than the Indian race, and yet these people, numbering many of the best citizens of this State and nation, are to be humbled and their prejudices and passions are to be increased by having this outrage imposed upon them... If your organization would interest itself to the extent of seeing that such outrages as this are not perpetrated against our people, there would be fewer lynchings in the South than at this time...|$|E

50|$|It faulted <b>the</b> majority's {{assertion}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> passport denials {{here were}} {{beyond the pale}} of congressional authorization {{because they do not}} involve grounds either of allegiance or criminal activity. It argued <b>that</b> neither of <b>the</b> propositions set out by the majority - (1) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary's</b> denial of passports in peacetime extended to only two categories of cases, those involving allegiance and those involving criminal activity, and (2) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary's</b> wartime exercise of his discretion, while admittedly more restrictive, had no relevance to the practice which Congress could have been said to have approved in 1952 - had any validity: the first was contrary to fact, and the second to common sense.|$|R
60|$|Of such inquiries, however, {{there were}} none. It was {{formally}} sworn to Lord Carteret by Green {{and his men}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>secretary's</b> messenger, Jerry--the fellow owned no surname--had shot Sir Richard in self-defence, when Sir Richard had produced firearms upon being arrested {{on a charge of}} high treason, for which they held <b>the</b> <b>secretary's</b> own warrant.|$|R
25|$|The {{position}} {{was formed in}} 1921, when the Parliamentary Committee of the TUC became the General Council. The position of Secretary has been a permanent, full-time position in the TUC since 1904. Before <b>that,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> was elected annually at Congress.|$|E

25|$|Seward's biographers {{generally}} agree <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> of State {{may have}} suggested an outright {{rejection of the}} Amendment.

25|$|The Constitution also {{establishes}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> of State {{should serve}} as acting governor when the Governor is unable to perform his duties.

The Fund's cash sweep percentage would be reduced from around 64% to approximately 36% following the sale. Revenue from the sale was used to diversify the Nuclear Liabilities Fund's assets.|$|E
25|$|Joint Combined Exchange Training or JCET {{programs}} are exercises {{designed to provide}} training opportunities for American Special Forces by holding the training exercises in countries that the forces may one day have to operate in, {{as well as providing}} training opportunities for the armed forces of the host countries. Typically, each JCET program involved 10–40 American special forces personnel, though can sometimes involved up to 100. The United States Congress permitted the use of funds from the military budget to be used in overseas training such as JCETs in 1991, providing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> of Defense submits to Congress annually a report on overseas training activities.|$|E

25|$|The {{legality}} {{of the decision to}} put Railtrack into railway administration was challenged by the smaller Railtrack Private Shareholders Action Group. Their action against the government alleged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> of State for Transport at the time – Stephen Byers MP – had, by deciding to cut off funding for Railtrack and asking the High Court to put the company into railway administration, committed the common law tort of misfeasance in public office. It is believed that there was £532 million available to Railtrack comprising £370 million in the bank and £162 million of an existing Department of Transport loan facility still available to be drawn down, but Stephen Byers MP cancelled this facility, causing shareholders to believe that he had broken the loan agreement.|$|E
25|$|As was {{indicated}} in the ex parte Fewings case, considerations {{that are relevant to}} a public authority's decision are of two kinds: there are mandatory relevant considerations (that is, considerations that the statute empowering the authority expressly or impliedly identifies as those that must be taken into account), and discretionary relevant considerations (those which the authority may take into account if it regards them as appropriate). Vasiliou v. Secretary of State for Transport (1991) {{is an example of a}} case in which a court found that a particular mandatory relevant consideration was to be implied into a statute. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> of State for Transport had failed to take into account the fact that an order to close off a particular street for redevelopment would have caused the applicant a substantial loss of business.|$|E
25|$|Kitchener and Asquith were {{agreed that}} Robertson should become CIGS, but Robertson {{refused to do}} this if Kitchener “continued to be his own CIGS”, {{although}} given Kitchener’s great prestige he wanted him not to resign but to be sidelined to an advisory role like the Prussian War Minister. Asquith asked the men to negotiate an agreement, which they did over the exchange of several draft documents at the Hotel de Crillon in Paris. Kitchener agreed that Robertson alone should present strategic advice to the Cabinet, with Kitchener responsible for recruiting and supplying the Army, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> of State should sign orders jointly with the CIGS (Robertson had demanded that orders go out over his signature alone). Robertson became Chief of the Imperial General Staff on 23 December 1915, with a Royal Order in Council formalising Kitchener and Robertson's relative positions in January 1916.|$|E
2500|$|The Federal District Court {{ruled in}} favor of Filburn. The Act {{required}} an affirmative vote of farmers by plebiscite to implement the quota.

The government then appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which called the District Court's holding against the campaign methods which led to passage of the quota by farmers a [...] "manifest error". The court then went on to uphold the Act under the Interstate Commerce Clause.|$|R

The agreement was formalised in a Royal Order in Council in January 1916. Robertson was suspicious of efforts in the Balkans and Near East, and was instead committed to major British offensives against Germany on the Western Front— the first of these was to be the Somme in 1916.|$|E
25|$|Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That in {{recognition}} of the gallantry of First Lieutenant Frank H. Newcomb, of the Revenue-Cutter Service, commanding the revenue cutter Hudson, his officers and the men of his command, for their intrepid and heroic gallantry in the action at Cardenas, Cuba, on the eleventh day of May, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, when the Hudson rescued the United States naval torpedo boat Winslow {{in the face of a}} most galling fire from the enemy's guns, the Winslow being disabled, her captain wounded, her only other officer and half her crew killed. The commander of the Hudson kept his vessel in the very center of the hottest fire of the action, although in constant danger of going ashore on account of the shallow water, until finally he got a line made fast to the Winslow and towed that vessel out of range of the enemy's guns. In commemoration of this signal act of heroism it is hereby enacted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> of the Treasury be authorized and directed to cause to be and to present to First Lieutenant Frank H. Newcomb, Revenue-Cutter Service, a gold medal, and to each of his officers a silver medal, and to each member of his crew a bronze medal.|$|E
