2500|$|Despite {{the clear}} {{implications}} of Thackeray's illustration on the topic, John Sutherland has argued against Becky having murdered Jos {{on the basis}} of Thackeray's criticism of the [...] "Newgate novels" [...] of Edward Bulwer-Lytton and other authors of Victorian crime fiction. Although what Thackeray principally objected to was glorification of a criminal's deeds, his intent may have been to entrap the Victorian reader with their own prejudices and make them <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of Becky Sharp even when they have no proof of her actions.|$|E
60|$|GEORGE. You try me pretty high, don't you, {{forcing me to}} come here, {{and speak}} before this fellow? Most men would <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst,</b> finding you like this.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{only gave}} her tea. Why not? She's my cousin. It's nothing! Why should you <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of me? She {{asked to see}} my chambers. Why not? I couldn't refuse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The captain {{says the}} glass is {{beginning}} to rise," [...] Mr. Atherton said as he met her the fourth morning of the gale; [...] "and that he <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> is over." ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{reporter}} from the Evening Chronicle branded him [...] "the permanently disorganised Sacha". A {{writer of the}} Teesside Gazette {{said that they would}} never consider Sacha as a [...] "dark horse" [...] type of character. A Daily Mirror critic jested [...] "Bumbling doctor Sacha has never been lucky in love himself, so it's no surprise that he <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> when he sees Essie becoming friendly with a colleague." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye, Fanny," [...] he said, [...] "and do not {{let them}} forget me in England. It is a great comfort to <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of your {{troubles}} are over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But I {{can hardly}} imagine Lizzie's {{actually}} doing wrong,' said Anne; 'we were certainly both naughty children, but I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> we did, was rather what makes nurses scold, than what would seriously displease you or Papa.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Hughs evidently thinks you're {{interested}} in the girl. You can't keep anything from servants and people who work about your house; they always <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of everything--and, of course, they know that you and B. don't--aren't---" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I'm not content! But as I {{seem to be}} helpless, the fools who {{can only}} judge by {{appearances}} and the others who are quick to <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of me must believe what they like. Anyway, their opinion doesn't count for much." ...|$|E
50|$|Has Ben Lyon {{forgotten}} his wedding anniversary? His wife Bebe thinks he has, and can hardly contain her fury. When his son Richard sees him dining with a glamorous French singer he <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst.</b> But Ben is actually buying tickets from her, and he surprises everyone {{with a family}} holiday to Paris. Once in Paris, there are further misunderstandings involving the singer, trouble with an antique car, as well as visits to a seedy nightclub and to the famous Folies Bergère.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bad enough," [...] {{said the}} parson. [...] "I've seen bad men before, but I <b>think</b> he's <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> I ever saw. What'll Mrs O'Kelly say of my {{coming in this}} way, without notice?" ...|$|R
60|$|ERMYNTRUDE [revolted, {{sinking into}} his chair]. I <b>think</b> it quite <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> pun I ever heard.|$|R
60|$|This, Aunt Jane did not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> {{part of the}} affair, and {{she said}} that the girl had been brought up to call the man Uncle Alfred, and very {{possibly}} did not understand that he was only so by courtesy, nor that he was so utterly untrustworthy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, father," [...] {{returned}} the boy, as he tossed and deftly caught the cake again, [...] "that {{it is more}} wonderful what men will eat when they're not starving! Of all the abominations that mortal man ever put between his grinders, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> is that vile stuff--" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{wanted to}} ask questions, but thought it wiser to wait. I knew enough already to make out that I had come upon {{the scene of a}} {{gigantic}} lumber steal. Buell's strange manner on the train, at the station, and his eagerness to hurry me out of Holston now needed no more explanation. I began to <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of him.|$|E
60|$|She laughed. I <b>think</b> it was <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> {{part about}} <b>the</b> woman, her laugh; it {{suggested}} so much cruelty.|$|R
50|$|The {{night before}} the wedding, Tracy gets drunk {{for only the second}} time in her life and takes an {{innocent}} midnight swim with Mike. When George sees Mike carrying an intoxicated Tracy into the house afterward, he <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst.</b> <b>The</b> next day, he tells her that he was shocked and feels entitled to an explanation before going ahead with the wedding. She takes exception to his lack of faith in her and breaks off the engagement. Then she realizes that all the guests have arrived and are waiting for the ceremony to begin. Mike volunteers to marry her (much to Liz's distress), but she graciously declines. She also realizes, for the first time, that she isn't perfect and shouldn't constantly condemn others for their weaknesses. At this point, Dexter offers to marry her again, and she accepts.|$|R
6000|$|... 'With your husband's money, Miss Catherine?' I asked. 'You'll {{find him}} not so pliable as you {{calculate}} upon: and, though I'm hardly a judge, I <b>think</b> that's <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> motive you've given yet {{for being the}} wife of young Linton.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know the}} affection {{you have always}} entertained for Iris. She {{will tell you what}} she pleases about the past. If she tells you nothing about her late husband, <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> and you will not be wrong. Remember that {{whatever}} she has done was done for me and at my instigation. She ought to have married you instead of me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't be so suspicious, Harry,' {{said the}} other--'don't try to <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of your friend. By others, by Sir Gregory Hardlines, Neverbend, and such men, I {{might expect to}} be judged harshly in such a matter. But I {{have a right to}} expect that you will believe me. I tell you that I did this inadvertently, and am sorry for it; surely that ought to be sufficient.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not {{accustomed}} to <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of people," [...] she said. [...] "I can scarcely picture to myself any person, already inordinately wealthy, singling out my father as a victim for his further cupidity. Let me return to the question which I have already asked you. Would you care, without letting my father know of this visit and my request, to return his cheque or promissory note, or whatever it was, in exchange for these shares?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{did not say}} she was too fond!" [...] Bellegarde exclaimed. [...] "Heaven forbid I {{should say}} {{anything}} so idiotic. She is not too anything! If I were {{to say she was}} ugly, I should not mean she was too ugly. She is fond of pleasing, and if you are pleased she is grateful. If you are not pleased, she lets it pass and <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> neither of you nor of herself. I imagine, though, she hopes the saints in heaven are, for I am sure she is incapable of trying to please by any means of which they would disapprove." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{questions}} {{also just}} happen, where if I’m in my car, you know, someone might cut me off, and I’ll <b>think,</b> “What’s <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> thing someone can do while you’re driving?” and I’ll write that {{down in my}} car. So the questions happen all the time.|$|R
6000|$|Colonel Elliot quotes, as in {{his opinion}} the best, stanzas viii., ix., x., xi., while he <b>thinks</b> xv., xviii. <b>the</b> <b>worst.</b> I give these stanzas - ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is always}} more or less danger, in a storm, lad; but I hope, and <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> is over. We {{are in for a}} heavy gale but, now that the brig has got through the first burst, there is not much fear of her {{weathering}} it. She is a capital sea boat, well found and in good trim; and we were fortunate enough in having sufficient warning to get her snug, before the first burst came.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what have}} we been walking for all night, {{like a pair of}} waif Egyptians?" [...] says I. [...] "Just because I was robbed of my purse and all I possessed in that unchancy town of Rotterdam. I will tell you of it now, because I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> is over, but we have still a good tramp before us till we get to where my money is, and if you would not buy me a piece of bread, I were like to go fasting." ...|$|E
6000|$|I saw {{the lawyer}} {{come out of}} the chamber first, but was above asking him any questions; the next were the executors and chaplain. I asked the last how they came to have words. He did not answer me directly, but begged to know whose {{pleasure}} it was to have the codicil annexed. [...] "It was mine, sir," [...] replied I; [...] "and it made me very uneasy before I could have the favour granted." [...] He only replied by saying, [...] "Ah! poor lady, the favour, as you are pleased to term it, is not calculated for any benefit to you; <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> you can of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{was talking}} {{now in the}} low, {{throbbing}} utterance of a man carried out of himself. [...] "It angers me to <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of these loafers, these drunken beasts, can glare at you--can speak to you. They {{have no right to}} breathe the same air with one like you." ...|$|R
50|$|After getting {{trapped on}} a balcony at Notre Dame Cathedral, the girls drop {{articles}} of clothing {{to try to}} get the attention of passersbys, to no avail. When Cornelia and Emily finally return to their hotel in their slips, they encounter Mr. Skinner's friend, actor Monsieur Darnet (Georges Renavent), and his friend, Pierre Cambouille (Roland Varno). To help them, the gentlemen escort them inside, but Avery <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> and hits Cambouille. A brawl erupts just as Mr. and Mrs. Skinner arrive from England, and Mr. Skinner insists that it is time for his daughter to return home. After bidding fond farewells to Avery and Tom, Cornelia and Emily board the ship home, ending their European misadventures.|$|R
50|$|The {{three men}} play very {{important}} roles {{in the lives of}} the four women, but most of the time, their actions are detrimental to the women. They are orthodox, unthinking, and not in control of their emotions. Satish brings about Savitri's downfall and acts strangely with Sarojini till the end, when he brings about a final reunion of sorts on Upendra's deathbed. Upendra helps Kiranmayi initially, but <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of her relationship with Diwakar, and actually causes Kiranmayi's compulsive elopement with Diwakar. Diwakar is weak-kneed and immature. An orphan, he is delighted by Kiranmayi treating him as her brother, and eventually shirks education. He acts totally irresponsibly after his elopement with Kiranmayi.|$|R
60|$|That {{theory is}} annihilated by M. Funck-Brentano. But {{the story is}} so strangely complicated; the astuteness and the credulity of the Cardinal are so oddly contrasted; a {{momentary}} folly of the Queen is so astonishing and fatal; the general mismanagement of the Court is so crazy, that, had we lived in Paris at the moment, perhaps we could hardly have believed the Queen to be innocent. Even persons greatly prejudiced in her favour {{might well have been}} deceived, and the people 'loveth to <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst,</b> and is hardly to be moved from that opinion,' as was said of the Scottish public at the date of the Gowrie conspiracy.|$|E
60|$|It is certain, as I {{formerly}} noted, rumour {{will break}} a tradesman almost at any time. It matters not, at first, whether the rumour be true or false. What rumour can sit {{closer to a}} man in business--his own personal misfortunes excepted--than such as this-that his partner is broke? That his partner has met with a loss, suppose an insurance, suppose a fall of stocks, suppose a bubble or a cheat, or we know not what, the partner is sunk, no man knows whether the partnership be concerned in it or no; and while it is not known, every man will suppose it, for mankind always <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of every thing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, I {{remember}} the doctrines of that wise man well, who without doubt {{had found a}} key to the gate of Truth, one key only, for, mark thou, Allan, there are many. Yet, man being man must know desires, since without them, robbed of ambitions, strivings, hopes, fears, aye and of life itself, the race must die, which is not the will of the Lord of Life who needs a nursery for his servant's souls, wherein his swords of Good and Ill shall shape them to his pattern. So it comes about, Allan, that what we <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> is oft the best for us, and with that knowledge, if we are wise, let us assuage our bitterness and wipe away our tears." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You think there's something? You don't believe I've {{come up for}} {{rest over}} Sunday? I guess mother herself didn't, and I could see your father {{following}} up my little lies as if he wa'n't going to let one escape him. Well, you're right. There is something. <b>Think</b> of <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> thing you can, Cynthy!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then I <b>think</b> {{things went}} <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> {{way for me}} that was humanly possible. She {{gave me a look}} of mere gratitude. [...] "Ah, thank you for that!" [...] says she.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the help}} of Discord, [...] "Hercules" [...] and Atalanta have a romantic dinner. Things go wrong and Atalanta sends [...] "Hercules" [...] back to the barn. Discord tells him {{that there are people}} who want to hurt Atalanta. Discord {{encourages}} him to go after the people who want to harm Atalanta; he finds them and snaps one of the men's necks. The next day, Hercules finds out about <b>the</b> death and <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst.</b> Back at <b>the</b> forge, Atalanta apologizes for the night before, telling [...] "Hercules" [...] that he is a child and she is a woman. He tells her about him defending her honor by killing the bully who wanted to hurt her. She escapes from him and runs into Hercules outside, he goes in after his double and leaves Atalanta outside.|$|R
