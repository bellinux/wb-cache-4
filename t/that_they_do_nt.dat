Most women explained <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not feel valued, <b>that</b> the minute <b>they</b> start a family they are written off, that nobody was willing to invest in them, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not have mentors, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not see women in leadership positions, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not see role models. On the other hand, the male interviewees explained that it would be awkward to mentor and instruct women due to their sensitive character and also <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not trust them with important assignments, assuming <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would break down. Most of them assumed that women would not want to travel or stay late at the office due to their commitments to their families.|$|R
