5|$|Bewick {{was also}} noted {{as having a}} strong moral sense and was an early campaigner for fair <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals.</b> He objected to the docking of horses' tails, the mistreatment of {{performing}} animals such as bears, and cruelty to dogs. Above all, he thought war utterly pointless. All these themes recur in his engravings, which echo Hogarth's attention to moral themes. For example, he shows wounded soldiers with wooden legs, back from the wars, and animals with a gallows in the background.|$|E
5|$|Nativity scenes {{have not}} escaped controversy. A life-sized {{scene in the}} United Kingdom {{featuring}} waxworks celebrities provoked outrage in 2004, and, in Spain, a city council forbade the exhibition of a traditional toilet humor character in a public nativity scene. People for the Ethical <b>Treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Animals</b> (PETA) indicates that animals in living displays lack proper care and suffer abuse. In the United States, nativity scenes on public lands and in public buildings have provoked court challenges, and the prankish theft of ceramic or plastic nativity figurines from outdoor displays has become commonplace.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of determination of early embryonic cells {{has been investigated}} using sea urchin embryos. An efficacious method of isolating blastomere pairs from the animal or vegetal half of sea urchin embryos was developed. The overt differentiation <b>of</b> separated <b>animal</b> and vegetal blastomere pairs resembles that <b>of</b> separated <b>animal</b> and vegetal hemispheres isolated by manual dissection. <b>Treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> blastomeres with LiCl caused them to display a morphology resembling that of isolated vegetal blastomeres. The effects <b>of</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> and vegetal blastomeres and <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> blastomeres with LiCl were examined {{at the molecular level}} using gut alkaline phosphatase and a spicule matrix protein RNA as markers of differentiation.

5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Cochrane argues that each school has an {{important}} contribution to make to animal justice, particularly liberalism and utilitarianism. He then outlines his own approach. He writes that, while talk of our political and moral obligations to animals is today more prominent than ever, it remains on the periphery of mainstream dialogue in political theory. He closes by arguing that this neglect is a problem for political theory, and that animals are owed justice. If the book's claims are correct, Cochrane concludes, questions concerning the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> should be considered some of the most pressing political issues today.|$|E
5|$|A diverse {{range of}} groups have raised issues, such as People for the Ethical <b>Treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Animals</b> (PETA), over the welfare of animals, {{governmental}} and social agencies over health issues and compliance with nutritional labeling laws, and unions and trade groups over labor relations and laws. These situations have touched on the concepts of animal rights, corporate responsibility and ethics, {{as well as social}} justice. While the majority of the disputes did not result in lawsuits, in many of the cases the situations raised legal questions, dealt with statutory compliance, or resulted in legal remedies such as changes in contractual procedure or binding agreements between parties. The resolutions to these legal matters have often altered the way the company interacts and negotiates contracts with its suppliers and franchisees or how it does business with the public.|$|E
