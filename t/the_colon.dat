5|$|In Swedish orthography, <b>the</b> <b>colon</b> {{is used in}} {{a similar}} manner as in English, with some exceptions: <b>the</b> <b>colon</b> is used for some abbreviations, such as 3:e for tredje ("third") and S:t for Sankt ("Saint"), and for all types of endings that can be added to numbers, letters and abbreviations, such as a:et ("the a") and CD:n ("the CD"), or the genitive form USA:s ("USA's").|$|E
5|$|During September 1909, a Japanese {{calling himself}} 'Nobu Taka' arrived in Mexico City {{for the purpose}} of {{challenging}} Maeda for what the Mexican Herald said would be the world jujutsu championship. After several months of public wrangling, Taka and Maeda met at <b>the</b> <b>Colon</b> Theater on November 16, 1909; Taka won. There was an immediate rematch, and four days later, Maeda was pronounced the champion. It was later revealed that Taka was, in fact, Maeda's old friend, Soishiro Satake.|$|E
5|$|In {{ascending}} cholangitis, it {{is assumed}} that organisms migrate backwards up the bile duct as a result of partial obstruction and decreased function of the sphincter of Oddi. Other theories about the origin of the bacteria, such as through the portal vein or transmigration from <b>the</b> <b>colon,</b> are considered less likely.|$|E
40|$|The length {{dependence}} of the spontaneous contractile activity of human colonic muscle was assessed in vitro. Muscle obtained from <b>the</b> right <b>colon</b> was more distensible than that of <b>the</b> left <b>colon.</b> This was true for all muscle layers. Maximum spontaneous active stress was exerted by both circular and longitudinal muscle layers of <b>the</b> right <b>colon</b> at greater degrees of stretch (p less than 0. 001) than those of <b>the</b> left <b>colon.</b> <b>The</b> contractile frequency of longitudinally oriented strips increased with length. The contractile frequency of intertaenial longitudinally oriented strips from <b>the</b> right <b>colon</b> was lower (p less than 0. 001) than that of strips from <b>the</b> left <b>colon.</b> <b>The</b> contractile frequency of circularly-oriented strips from <b>the</b> right <b>colon</b> (6. 25 +/- 0. 38 min) was higher (p less than 0. 001) than that of strips from <b>the</b> left <b>colon</b> (3. 35 +/- 0. 35 min). <b>The</b> human <b>colon</b> appears to consist of two distinct areas based on the mechanical behaviour of the smooth muscle during spontaneous contraction...|$|R
50|$|The scale assesses three {{components}} of the large intestine: (1) <b>the</b> rectosigmoid <b>colon,</b> (2) <b>the</b> mid <b>colon</b> and (3) <b>the</b> right <b>colon.</b>|$|R
5000|$|These score are {{assigned}} separately for <b>the</b> right <b>colon,</b> <b>the</b> left <b>colon</b> and <b>the</b> rectosigmoid <b>colon,</b> {{resulting in a}} maximum score of 15. A Leech score of 9 or greater is regarded as positive for constipation.|$|R
5|$|Bears of {{northern}} regions, including the American black bear and the grizzly bear, hibernate in the winter. During hibernation, the bear's metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute. Bears normally do not wake during their hibernation, and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. A fecal plug is formed in <b>the</b> <b>colon,</b> and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring. If they have stored enough body fat, their muscles remain in good condition, and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea. Female bears give birth during the hibernation period, and are roused when doing so.|$|E
5|$|Archaea were {{initially}} viewed as extremophiles living in harsh environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes, {{but they have}} since been found in {{a broad range of}} habitats, including soils, oceans, and marshlands. They are also part of the human microbiota, found in <b>the</b> <b>colon,</b> oral cavity, and skin. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in plankton {{may be one of the}} most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea are a major part of Earth's life and may play roles in both the carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle. No clear examples of archaeal pathogens or parasites are known, but they are often mutualists or commensals. One example is the methanogens that inhabit human and ruminant guts, where their vast numbers aid digestion. Methanogens are also used in biogas production and sewage treatment, and biotechnology exploits enzymes from extremophile archaea that can endure high temperatures and organic solvents.|$|E
25|$|All colon surgery {{involves}} {{only three}} maneuvers that may vary in complexity {{depending on the}} region of the bowel {{and the nature of the}} disease. The maneuvers are the retraction of <b>the</b> <b>colon,</b> the division of the attachments to <b>the</b> <b>colon</b> and the dissection of the mesentery. After the resection of <b>the</b> <b>colon,</b> the surgeon normally divides the attachments to the liver and the small intestine. After the mesenteric vessels are dissected, <b>the</b> <b>colon</b> is divided with special surgical staplers that close off the bowel while cutting between the staple lines.|$|E
25|$|Lymphatic {{drainage}} from <b>the</b> ascending <b>colon</b> and proximal {{two-thirds of}} <b>the</b> transverse <b>colon</b> is to <b>the</b> colic lymph nodes and the superior mesenteric lymph nodes, which drain into the cisterna chyli. The lymph from the distal one-third of <b>the</b> transverse <b>colon,</b> <b>the</b> descending <b>colon,</b> <b>the</b> sigmoid <b>colon,</b> and <b>the</b> upper rectum drain into the inferior mesenteric and colic lymph nodes. The lower rectum to the anal canal above the pectinate line drain {{to the internal}} iliac nodes. The anal canal below the pectinate line drains into the superficial inguinal nodes. The pectinate line only roughly marks this transition.|$|R
50|$|On the December 8 {{episode of}} Raw, Morrison and The Miz won the 2008 Slammy Award for Tag Team of the Year {{and also for}} the Best WWE.com exclusive, for their show, The Dirt Sheet. On December 13, at a house show in Hamilton, Ontario, Morrison and The Miz won the World Tag Team Championship for the first time, {{defeating}} Kofi Kingston and CM Punk. The duo then engaged themselves in a feud with <b>The</b> <b>Colóns</b> (Carlito and Primo). They later defended their titles against <b>the</b> <b>Colóns</b> but lost in a match for <b>The</b> <b>Colóns</b> Tag Team Championships.

5000|$|<b>The</b> large <b>colon,</b> small colon, and rectum {{make up the}} {{remainder}} of the large intestine. <b>The</b> large <b>colon</b> is 10 to 12 ft long and holds up to 20 gal of semi-liquid matter. It is made up of the right ventral (lower) <b>colon,</b> <b>the</b> left ventral <b>colon,</b> <b>the</b> left dorsal (upper) <b>colon,</b> <b>the</b> right dorsal <b>colon,</b> and <b>the</b> transverse <b>colon,</b> in that order. [...] Three flexures are also named; the sternal flexure, between right and left ventral colon; the pelvic flexure, between left ventral and left dorsal colon; the diaphragmatic flexure, between left dorsal and right dorsal <b>colon.</b> <b>The</b> main purpose of <b>the</b> large <b>colon</b> is to absorb carbohydrates, which were broken down from cellulose in the cecum.

25|$|Under {{ordinary}} conditions, <b>the</b> <b>colon</b> receives between 10% and 35% of {{the total}} cardiac output. If blood flow to <b>the</b> <b>colon</b> drops by more than about 50%, ischemia will develop. The arteries feeding <b>the</b> <b>colon</b> {{are very sensitive to}} vasoconstrictors; presumably this is an evolutionary adaptation to shunt blood away from the bowel and to the heart and brain in times of stress. As a result, during periods of low blood pressure, the arteries feeding <b>the</b> <b>colon</b> clamp down vigorously; a similar process can result from vasoconstricting drugs such as ergotamine, cocaine, or vasopressors. This vasoconstriction can result in non-occlusive ischemic colitis.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>colon</b> is {{the last}} part of the {{digestive}} system. It extracts water and salt from solid wastes before they are eliminated from the body and is the site in which flora-aided (largely bacterial) fermentation of unabsorbed material occurs. Unlike the small intestine, <b>the</b> <b>colon</b> does not play a major role in absorption of foods and nutrients. About 1.5 litres or 45 ounces of water arrives in <b>the</b> <b>colon</b> each day.|$|E
25|$|The fibers {{that are}} most {{effective}} in influencing sterol metabolism (e.g. pectin) are fermented in <b>the</b> <b>colon.</b> It is therefore unlikely that the reduction in body cholesterol is due to adsorption to this fermented fiber in <b>the</b> <b>colon.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{descending}} <b>colon</b> is <b>the</b> part of {{the large}} intestine from the splenic flexure {{to the beginning of}} <b>the</b> sigmoid <b>colon.</b> <b>The</b> function of <b>the</b> descending <b>colon</b> in <b>the</b> digestive system is to store the remains of digested food that will be emptied into the rectum.|$|R
50|$|Starting in November, <b>The</b> <b>Colóns</b> {{developed}} an on-screen relationship with The Bella Twins (Nikki and Brie), appearing in numerous backstage segments {{with them and}} The Bellas accompanied them to the ring. This relationship with the Bella Twins subsequently led to a feud with the World Tag Team Champions John Morrison and The Miz, as Morrison and The Miz flirted with The Bella Twins, and then defeated Carlito and Primo to win a date with them on Valentine's Day. The Bella were seemingly unable {{to choose between the}} teams, leading to Morrison and The Miz challenging <b>The</b> <b>Colóns</b> for <b>the</b> WWE Tag Team Championship, and <b>The</b> <b>Colóns</b> challenging Morrison and The Miz for the World Tag Team Championship, although each team retained their respective championship. The rivalry between the teams led The Bella Twins to fall out with each other, with Brie siding with <b>the</b> <b>Colóns,</b> and Nikki siding with Morrison and The Miz. On the WrestleMania XXV pre-show, <b>The</b> <b>Colóns</b> defeated Morrison and The Miz to win the World Tag Team Championship and become the Unified WWE Tag Team Champions, and they successfully defended the championships the following night on Raw.|$|R

25|$|Colonoscopy {{is similar}} to sigmoidoscopy—the {{difference}} being related to which parts of <b>the</b> <b>colon</b> each can examine. A colonoscopy allows {{an examination of the}} entire colon (1200–1500mm in length). A sigmoidoscopy allows an examination of the distal portion (about 600mm) of <b>the</b> <b>colon,</b> which may be sufficient because benefits to cancer survival of colonoscopy have been limited to the detection of lesions in the distal portion of <b>the</b> <b>colon.</b>|$|E
25|$|The cecum is {{the first}} section of <b>the</b> <b>colon</b> and {{involved}} in the digestion, while the appendix which develops embryologically from it, is a structure of <b>the</b> <b>colon,</b> not involved in digestion and considered {{to be part of the}} gut-associated lymphoid tissue. The function of the appendix is uncertain, but some sources believe that the appendix has a role in housing a sample of the colon's microflora, and is able to help to repopulate <b>the</b> <b>colon</b> with bacteria if the microflora has been damaged during the course of an immune reaction.|$|E
