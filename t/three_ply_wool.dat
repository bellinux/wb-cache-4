50|$|People, {{particularly}} women, {{would cut}} their hair regularly using quartz or flint knives. This hair is never wasted. It can be spun into long threads of yarn on a spindle rolled on the thigh and then plaited {{to about the}} thickness of 8 <b>ply</b> <b>wool.</b>|$|R
50|$|Whilst {{the other}} LFG two seat {{monoplane}} sports aircraft (the V 40, V 42 and V 44) produced in 1925 were all metal designs, the V 52 employed wooden construction. It also differed {{from them in}} having a braced, rather than wholly cantilever wing. This was built around wooden box spares, with <b>three</b> <b>ply</b> ribs and fabric covering. The fuselage was also wooden, with <b>three</b> <b>ply</b> covering.|$|R

50|$|Bouclé, or looped, yarns {{are created}} by loosely looping an effect yarn around a base yarn. They can be made of any type of fiber and are usually {{composed}} of <b>three</b> <b>plies,</b> or strands, wrapped around each other. The texture is created by spinning one of the <b>three</b> <b>plies</b> more loosely than the other two. Fiber artists who choose to create projects in bouclé yarn must use extra care because if not handled carefully, the loose strand may split and snag on the knitting needles or crochet hook.|$|R
50|$|Thousands of Monmouth caps were created, {{but their}} {{relatively}} low cost, and {{the ease with}} which the knitting could unravel, means that few remain. The picture of the brown hat with the carrying loop is from Monmouth Museum and shows this rare example, which was knitted from coarse 2 <b>ply</b> <b>wool.</b> The hem of the cap was created by turning up the outer edge and knitting it in. The crown of the cap was made by reducing the number of stitches in each row until just six stitches remained, with a button being added on top. Each hat was made weatherproof by felting, a process which reduced its size. The distance from the centre to the hem in this example varies between 5 and 6 in.|$|R

5000|$|Lace {{knitting}} is a {{style of}} knitting characterized by stable [...] "holes" [...] in the fabric arranged with consideration of aesthetic value. Lace is sometimes considered the pinnacle of knitting, because of its complexity and because woven fabrics cannot easily be made to have holes. Famous examples include the wedding ring shawl of Shetland knitting, a shawl so fine {{that it could be}} drawn through a wedding ring. Shetland knitted lace became extremely popular in Victorian England when Queen Victoria became a Shetland lace enthusiast. Her enthusiasm resulted i.a. in her choosing knitted lacework for presents; e.g. when in ca. 1897 the Queen gave a lace shawl as a present to American abolitionist Harriet Tubman. From there, knitting patterns for the shawls were printed in English women's magazines where they were copied in Iceland with single <b>ply</b> <b>wool.</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study was undertaken {{to investigate the}} mechanical response of four hybrid titanium composite laminate (HTCL) systems, each prepared using a graphite fiber reinforced thermoplastic polyimide as the adhesive in a unidirectional prepreg. Two of the four HTCL systems were fabricated with the titanium Ti- 15 - 3 alloy, while the other two systems were fabricated with the titanium Timetal Beta- 21 S alloy. Each HTCL system consisted of either <b>three</b> <b>plies</b> or four plies of the titanium alloy. Systems with only <b>three</b> <b>plies</b> of titanium had plies measuring 10 mils thick, whereas systems consisting of four plies of titanium had plies measuring 5 mils thick. The improvement in mechanical properties achieved by comparing the uniaxial tensile results of static strength at room temperature. Results included stress-strain curves, ultimate strength, strain-to-failure, initial modulus of the HTCL's, and {{the description of the}} observed modes of failure...|$|R

[...] It {{then looks at}} the position in Figure 2, after Kc6, and sees the evaluation [...] "mate in two ply." [...] These two evaluations are consistent with each other. [...] If the evaluation of Figure 2 were anything else, it would be inconsistent with Figure 1, so the tablebase {{would need to be}} corrected.|$|R
5000|$|Bristol {{paper is}} used for {{printing}} documents, brochures, promotional materials and envelopes. It is often used for water color painting. It is also used for paperback book or catalog covers, file folders, tags, and tickets. Another use is for scale models; some students use this kind of paper for the walls in their scale models. One-ply Bristol is thin enough to be translucent, and two and <b>three</b> <b>ply</b> bristol {{are the most popular}} thicknesses.|$|R

40|$|Advanced {{non-linear}} Finite Element {{models for}} the strength prediction of composite laminates normally result in long computing times that are not suitable for preliminary sizing and optimisation of structural details. Macro-mechanical analytical models, in spite of providing quick predictions, are based on properties determined from tests performed at the laminate level, making preliminary design and optimisation of composite structures still too costly in terms of testing requirements. To overcome these disadvantages, an analytical framework is proposed to predict the notched response of balanced carbon fibre-reinforced polymer laminates using only <b>three</b> <b>ply</b> properties as inputs: the longitudinal Young’s modulus, the longitudinal strength, and the R-curve of the 0 ° plies. This framework is based on invariant-based approaches to predict the stiffness {{and the strength of}} general laminates, and an analytical model to estimate the R-curve of balanced laminates. These laminate properties are then used in a Finite Fracture Mechanics model to predict size effects. The predictions for open-hole tension and compression tests are compared with experimental results obtained from the literature for five different material systems. Good agreement is observed considering that only <b>three</b> <b>ply</b> properties are used as inputs for the analytical framework...|$|R
5000|$|The {{starting}} position for Pong Hau K'i is {{shown on the}} left. The two players are [...] "Red" [...] and [...] "Blue", with Red being the first player. The central spot is left unoccupied initially. The first move must be Red moving either of their pieces to the center. By symmetry, those two possible moves for Red are equivalent. The first <b>three</b> <b>ply</b> of moves for the two players are forced, and will always result in the position shown at the bottom.|$|R
50|$|Finger core construction: Finger core {{engineered}} wood floors {{are made of}} small pieces of milled timber that run perpendicular to the top layer (lamella) of wood. They can be 2-ply or 3-ply, depending on their intended use. If it is <b>three</b> <b>ply,</b> the third ply is often plywood that runs parallel to the lamella. Stability is gained through the grains running perpendicular to each other, and the expansion and contraction of wood is reduced and relegated to the middle ply, stopping the floor from gapping or cupping.|$|R
40|$|The bellow {{subassembly}} of the {{gimbal joint}} has failed by fatigue. Almost all the convolutes of all <b>three</b> <b>plies</b> of the bellow {{were found to}} have fatigue cracks. Investigation revealed that the fatigue cracks have initiated at the weld-parent metal interface and propagated progressively in the circumferential direction. A sharp change in profile at the weld-parent metal interface appears to have resulted in severe stress concentrations leading to fatigue crack initiation. No metallurgical abnormalities were found responsible for the failure and fatigue appeared to be stress related...|$|R
30|$|However, when {{interfacial}} thermal resistances must {{be considered}} an important issue appears suddenly. First we {{must take into account}} the temperature discontinuity across the plies interfaces. The simplest possibility consists in duplicating the nodes at those interfaces. However the interfaces positions depend on the number of plies considered. For example when considering two plies (p= 2) the interface is located at λ = 1 / 2. When considering <b>three</b> <b>plies</b> (p= 3) the two interfaces are located at λ = 1 / 3 and λ = 2 / 3.|$|R

The sea is typified by undulating bands of stone, each band composed of <b>three</b> <b>plies</b> (almost the same type is to be seen in the glass-painting of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, as especially at Chartres). These bands would perhaps be hardly felt as very aqueous, but for the fish which are interwoven with them in a complicated manner, their heads appearing at one side of every band, and their tails at the other.|$|R

40|$|Reinforcing cement-based {{composites}} with continuous fibers {{is one of}} {{the most}} efficient ways to obtain high performance materials. In this paper a layers of knitted textiles with relatively simple fabric architecture was used to strengthen fiberconcrete beams. The objective of this study was to evaluate glass knitted fabric as reinforcement for fiberconcrete. For this purpose fiberconcrete beams with textile reinforcement in a form of <b>three</b> <b>plies</b> of glass weft knitted fabric (jersey) were produced. Four point bending test was used to experimentally investigate influence of textile plies on composite flexural strength. Obtained results were compared with material without textile reinforcement. The fiberconcrete reinforced by textile layers showed better flexural performance compared to non-reinforced fiberconcrete samples...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an {{experimental}} investigation {{is performed using}} acoustic emission (AE) technique to study the behaviour of crack initiation and propagation of woven carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) composites under static tensile loading. Three laminates with <b>three</b> <b>plies</b> each were manufactured and tested under tensile static loading. Damage was being monitored using AE technique with instantaneous AE hits energies being used as the damage parameter. Results showed that angle ply laminates experienced crack initiations at about 50 % of ultimate tensile strength whereas cross ply laminates and non-conventional angle ply laminates having one cross ply laminate experienced initiation of cracks at {{about a third of}} ultimate tensile strength. This early cracks initiation is believed to be caused by the presence of 90 ° plies that cannot take much load transversely. </p...|$|R

40|$|Stacking {{sequence}} listings {{are presented}} for fully uncoupled Extensionally Isotropic (EILs), Fully Isotropic (FILs) and Quasi-Homogeneous Orthotropic (QHOLs) angle-ply Laminates, {{with up to}} 21 plies. All are sub-sets of a definitive list of Fully Orthotropic Laminates (FOLs), containing generally non-symmetric stacking sequences that are characterized in terms of angle- and cross-ply sub-sequence symmetries. Dimensionless parameters are given for each stacking sequence, from which the ABD matrix is readily derived. Expressions relating these dimensionless parameters to the well-known lamination parameters are also given, together with graphical representations of the feasible domains for Pi/ 3 and Pi/ 4 EILs and angle-ply QHOLs containing two and <b>three</b> <b>ply</b> orientations. The feasible domain for Pi/ 3 FILs is represented graphically by a single point, whereas the domain for angle-ply QHOLs containing four ply orientations is represented by a single stacking sequence...|$|R
50|$|A liquid {{packaging}} board {{might be}} up to five plies and is formed on a multi-ply paper machine with online coating. The most common is to use <b>three</b> <b>plies</b> with a basis weight of about 300 g/m2. The base or middle ply is normally made of pulp from bleached or unbleached chemical pulp, CTMP or broke (waste paper from a paper machine). CTMP gives more bulk and stiffness. The top ply (inside) is made of bleached chemical pulp. The barrier coating depend of the application and might be applied on both sides. When induction welding is employed an aluminum foil layer is used for barrier protection and for heating. The {{back side of the}} board is the printing side and might have an extra ply made from chemical pulp of quality that is suitable for the printing applications. Liquid packages are normally heat sealed.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a technique}} for preliminary sizing of the adherends for cracked-lap-shear specimen to assure delamination instead of adherend failure. The cracked-lap-shear specimen {{is a popular}} specimen used for determination of mixed mode interlaminar fracture toughness of composites. Thin adherends, {{on the order of}} <b>three</b> <b>plies</b> thick, have been used successfully in the past for determination of fracture toughness of rather brittle matrix systems. However, the tougher matrices now being considered for composite applications require thicker adherends in order to get composite delamination rather than adherend failure. The optimum thickness is obtained on the basis that the critical value of the strain energy release rate is reached at the delamination front before the ultimate strength is reached in the adherend. By proper design the specimen would delaminate and not use excessive material or load. A simple analysis for the optimum adherend thickness and experimental verification are included...|$|R
50|$|In 1969, coins were {{introduced}} in denominations of 1¢, 2¢, 5¢, 10¢ & 20¢, with a 50¢ coin issued in 1975. The coins had the same sizes and compositions as the corresponding Australian coins, with the 50 cents matching the cupronickel dodecagonal type introduced in Australia in 1969. In 1990, new compositions {{were introduced}}, with copper-plated zinc used for the 1¢ and 2¢ coins, and nickel-plated steel for the 5¢, 10¢, 20¢ & 50¢. An aluminium-bronze $1 coin was introduced in 1995, replacing the $1 note. 2009 saw {{the introduction of a}} new smaller coinage from 5 to 50 cents. These were struck by the Royal Canadian Mint and are made with the <b>three</b> <b>ply</b> electroplate method. The 1 and 2 cents were also discontinued and withdrawn the same year. A thinner brass plated steel $1 coin was later introduced in 2010, gradually phasing out the older type.|$|R
5000|$|A Waldorf doll (also called Steiner doll) {{is a form}} of doll {{compatible}} with Waldorf (or Steiner) education philosophies. Made of natural materials, such as fine woollen or cotton skin toned fabric, generally filled with pure wool stuffing, hair and clothing materials are also made from natural fibers. The doll makers use techniques drawing on traditional European doll-making, the dolls appearance is intentionally simple in order to allow the child playing with it to develop the imagination and creative play. For instance, it has either no features, or a simple neutral expression. The legs and arms are soft and if flexible allow natural postures. They are ideally entirely natural. Dolls vary in the form best suited to the stage of development of the child; from a simple sack or pillow doll for a baby, a knotted or handkerchief style for a teething child, a simple doll with bulky limbs and either short hair or a hat for a toddler. For an older more independent child who can change clothing and dress hair, 'formed' limbed dolls with the ability to sit are introduced with changeable clothing and often longer hair, Typically hair on a Waldorf doll is made of pure wool such as mohair or boucle, <b>ply</b> <b>wool</b> or cotton. facial feature details on a Waldorf doll vary with the maker, generally simple stitches, sometimes painted but features are always a simple suggestion and ideally neutral, so the child can imagine the personality and mood of the doll and if the doll is awake or asleep. Some Waldorf dolls have small suggestions of noses. Skin, eye and mouth colors vary with each doll, ideally to reflect the colouring of the child for a first doll.|$|R

40|$|The {{problem in}} using plywood bonded with urea {{formaldehyde}} (UF) is formaldehyde emission, {{especially in a}} room with limited ventilation. To reduce formaldehyde emission, the glue can be mixed with catching agent. In this paper the effect of urea and ammonium carbonate as catching agent on formaldehyde emission and on bonding strength of UF bonded <b>three</b> <b>plies</b> made from jabon is discussed. The effect of catching agent type on formaldehyde emission is not significant while the effect of percentage of catching agent is highly significant on formaldehyde emission. The higher percentage of catching agent, the lower formal dehyde emission of plywood. The effect of type and percentage of catching agent on plywood bonding strength is highly significant. The higher percentage of catching agent, the lower plywood bonding strength. To meet formaldehyde emission of 0, 165 µg/ml it is recomended to use urea 14 % on the weight basis of liquid UF. The bonding strength of this plywood conforms with the Japanese standard, 1973...|$|R

In a spectacular finish, Caduceus passed the post half a length clear of Apmat, with the Victorian Maestro's Melody a neck away third and Fettle a close fourth. Caduceus received one of the most deafening ovations ever heard on a racetrack, but whilst the cheers were still sounding, the news was announced that a protest was lodged by Bert Alley against Caduceus being declared the winner. This produced a most unfavourable reaction from the crowd, strange in the circumstances for they had turned against their own local horse. The Stewards, however, dismissed the protest and Caduceus was the winner {{of one of the most}} exciting sporting events ever held in Sydney.|$|R
