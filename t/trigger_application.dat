40|$|The LHCb {{experiment}} at CERN uses {{a server}} farm to filter the events consisting {{of up to}} 4400 cores, which receives events {{at a rate of}} 1 MHz and filters them with a <b>trigger</b> <b>application</b> that has an output of around 2 kHz. Configuring and starting O(5000) instances of a very large <b>trigger</b> <b>application,</b> each consisting of hundreds of shared libraries is a formidable task and for the efficient operation of the experiment it is essential that this can be done very quickly and reliably. The architecture of the system and the mechanisms for distributing the software used by the <b>trigger</b> <b>application</b> affect the overall performance and the flexibility to make changes and run the applications with different trigger configurations. We analysed the performance of different alternatives for distributing the software in the farm and we evaluated them {{in the context of the}} real world tasks that are executed and also in terms of the overhead in the system, such as the network traffic and file system operations. We present the strategies that allowed us to optimize the configuration and the tools that can be used to perform this kind of benchmarks in similar systems...|$|E

40|$|Today {{there are}} two popular {{positioning}} technologies: GPS and cellular network-based positioning. GPS does not work indoors and in densely built-up areas, whereas GSM-based positioning is usually network provider-dependent and is sold as a for-charge value-added service. To overcome the limitations of both of these technologies we have developed our own GSM-based position estimation method. It works both indoors and outdoors, is network provider-independent, and does not require any ongoing charges. For our method we collect GSM base station signals and correlate these with concurrently collected GPS position readings. The collected data is processed to prepare a database of logical base station locations which is deployed on the mobile device and is used for calculating the user's current location {{based solely on the}} IDs and signal strengths of received base stations. We have devised four position estimation algorithms with varying performance requirements and accuracy. In most cases accuracy is within 100 metres, which is satisfactory for many general applications. Moreover, we have developed several value-added location-based service applications that make use of our positioning system, including a remote position request application, a location <b>trigger</b> <b>application,</b> and a position trail application. 1...|$|E
40|$|Android is {{the most}} widely used {{smartphone}} OS with 82. 8 % market share in 2015. It is therefore the most widely targeted system by malware authors. Researchers rely on dynamic analysis to extract malware behaviors and often use emulators to do so. However, using emulators lead to new issues. Malware may detect emulation and as a result it does not execute the payload to prevent the analysis. Dealing with virtual device evasion is a never-ending war and comes with a non-negligible computation cost. To overcome this state of affairs, we propose a system that does not use virtual devices for analysing malware behavior. Glassbox is a functional prototype for the dynamic analysis of malware applications. It executes applications on real devices in a monitored and controlled environment. It is a fully automated system that installs, tests and extracts features from the application for further analysis. We present the architecture of the platform and we compare it with existing Android dynamic analysis platforms. Lastly, we evaluate the capacity of Glassbox to <b>trigger</b> <b>application</b> behaviors by measuring the average coverage of basic blocks on the AndroCoverage dataset.

40|$|In Whren v. United States, the Supreme Court held, unanimously, that Fourth Amendment {{analysis}} was so radically objective that an otherwise legitimate search or arrest {{would not be}} invalidated even if an officer's decision to act was based on race. Although the Court has adhered {{to the view that}} the Fourth Amendment is applied objectively, the controversy over Whren's practical legitimation of racial profiling has only grown over time. This Article argues that it has become clear that Whren was wrongly decided, for reasons courts and scholars have not previously articulated. First, the Court never explained why it created a rule making motivation absolutely irrelevant when there was a readily available alternative, namely applying the standard applicable to review of prosecutorial discretion. Prosecution decisions are unassailable, unless they are based on unconstitutional grounds. The Court did not have to approve racial profiling to preserve the broad scope of legitimate law enforcement discretion. Second, since Whren, the Court has elaborated the reasons for an objective approach; these include grounds such as holding officers to objectively high standards and promoting even-handed law enforcement. The Court's aims would be promoted by prohibiting race-based searches whereas they are undermined by allowing them. Most fundamentally, searches or arrests motivated by race are "unreasonable" under the Fourth Amendment. First, based on the Court's precedents, other provisions of the Constitution inform Fourth Amendment reasonableness. A search based on motives violating other parts of the Constitution is therefore unreasonable. Second, under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, a search is unreasonable if it rests on an antecedent constitutional violation. Unless the Equal Protection Clause is a distinctly unimportant part of the Constitution, a proposition the Court has rejected, its violation should <b>trigger</b> <b>application</b> of the doctrine, just like violations of other provisions. Application of these principles would minimally affect police discretion, and it would remain difficult to prove that police engaged in illegal racial profiling. But, it would also eliminate Whren's unfortunate and influential statements that racial discrimination is constitutionally reasonable...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{submission}} to Congress of several proposed {{amendments to the}} Williams Act has again made tender offer regulation a controversial subject. Professor DeMott believes that the debate about regulatory reform can benefit from a comparative study of Britih and American tender offer rcgulation. She finds the British system instructive in three important respects. First, the British system specifically indentifies different kinds of transactions that resemble tender offers and regulates those transactions according to the hazards they create for investors. Unlike the American system, which imposes a single set of highly complex regulations only if a transaction qualifies as a tender offer under nebulous judicial definitions, the British system recognizes that certain acquisitions of {{a small percentage of}} a corporation 2 ̆ 7 s shares, while appropriately subject to some regulation, need not <b>trigger</b> <b>application</b> of the full panoply of rules. The author also notes that the bright line rules uscd by the British to define regulated transactions facilitate financial and legal planning and promote an orderly market for corporate control. Second, by enforcing a more rigorous view of fair and equal treatment of target shareholders than does the American system, the British system may discourage takeover attempts and bidding contests that benefit shareholders. For instance, the British require that a purchaser of thirty percent of target stock offer to buy out remaining shareholders at tihe highest price it paid for the stock. In the author 2 ̆ 7 s view, such a protective rule may be too costly: it may also be unnecessary in the United States, where minority shareholders may enjoy appraisal rights and may bring deritative suits against management more easily than their British counterparts. Third, by requiring that target management provide shareholders with an independent appraisal of each tender offer and obtain the sharcholders 2 ̆ 7 approval before engaging in defensive maneuvers that might defeat the offer, the British system provides a moderate {{solution to the problem of}} managerial conflicts of interest caused by hostile takeover efforts. Recognizing that some defensive role for target management may be appropriate. Professor Delfott argues that the British approach may be preferable to current proposals that defensive tactics be prohibited...|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} novel {{developed}} Position Sensitive Scintillating Muon SiPM- Detector (POS-SUMUS). This modular designed scintillation detector is capable to determine particle positions in two-dimensions with resolution {{of a few}} mm for minimum ionizing particles. POSSUMUS is usable for large area <b>trigger</b> <b>applications</b> with relatively few readout channels. Position resolution in the transverse direction is achieved by combining two trapezoidal shaped plastic scintillators to form one rectangular shaped scintillator module. Each trapezoid is optically insulated against the other. The amount of light produced by incoming particles is proportional to their path length in the trapezoid and thus position dependent. The longitudinal position resolution, along the scin-tillator rod, is determined by propagation time of light. In both trapezoids the scintillation light is collected by wavelength shifting fibers (WLS fibers) and guided to Silicon-Photomultipliers (SiPMs) to measure the position dependent light yield. The SiPMs are located at opposite sides of an WLS fiber, an automatic voltage adjustment allows for a stable gain of the detected light signals. Because of its modularity, the POSSUMUS-detector {{can be used for}} large sized <b>trigger</b> <b>applications</b> of different sizes. By combining several scintillator rods, position sensitive areas from 100 cm 2 to few m 2 are achievable.
