5|$|All ports {{have been}} {{replaced}} with either two or four combination USB-C 3.1 ports that support <b>Thunderbolt</b> 3 and dual DisplayPort 1.2 signals, any {{of which can be}} used for charging. The MacBook Pro is incompatible with some older <b>Thunderbolt</b> 3 certified peripherals, including Intel's own reference design for <b>Thunderbolt</b> 3 devices. Furthermore, MacOS on MacBook Pro blocks certain classes of <b>Thunderbolt</b> 3 compatible devices from working by blacklisting them. Devices using HDMI, previous generation <b>Thunderbolt,</b> and USB will require an adapter to connect to the MacBook Pro. The models come with a 3.5 mm headphone jack, although TOSLINK functionality of older generation MacBook Pros has been removed.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the same}} time, another {{proposal}} for the flag was initiated by Sister Nivedita, a Hindu reformist and disciple of Swami Vivekananda. The flag consisted of a <b>thunderbolt</b> in the centre and a hundred and eight oil lamps for the border, with the Vande Mataram caption split around the <b>thunderbolt.</b> It was also presented at the Indian National Congress meeting in 1906.

5|$|The second {{generation}} Mac Pro has a redesigned configuration of ports. It has a HDMI 1.4 port, dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, six <b>Thunderbolt</b> 2 ports, four USB 3 ports, and combined digital Mini-TOSlink optical / analog 3.5mm stereo mini jack for audio output. It {{also has a}} headphones mini jack (the two are distinctly selectable within the Sound System Preference panel, Output tab). There is no dedicated port for inputting audio. The system has a low-fidelity internal mono speaker. The <b>Thunderbolt</b> 2 ports support up to thirty-six <b>Thunderbolt</b> devices (six per port) and can concurrently support up to three 4K displays. This design requires two GPUs to support the seven display outputs (HDMI and six <b>Thunderbolt).</b> The I/O panel illuminates itself when the unit senses it has been moved {{to make it easier}} for the user to see the ports. Unlike the previous model, it has no FireWire 800 ports, dedicated digital audio in/out ports, a SuperDrive, DVI port, 3.5-inch drive bays for replaceable storage drives, or changeable internal PCIe slots. Instead, there are six <b>Thunderbolt</b> 2 ports to connect high-speed external peripherals, including enclosures for internal PCIe cards.|$|E

5|$|During the mid-1930s, George Eyston set many speed {{records with}} his Speed of the Wind car, powered by an unsupercharged Rolls-Royce Kestrel. In 1937 {{he built a}} massive new car, <b>Thunderbolt,</b> powered by two R engines to attempt the {{absolute}} land speed record. At first Eyston experienced clutch failure due to the combined power of the engines. Nevertheless, he took the record in November 1937, reaching 312mph (502km/h), and in 1938 when <b>Thunderbolt</b> reached 357.5mph (575km/h). When first built at Bean Industries in Tipton, the nearside engine fitted to <b>Thunderbolt</b> was R27 which had powered S1595 when it set the air speed record in 1931. The other was R25, used by the same aircraft to win the Schneider Trophy two weeks earlier. Eyston had also borrowed R17 from Sir Malcolm Campbell and, with the continuing support that Rolls-Royce extended to both Campbell and Eyston, he also {{had the option of}} using R39.|$|E
5|$|Elgato {{introduced}} a <b>Thunderbolt</b> docking station in June 2014.

It is typically used to plug a Macbook into an office setting (printer, monitor, keyboard) or to provide additional ports not available in the Macbook Air. A review in The Register said it was compact and useful, but Windows users should consider a USB 3.0 dock. The Register and CNET disagreed on whether it was competitively priced. Reviews in TechRadar and Macworld gave it 4 out of 5 stars.|$|E

5|$|In 1974, Eastwood {{teamed up}} with Jeff Bridges and George Kennedy in the buddy action caper <b>Thunderbolt</b> and Lightfoot, a road movie about a veteran bank robber <b>Thunderbolt</b> (Eastwood) and a young con man drifter, Lightfoot (Bridges). On its release, in spring 1974, the film was praised for its offbeat comedy mixed with high {{suspense}} and tragedy but was only a modest success at the box office, earning $32.4million. Eastwood's acting was noted by critics, but was overshadowed by Bridges who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.
