5|$|The Enugu Rangers, a first-division {{professional}} league association football team, is Enugu's {{home team}} that {{plays in the}} Nigerian Premier League and are based in the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium. Former Rangers players include Jay-Jay Okocha and Taribo West. Enugu's main sports centre is the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, named after Nnamdi Azikiwe, {{the first president of}} Nigeria. The stadium remained the centre of sports for the whole of the Eastern Region until the Nigerian Civil War broke out. At the war's end the stadium was refurbished. Enugu was a host for the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup games (24 October – 15 November) alongside Calabar and five other Nigerian cities with matches taking place at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium. Its hosting of the FIFA U-17 World Cup benefited Enugu through the renovation of the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, having had such <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> new artificial surface laid.|$|E
5|$|Many {{writers have}} speculated {{on the ways}} in which a {{friendly}} civilization might interact with humankind. Albert Harrison, a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California, Davis, thought that a highly advanced civilization might teach humanity such <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> physical theory of everything, how to use zero-point energy, or how to travel faster than light. They suggest that collaboration with such a civilization could initially be in the arts and humanities before moving to the hard sciences, and even that artists may spearhead collaboration. Seth D. Baum, of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, and others consider that the greater longevity of cooperative civilizations in comparison to uncooperative and aggressive ones might render extraterrestrial civilizations in general more likely to aid humanity. In contrast to these views, however, Paolo Musso, a member of the SETI Permanent Study Group of the International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, took the view that extraterrestrial civilizations possess, like humans, a morality driven not entirely by altruism but for individual benefit as well, thus leaving open the possibility that at least some extraterrestrial civilizations are hostile.|$|E

25|$|Plants {{use their}} leaves to {{intercept}} sunlight. The energy {{is used to}} reduce carbon dioxide from the air with electrons from water to make sugars (and other biomass) and a waste product, oxygen, {{in the process of}} photosynthesis. Leaves also respire, in a similar way to animals, by burning their biomass to generate chemical energy. This energy is temporarily stored in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which acts as an energy currency for metabolism in all living <b>things.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> waste product, respiration produces carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|Based on his {{experimental}} results, Wolfram {{developed the}} principle of computational equivalence (PCE): the principle states that systems found {{in the natural world}} can perform computations up to a maximal ("universal") level of computational power. Most systems can attain this level. Systems, in principle, compute the same <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> computer. Computation is therefore simply a question of translating input and outputs from one system to another. Consequently, most systems are computationally equivalent. Proposed examples of such systems are the workings of the human brain and the evolution of weather systems.|$|E

25|$|At this point, {{the thread}} is woven. Depending on the era, one person could manage {{anywhere}} from 3 to 100 machines. In the mid nineteenth century, four was the standard number. A skilled weaver in 1925 would run 6 Lancashire Looms. As time progressed new mechanisms were added that stopped the loom any time something went wrong. The mechanisms checked for such <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> broken warp thread, broken weft thread, the shuttle going straight across, {{and if the}} shuttle was empty. Forty of these Northrop Looms or automatic looms could be operated by one skilled worker.|$|E
25|$|Few of the {{historic}} cottages survived. Some are rentals or shops, though most have fallen to the demand for renovation. Many were replaced in the 1980s by condominiums. Others later yielded ground to modern hotels like the Elizabeth Street Inn and the Inn at Nye Beach], the first hotel on the Oregon coast designed to minimize its environmental impact via such <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> 58-panel solar array that can produce over 16,000 watts of electricity. Built in 2010, the Inn at Nye Beach (formerly the Greenstone Inn) acquired {{the site of the}} original Hub Cottages (later known as the Viking's Cottages, for decades the oldest continuously operating motel in Oregon).|$|E

[...] In 1938, Combs accepted an offer from a law school classmate named LeRoy Combs (no relation) to join his father and uncle's law firm in Prestonsburg. Prestonsburg was closer to his wife's home in Knott County. Combs' son Tommy suffered from a form of mental retardation, the result of an injury sustained at birth. After moving to Prestonsburg, Combs started a class for people with mental retardation, in part so Tommy could attend the class.|$|E
500|$|Aristotle, {{the most}} {{influential}} of the Greek philosophers in Europe, was a student of Plato and is also the earliest natural historian whose work has been preserved in any real detail. His writings on biology resulted from his research into natural history on and around the island of Lesbos, and have survived {{in the form of}} four books, usually known by their Latin names, De anima (On the Soul), Historia animalium (History of Animals), De generatione animalium (Generation of Animals), and De partibus animalium (On the Parts of Animals). Aristotle's works contain accurate observations, fitted into his own theories of the body's mechanisms. However, for Charles Singer, [...] "Nothing is more remarkable than [...] efforts to [...] the relationships of living <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> scala naturae." [...] This scala naturae, described in Historia animalium, classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical [...] "Ladder of Life" [...] or [...] "great chain of being," [...] placing them according to their complexity of structure and function, with organisms that showed greater vitality and ability to move described as [...] "higher organisms." [...] Aristotle believed that features of living organisms showed clearly that they must have had what he called a final cause, that is to say that they had been designed for a purpose. He explicitly rejected the view of Empedocles that living creatures might have originated by chance.|$|E
