50|$|In 1989 Tom Smith {{was brought}} into the track as the new General and Racing Manager and by 1991 he had {{acquired}} the lease. Together with his son Gavin they were always looking to improve the mechanical workings of greyhound racing from hare systems to drainage and they produced a new hare that would change the industry. They {{came up with a}} hare that was modelled on the older outside 'McKee-Scott' but it had modifications that allowed the hare driver to use a simple <b>turn</b> <b>switch</b> and then an even simpler hare rail at ground level with the wire running on pulleys underneath. Within a ten-year period the popular 'Outside Sumner' and older 'Outside McKee' had all but disappeared within the industry. The hare was known as the 'Swaffham' and this allowed the Smiths to set up a very successful greyhound parts company.|$|E
5000|$|As Mount Taurus, even Mulatière Castrum {{was owned}} by the Municipality of Rimini, not of the archbishops of Ravenna. Part of its history it has {{in common with the}} events of Vecciano: for the same reason in 1355 he {{submitted}} to the Holy See, which in 1358, at the hands of Innocent VI gave it to Galeotto Malatesta. The property remained until 1468 when the Malatesta, the death of Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, was occupied by Federico da Montefeltro. For a short time passed to Alessandro Sforza, to Montefeltro and then return as early as 1469. The Malatesta, in the person of Roberto Malatesta, tried in vain to seize the castle, but he remained the Montefeltro. In early 1500 the castle passed {{into the hands of the}} Venetians, dating to this period the description of the administrator who made the Venetian Malipiero [...] "high wall of the castle circundato steps 9, has had 4 wide passes, <b>turn</b> <b>switch</b> 150.

5000|$|The castle Cerasolo {{was outside}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the archbishops of Ravenna, and belonged to the Municipality of Rimini. The construction of Castrum Ceresolo dates back to 1200 and its first two decades of the events of 1300 are related to the wars between the Guelphs (headed by Pandolfo Malatesta) and Ghibellines (the Counts of Montefeltro). The crashes are a constant succession of assaults, destruction and retaliation: the Ghibellines who were able to conquer and completely destroy the castle. The reconstruction was the work of Galeotto Malatesta in 1380, remained the property of the Malatesta family until 1469, when it was occupied by the Holy See, and then by Federico da Montefeltro. In 1504 the castle was occupied by the Venetians, and the superintendent Malipiero gives us this description: [...] "Castle 4 miles away from Arimino which is in the hills, circunda high wall of step 8, without it, <b>turn</b> <b>switch</b> 110, in which poor habita 3 huomini in time of peace, of which there is a vice-captain.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} principles that {{are shared by}} all of these low-power adiabatic systems. These include only <b>turning</b> <b>switches</b> on {{when there is no}} potential difference across them, only <b>turning</b> <b>switches</b> off when no current is flowing through them, and using a power supply that is capable of recovering or recycling energy in the form of electric charge. To achieve this, in general, the power supplies of adiabatic logic circuits have used constant current charging (or an approximation thereto), in contrast to more traditional non-adiabatic systems that have generally used constant voltage charging from a fixed-voltage power supply.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Previous {{research}} {{has made significant}} advances in under-standing how humans manage to engage in smooth, well-coordinated conversation, and have unveiled the existence of several turn-yielding cues — lexico-syntactic, prosodic and acoustic events that may serve as predictors of conversational turn finality. These results have subse-quently aided the refinement of turn-taking proficiency of spoken dia-logue systems. In this study, we find empirical evidence in a corpus of human-computer dialogues that human users produce {{the same kinds of}} turn-yielding cues that have been observed in human-human interac-tions. We also show that a linear relation holds between the number of individual cues conjointly displayed and the likelihood of a <b>turn</b> <b>switch.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|A ringing {{free bit}} {{addressing}} scheme for magnetic memories like MRAM (magnetic random access memory) is proposed. As in standard MRAM addressing schemes the switching of a selected cell is {{obtained by the}} combination of two half-select field pulses. Numerical solutions of a single spin model of an MRAM cell show that the pulse parameters can be chosen such that {{the application of the}} half select pulse induces a full precessional turn of the magnetization (no switch) whereas the superposition of two half select pulses induces a half precessional <b>turn</b> (<b>switch).</b> With well adapted pulse parameters both fullselect and half-select switching occurs on ballistic trajectories characterized by the absence of ringing after magnetic pulse decay. Such ballistic bit addressing allows ultra high MRAM clock rates. 1 Comment: 16 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|Technical use {{of visual}} {{information}} in human machine dialog management presupposes a use of visual cues by humans. The current study tries to determine {{to what extent}} human subjects can use visual cues to detect Transition Relevance Places (TRPs) in prerecorded and annotated continuous dialogs. Subjects were asked to utter minimal responses to dialog recordings that were presented Audio-Visually, as well as Audio-only and Visual-only. Their responses were compared to <b>turn</b> <b>switch</b> delays in the original dialogs. Although there is unambiguous evidence that visual cues alone can guide TRP detection, the task proved to be difficult. An estimated {{three out of four}} responses were spurious. Audio-only presentation was felt to be easier, but the results of the full Audio-Visual presentation were more accurate. Some, as yet inconclusive, evidence was found for a timing effect of a gaze direction switch towards the listener. Index Terms: TRP, gaze, dialog 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} children’s online predictive processing as {{it occurs}} naturally, in conversation. We showed 129 children (1; 0 – 7; 0) short videos of improvised conversation between puppets, controlling for available linguistic information through phonetic manipulation: normal, prosody only (lowpass ﬁltered), lexical only (rhythm controlled and pitch ﬂattened), and none (multi-talker babble). We tracked their eye movements during the videos, measuring their anticipatory looks to upcoming speakers at points of <b>turn</b> <b>switch</b> (e. g., after {{a question and}} before an answer). Even one- and two-year-old children made accurate and spontaneous predictions about when a turn-switch would occur: they gazed at the upcoming speaker before they heard a response begin. By age three, children distinguished between different types of response-eliciting speech acts, looking faster to question- than non-question responses—but only when all linguistic information was available. By age seven, children’s gaze behavior also distinguished between rising and non-rising turns in the prosody only condition. These predictive skills rely on both lexical and prosodic information together, and are not tied to either type of information alone. We suggest that children integrate prosodic, lexical, and visual information to effectively predict upcoming linguistic material in conversation...|$|E
40|$|Neuroinflammation is a {{pathological}} hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases including {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS), and is characterized by activated microglia at sites of neuronal injury. In ALS. neurons do not die alone; neuronal injury is noncell- autonomous and depends upon a well-orchestrated dialogue between motor neurons and microglia. Evidence from transgenic models expressing mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD) suggests that the dialogue between motor neurons and microglia initially protects motor neurons. However, with increasing stress and injury within motor neurons, induced {{by the presence of}} misfolded proteins such as mSOD 1, mitochondrial function and axoplasmic flow are impaired and endoplasmic reticulum stress is induced; misfolded proteins themselves or alternate signals are released from motor neurons and activate microglia. Activated microglia, in <b>turn,</b> <b>switch</b> from anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective to proinflammatory and neurotoxic. Neurotoxic signaling from motor neurons promotes microglial release of reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory cytokines further enhancing motor neuron stress and cell injury and initiating a self-propagating cycle of motor neuron injury and cell death. A greater understanding of how to restore the imbalance between neuroprotection and cytotoxicity will depend upon a greater understanding of the motor neuron-microglial dialogue...|$|E

40|$|Turn-taking is {{essential}} to the structure of human teamwork. Humans are typically aware of team members' intention to keep or relinquish their turn before a <b>turn</b> <b>switch,</b> where the responsibility of working on a shared task is shifted. Future co-robots are also expected to provide such competence. To that end, this paper proposes the Cognitive Turn-taking Model (CTTM), which leverages cognitive models (i. e., Spiking Neural Network) to achieve early turn-taking prediction. The CTTM framework can process multimodal human communication cues (both implicit and explicit) and predict human turn-taking intentions in an early stage. The proposed framework is tested on a simulated surgical procedure, where a robotic scrub nurse predicts the surgeon's turn-taking intention. It was found that the proposed CTTM framework outperforms the state-of-the-art turn-taking prediction algorithms by a large margin. It also outperforms humans when presented with partial observations of communication cues (i. e., less than 40 % of full actions). This early prediction capability enables robots to initiate turn-taking actions at an early stage, which facilitates collaboration and increases overall efficiency.

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of genetic stability {{depends on the}} fine-tuned initiation and termination of pathways involved in cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair. Here, we describe a new pathway that regulates checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK 1) activity, a key element controlling both checkpoints and DNA repair. We show that the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 1 (USP 1) deubiquitinase participates in the {{maintenance of}} both total and phosphorylated levels of CHK 1 in response to genotoxic stress. We establish that USP 1 depletion stimulates the damage-specific DNA-binding protein 1 -dependent degradation of phosphorylated CHK 1 in both a monoubiquitinylated Fanconi anaemia, complementation group D 2 (FANCD 2) -dependent and -independent manner. Our data support {{the existence of a}} circuit in which CHK 1 activates checkpoints, DNA repair and proliferating cell nuclear antigen and FANCD 2 monoubiquitinylation. The latter two events, in <b>turn,</b> <b>switch</b> off activated CHK 1 by negative feedback inhibition, which contributes to the downregulation of the DNA damage response. This pathway, which is compromised in the cancer-prone disease Fanconi anaemia (FA), likely contributes to the hypersensitivity of cells from FA patients to DNA damage and to the clinical phenotype of the syndrome; it may also represent a pharmacological target to improve patient care and develop new cancer therapies...|$|E
