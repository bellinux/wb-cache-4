5|$|According to Chapter I, Article 28, {{paragraph}} 2 of the Constitution, {{the national}} colors of Poland are {{white and red}}. The Coat of Arms Act, Article 4, further specifies that <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>are</b> white and red in two horizontal, parallel stripes of equal width, of which the top one is white and the bottom one is red. If <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>are</b> displayed vertically, the white stripe {{is placed on the}} left from the onlooker's viewpoint. Attachment no. 2 to the Act shows the national colors in both horizontal and vertical alignment, as well as the official shades of both colors expressed as coordinates in the CIE xyY (CIE 1931) color space with the tolerated color differences (ΔE) specified in the CIE 1976 (L*, u*, v*) color space (CIELUV).|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{there is}} no attempt by the artist to soften the subject's {{brutality}} through technical skill. Method and subject are indivisible. Goya's procedure is determined less by the mandates of traditional virtuosity than by his intrinsically morbid theme. The brushwork could not be described as pleasing, and <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>are</b> restricted to earth tones and black, punctuated by bright flashes of white and the red blood of the victims. The quality of the pigment itself foreshadows Goya's later works: a granular solution producing a matte, sandy finish. Few would admire the work for painterly flourishes, such is its horrific force and its lack of theatricality.|$|E

25|$|Superficially {{lanthanide}} complexes {{are similar}} to those of the transition metals in that some are coloured. However, for the common Ln3+ ions (Ln = lanthanide) <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>are</b> all pale, and hardly influenced by the nature of the ligand. <b>The</b> <b>colors</b> <b>are</b> due to 4f electron transitions. As the 4f orbitals in lanthanides are “buried” in the xenon core and shielded from the ligand by the 5s and 5p orbitals they are therefore not influenced by the ligands to any great extent leading to a much smaller crystal field splitting than in the transition metals. The absorption spectra of an Ln3+ ion approximates to that of the free ion where the electronic states are described by spin-orbit coupling (also called L-S coupling or Russell-Saunders coupling). This contrasts to the transition metals where the ground state is split by the crystal field. Absorptions for Ln3+ are weak as electric dipole transitions are parity forbidden (Laporte Rule forbidden) but can gain intensity due to the effect of a low-symmetry ligand field or mixing with higher electronic states (e.g. d orbitals). Also absorption bands are extremely sharp which contrasts with those observed for transition metals which generally have broad bands. This can lead to extremely unusual effects, such as significant color changes under different forms of lighting.|$|E
25|$|Though {{some species}} are quite drab, the most {{conspicuous}} jewel bugs are often brilliantly colored, exhibiting {{a wide range of}} iridescent metallic hues that change with the view angle. <b>The</b> <b>colors</b> <b>are</b> the result of a combination of factors. Some species like Chrsyocoris stockerus and Scutellera nobilis display colors from multiple thin layers of pigmented chitin. The colors often change or become duller when the specimens are dried, due to the topmost chitinous layer becoming opaque and obscuring the colors of the bottom layer. The colors can be restored by moistening the surfaces with water.|$|E

25|$|Magna, {{a special}} artist use acrylic paint was {{developed}} by Leonard Bocour and Sam Golden in 1947 and reformulated in 1960, specifically for Morris Louis and other stain painters of the color field movement. In Magna pigments are ground in an acrylic resin with alcohol-based solvents. Unlike modern water-based acrylics, Magna is miscible with turpentine or mineral spirits and dries rapidly to a matte or glossy finish. It was used extensively by Morris Louis, and Friedel Dzubas and also by Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein. Magna colors are more vivid and intense than regular acrylic water-based paints. Louis used Magna to great effect in his Stripe Series, where <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>are</b> used undiluted and are poured unmixed directly from the can.|$|E
25|$|The {{style in}} which Bouguereau chooses {{to paint the}} {{children}} is articulated and meaningful. Their white flesh is luminous and rosy- a symbol to their purity. Wings sprout delicately from their shoulders. Bouguereau invokes whimsical elements of childhood and young love {{through the use of}} pastels and soft, velvety brushstrokes. The painting is mostly blue, an uncommon color for the portrayal of a love story. By not using pink and reds, the painter steers away from the theme of forbidden love and towards the idea of young love. <b>The</b> <b>colors</b> <b>are</b> cool and crisp. Bouguereau takes care to accurately portray the pudginess of Cupid and Psyche. The painting is full of texture from the light fabrics, wispy golden hair, and smoothness of their skin. The painting doesn’t strike the viewer but is a rest for the eyes.|$|E
25|$|In 1892, Francis Bellamy created {{what was}} known as the Bellamy salute. It started with the hand outstretched toward the flag, palm down, and ended with the palm up. Because of the {{similarity}} between the Bellamy salute and the Nazi salute, which was adopted in Germany later, the US Congress stipulated that the hand-over-the-heart gesture as the salute to be rendered by civilians during the Pledge of Allegiance and the national anthem in the US would be the salute to replace the Bellamy salute. Removal of the Bellamy salute occurred on December 22, 1942, when Congress amended the Flag Code language first passed into law on June 22, 1942. Attached to bills passed in Congress in 2008 and then in 2009 (Section 301(b)(1)of title 36, United States Code), language was included which authorized all active duty military personnel and all veterans in civilian clothes to render a proper hand salute during the raising and lowering of the flag, when <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>are</b> presented, and during the National Anthem.|$|E
