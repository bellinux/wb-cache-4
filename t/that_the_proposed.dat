In the same year, a National Bureau of Standards study concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> standard would present few problems. A year later, a COBOL-80 compiler was released to DEC VAX users, who noted that conversion of COBOL-74 programs posed few problems. The new EVALUATE statement and inline PERFORM were particularly well received and improved productivity, thanks to simplified control flow and debugging.|$|E
