50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gurney's</b> sugarbird {{is found}} from Zimbabwe southwards, except the extreme south of South Africa, {{where it is}} {{replaced}} by the Cape sugarbird in the Cape provinces of South Africa. It has at times been considered conspecific with <b>Gurney's.</b> <b>The</b> distribution of <b>the</b> <b>Gurney's</b> sugarbird is disjunct, and currently there are two accepted subspecies, one {{in the north and}} one further south.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gurneys</b> knew Francis Galton, {{through his}} wife Louisa Jane (née Butler). It was {{at their house}} that Gerard Manley Hopkins met Christina Rossetti and William Holman Hunt. <b>The</b> <b>Gurneys</b> bought works by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Emelia was a {{supporter}} of Emily Ford. She had been taken to Rossetti's studio in 1862 by Ellen Heaton, a friend.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gurneys</b> welcomed {{visitors}} and friends at Earlham Hall. Amelia Opie, the novelist, was an intimate {{friend of the}} family.|$|R

25|$|Witnesses {{described}} {{the mood in}} the execution chamber as somber, and Williams showed no resistance as he was led into the execution chamber. After Williams was strapped to <b>the</b> <b>gurney,</b> he struggled against the straps holding him down to look up at the press gallery behind him, and to exchange glances with his supporters.|$|E
25|$|Since the mid 20th century, modern {{urbanisation}} {{has transformed}} much of Penang Island. Skyscrapers and high-rises {{have sprung up}} all over the city, sometimes side-by-side with heritage buildings. Notable examples include the KOMTAR tower, and <b>the</b> <b>Gurney</b> Paragon Towers. Continuing urbanisation has also led to the mushrooming of residential high-rises in the suburbs of George Town.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gurneys</b> were {{influential}} and wealthy Quakers who established the bank bearing their name in 1770. (The family became sufficiently {{well known to}} be mentioned in Gilbert and Sullivan's 1875 comic opera Trial by Jury: a character describes his accumulation of wealth until [...] "at length I became as rich as <b>the</b> Gurneys". <b>Gurney's</b> Bank merged into Barclays in 1896.) ...|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gurney</b> flap {{was first}} {{applied to the}} Sikorsky S-76B variant, when flight testing {{revealed}} the horizontal stabilizer from the original S-76 did not provide sufficient lift. Engineers fitted a Gurney flap to the NACA 2412 inverted airfoil to resolve the problem without redesigning the stabilizer from scratch. A Gurney flap was also fitted to the Bell JetRanger to correct an angle of incidence problem in the design that was too difficult to correct directly.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s the School of Computing Sciences {{first opened}} at UEA, and the {{university}} started offering education degrees from Keswick Hall, a manor house owned by <b>the</b> <b>Gurney</b> family and situated {{on the outskirts of}} Norwich. Initially this was only a postgraduate qualification, until the late 1970s when an undergraduate course was created. The gift of a collection of tribal art and 20th-century painting and sculpture, by artists such as Francis Bacon and Henry Moore, from Sir Robert Sainsbury and Lady Lisa Sainsbury resulted {{in the construction of the}} striking Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts at the western end of the main teaching wall, one of the first major works of architect Norman Foster. The UEA's School of Fine Art opened in the same year of 1978.|$|E
25|$|By far, Gurney Drive {{has been}} {{touted as the}} most popular food {{destination}} in Penang, offering {{a wide variety of}} Penang dishes and seafood snacks. However, in recent years, prices at <b>the</b> <b>Gurney</b> Drive Hawker Centre have burgeoned due to its increasing popularity among tourists from outside Penang. The other notable places within George Town to sample Penang cuisine include New Lane, Kimberley Street, Chulia Street and Penang Road, with the latter famous for the two chendol stalls nestled at one of the side streets. Burmah Road at Pulau Tikus is also famous for a number of dishes, such as Hokkien mee. Meanwhile, the old market at Air Itam {{has become one of the}} more well-known places to sample asam laksa. Another popular Penang dish, char kway teow, can be found all over the city, with the varying opinions on the best-tasting char kway teow include Siam Road, Burmah Road and Carnavon Street.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gurneys</b> {{lived in}} London at 8 Kensington Park Gardens, from around 1854. She was {{a founder of}} the Kensington Society of 1865-8, a group of feminists, reformers and suffragists.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gurneys</b> had no {{children}} of their own; they fostered the five children of John Hampden Gurney, Russell's brother, from 1862 to 1865. They included the brothers Frederick, Alfred and Edmund.|$|R
50|$|When about {{eighteen}} Mary Anne {{visited her}} cousins, <b>the</b> <b>Gurneys</b> of Earlham Hall, and Catherine <b>Gurney,</b> <b>the</b> eldest daughter, remained her friend through life. She {{was also the}} guest of Anna Barbauld; and the winter of 1799 was spent in London. Mary Martha Butt met her at Bath about 1801, and described her as simple, agreeable, and unaffected.|$|R
25|$|Prost {{took the}} 1989 world title after a {{collision}} with Senna at the Suzuka Circuit in Japan, the penultimate race of the season, which Senna needed to win to remain in contention for the title. Prost had managed to leave the grid faster than Senna by removing <b>the</b> <b>gurney</b> flap from his car, which was unbeknownst to Senna. This reduction in aerodynamic downforce made Prost's car faster on the straights, but slower through corners- a clever choice to make it even harder for Senna to pass on a circuit already difficult on which to pass. On lap 46, Senna had finally come next to Prost and attempted a pass on the inside at the last chicane. Prost turned right into the upcoming corner, cutting Senna off and tangling wheels with him. The collision caused both McLarens to slide to a standstill into the escape road ahead. Prost abandoned the race at that point, whereas Senna urged marshals for a push-start, which he received, then proceeding with the race after a pit stop to replace the damaged nose on his car. He took the lead from the Benetton of Alessandro Nannini {{and went on to}} claim victory, only to be disqualified following a stewards meeting after the race. Senna was disqualified for receiving a push start, cutting the chicane after the collision with Prost, and for crossing into the pit lane entry which {{was not part of the}} track. A large fine and temporary suspension of his FIA Super License followed in the winter of 1989, and an irate Senna engaged in a bitter war of words with the FIA and its then-president, Jean-Marie Balestre, whom he blamed for his disqualification in Japan. Senna claimed that Balestre had forced the race stewards to disqualify him so his fellow Frenchman Prost could win the championship, though the stewards of the meeting denied that Balestre forced their decision, claiming that he was not present when the decision was made. Senna finished the season second with six wins and one second place. Prost left McLaren for rivals Ferrari for the following year.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene was}} first {{featured}} outside of [...] "Bart the Daredevil" [...] {{in the season}} four episode [...] "". When the clip is shown in that episode, additional footage is seen of Homer bouncing down the cliff the second time, and after he lands at the bottom, <b>the</b> <b>gurney</b> lands on his head. Contrary to popular belief, the second fall down the gorge (ending with Homer getting hit by <b>the</b> <b>gurney)</b> was not a deleted scene from [...] "Bart the Daredevil", but rather a scene animated exclusively for [...] "So It's Come to This: A Simpsons Clip Show".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{has been}} {{referenced}} in numerous clip shows and flashback episodes throughout the series. In particular, {{the scene of}} Homer plummeting down Springfield Gorge {{has become one of}} the most used The Simpsons clips. In the scene, Homer falls down the cliff on the skateboard, bouncing off the cliff walls and finally landing at the bottom, where the skateboard lands on his head. After being loaded into an ambulance at the top of the cliff, the ambulance crashes into a tree, and <b>the</b> <b>gurney</b> rolls out, causing Homer to fall down the cliff again.|$|E

500|$|A {{helicopter}} winches Homer out, slamming {{his head}} {{against the side of the}} gorge several times in the process before he is loaded into a waiting ambulance, which immediately crashes into a tree as it starts to leave for the hospital. <b>The</b> <b>gurney</b> carrying Homer rolls out of the back, and he once again falls to the floor of the canyon. Having arrived at the hospital he is put in the same ward next to Lance Murdock, where he tells him, [...] "You think you've got guts, try raising my kids." ...|$|E
