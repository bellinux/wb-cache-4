30|$|The vital {{governing}} factor {{influencing the}} machining excellence is the geometric and dimensional <b>tolerance</b> embedded into the product {{as well as}} into the process. The two main facets of <b>tolerancing</b> include the arithmetic and statistical <b>tolerancing.</b> In arithmetic <b>tolerancing</b> {{it is assumed that}} the detail part dimension can have any value but within the <b>tolerance</b> range; whereas, in the statistical <b>tolerancing</b> scheme, it is assumed that detail part dimensions vary randomly according to a normal distribution, centered at the mid-point of the <b>tolerance</b> range and with its ± 3 σ spread covering the <b>tolerance</b> interval.|$|R

5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter <b>tolerances.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania has a {{long history}} of stone arch bridges, {{including}} the oldest such bridge in use in the United States, the 1697 Frankford Avenue Bridge over Pennypack Creek in Philadelphia. Such bridges typically used local stone, with three types of finishing possible. Rubble or third-class masonry construction used stones just as they came from the quarry; squared-stone or second-class masonry used stones that had been roughly dressed and squared; and ashlar or first-class masonry used stones which had been finely dressed and carefully squared. Rubble masonry was the quickest and cheapest for construction, and had the largest <b>tolerances.</b> Many of the oldest stone bridges in Pennsylvania were built using rubble masonry techniques.|$|E
30|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of arithmetic <b>tolerancing</b> or worst-case <b>tolerancing</b> {{is that it}} does not follow any trend or pattern within the <b>tolerance</b> zone and part dimensions resulting from the machining process can possess any value within the <b>tolerance</b> zone. This results in checking up of each individual dimension for its correctness within the <b>tolerance</b> zone, which is impractical in mass production. The statistical <b>tolerance</b> overcomes this drawback of arithmetic <b>tolerance</b> and facilitates the machining to yield dimensions according to a normal distribution. Also statistical <b>tolerancing</b> allows some cancellation of variation from normal distribution. Hence, this paper in essence reflects the theme of statistical <b>tolerancing.</b>|$|R
40|$|Inflammatory <b>tolerance</b> is {{a crucial}} {{mechanism}} that limits inflammatory responses {{in order to avoid}} prolonged inflammation that may damage the host. Evidence that chronic inflammation contributes to the neuropathology of prevalent neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases suggests that inflammatory <b>tolerance</b> mechanisms are often inadequate to control detrimental inflammation in the central nervous system. Thus, identifying mechanisms that regulate neuroinflammatory <b>tolerance</b> may reveal opportunities for bolstering <b>tolerance</b> to reduce chronic inflammation in these diseases. Examination of <b>tolerance</b> after repeated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of mouse primary astrocytes demonstrated that histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity promoted <b>tolerance,</b> opposite to the action of glycogen synthase kinase- 3 (GSK 3), which counteracts <b>tolerance.</b> HDAC 6 in particular was found to be critical for <b>tolerance</b> induction, as its deacetylation of acetyl-tubulin was increased during LPS <b>tolerance,</b> this was enhanced by inhibition of GSK 3, and the HDAC 6 inhibitor tubacin completely blocked <b>tolerance</b> and the promotion of <b>tolerance</b> by inhibition of GSK 3. These results reveal opposing interactions between HDAC 6 and GSK 3 in regulating <b>tolerance,</b> and indicate that shifting the balance between these two opposing forces on inflammatory <b>tolerance</b> can obliterate or enhance <b>tolerance</b> to LPS in astrocytes...|$|R
40|$|Journal {{compilation}} © 2009 Blackwell Publishing LtdSalinity {{stress is}} a major factor inhibiting cereal yield throughout the world. <b>Tolerance</b> to salinity stress can be considered to contain three main components: Na+ exclusion, <b>tolerance</b> to Na+ in the tissues and osmotic <b>tolerance.</b> To date, most experimental work on salinity <b>tolerance</b> in cereals has focused on Na+ exclusion due in part to its ease of measurement. It has become apparent, however, that Na+ exclusion is not the sole mechanism for salinity <b>tolerance</b> in cereals, and research needs to expand to study osmotic <b>tolerance</b> and tissue <b>tolerance.</b> Here, we develop assays for high throughput quantification of Na+ exclusion, Na+ tissue <b>tolerance</b> and osmotic <b>tolerance</b> in 12 Triticum monococcum accessions, mainly using commercially available image capture and analysis equipment.

5|$|Injection {{moulding}} {{consists of}} the high pressure injection of the raw material into a mould which shapes the polymer into the desired shape. Moulds can be of a single cavity or multiple cavities. In multiple cavity moulds, each cavity can be identical and form the same parts or can be unique and form multiple different geometries during a single cycle. Moulds are generally made from tool steels, but stainless steels and aluminium moulds are suitable for certain applications. Aluminium moulds are typically ill-suited for high volume production or parts with narrow dimensional <b>tolerances,</b> as they have inferior mechanical properties and {{are more prone to}} wear, damage, and deformation during the injection and clamping cycles; however, aluminium moulds are cost-effective in low-volume applications, as mould fabrication costs and time are considerably reduced. Many steel moulds are designed to process well over a million parts during their lifetime and can cost {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} to fabricate.|$|E
5|$|Targets for NIF are {{extremely}} expensive. Each one {{consists of a}} small open ended metal cylinder with transparent double-pane windows sealing each end. In order to efficiently convert the driver laser's light to the x-rays that drive the compression, the cylinder has to be coated in gold or other heavy metals. Inside, suspended on fine plastic wires, is a hollow plastic sphere containing the fuel. In order to provide symmetrical implosion, the metal cylinder and plastic sphere have extremely high machining <b>tolerances.</b> The fuel, normally a gas at room temperature, is deposited inside the sphere and then cryogenically frozen until it sticks {{to the inside of}} the sphere.

40|$|Recent {{work on the}} {{specificity}} of metal <b>tolerance</b> in higher plants has suggested a multiple <b>tolerance</b> syndrome that is governed by common genes for <b>tolerance</b> to many metals. Previous work on metal <b>tolerance</b> in Mimulus guttatus Fischer ex DC reported <b>tolerance</b> to copper, lead, nickel, and zinc and suggested {{that this could be}} due to a multiple <b>tolerance</b> syndrome. To test whether nickel confers <b>tolerance</b> to other metals in this species, we used segregating nickel-tolerant and non-tolerant genetic lines and screened them for <b>tolerance</b> to 12 other metals (Co, CrIII and VI, Fe, Hg, Mg, Mn, Mo, Pb, Se, Sn, Zn and Zr). The genetic lines were derived from crosses between individuals from an uncontaminated pasture, a copper mine (Copperopolis) and a serpentine region in California, U. S. A. The populations were initially screened for <b>tolerance</b> to Co, Cr, Hg, Ni and Zn. The serpentine population exhibited the highest <b>tolerance</b> to nickel and the Copperopolis population showed the highest chromium <b>tolerance.</b> Individuals from the Copperopolis mine and serpentine populations that showed high <b>tolerance</b> to nickel were crossed to a non-tolerant (CL 40) and between each other to obtain the F 1 generation and the progeny were screened for <b>tolerance</b> to the 12 metals. The copper mine's F 1 generation exhibited <b>tolerance</b> to Cu and Zn, and those derived from the serpentine to Mo and Zn. High nickel tolerants from the F 1 population were then backcrossed to segregate the nickel <b>tolerance</b> character. Segregating tolerant and non-tolerant lines were re-tested for <b>tolerance</b> to 12 metals to analyse for co-tolerance to nickel. The results showed that nickel <b>tolerance</b> does not confer pleiotropic <b>tolerance</b> to any of the metals tested. The <b>tolerance</b> to other metals observed in the F 1 generation is therefore the result of independent gene(s). The data suggest that <b>tolerance</b> to many metals in M. guttatus is due to multiple metal <b>tolerance</b> which is caused by independent genetic mechanisms for specific metals.

5|$|It {{had become}} {{apparent}} in around 1987 {{that a number}} of units already in the field were not up to specification. In particular, it was becoming increasingly difficult to obtain KEF drivers of acceptable <b>tolerances,</b> particular the woofer. Measurements of the 1–1.5kHz peak of some units produced at the time were up to 6dB higher. KEF underwent a program to improve consistency of both drive-unit and the associated crossover, taking care not to alter frequency characteristics or tonal balances. KEF specially redesigned the B110, creating the B110 SP1228 where the surround changed from neoprene to a vinyl compound. KEF also designed a new crossover, designated SP2128. The crossover, also redesigned to accommodate the changes, saw its overall impedance fall to 11 ohms from the original 15 ohms. KEF also manufactured and supplied the crossover with the drive units in kits where the pairs have been electrically matched by computer to ensure balanced performance. Martin Colloms had implied in Hi-fi News in August 1988 that the BBC had taken a pragmatic decision to a revise the design, to ensure that targeted production levels could be maintained.|$|E
5|$|The nymph is the {{dominant}} life history stage of the mayfly. Different insect species vary in their tolerance to water pollution, but in general, the larval stages of mayflies, stoneflies (Plecoptera) and caddis flies (Trichoptera) are susceptible {{to a number of}} pollutants including sewage, pesticides and industrial effluent. In general, mayflies are particularly sensitive to acidification, but <b>tolerances</b> vary, and certain species are exceptionally tolerant to heavy metal contamination and to low pH levels. Ephemerellidae are among the most tolerant groups and Siphlonuridae and Caenidae the least. The adverse effects on the insects of pollution may be either lethal or sub-lethal, in the latter case resulting in altered enzyme function, poor growth, changed behaviour or lack of reproductive success. As important parts of the food chain, pollution can cause knock-on effects to other organisms; a dearth of herbivorous nymphs can cause overgrowth of algae, and a scarcity of predacious nymphs can result in an over-abundance of their prey species. Fish that feed on mayfly nymphs that have bioaccumulated heavy metals are themselves at risk. Adult female mayflies find water by detecting the polarization of reflected light. They are easily fooled by other polished surfaces which can act as traps for swarming mayflies.|$|E
