25|$|Controlling {{water vapor}} in air {{is a key}} concern in the heating, ventilating, and {{air-conditioning}} (HVAC) industry. <b>Thermal</b> <b>comfort</b> depends on the moist air conditions. Non-human comfort situations are called refrigeration, and also are affected by water vapor. For example, many food stores, like supermarkets, utilize open chiller cabinets, or food cases, which can significantly lower the water vapor pressure (lowering humidity). This practice delivers several benefits as well as problems.|$|E
25|$|Air {{conditioning}} is {{the cooling}} and de-humidification of indoor air for <b>thermal</b> <b>comfort.</b> Using {{a system of}} coils {{as a solution to}} cool and remove moisture from muggy air in a printing plant that was wrinkling magazine pages, Willis Carrier invented and manufactured the world's first mechanical air conditioning unit in 1902. Carrier's invention – encompassing the first system to provide man-made control over temperature, humidity, ventilation and air quality, was first installed as a solution to the quality problems experienced at a Brooklyn printing plant, Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing and Publishing Company. Air conditioning not only spawned a company and an industry, but also brought about profound economic, social and cultural changes.|$|E

25|$|Moisture {{management}} and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture {{management and}} humidity control may conflict with efforts {{to try to}} optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, Moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply Make Up Air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the higher temperatures sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, {{for most of the}} US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to provide <b>thermal</b> <b>comfort</b> indoors. However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold growth and moisture indoors is associated with a higher prevalence of occupant respiratory problems.|$|E
25|$|Early human {{settlements}} were dependent on proximity to water and, {{depending on the}} lifestyle, other natural resources used for subsistence, such as populations of animal prey for hunting and arable land for growing crops and grazing livestock. But humans have a great capacity for altering their habitats by means of technology, through irrigation, urban planning, construction, transport, manufacturing goods, deforestation and desertification, but {{human settlements}} continue to be vulnerable to natural disasters, especially those placed in hazardous locations and characterized by lack of quality of construction. Deliberate habitat alteration is often done {{with the goals of}} increasing material wealth, increasing <b>thermal</b> <b>comfort,</b> improving the amount of food available, improving aesthetics, or improving ease of access to resources or other human settlements. With the advent of large-scale trade and transport infrastructure, proximity to these resources has become unnecessary, and in many places, these factors are no longer a driving force behind the growth and decline of a population. Nonetheless, the manner in which a habitat is altered is often a major determinant in population change.|$|E

40|$|International audienceNatural {{ventilation}} {{helps to}} cool buildings in summer without energy consumption, but its application may be restricted by acoustic and glare constraints. Here, a modelling approach integrating different physical aspects {{was developed and}} connected to TRNSYS. Different control strategies of glazed openings were defined and simulations were performed with an office room and a detached family house. We find the natural ventilation potential is largely reduced due to acoustic and visual comfort constraints. An acoustic shutter, which facilitates more frequent window opening during occupancy by decreasing outdoor noise transmission, was equally studied in detail {{with the help of}} this modelling approach. The acoustic shutter improves the acoustic and <b>thermal</b> <b>comforts</b> for intelligent control strategy and is an attractive solution to enhance the natural ventilation potential under a moderate noisy environment...|$|R

In this paper, a novel test procedure and new index based on measurements on the sweating fabric manikin-Walter are proposed to quantify and measure the dynamic {{thermal properties}} of clothing ensembles. Experiments showed that the new index is correlated to the changing rate of the body temperature of the wearer, which is an important indicator of <b>thermal</b> transient <b>comfort.</b> Clothing ensembles having higher values of the index means the wearer will have a faster changing rate of body temperature and shorter duration before approaching a dangerous thermo-physiological state, when he changes from 'resting' to 'exercising' mode.

40|$|Abstract. The paper aims to {{approach}} in an original manner both the research method and {{the solution to}} the problem related to <b>thermal</b> physiological <b>comfort</b> by introducing the Peltier cells {{in the structure of the}} clothing product. The special clothing piece studied for tests during wearing is a protective clothing for firefighters; between its layers were introduced temperature and humidity transducers. The electric scheme and the transducers connection scheme, as well as the Peltier cells connection and power scheme were made. The data registration and the graphics were made using the PC-Lab 2000 SE software. The experiment included three distinct phases: a rest period of 10 min, physical effort for 20 min which simulates the effort made during an activity specific for firefighters and 10 minutes of rest after this exercise. The temperature and humidity charts were recorded and analyzed for each stage, if the garment is unequipped and then equipped with Peltier cells. If, in the case of physical effort, significant temperature variations in the underclothing environment were noticed, by introducing the Peltier cells, an optimization of the <b>thermal</b> physiological <b>comfort</b> was performed, with implications on the wearer’s health...|$|R

40|$|In this study, test {{reference}} year (TRY) data for three UK cities are {{generated from the}} new UKCP 09 climate change projections 1 {{for a variety of}} future time horizons and carbon emission scenario assumptions. The data are applied to the energy simulation of three commercial buildings and one house for the three city locations (London, Manchester and Edinburgh), three future time horizons in this century and three carbon emission scenarios. Results are compared with those generated using alternative TRYs from two other research groups who used UKCP 091 {{as well as with the}} existing TRY data sets which form the CIBSE Future Weather Years 2 in order to produce robust results. Results of future simulations of peak summer operative temperatures, peak cooling demand, annual cooling energy, peak heating demand and annual heating energy are presented for the four building case studies benchmarked against control weather data for the period 1960 – 1989. The results show increasing internal operative temperatures (non-air-conditioned) and increasing air-conditioning demands (air-conditioned) throughout this century and though peak heating demands remain similar to control data, annual heating energy consumptions can be expected to fall sharply. Practical applications: Currently, practitioners can use Test Reference Years for use in building energy simulations. In 2009, the CIBSE released Future Weather Years, which go further by allowing practitioners to explore the <b>thermal</b> and <b>comfort</b> behaviour of buildings at future time horizons thus helping to ‘future proof’ a design. In 2009, the United Kingdom Climate Impacts Programme released a new generation of climate change scenario data (the UKCP 09 climate change projections) using probabilistic methods. These are the most comprehensive data yet and provides a greater degree of detail than was available to generate the CIBSE Future Weather Years. It is therefore likely that the new data will gradually become the normal basis for investigating future building <b>thermal</b> and <b>comfort</b> response. In this study, a sample of TRY is generated from the UKCP 09 data and applied to the simulation of a sample of ‘real’ buildings. The results are compared with both the existing CIBSE Future Weather Years as well as with Test Reference Years generated using UKCP 09 by two other research groups.
