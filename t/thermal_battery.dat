Over the course of a 365-day year, the work replicates the movements of the sun, moon, and stars across the sky as they would appear at the Nevada site. The mirrors adjust their positions in real time according to the position of the sun. Over a 24-hour period the virtual camera view of the tower shifts, following the movement of the mirrors, from ground level to an overhead satellite view.|$|E
2500|$|Low Temperature Geothermal {{refers to}} the use of the outer crust of the earth as a <b>Thermal</b> <b>Battery</b> to {{facilitate}} Renewable thermal energy for heating and cooling buildings, and other refrigeration and industrial uses. [...] In this form of Geothermal, a Geothermal Heat Pump and Ground-coupled heat exchanger are used together to move heat energy into the earth (for cooling) and out of the earth (for heating) on a varying seasonal basis. [...] Low temperature Geothermal (generally referred to as [...] "GHP") is an increasingly important renewable technology because it both reduces total annual energy loads associated with heating and cooling, and it also flattens the electric demand curve eliminating the extreme summer and winter peak electric supply requirements. [...] Thus Low Temperature Geothermal/GHP is becoming an increasing national priority with multiple tax credit support and focus as part of the ongoing movement toward Net Zero Energy. [...] New York City has even just passed a law to require GHP anytime is shown to be economical with 20 year financing including the Socialized Cost of Carbon.|$|E

40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>batteries</b> have {{excellent}} mechanical robustness, reliability, and long shelf life. Due to these characteristics {{as well as}} their unique activation mechanism, <b>thermal</b> <b>batteries</b> are widely adopted as military power sources. Li(Si) /FeS 2 <b>thermal</b> <b>batteries,</b> which are used mostly in these days, use LiCl-KCl and LiBr-LiCl-LiF as molten salt electrolyte. However, it is known that Li(Si) /FeS 2 <b>thermal</b> <b>batteries</b> have high internal resistance. Especially, FeS 2 cathode accounts for the greater part of internal resistance in unit cell. Many efforts have been put into to decrease the internal resistance of <b>thermal</b> <b>batteries,</b> which result in the development of new electrode material and new electrode manufacturing processes. But the applications of these new materials and processes are in some cases very expensive and need complicated additional processes. In this study, internal resistance study was conducted by adding carbon black and carbon nano-tube, which has high electron conductivity, into the FeS 2 cathode.

5000|$|Heat energy can {{be added}} to or removed from a GHEX <b>Thermal</b> <b>Battery</b> at any point in time. However, they are most often used as an [...] "Annual-Cycle Thermal Battery" [...] where energy is {{extracted}} from a building during the summer season to cool a building and added to the GHEX, and then that same energy is later extracted from the GHEX in the winter season to heat the building. This annual cycle of energy addition and subtraction is highly predictable based on energy modeling of the building served. A <b>Thermal</b> <b>Battery</b> used in this mode is a Renewable Energy source as the energy extracted in the winter will be restored to the GHEX the next summer in a continually repeating cycle.

50|$|A {{thermal energy}} battery is a {{physical}} structure used {{for the purpose of}} storing and releasing thermal energy—see also thermal energy storage. Such a <b>thermal</b> <b>battery</b> (a.k.a. TBat) allows energy available at one time to be temporarily stored and then released at another time. The basic principles involved in a <b>thermal</b> <b>battery</b> occur at the atomic level of matter, with energy being added to or taken from either a solid mass or a liquid volume which causes the substance's temperature to change. Some thermal batteries also involve causing a substance to transition thermally through a phase transition which causes even more energy to be stored and released due to the delta enthalpy of fusion or delta enthalpy of vaporization.|$|E
5000|$|The B61 also {{features}} a [...] "command disable" [...] mechanism, which functions as follows: after entering the correct 3-digit numeric code it is then possible to turn a dial to [...] "DI" [...] and pull back a T-shaped handle which comes away in the user's hand. This action releases a spring-loaded firing pin which fires the percussion cap on an MC4246A <b>thermal</b> <b>battery,</b> powering it up. Electrical power from the <b>thermal</b> <b>battery</b> is sufficient to [...] "fry" [...] the internal circuitry of the bomb, destroying critical mechanisms without causing detonation. This makes the bomb incapable of being used. Any B61 which has had the command disable facility used must be returned to Pantex for repair.|$|E
5000|$|GHEX <b>thermal</b> <b>batteries</b> are {{implemented}} in two forms. The picture above depicts {{what is known}} as a [...] "horizontal" [...] GHEX where trenching is used to place an amount of pipe in a closed loop in the ground.

50|$|The {{advantage}} {{of using a}} phase change {{in this way is}} that a given mass of material can absorb a large quantity of energy without its temperature changing.
