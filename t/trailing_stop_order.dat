50|$|A <b>trailing</b> <b>stop</b> <b>order</b> is entered with a stop {{parameter}} {{that creates}} a moving or trailing activation price, hence the name. This parameter is entered as a percentage change or actual specific amount of rise (or fall) in the security price. Trailing stop sell orders are used to maximize and protect profit as a stock's price rises and limit losses when its price falls.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{a trader}} has bought stock ABC at $10.00 and {{immediately}} places a trailing stop sell {{order to sell}} ABC with a $1.00 trailing stop. This sets the stop price to $9.00. After placing the order, ABC does not exceed $10.00 and falls {{to a low of}} $9.01. The <b>trailing</b> <b>stop</b> <b>order</b> is not executed because ABC has not fallen $1.00 from $10.00. Later, the stock rises to a high of $15.00 which resets the stop price to $13.50. It then falls to $13.50 ($1.50 (10%) from its high of $15.00) and the trailing stop sell order is entered as a market order.|$|E
40|$|In {{financial}} markets traders often protect their position from a significant decline {{by using a}} <b>trailing</b> <b>stop.</b> Assume the trader is long the market (owns the security). A <b>trailing</b> <b>stop</b> is an <b>order</b> to sell the security at the market, {{if the price of}} the security drops to the stop price. The stop price is always less than the market price when the stop is entered. As the price fluctuates, the stop is raised to remain a fixed distance from the maximum price at which the security trades. In this paper we consider two models for the price process: a discrete time random walk and continuous time Brownian motion, both with positive drift. For these price processes we compute the distribution, mean, and variance of the gain to the trader as well as the duration of the trade when a <b>trailing</b> <b>stop</b> strategy is used. Also discussed is the question of optimizing the distance from the current price to the stop.

40|$|<b>Trailing</b> <b>stop</b> is {{a popular}} stop-loss trading {{strategy}} by which the investor will sell the asset once its price experiences a pre-specified percentage drawdown. In this paper, we study the problem of timing buy and then sell an asset subject to a <b>trailing</b> <b>stop.</b> Under a general linear diffusion framework, we study an optimal double stopping problem with a random path-dependent maturity. Specifically, we first derive the optimal liquidation strategy prior to a given <b>trailing</b> <b>stop,</b> and prove the optimality of using a sell limit order {{in conjunction with the}} <b>trailing</b> <b>stop.</b> Our analytic results for the liquidation problem is then used to solve for the optimal strategy to acquire the asset and simultaneously initiate the <b>trailing</b> <b>stop.</b> The method of solution also lends itself to an efficient numerical method for computing the the optimal acquisition and liquidation regions. For illustration, we implement an example and conduct a sensitivity analysis under the exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model. Comment: 4 figures, 26 page...|$|R

5000|$|Short term trading can be {{very risky}} and {{unpredictable}} due to the volatile nature {{of the stock market}} at times. Within the time frame of a day and a week many factors can have a major effect on a stock's price. Company news, reports, and consumer’s attitudes can all have a positive or negative effect on the stock going up or down. According to Zweig (2006), “In an article in a women’s magazine many years ago we advised the readers to buy their stocks as they bought their groceries, not as they bought their perfume” (p. 8). This means doing the research to spot the best opportunities and leaving the emotion and outside appeal out of the decision to buy or sell. Simply watching the news or reading financial statements will not prepare one to have success in the short term. By the time news comes out the markets have already responded and most of the potential gains for investors are gone. Buying or selling a stock that does not have much volume can move it up or down. Small investors have little effect but large mutual funds and hedge funds can determine the minute-to-minute pricing of stocks through supply and demand (Cramer, 2005, p. 96). [...] Watching whether a stock is trending up or down can be a sure sign as to sell or buy in the short run. This is called the moving average or the average price of a stock over a specific period of time. As a stock is trending upward throughout a day or two it could be an opportunity for gains and as a stock trends downward it could be a great opportunity to short the stock. Many analysts use chart patterns in an attempt to forecast the market. Formulas and market theories have been developed to conquer short term trading. According to Masteika and Rutkauskas (2012), when viewing a stock's chart pattern over a few days, the investor should buy shortly after the highest chart bar and then place a <b>trailing</b> <b>stop</b> <b>order</b> which lets profits run and cuts losses in response to market price changes (p. 917-918). [...] Historically, on average the stock markets lowest weekday is Mondays which offers a potential sale on any given stock (Lynch, 2000). [...] Along with that, since 1950 most of the stock market's gains have occurred from November to April. Investor’s can use these known trends and averages to their advantage when trading. [...] Because short term trading {{can be very}} risky for small investors it has been advised by many professionals to limit short term trading and lean more towards value investing or buying and holding a position for the long term. According to Israelov and Katz (2011, p. 34), “Our suggestion (for long term investors) is to use short-term information for trade modification.” This strategy has the value investor reviewing his stocks balance sheets, market signals, and charts every couple months in order to buy more or sell. Trading in the short run is viewed as one of two things: gambling or the possibility of strategic investing.|$|E
