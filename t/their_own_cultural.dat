25|$|The sinicization of the Lingnan {{region was}} largely {{complete}} {{by the time}} of late Southern Song Dynasty (12th to 13th century). During 15th to 18th century, Lingnan (especially the area around Guangzhou) served as one of the main ports for the Ming Empire. Cantonese people were exposed to Western European cultures and incorporated European elements into <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>cultural</b> artifacts. It was by that time when Lingnan culture has largely attained its current form.|$|E

Aventinus' account did not just establish a claim to Gambrivius, but to a glorious ancestry and heritage. The myths also reimagined Gambrivius {{as a catalyst for}} the enlargement of the territory of a Germanic people (the Gambrivii), and made him a divine conduit into Germania for the Egyptians' ancient beer lore.|$|E

The suppression by Russia retarded the literary development of the Ukrainian language in Dnipro Ukraine, {{but there was a}} constant exchange with Halychyna, and many works were published under Austria and smuggled to the east.|$|E

25|$|Indigenous communities, peoples, {{and nations}} are those that, having a {{historical}} continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from {{other sectors of}} the societies now prevailing in those territories, or parts of them.

25|$|The {{experiences}} {{children go}} through {{during times of}} armed conflict can impede their ability to learn in an educational setting. Schools experience drop-outs of refugee and immigrant students from an array of factors such as: rejection by peers, low self-esteem, antisocial behavior, negative perceptions of their academic ability, and lack of support from school staff and parents. Because refugees come from various regions globally with <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>cultural,</b> religious, linguistic, and home practices, the new school culture can conflict with the home culture, causing tension between the student and their family.|$|E
25|$|While {{the arrival}} of Europeans had a {{profound}} impact on the Māori way of life, many aspects of traditional society have survived into the 21st century. Māori participate fully in all spheres of New Zealand culture and society, leading largely Western lifestyles while also maintaining <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>cultural</b> and social customs. The traditional social strata of rangatira, tūtūā and mōkai have all but disappeared from Māori society, while the roles of tohunga and kaumātua are still present. Traditional kinship ties are also actively maintained, and the whānau in particular remains an integral part of Māori life.|$|E

25|$|In 1892 Alberta {{adopted the}} Ontario schools model, {{emphasizing}} state-run institutions that glorified {{not only the}} English language but English history and customs as well. Predominantly francophone communities in Alberta maintained some control of local schools by electing trustees sympathetic to French language and culture. Such groups as the Association Canadienne-Française de l'Alberta expected trustees to implement <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>cultural</b> agenda. An additional problem francophone communities faced was the constant shortage of qualified francophone teachers during 1908-35; {{the majority of those}} hired left their positions after only a few years of service. After 1940 school consolidation largely ignored the language and culture issues of francophones.|$|E
25|$|The {{substrate}} of Angolan {{culture is}} African, predominantly Bantu, while Portuguese culture {{has had a}} significant impact, specifically in terms of language and religion. The diverse ethnic communities – the Ovimbundu, Ambundu, Bakongo, Chokwe, Mbunda and other peoples – to varying degrees maintain <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>cultural</b> traits, traditions and languages, but in the cities, where {{slightly more than half}} of the population now lives, a mixed culture has been emerging since colonial times; in Luanda, since its foundation in the 16th century. In this urban culture, the Portuguese heritage has become more and more dominant. African roots are evident in music and dance, and is moulding the way in which Portuguese is spoken. This process is well reflected in contemporary Angolan literature, especially in the works of Angolan authors.|$|E

40|$|Prosocial {{concepts}} and behavior are often {{found to be}} activated when participants are primed with concepts of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> religious <b>cultural</b> tradition. We investigated whether similar effects can be found when people (Westerners of Christian tradition) are primed with concepts of a different from <b>their</b> <b>own</b> religious <b>cultural</b> tradition (Buddhist and Islamic). Participants (104 young Belgian adults) {{were randomly assigned to}} three conditions. They were supraliminally primed with either Buddhist or Islamic images; or they were not primed (control condition). Priming Buddhism increased prosocial intentions (spontaneous sharing of hypothetical gains), and decreased, among participants highly valuing universalism, implicit prejudice toward an ethnic outgroup. Priming Islam had no effect on prosociality or prejudice. The findings suggest that concepts from one religious and cultural context are transposable, under some conditions, to another religious and cultural context and can influence even implicit social cognition...|$|R
25|$|Although Boas {{was making}} a very {{specific}} contribution to the methods of descriptive linguistics, his ultimate point is far reaching: observer bias need not be personal, it can be cultural. In other words, the perceptual categories of Western researchers may systematically cause a Westerner to misperceive or to fail to perceive entirely a meaningful element in another culture. As in his critique of Otis Mason's museum displays, Boas demonstrated that {{what appeared to be}} evidence of cultural evolution was really the consequence of unscientific methods, and a reflection of Westerners' beliefs about <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>cultural</b> superiority. This point provides the methodological foundation for Boas's cultural relativism: elements of a culture are meaningful in that culture's terms, even if they may be meaningless (or take on a radically different meaning) in another culture.|$|E
25|$|Greek Marseille {{eventually}} became a centre of culture which drew some Roman parents {{to send their children}} there to be educated. According to earlier views, a purported hellenization of Southern France prior to the Roman Conquest of Transalpine Gaul is thought to have been largely due to the influence of Massalia. However, more recent scholarship has shown that the idea of Hellenization was illusory (and that the concept itself is seriously flawed). The power and cultural influence of Massalia have been called into question by demonstrating the limited territorial control of the city and showing the distinctive cultures of indigenous societies. Local Gauls were not Grecophiles who wanted to imitate Greek culture, but peoples who selectively consumed a very limited range of Greek objects (mostly wine and drinking ceramics) that they incorporated into <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>cultural</b> practices according to their own systems of value.|$|E
25|$|Early {{signs of}} the rebirth of civilization in western Europe {{began to appear in}} the 11th century as trade started again in Italy, leading to the {{economic}} and cultural growth of independent city-states such as Venice and Florence; at the same time, nation-states began to take form in places such as France, England, Spain, and Portugal, although the process of their formation (usually marked by rivalry between the monarchy, the aristocratic feudal lords and the church) actually took several centuries. These new nation-states began writing in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>cultural</b> vernaculars, instead of the traditional Latin. Notable figures of this movement would include Dante Alighieri and Christine de Pizan (born Christina da Pizzano), the former writing in Italian, and the latter, although an Italian (Venice), relocated to France, writing in French. (See Reconquista for the latter two countries.) Elsewhere, the Holy Roman Empire, essentially based in Germany and Italy, further fragmented into a myriad of feudal principalities or small city states, whose subjection to the emperor was only formal.|$|E

From February to May 1999, [...] "Shorty" [...] Bertelmann navigated Makali‘i to Satawal in a voyage known as [...] "E Mau [...] Sailing the Master Home".

Makali‘i continued her 1999 voyage through half the length of Micronesia.

2500|$|The first {{decades after}} the Liberation were marked by a {{considerable}} inward turn. The Reformed Churches (Liberated) shunned outside contacts. They formed <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>cultural,</b> societal and political organisations. In these early years, there was a powerful radical wing that supported {{the view that the}} Liberated churches were the [...] "only true Church" [...] in the Netherlands. This view led in part to the schism of 1967, when a group that formed the Netherlands Reformed Churches broke away. The [...] "only true Church" [...] movement soon waned in influence, though it remained in existence until the start of the 21st century. By the 1990s, serious attempts to connect with like-minded orthodox churches were being made. Currently there are close contacts with the Christian Reformed Churches and the Netherlands Reformed Churches, at the local level even including a few complete mergers and many close collaborations.|$|E
