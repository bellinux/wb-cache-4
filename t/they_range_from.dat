5|$|Apart {{from the}} obvious colour {{differences}} between crested and marbled newts, {{species in the}} genus also have different body forms. <b>They</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> stocky with sturdy limbs in the Anatolian, Balkan and the southern crested newt {{as well as the}} marbled newts, to very slender with short legs in the Danube crested newt. These types were first noted by herpetologist Willy Wolterstorff, who used the ratio of forelimb length to distance between fore- and hindlimbs to distinguish subspecies of the crested newt (now full species); this index however sometimes leads to misidentifications. The number of rib-bearing vertebrae in the skeleton was shown to be a better species indicator. It ranges from 12 in the marbled newts to 16–17 in the Danube crested newt and is usually observed through radiography on dead or sedated specimens.|$|E

5|$|Termites {{construct}} shelter tubes, {{also known}} as earthen tubes or mud tubes, that start from the ground. These shelter tubes {{can be found on}} walls and other structures. Constructed by termites during the night, a time of higher humidity, these tubes provide protection to termites from potential predators, especially ants. Shelter tubes also provide high humidity and darkness and allow workers to collect food sources that cannot be accessed in any other way. These passageways are made from soil and faeces and are normally brown in colour. The size of these shelter tubes depends on the amount of food sources that are available. <b>They</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> less than 1cm to several cm in width, but may extend dozens of metres in length.|$|E

Greater Manchester has seven prehistoric monuments (i.e. Bronze or Iron Age), found in Bury, Oldham, Salford, Stockport, and Tameside. The Bronze Age sites are mainly cairns and barrows, and both the Iron Age sites are military in nature, promontory forts.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} non-historical Byzantine sources is vast: <b>they</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> papyri to sermons (most notable those of Sophronius and Anastasius Sinaita), poetry (especially that of Sophronius and George of Pisidia) {{including}} the Acritic songs, correspondence often of a patristic provenance, apologetical treatises, apocalypses, hagiography, military manuals (in particular the Strategikon of Maurice {{from the beginning}} of the 7th century), and other non-literary sources, such as epigraphy, archeology, and numismatics.

5|$|Tigers once ranged widely across eastern Eurasia, {{from the}} Black Sea in the west, to the Indian Ocean in the south, and from Kolyma to Sumatra in the east. Over the past 100 years, {{they have lost}} 93% of their {{historic}} range, and have been extirpated from Western and Central Asia, from the islands of Java and Bali, and from large areas of Southeast, Southern, and Eastern Asia. Today, <b>they</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> the Siberian taiga to open grasslands and tropical mangrove swamps. The remaining six tiger subspecies have been classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The global population in the wild is estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 individuals, down from around 100,000 {{at the start of}} the 20th century, with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other, in which about 2,000 tigers live on the Indian subcontinent. A 2016 global census estimated the population of wild tigers at approximately 3,890 individuals. Major reasons for population decline include habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. The extent of area occupied by tigers is estimated at less than , a 41% decline from the area estimated in the mid-1990s. In 2016, the WWF declared that the world's count of wild tigers has risen for the first time in a century.|$|E
