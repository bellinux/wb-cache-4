40|$|BackgroundIn 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention {{modified}} its 2008 {{protocol for}} flight-related tuberculosis contact investigation initiation. The 2011 Modified protocol was implemented and replaced the 2008 CDC protocol based on comparative epidemiologic and economic analyses; this publication reports the economic analysis results. MethodsA {{return on investment}} model compared relative changes in tuberculosis disease treatment costs resulting from expenditures on <b>tuberculosis</b> contact investigations <b>and</b> latent <b>tuberculosis</b> infection treatment for the 2008 CDC and Modified protocols. ResultsAt moderate/high rates of latent <b>tuberculosis</b> infection <b>and</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> disease, positive returns on investment indicated each $ 1. 00 spent on <b>tuberculosis</b> contact investigations <b>and</b> latent <b>tuberculosis</b> treatment resulted in more than $ 1. 00 of savings from reduced tuberculosis disease treatment costs. Low rates of latent <b>tuberculosis</b> infection <b>and</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> disease resulted in negative returns on investment, indicating economic losses from tuberculosis disease treatment costs. There were smaller economic losses at low latent <b>tuberculosis</b> infection <b>and</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> disease rates with the Modified protocol {{in comparison to the}} 2008 CDC protocol, while both identified comparable numbers of persons at risk for tuberculosis. ConclusionThe Modified protocol for conducting flight-related tuberculosis contact investigations represents a better use of resources and protects public health.

Its portrayal of vampirism {{as a disease}} of contagious demonic possession, with its undertones of sex, blood and death, struck a chord in Victorian Europe where <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>and</b> syphilis were common. The vampiric traits described in Stoker's work merged with and dominated folkloric tradition, eventually evolving into the modern fictional vampire.|$|E

5|$|After {{qualifying}} as a barrister, {{he moved}} to Birmingham in 1914, choosing the city because he had some connections there thanks to his association with Cadbury, and began work at the chambers of John Hurst. His career was aided by the outbreak of World War I; many of the younger and fitter barristers were called up for war service, whilst Birkett himself, who was thirty {{when he joined the}} bar, avoided conscription as he was declared medically unfit.

After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital.
