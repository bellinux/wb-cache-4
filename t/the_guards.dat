5|$|According to the {{accounts}} of some of <b>the</b> <b>guards,</b> {{there may have been}} an opportunity for one or more of <b>the</b> <b>guards</b> to rescue a survivor. Yurovsky demanded that <b>the</b> <b>guards</b> come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the assassinations. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in the basement, and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies.|$|E
5|$|Too weak {{to stand}} or walk, Beauchamp was loaded onto a cart to be {{conveyed}} to the gallows.

5|$|Anyone {{attempting}} {{to cross the}} control strips would leave footprints, which were quickly detected by patrols. This enabled <b>the</b> <b>guards</b> to identify otherwise undetected escape attempts, recording how many individuals had crossed, where escape attempts were being made and at which times of day escapees were active. From this information, <b>the</b> <b>guards</b> were able to determine where and when patrols needed to be increased, where improved surveillance from watchtowers and bunkers was required, and which areas needed additional fortifications.|$|E

For the majority of <b>the</b> time, they <b>guarded</b> <b>the</b> fortified villages {{that had been set}} up to protect the Kikuyu from the Mau Mau. In the early period of <b>the</b> <b>Guard,</b> it was common for the Mau Mau to overrun these fortified positions because <b>the</b> <b>Guard</b> lacked sufficient firepower to resist their attackers. In due course, as <b>the</b> <b>Guard</b> demonstrated its political and military reliability, the Kenya Government supplied shotguns and rifles to <b>the</b> <b>Guard.</b>|$|R
25|$|Following the {{inspection}} of <b>the</b> new <b>guard,</b> <b>the</b> old <b>guard</b> is inspected. After this inspection, the sergeants of <b>the</b> <b>guard</b> and division seconds-in-command are ordered to 'take post' â€“ the sergeant of <b>the</b> <b>guard</b> marches from <b>the</b> right flank to directly behind <b>the</b> <b>guard,</b> while <b>the</b> second-in-command marches {{from the left}} flank to the right. The parade is then called to the present arms for the marching on of the regimental colours.

5|$|In August, Judy met Leading Aircraftman Frank Williams, who adopted her {{and shared}} his daily handful of rice.

She was the only animal to have been officially registered as {{a prisoner of war}} during the Second World War, after Frank William's intervention to protect the dog from <b>the</b> <b>guards,</b> who would often threaten to shoot Judy as the dog growled and barked at them. Williams managed to convince the camp Commandant, who was drunk on sake, to sign the registration papers with the promise of one of Judy's future puppies. Judy's official prisoner-of-war name was '81A Gloergoer Medan'.|$|E
5|$|Lamason then {{instructed}} the group not {{to trust the}} SS, or provoke {{them in any way}} because as they had experienced on the train, <b>the</b> <b>guards</b> were unpredictable and trigger-happy. Also, they were not to explore the camp because of the chance of breaking unknown rules, but to stay together and keep as far away from <b>the</b> <b>guards</b> as possible. He further stated that acting on the group's behalf, he would make further contact with the camp authorities for recognition of their rights.|$|E
5|$|Multiple escape {{attempts}} were made {{throughout the history of}} the prison camp, but the majority ended in failure. In one attempt, foursoldiers were recaptured by the Japanese. <b>The</b> <b>guards</b> forced all prisoners to watch as the foursoldiers were beaten, forced to dig their own graves and then executed. Shortly thereafter, <b>the</b> <b>guards</b> put up signs declaring that if other escape {{attempts were}} made, tenprisoners would be executed for every escapee. Prisoners' living quarters were then divided into groups of ten, which motivated the POWs to {{keep a close eye on}} others to prevent them from making escape attempts.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>guarded</b> {{command is}} <b>the</b> most {{important}} element of <b>the</b> <b>guarded</b> command language. In a guarded command, just as the name says, the command is [...] "guarded". <b>The</b> <b>guard</b> is a proposition, which must be true before the statement is executed. At the start of that statement's execution, one may assume <b>the</b> <b>guard</b> to be true. Also, if <b>the</b> <b>guard</b> is false, <b>the</b> statement will not be executed. <b>The</b> use of <b>guarded</b> commands {{makes it easier to}} prove the program meets the specification.

40|$|Historians and {{military}} officials often consider <b>the</b> National <b>Guard</b> as <b>the</b> direct descendent {{of the colonial}} militia, and the transition {{between the two is}} described as natural. However, <b>the</b> <b>Guard</b> was not <b>the</b> only option available to replace the militia, and many Washington officials and prominent civilians supported European style replacements based on universal military training for all able bodied men. <b>The</b> National <b>Guard</b> maintained a successful lobby and Congress redefined and solidified <b>the</b> new National <b>Guard</b> system with a series of laws during the first two decades of the twentieth century. However, detractors continued to attack the new system and <b>the</b> <b>Guard</b> needed to prove its value. Mexican border duty and service in the First World War provided <b>the</b> <b>Guard</b> with this opportunity. <b>The</b> training <b>the</b> <b>Guard</b> received at <b>the</b> border provided <b>the</b> <b>Guard</b> with <b>the</b> skills necessary to perform in the trenches in France, and <b>the</b> <b>Guard</b> performed better than anticipated.

This Minister was responsible for securing and patrolling the walls, towers, and gates of the imperial palaces. The duties of his ministry were carried out by prefects, one of whom controlled the gates where nominees for office were received and officials sent memorials to the throne. To control and monitor the flow of traffic through the palace gates, the prefects used a complex passport system involving wooden and metal tallies. During an emergency, the tallies were collected and no-one was allowed to enter unless they breached the gates by force. <b>The</b> <b>guards</b> were conscripted peasants who served for a year's term as soldiers and were invited to attend a celebratory feast hosted by the emperor before demobilization.|$|E

5|$|As American forces {{continued}} to approach Luzon, the Japanese Imperial High Command ordered that all able-bodied POWs be transported to Japan.

On January6, 1945, all of <b>the</b> <b>guards</b> {{withdrew from the}} Cabanatuan camp, leaving the POWs alone. <b>The</b> <b>guards</b> had previously told prisoner leaders {{that they should not}} attempt to escape, or else they would be killed. When <b>the</b> <b>guards</b> left, the prisoners heeded the threat, fearing that the Japanese were waiting near the camp and would use the attempted escape as an excuse to execute them all. Instead, the prisoners went to the guards' side of the camp and ransacked the Japanese buildings for supplies and large amounts of food. Prisoners were alone for several weeks, except when retreating Japanese forces would periodically stay in the camp. The soldiers mainly ignored the POWs, except to ask for food. Although aware of the consequences, the prisoners sent a small group outside the prison's gates to bring in twocarabaos to slaughter. The meat from the animals, along with the food secured from the Japanese side of the camp, helped many of the POWs to regain their strength, weight, and stamina. In mid-January, a large group of Japanese troops entered the camp and returned the prisoners to their side of the camp. The prisoners, fueled by rumors, speculated that they would soon be executed by the Japanese.|$|E
