5|$|An {{analysis}} of <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> of comets with nearly parabolic orbits identifies five new comets with hyperbolic orbits that approach the nominal orbit of Planet Nine described in Batygin and Brown's initial paper. If these orbits are hyperbolic due to close encounters with Planet Nine the analysis estimates that Planet Nine is currently near aphelion with a right ascension of 83°–90° and a declination of 8°–10°. Scott Sheppard, who is skeptical of this analysis, notes that many different forces influence <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> of comets.|$|E

5|$|In 1596, Johannes Kepler {{predicted}} “Between Mars and Jupiter, I place a planet” in his Mysterium Cosmographicum. While analyzing Tycho Brahe's data, Kepler {{thought that}} there was too large a gap between <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> of Mars and Jupiter.|$|E
50|$|When e = 0, <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> is circular. Increasing e {{causes the}} circle to flatten into an ellipse.

The skull roof of T. transylvanicus is large and bulbous, preserving a large, flat scute on top, and no osteoderms behind <b>the</b> <b>orbits.</b> Another species, S. austriacus, is known from two incomplete skulls, which preserved irregular scutes parallel to <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> along the cranium.|$|E
5|$|In 499 CE, the Indian {{astronomer}} Aryabhata propounded {{a planetary}} model that explicitly incorporated Earth's rotation about its axis, which he explains {{as the cause}} of what appears to be an apparent westward motion of the stars.

5|$|Kepler's laws of {{planetary}} motion describe <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> of objects about the Sun. Following Kepler's laws, each object travels along an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. Objects {{closer to the}} Sun (with smaller semi-major axes) travel more quickly {{because they are more}} affected by the Sun's gravity. On an elliptical orbit, a body's distance from the Sun varies over the course of its year. A body's closest approach to the Sun is called its perihelion, whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its aphelion. <b>The</b> <b>orbits</b> of the planets are nearly circular, but many comets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits. The positions of the bodies in the Solar System can be predicted using numerical models.|$|E

40|$|Orbit {{correction}} {{is a vital}} procedure at {{particle accelerators}} around <b>the</b> world. <b>The</b> <b>orbit</b> correction routine currently used at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) is a bit cumbersome and a new Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been developed using MATLAB. The correction algorithm uses a singular value decomposition method for calculating the required corrector magnet changes for correcting <b>the</b> <b>orbit.</b> <b>The</b> application has been successfully tested at the ALS. The GUI display provided important information regarding <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> including <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> errors before and after correction, the amount of corrector magnet strength change, and the standard deviation of <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> error {{with respect to the}} number of singular values used. The use of more singular values resulted in better correction of <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> error but at the expense of enormous corrector magnet strength changes. The results showed an inverse relationship between the peak-to-peak values of <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> error and <b>the</b> number of singular values used. The GUI interface helps the ALS physicists and operators understand the specifi c behavior of <b>the</b> <b>orbit.</b> <b>The</b> application is convenient to use and is a substantial improvement over <b>the</b> previous <b>orbit</b> correction routine in terms of user friendliness and compactness...|$|R

5|$|Mike Brown {{counters}} {{these claims}} by saying that, far from not having cleared their orbits, the major planets completely control <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> {{of the other}} bodies within their orbital zone. Jupiter may coexist {{with a large number}} of small bodies in its orbit (the Trojan asteroids), but these bodies only exist in Jupiter's orbit because they are in the sway of the planet's huge gravity. Similarly, Pluto may cross the orbit of Neptune, but Neptune long ago locked Pluto and its attendant Kuiper belt objects, called plutinos, into a 3:2 resonance, i.e., they orbit the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits. <b>The</b> <b>orbits</b> of these objects are entirely dictated by Neptune's gravity, and thus, Neptune is gravitationally dominant.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{computer}} simulations show the Kuiper belt {{to have been}} strongly influenced by Jupiter and Neptune, and also suggest that neither Uranus nor Neptune could have formed in their present positions, because too little primordial matter existed at that range to produce objects of such high mass. Instead, these planets are estimated to have formed closer to Jupiter. Scattering of planetesimals early in the Solar System's history would have led to migration of <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> of the giant planets: Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune drifted outwards, whereas Jupiter drifted inwards. Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> shifted {{to the point where}} Jupiter and Saturn reached an exact 1:2 resonance; Jupiter orbited the Sun twice for every one Saturn orbit. The gravitational repercussions of such a resonance ultimately destabilized <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> of Uranus and Neptune, causing them to be scattered outward onto high-eccentricity orbits that crossed the primordial planetesimal disc. While Neptune's orbit was highly eccentric, its mean-motion resonances overlapped and <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> of the planetesimals evolved chaotically, allowing planetesimals to wander outward as far as Neptune's 1:2 resonance to form a dynamically cold belt of low-inclination objects. Later, after its eccentricity decreased, Neptune's orbit expanded outward toward its current position. Many planetesimals were captured into and remain in resonances during this migration, others evolved onto higher-inclination and lower-eccentricity orbits and escaped from the resonances onto stable orbits. Many more planetesimals were scattered inward, with small fractions being captured as Jupiter trojans, as irregular satellites orbiting the giant planets, and as outer belt asteroids. The remainder were scattered outward again by Jupiter and in most cases ejected from the Solar System reducing the primordial Kuiper belt population by 99% or more.|$|E
5|$|Numerical {{studies have}} shown that over {{millions}} of years, the general nature of the alignment between <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> of Pluto and Neptune does not change. There are several other resonances and interactions that enhance Pluto's stability. These arise principally from two additional mechanisms (besides the 2:3 mean-motion resonance).|$|E
