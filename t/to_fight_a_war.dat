5|$|John {{had lost}} most of his ancestral lands in France to King Philip II in 1204 and had {{struggled}} to regain them for many years, raising extensive taxes on the barons to accumulate money <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> which ended in expensive failure in 1214. Following the defeat of his allies at the Battle of Bouvines, John had to sue for peace and pay compensation. John was already personally unpopular {{with many of the}} barons, many of whom owed money to the Crown, and little trust existed between the two sides. A triumph would have strengthened his position, but in the face of his defeat, within a few months after his return from France John found that rebel barons in the north and east of England were organising resistance to his rule.|$|E
5|$|Many battles were fought from January to July 1499, {{and in all}} but a few minor skirmishes, the {{experienced}} Swiss soldiers defeated the Swabian and Habsburg armies. After their victories in the Burgundian Wars, the Swiss had battle tested troops and commanders. On the Swabian side, distrust between the knights and their foot soldiers, disagreements amongst the military leadership, and a general reluctance <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> that even the Swabian counts considered to be more {{in the interests of the}} powerful Habsburgs than in the interest of the Holy Roman Empire proved fatal handicaps. When his military high commander fell in the battle of Dornach, where the Swiss won a final decisive victory, king Maximilian I had no choice but to agree to a peace treaty signed on September 22, 1499 in Basel. The treaty granted the Confederacy far-reaching independence from the empire. Although the Eidgenossenschaft officially remained a part of the empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, the peace of Basel exempted it from the imperial jurisdiction and imperial taxes and thus de facto acknowledged it as a separate political entity.|$|E
25|$|Port Arthur, on the Liaodong Peninsula in {{the south}} of Manchuria, had been {{fortified}} into a major naval base by the Russian Imperial Army. Since it needed to control the sea in order <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> on the Asian mainland, Japan's first military objective was to neutralize the Russian fleet at Port Arthur.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the mujahideen}} funnelled arms and {{money into the}} country which Bosnia direly needed due to a United Nations-sanctioned arms embargo restricting the import of weapons into all of the republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. However, many of the mujahideen were {{extremely}} devout Muslims of the strict Salafi sect, which contrasted sharply with the widely renowned secular society and liberal attitude Bosnian Muslims harbored. This led to friction between the mujahideen and the Bosnians. Furthermore, some mujahideen wanted <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> of extermination, or use Bosnian territory {{as a base for}} terrorist operations elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Set {{sixty years}} after The Fallen Lords, the game {{tells the story}} of the {{resurgence}} of Soulblighter, a supporting antagonist in the first game, and one of the titular Fallen Lords. Determined to defeat the forces of Light who vanquished his master, Balor, and conquer the free cities of the world, Soulblighter resurrects the Myrkridia, a race of flesh eating monsters not seen in over a thousand years. Standing against Soulblighter is Alric, the main protagonist in the first game, and now King of The Province, who must rally humanity <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> they never expected. Chimera is set ten years after Soulblighter, and {{tells the story of}} three veterans of the campaign against Soulblighter, who band together to fight a mysterious sorceress.|$|E
25|$|The {{draft of}} the L-program was in essence an update of the data {{collected}} for the Commander-in-Chief a year earlier. The S-program, that emerged {{now for the first}} time, was described as a program to develop the knowledge about nuclear weapons which required the creation of Swedish defensive doctrine without nuclear weapons, which would be adopted <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> in which a nuclear strike could occur. Despite a completely different description of the purpose, the S-program included similar activities as the L-program, except it was stripped-down to around 75% of the cost. The S-program fit both the Chief's goal to acquire nuclear weapons and the Social Democratic Government's ambivalence, which the FOA under its new chief director, Martin Fehrm, had apparently realized. Thus, with such a proposition, the Government could fund almost all research activities necessary to pursue the Swedish nuclear weapons program, yet it asserted not to do so.|$|E

His brother Jamie, now cured of madness, was a key ally and Brian tried to cajole Psylocke into joining as well. Relations with his sister deteriorated as the Corps tried to put her teammate Fantomex on trial for murdering a child Apocalypse, arguing that {{it was still a}} crime to kill a child for what they may become. Ironically, in the end it turned out the Goat was a future version of Jamie who had been turned evil and Betsy, who had been forced to sacrifice her emotions to win in battle, stopped the villain by killing the contemporary Jamie; she then berated Brian for leaving the choice to her. He was left bitter by the loss and estranged from his sister.|$|E
25|$|Within the army, {{organisation}} {{and theory}} had no obvious link with war planning and responsibilities overlapped. The General Staff devised deployment plans and its chief became de facto Commander-in-Chief if war began but in peace, command was vested in the commanders of the twenty army corps districts. These commanders were {{independent of the}} General Staff Chief and trained soldiers {{according to their own}} devices. The German system of government was federal and the ministries of war of the constituent states controlled the forming and equipping of units, command and promotions. The system was inherently competitive and became more so after the Waldersee period, when the possibility increased of another Volkskrieg, a war of the nation in arms, rather than the few European wars fought by small professional armies, that had occurred after 1815. Schlieffen concentrated on matters he could influence and pressed for increases {{in the size of the}} army and the adoption of new weapons. A big army would create more choices about how <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> and better weapons would make the army more formidable. Mobile heavy artillery could help make up for numerical inferiority against a Franco-Russian coalition and smash fortifications. Schlieffen tried to make the army more operationally capable so that it was better than its potential enemies and rapidly could win a decisive victory.|$|E
500|$|In 1876 {{hostilities}} {{broke out}} with the Bapedi people under Sekhukhune. Burgers had told the Acting President Piet Joubert not <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> in his absence, so the Transvaal government did little to combat the Bapedi raids. On his return Burgers resolved to send a commando against Sekhukhune; he called on Kruger to lead the column, but much to his surprise the erstwhile Commandant-General refused. Burgers unsuccessfully asked Joubert to head the commando, then approached Kruger twice more, but to no avail. Kruger was convinced that God would cause any military expedition organised by Burgers to fail—particularly if the President rode with the commando, which {{he was determined to}} do. [...] "I cannot lead the commando if you come", Kruger said, [...] "for, with your merry evenings in laager and your Sunday dances, the enemy will even shoot me behind the wall; for God's blessing will not rest on your expedition." [...] Burgers, who had no military experience, led the commando himself after several other prospective generals rebuffed him. After being routed by Sekhukhune, he hired a group of [...] "volunteers" [...] under the German Conrad von Schlickmann to defend the country, paying for this by levying a special tax. The war ended, but Burgers became extremely unpopular among his electorate.|$|E

2500|$|While the British suffragettes stopped their protests when Britain {{entered the}} war in 1914, and {{supported}} the British war effort, Paul remained committed to the suffrage cause and continued her campaign after the US entered the war on April 6, 1917. [...] Members of the NWP argued it was hypocritical for the United States <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> for democracy in Europe while denying its benefits to half of the US population. [...] Similar arguments were being made in Europe, {{where most of the}} allied nations of Europe had enfranchised some women or would soon.|$|E
2500|$|Grant's {{campaign}} {{objective was}} not the Confederate capital of Richmond, but the destruction of Lee's army. Lincoln had long advocated this strategy for his generals, recognizing that the city would certainly fall after the loss of its principal defensive army. Grant ordered Meade, [...] "Wherever Lee goes, there you will go also." [...] Although he hoped for a quick, decisive battle, Grant was prepared <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> of attrition. Both Union and Confederate casualties could be high, but the Union had far greater resources to replace lost soldiers and equipment.|$|E

2500|$|The mountainous {{kingdom of}} Paro and the coastal {{city-state}} of Itha {{had been at}} peace for over a century. They would have remained that way but for the ambitions of Paro's power-hungry king. Paro invaded Itha, despite the love between Jill, Paro's prince, and Ahanas, Itha's princess. [...] Caught between duty and emotion, the star-crossed lovers were forced <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> to its bitter conclusion. Meanwhile, Isu was a simple farmer from the neutral village of Saki, but he saved Itha from being destroyed by a spy from Paro, and found himself hungering for wealth and glory that the Ithan monarchy couldn't provide. Agents from Paro made him an offer to fulfill his wishes, and he left his wife Marin behind in what would turn into a battlefield between the two kingdoms.|$|E
2500|$|Schell's film debut {{was in the}} German anti-war film Kinder, Mütter und ein General (Children, Mothers, and a General, 1955).

[...] The film co-starred Klaus Kinski as an officer, with Schell playing the part of an officer-deserter. The story, which according to one critic, [...] "depicts the insanity of continuing <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> that is lost," [...] would become a [...] "trademark" [...] for many of Schell's future roles: [...] "Schell's sensitivity in his portrayal of a young deserter disillusioned with fighting became a trademark of his acting." ...|$|E

The differences in construction were determined by doctrine that was largely driven by the different approaches to the same tactical problem: How to destroy the enemy's aircraft carriers while surviving the inevitable counter strike.

2500|$|In his war {{contingency}} plans from [...] Schlieffen faced the difficulty that the French {{could not be}} forced to fight a decisive battle quickly enough, to enable German forces to be transferred to the east against the Russians, so as <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> on two fronts one-front-at-a-time. Forcing the French from their frontier fortifications, would be a slow and costly process that Schlieffen preferred to avoid, by a flanking movement through Luxembourg and Belgium. In 1893, this was judged impractical {{because of a lack of}} manpower and mobile heavy artillery. In 1899, Schlieffen added the manoeuvre to German war plans as a possibility, if the French pursued a defensive strategy because the German army was more powerful and by 1905, after the Russian defeat in Manchuria, Schlieffen judged the army to be formidable enough to make the northern flanking manoeuvre the basis of a war plan against France only.|$|E
2500|$|Brazil, however, was {{unprepared}} <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war.</b> Its {{army was}} disorganized. The troops it used in Uruguay were mostly armed contingents of gauchos and National Guard. While some Brazilian {{accounts of the}} war described their infantry as volunteers (Voluntários da Pátria), other Argentinian revisionist and Paraguayan accounts disparaged the Brazilian infantry as mainly recruited from slaves and the landless (largely black) underclass, who were promised free land for enlisting. The cavalry was formed from the National Guard of Rio Grande do Sul. (Ultimately, {{a total of about}} 146,000 Brazilians fought from 1864 to 1870, consisting of 10,025 army soldiers stationed in Uruguayan territory in 1864, 2,047 that were in the province of Mato Grosso, 55,985 Fatherland Volunteers, 60,009 National Guards, 8,570 ex-slaves who had been freed to be sent to war, and 9,177 navy personnel. Another 18,000 National Guard troops stayed behind to defend Brazilian territory.) ...|$|E
