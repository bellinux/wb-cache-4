5|$|From a {{technical}} standpoint, Kanō combined the throwing {{techniques of the}} Kitō-ryū and the choking and pinning techniques of the Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{basically}} {{analyzes the}} reflection that Heidegger made about <b>the</b> <b>technique.</b> It analyzes <b>the</b> ontological perspective of that reflection and also stipulates in which sense Heidegger considered {{that the problem}} of <b>the</b> <b>technique,</b> or more precisely, the question about <b>the</b> <b>technique,</b> is an ontological inquire and not a technical one. Considering what was stated before hand, it analyzes what Heidegger called the essence of <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> that, as a matter of fact, is nothing technical. Finally, it does an analysis about the sense of remitting the reflection about <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> to <b>the</b> being in the philosophy of Heidegger...|$|R
5|$|A leat {{from this}} stretch was created at {{around the time}} of the {{construction}} of the canal to provide water for the Twyford Mead water meadows. Farming of the water meadows continued until around 1930, after the closure of the navigation itself. It was a labour-intensive method of land management, but the controlled flooding of the meadows, with the deposition of silt from the water, enabled the land to produce two crops of hay per year, as well as grazing for sheep and cattle. Demonstrations of <b>the</b> <b>techniques</b> used to flood the meadows are still carried out occasionally.|$|E

5|$|In aikido, as in {{virtually}} all Japanese martial arts, there are both physical and mental aspects of training. The physical training in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and conditioning, as well as specific techniques. Because {{a substantial portion of}} any aikido curriculum consists of throws, beginners learn how to safely fall or roll. The specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; <b>the</b> <b>techniques</b> for defense consist of throws and pins. After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and techniques with weapons.|$|E
5|$|In {{quantum field}} theory, one {{typically}} computes the probabilities of various physical events using <b>the</b> <b>techniques</b> of perturbation theory. Developed by Richard Feynman {{and others in}} the first half of the twentieth century, perturbative quantum field theory uses special diagrams called Feynman diagrams to organize computations. One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of point-like particles and their interactions. Although this formalism is extremely useful for making predictions, these predictions are only possible when the strength of the interactions, the coupling constant, is small enough to reliably describe the theory as being close to a theory without interactions.|$|E

30|$|This {{technique}} {{has a number}} of benefits over the alternatives of sensing technologies and direct measurements. <b>The</b> <b>technique</b> only needs one known value before use; this is the distance between the landmarks. Since it is a requirement of <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> that these landmarks are not moved, this value will not need to be re-measured. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> can be performed relatively quickly once this measurement is obtained in comparison to measuring the locations of the interfaces directly. This ability to be performed quickly without the need for repeated, time consuming measurements makes <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> suitable for any scenarios where the interfaces may be moved regularly, such as educational environments. Because of this <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> can be deemed Quick.|$|R
