40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tilting</b> Lock is an {{innovative}} solution for locations where road traffic crosses marine traffic overhead by a bridge. The occurrence of traffic jams at a bridge during {{the passage of}} vessels can be reduced by {{the construction of a}} Tilting Lock. By 'submerging' the vessels in <b>the</b> <b>Tilting</b> Lock underneath <b>the</b> bridge, <b>the</b> <b>Tilting</b> Lock increases <b>the</b> available air draft for vessels. Due to <b>the</b> <b>Tilting</b> Lock, vessels can pass a fixed bridge span underneath without hindrance for the road traffic on top of the bridge. The main challenge of <b>the</b> <b>Tilting</b> Lock is <b>the</b> large depth that is required for the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>Tilting</b> Lock. Due to the circular shape of <b>the</b> <b>Tilting</b> Lock, excavations are required up to 30 meter below the current bottom surface of the Haringvliet estuary.

5|$|Jupiter's {{radio and}} {{particle}} emissions are strongly modulated by its rotation, {{which makes the}} planet somewhat similar to a pulsar.

5|$|Scientists {{analyzing}} the unique cracks lining Europa found evidence showing that it likely spun around a tilted axis {{at some point}} in time. If correct, this would explain many of Europa's features. Europa's immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. The reason is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt also could affect the estimates of the age of Europa's ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa's ocean liquid, and a tilt in the spin axis means that more heat is generated by tidal forces. This heat helps the ocean to remain liquid longer. Scientists did not specify when <b>the</b> <b>tilt</b> would have occurred and measurements have not been made of <b>the</b> <b>tilt</b> of Europa's axis.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> relatively large <b>tilting</b> angle of AgNRs, we also find {{the influence of}} substrate temperature on <b>the</b> <b>tilting</b> angle.

30|$|From (20), it can {{be found}} that <b>the</b> optimal <b>tilting</b> angle is a {{function}} of the positions of the LED and the PD. In this paper, the position of the LED (i.e., [u,v,w]) is fixed, but the position of the PD (i.e., [a,b,c]) is variable. Therefore, to realize <b>the</b> angle <b>tilting</b> of <b>the</b> receiver plane, the first step is to determine the position of the PD. With an arbitrary tilting angle larger than zero, <b>the</b> <b>tilted</b> receiver can obtain its position by using the three-dimensional positioning method proposed in our previous work [25]. After obtaining the position of the PD, <b>the</b> optimal <b>tilting</b> angle for <b>the</b> receiver can be calculated by using (20).

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the study was to evaluate, using finite element analysis, the stress {{patterns}} induced in cortical bone by three distinct implant-supported prosthetic designs. Materials and Methods: The first two models consisted of a prosthesis supported by four implants, the distal two of which were tilted, with different cantilever lengths (5 mm and 15 mm). The third design consisted of a prosthesis supported by five conventionally placed implants and a 15 -mm cantilever. Results: In <b>the</b> <b>tilted</b> model with 5 -mm cantilever and in the nontilted model, the maximum value of compressive stress (- 18 Mpa) was found near the cervical area of the distal implant. Higher values for compressive stress were predicted near the cervical area of the distal implant in <b>the</b> <b>tilted</b> model with a 15 -mm cantilever, as compared to <b>the</b> <b>tilted</b> model with <b>the</b> 5 -mm cantilever. For <b>the</b> <b>tilted</b> model with <b>the</b> 5 -mm cantilever, peak values of tensile stress were predicted near the cervical area of both the distal (1. 25 Mpa) and the mesial implants (2. 5 Mpa). For the nontilted model, the peak value was found near the cervical area of the in-between implant (5 Mpa). For <b>the</b> <b>tilted</b> model with 15 -mm cantilever, tensile stress values were higher than in <b>the</b> <b>tilted</b> model with 5 -mm cantilever. Conclusions: No significant difference in stress patterns between <b>the</b> <b>tilted</b> 5 -mm and the nontilted 15 -mm configuration was predicted. <b>The</b> <b>tilted</b> configuration with a 15 -mm cantilever was found to induce higher stress values than <b>the</b> <b>tilted</b> configuration with a 5 -mm cantilever.

5|$|The Fizeau {{interferometer}} {{is shown}} {{as it might}} be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting <b>the</b> <b>tilt,</b> which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes, so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, the American League {{decided to}} adopt the {{designated}} hitter rule. On April 6, opening the season at Fenway Park, Ron Blomberg of the Yankees became the first designated hitter in Major League history. Red Sox pitcher Luis Tiant walked Blomberg in his first plate appearance of the game. Later that year at Fenway Park, with the score tied 2–2 {{in the top of}} the ninth, Yankees catcher Thurman Munson attempted to score from third base on a missed bunt by Gene Michael. He crashed into Red Sox catcher Carlton Fisk resulting in a fight with Munson punching Fisk in the face. The rivalry intensified in the 1970s with the fans too, as just a year later in 1974 at Fenway Park, Yankees first baseman Chris Chambliss was struck in the right arm with a dart thrown from the stands after hitting an RBI ground-rule double. Two years later, Yankee outfielder Lou Piniella would crash into Fisk feet first in an attempt to score in the sixth inning of a game at Yankee Stadium. The two benches cleared while Piniella and Fisk brawled at home plate. After the fight apparently died down and order appeared to be restored, Sox pitcher Bill Lee and Yankee third baseman Graig Nettles and center fielder Mickey Rivers began to exchange words, resulting in another fight. Lee suffered a separated left shoulder from <b>the</b> <b>tilt</b> and missed the next 51 games of the 1976 season. He would continue to pitch until 1982. The 1976 season saw the Yankees win the pennant, but lose to the Big Red Machine in the 1976 World Series, just like the Red Sox had done a year prior in the 1975 World Series in which Carlton Fisk hit his famous home run off of the left field foul pole at Fenway Park.|$|E

25|$|Changes in {{the orbital}} {{eccentricity}} of Earth occur on {{a cycle of}} about 100,000 years. The inclination, or tilt, of Earth's axis varies periodically between 22° and 24.5°. (<b>The</b> <b>tilt</b> of Earth's axis {{is responsible for the}} seasons; the greater <b>the</b> <b>tilt,</b> the greater the contrast between summer and winter temperatures.) Changes in <b>the</b> <b>tilt</b> occur in a cycle 41,000 years long. Precession of the equinoxes, or wobbles on Earth's spin axis, complete every 26,000 years. According to the Milankovitch theory, these factors cause a periodic cooling of Earth, with the coldest part in the cycle occurring about every 40,000 years. The main effect of the Milankovitch cycles is to change the contrast between the seasons, not the amount of solar heat Earth receives. These cycles within cycles predict that during maximum glacial advances, winter and summer temperatures are lower. The result is less ice melting than accumulating, and glaciers build up.|$|E
