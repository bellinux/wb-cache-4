5|$|After {{more than}} 60 years of {{continuous}} operation, the Cacchio family {{decided to sell}} <b>the</b> <b>Theatre.</b> Rather than sell to real estate developers, the Cacchios preferred to transfer the property to the Rosendale Theatre Collective, a nonprofit formed in late 2009 {{for the sole purpose}} of buying and preserving <b>the</b> <b>Theatre.</b> The group spent months raising funds for a down payment on the building, with the bulk of its money coming from small individual donations. About 60 fundraisers were held, and a large grant was provided by PepsiCo after <b>the</b> <b>Theatre</b> Collective ran a successful social networking campaign for the April 2010 Pepsi Refresh Project. The Cacchios transferred ownership of the property to <b>the</b> <b>Theatre</b> Collective on August19, 2010.

5|$|The Actor Rebellion of 1733 was {{an event}} that took place at <b>the</b> <b>Theatre</b> Royal, Drury Lane in London, England when the actors who worked there, disapproving {{of the changes in}} the management, {{attempted}} to seize control. Before the rebellion, <b>the</b> <b>theatre</b> was controlled by the managers Theophilus Cibber, John Ellys, and John Highmore. When Theophilus lost his share and was denied a bid to run <b>the</b> <b>theatre,</b> he, along with other actors, attempted to take over <b>the</b> <b>theatre</b> by controlling the lease. When the shareholders found out, they refused to admit the actors to the building and <b>the</b> <b>theatre</b> was closed for several months. The fight spilled over to the contemporary newspapers, which generally sided with the managers.|$|E

5|$|A trial, {{in which}} the rebellious actors sued the {{management}} at the King's Bench over the management's occupation of the building that the actors controlled the lease, was held on 12 November. The judgment under Chief Justice Philip Yorke was in favour of the actors, and {{they were to be}} granted control of <b>the</b> <b>theatre</b> building in March 1734. Highmore, in response, asked for a charge against John Harper, one of the rebellious actors, for being a vagrant, and Harper was sent to Bridewell Palace prison. This provoked a negative reaction by the public, and the action was attacked in the Daily Post of 16 November. Eventually, a writ of habeas corpus was issued on 20 November and he was released without a case tried against him. Having no other recourse, Highmore began to negotiate the sale of <b>the</b> <b>theatre</b> license. Charles Fleetwood purchased both Highmore and Wilks's portions of the license on 24 January 1734. On 2 February, the Daily Courant announced that Fleetwood asked for the rebellious actors to return. An agreement was reached for higher wages and promotion of Theophilus to a deputy manager of <b>the</b> <b>theatre.</b> The actors took control of <b>the</b> <b>Theatre</b> Royal on 8 March 1734, marking the end of the rebellion.|$|E

5|$|According to Simon Goldhill, the {{evidence}} is fundamentally inconclusive.

5|$|Between the 1810s and 1850s {{there were}} a series of changes in {{ownership}} and management.
