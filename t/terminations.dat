5|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of Zobel network filters {{is that they}} have a constant resistance image impedance and for this reason are also known as constant resistance networks. Clearly, the Zobel network filter does not have a problem matching to its <b>terminations</b> and this is its main advantage. However, other filter types have steeper transfer functions and sharper cut-offs. In filtering applications, the main role of Zobel networks is as equalisation filters. Zobel networks are in a different group from other image filters. The constant resistance means that when used in combination with other image filter sections the same problem of matching arises as with end <b>terminations.</b> Zobel networks also suffer the disadvantage of using far more components than other equivalent image sections.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{dependency}} pair {{approach is}} one of the most powerful techniques for automated (innermost) <b>termination</b> proofs of term rewrite systems (TRSs). For any TRS, it generates inequality constraints that have to be satisfied by well-founded orders. However, proving innermost <b>termination</b> is considerably easier than <b>termination,</b> since the constraints for innermost <b>termination</b> are a subset of those for <b>termination.</b> We show that surprisingly, the dependency pair approach for <b>termination</b> can be improved by only generating the same constraints as for innermost <b>termination.</b> In other words, proving full <b>termination</b> becomes virtually as easy as proving innermost <b>termination.</b> Our results are based on splitting the <b>termination</b> proof into several modular independent subproofs. We implemented our contributions in the automated <b>termination</b> prover AProVE and evaluated them on large collections of examples. These experiments show that our improvements increase the power and efficiency of automated <b>termination</b> proving substantially. ...|$|R

5|$|The insertion-loss {{method of}} {{designing}} filters is, in essence, to prescribe a desired function of frequency for the filter as an attenuation {{of the signal}} when the filter is inserted between the <b>terminations</b> relative to the level {{that would have been}} received were the <b>terminations</b> connected to each other via an ideal transformer perfectly matching them. Versions of this theory are due to Sidney Darlington, Wilhelm Cauer and others all working more or less independently and is often taken as synonymous with network synthesis. Butterworth's filter implementation is, in those terms, an insertion-loss filter, but it is a relatively trivial one mathematically since the active amplifiers used by Butterworth ensured that each stage individually worked into a resistive load. Butterworth's filter becomes a non-trivial example when it is implemented entirely with passive components. An even earlier filter which influenced the insertion-loss method was Norton's dual-band filter where the input of two filters are connected in parallel and designed so that the combined input presents a constant resistance. Norton's design method, together with Cauer's canonical LC networks and Darlington's theorem that only LC components were required {{in the body of the}} filter resulted in the insertion-loss method. However, ladder topology proved to be more practical than Cauer's canonical forms.|$|E
5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty {{that he was trying to}} overcome was that the image impedance techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive <b>terminations</b> in the pass-band.|$|E

The sudden growth in mobile telephony market revealed regulatory needs in particular services. The crucial service that regulators mainly focus was Mobile <b>Termination</b> service since it was identified that operators have monopoly power in <b>termination</b> service. By this identification, a debate on whether mobile <b>termination</b> rates need to be regulated arose. This master thesis exemines the debate in detail. Some argue that mobile <b>termination</b> rates are high and high <b>termination</b> rates may cause some market failures. To understand whether mobile <b>termination</b> rates are high, the incentives of the mobile operator: are discussed. Mobile operators have different incentives to set high <b>termination</b> charges for fixed-to-mobile (FTM) and mobile-to-mobile (MTM) calls. Therefore, it is plausible to examine <b>termination</b> issue separately in FTM and MTM markets. The thesis illustrates that while FTM <b>termination</b> rates need to the regulated since incentives are strong, MTM <b>termination</b> charges {{are less likely to be}} regulated. However, <b>termination</b> charges are high not only for FTM, but they are also high for MTM in many countries. Therefore, countries regulate <b>termination</b> rates in both FTM and MTM markets.

A device that is USB2.0 High Speed capable first connects as a Full Speed device (D+ pulled high), but upon receiving a USB RESET (both D+ and D− driven LOW by host for 10 to 20ms) it pulls the D− line high, known as chirp K. This indicates to the host that the device is high bandwidth. If the host/hub is also HS capable, it chirps (returns alternating J and K states on D− and D+ lines) letting the device know that the hub operates at high bandwidth. The device has to receive at least three sets of KJ chirps before it changes to high bandwidth <b>terminations</b> and begins high bandwidth signaling. Because USB 3.0 uses wiring separate and additional to that used by USB2.0 and USB1.x, such bandwidth negotiation is not required.|$|E

40|$|It is broadly {{accepted}} that mobile network operators are monopolists when {{they set the}} <b>termination</b> rate for the calls made to their own network. Since the mobile-to-fixed <b>termination</b> rates are usually regulated at cost and the fixed network operator has the obligation to terminate the incoming calls, therefore the fixed provider can neither threaten to raise the mobile-to-fixed <b>termination</b> charge, nor threaten to refuse to terminate the call.
