5|$|The delegates couldn't {{agree on}} whether the {{executive}} should be a single person, or a board of three. Many wished to limit {{the power of the}} executive and thus supported the proposal to divide the executive power between three persons. The possible problems of this system, in addition to the knowledge that George Washington would probably be the first president, calmed the fears enough so that <b>the</b> <b>proponents</b> of a singular executive could accumulate a large coalition. This issue came up occasionally after the matter was settled, but was never again seriously doubted.|$|E

But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in <b>the</b> <b>proponents</b> of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E

5|$|In February 1952, Baxter became deputy-director of the university. He {{defeated}} Arthur Denning in {{an election}} for director in December, assuming the position on 1 January 1953. As Denning had argued for the retention of the university's links with the Public Service Board, it was widely seen as a victory for <b>the</b> <b>proponents</b> of autonomy, but with his industrial background Baxter had {{little in common with}} the professors who came from academia, and did not share their views on the role and organisation of a university. The university did receive autonomy on 1 July 1954, and when traditional university titles were adopted in 1955, Baxter became vice-chancellor.|$|E
5|$|The {{municipal}} council voted on 17 February 2011 {{to purchase the}} stadium. The strongest proponents were the Labour Party and the Conservative Party, while three parties, the Progress Party, the Liberal Party and Red Party, voted against. <b>The</b> <b>proponents</b> argued that municipality was purchasing the venue with a much higher value than what they had sold, while the opponents {{argued that it was}} not the municipality's responsibility to give financial first-aid to a professional sports club. The cost was NOK16 million, paid for by taking over debt. After taking over the stadium company, the municipality merged it with Bodø Spektrum, which runs an indoor sports complex, including Nordlandshallen. This allows the debt to be taken over by the municipality without interfering with the municipal accounts.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{helicopters}} destroyed or damaged during the operation shocked <b>the</b> <b>proponents</b> of U.S. Army aviation and prompted a reevaluation of basic airmobile doctrine. The 101st Airborne Division alone, for example, had 84 of its aircraft destroyed and another 430 damaged. Combined U.S./ARVN helicopter losses totaled 168 destroyed and 618 damaged. During Lam Son 719 American helicopters had flown more than 160,000 sorties and 19 U.S. Army aviators had been killed, 59 were wounded, and 11 were missing at its conclusion. South Vietnamese helicopters had flown an additional 5,500 missions. U.S. Air Force tactical aircraft had flown more than 8,000 sorties during the incursion and had dropped 20,000 tons of bombs and napalm. B-52 bombers had flown another 1,358 sorties and dropped 32,000 tons of ordnance. Seven U.S. fixed-wing aircraft {{were shot down}} over southern Laos: six from the Air Force (two dead/two missing) and one from the Navy (one aviator killed).|$|E

5|$|As Rana Bahadur Shah's {{bodyguard}} and advisor, Bhimsen Thapa also {{accompanied him}} to Varanasi. Rana Bahadur's retinue included his first wife, Raj Rajeshwari Devi, while his second wife, Subarna Prabha Devi, stayed back in Kathmandu {{to serve as}} the regent. Since Rana Bahadur was willing to do anything to regain his power and punish those who had forced him to exile, he served as a focal point of dissidenting factions in Varanasi. In November 1800, he first sought help from the British in exchange for which he was willing to concede a trading post in Kathmandu and grant them 37.5% of the tax revenue derived from the hills and 50% from the terai. However, the British were in favor of working with the existing government in Nepal, rather than risk the uncertainties of restoring an exiled ex-King to power. The Kathmandu Durbar was willing to appease the British and agreed to sign a commercial treaty so long as the wayward Rana Bahadur and his group were held in India under strict British surveillance. This arrangement was kept a secret from Rana Bahadur and his group; but when they eventually became aware of the strictures on their movement, and hence the treaty, they were incensed at the British as well as <b>the</b> <b>proponents</b> (Damodar Pande and his faction) of this treaty in Nepal. An intrigue was set in motion with the aim of splitting the unity of courtiers in Kathmandu Durbar and fomenting anti-British feelings. A flurry of letters were exchanged between the ex-King and individual courtiers in which he tried to set them up against Damodar Pande and tried to woo them by promises of high government positions, which they could hold for their entire life, and which could be inherited by their progeny. Baburam Acharya holds Bhimsen responsible for all these schemes, reasoning that Rana Bahadur did not have the mental capacity for such negotiations and intrigues. He contends that Bhimsen was responsible for negotiation with the British as well as responsible for writing letters {{in the name of the}} ex-King, while the ex-King was bidding his time in debauchery.|$|E

40|$|In {{a series}} of publications, 1 Ralph Johnson has {{maintained}} that any discourse worthy of being called an argument contains not just reasons given to support some claim——the illative core of the argument——but replies to objections and alternative positions——the dialectical tier. A written or spoken argument, presented {{in the form of}} a text, should be properly understood as a product of a dialectical procedure, where a proponent puts forward a thesis and answers questions posed by a challenger. Argumentation begins when the challenger questions a statement put forward by <b>the</b> <b>proponent.</b> Given his reply, the challenger may ask further questions, to which <b>the</b> <b>proponent</b> may reply, this procedure possibly continuing through a number of exchanges. The aim of <b>the</b> <b>proponent</b> is to meet these questions of the challenger and ultimately to persuade her of the acceptability of the claim she initially challenged. This is his goal unless, of course, her questions reveal an inadequacy in the defensibility of his claim——at least as he is currently able to carry out that defense. Such a process or procedure would be incomplete, if <b>the</b> <b>proponent</b> left various questions of the challenger unanswered. <b>The</b> <b>proponent</b> would not have met his dialectical obligations (Blair and Johnson 1987, 54).

5000|$|In American jurisprudence, demonstrative {{evidence}}, {{like any}} other kind of evidence must be [...] At this point <b>the</b> <b>proponent</b> of <b>the</b> demonstrative evidence can either try to get the evidence admitted into the official record of the case or can choose to use the evidence as merely a prop. If <b>the</b> <b>proponent</b> of <b>the</b> evidence wants to have the evidence included in the official record of <b>the</b> case, <b>the</b> <b>proponent</b> will first ask for the evidence to be marked by the court for identification purposes. After the evidence is marked for identification, <b>the</b> <b>proponent</b> of <b>the</b> demonstrative evidence must lay a foundation. It is at this time that the relevancy of the demonstrative evidence is usually challenged. Laying of a foundation explains how the demonstrative evidence relates to {{the facts of the case}} and establishes the evidence's authenticity. Once the foundation is laid, <b>the</b> <b>proponent</b> may ask to officially move the piece of evidence into the record where it is marked as a full exhibit. If the evidence is marked as a full exhibit the jury may refer to the evidence during deliberations and in most jurisdictions the jury may examine the evidence during deliberations. If the evidence is not marked as a full exhibit, the jury cannot do these things. As a matter of courtesy, <b>the</b> <b>proponent</b> of <b>the</b> demonstrative evidence generally shows the piece of evidence to the opposing party before marking it for identification purposes. In criminal cases certain kinds of demonstrative evidence are subject to mandatory disclosure under the case law governing discovery. See Brady v. Maryland.|$|R
