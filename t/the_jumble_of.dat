The Company built a series of additional docks and two new timber ponds to the north while rival companies built additional docks, leading to <b>the</b> <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> harbours, canals and timber ponds. In 1865, the company merged with the neighbouring Surrey Docks to form the Surrey Commercial Docks, controlling some 80% of London's timber trade.|$|E
60|$|The {{location}} was high, {{and through a}} break in <b>the</b> <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> rocks the great colored void of desert could be seen rolling away endlessly to the west. The sun set, and after it had gone down the golden tips of mountains dulled, their lower shadows creeping upward.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked around}} the landing on which they stood, at the miserable, uncarpeted floor, the ill-painted doors on which the long-forgotten varnish stood out in blisters, <b>the</b> <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> {{dilapidated}} hot-water cans, a mop, and a medley of brooms and rags all thrown down together in a corner.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>jumbling</b> <b>of</b> French and British {{interests}} in the islands brought petitions for {{one or another of}} the two powers to annex the territory. The Convention of 16 October 1887 established a joint naval commission {{for the sole purpose of}} protecting French and British citizens, but claimed no jurisdiction over internal native affairs.|$|R

60|$|The {{gap between}} Diablo and Sol narrowed yard by yard. At first {{it had been}} a wide one. The raider beat his mount and spurred, beat and spurred, wheeled round to shoot, then bent forward again. In his circle at {{the upper end of the}} valley he turned far short of <b>the</b> <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> rocks.|$|E
6000|$|... "Boys, I'm with you," [...] {{came the}} reply. And {{he was with}} us all the way, as we clambered over the immense blocks and {{threaded}} a passage between them and pulled weary legs up, one after the other. So steep lay <b>the</b> <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> cliff fragments that we {{lost sight of the}} cave long before we got near it. Suddenly we rounded a stone, to halt and gasp at the thing looming before us.|$|E
5000|$|Adema contends in her article: [...] "food {{television}} {{incorporates the}} vicarious pleasures of watching someone else cook and eat; the emulsion of entertainment and cooking; <b>the</b> <b>jumbling</b> <b>of</b> traditional gender roles; and ambivalence toward cultural standards of body, consumption, and health. â€¦ simultaneously perpetuates {{the stress of}} social expectations, and sprinkles sexual innuendos in a venue traditionally associated with maternal security." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>jumbling</b> <b>of</b> French and British {{interests}} in the islands brought petitions for one or other of the two powers to annex the territory. In 1906, France and the United Kingdom agreed to administer the islands jointly. Called the Anglo-French condominium, it was a unique form of government. The separate governmental systems came together only in a joint court. Melanesians were barred from acquiring the citizenship of either power.|$|R
60|$|It afforded him {{great relief}} {{to find that}} Creech's trail turned into a canyon on the left; and here, with the sun already low, Slone began to watch the clumps <b>of</b> cedars and <b>the</b> <b>jumbles</b> <b>of</b> rock. But he was not ambushed. Darkness set in, and, being tired out, {{he was about to}} halt for the night when he caught the flicker of a campfire. The {{stallion}} saw it, too, but did not snort. Slone dismounted and, leading him, went cautiously forward on foot, rifle in hand.|$|R
60|$|We {{climbed out}} of the parks, up onto the rocky ridges where the spruce grew scarce, and then farther to <b>the</b> <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> stones that had {{weathered}} from the great peaks above, and beyond that up the slope where all the vegetation was dwarfed, deformed, and weird, strange manifestation of its struggle for life. Here the air grew keener and cooler, and the light seemed to expand. We rode on to the steep slope that led up to the gap we were to cross between the Dome and its companion.|$|E
60|$|The Estremedura lay rolling gently off {{the quaint}} old Spanish city of Santa Cruz, Teneriffe, {{most of the}} {{following}} day. It was, indeed, {{late in the afternoon}} when she went to sea, and while <b>the</b> <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> white walls and red-tiled roofs faded astern Austin sat in a deck-chair under a lifeboat, while Jacinta, Mrs. Hatherly, and Miss Muriel Gascoyne, to whom he had been duly presented, occupied a seat close by. He was not particularly charmed with the latter's company, and decided that she was certainly as unlike Jacinta as she very well could be.|$|E
60|$|One day, {{as he was}} plodding slowly northward, {{guided by}} the stars, his faith {{in the success of}} his mission began to flag. Hard {{continuous}} toil and a weakening frame had no doubt something to do with his depression. His dogs, also, were in much the same condition with himself,--growing thin, and becoming less lively. Clambering {{to the top of a}} hummock, he surveyed the prospect before him. It was not cheering. The faint daylight of noon was spreading over the frozen sea, bringing the tops of the larger bergs out into bold relief against the steel-blue sky, and covering <b>the</b> <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> lumps and hummocks with a cold grey light.|$|E

60|$|He hung up {{the shafts}} and took the gig-lamp. As he came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{familiar}} <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> shafts and wheels in the shed, the water, in little waves, came washing strongly against his legs. He staggered and almost fell.|$|R

6000|$|... "Ye-e-es," [...] {{repeated}} Jackson. His {{clear blue}} eyes looked about, contemptuous, amused and hard, like {{the eyes of}} a boy. A clumsy string of red, yellow, and green omnibuses rolled swaying, monstrous and gaudy; two shabby children ran across the road; a knot of dirty men with red neckerchiefs round their bare throats lurched along, discussing filthily; a ragged old man with a face of despair yelled horribly in the mud the name of a paper; while far off, amongst the tossing heads of horses, the dull flash of harnesses, <b>the</b> <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> lustrous panels and roofs of carriages, we could see a policeman, helmeted and dark, stretching out a rigid arm at the crossing of the streets.|$|E
6000|$|The [...] "Liberty Girls' Shop" [...] was proving {{a veritable}} mint. Expenses were {{practically}} nothing, {{so all the}} money received could be considered clear profit. It was amusing to observe the people who frequented the shop, critically examining <b>the</b> <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> wares displayed, wondering who had donated this or that and meantime searching for {{something that could be}} secured at a [...] "bargain." [...] Most of the shrewd women had an idea that these young girls would be quite ignorant of values and might mark the articles at prices far below their worth, but the [...] "values" [...] of such goods could only be conjectural, and therefore the judgment of the older women was no more reliable than that of the girls. They might think they were getting bargains, and perhaps were, but that was problematic.|$|E
60|$|And {{then with}} all this {{administrative}} fizzle, this pseudo-scientific administrative chatter, dying away in your head, out you went into the limitless grimy chaos of London streets and squares, roads and avenues lined with teeming houses, each larger than the Chambers Street house and at least equally alive, you saw the chaotic clamour of hoardings, <b>the</b> <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> traffic, the coming and going of mysterious myriads, you heard the rumble of traffic like the noise of a torrent; a vague incessant murmur of cries and voices, wanton crimes and accidents bawled at you from the placards; imperative unaccountable fashions swaggered triumphant in dazzling windows of the shops; and you found yourself swaying back to the opposite conviction that the huge formless spirit of the world it was that held the strings and danced the puppets on the Bailey stage....|$|E
50|$|Nearby {{the ruins}} there {{are said to}} be <b>the</b> <b>jumbled</b> remains <b>of</b> an ancient dovecot, in {{appearance}} more like an ice house. The OS map shows a formal garden to the south of the castle ruins. Rob Close sees similarities with Crosbie Castle, Prestwick.|$|R

60|$|They {{found it}} was not easy to locate that five acres, even with a map, when the two girls made the attempt the next forenoon. But finally, {{at the end of a}} lonely lane about a mile and a half from the village, they came upon a stony tract hemmed in by low hills, which seemed to fit the {{location}} described. The place was one mass of tumbled rocks. Little herbiage of any sort grew there and its low assessment value was easily explained. The surrounding farms, all highly cultivated, backed up to the little waste valley, which was fenced out--or rather in--by the owners of the fertile lands. One faintly trodden path led from the bars of the lane the girls were in toward Mr. Cragg's five acres of stones, but amid <b>the</b> <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> rocks it would be difficult to walk at all.|$|E
6000|$|The loopholes not in {{use were}} plugged rather like old-fashioned hives. Said the Colonel, {{removing}} a plug: [...] "Here are the Boches. Look, and you'll see their sandbags." [...] Through <b>the</b> <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> riven trees and stones one saw {{what might have been}} a bit of green sacking. [...] "They're about seven metres distant just here," [...] the Colonel went on. That was true, too. We entered a little fortalice with a cannon in it, in an embrasure which at that moment struck me as unnecessarily vast, even though it was partly closed by a frail packing-case lid. The Colonel sat him down in front of it, and explained the theory of this sort of redoubt. [...] "By the way," [...] he said to the gunner at last, [...] "can't you find something better than that?" [...] He twitched the lid aside. [...] "I think it's too light. Get a log of wood or something." ...|$|E
60|$|Of course, when I {{thoroughly}} {{understood the}} state of the case, my first impulse was to spring out of bed, and, as quickly as possible, {{to get out of that}} thumping and sliding house. But I restrained myself. The floor might be covered with broken glass, I might not be able to find my clothes in the darkness and in <b>the</b> <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> furniture at the end of the room, and even if I could dress myself, it would be folly to jump out in the midst of that raging storm into a probable mass of wreckage which I could not see. It would be far better to remain dry and warm under my roof. There was no reason whatever to suppose that the house would go to pieces, or that it would turn over. It must stop some time or other, and, until it did so, I would be safer in my bed than anywhere else. Therefore in my bed I stayed.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{promise not}} to make any noise," [...] replied Madeline. Madeline {{arranged}} her coat {{so that she could}} lie upon it, and settled down to wait developments. There came a slight rattling of stones in the rear. She turned to see Helen sliding down a bank with a perplexed and troubled cowboy. Helen came stooping low to where Madeline lay and said: [...] "I am going to see what happens, if I die in the attempt! I can stand it if you can." [...] She was pale and big-eyed. Ambrose promptly swore at the cowboy who had let her get away from him. [...] "Take a half-hitch on her yourself an' see where you end up," [...] replied the fellow, and disappeared in <b>the</b> <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> rocks. Ambrose, finding words useless, sternly and heroically prepared to carry Helen back to the others. He laid hold of her. In a fury, with eyes blazing, Helen whispered: ...|$|E
60|$|Whether the {{weakening}} of her intellect made her more cunning and false than before, or whether it confused her between what she had assumed to be and what she really had been, or whether it had awakened any glimmering of remorse, which could neither struggle into light nor get back into total darkness, or whether, in <b>the</b> <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> her faculties, {{a combination of these}} effects had been shaken up, which is perhaps the more likely supposition, the result was this:--That she became hugely exacting in respect of Edith's affection and gratitude and attention to her; highly laudatory of herself as a most inestimable parent; and very jealous of having any rival in Edith's regard. Further, in place of remembering that compact made between them for an avoidance of the subject, she constantly alluded to her daughter's marriage as a proof of her being an incomparable mother; and all this, with the weakness and peevishness of such a state, always serving for a sarcastic commentary on her levity and youthfulness.|$|E

Then <b>the</b> <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> sounds, as you pass along the dock, blends in any thing but sweet concord. The sailors are singing boisterous Ethiopian {{songs from the}} Yankee ship just entering; the cooper is hammering at the casks on the quay; the chains of the cranes, loosed of their weight, rattle as they fly up again; the ropes splash in the water; some captain shouts his orders through his hands; a goat bleats from some ship in the basin; and empty casks roll along the stones with a hollow, drum-like sound. Here the heavy-laden ships are down far below the quay, and you descend to them by ladders; whilst in another basin they are high {{up out of the}} water, so that their green copper sheathing is almost level with the eye of the passenger; while above his head a long line of bow-sprits stretch far over the quay, and from them hang spars and planks as a gangway to each ship. This immense establishment is worked by from one to three thousand hands, according as the business is either brisk or slack.'" ...|$|E

Idle and keen perceptions guided them equally.|$|R
