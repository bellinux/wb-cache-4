40|$|Text {{recognition}} in video/natural scene images has gained significant {{attention in the}} field of image processing in many computer vision applications, which is much more challenging than {{recognition in}} plain background images. In this paper, we aim <b>to</b> <b>restore</b> complete <b>character</b> contours in video/scene images from gray values, in contrast to the conventional techniques that consider edge images/binary information as inputs for text detection and recognition. We explore and utilize the strengths of zero crossing points given by the Laplacian to identify stroke candidate pixels (SPC). For each SPC pair, we propose new symmetry features based on gradient magnitude and Fourier phase angles to identify probable stroke candidate pairs (PSCP). The same symmetry properties are proposed at the PSCP level to choose seed stroke candidate pairs (SSCP). Finally, an iterative algorithm is proposed for SSCP <b>to</b> <b>restore</b> complete <b>character</b> contours. Experimental results on benchmark databases, namely, the ICDAR family of video and natural scenes, Street View Data, and MSRA data sets, show that the proposed technique outperforms the existing techniques in terms of both quality measures and recognition rate. We also show that character contour restoration is effective for text detection in video and natural scene images...|$|R

50|$|Character {{death in}} an online game usually comes with a penalty (though some games remove it from PvP combat), so {{habitual}} PKers can find themselves ostracized by the local community.

5000|$|The main {{central tower}} of the {{original}} church collapsed in a storm in 1701, destroying the transepts.

This was completed in 1706 under the ministry of Thomas Chest, who was vicar from 1701 to 1740.

2500|$|Feeling {{that too}} much of the Doctor's backstory had been {{revealed}} by the Seventh Doctor's era, writers Andrew Cartmel, Ben Aaronovitch and Marc Platt developed a new direction for the series.

Under Cartmel, the show foreshadowed this concept; however, its 1989 cancellation meant that it was never realised onscreen. The proposed backstory was fully explored in Platt's 1997 novel Lungbarrow, where the Doctor is revealed as [...] "the Other", a mysterious figure in Gallifreyan lore who co-founded Time Lord society with Rassilon and Omega. After a curse renders Gallifrey sterile, the Other devises biotechnological looms to [...] "weave" [...] new Time Lords; his granddaughter Susan is Gallifrey's last natural child. To escape a civil war with Rassilon, the Other throws himself into the loom system, where he is disintegrated and later woven into the Doctor.|$|R

50|$|Congress Street {{was laid}} out in 1855, serving in part as an access to the back sides of large mansion houses facing Wethersfield Avenue, which it {{parallels}} to the east, and whose properties extended {{all the way to}} Congress Street. The west side of Congress Street was developed in the 1850s, benefiting from the growth of the Colt Armory to the east. Prominent residents of the early period included Francis A. Pratt and Amos Whitney, machinists who founded a business now known as Pratt & Whitney Measurement Systems, and whose names grace the more well-known Pratt & Whitney aircraft engine manufacturer. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many of the estates facing Wethersfield Avenue were subdivided or redeveloped, and the apartment blocks facing Congress Street were built.

40|$|H-detected multiple-bond {{correlation}} (HMBC) {{provides an}} extremely effective method for long-range ‘H- 13 C shift correlation (I). The sequence of this experiment is sketched in Fig. 1. In {{the most common}} application, indirect detection of 13 C via ‘H, a J filter (2 {{may be used to}} reject one-bond correlations that could cause over-) crowding of the 2 D spectrum (1). The delay A 2 following the J filter is needed to generate multiple-bond multiple-quantum coherence. Typically, this delay is set to about 60 ms. The dephasing of the ‘H magnetization caused by homonuclear coupling present during this A 2 period causes large phase perturbations in the F 2 dimension and makes the recording of 2 D absorption spectra impossible. In principal, z-filtering procedures (3), purging pulses (4, 5), and bilinear rotations (6, 7) could be used <b>to</b> <b>restore</b> absorption-mode <b>character</b> in the ‘H dimension. In practice, however, the z filters and purge pulses seriously decrease sensitivity; bilinear rotations require a sub-stantial number of ‘H pulses and seriously affect the suppression of the much stronger signals from protons not coupled to 13 C. Regardless, it appears impossible in practice to devise a generally applicable bilinear rotation that refocuses homonuclear ‘H cou...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{restoration}} method for electronic text document images using erasable watermarks. In restoration application, finding {{sufficient number of}} low-distortion pixels in a block to embed sufficient information bits and their blind detection is difficult. In the proposed method, an erasable watermark is embedded in each block of a text document image for restoration of the original character sequence. The embedding process introduces some background noise; however the content in the document can be read or understood by the user, because human vision has the inherent capability to recognize various patterns {{in the presence of}} noise. After verifying the content of each block, the original image can be restored at the blind detector for further use and analysis. Using the proposed method, it is possible <b>to</b> <b>restore</b> the original <b>character</b> sequence after multiple alterations like character deletion, insertion, substitution and block swapping. ...|$|R
5000|$|To {{fulfill the}} game's objective, the player uncovers various {{documents}} that provide exposition about the game's narrative, {{as well as}} clues that help them solve various puzzles within the mansion. Key items are also available that give the player access to other items or new areas. The player can arm their character with weapons to defend themselves from enemies, although the ammunition available for each firearm is limited and the player must learn to conserve the ammunition they have for situations where they will really need it. <b>To</b> <b>restore</b> the <b>character's</b> health, the player uses first-aid sprays or three types of healing herbs that can be mixed together in different combinations for different healing effects. The carrying capacity of the player is limited depending on the character and items that the player {{does not wish to}} carry at the moment can be stored into an item box to be retrieved for later use. To save their progress, the player must pick up an ink ribbon and use it on any of the typewriters scattered through key locations in the game. However, the supply of ink ribbons the player can acquire is limited much like the player's ammo and healing supplies. Players will encounter and fight various infected creatures as flesh-eating zombies, undead dogs, giant spiders, and other monsters.|$|R
