5|$|After co-authoring Volume 17, John Button, with Volume 18, <b>The</b> <b>Twisted</b> Claw (1939), {{took over}} the series {{full-time}} until 1942; McFarlane resumed with Volume 22, The Flickering Torch Mystery (1943). McFarlane's last contribution was Volume 24, The Short-Wave Mystery (1945); his wife, Amy, authored Volume 26, The Phantom Freighter (1947). Over the next several decades, other volumes were written by Adams, Svenson, Lawrence, Buranelli, William Dougherty, and James Buechler. Beginning in 1959, the series was extensively revised and re-written. Many authors worked on the revised books, writing new manuscripts; some of them also wrote plot outlines and edited the books.

5|$|The Danger Tree {{had been}} part of a clump of trees located about halfway into No Man's Land and had {{originally}} been used as a landmark by a Newfoundland Regiment trench raiding party {{in the days before the}} Battle of the Somme. British and German artillery bombardments eventually stripped the tree of leaves and left nothing more than a shattered tree trunk. During the Newfoundland Regiment's infantry assault, the tree was once again used as a landmark, where the troops were ordered to gather. The tree was however a highly visible landmark for the German artillery and the site proved to be a location where the German shrapnel was particularly deadly. As a result, the regiment suffered a large concentration of casualties around the tree. A replica representation of <b>the</b> <b>twisted</b> tree now stands at the spot.|$|E

It was released on April 21, 2013 at the Tribeca Film Festival and then received a very limited release in New York City and Los Angeles in early 2014. She was cast opposite Nicolas Cage in the action-crime feature Rage, which focused on a reformed criminal seeking his own brand of justice after his daughter gets kidnapped. The film premiered through selected theaters and video-on-demand in the U.S. between June and July 2014. The same year, she guest starred in one episode of the Lifetime series Witches of East End and debuted as a recurring character in the short-lived USA Network show Rush.|$|E
5|$|Link, {{who is the}} {{apprentice}} of a blacksmith, goes to deliver a sword to a captain at Hyrule Castle, only to encounter a mysterious figure named Yuga, who transforms a descendant of a Sage, Seres, into a painting. After being knocked out during the fight, Link is found by a merchant named Ravio, who gives him a bracelet in exchange for being allowed to stay in his home, and tells him to report {{what had happened to}} Princess Zelda. After going to Hyrule Castle, Zelda gives Link the Pendant of Courage and instructs him to seek out the pendants of Power and Wisdom in order to gain the power of the Master Sword. Along the way, Link encounters Yuga again and is turned into a painting himself. However, thanks to Ravio's bracelet, Link is protected from Yuga's spell and gains the ability to merge with walls and move around as a painting. After finding the other pendants and obtaining the Master Sword, Link returns to Hyrule Castle where he witnesses Yuga transform Zelda into a painting. Link pursues Yuga through a dimensional crack, arriving in <b>the</b> <b>twisted</b> decaying kingdom of Lorule. There, Yuga uses Zelda and the descendants of the Seven Sages, who he had all trapped inside paintings, to revive Ganon and fuse with him, obtaining the Triforce of Power in the process. Just then, Link is assisted by Princess Hilda, the ruler of Lorule, who traps Yuga in magic bonds.|$|E

5|$|The ride {{begins with}} Evac {{moving out of}} the loading station and making a turn. The vehicle {{approaches}} the first of thirteen 3D high-definition video screens which depicts Ravage grabbing a canister containing the AllSpark. Evac spins 180° to face the second screen on which Bumblebee is fighting Sideways for the AllSpark, which ends up in Evac's possession. Evac reverses into one of two elevator shafts which ascend to the second level of the attraction. During the ascent Optimus Prime battles Megatron and Grindor chases Evac who is furiously heading in reverse until Grindor's arm is broken off by a train. Megatron grabs Evac and the two struggle until Megatron breaks a water pipe, which sprays riders with water. Evac enters a dead end pathway before reversing and turning to face another 3D screen, which shows Megatron firing a missile at Evac while continuing to find Optimus. Hot air and fog generate the illusion of an explosion. Evac then heads through the hole in a building which was caused by the explosion. Inside lies Devastator, who is trying to suck everything out of the building. Ratchet and Ironhide cover fire while Evac reverses and escapes the suction. Here the Autobot Sideswipe helps in the battle against the Decepticon Bonecrusher. Devastator returns to the scene alongside Starscream. Evac escapes from Devastator a second time by going through him, but Starscream grabs Evac and throws him across several city blocks before landing on a construction site and smashing into some drums which release clouds of fog resulting in Evac asking if the riders are okay. Optimus Prime and Megatron continue their battle in the construction site as Evac reverses away in an attempt to protect the AllSpark. Starscream appears for a second time but is chased away by two NEST helicopters. Evac then returns to a second set of two elevators. During the descent to the ground floor, Evac forces the AllSpark into Megatron's chest causing both to freefall to the ground when Megatron grabs Evac. Bumblebee saves Evac from destruction before Optimus Prime congratulates Evac and the riders on their mission. The last thing guests see before disembarking is <b>the</b> <b>twisted</b> wreckage of Megatron stuck in the ceiling near the exit.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>twist</b> is a {{fundamental}} geometric property of nucleic acids. Calculation of <b>the</b> <b>twist</b> in <b>the</b> most general case requires detailed specification of the three-dimensional path of each strand, but many important cases may be analyzed by considering only <b>the</b> <b>twist</b> difference. If C 1, C 2, and C 3 are three distinct space curves, <b>the</b> <b>twist</b> difference about C 1 is defined as Tw(C 3, C 1) - Tw(C 2, C 1). We show here that this difference measures {{the rotation of the}} correspondence surface joining C 1 to C 2 about the correspondence surface joining C 1 to C 3. This result has application to DNA containing local nonuniformities, such as denatured regions, cruciforms, and other altered structures. It also facilitates <b>the</b> calculation of <b>twist</b> for three-stranded structures, including D-loops in mitochondrial DNA and replication and transcription intermediates. <b>The</b> <b>twist</b> difference may also be used to simplify greatly <b>the</b> analysis of <b>twist</b> changes in duplex DNA due to winding on surfaces, such as histones and certain enzymes. In such cases <b>the</b> strand-axis <b>twist</b> of DNA divides into two independent terms. The first term arises from <b>the</b> <b>twist</b> of <b>the</b> local reference frame, and the second arises from the rotation of either strand about the duplex axis as measured in the local reference frame. Twist changes consequent to nucleosome winding, for example, arise from <b>the</b> <b>twist</b> of <b>the</b> nucleosome axis, a straight line, about the DNA axis plus the rotation of either strand of the DNA about its axis in the reference frame of the cylinder...|$|R
