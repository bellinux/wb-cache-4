5|$|In 2016, a {{scientific}} drilling project drilled deep into <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> {{ring of the}} Chicxulub impact crater, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries confirmed that the rock comprising <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> ring had been subjected to immense pressures and forces and had been melted by immense heat and shocked by immense pressure from its usual state into its present form in just minutes; the fact that <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> ring was made of granite was also significant, since granite is not a rock found in sea-floor deposits, it originates much deeper in the earth and had been ejected to the surface by the immense pressures of impact; that gypsum, a sulfate-containing rock that is usually present in the shallow seabed of the region, had been almost entirely removed and must therefore have been almost entirely vaporized and entered the atmosphere, and that the event was immediately followed by a huge megatsunami (a massive movement of sea waters) sufficient to lay down the largest known layer of sand separated by grain size directly above <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> ring.|$|E
