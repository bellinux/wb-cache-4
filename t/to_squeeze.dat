5|$|These units linked {{up several}} times during this war and engaged in several furious battles with the enemy. One such battle {{happened}} during Operation Anaconda the mission <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> life out of a Taliban and Al-Qaeda stronghold dug deep into the Shah-i-Kot mountains of eastern Afghanistan. The operation was seen {{as one of the}} heaviest and bloodiest fights in the War in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters {{spend much}} of their time grooming, which {{consists}} of cleaning the fur, untangling knots, removing loose fur, rubbing the fur <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> out water and introduce air, and blowing air into the fur. To casual observers, it appears as if the animals are scratching, but they are not known to have lice or other parasites in the fur. When eating, sea otters roll in the water frequently, apparently to wash food scraps from their fur.|$|E
5|$|The Schenectady group {{improved}} on the anvils {{designed by}} Percy Bridgman, {{who received a}} Nobel Prize {{for his work in}} 1946. Bundy and Strong made the first improvements, then more were made by Hall. The GE team used tungsten carbide anvils within a hydraulic press <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> the carbonaceous sample held in a catlinite container, the finished grit being squeezed out of the container into a gasket. The team recorded diamond synthesis on one occasion, but the experiment could not be reproduced because of uncertain synthesis conditions, and the diamond was later shown to have been a natural diamond used as a seed.|$|E

50|$|This {{is still}} a simple squeeze, but it is termed an {{automatic}} <b>squeeze</b> <b>to</b> distinguish it from a positional squeeze. The fact that declarer's two threats are in different hands means that no matter which defender holds both stoppers, {{at least one of}} the threats lies in the upper hand (the J if West is <b>to</b> be <b>squeezed,</b> the K if East is <b>to</b> be <b>squeezed).</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{eigenvalue}} {{problem of}} the operator a + zeta(boson creation operator) is solved for arbitrarily complex zeta by applying a nonunitary operator to the vacuum state.

5|$|The {{strategic}} {{purpose of}} controlling Musa Qala is both <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> Taliban operations in south-western Afghanistan {{and to serve}} as a symbol of Afghan National Army and ISAF strength; the town had taken on iconic proportions, according to British officials. The Taliban, however, continue to enjoy significant civilian support despite their atrocities and the broader campaign to win over the region remains difficult. Troop shortages have made it difficult for NATO to hold areas seized from the Taliban in southern Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Winfield Scott, the {{commanding}} {{general of the}} U.S. Army {{at the beginning of}} the war, devised the Anaconda Plan to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible. His idea was that a Union blockade of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy; then the capture of the Mississippi River would split the South. Lincoln adopted the plan in terms of a blockade <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> to death the Confederate economy, but overruled Scott's warnings that his new army was not ready for an offensive operation because public opinion demanded an immediate attack.|$|E
5|$|As a {{token of}} respect, {{prosecutor}} Klavier Gavin, Kristoph's brother and Apollo's rival, invites him and Trucy to attend a concert for his band, the Gavinners. During a guest performance by the diva Lamiroir, her manager Romein LeTouse is shot and killed in her dressing room. When Machi Tobaye, Lamiroir's pianist, is accused for the killing, Apollo, through an extensive investigation, discovers that Machi {{and one of the}} Gavinners, Detective Daryan Crescend, conspired to smuggle contraband into the country, and that Letouse, in reality an undercover Interpol agent, was murdered to cover it up. The case nearly falls apart {{due to a lack of}} decisive evidence, but Apollo is able <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> a confession out of Daryan by threatening to have Machi testify.|$|E
40|$|A {{model of}} the effect of the {{longitudinal}} optical phonon number distribution on the Rabi oscillations of the photons involved in the associated indirect transition in a semiconductor is presented. It is shown that a faster cavity photon revival rate is obtained given an initial squeezed thermal phonon state.

It may be possible to use this effect <b>to</b> detect <b>squeezing</b> in phonons. © 1997 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{complete}} analytical {{description of the}} time evolution of squeezed states of a charged particle under the Fock-Darwin Hamiltonian and a time-dependent electric field. This result generalises a relation obtained by Infeld and Plebański for states of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. We relate {{the evolution of a}} state-vector subjected <b>to</b> <b>squeezing</b> <b>to</b> that of state which is not subjected <b>to</b> <b>squeezing</b> and for which the time-evolution under the simple harmonic oscillator dynamics is known (e. g. an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian). A corresponding relation is also established for the Wigner functions of the states, in view of their utility in the analysis of cold-ion experiments. In an appendix, we compute the response functions of the FD Hamiltonian to an external electric field, using the same techniques as in the main text...|$|R

5|$|Such a {{plan would}} still fail if {{sufficient}} ground {{could not be}} taken quickly in Belgium <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> the allies against two fronts. Preventing this from happening were the defences of Fort Eben-Emael and the Albert Canal. The three bridges over the canal were the key to allowing Army Group B a high operational tempo. The bridges at Veldwezelt, Vroenhoven and Kanne in Belgium, and Maastricht on the Dutch border were the target. Failure to capture the bridges would leave Reichenau's German 6th Army, the southern-most army of Group B, trapped in the Maastricht-Albert Canal enclave and subjected to the fire of Eben-Emael. The fort had to be captured or destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine army {{retreated from}} the Sofia Valley towards Ihtiman where it stopped for the night. The rumours that the Bulgarians had barred the nearby {{mountain}} routes stirred commotion among {{the soldiers and}} {{on the following day}} the retreat continued in growing disorder. When the Bulgarians under Samuil and probably Roman saw that, they rushed to the enemy camp and the retreat turned to flight. The Byzantine advance guard managed <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> through slopes which were not yet taken by the Bulgarian attackers. The rest of the army was surrounded by the Bulgarians. Only the elite Armenian unit from the infantry managed to break out with heavy casualties and to lead their Emperor to safety through secondary routes. Enormous numbers of Byzantine soldiers perished in the battle; the rest were captured along with the Imperial insignia.|$|E
5|$|Charlie Cutter first {{appears in}} Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He {{is a friend}} of Nate's and is also shown to know Elena to some extent when she {{inquires}} about his well-being. It is apparent that he suffers from severe claustrophobia, requiring a lot of prompting just <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> through tight spaces. He is first introduced as one of Marlowe's henchmen, although it is soon apparent that he was an inside man. He helps Nate, Chloe, and Sully {{in the first part of}} the game with finding the clues to the location of Ubar, the Atlantis of the Sands. He gets injured when jumping off a tower in Syria and tells Nate to go on and stop Marlowe out of revenge. Despite looking like a blunt, common thug, he appears to be well educated, quoting John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men and correcting Sully's mistake when quoting Macbeth. He is voiced by and modeled after Graham McTavish, who previously voiced Lazarevic in the second game.|$|E

5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War in 1861 between {{the northern and southern}} states also contributed to the trend. The war disrupted the sale of northern ice to the south, and Maine merchants instead turned to supplying the Union Army, whose forces used ice in their more southern campaigns. James L. Cheeseman had responded to the 1860 ice famine by moving his ice trading business from the Hudson northwards into Maine, bringing with him the latest technology and techniques; Cheeseman went on to win valuable contracts with the Union Army during the war years. Carré ice machines were brought into New Orleans to make up the shortfall in the south, focusing in particular on supplying southern hospitals. In the post-war years, the number of such plants increased, but once competition from the north recommenced, cheaper natural ice initially made it hard for the manufacturers to make a profit. By the late 1870s, however, efficiency improvements were allowing them <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> natural ice out of the marketplace in the south.|$|E
5|$|With only 4:25 {{remaining}} and a lead well in hand, Stanford {{began running}} down the clock by executing running plays, which keep the game clock running {{as long as the}} ball carrier is downed in the field of play. Three rushes gained Stanford 16yards, but the effectiveness of this strategy was undermined by a 15-yard personal foul penalty against Stanford that prevented the Cardinal from gaining a first down. Stanford also accepted a delay of game penalty in order <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> as much time as possible from the clock before punting back to Virginia Tech. The final drive of the game began from the Tech 11-yard line with 2:10 remaining, and quarterback Taylor controlled the ball on all of its five plays. Taylor completed a five-yard pass to Coale, then ran for 18yards and a first down. He was then sacked for a 15-yard loss, but gained much of that back with an 11-yard run. On the game's final play, Taylor completed a 17-yard first-down pass to Wilson, who was tackled as the last second ticked off the clock and Stanford clinched a 40–12 victory.|$|E

40|$|I {{define a}} two-sided or {{forward-backward}} propagator for the pseudo-diffusion equation of the 'squeezed' Q function. This propagator leads <b>to</b> <b>squeezing</b> {{in one of}} the phase-space variables and anti-squeezing in the other.
