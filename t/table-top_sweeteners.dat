Even consumers with high intakes were not exposed to excessive levels, as relative intakes at the 95 th percentile (p 95) were 31 % for acesulfame-K, 13 % for aspartame, 30 % for cyclamate, 17 % for saccharin, and 16 % for sucralose of the respective ADIs. Assessment of intake using the Tier 3 approach was preceded by optimization and validation of an analytical method based on liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. Concentrations of sweeteners in various food matrices and <b>table-top</b> <b>sweeteners</b> were thus determined and mean positive concentration values were included in the Tier 3 approach, leading to relative intakes for p 95 of 17 % for acesulfame-K, 5 % for aspartame, 25 % for cyclamate, 11 % for saccharin, and 7 % for sucralose of the corresponding ADIs. The contribution of <b>table-top</b> <b>sweeteners</b> to the total usual intake (< 1 % of ADI) was demonstrated to be negligible. Comparison of observed intake of the total population with intake of diabetics (acesulfame-K: 3. 55 vs. 3. 75, aspartame: 6. 77 vs. 6. 53, cyclamate: 1. 97 vs. 2. 06, saccharine: 1. 14 vs. 0. 97, and sucralose: 3. 08 vs. 3. 03, expressed as mg kg- 1 bodyweight day- 1 for p 95) showed that the latter group was not exposed to higher levels. It was thus concluded that the Belgian population was not at risk of exceeding the established ADIs for sweeteners...|$|E
40|$|Based on EC {{regulation}} 1333 / 2008, {{each member}} of the European Union is supposed to evaluate the intake of food additives by its population. This project resulted in a demand of the Federal Department of Public Health, Safety of the Food Chain and Environment to the Scientific Institute of Public Health to elaborate a study of <b>table-top</b> <b>sweeteners</b> and the estimation of the total intake of sweeteners by the Belgian population. The use of the selected sweeteners, including acesulfame-K, saccharin, cyclamate, aspartame and sucralose, is regulated by the European directive on sweeteners (94 / 35) and for each substance an acceptable daily intake (ADI; acceptable daily intake) was established (9, 5, 7, 40 and 15 mg per kg body weight). The {{purpose of this study was}} to establish whether the Belgian adult population was at risk of exposure to sweetener levels that exceeded ADI levels by usual intake of sweetened foods and specific consumption of table top sweeteners...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} by the European Commission, the Scientific Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Foods (ANS) carried out an {{assessment}} of the dietary exposure to erythritol and concluded on the safety of the proposed use in beverages at a maximum use level of 2. 5 %, taking into account additional exposure data provided to the Panel. Anticipated exposure to erythritol from its use as food additive including soft-drinks containing a mean concentration of 2. 5 % erythritol would be in the range of 0. 004 - 0. 04 g/kg bw/day for toddlers, 0 - 0. 05 g/kg bw/day for children, 0 - 0. 08 g/kg bw/day for adolescents, 0 - 0. 14 g/kg bw/day for adults, and 0 - 0. 01 g/kg bw/day for the elderly. At high level, exposure estimates would be in the range of 0. 29 - 0. 48 g/kg bw/day (toddlers), 0. 13 - 0. 76 g/kg bw/day (children), 0. 04 - 0. 50 g/kg bw/day (adolescents), 0. 05 - 0. 43 g/kg bw/day (adults), and 0. 01 - 0. 25 g/kg bw/day (the elderly). The main categories contributing to the exposure to erythritol were <b>table-top</b> <b>sweeteners</b> and soft drinks for all age groups except toddlers where soft drinks were the only main contributor. The Panel concluded that based on the new data provided on use levels of erythritol in foods and {{on the basis of the}} extension of the authorisation for the use of erythritol to soft drinks at a use level of 2. 5 % the Margin of Safety of 1. 54 is too low to protect children adequately...|$|E
5000|$|Like most proteins, curculin is {{susceptible}} to heat. At a temperature of 50 C the protein starts to degrade and lose its [...] "sweet-tasting" [...] and [...] "taste-modifying" [...] properties, {{so it is not}} a good candidate for use in hot or processed foods. However, below this temperature both properties of curculin are unaffected in basic and acidic solutions, so it has potential for use in fresh foods and as a <b>table-top</b> <b>sweetener.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Since its {{approval}} by the United States government in 1998 and introduction there in 1999, sucralose has overtaken Equal in the $1.5-billion artificial sweetener market, holding a 62% market share. According to market research firm IRI, Splenda sales were $212 million in 2006 in the U.S. while Equal's totaled $48.7 million. According to a 2012 article in The New Zealand Herald it is [...] "the category leader in <b>table-top</b> <b>sweetener</b> in the US".|$|R
40|$|Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni is {{an ancient}} {{perennial}} shrub of South American used since ancient times for various purposes throughout the world. Stevia extracts contain high levels of sweetening compounds called steviol glycosides which besides sweetening (300 times sweeter than sacarose) possess antioxidant, antimicrobial and antifungal activity. Stevioside and rebaudioside A are the main sweetening compounds of this plant which are thermostable even at temperatures of up to 200 °C, making them suitable for use in cooked foods. Preparations of steviol glycosides are reported to be used principally as sweeteners in fruit and milk-based drinks, desserts, yoghurts, confectioneries, and pickles. The use of Stevia extract as a <b>table-top</b> <b>sweetener</b> is well known. The leaves of Stevia has functional and sensory properties superior to those of many other high-potency sweeteners {{and is likely to}} become a major source of safe and high-potency sweetener for the growing natural food market in the future. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen great {{interest}} concerning the development of artificial sensing devices; most notably optoelectronic tongues and noses. Utilizing previous research on how the mammalian gustatory and olfactory systems operate, significant progress in mimicking these systems has been realized. The turning point in this field of research has been the discovery that the mammalian senses of smell and taste are not based on specific receptors for each stimulant, but rather an array of semi-specific receptors that function simultaneously to produce a pattern. This pattern is interpreted in the brain, and classified either as a known stimulant or a new analyte similar to a known family of tastes or odors. As a predominantly visual species, we are programmed to acknowledge visible reports to chemical reactions over alternative reporting methods. Thus, colorimetric sensing can be more advantageous than other techniques and can allow for {{a greater number of}} chemical reactions to be probed. One colorimetric approach to sensing involves the immobilization of cross-responsive chemosensors capable of showing a color change upon reaction with analytes or mixtures of analytes. The employment of porous glasses as an immobilization technique has allowed for facile detection of analytes, both aqueous and gaseous, by allowing dye-analyte interactions to occur while preventing the sensor dye from escaping from the matrix. In this manner, colorimetric sensor arrays have been fashioned that are capable of discriminating among structurally similar compounds such as sugars, while retaining the ability to detect a wide range of analytes including toxic industrial chemicals. For aqueous detection, the newly developed porous glasses successfully immobilized otherwise soluble dyes that could detect changes in solution pH, caused by boronic acid-diol interactions. This allowed for rapid and sensitive detection and identification of natural and artificial sugars and sweeteners. Further experiments showed the array’s ability to differentiate between a selection of common <b>table-top</b> <b>sweeteners</b> such as Equal®, Sweet’N’Low®, Splenda®, and natural sugars. Gas sensing applications were made possible by slight modifications to the liquid sensing array. Hydrophobic silica precursors were added to limit the effect of changing humidity on the array, and printing onto flat, non-porous polymer surfaces gave fast and easy accessibility of incoming analytes to the immobilized indicators. Stable and sensitive colorimetric arrays for the detection and semi-quantification {{of a large number of}} toxic industrial chemicals was made possible by the inclusion of additional indicators capable of colorimetrically reporting changes in polarity, metal ligation, and redox reactions. The performances of these sensing arrays showed extremely low limits of detection, and were capable of identifying toxic gases within a large range of concentrations; ppb up to concentration immediately dangerous to life and health. In order to improve upon the detection limits for weakly responding gaseous analytes, alternative methods were developed. It was found that the immobilization of simple and stable color-changing dyes within chemically-reactive matrices could allow for facile and sensitive detection and quantification of formaldehyde. Optimization studies were carried out to assess the proper doping level of hydrophilic polymers with amine-appended polyethylene glycol...|$|E
