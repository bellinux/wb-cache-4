5000|$|The {{registration}} of homographic domain names {{is akin to}} <b>typosquatting,</b> in that both forms of attacks use a similar-looking name to a more established domain to fool a user. The major difference is that in <b>typosquatting</b> the perpetrator relies on natural human typos, while in homograph spoofing the perpetrator intentionally deceives the web surfer with visually indistinguishable names. Indeed, {{it would be a}} rare accident for a web user to type, e.g., a Cyrillic letter within an otherwise English word such as [...] "citibank". There are cases in which a registration can be both <b>typosquatting</b> and homograph spoofing; the pairs of l/I, i/j, and 0/O are all both close together on keyboards and bear a certain amount of resemblance to each other.|$|E

5000|$|This {{argument}} is roughly a <b>typosquatting</b> argument, wherein legitimate potential customers seeking Falwell's website might misspell his official domain name and instead go to fallwell.com, giving Lamparello an [...] "unearned audience".

50|$|One of {{the most}} common accusations against domain name {{speculation}} is that it is simply cybersquatting. Cybersquatting is defined as registering, trafficking in, or using a domain name with bad faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else. The key element in this definition is that the intellectual property rights of another's trademark are infringed by the cybersquatter. For a UDRP action to succeed {{one of the things that}} the complainant has to establish is that the domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights. Legitimate domain name speculation tends to steer clear of trademarks and concentrate on generic words and phrases as domains based on trademarks can be subject of UDRP actions by the trademark owners. As the number of registered domain names has increased, the number of UDRP cases has also increased. Trademark and service mark owners now use brand protection services that monitor TLDs for newly registered domains that potentially infringe on their trademarks. This is due in part to <b>typosquatting,</b> a form of cybersquatting where variations of the spelling of a brand's domain will be registered in an attempt to profit from users mistyping the URL of the site they wish to visit.|$|E
40|$|<b>Typosquatting</b> is {{the act of}} purposefully {{registering}} {{a domain}} name that is a mistype of a popular domain name. It {{is a concept that}} has been known and studied for over 15 years, yet still thoroughly practiced up until this day. While previous <b>typosquatting</b> studies have always taken a snapshot of the <b>typosquatting</b> landscape or base their longitudinal results only on domain registration data, we present the first content-based, longitudinal study of <b>typosquatting.</b> We collected data about the <b>typosquatting</b> domains of the 500 most popular sites of the Internet every day, for a period of seven months, and we use this data to establish whether previously discovered <b>typosquatting</b> trends still hold today, and to provide new results and insights in the <b>typosquatting</b> landscape. In particular we reveal that, even though 95 % of the popular domains we investigated are actively targeted by typosquatters, only few trademark owners protect themselves against this practice by proactively registering their own <b>typosquatting</b> domains. We take advantage of the longitudinal aspect of our study to show, among other results, that <b>typosquatting</b> domains change hands from typosquatters to legitimate owners and vice versa, and that typosquatters vary their monetization strategy by hosting different types of pages over time. Our study also reveals that a large fraction of <b>typosquatting</b> domains {{can be traced back to}} a small group of <b>typosquatting</b> page hosters and that certain top-level domains are much more prone to <b>typosquatting</b> than others. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{a method for}} identifying “typosquatting”, the intentional registration of misspellings of popular website addresses. We estimate that at least 938 000 <b>typosquatting</b> domains target the top 3 264. com sites, and we crawl more than 285 000 of these domains to analyze their revenue sources. We find that 80 % are supported by pay-per-click ads, often advertising the correctly spelled domain and its competitors. Another 20 % include static redirection to other sites. We present an automated technique that uncovered 75 otherwise legitimate websites which benefited from direct links from thousands of misspellings of competing websites. Using regression analysis, we find that websites in categories with higher pay-per-click ad prices face more <b>typosquatting</b> registrations, indicating that ad platforms such as Google AdWords exacerbate <b>typosquatting.</b> However, our investigations also confirm the feasibility of significantly reducing <b>typosquatting.</b> We find that <b>typosquatting</b> is highly concentrated: Of typo domains showing Google ads, 63 % use one of five advertising IDs, and some large name servers host <b>typosquatting</b> domains as much as four times as often as the web as a whole. ...|$|E
40|$|Web-fraud {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{unpleasant}} features of today’s Internet. Two eminent examples of web-fraudulent activities are phishing and <b>typosquatting.</b> Phishing aims to elicit sensitive information from users by presenting them with mock-ups of legitimate web sites. <b>Typosquatting</b> is the nefarious practice of fielding web sites with names closely resembling those of legitimate and popular Internet destinations. Effects range from relatively benign (such as unwanted or unexpected ads) to downright sinister (especially, when <b>typosquatting</b> is combined with phishing). Prior work has assessed the risks of phishing and <b>typosquatting</b> and even attempted to profile and mitigate them. However, the problem remains largely unsolved. This paper presents a novel technique to detect web-fraud domains that utilize HTTPS. To achieve this, we conduct the first comprehensive study of SSL certificates for legitimate and popular domains, as opposed to those used for web-fraud. Drawing from extensive measurements, we build a classifier that detects malicious domains with high accuracy. We validate our methodology with large amounts of data collected from the Internet. Our prototype is orthogonal to existing mitigation techniques and can be integrated with other available solutions. Our work shows that, besides its intended benefits of confidentiality and authenticity, the use of HTTPS can help mitigate web-fraud. ...|$|E

40|$|With {{more than}} 294 million {{registered}} domain names {{as of late}} 2015, the domain name ecosystem has evolved to become a cornerstone for {{the operation of the}} Internet. Domain names today serve everyone, from individuals for their online presence to big brands for their business operations. Such ecosystem that facilitated legitimate business and personal uses has also fostered "creative" cases of misuse, including phishing, spam, hit and traffic stealing, online scams, among others. As a first step towards this misuse, the registration of a legitimately-looking domain is often required. For that, domain <b>typosquatting</b> provides a great avenue to cybercriminals to conduct their crimes. In this paper, we review the landscape of domain name <b>typosquatting,</b> highlighting models and advanced techniques for typosquatted domain names generation, models for their monetization, and the existing literature on countermeasures.

Cybersquatting occurs when a party registers a domain name that contains someone else 2 ̆ 7 s trademark and then attempts to profit by selling or licensing the name to that party. Cybersquatting tends to be classified as direct cybersquatting and <b>typosquatting,</b> and actions involving domain name conflicts fall in four categories: 1) trademark infringement, 2) confusion of source, 3) dilution of a famous mark, and 4) bad faith registration. Recognizing the growing issue of cybersquatting, Congress passed the Anitcybersquatting Consumer Protection Act in 1999, which provided a litigious avenue for dispute resolution. Around the same time, ICANN (the assignor of domain names) adopted the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy, which provided an alternative dispute resolution avenue through arbitration. Mr. Ward {{presents a comparison between}} these two options, and concludes that the best method depends on which channel of recourse offers the most benefits at the lowest cost...|$|E
