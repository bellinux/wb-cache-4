25|$|Even {{though he}} {{produced}} a number of pocket timekeepers, from around 1772-1778, Arnold was still experimenting with different types of compensation balance and methods of balance spring adjustment. The most difficult problem to surmount was the problem of making an effective and continuously adjustable <b>temperature</b> <b>compensation</b> device. For technical reasons, the <b>temperature</b> <b>compensation</b> for the balance spring had to somehow {{be incorporated into the}} balance itself and not act on the balance spring directly as had been done previously by Arnold and others.|$|E

40|$|Determining {{the angular}} {{momentum}} <b>compensation</b> <b>temperature</b> of ferrimagnets {{is an important}} step towards ferrimagnetic spintronics, but is not generally easy to achieve it experimentally. We propose a way to estimate the angular momentum <b>compensation</b> <b>temperature</b> of ferrimagnets. We find a linear relation between the <b>compensation</b> <b>temperatures</b> of the magnetization and angular momentum in GdFeCo ferrimagnetic materials, which is proved by theoretically as well as experimentally. The linearity comes from the power-law criticality and is governed by the Curie temperature and the Landé g factors of the elements composing the ferrimagnets. Therefore, measuring the magnetization <b>compensation</b> <b>temperature</b> and the Curie temperature, which are easily assessable experimentally, enables to estimate the angular momentum <b>compensation</b> <b>temperature</b> of ferrimagnets. Our study provides efficient avenues into an exciting world of ferrimagnetic spintronics. Comment: 18 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

25|$|Other early {{productions}} by Arnold from 1768 to 1770 display both originality and ingenuity; {{this includes}} a centre seconds watch wound up by depressing the pendant once a day. The movement of this watch was also fully jewelled with a <b>temperature</b> <b>compensation</b> device and a ruby stone cylinder escapement.|$|E
25|$|This {{surviving}} watch {{dates from}} around 1769-1770, and is signed Arnold No. 1 Invenit et Fecit. The movement, which indicates centre seconds, has a steel balance with a bimetallic <b>temperature</b> <b>compensation</b> strip that acts {{on the flat}} balance spring.

25|$|Mica is {{a natural}} {{material}} and not available in unlimited quantities. So in the mid-1920s the deficiency of mica in Germany and the experience in porcelain—a special class of ceramic—led in Germany to the first capacitors using ceramic as dielectric, founding a new family of ceramic capacitors. Paraelectric titanium dioxide (rutile) {{was used as the}} first ceramic dielectric because it had a linear temperature dependence of capacitance for <b>temperature</b> <b>compensation</b> of resonant circuits and can replace mica capacitors. 1926 these ceramic capacitors were produced in small quantities with increasing quantities in the 1940s. The style of these early ceramics was a disc with metallization on both sides contacted with tinned wires. This style predates the transistor and was used extensively in vacuum-tube equipment (e.g., radio receivers) from about 1930 through the 1950s.|$|E

In addition, Arnold fitted bi-metallic <b>temperature</b> <b>compensation,</b> and not only was every pivot hole jewelled but the escapement also had a stone cylinder made of ruby or sapphire.

2500|$|Around 1900 low-thermal-expansion {{materials}} {{began to}} be used for pendulum rods in the highest precision clocks and other instruments, first invar, a nickel steel alloy, and later fused quartz, which made <b>temperature</b> <b>compensation</b> trivial.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study of}} the changes over magnetics properties observed in multilayers Gd 1 ¡xCox=Co have been done.

2500|$|Around 1900 low thermal {{expansion}} materials were developed which, when used as pendulum rods, made elaborate <b>temperature</b> <b>compensation</b> unnecessary. These were only used in {{a few of the}} highest precision clocks before the pendulum became obsolete as a time standard. In 1896 Charles Édouard Guillaume invented the nickel steel alloy Invar. This has a CTE of around 0.5 µin/(in·°F), resulting in pendulum temperature errors over 71°F of only 1.3 seconds per day, and this residual error could be compensated to zero with a few centimeters of aluminium under the pendulum bob (this {{can be seen in the}} Riefler clock image above). Invar pendulums were first used in 1898 in the Riefler regulator clock [...] which achieved accuracy of 15 milliseconds per day. Suspension springs of Elinvar were used to eliminate temperature variation of the spring's restoring force on the pendulum. Later fused quartz was used which had even lower CTE. These materials are the choice for modern high accuracy pendulums.|$|E
