50|$|Proteinases: The proteinases {{present in}} {{mammalian}} cortical granules primarily serve {{to modify the}} zona pelucida during the zona reaction.

Both the ZP2 proteinase and trypsin-like proteinase contribute to polyspermy prevention. As its name suggests, ZP2 proteinase proteolyzes ZP2 during the zona reaction. <b>Tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> (tPA) is a serine proteinase that transforms plasminogen into its activated form, plasmin.

Initial activation rates of murine and human plasminogen by autologous <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> were comparable (catalytic efficiencies, k 2 /Km, of 0. 4 and 0. 6 mM- 1 s- 1, respectively), but murine plasminogen appeared to be resistant to activation by human <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> (k 2 /Km = 0. 01 mM- 1 s- 1). Plasminogen activation by <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> was stimulated 100 - and 160 -fold in autologous murine and human systems, respectively, with saturating concentrations of 0. 45 and 0. 32 microM, respectively, of CNBr-digested fibrinogen. Nearly quantitative binding (85 - 90 %) of <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> to fibrin was observed both in autologous and heterologous systems. Murine and human plasmin were very rapidly inhibited by autologous and heterologous alpha 2 -antiplasmin (second-order inhibition rate constants, k 1,app, of 2. 1 - 2. 3 x 10 (7) M- 1 s- 1) and murine and human <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> were very rapidly inhibited by autologous or heterologous plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (k 1,app of 1. 8 - 4. 9 x 10 (7) M- 1 s- 1). Two-chain murine <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> (added at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml) was inhibited in normal or plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 -deficient murine plasma with half-lives of 6. 5 min and 4. 2 min, respectively, as compared to 80 min for human <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator,</b> suggesting that murine plasma contains proteinase inhibitors other than plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 which efficiently inhibit autologous <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator.</b> Clot lysis experiments in autologous plasma revealed that the murine plasma fibrinolytic system is more resistant to activation than the human system (20 - 30 % clot lysis in 2 h with 100 nM <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> in the murine system, as compared to 50 % clot lysis in 2 h with 3. 5 nM <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> in the human system).

40|$|Objective: Melioidosis is a {{frequent}} cause of severe sepsis in Southeast Asia caused by the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> during melioidosis. Design: Animal study. Setting: University research laboratory. Subjects: Wild-type and tissue-type plasminogen activator-deficient C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Interventions: Mice were intranasally infected with viable Burkholderia pseudomallei and killed after 24, 48, or 72 hrs for harvesting of lungs, liver, and blood. Additionally, survival studies were performed. Measurements and Main Results: Experimentally induced melioidosis was associated with elevated levels of <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> in lungs of infected wild-type mice. During activator deficient mice were protected when compared to wildtype mice as demonstrated by a strongly decreased mortality (62 % vs. 100 % amongst wild-type mice, p <. 0001), together with decreased pulmonary bacterial loads, less severe histopathological scores, and decreased fibrinolysis.

Objectives: To study the effect of elevation of local plasminogen activator activity during pneumonia caused by the common respiratory pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae. METHODS: Female C 57 Bl/ 6 mice were inoculated intranasally with a replication-defective adenoviral vector expressing human <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> or a control vector 24 h before intranasal infection with K. pneumoniae. RESULTS: Mice infected with Klebsiella via the airways developed overt pneumonia, which was accompanied by a downregulation of pulmonary <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> levels at protein and mRNA levels. Pulmonary overexpression of human <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> resulted in increased fibrinolytic activity in the lungs during pneumonia, as indicated by higher D-dimer levels and reduced fibrin deposition.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Comparison of {{different}} <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activators</b> {{is difficult because}} conventional endpoints such as mortality are relatively insensitive to potential differences in efficacy with respect to rapidity of recanalization of infarct-related arteries. METHODS: This study was performed to determine whether valid comparisons could be made by means of biochemical endpoints that have been demonstrated previously to permit estimation {{of the time of}} opening of an infarct-related artery in experimental animals and in patients. The method is based on time-dependent interconversion of isoforms of creatine kinase mediated by carboxypeptidase N, an enzyme present in excess in circulating blood. A small subset of 39 patients studied in the ASsessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Thrombolytic agent (ASSENT- 2) trial were evaluated to determine the feasibility of using the creatine kinase isoform method for comparison of two <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activators</b> (tPA), recombinant tPA (r-tPA) and TNK-tPA. RESULTS: Early recanalization (within 40 min of the onset of treatment with the <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator)</b> occurred in 56 % of patients treated with r-tPA and 76 % of those treated with TNK-tPA.

The affinity of the enzyme for plasminogen dramatically increases {{in the presence of the}} soluble cofactor while the catalytic rate constant does not change significantly (KM drops from 83 to 0. 18 microM and kcat increases from 0. 07 to 0. 28 s- 1 for <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> of melanoma origin). Fragments containing the lysine-binding sites of plasminogen compete with plasminogen for interaction with CNBr-digested fibrinogen.

Confluent monolayers were incubated with purified APC {{under various conditions}} and changes in total fibrinolytic activity and {{in the level of}} <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> and <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> inhibitor (antiactivator) were monitored. The addition of APC to the cells in the absence of other blood or plasma components led to a rapid, dose-dependent increase of fibrinolytic activity both in the media and in cellular extracts. For example, 3. 4 micrograms of APC per ml resulted in a 15 -fold increase of fibrinolytic activity in the medium within 1 hour. The enhanced fibrinolytic activity reflected increases in both the urokinase-related and <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activators</b> produced by these cells. Interestingly, treatment of cells with APC also caused a rapid, dose-dependent decrease in antiactivator activity. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate-inactivated APC did not decrease antiactivator or increase <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator.</b> Although a small but significant direct (i. e., cell-independent) effect of APC on both fibrinolytic activity and antiactivator activity could be demonstrated, the major portion of these changes appeared to be cell-mediated.

The proteinase activities were clearly inhibited by phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride but not by ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, 1, 10 -phenanthroline or leupeptin. Western blotting confirmed these enzymes to be <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> and urokinase-type plasminogen activator, respectively. High activities of <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> and urokinase-type plasminogen activator were detected in the CSF of mice with eosinophilic meningitis, and correlated positively with CSF eosinophil numbers and total protein, respectively. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> and urokinase-type plasminogen activator localised in the endothelial cells of blood vessels, in blood clots and in infiltrated leukocytes. These results suggest that <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> and urokinase-type plasminogen activator may be {{play a role in}} the pathogenesis of eosinophilic meningitis of angiostrongyliasis.

40|$|Background and Purpose—Despite the {{benefits}} of <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> treatment, some stroke patients experience adverse hemorrhagic transformations (HT). Plasma protein levels of MMP 9 {{have been associated with}} HT occurrence. We aimed to analyze the association of the MMP 9 gene with HT occurrence. Methods—We analyzed the MMP 9 gene in blood samples from 885 stroke patients treated with <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> by tag-SNP, imputed SNP, direct sequencing, and RNA expression. Results—We did not observe any significant association between MMP 9 genetic variations or MMP 9 expression and HT occurrence. Moreover, no association was found between MMP 9 expression and MMP 9 polymorphisms. Conclusions—Genetic variations in the MMP 9 gene are not associated with HT occurrence in tissue-type plasminogen activator-treated patients. (Stroke. 2012; 43 : 1398 - 1400.) Key Words: genetics <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> <b>Tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> (tPA) is the only drugapproved for the acute treatment of ischemic stroke, but its great benefits are counterbalanced by undesired effects such as symptomatic hemorrhagic transformations (HT), occurring in 1. 5 % to 4 % of cases. 1 Symptomatic HT are parenchymal hemorrhages associate...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose—We {{evaluated}} {{the association between}} recombinant <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> recanalization and change in hemostatic markers. Methods—We studied 40 patients. Recanalization was measured with transcranial Doppler. We {{evaluated the}} change in markers of coagulation (fibrinogen) and fibrinolysis (thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor and 2 -antiplasmin) in patients with ischemic stroke treated with recombinant <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator.</b> Samples were obtained before and 90 minutes after recombinant <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> infusion. Results—The analyses (2 -way analysis of variance) showed that {{the change in the}} value of each marker did not depend on the vascular patency status. Conclusion—From a practical point of view, the measurement of these hemostatic markers is probably not useful for predicting recanalization. (Stroke. 2008; 39 : 234 - 236.)

40|$|In recent years, it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that Hsp 70 is released in the extracellular space under normal cell culture conditions, and this release is mediated through exosomes. We have demonstrated that A 6 cells, a clone of mouse mesoangioblasts, produce and release in the extracellular space membrane vesicles, independently of culture growth conditions. These vesicles contains both structural proteins and biological active molecules, such as FGF- 2 and the metalloproteinases MMP 2 and 9. We have also demonstrated that A 6 vesicles contain HspP 70 and its release is highly regulated. Some of the intracellular Hsp 70 is localized on lipid rafts and its concentration in insoluble fraction increases after heat shock. Vesicle shedding is influenced by lipid raft integrity, but not so Hsp 70 release. Recent experiments have demonstrated that A 6 vesicles also contain urokinase and <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activators</b> (uPA and tPA), both responsible of plasmin activation. These two proteins could be responsible for MMP activation, as reported in other cell lines. Recently {{it has been}} demonstrated that MMP 9 expression depends on Hsp 70, through NF-kB and AP 1 activation. Our preliminary data demonstrated that NM 3 cells, a clone with a 55...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{accumulation}} of excessive cholesterol-rich lipoproteins within vascular cells, {{the proliferation of}} vascular cells, and fibrin deposition are hallmark features of atherosclerosis. Evidence accumulated {{over the past few}} years supports the hypothesis that one member of the LDL receptor family, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), affects the dynamics of each of these processes. LRP is expressed in several vascular cell types, including smooth muscle cells, and in macrophages, and is also expressed in these cells in atherosclerotic lesions. This receptor is a large endocytotic receptor that mediates the catabolism of a number of molecules known to be important in vascular biology, including apolipoprotein E- and lipoprotein lipase-enriehed lipoproteins, thrombospondin, and <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activators.</b> The capacity of LRP to mediate lipoprotein catabolism may be a factor in the development of the lesion by contributing to the formation of foam cells. LRP has recently been shown to mediate the catabolism of thrombospondin, a molecule that has potent biological effects on cells of the vasculature. The regulation of its extracellular accumulation by LRP might modulate the dynamic processes of tissue remodeling associated with the response to vascular injury. In addition, LRP regulates the expression of plasinin activity by directly binding and mediating the cellular internalization of urokinase- and <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activators.</b> The cellular removal of these two enzymes decreases the local profibrinolytic potential, possibly leading to a thrombotic state at lesio...|$|R
40|$|Urokinase- and <b>tissue-type</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activators</b> (u-PA and t-PA) were {{identified}} immunohistochemically during re-epithelialization of mouse and human skin wounds, {{by means of}} polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. In incised mouse skin wounds u-PA immunoreactivity was found in keratinocytes {{at the edge of}} the wound after 12 h, and at days 2 to 10 after wounding it was found in virtually all keratinocytes of the epithelial outgrowth that gradually covered the wound. At day 14, the epidermis appeared normal and no u-PA immunoreactivity was detected. t-PA immunoreactivity was found from day 5 to day 10 in some keratinocytes located superficially in the epidermal outgrowths near the edge of the mouse wounds. In 3 - and 5 -day old human skin wounds, u-PA immunoreactivity was found in keratinocytes in the epithelial outgrowths, whereas no t-PA immunoreactivity was detected. No u-PA and no t-PA immunoreactivity was found in normal mouse and human epidermis. The specificity of the staining was supported by a variety of controls, including absorption of the polyclonal antibodies with highly purified u-PA and t-PA preparations and zymographic analysis of extracts of wound tissue. The function of the <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activators</b> during reepithelialization is discussed and it is suggested that the keratinocytes use plasmin activated by u-PA for dissecting their way through the provisional matrix in the upper part of the granulation tissue...|$|R
