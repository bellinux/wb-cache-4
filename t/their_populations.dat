5|$|Global warming {{represents}} a future threat by changing habitat. Reptiles are more unsafe than birds {{because they have}} less ability to move large distances. Gibbons and colleagues do not describe any examples of impact on specific state reptile species, although they mention a general concern for turtles and crocodillians having <b>their</b> <b>populations</b> become imbalanced—the animals sexes are determined by temperature of the eggs.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century Richmond and {{neighbouring}} Twickenham on {{the opposite}} bank of the Thames, {{both of which were}} distant from London but enjoyed efficient transport links to the city via the river, became extremely fashionable, and <b>their</b> <b>populations</b> began to grow rapidly. As the ferry was unable to handle large loads and was often cancelled due to weather conditions, the river crossing became a major traffic bottleneck.|$|E

5|$|Redfish and trout {{were once}} the main {{species of fish}} living in the lake, until the {{construction}} of an embankment reduced <b>their</b> <b>populations.</b> A large quantity of silt is now deposited in the lake from the Guadalupe River, after the dredging of a freshwater channel that supplies farmers and the Union Carbide plant in Seadrift. The channel has negatively affected the delta ecosystem by diminishing the river's nutritional input.|$|E
5|$|The Apiary Laboratory, {{more often}} {{referred}} to as the Apiary, is a research laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Originally built for the study of honey bees and apiculture, today it is primarily used to study native pollinator species and the chemicals and pathogens impacting <b>their</b> <b>populations.</b> This academic building is unique in that it is credited as being the first in the United States to be erected exclusively for the teaching of beekeeping.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth for}} many towns was only temporary. Growth in some {{communities}} was often driven by exploitation of limited oil resources, so once wells ran dry or demand slowed, <b>their</b> <b>populations</b> rapidly declined. When Wortham's boom ended, the population crashed from its 1927 peak of 30,000 to 2,000 people in 1929. The population of Breckenridge dropped from a similar high to 7,569 in 1930.|$|E

50|$|The Yehowist {{population}} {{is small and}} there are no accurate estimates to the number of Yehowists because it is a closed religious organization. Ilyinites never provide any information about <b>their</b> <b>population</b> and also about internal life and activity of <b>their</b> communities. <b>Their</b> <b>population</b> is believed to grow due to proselytism.|$|R
5|$|This {{population}} {{issue was}} {{a significant part of}} the impetus for the recent merger of Old Ikata with Seto and Misaki. While Old Ikata is geographically more accessible, and has enjoyed the economic benefits of the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant, Seto and Misaki have experienced even more severe aging and decline of <b>their</b> <b>populations.</b> In 2000, Seto's working-age population dipped below 50% of its total.|$|E
5|$|William Koons {{constructed}} a furnace on Hunlock Creek in the 1800s. This furnace {{was capable of}} producing 75 tons of pig metal per week. In the early 1900s, major communities in the watershed of Hunlock Creek included Hunlock Creek, Sweet Valley, and Silkworth. In 1921, <b>their</b> <b>populations</b> were 310, 190, and 24, respectively. Around this time, the main industry in the creek's watershed was agriculture.|$|E
5|$|At {{least in}} some species, {{juvenile}} ctenophores appear capable of producing small quantities of eggs and sperm while they are well below adult size, and adults produce eggs and sperm {{for as long as}} they have sufficient food. If they run short of food, they first stop producing eggs and sperm, and then shrink in size. When the food supply improves, they grow back to normal size and then resume reproduction. These features make ctenophores capable of increasing <b>their</b> <b>populations</b> very quickly.|$|E

5|$|Authentic bird's nest soup is {{made from}} the nests of the edible-nest swiftlet (or white-nest swiftlet), Aerodramus fuciphagus, and the black-nest swiftlet, Aerodramus maximus. Instead of {{incorporating}} twigs, feathers and straw like others in the genus, these two swiftlets make their nest only from strands of their gummy saliva, which harden when exposed to air. Once the nests are harvested, they are cleaned and sold to restaurants. Over the past twenty years, the high demand for the nests of these Aerodramus species has had an adverse effect on <b>their</b> <b>populations.</b> The Niah caves population of black-nest swiftlets plunged from around 1.5 million pairs in 1959 to 150,000–298,000 pairs in the early 1990s through over-harvesting.|$|E
5|$|DDT {{pollution}} in the environment was {{a major cause of}} decline of brown pelican populations in North America in the 1950s and 1960s. It entered the oceanic food web, contaminating and accumulating in several species, including one of the pelican’s primary food fish – the northern anchovy. Its metabolite DDE is a reproductive toxicant in pelicans and many other birds, causing eggshell thinning and weakening, and consequent breeding failure through the eggs being accidentally crushed by brooding birds. Since an effective ban on the use of DDT was implemented in the US in 1972, the eggshells of breeding brown pelicans there have thickened and <b>their</b> <b>populations</b> have largely recovered.|$|E
5|$|Different tammar {{populations have}} {{varying levels of}} {{resistance}} to sodium fluoroacetate. Mainland Western tammars {{appear to be the}} most resistant, while those on Kangaroo Island are much more vulnerable. Tammars from New Zealand are also vulnerable, as the poison has been successfully used to control <b>their</b> <b>populations.</b> Tammars from East and West Wallabi Islands and Garden Island, which do not have plants containing sodium fluoroacetate, are less resistant than mainland Western tammars but are more resistant than those from Kangaroo Island. This suggests that tammars originated in South Australia and developed a resistance to sodium fluoroacetate when they reached Western Australia, where the poison is found in plants.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, {{primatologist}} James Thorn used environmental niche modelling in Indonesia {{to supplement}} the poor population data gathered to date to predict the remaining available habitat for slow lorises on the islands of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo. These estimates indicated that the Javan slow loris was the most threatened by habitat loss, followed by the Sunda slow loris from Sumatra. The Bornean slow loris was in a better situation since much of its range consists of low-risk areas. Both the Bengal slow loris and pygmy slow loris are found in more than 20protected areas, although <b>their</b> <b>populations</b> are either low or insufficiently recorded.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas with}} {{wet and dry}} seasons, soil {{nutrients}} diminish and erosion increases during the wet season. Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that <b>their</b> <b>populations</b> show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season. Rain may be harvested {{through the use of}} rainwater tanks; treated to potable use or for non-potable use indoors or for irrigation. Excessive rain during short periods of time can cause flash floods.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, {{communities}} in the watershed of Harveys Creek included Alderson, West Nanticoke, Shawanese, Pikes Creek, Laketon, and Ceases Mills. <b>Their</b> <b>populations</b> in 1921 were 386, 300, 150, 76, 73, and 55, respectively. The main industries in the watershed at that time were agriculture and summer resorts. As early as the 1890s, the Nanticoke Water Company (which was formed in 1885) pumped water from the creek via gravity lines. In the early 1900s, Harveys Creek and its tributary Pikes Creek were used as a water supply by the Spring Brook Water Supply Company. The creeks supplied Nanticoke, West Nanticoke, Plymouth, and Glen Lyon.|$|E

In addition, more specialist predators include adults and larvae of Coccinellids, hoverfly larvae and lacewing larvae.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, major {{industries}} in the watershed of Roaring Creek included agriculture. However, the creek was also used as water power for a small gristmill. During this time period, major communities in the watershed included Roaring Creek and Bear Gap. <b>Their</b> <b>populations</b> were 407 and 124, respectively. In the early 1900s, the only major industries in Franklin Township were gristmills on the creek {{on the border between}} it and Cleveland Township. There were historically proposals to use the creek as a water supply for Danville, transferring the water via pipes under the Susquehanna River. Andrew Trone once constructed a hotel on the creek.|$|E
5|$|In {{the solitary}} phase, these {{grasshoppers}} are innocuous, {{their numbers are}} low, {{and they do not}} pose a major economic threat to agriculture. However, under suitable conditions of drought followed by rapid vegetation growth, serotonin in their brains triggers a dramatic set of changes: they start to breed abundantly, becoming gregarious and nomadic (loosely described as migratory) when <b>their</b> <b>populations</b> become dense enough. They form bands of wingless nymphs which later become swarms of winged adults. Both the bands and the swarms move around and rapidly strip fields and cause damage to crops. The adults are powerful fliers; they can travel great distances, consuming most of the green vegetation wherever the swarm settles.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{species of}} melampitta is {{believed}} to be threatened with extinction. The greater melampitta is not generally common across New Guinea, but appears to be relatively common in its preferred habitat type when that habitat is studied. The lesser melampitta is less restricted in its habitat requirements and is common over a large area. Because of this, and the fact that their habitat is not considered to be threatened and <b>their</b> <b>populations</b> are considered to be stable, both species are listed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
