5|$|Nickel is a silvery-white metal with {{a slight}} golden tinge <b>that</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> high polish. It {{is one of only}} four {{elements}} that are magnetic at or near room temperature, the others being iron, cobalt and gadolinium. Its Curie temperature is , meaning that bulk nickel is non-magnetic above this temperature. The unit cell of nickel is a face-centered cube with the lattice parameter of 0.352nm, giving an atomic radius of 0.124nm. This crystal structure is stable to pressures of at least 70GPa. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile.|$|E
5|$|After {{an alien}} entity declaring {{itself to be}} God destroys {{spacecraft}} en route to Earth, the Enterprise is launched {{under the command of}} Admiral Kirk to engage the vessel. He re-assembles the former crew, including Spock, and sets out to intercept the alien. As they approach the entity, it transports a humanoid probe on board the Enterprise <b>that</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> variety of forms—including that of Jesus. The crew determine that the being and its craft are from an alternate dimension and have been responsible for the creation of religion of numerous planets to teach their inhabitants its laws in a manner understandable at their points in development. The being is malfunctioning; the crew repair it and send it back to its own dimension.|$|E

5|$|Her most {{important}} 2009 release was the commercially successful Tamil film Kanthaswamy, alongside Vikram. She earned a nomination at the Vijay Awards. Vikram {{said in an}} interview that her role was on par with his, and she easily stole the show on most occasions. Of her character in the film, Saran said that it was the best she has done so far. Also that year she appeared as the female lead in Thoranai. A reviewer said that her glamour and the songs were the only high points of the film. For Thoranai and Kanthaswamy together, she received her third award win, the Amrita Mathrubhumi Award for Best Actress. She then appeared in another English film, Cooking with Stella, which is a comedy <b>that</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> look at the serious nature of relationships between servants and employers. It was selected for the Toronto International Film Festival, which Saran attended.|$|E

25|$|The orange-spotted {{trevally}} is a strong-swimming predator <b>that</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> {{variety of}} prey, including fish, crustaceans, and nekton.

Whether this differs throughout their range is currently unknown. The same study also showed the species has a strong seasonal oscillation in the growth rate, which was fastest during November–April and slowest during May–September.|$|E

25|$|In a {{previous}} section only a simple harmonic force {{was applied to}} the model, but this can be extended considerably using two powerful mathematical tools. The first is the Fourier transform <b>that</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> signal as a function of time (time domain) and breaks it down into its harmonic components as a function of frequency (frequency domain). For example, by applying a force to the massndash&springndash&damper model that repeats the following cycle – a force equal to 1nbsp&newton for 0.5nbsp&second and then no force for 0.5nbsp&second. This type of force has the shape of a 1nbsp&Hz square wave.|$|E
25|$|In an {{adiabatic}} process, {{there is}} transfer of energy as work {{but not as}} heat. For all adiabatic process <b>that</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> system from a given initial state to a given final state, irrespective of how the work is done, the respective eventual total quantities of energy transferred as work {{are one and the}} same, determined just by the given initial and final states. The work done on the system is defined and measured by changes in mechanical or quasi-mechanical variables external to the system. Physically, adiabatic transfer of energy as work requires the existence of adiabatic enclosures.|$|E
25|$|However, this {{identification}} is inexact: a polynomial-time solution with large exponent or large constant term grows quickly, {{and may be}} impractical for practical size problems; conversely, an exponential-time solution that grows slowly may be practical on realistic input, or a solution <b>that</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> {{long time in the}} worst case may take a short time in most cases or the average case, and thus still be practical. Saying that a problem is not in P does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are. For example, the decision problem in Presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in P, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and SAT solvers routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem.|$|E
