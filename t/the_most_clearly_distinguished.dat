30|$|SFL is a {{functional}} model of language {{inspired by the}} work of linguists such as Saussure, Hjelmslev, Whorf, and Firth. The theory, as a general linguistics model of language, was initially developed by M.A.K. Halliday and his colleagues in London during the 1960 s, and its development has been “one of continuous expansion of its ‘territory’ in terms of theory, description, application, interdisciplinary engagement, and so on” (Matthiessen 2010). As the name indicates, SFL distinguishes itself as {{a functional}} theory by the emphasis placed on system in relation to structure. Martin (1984) explains that “it is… the use of paradigmatically based metafunctional components in <b>the</b> grammar which <b>most</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>distinguishes</b> systemic from other functionalist approaches”. The theory has also been particularly concerned with modelling language in context. It is especially well-known for the work on discourse analysis, cohesion, genre and register, appraisal and so on, which have been taken up by scholars working in the humanities and social sciences.|$|R
50|$|The numeral 7 — The {{traditional}} form {{found in}} copperplate penmanship {{begins with a}} serif at the upper left and has a wavy horizontal stroke (a swash). In China and Japan, this numeral is commonly written with such a serif, but no swash and no crossbar through the middle. It is usually written with just two strokes, the top horizontal and the (usually angled) vertical. A short horizontal bar is sometimes used to cross the vertical in the middle, to distinguish the seven from a numeral one, especially in cultures (such as French) that write 1 with an exaggerated upstroke. This form is used commonly throughout continental Europe, parts of the United States, and frequently in Australia.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} {{argued that the}} rules of language, as distinct from its semantic features, are <b>the</b> characteristics which <b>most</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>distinguish</b> language from <b>the</b> communication systems of other species. A number of linguists (e. g., Chomsky 1972, 1980; Pinker 1994) {{have suggested that the}} universal features of grammar (UG) are unique human adaptations showing no evolutionary continuities with any other species. However, recent summaries of the substantive features of UG are quite remarkable in the very general nature of the features proposed. While the syntax of any given language can be quite complex, the specific rules vary so much between languages that the truly universal (i. e. innate) aspects of grammar are not complex at all. In fact, these features most closely resemble a set of general descriptions of our richly complex semantic cognition, and not a list of specific rules. General principles of the evolutionary process suggest that syntax is more properly understood as an emergent characteristic of the explosion of semantic complexity that occurred during hominid evolution. It is argued that grammatical rules used in given languages are likely to be simply conventionalized, invented features of language, and not the result of an innate, grammarspecific module. The grammatical and syntactic regularities that are found across languages occur simply because all languages attempt to communicate the same sorts of semantic information...|$|R

The central region of the molecules which contained mixed areas of predicted helical and sheet conformations showed more variability in residue selection than the COOH-terminal regions.

Nevertheless, most guidelines that govern permissible discharge concentrations or decisions about whether to remediate contaminated sites {{are based on the}} concentrations of contaminants in sediments or water rather than more involved and costly studies based on the identification of biological impacts. The example of heavy metal contamination leaching from an abandoned waste disposal site into the marine environment near Casey Station is used to explore the effects of extraction method (partial extraction using 1 M HCl and a total digest with (HF + HNO₃ + HC 1) on the interpretation of heavy metal analyses.

40|$|A unique {{vertical}} bar among horizontal bars is salient and pops out perceptually. Physiological data {{have suggested that}} mechanisms in the primary visual cortex (V 1) contribute to the high saliency of such a unique basic feature, but indicated little regarding whether V 1 plays an essential or peripheral role in input-driven or bottom-up saliency. Meanwhile, a biologically based V 1 model has suggested that V 1 mechanisms can also explain bottom-up saliencies beyond the pop-out of basic features, such as the low saliency of a unique conjunction feature such as a red {{vertical bar}} among red horizontal and green vertical bars, under {{the hypothesis that the}} bottom-up saliency at any location is signaled by the activity of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> active cell responding to it regardless of the cell’s preferred features such as color and orientation. The model can account for phenomena such as the difficulties in conjunction feature search, asymmetries in visual search, and how background irregularities affect ease of search. In this paper, we report nontrivial predictions from the V 1 saliency hypothesis, and their psychophysical tests and confirmations. <b>The</b> prediction that <b>most</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>distinguishes</b> <b>the</b> V 1 saliency hypothesis from other models is that task-irrelevant features could interfere in visual search or segmentation tasks which rely significantly on bottom-up saliency. For instance, irrelevant colors can interfere in an orientation-based task, and the presence of horizontal and vertical bars can impair performance in a task based on oblique bars. Furthermore, properties of the intracortical interactions and neural selectivities in V 1 predict specific emergent phenomena associated with visual grouping. Our findings support the idea that a bottom-up saliency map can be at a lower visual area than traditionally expected, with implications for topdown selection mechanisms.

40|$|The {{representatives of}} Pisces family, namely Gobidae are an {{important}} component of aquatic ecosystems. With a wide range of adaptation, this group has mastered the different types of fish ponds from completely fresh to the ocean. However, some species are found both in one and in other waters, displaying different (and sometimes conflicting) between a life strategy. Last relating to the four main components of the life of fish: water-salt metabolism, nutrition, respiration and reproduction. Mechanisms for implementing these different functions together. First, different concentrations of salts require different types of water- salt metabolism. Another equally important factor is the food base, which is also quite different, both in range and the nature of food. In the sea and reservoirs, over rivers, dissolved oxygen in the water is stratified, and very often in the summer and winter time is in short supply. For bulls, as the bottom of vertebrates, this fact is choking on a large scale. Moreover, in these bodies of water, {{there are a number of}} abiotic and biotic factors, which have different requirements in the process of reproduction. The totality of the above conditions vital for fish of Gobidae, makes the need for populations in the gene pool of potential adaptations to survive in those or other settings. Literature data of recent years, the enlargement of habitat bulls, indicating the presence of adaptations. In reservoirs in Ukraine in modern conditions the optimal conditions for Sandpiper observed in the Azov Sea. This contributes greatly to the optimal forage which has emerged over the last decade due to the desalination of sea and favorable conditions for reproduction. In the transition from marine to freshwater Sandpiper flagged fundamentally different and very diverse in every way possible. The difference in environmental conditions differently reflected in the life Bychkov fish, affecting their growth, development and other physiological processes. The result of this effect is the difference in weight, size and body parts. To clarify, as our model species was taken Cottus Sandpiper (Neogobius fluviatilis Pallas). The reason for this was the fact that this species, along with other Ponto- Caspian solonovato - freshwater gobies, the International Union for Conservation of Nature classified as species biology are poorly understood and require further research. This fact that deepened interest of ichthyologists in this group of fish, in this regard appeared in the literature as material for the bulls and in Sandpiper. Based on the above, the purpose of this paper is a comparative morphometric parameters characteristic of individuals of this species of fresh and salt water bodies of Ukraine. All this affects the absolute morphometric parameters, which decrease in the direction from sea to the river. However, it should be noted that in rivers with rich feeding grounds sheer size of some individuals close to the size and species of sea Kakhovskoe reservoir. This situation is observed in the Sandpiper Grouse River. Here are some specimens reach a length (TL) 118 - 148 mm and a weight of 15 - 36 g, Kakhovskoe Reservoir: 106 - 150 mm 11 - 38 g, in the Sea of ​​Azov: 115 - 174 mm 17 - 58 g. For relative parameters Sandpiper with these reservoirs are more similar, however, for some of them, there are differences. Among <b>the</b> latter is <b>most</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>the</b> ratio SL / N. This indicator podovzhenist (prohonystist) body. As pointed out by VP Mitrofanov (1977), this indicator shows the hydrodynamic qualities of fish: the larger the index, the more active lifestyle is individual. When compared with individuals with a little water and a large stream, in the latter case, individuals are more elongated. This is confirmed by our material: the ratio SL / L for the smallest species of sea of ​​Azov (4. 96), slightly more for Kakhovsky reservoir (5. 52) and even more for rivers Grouse, Trubizh, Desna, Ros (respectively 5, 86, 6. 22, 6. 26, 6. 44). This article directly deals with the analysis of morphometric parameters of monkey go-by (Neogobius fluviatilis Pallas, 1814) which comes from the Sea of Azov, Kakhovka reservoir and such rivers as Trubizh, Teteriv, Ros and Desna. The cluster analysis in 14 morphometric parameters shoved a significant difference between the sea, reservoir and river populations. The fresh water species show a tendency to be smaller in size and in weight. At the same time it was revealed the increase of mentioned above parameters, especially in rivers, where there is a rich food supply, which indicates the increase of moving into fresh water by this species.
