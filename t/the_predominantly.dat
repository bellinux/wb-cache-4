On 17 August an open revolt broke out among the Croatian Serbs, centred on <b>the</b> <b>predominantly</b> Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland near Knin and parts of Lika, Kordun, Banovina and Slavonia.|$|E
5|$|After the Wind of Change of {{the early}} 1960s, the British {{government}} under Harold Wilson and <b>the</b> <b>predominantly</b> white minority government of the self-governing colony of Rhodesia, led by the Prime Minister Ian Smith, were unable to agree terms for the latter's full independence. Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence on 11 November 1965. This was deemed illegal by Britain and the United Nations (UN), each of which imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a dispute}} over the terms for the {{granting}} of full statehood, <b>the</b> <b>predominantly</b> white minority government of Rhodesia, headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith, unilaterally declared independence from Britain on 11 November 1965. Because British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and Whitehall had been insisting on an immediate transfer to majority rule before independence, this declaration went unrecognised and caused Britain and the United Nations (UN) to impose economic sanctions on Rhodesia.|$|E

After the Diet of Transylvania expelled the Jesuits in December 1588, Pope Sixtus V excommunicated Sigismund. Andrew went to Transylvania and sent letters to Rome to achieve a reconciliation, emphasizing that the Jesuits' aggressive proselytizing policy had contributed to their unpopularity in <b>the</b> <b>predominantly</b> Protestant principality.|$|E

5|$|Sequence {{analysis}} {{suggests that the}} catalytic β subunits diverged earlier in evolution than <b>the</b> <b>predominantly</b> structural α subunits. In bacteria that express a 20S proteasome, the β subunits have high sequence identity to archaeal and eukaryotic β subunits, whereas the α sequence identity is much lower. The presence of 20S proteasomes in bacteria may result from lateral gene transfer, while the diversification of subunits among eukaryotes is ascribed to multiple gene duplication events.|$|E

5|$|The Umayyad Caliphate had conquered Syria, Egypt, and North Africa from <b>the</b> <b>predominantly</b> Christian Byzantine Empire, and Hispania {{from the}} Visigothic Kingdom.

Pisa, Genoa, and the Principality of Catalonia began to battle various Muslim kingdoms for control of the Mediterranean Basin, exemplified by the Mahdia campaign and battles at Majorca and Sardinia.|$|E

5|$|The {{club was}} formed {{following}} {{a meeting at}} the Eastville Restaurant in Bristol in September 1883.

5|$|The common council {{consists}} of 10 members, six {{of whom are}} elected from single-member districts. The other four, including its president, are elected at-large. The council has eight standing committees for issues including transportation, education, finance and public safety. There is a relative balance between the Democratic and Republican parties, a change from <b>the</b> <b>predominantly</b> single-party politics of the 20thcentury. Throughout the 1950s, Democrats ran the city council and mayoralty.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Sunni Muslims were Arab nationalists, but not Ba'athist, making them feel alienated. The party was chiefly dominated by minority {{groups such as}} Alawites, Druzes, and Isma'ilis, and people from the countryside in general; this created an urban–rural conflict based predominantly on ethnic differences. With its coming to power, the Ba'ath Party was threatened by <b>the</b> <b>predominantly</b> anti-Ba'athist sentiment in urban politics—probably the only reason why the Ba'athists managed {{to stay in power}} was the rather weakly organised and fragmented opposition it faced.|$|E

5|$|The {{period of}} Dutch rule saw growing hostility between the Catholic Belgian provinces and <b>the</b> <b>predominantly</b> Protestant Dutch. The Belgian provinces also {{complained that they}} were {{underrepresented}} by the Kingdom's system of government, where 55 Belgian deputies were allocated to represent 3.5million people, while {{an equal number of}} Dutch deputies represented just two million. When the States-General voted against adopting the new unrepresentative constitution, William declared that the minority favorable vote outweighed the negative vote. Liberals in Belgium also accused William of attacking personal and religious freedoms.|$|E
5|$|After the Croatian Democratic Union won 1990 {{parliamentary}} {{elections in the}} Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions between Croats and Serbs within the Republic worsened. The ethnic groups are also divided along religious lines as the Croats are Catholics while the Serbs are Orthodox Christians. The Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) confiscated the weapons of Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana - TO) forces to minimize resistance. On 17 August, tensions escalated into an open revolt by Croatian Serbs, centred on <b>the</b> <b>predominantly</b> Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, {{and parts of the}} Lika, Kordun, Banovina and eastern Croatia. This revolt was followed in January 1991, by two unsuccessful attempts by Serbia, supported by Montenegro and Serbia's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo, to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency's approval for a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces.|$|E
