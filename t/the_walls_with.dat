5|$|As an {{alternative}} to the time-consuming task of creating a breach, an escalade could be attempted to capture <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>with</b> fighting along the walkways behind the battlements. In this instance, attackers would be vulnerable to arrowfire. A safer option for those assaulting a castle was to use a siege tower, sometimes called a belfry. Once ditches around a castle were partially filled in, these wooden, movable towers could be pushed against the curtain wall. As well as offering some protection for those inside, a siege tower could overlook the interior of a castle, giving bowmen an advantageous position from which to unleash missiles.|$|E
5|$|The Brancacci Chapel, in the {{basilica}} of Santa Maria del Carmine, was founded around 1366/7 by Piero di Piuvichese Brancacci. The chapel passed to Piero's nephew, Felice Brancacci, who some time between 1423 and 1425 commissioned the painter Masolino to decorate <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>with</b> {{a series of}} frescoes {{from the life of}} Saint Peter. Peter was the name-saint of the founder, and the patron saint of the Brancacci family, but the choice also reflected support for the Roman papacy during the Great Schism.|$|E
5|$|The Quarrymen—John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ken Brown—went to {{the club}} to arrange their first booking, to which Mona agreed, but said she needed to finish {{painting}} the club first. All four took up brushes and helped Mona to finish painting <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>with</b> spiders, dragons, rainbows and stars. In addition to the four boys' artistic contributions, Cynthia Powell, later to become Cynthia Lennon, painted a silhouette of John on the wall, which can still be seen today. The group often played at The Casbah as other venues, like The Cavern Club, had a jazz-only policy at that time. The cellar—with its original decoration—still exists.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{comprises}} {{a rectangular}} courtyard {{surrounded by a}} curtain wall, with a tower house, or keep, at one corner, and the round Glassin Tower projecting from the opposite corner.

Of the outer court, only an earth bank shows the position of <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> <b>with</b> fragmentary remains of a bakehouse the only visible structures.|$|E
5|$|The {{task force}} sailed on to Euboea, {{and to the}} first major target, Eretria. The Eretrians {{made no attempt to}} stop the Persians from landing or {{advancing}} and thus allowed themselves to be besieged. For six days, the Persians attacked <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> <b>with</b> losses on both sides; however, on the seventh day two reputable Eretrians opened the gates and betrayed the city to the Persians. The city was razed, and temples and shrines were looted and burned. Furthermore, according to Darius's commands, the Persians enslaved all the remaining townspeople.|$|E
5|$|Finally in December, Matilda {{responded by}} {{escaping}} from the castle; the popular {{version of this}} has the Empress waiting until the Castle Mill Stream was frozen over and then dressed in white as camouflage in the snow, being lowered down <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>with</b> three or four knights, before escaping through Stephen's lines in the night as the king's sentries tried to raise the alarm. The chronicler William of Malmesbury, however, suggests Matilda did not descend the walls, but instead escaped {{from one of the}} gates. Matilda safely reached Abingdon-on-Thames and Oxford Castle surrendered to Stephen the next day. Robert had died in the final weeks of the siege and the castle was granted to William de Chesney {{for the remainder of the}} war. At the end of the war the constableship of Oxford Castle was granted to Roger de Bussy before being reclaimed by Henry D'Oyly, Robert D'Oyly the younger's son, in 1154.|$|E

5|$|In {{the three}} royal tombs at Vergina, {{professional}} painters decorated <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>with</b> a mythological scene of Hades abducting Persephone and royal hunting scenes, while lavish grave goods including weapons, armor, drinking vessels, and personal items were housed with the dead, whose bones were burned before burial in golden coffins. Some grave goods and decorations were common in other Macedonian tombs, yet some items found at Vergina were distinctly tied to royalty, including a diadem, luxurious goods, and arms and armor. Scholars have debated about {{the identity of}} the tomb occupants since the discovery of their remains in 1977–1978, and recent research and forensic examination have concluded {{that at least one of}} the persons buried was PhilipII. Located near Tomb1 are the above-ground ruins of a heroon, a shrine for cult worship of the dead. In 2014, the ancient Macedonian Kasta Tomb was discovered outside of Amphipolis and is the largest ancient tomb found in Greece (as of 2017).|$|E
5|$|Mona had booked the Les Stewart Quartet to {{play the}} opening night with Harrison on guitar, but they {{cancelled}} the booking after Stewart and Brown had a quarrel. Stewart was angry that Brown had missed a rehearsal, because Brown was helping Mona to decorate the club. As 300 membership cards had already been sold, Harrison {{said that he had}} two friends in a band called The Quarrymen who would play instead. Lennon, McCartney, Stuart Sutcliffe and Harrison went to the club to arrange the booking, to which Mona agreed, but said she needed to finish painting the club first. All four took up brushes and helped Mona to finish painting <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>with</b> spiders, dragons, rainbows, stars, and a beetle, which still survive. John Lennon was short-sighted, mistaking gloss for emulsion paint, which {{took a long time to}} dry in the dark, damp cellar. Cynthia Powell, later the wife of Lennon, painted a silhouette of John Lennon on the wall, which is also still intact.|$|E
5|$|Oliver Cromwell's army invaded Scotland in 1650, {{during the}} Third English Civil War, and {{defeated}} the Scots Royalists at Dunbar on 3 September. With this victory, Cromwell gained effective control of southern Scotland, but bands of Royalist moss-troopers continued to harry the English supply lines. One such band was based at Dirleton, and Cromwell ordered General Monck and General Lambert, with 1,600 troops, {{to capture the}} castle. This was achieved on 10 November, using mortars to destroy the drawbridge and inner gate. The captain of the moss-troopers was hanged from <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>with</b> two of his comrades. The castle was slighted once more, and although briefly used as a field hospital, it was then left to decay. The soldier and engineer responsible for Cromwell's effective use of artillery was a German, Major Joachim Hane. He also designed fortresses near Inverness and in Ayr, and directed the mortar fire at the siege of Stirling Castle in August 1651. He later spent a year spying for Cromwell's Secretary of State, John Thurloe.|$|E

5|$|On Edward's {{death in}} 1648, Anthony Hungerford, his half-brother, {{inherited}} the castle. The north chapel was extensively renovated {{during this period}} by Edward's widow, Margaret Hungerford, who covered <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>with</b> pictures of saints, cherubs, clouds, ribbons, crowns and heraldry, {{as part of an}} elaborate tomb for her and Edward which cost £1,100 (£136,000 in 2009 terms). The renovation effectively blocked most of the access into the north chapel, making the new tomb the focus of attention for any visitor or religious activity. A number of lead, anthropomorphic coffins, some with moulded faces or death masks, were laid down in the crypt in the mid- to late-17th century. Four men, two women and two children were embalmed in the castle in this way, probably including Edward and Margaret, as well as the final Sir Edward Hungerford, his wife, son and daughter-in-law. Such lead coffins were extremely expensive during the period and reserved for the wealthiest in society. Originally the lead coffins would have been encased in wood, but this outer casing has since been lost.|$|E
5|$|The Jain Temple at Lakkundi marked an {{important}} step in the development of Western Chalukya outer wall ornamentation, and in the Muktesvara Temple at Chavudayyadanapura the artisans introduced a double curved projecting eave (chhajja), used centuries later in Vijayanagara temples. The Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi embodies a more mature development of the Chalukyan architecture in which the tower has a fully expressed ascending line of niches. The artisans used northern style spires and expressed it in a modified dravida outline. Miniature towers of both dravida and nagara types are used as ornamentation on <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> <b>With</b> further development, the divisions between storeys on the superstructure became less marked, until they almost lost their individuality. This development is exemplified in the Dodda Basappa Temple at Dambal, where the original dravida structure can only be identified after reading out the ornamental encrustation that covers the surface of each storey.|$|E
5|$|The castle's Norman stone fortifications {{were added}} {{possibly}} {{as early as}} the 1080s onwards, and were finished before 1115, based around what is now the inner bailey of the castle, forming a stone version of a ringwork. It had four towers and a gatehouse tower along <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> <b>with</b> a ditch dug out of the rock along two sides, the excavated stone being reused for the building works, and would {{have been one of the}} very first masonry castles in England. With its circular design and grand entrance tower, it has been likened to the earlier Anglo-Saxon burgheat designs. In 1096, Roger was stripped of his lands after rebelling against William II and they were reassigned to Roger's brother, Hugh.|$|E

According to Herodotus, the Eretrians were divided amongst {{themselves}} as to {{the best course of}} action; whether to flee to the highlands, or undergo a siege, or to submit to the Persians. In the event, the majority decision was to remain in the city. The Eretrians made no attempt to stop the Persians landing, or advancing, and thus allowed themselves to be besieged.
