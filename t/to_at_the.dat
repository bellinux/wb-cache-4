Institutions are also required to self-assess, like compulsory education institutions they are assessed externally every five years.|$|E
5|$|Aghartas 1976 North American release had {{different}} artwork designed by John Berg, the art director from Davis' U.S. label, Columbia Records. In its liner notes, an inscription said the record should be listened <b>to</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> highest possible volume, and the trumpeter was credited for the arrangements. After it was released, Macero received a complaint from Columbia's accounting department about Davis being compensated $2,500 per arrangement, arguing {{that none of}} the music sounded {{as if it had been}} arranged.|$|E
5|$|By 2017, {{the series}} had sold over 8.5 million units worldwide, outselling even its parent Megami Tensei franchise, which has sold over 7.2 million since its inception. The first Persona was {{referred}} <b>to</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{time as a}} sleeper hit, {{and the success of}} it and Eternal Punishment helped establish both Atlus and Megami Tensei in North America. In Europe, the series did not become established prior to the release of Persona 3 and 4, both of which were highly successful in the region. According to Atlus CEO Naoto Hiraoka, the main turning point for the franchise was the release of Persona 3, which was a commercial success and brought the series {{to the attention of the}} mainstream gaming community. Persona 4 received an even better reception. The Persona series' success has allowed Atlus to build a strong player base in the West, contributing to the success of other titles such as Catherine.|$|E

5|$|In 1844, the London and Croydon Railway {{was given}} {{parliamentary}} authority to test an experimental pneumatic propulsion {{system on the}} railway (referred <b>to</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time as the atmospheric-propulsion system). A pumping station was built on Portland Road; this created a vacuum in a pipe paralleling the railway tracks. A piston extended downwards from the trains into a slit in the pipe, meaning that trains were literally sucked towards the pumping station or blown away from it. The pumping station was built in a Gothic style, with a very tall ornate tower which served both as a chimney and as an exhaust vent for air pumped from the propulsion pipe.|$|E

In 1909, after never previously winning a game, the Lyrup football club won the local riverland league premiership. They subsequently traveled to Mildura where they lost twice to the home team. The Mildura Cultivator praised Oliver's marking and kicking reporting that it {{was as good as}} anyone who had played at the ground. An umpire at the game from Melbourne told Harold that he would be welcome in Melbourne to play football if he wanted <b>to.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of 1909 Oliver was contemplating moving to Queensland to join his sister in the state but two friends, the Musgrave brothers, who played for West Suburbans in Adelaide suggested he come down and visit.|$|E

The meeting concluded with the Druze offering Faisal and the nationalists their backing, though short of any military support. The meeting was {{the first of its kind}} between the Hashemites and the Druze, and afterward Faisal appointed al-Bakri to be his personal secretary and his envoy to the Druze, a post he would serve until 1920.|$|E
5|$|In {{the band}}'s fourth album, 2011's The Here and Now, the band {{set out to}} mix their typical sounds with the music they were {{listening}} <b>to</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. The response was polarising. During the publicity for The Here and Now, the band praised it as a progression for them; {{they did not want}} to reject an album they had just released. But their own lack of belief in the record and their growing concern that they were irrelevant started to severely affect the band's confidence in themselves and their style.|$|E
5|$|In {{the interim}} between the Import Duties Act and the Ottawa Conference, Chamberlain {{presented}} his first budget, in April 1932. The gold standard {{had been abandoned}} {{in the early days}} of the National Government; the Bank of England sought its restoration. Chamberlain, on advice from his officials, declined to restore the gold standard, realising that a devalued pound would improve the balance of trade. Otherwise, Chamberlain maintained the severe budget cuts that had been agreed <b>to</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> inception of the National Government: Chamberlain cut means-tested benefits and public sector wages, which proved to be an unpopular move. He also cut interest rates, which led to a house-building boom in the south of England and supported plans to clear slums. Interest on the war debt had been a major cost in each budget. Chamberlain was able to reduce the interest rate on most of Britain's war debt from 5% to 3.5%. Between 1932 and 1938, Chamberlain halved the percentage of the budget devoted to payment of interest on the war debt.|$|E

5|$|Scully learns from {{blood tests}} that the {{contaminated}} water causes rapid cellular damage and dramatically increases sodium chloride in the body. She tries to ration the drinkable water amongst the three, but discovers Trondheim attempting to hoard what little that remains. Trondheim locks Scully {{out of the}} sewage hold, forcing her to use minuscule supplies to keep Mulder alive. The corrosion eventually eats through the ship's hull, flooding the hold and drowning Trondheim, who cannot unseal the hatch. The agents both lose consciousness shortly before Navy rescuers arrive at their former ship.

Scully says {{that she wants to}} return to the Ardent for more research, but the doctor tells her that the ship sank shortly after their rescue due to the flooding.|$|E
