Trigg called for other plans and prepared estimates. At a meeting of the committee on 27 February 1839, Trigg submitted a plan designed by Major Frederick Irwin, which was estimated to cost £2,300. The committee cut the estimated figure to £1,800, and waited for Governor Hutt to specify how much could be funded by the government.|$|E

5|$|One {{important}} reason for BCal's interest in Concorde was that the British Government's 1976 aviation policy review had opened the possibility of BA setting up supersonic services in competition with BCal's established sphere of influence. To counteract this potential threat, BCal considered their own independent Concorde plans, {{as well as a}} partnership with BA. BCal were considered most likely to have set up a Concorde service on the Gatwick–Lagos route, a major source of revenue and profits within BCal's scheduled route network; BCal's Concorde task force did assess <b>the</b> <b>viability</b> of a daily supersonic service complementing the existing subsonic widebody service on this route.|$|E

5|$|A {{decision}} by the US Army in the mid-2000s to replace all of its CH-47Ds with new-build CH-47Fs by 2017 endangered <b>the</b> <b>viability</b> of the Australian Chinooks. This was because the Australian Army's arrangements for the logistical support of its small fleet of CH-47Ds were heavily leveraged off those for the US Army's large fleet. In response, the Australian Army also established a project to acquire CH-47F Chinooks to replace its CH-47Ds in the mid-2000s. The Australian Government provided initial approval for a CH-47F purchase in September 2007. As part of this decision, the Government chose to procure the helicopters through the US Government's Foreign Military Sales program to minimise potential risks to the schedule and cost of the project.|$|E

5|$|Along with {{questions}} {{over the new}} ships' nomenclature came uncertainty about their actual role due to their lack of protection. If they were primarily to act as scouts for the battle fleet and hunter-killers of enemy cruisers and commerce raiders, then the seven inches of belt armour with {{which they had been}} equipped would be adequate. If, on the other hand, they were expected to reinforce a battle line of dreadnoughts with their own heavy guns, they were too thin-skinned to be safe from an enemy's heavy guns. The Invincibles were essentially extremely large, heavily armed, fast armoured cruisers. However, <b>the</b> <b>viability</b> of the armoured cruiser was already in doubt.

5|$|Both VAT and SAT were criticised in 1954 {{by heavy}} vehicle {{importers}} {{because the two}} companies had access to {{a large share of}} the limited foreign currency reserves for component supply. The importers' representatives said neither Sisu nor Vanaja were very domestic products and the vehicles the importers represented were actually more domestic because some assembly work was done in Finland. According to the Association of Vehicle Importers, the domestic vehicles cost between 30% and 80% more compared to imported ones. The following year, the government started to investigate possibilities for importing heavy vehicles in kit form to reduce foreign-currency expenditure. VAT and SAT expressed doubts about <b>the</b> <b>viability</b> of such production. In 1957, the government ended restrictions on the import of heavy vehicle chassis.
