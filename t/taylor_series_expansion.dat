40|$|Abstract—An {{analytical}} method based on combination of Fourier transform and <b>Taylor’s</b> <b>series</b> <b>expansion</b> is presented for analyzing interaction of electromagnetic cylindrical waves with inhomogeneous planar layered media. In the proposed method, constitutive parameters and Fourier transformed electric and magnetic fields of inhomogeneous layer are expressed using <b>Taylor’s</b> <b>series</b> <b>expansion.</b> The {{validity of the}} method is verified by considering some special types of inhomogeneous media and comparing the obtained results by the presented method {{with those of other}} reported methods.
