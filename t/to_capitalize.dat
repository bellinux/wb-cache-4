40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the implications of}} allowing quota rents <b>to</b> become <b>capitalized.</b> Capitalized quota rents crowd out physical capital in savers'portfolios, reducing the capital stock.

I use an overlapping generations model to provide examples which illustrate the difficulty of removing a quota once its rents have been fully capitalized. This work has implications for any policy which could lead <b>to</b> <b>capitalized</b> rents. Copyright 1995 Blackwell Publishers Ltd [...] ...|$|R
