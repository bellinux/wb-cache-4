5|$|As Näslund's {{free agency}} {{approached}} on 1 July 2008, Näslund {{made it clear}} that the style of play and the player personnel of a <b>team</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> important factors in determining which team he would sign with after his contract with the Canucks expired. He was admittedly frustrated with Vigneault's defensive coaching style.|$|E
5|$|CAPCOM Dan Burbank {{advised the}} crew that the damage did not {{initially}} {{appear to be}} serious, but assured the crew that the image analysis <b>team</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> reviewing the imagery further, and engineers on the ground would be analyzing it {{to determine if a}} focused inspection would be required.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{rumors that}} the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> sold and/or relocated, the Mariners—who had had only two winning seasons (1991 and 1993) since {{beginning}} play in 1977—mounted a late-season comeback in 1995 to clinch their first postseason appearance in franchise history. They then mounted a series of comebacks in the ALDS, first overcoming a 2-game series deficit to force a deciding Game 5, then tying Game 5 in the 8th inning to force extra innings, and finally a one-run 11th inning deficit that was overcome by the Double.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, South Bend {{community}} leaders began seeking a minor-league baseball {{team for the}} city. A stadium was constructed in 1986 and a 10-year player-development contract was signed with the Chicago White Sox. The <b>team</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> known as the South Bend White Sox. In 1994, the team's name was changed to the South Bend Silver Hawks. The Silver Hawks changed their name to The South Bend Cubs in 2015. They are a Class A minor league affiliate of the Chicago Cubs in the Midwest League.|$|E
5|$|In February 1946, the NHL officially {{stated that}} the trophy {{was to go to}} the team that allowed the fewest number of goals during the regular season. The goaltender playing the most games for that <b>team</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> awarded the Trophy. Manager Tommy Gorman of the Montreal Canadiens stated that if the trophy was awarded to his team, {{management}} would decide which of the Habs' two goaltenders (Paul Bibeault and Bill Durnan) would receive the trophy. However, at a banquet that October, NHL President Clarence Campbell indicated that while the league was considering changing the voting methods of the Calder, Hart, and Lady Byng Trophies, the criteria for the Vezina were not actually changing.|$|E
5|$|In the {{off-season}} Shero {{decided that the}} <b>team</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more successful if he coached them like he had coached his minor league teams. Upon being elevated to the NHL, he {{had decided not to}} employ systems like he did in the minors, stating that he had too much respect for NHL players. However, he decided that since he had the same kind of players on the Flyers as he did in the minors, he would use the same systems, becoming the first coach to employ systems.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the last}} tournament in which all teams played in the same tournament. After this tournament, the Asian Cricket Council decided to split the tournament into two divisions.

5|$|On April 29, the {{day after}} the 2013 NBA Draft entry {{deadline}} (with McGary and Robinson returning), the team was ranked ninth by ESPN's Jason King and ESPN's Andy Katz. CBSSports.com's staff ranked Michigan as #4. ESPN's Dick Vitale predicted that the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a preseason seventh on May 2. The following day, Nicole Auerbach and Scott Gleeson of USA Today projected the Woverines as the seventh-ranked team. On May 30, Sporting News Mike DeCourcy selected Michigan as number seven.|$|E
5|$|On February 20, 2007, Major League Baseball and Rawlings {{announced}} that an all-time Gold Glove <b>Team</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> named during the 50th {{anniversary of the}} first Gold Glove Awards. Rawlings asked 70 baseball reporters, former players and former managers to select 50 names for the ballot, from an initial selection of 250 names. The team was selected by fans, who voted at the Rawlings Gold Glove website, at United States Postal Service offices, and at sporting goods stores. The results were announced at the 2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|The Saudi Arabia women's {{national}} football <b>team</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{the national team}} representing the kingdom in inter{{national football}}. However, the team does not yet exist because of influence of religious leaders in Saudi Arabia, systematic discrimination against women's sport, and active opposition of political leaders and sport administrators. International pressure has come {{to bear on the}} country to field a women's team, and FIFA now allows the hijab to be worn in competition. A meeting at the College of Business Administration in Jeddah was seen as a possible first step in a team eventually being created.|$|E

5|$|The next day, it {{was further}} {{revealed}} {{that not only}} Bruyneel stood to be forced from the team according to Vinokourov, but also Armstrong and other riders from the former Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team. The <b>team</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> built around Vinokourov and Contador, who {{would be able to}} choose which riders he wanted his teammates. It would contain almost exclusively Kazakhstani and Spanish riders, {{in the image of the}} former Liberty Seguros team, for which Contador previously rode. The matter was even addressed by the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev. The new team organization would be in place by the Vuelta a España, which Vinokourov would ride.|$|E
5|$|The {{old wooden}} {{roof of the}} stand was due to be {{replaced}} {{the day after the}} Lincoln match, because it did not meet the safety regulations required for Division Two, where the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> playing in the following season. Instead, it took until July 1986 for rebuilding work to begin. The ground was used for reserve team fixtures from September 1985, but only journalists and club officials were present to watch. Bradford City's senior team played home games at other grounds in West Yorkshire for 19months while Valley Parade was rebuilt. The new ground cost £2.6million to rebuild, and was reopened in December 1986.|$|E
5|$|Accepting {{the offer}} on January 19, 2009, Ryan {{immediately}} began {{to carry out a}} plan of action that he had outlined for the franchise's future. He planned to remove the players from distractions {{on and off the field}} and allow them get to know one another to build team chemistry. Thus, training camp was moved to the campus of SUNY Cortland, where the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> relatively secluded from the media and any other distractions. Ryan and general manager Mike Tannenbaum were also determined to draft a quarterback who could lead and be the face of the franchise. As a result, the team traded up to select Mark Sanchez of USC in the first round with the fifth overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft.|$|E

5|$|During 1989 Prost {{began to}} {{contemplate}} starting his own team, as {{his relationship with}} his McLaren teammate, Ayrton Senna, had turned sour. Prost and John Barnard, formerly chief designer at McLaren, came close to founding a team in 1990; but a lack of sponsorship meant that this was not possible, so Prost moved to Ferrari and Barnard left Ferrari to join Benetton. After falling out with the Italian team at the end of 1991, Prost found himself without a drive for 1992; after the failure of extensive negotiations with Guy Ligier about buying his Ligier team, Prost decided to join Williams for 1993. In 1995, when Prost was working for Renault, people began to assume that a Prost-Renault <b>team</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> formed in the near future. Renault refused Prost's request to supply engines for his team, ending the speculation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} vacation, while the first-string team {{plays in the}} prefectural {{qualifying}} tournament for Koshien, Maeno has the portable team practice at a recently closed elementary school with the support from a mysterious old man. The portable team also has six practice matches with other local high schools, all of which reached semifinals or higher in the regional preliminaries. Near {{the end of summer}} vacation, the interim principal decides to dissolve the portable team. However, Coach Maeno asks for a rematch scrimmage with the first-string team, after which the losing <b>team</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> dissolved and that coach would leave. The portable team, playing with Aoba, wins a narrow victory. The first-string team is dissolved, and the head coach and the interim principal leave to work at other schools.|$|E
5|$|Following record attendances at State of Origin {{fixtures}} in Melbourne of 87,161 in 1994 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground), the Australian Rugby League (ARL) {{had planned}} to establish a Melbourne-based team in the Premiership by 1998. However, the disruption caused by the Super League war caused great change to the game in Australia. By May 1997, Super League boss John Ribot pushed for a Melbourne-based club for his competition, which was the rival of the ARL. Former Brisbane Broncos centre Chris Johns became the CEO of the club and Ribot {{stepped down from the}} head of Super League to set up the club. In September 1997, Melbourne announced that Chris Anderson would be their foundation coach, and then Super League announced that the new <b>team</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> named the Melbourne Storm.|$|E

5|$|In June 1963 the Spokane Comets Western Hockey League {{franchise}} {{was purchased}} by a group led by the Maple Leafs, who relocated them to become the Denver Invaders and act as the Leaf's farm team. Though the league did not acknowledge that the Maple Leafs had an ownership stake in the team, they held a majority position with the Denver partners only owning roughly 36%. Following reported losses of $150,000 in their first season, Smythe announced that the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> relocated after the team failed to reach a 2,000 season ticket target by a league-imposed deadline. The team became the Victoria Maple Leafs for the following season. In June 1967 MLGL sold the team for $500,000 to a group from Phoenix, which relocated it to become the Phoenix Roadrunners.|$|E
5|$|Johnson had {{purchased}} the car from a junkyard in 1956. Johnson and his son, Craig, would restore {{the car as}} a father-son project while Craig attended the Georgia Military Academy. The two spent two years and over $1,800 restoring the vehicle. Johnson utilized spare parts from many different sources to refurbish the rusty hulk. He bought the mahogany dash from a parts dealer in Caracas, Venezuela and used Convair 440 aluminum sheets to replace the flooring. After Craig graduated from high school, he attended Florida State on a track scholarship. In 1960, Craig's track <b>team</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in Atlanta competing against Tech. Johnson, wanting to see his son compete, took the Model A to Tech campus, parked it near Towers dormitory, and went to watch Craig compete.|$|E
5|$|The 1989 Draft {{has been}} noted as having been {{exceptionally}} successful for Detroit. While team executive Jim Devellano stated the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> satisfied with two players from that draft {{making it to the}} NHL, seven of them did so. Those seven players (Mike Sillinger, Bob Boughner, Lidstrom, Fedorov, Shawn McCosh, Dallas Drake and Vladimir Konstantinov) amassed 5,995 games played, 1,227 goals, 2,367 assists, 3,594 points and 5,108 penalties in minutes. That draft has also been marked as signalling a paradigm shift for Detroit as prior to that the club was very reluctant to draft players from outside North America. Since then the club has drafted a large number of European as well as other non-North American players. In 2000, for example, they drafted four Swedes, three Russians, two Canadians, one Slovak and one American.|$|E
5000|$|If {{there is}} a two-way tie for first, since both <b>teams</b> advance, there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no extra game. The team that won the {{original}} game between the <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> declared the pool winner, and the other team the pool runner-up.|$|R

However, in the same press release, the league announced that the remaining teams' rosters would feature 24 players {{as opposed to the}} 25-man rosters the league had previously employed.|$|R
