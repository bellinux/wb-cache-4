Baudelaire's translations became definitive renditions of Poe's work throughout Europe.|$|E
5|$|Although {{societal}} {{awareness of}} AIDS had developed {{at a slower}} pace in Canada <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> films regarding the disease had appeared nearly concurrently: both the first Canadian documentary and the first American feature-length film on the subject, Nik Sheehan's No Sad Songs and John Erman's An Early Frost respectively, were released in 1985. However, the majority of the early gay artists with AIDS had died by the time Hoolboom made Frank's Cock; as such, the film scholar Thomas Waugh considers Hoolboom a second-generation figurehead in AIDS activism and one of the earliest not coming from the gay community.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, {{there is}} also a cost in {{structurally}} keeping inflation lower <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> UK, and China. The result is that seen from those countries, the euro has become expensive, making European products increasingly expensive for its largest importers. Hence export from the euro zone becomes more difficult. This {{is one of the main}} reasons why economic growth inside the euro zone now lags behind growth in other large economies. This effect is strongest in European countries with a weak economy.|$|E

5|$|At {{that time}} in Hawaii, gold coins brought a premium over their face value if {{purchased}} with silver; only gold {{could be used for}} certain transactions, such as paying customs duties. Silver had been heavily imported into the kingdom in the 1870s despite government efforts to slow the flow with taxes, and thus gold was more expensive there in terms of silver <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> which was more stable monetarily. Any large influx of silver into circulation, such as by the Kalākaua coins, meant that silver {{in the hands of the}} public might become worth less in terms of gold. In 1883, Hawaii was in a recession, due in part to a fall in sugar prices because of overproduction.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish monarchy {{appointed}} {{their own}} candidates {{to most of}} the political offices in the viceroyalty, usually favoring Spaniards from Europe. In most cases, the appointees had little knowledge of or interest in local issues. Consequently, there was a growing rivalry between criollos and peninsulars (those born in Spain). Most criollos thought that peninsulars had undeserved advantages and received preferential treatment in politics and society. The lower clergy had a similar sentiment about the higher echelons of the religious hierarchy. Events developed at a slower pace <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> independence movement. This was in part because the clergy controlled the entire educational system in Spanish America, which led the population to hold the same conservative ideas and follow the same customs as in Spain.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{exchange}} rate stability sustained by the Bretton Woods system facilitated expanding international trade, this early success masked its underlying design flaw, wherein there existed no mechanism for increasing the supply of international reserves to support continued growth in trade. The system began experiencing insurmountable market pressures and deteriorating cohesion among its key participants in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Central banks needed more U.S. dollars to hold as reserves, but were unable to expand their money supplies if doing so meant exceeding their dollar reserves and threatening their exchange rate pegs. To accommodate these needs, the Bretton Woods system depended on the United States to run dollar deficits. As a consequence, the dollar's value began exceeding its gold backing. During the early 1960s, investors could sell gold for a greater dollar exchange rate in London <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> signaling to market participants that the dollar was overvalued. Belgian-American economist Robert Triffin defined this problem {{now known as the}} Triffin dilemma, in which a country's national economic interests conflict with its international objectives as the custodian of the world's reserve currency.|$|E

5|$|Birth control {{practices}} were generally adopted earlier in Europe <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Knowlton's book was reprinted in 1877 in England by Charles Bradlaugh and Annie Besant, {{with the goal}} of challenging Britain's obscenity laws. They were arrested (and later acquitted) but the publicity of their trial contributed to the formation, in 1877, of the Malthusian League– the world's first birth control advocacy group– which sought to limit population growth to avoid Thomas Malthus's dire predictions of exponential population growth leading to worldwide poverty and famine. By 1930, similar societies had been established in nearly all European countries, and birth control began to find acceptance in most Western European countries, except Catholic Ireland, Spain, and France. As the birth control societies spread across Europe, so did birth control clinics. The first birth control clinic in the world was established in the Netherlands in 1882, run by the Netherlands' first female physician, Aletta Jacobs. The first birth control clinic in England was established in 1921 by Marie Stopes, in London.|$|E

30|$|But are Japanese {{people really}} uninterested in English {{language}} studies—and by extension, intercultural communication? Sakuragi (2008) contended, “Language education appears {{to occupy a}} far more important position <b>in</b> Japan <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States” (p. 82). Virtually all Japanese students study a foreign language, usually English, through six years of secondary education, and English ability is widely perceived {{as a key to}} scholastic achievement, college entrance, and career advancement. Moreover, many universities have programs in international/intercultural communication by popular demand.
