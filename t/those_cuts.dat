5|$|A {{number of}} witnesses, {{including}} Hannah Cox, {{testified to the}} events of the evening of 26 May and of the following morning. The first witnesses to attract significant cross-examination by William Reader, Thornton's barrister, were the two factory workers, William Lavell and Joseph Bird, who had matched Thornton's shoes to the footprints in the harrowed field. Under cross-examination, both admitted that it had rained heavily between the time the footprints were made and the time they attempted to match the prints. Constable Dales told the jury that Thornton admitted having sex with Ashford before he was searched: that is, before his bloodstained clothing came to light. Mr Freer, a Birmingham surgeon who conducted the post-mortem, testified as to its results, and stated that except for the vaginal lacerations, there were no signs of violence on Ashford's person, and that <b>those</b> <b>cuts</b> could have been caused by consensual sexual relations. Freer's testimony concluded the prosecution case, and as the defendant declined to exercise his right to himself make a statement to the court, the defence began calling witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make <b>those</b> <b>cuts</b> turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E

50|$|FGM is not {{invariably}} a rite {{of passage}} between childhood and adulthood, but is often performed on much younger children. Girls are most commonly cut shortly after birth to age 15. In half the countries for which national figures were available in 2000-2010, most girls had been cut by age five. Over 80 percent (of <b>those</b> <b>cut)</b> are cut before the age of five in Nigeria, Mali, Eritrea, Ghana and Mauritania. The 1997 Demographic and Health Survey in Yemen found that 76 percent of girls had been cut within two weeks of birth. The percentage is reversed in Somalia, Egypt, Chad and the Central African Republic, where over 80 percent (of <b>those</b> <b>cut)</b> are cut between five and 14. Just as the type of FGM is often linked to ethnicity, so is the mean age. In Kenya, for example, the Kisi cut around age 10 and the Kamba at 16.|$|R
40|$|Mussels are filter feeders {{living and}} {{thriving}} {{in the harsh}} conditions of the intertidal environment. Many factors attribute to their success including aggregating in groups, hard shells, but more specifically their ability to strongly attach themselves to substrate with byssal threads. Byssus is a proteinaceous fiber excreted by the byssal foot of a mussel for attachment. It {{is important to understand}} the energy distribution Mytilus trossulus, by investigating the energetic cost of byssus production. In this study we manipulate M. trossulus into producing different amounts of byssus among three treatments over a thirty-day experiment. Three byssal removal regiments: <b>those</b> <b>cut</b> daily, <b>those</b> <b>cut</b> weekly, and <b>those</b> never <b>cut,</b> were measured and analyzed for comparisons in metric growth. The mussels with byssal threads being cut daily showed the lowest percent increases in shell length, height, width, and weight among the three treatment groups...|$|R

25|$|In January 2001, HP {{laid off}} 1,700 {{marketing}} employees. In June 2001, Fiorina asked employees to either take pay cuts or use their allotted vacation time to cut additional costs, resulting {{in more than}} 80,000 people signing up and saving HP 130 million. Despite these efforts from employees, in July Fiorina announced that 6,000 jobs would be cut, the biggest reduction in the company's 64-year history, but <b>those</b> <b>cuts</b> would not actually occur until after the Compaq merger was announced.

25|$|Upon his election, {{he found}} the {{government}} coffers empty, as the state had exhausted itself {{in an attempt to}} recover from overspending on internal improvements during the 1830s. During his term, the government began to recover from the losses of the internal improvements. The Bigger administration had overseen a large reduction in the state's debt, but the government was still unable to make headway on the nine-million dollar debt that still existed. During his first term, he advocated major spending cuts, including large cuts in government employee wages. <b>Those</b> <b>cuts,</b> along with steadily improving state revenues, enabled the government to manage its debt during his first term in office.|$|E
25|$|The EU {{oil embargo}} and the {{restrictions}} on transactions with Iran’s Central Bank have dramatically reduced Iran’s oil sales – a fact acknowledged by Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi to the Majles on 7 January 2013. He indicated sales had fallen 40% from the average of 2.5 {{million barrels per day}} (mbd) in 2011 (see chart above on Iran oil buyers). This is close to the estimates of energy analysts, which put Iran’s sales at the end of 2012 in a range of 1 mbd to 1.5 mbd. Reducing Iran’s sales further might depend on whether U.S. officials are able to persuade China, in particular, to further cut buys from Iran—and to sustain <b>those</b> <b>cuts.</b>|$|E

25|$|The SGR was {{the subject}} of {{possible}} reform legislation again in 2014. On March 14, 2014, the United States House of Representatives passed the SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4015; 113th Congress), {{a bill that would have}} replaced the (SGR) formula with new systems for establishing those payment rates. However, the bill would pay for these changes by delaying the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate requirement, a proposal that was very unpopular with Democrats. The SGR was expected to cause Medicare reimbursement cuts of 24 percent on April 1, 2014, if a solution to reform or delay the SGR was not found. This led to another bill, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (H.R. 4302; 113th Congress), which would delay <b>those</b> <b>cuts</b> until March 2015. This bill was also controversial. The American Medical Association and other medical groups opposed it, asking Congress to provide a permanent solution instead of just another delay.|$|E
25|$|As of 4 January, {{there is}} almost total {{blackout}} in Gaza City, North Gaza, Middle Area and Khan Yunis. 90% of the telephone network, including both cellular service and land lines, is down, since it depends on backup generators with dwindling fuel stocks. Since the Israeli ground operation, 75% of Gaza's electricity has been cut off and the Palestinian technicians face difficulties reaching damaged lines because of the military attacks. As of 7 January, much {{of the population of}} the Gaza Strip continues to live without electricity. By 16 January, the twenty first day of the attacks, most households still do not have any electricity. As of 22 January, twenty five days after the beginnings of the attacks, 40 percent of the 1.5 million population remains without electricity. The remaining 60 percent receive only intermittent supply that can reach only 6 hours per day in the north of the Gaza strip. Spare parts and other equipments are a priority. After 8 days of the ceasefire, a month since the beginning of the attacks, the power plant is working on only one turbine, producing 30 MW instead of the daily full capacity of 80 MW cause of the lack of industrial fuel. By 29 January, the electricity situation has returned to its pre-27 December status, with much of the Gaza strip receiving only intermittent electricity. Certain areas are receiving very little power as a result or some low-voltage lines breakage. In order to meet demand throughout the territory, GEDCO (Gaza Electricity Distribution Co.) has put in place a power cut schedule where Gaza and North Gaza will face power cuts of eight hours three times a week; and the Middle Area and Khan Yunis will face power cuts of 6–8 hours twice per week. <b>Those</b> <b>cuts</b> does include unintentional power cuts.|$|E

40|$|Patterns {{of early}} root and shoot growth and nodulation, {{and the effects}} of {{increasing}} frequency of pruning on leaf dry-matter yield, root dry weight and nodulation of Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium were studied in two pot experiments. In G. sepium the emphasis during early growth was on the production of lateral roots and nodulation; in L. leucocephala it was on the elongation of the tap root. This may have been the cause of delayed nodulation in L. leucocephala as the lateral roots were observed only at 12 weeks after planting. Increasing the frequency of pruning from 12 -week to 4 -week intervals significantly reduced leaf and root dry-matter yields and nodulation in both species. The highest leaf dry-matter yields were produced with 8 -weekly and 12 -weekly pruning regimes, while the highest root weight was produced by the uncut plants. For all nodulation parameters measured, uncut plants performed better than plants cut every 4 weeks, but were inferior to <b>those</b> <b>cut</b> every 8 weeks which, in turn, were inferior to <b>those</b> <b>cut</b> every 12 weeks, indicating that a lenient pruning regime may enhance nodulation and/or nodule longevity...|$|R
