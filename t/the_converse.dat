5|$|The {{fundamental}} theorem of arithmetic {{applies to}} any Euclidean domain: Any number from a Euclidean domain can be factored uniquely into irreducible elements. Any Euclidean domain {{is a unique}} factorization domain (UFD), although <b>the</b> <b>converse</b> is not true. The Euclidean domains and the UFD's are subclasses of the GCD domains, domains in which a greatest common divisor of two numbers always exists. In other words, a greatest common divisor may exist (for all pairs of elements in a domain), although {{it may not be}} possible to find it using a Euclidean algorithm. A Euclidean domain is always a principal ideal domain (PID), an integral domain in which every ideal is a principal ideal. Again, <b>the</b> <b>converse</b> is not true: not every PID is a Euclidean domain.|$|E

5|$|Every {{configuration}} of Rule 90 has exactly four predecessors, other configurations {{that form the}} given configuration after a single step. Therefore, in contrast to many other cellular automata such as Conway's Game of Life, Rule 90 has no Garden of Eden, a configuration with no predecessors.

5|$|The {{fact that}} every {{configuration}} has a predecessor may be summarized {{by saying that}} Rule 90 is surjective. The function that maps each configuration to its successor is, mathematically, a surjective function. Rule 90 is also not injective. In an injective rule, every two different configurations have different successors, but Rule 90 has pairs of configurations with the same successor. Rule 90 {{provides an example of}} a cellular automaton that is surjective but not injective. The Garden of Eden theorem of Moore and Myhill implies that every injective cellular automaton must be surjective, but this example shows that <b>the</b> <b>converse</b> is not true.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{generalization of}} the derivative concerns complex functions of complex variables, such as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers C to C. The {{notion of the}} derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If C is identified with R2 by writing a complex number z as , then a differentiable function from C to C is certainly differentiable as a function from R2 to R2 (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but <b>the</b> <b>converse</b> is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is complex linear and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the Cauchy–Riemann equations – see holomorphic functions.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{similarity}} in how proteins bind the two coenzymes, enzymes almost always show {{a high level}} of specificity for either NAD or NADP. This specificity reflects the distinct metabolic roles of the respective coenzymes, and is the result of distinct sets of amino acid residues in the two types of coenzyme-binding pocket. For instance, in the active site of NADP-dependent enzymes, an ionic bond is formed between a basic amino acid side-chain and the acidic phosphate group of NADP. On <b>the</b> <b>converse,</b> in NAD-dependent enzymes the charge in this pocket is reversed, preventing NADP from binding. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule, and enzymes such as aldose reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase can use both coenzymes in some species.|$|E

25|$|A {{converse}} of a theorem is {{a statement}} formed by interchanging what is given in a theorem and {{what is to be}} proved. For example, the isosceles triangle theorem states that if two sides of a triangle are equal then two angles are equal. In <b>the</b> <b>converse,</b> the given (that two sides are equal) and what is to be proved (that two angles are equal) are swapped, so <b>the</b> <b>converse</b> is the statement that if two angles of a triangle are equal then two sides are equal. In this example, <b>the</b> <b>converse</b> can be proved as another theorem, but this is often not the case.
