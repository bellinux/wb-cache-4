On 3 October 1940 Vichy introduced the statut des Juifs, requiring all Jews in France to register with the authorities and banned Jews from professions such as the law, the universities, medicine and the public service. Jewish businesses were [...] "Aryanized" [...] by being placed in the hands of [...] "Aryan" [...] trustees who engaged in the most blatant corruption while Jews were banned from cinemas, music halls, fairs, museums, libraries, public parks, cafes, theatres, concerts, restaurants, swimming pools and markets. Jews could not move unless informing the police first, own radios or bicycles, were denied phone service, could only use phone booths marked Accès interdit aux Juifs and were only allowed to ride the last carriage on the Paris Metro. The French people at the time distinguished between the Israélites (a polite term in French) who were [...] "properly" [...] assimilated French Jews and the Juifs (a derogatory term in French) who were the [...] "foreign" [...] and [...] "unassimilated" [...] Jews who were widely seen as criminals from abroad living in slums in the inner cities of France. All through the 1930s, the number of illegal Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe was vastly exaggerated, and popular opinion believed that the majority of Jews living in France were illegal immigrants who were causing all sorts of social problems. In a context where the number of Jews in France, and even more so the number of illegal Jewish immigrants were much exaggerated, Ousby noted about the introduction of the first anti-Semitic laws in 1940: [...] "There was no sigh of public opposition to what was happening, or even widespread unease at the direction in which events were heading [...] [...] [...] Many people, perhaps even most people, were indifferent. In the autumn of 1940 they had other <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about; later they could find little room for fellow-feeling or concern for the public good in their own struggle to survive. What happened to the Jews were a secondary matter; it was beyond their immediate affairs, it belonged to that realm of the 'political' which they could not longer control or even bring themselves to follow with much interest".|$|E
2500|$|Scherzinger credits Whitney Houston {{as being}} her {{greatest}} musical influence and idol, saying {{she wanted to}} [...] "be Whitney" [...] when she grew up. She admired Houston {{so much that she}} auditioned with her version of [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] at her Popstars audition. When Scherzinger was growing up in her home town of Louisville, she received a Christmas gift (at the age of six) of a tiny purple boombox and a cassette of Whitney Houston's chart-topping 1985 self-titled debut album. [...] "My parents had no money, but they got me this player and Whitney's album, which had [...] "The Greatest Love of All" [...] on it," [...] Scherzinger recalls. [...] "That was it for me. From that moment on I wanted to sing. Her voice was so powerful; every note she sang just felt like the truth." [...] Scherzinger also named Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Roberta Flack, Sade Adu, Alanis Morissette, Toni Braxton and Tina Turner as her biggest influences while growing up. Scherzinger said that Beyoncé also inspired her, stating: [...] "I am inspired by women like Beyoncé who wear costumes that aren't much but they are real artists and they put real artistry into what they do and that is how I pride myself." [...] Scherzinger said while she is on stage performing, she borrows personas of Tina Turner and Mick Jagger: [...] "The way he [...] prances around stage and the poise he has on stage. But I love Tina Turner's attitude and sass. I steal from her all the time, especially being the lead singer of this group, the Pussycat Dolls, to be fearless and just have that attitude and that soul behind you." [...] Scherzinger also cites Gwen Stefani as an influence. Janet Jackson and MIA are also influences to her. When Scherzinger was older, Mariah Carey became a huge influence to her. She also wished to work with the Black Eyed Peas saying she admired their music. Scherzinger is also a fan of Adele. Critically acclaimed, [...] "Pop Prince", Prince also became a big influence when she was in her teens. Michael Jackson was one of Scherzinger's biggest influences and idols. Paula Abdul, who Scherzinger sat alongside on the judging panel of The X Factor, was one of her influences. When she gained the role on Men in Black 3, Scherzinger said that music was a very big part of her inspiration for the character, which she plays for the film. She said, [...] "I listened to my heavier music and I listened to Led Zeppelin and I kind of got in that frame of mind because music is what inspires me most. I worked with my acting coach a lot and she told me about lots of crazy <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about while I was in character, but I better not tell you what she said." [...] Scherzinger said that the role has inspired her to record differently on her second studio album.|$|E
