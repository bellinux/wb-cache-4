5|$|The divine {{represented}} by light is a motif {{in keeping with}} the sentiment of both the Latin text on <b>the</b> <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> Mary's dress (which compares her beauty and radiance to that of divine light) and on the frame. A separate source of light, which also behaves as if from a divine rather than natural source, illuminates her face. The two pools of light behind her have been described as lending the painting a mystical atmosphere, indicating the presence of God. In the niche behind her, the statues are lit by two candles - symbols of the incarnation, whereas she is bathed in natural light. The artificial light adds to the overall illusion of the interior of the church, which Pächt views as achieved mainly through colour.|$|E
5|$|In the 1st and 2nd centuries, a Roman soldier's clothes {{consisted}} of a single-piece, short-sleeved tunic <b>the</b> <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> which reached the knees and special hobnailed sandals (caligae). This attire, which left the arms and legs bare, had evolved in a Mediterranean climate and was not suitable for northern Europe in cold weather. In northern Europe, long-sleeved tunics, trousers (bracae), socks (worn inside the caligae) and laced boots were commonly worn in winter from the 1st century. During the 3rd century, these items of clothing became much more widespread, apparently common in Mediterranean provinces also. However, {{it is likely that}} in warmer weather, trousers were dispensed with and caligae worn instead of socks and boots. Late Roman clothing was often highly decorated, with woven or embroidered strips, clavi, circular roundels, orbiculi, or square panels, tabulae, added to tunics and cloaks. These colourful decorative elements usually {{consisted of}} geometrical patterns and stylised plant motifs, but could include human or animal figures. A distinctive part of a soldier's costume, though it seems to have also been worn by non-military bureaucrats, was a type of round, brimless hat known as the pannonian cap (pileus pannonicus).|$|E

5|$|Madonna in the Church (or The Virgin in the Church) {{is a small}} {{oil panel}} by the early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. Probably {{executed}} between c. 1438–40, it depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic cathedral. Mary is presented as Queen of Heaven wearing a jewel-studded crown, cradling a playful child Christ who gazes at her and grips <b>the</b> <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> her red dress {{in a manner that}} recalls the 13th-century Byzantine tradition of the Eleusa icon (Virgin of Tenderness). Tracery in the arch {{at the rear of the}} nave contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from Mary's life, while a faux bois sculpture in a niche shows her holding the child in a similar pose. Erwin Panofsky sees the painting composed as if the main figures in the panel are intended to be the sculptures come to life. In a doorway to the right, two angels sing psalms from a hymn book. Like other Byzantine depictions of the Madonna, van Eyck depicts a monumental Mary, unrealistically large compared to her surroundings. The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral's windows. It illuminates the interior before culminating in two pools on the floor. The light has symbolic significance, alluding simultaneously to Mary's virginal purity and God's ethereal presence.|$|E
5|$|The {{cities where}} {{emperors}} lived frequently in this period—Milan, Trier, Arles, Sirmium, Serdica, Thessaloniki, Nicomedia and Antioch—were treated as alternate imperial seats, {{to the exclusion}} of Rome and its senatorial elite. A new style of ceremony was developed, emphasizing the distinction of the emperor from all other persons. The quasi-republican ideals of Augustus' primus inter pares were abandoned for all but the tetrarchs themselves. Diocletian took to wearing a gold crown and jewels, and forbade the use of purple cloth to all but the emperors. His subjects were required to prostrate themselves in his presence (adoratio); the most fortunate were allowed the privilege of kissing <b>the</b> <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> his robe (proskynesis, προσκύνησις). Circuses and basilicas were designed to keep the face of the emperor perpetually in view, and always in a seat of authority. The emperor became a figure of transcendent authority, a man beyond the grip of the masses. His every appearance was stage-managed. This style of presentation was not new—many of its elements were first seen in the reigns of Aurelian and Severus—but it was only under the tetrarchs that it was refined into an explicit system.|$|E

5000|$|While spectator {{sport is}} popular, {{participant}} sport is less so, possibly {{because of the}} heat of the climate for most of the year, and the difficulty of playing football and other sports in traditional clothing.

25|$|Pomegranates {{were usually}} eaten fresh, {{although}} occasionally {{they were used}} to make juice or wine, or sun-dried for use when the fresh fruit was out of season. They probably played a minor part in Israelite cuisine, but were symbolically important, as adornments on <b>the</b> <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> the robe of the high priest and the Temple pillars, and embossed on coinage, and are also listed in the Bible as one of the Seven Species of the Land of Israel.|$|E

25|$|The three central upper panels show a Deësis of monumental and enthroned figures, {{each with}} a halo. They are the Virgin Mary to the left, John the Baptist to the right, and a central figure who may be either God or Christ – a {{distinction}} much debated amongst art historians. Theories include that the panel shows Christ in Majesty dressed as in a priest's vestments, God the Father, or the Holy Trinity amalgamated into a single person. The figure looks towards the viewer with his hand raised in blessing, in a panel filled with inscriptions and symbols. There are Greek inscriptions decorated with pearls on <b>the</b> <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> his robe or mantle, which, taken from Revelation, read REX REGUM ET DOMINUS DOMINANTIUM ("King of Kings, and Lord of Lords").|$|E
25|$|Other Shanghainese {{cultural}} artifacts {{include the}} cheongsam (Shanghainese: zansae), a modernization {{of the traditional}} Manchurian qipao. This contrasts sharply with the traditional qipao, {{which was designed to}} conceal the figure and be worn regardless of age. The cheongsam went along well with the western overcoat and the scarf, and portrayed a unique East Asian modernity, epitomizing the Shanghainese population in general. As Western fashions changed, the basic cheongsam design changed, too, introducing high-neck sleeveless dresses, bell-like sleeves, and the black lace frothing at <b>the</b> <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> a ball gown. By the 1940s, cheongsams came in transparent black, beaded bodices, matching capes and even velvet. Later, checked fabrics became also quite common. The 1949 Communist Revolution ended the cheongsam and other fashions in Shanghai. However, the Shanghainese styles have seen a recent revival as stylish party dresses. The fashion industry has been rapidly revitalizing in the past decade. Like Shanghai's architecture, local fashion designers strive to create a fusion of western and traditional designs, often with innovative if controversial results.|$|E

She manifests as a reddish torso with her {{intestines}} hanging out from under <b>the</b> <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> her T-shirt. She comes from a family of resistance fighters who built tunnels to escape people who invaded Cleave. She makes a deal with Alana to save Marko's life in exchange for being taken with them when they leave the planet, but to do so has to bond her soul to Hazel's. Although Alana is initially reluctant to allow this, she finally relents and soon comes to appreciate Izabel's presence since she can act as a [...] "babysitter" [...] at night and allow Alana and Marko to rest. She has the ability to create realistic illusions with which she can disguise her appearance, although these do not work on machines such as the Robots.|$|E
5000|$|Much of {{the typical}} Cuban {{replacements}} for standard Spanish vocabulary stems from Canarian lexicon. For example, guagua ('bus') differs from standard Spanish autobús. The word guagua originated in the Canaries and is an onomatopoeia stemming {{from the sound of}} a Klaxon horn. An example of Canarian usage for a Spanish word is the verb fajarse ('to fight').

40|$|A high {{strength}} steel sheet is used to make the hollow sections for the body structure of automobiles. The hollow sections, which are typically joined by resistance spot welding have insufficient energy absorption because the joins are not continuous. Thus, to overcome this problem, the hollow section is joined using <b>the</b> <b>hemming</b> process. <b>The</b> <b>hemming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{high strength}} steel sheet was successfully performed using punch with stopper.

500|$|According {{to his own}} estimate, Davidson {{approached}} around 150 to 200 girls a {{year over}} a period of 12 years (he later modified these figures to an overall total of between 500 and 1000). His activities usually centred on the innumerable Lyons, ABC and Express Dairies teashops and their staffs of waitresses. Davidson was mesmerised, says Blythe, by [...] "the ineffable harmonies created by starched linen crackling over young breasts and black-stockinged calves in chubby conference just below <b>the</b> <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> the parlourmaid's frock". Many rejected his advances; a number of teashops considered him a pest and barred him. Landladies took exception to his habit of visiting their female tenants {{at all hours of the}} night. Commentators have found little evidence that he behaved indecently, or molested the girls; he bought them tea, found them rooms, listened to their problems and sometimes found them work on the stage or in domestic service. He styled himself the [...] "Prostitutes' Padre", and asserted to his bishop that this was [...] "the proudest title that a true priest of Christ can hold".|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} year, Rix Nicholas created {{one of her}} most {{extraordinary}} works, which would also be her largest canvas. Standing almost [...] high, and [...] wide, Les fleurs dédaignées ('The despised flowers') is an [...] "unnerving" [...] and [...] "arresting" [...] portrait of a young woman in fashionable eighteenth-century clothing. Painted not with the artist's typical technique, but in a mannerist style, the subject faces the viewer yet is glancing away, her pose tense, expression unreadable, with a bunch of discarded flowers on the ground next to <b>the</b> <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> her enormous formal dress. Although portraying a young lady, the person chosen to sit was [...] "a Parisian professional model and a prostitute, apparently with a reputation for being moody and cantankerous". The pastiche created in this work is striking: a sixteenth-century artistic style, a composition comprising a seventeenth-century tapestry and an eighteenth-century dress, created by a twentieth-century artist. It certainly reflected the scope of Rix Nicholas's abilities and ambitions, and was painted with the specific intention of having it hung at the Paris Salon. When the work was displayed in Sydney in 1927, it grabbed The Sydney Morning Herald critic's attention: ...|$|E
500|$|According to Elisabeth Dhanens, {{the shape}} and rounded top of the {{original}} frame is reminiscent of those found on the top register of panels of the Ghent altarpiece, which are accepted as designed by Jan's brother Hubert. [...] She believes the current frame is too narrow and small, and contains [...] "clumsy marbling". From a detailed 1851 inventory, we know {{the text of the}} hymn inscribed on original frame. The text is written in a poetic form and begun on the lower border and then extended upwards on the vertical borders, ending on the top border. The lower border of the frame read FLOS FLORIOLORUM APPELLARIS; the sides and top MATER HEC EST FILIA PATER EST NATUS QUIS AUDIVIT TALIA DEUS HOMO NATUS ETCET ("The mother is the daughter. This father is born. Who has heard of such a thing? God born a man"). The fifth stanza of the hymn (not included in van Eyck's transcription) reads, [...] "As the sunbeam through the glass. Passeth but not staineth. Thus, the Virgin, as she was. Virgin still remaineth." [...] The lettering on <b>the</b> <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> her robe echoes the inscription on the frame, words similar to those found on Mary's dress in van Eyck's 1436 Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele, a passage from the Book of Wisdom (7:29) reading EST ENIM HAEC SPECIOSIOR SOLE ET SUPER OMNEM STELLARUM DISPOSITIONEM. LUCI CONPARATA INVENITUR PRIOR ("For she is more beautiful than the sun, and excels every constellation of the stars. Compared with the light she is found to be superior").|$|E
5000|$|According to Surjit Singh Gandhi, 52 Rajas {{who were}} imprisoned in the fort as hostages for [...] "millions of rupees" [...] and for {{opposing}} the Mughal empire were dismayed {{as they were}} losing a spiritual mentor. Guru Hargobind requested the Rajas to be freed along with him as well and stood surety for their loyal behavior. Jahangir ordered their release as well. Guru Hargobind got a special gown stitched which had 52 hems. As Guru Hargobind left the fort, the captive kings caught <b>the</b> <b>hems</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cloak and came out along with him.|$|R
5000|$|Extremely short skirts, some as much {{as eight}} inches above the knee, were {{observed}} in Britain {{in the summer of}} 1962. The young women who wore these short skirts were called [...] "Ya-Ya girls," [...] a term derived from [...] "yeah, yeah" [...] which was a popular catcall at the time. One retailer noted that the fashion for layered net crinoline petticoats raised <b>the</b> <b>hems</b> <b>of</b> short skirts even higher. The designer Mary Quant was quoted as saying that [...] "short short skirts" [...] indicated youthfulness which was seen as desirable, fashion-wise.|$|R
25|$|A {{military}} tunic {{is a type}} {{of medium}} length coat or jacket, <b>the</b> lower <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> which reaches down to the thighs all the way round. It is named after the tunic, a garment of similar length worn in Ancient Rome.|$|R

50|$|Broadcloth is {{so called}} {{not because it}} is {{finished}} wide, 54 inches not being particularly wide, but because it was woven nearly half as wide again and shrunk down to finish 54 inches. This shrinking, or milling, process made the cloth very dense, bringing all the threads very tightly together, and gave a felted blind finish to the cloth. These factors meant that it was harder wearing, more weatherproof and could take a raw edge; <b>the</b> <b>hems</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garment could be simply cut and left without <b>hemming</b> as <b>the</b> threads were so heavily shrunk together as to prevent fraying.|$|R
