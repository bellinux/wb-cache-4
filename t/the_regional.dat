5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Regional</b> Congress of the Syrian Regional Branch, in March 1965, devolved {{power from}} the center, the National Command, to <b>the</b> <b>Regional</b> Command.

Aflaq was unsettled by the way things were moving, and in May he convened the Eighth National Congress to get a showdown between his followers and those of the Military Committee. However, this never came to fruition. Several civilian members of the National Command, such as the Lebanese Jibran Majdalani and the Saudi Ali Ghannam, advised caution, believing that if he pressed the Military Committee too hard the military would take over the Syrian Regional Branch, and then the Ba'ath Party—as had happened in Iraq following the ousting of the Iraqi Regional Branch.|$|E
