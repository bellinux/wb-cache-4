Many American readers felt shocked by her observation that young Samoan women deferred marriage for many years while enjoying casual sex before eventually choosing a husband. As a landmark study regarding sexual mores, the book was highly controversial and frequently came under attack on ideological grounds. For example, the National Catholic Register argued that Mead’s findings were merely a projection of her own sexual beliefs and reflected her desire <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>restrictions</b> on her own sexuality.

Another important aspect is the optimization of equivariant Pyragas control, i. e. to construct larger control regions. The ring of n identical Stuart-Landau oscillators coupled diffusively in a bidirectional ring serves as our model. ...|$|E

Exactly the same model system (Hamiltonian) is used in both our simulations and mean-field theory; the ODT shift is therefore due to the fluctuations/correlations neglected by the latter. While χ^* / χ^*_ MF - 1 ∝N̅^-k is found with N̅ denoting the invariant degree of polymerization, k decreases around the N̅-value corresponding to the close packing of polymer segments as hard spheres, indicating the short-range correlation effects.

Methods based on hashing techniques to minimise the cost of answering range queries by taking the query distri-bution into account have previously been proposed.

In an effort to isolate Adi 3 interacting proteins, a yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out and identified the autophagy protein Atg 8 h as an Adi 3 interac-tor. This interaction occurred independent of the kinase activity status of Adi 3.
