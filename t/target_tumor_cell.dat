50|$|Like other bispecific antibodies, {{and unlike}} {{ordinary}} monoclonal antibodies, solitumab forms {{a link between}} T cells and its <b>target</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> antigen. This causes T cells to exert cytotoxic activity on tumor cells by producing proteins like perforin and granzymes, independently {{of the presence of}} MHC I or co-stimulatory molecules. These proteins enter tumor cells and initiate the cell's apoptosis. This action mimics physiological processes observed during T cell attacks against tumor cells.|$|E
50|$|This is not {{the only}} way in which zalutumumab works. It also is {{responsible}} for some antitumor affects through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The Fab, or fragment antigen binding region of the antibody, binds to the antigen on the EGFr expressing tumor cells. Through an immunological response, the body’s natural killer (NK) cells, which are a type of lymphocyte, recognize and bind to the Fc portion on the antibody through an Fc receptor, CD16. The NK cell is then activated through the cross linking of the Fc receptors which sends a signal to induce apoptosis and cell death. The <b>target</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> is then destroyed.|$|E
50|$|Brentuximab vedotin {{consists}} of the chimeric monoclonal antibody brentuximab (cAC10, which targets the cell-membrane protein CD30) linked with maleimide attachment groups, cathepsin cleavable linkers (valine-citrulline), and para-aminobenzylcarbamate spacers to three to five units of the antimitotic agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE, reflected by the 'vedotin' in the drug's name). The peptide-based linker bonds the antibody to the cytotoxic compound in a stable manner so the drug is not easily released from the antibody under physiologic conditions to help prevent toxicity to healthy cells and ensure dosage efficiency. The peptide antibody-drug bond facilitates rapid and efficient drug cleavage inside <b>target</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cell.</b> The antibody cAC10 part of the drug binds to CD30 which often occurs on diseased cells but rarely on normal tissues.The antibody portion of the drug attaches to CD30 {{on the surface of}} malignant cells, delivering MMAE which is responsible for the anti-tumour activity. Once bound, brentuximab vedotin is internalised by endocytosis and thus selectively taken up by targeted cells. The vesicle containing the drug is fused with lysosomes and lysosomal cysteine proteases, particularly cathepsin B, start to break down valine-citrulline linker and MMAE is no longer bound to the antibody and is released directly into the tumor environment.|$|E

However, the effective component and molecular mechanism of FLL act to inhibit tumor proliferation are unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that oleanolic acid (OA), a principal chemical component of FLL, inhibited the proliferation of human leukemia HL 60 cells in culture. MTT assay showed that treatment of HL 60 cells with FLL crude extracts or OA dramatically blocked the growth of <b>target</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Morphological changes of the nuclei and DNA fragmentation showed that apoptotic cell death occurred in the HL 60 cells after treating with FLL extracts (20 mg/ml) or OA (3. 65 × 10 − 2 mg/ml). Furthermore, flow cytometry assay showed that treatment of HL 60 cells with FLL or OA caused an increased accumulation of G 1 and sub-G 1 subpopulations. Western blot analysis showed that caspase- 9 and caspase- 3 were activated, accompanied by the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in the target cells during FLL- or OA-induced apoptosis.

Overall survival with current standard-of-care approaches remains dismal for both humans and dogs, and each is likely to succumb to their disease within a short duration. While angiosarcomas in humans are extremely rare, limiting their study and treatment options, canine hemangiosarcomas occur frequently.

Infection of tumor cells with pAd-T 34 A resulted in cytochrome c release from mitochondria, cleavage of approximately 46 -kDa upstream caspase- 9, processing of caspase- 3 to the active subunits of approximately 17 and 19 kDa, and increased caspase- 3 catalytic activity. When compared with chemotherapeutic regimens, pAd-T 34 A was as effective as taxol and considerably more effective than adriamycin in induction of tumor cell apoptosis and enhanced taxol-induced cell death. In three xenograft breast cancer models in immunodeficient mice, pAd-T 34 A suppressed de novo tumor formation, inhibited by approximately 40 % the growth of established tumors, and reduced intraperitoneal tumor dissemination.

Bezielle therefore belongs {{to a group of}} drugs that <b>target</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> mitochondria, but its cytotoxicity involves inhibition of both cellular energy producing pathways. We found that the cytotoxic activity of the Bezielle extract in vitro co-purified with a defined fraction containing multiple flavonoids.

The resultant extracellular superoxide anions control the proliferation of malignant cells, but they also drive two intercellular signaling pathways that cause selective apoptosis induction in malignant cells, i. e. the HOCl and the NO/peroxynitrite pathway. Tumor progression requires the establishment of resistance against these apoptosis-inducing pathways through expression of membrane-associated catalase that interferes with HOCl signaling through decomposition of H 2 O 2 and with NO/peroxynitrite through oxidation of NO and decomposition of peroxynitrite. Aims: We aimed to establish the biochemical basis for novel therapeutic approaches that <b>target</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> protective catalase and thus cause reactivation of intercellular reactive oxygen/nitrogen species-dependent apoptotic signaling of tumor cells. Methods: We used cells from defined stages of multistep oncogenesis, i. e. nontransformed, transformed and bona vide tumor cells. Intercellular apoptosis-inducing ROS/RNS signaling was studied using defined inhibitors/scavengers, reconstitution experiments and small interfering RNA directed against relevant targets. Results: Direct inhibition of tumor cell catalase by neutralizing antibodies or its direct inactivation by extracellular singlet oxygen caused efficient reactivation of apoptosis-inducing signaling. Interestingly, the increase in cell-derived NO through addition of arginine, inhibition of arginase, inhibition of NO dioxygenase or induction of NO synthase by interferon led to the generation of extracellular singlet oxygen that triggered a complex self-amplificatory system. As a result, high concentrations of cell-derived singlet oxygen inactivated catalase and reactivated apoptosis inducing intercellular signaling.

In this study, we report the application of DEP-based devices for facilitating programmable interactions between microspheres and target tumor cells.
