5|$|Paula Barila Bolopa was Equatorial Guinea's {{only female}} {{competitor}} {{to participate in}} swimming at the Sydney Olympic Games and was 20 {{years old at the}} time of the quadrennial event. She had not entered any previous Olympic Games. Like Moussambani, Bolopa qualified for the Games as a wildcard because she did not meet the minimum qualification standards for the women's 50 metre freestyle. She began swimming two and a half months before the Games. Bolopa took part in the contest's first heat on 22 September, finishing second out of three entered participants, with a time of one minute and 3.97 seconds. The time set a new record as the slowest for a female athlete in the Olympic history of the women's 50 metre freestyle and was double the slowest time of the fastest overall swimmer in the displicine. She received loud support and encouragement from spectators. Bolopa finished second behind the heat's winner Moe Thu Aung of Myanmar (26.80 seconds) after the third participant Fatema Hameed Gerashi of Bahrain was disqualified for a false start. She finished 73rd and last out of all swimmers, and did not progress into the semi-finals because she was 35.90 seconds slower than the slowest competitor who advanced beyond the first round. After the event, Bolopa said <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> tired because it was the first time she had swum in an Olympic-sized swimming pool.|$|E

25|$|Muslims regard Fatimah as {{a loving}} and devoted daughter, mother, wife, a sincere Muslim, and an exemplar for women. It is {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> {{close to her}} father and her distinction from other women is mentioned in many hadith. After Khadijah, Muslims regard Fatimah as the most significant historical figure, {{considered to be the}} leader (Arabic: Sayyidih) of all women in this world and in Paradise. It is because of her moral purity that she occupies an analogous position in Islam to that Mary occupies in Catholic Christianity. She was the first wife of Ali, whom Sunnis consider the fourth Rashidun caliph and the first infallible Imam (Shi'a doctrine), the mother of the second and third Imams, and the ancestor of all the succeeding Imams; indeed, the Fatimid Caliphate is named after her.|$|E
25|$|Jodie Whittaker {{was cast}} as Beth Latimer, {{the mother of}} the murdered boy. She was hired after Buchan and McClure joined the series. Her {{audition}} consisted of several scenes from the first episode. Whittaker admitted <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> nervous about accepting a role in a series whose scripts had not yet been completed. Chris Chibnall, however, told her that none of the actors would know who the murderer was (not even the actor who played the killer) until the last possible moment. She found that highly appealing, for it raised the anxiety level in the actors and reduced each actor's willingness to trust the other characters. She was also impressed by the heart-breaking way the first episode was written, and how many interesting characters there were in the series.|$|E

25|$|By December 1970, Kent and {{the other}} {{hospital}} staff working with Genie saw her as a potential case study subject. That month David Rigler obtained a small grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to do preliminary studies on her, and began organizing a research team to submit a larger request. In January 1971 doctors administered a Gesell Developmental Evaluation and found Genie {{to be at the}} developmental level of a 1- to 3-year-old, noting she already showed substantial developmental disparities. The following month psychologist Jack Block evaluated her with his wife, Jeanne, and her scores ranged from below a 2- to 3-year-old level to, on a few components, a normal 12- to 13-year-old level. Around the same time, doctors noted <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> interested in people speaking and that she attempted to mimic some speech sounds.|$|E
25|$|With {{the death}} of Tutankhamun and the two {{stillborn}} children buried with him, the Thutmoside family line came to an end. The Amarna letters indicate that Tutankhamun's wife, recently widowed, wrote to the Hittite king Suppiluliuma I, asking if she could marry one of his sons. The letters do not say how Tutankhamun died. In the message, Ankhesenamun says <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> afraid, but would not take {{one of her own}} people as husband. However, the son was killed before reaching his new wife. Shortly afterward, Ay married Tutankhamun's widow and became Pharaoh as a war was fought between the two countries, and Egypt was left defeated. The fate of Ankhesenamun is not known, but she disappears from record and Ay's second wife Tey became Great Royal Wife. After Ay's death, Horemheb usurped the throne and instigated a campaign of damnatio memoriae against him. Tutankhamun's father Akhenaten, stepmother Nefertiti, his wife Ankhesenamun, half sisters and other family members were also included. Not even Tutankhamun was spared. His images and cartouches were also erased. Horemheb himself was left childless and willed the throne to Paramessu, who founded the Ramesside family line of pharaohs.|$|E

500|$|Serena and Azarenka met {{in their}} careers' 46th and seventh career finals respectively, with Serena {{appearing}} in her third consecutive final at the event, having won {{on the last}} two occasions.

Azarenka stated <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> nervous in {{the final game of}} the match and described her win as [...] "the biggest moment in [...] career". Serena mentioned that it was difficult for her to move to the left, but she still played with maximum effort.|$|E

500|$|Arguss {{stability}} {{had been}} a concern from the beginning. [...] Despite having been originally conceived as a liner with a hull designed to minimise rolling, most of the changes made to the ship during her conversion added topside weight, raising her centre of gravity. Even the addition of [...] of ballast still left the ship with a very low metacentric height of only [...] lightly loaded and [...] at deep load. This meant <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> steady, but heeled noticeably when turning. The ship proved to be very manoeuvrable at medium and high speeds, but steered badly at low speeds and in wind due to her large surface area.|$|E

She added a few lines to the lyrics and recorded a solo version a few months before the release of the deluxe edition of B'Day (2006). Beyoncé confirmed that she would perform a duet with Shakira in an interview for Univision in December 2006. In another interview for MTV News, Beyoncé said that she met Shakira several times at various awards shows, and they talked about plans to collaborate on a song as they are both fans of each other and respect each other's work. Beyoncé said <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> happy {{that they were able to}} work together after waiting for years.|$|E
