Its height is famous mostly for {{watching}} sunsets from. It is 16km from Chikmagalur town. Driving to Mullayanagiri is worth <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk.</b> On the way is Sitalayanagiri where the water in the Shiva temple neither increases nor decreases. The road to Mullayanagiri is very narrow with a views from steep cliffs. Driving to the peak is not possible and includes a trek up the hill from the halfway point. There is a temple on top of the hill. From the topmost point of the hill the Arabian Sea is visible on clear days. The small hillock in the temple compound is the highest point in Karnataka. The narrow road to the temple makes two way traffic impossible. It is a great trekking spot in Karnataka.|$|E
25|$|As {{with so many}} late Elizabethan {{conspiracy}} theories Spanish calculations may have been of less importance {{than those of the}} queen's councillors. At the outset in 1599 Essex had realised he was <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> in departing the court and leaving the field open to Cecil, a risk that would pay off only if he defeated O'Neill. The Irish campaign proved far more difficult than anticipated - Essex was the last English commander of the age to underestimate rebel capability - and the situation at court deteriorated rapidly, with Cecil gaining an overwhelming influence over the queen. The private parley with O'Neill was especially significant at a time when Cecil was preparing the succession of the Scots king, James VI, to Elizabeth's throne. Essex's flight from Ireland was a desperate attempt to interfere with those preparations, and once this had failed his subsequent treason was down to his refusal to accept that it was Cecil, and not he, who would determine the succession.|$|E

The well known claim eight on Eldorado Creek was sold for as much as $350,000 ($280 million). Prospectors were also allowed to hire others to work for them, either on their first claim or on later purchases. Enterprising miners such as Alex McDonald set about amassing mines and employees. Leveraging his acquisitions with short term loans, by the autumn of 1897 McDonald had purchased 28 claims, estimated to be worth millions. Swiftwater Bill Gates famously borrowed heavily against his claim on the Eldorado creek, relying on hired hands to mine the gold to keep up his interest payments.|$|E

2500|$|Although Dr. Reed has {{received}} {{much of the}} credit in United States history books for [...] "beating" [...] yellow fever, he had fully credited Dr. Finlay with the discovery of the yellow fever vector, and how it might be controlled. Reed often cited Finlay's papers in his own articles, and also gave him credit for the discovery in his personal correspondence. The acceptance of Finlay's work {{was one of the most}} important and far-reaching effects of the Walter Reed Commission of 1900. Applying methods first suggested by Finlay, the United States government and Army eradicated yellow fever in Cuba and later in Panama, allowing completion of the Panama Canal. While Reed built on the research of Carlos Finlay, historian Fran√ßois Delaporte notes that yellow fever research was a contentious issue. Scientists, including Finlay and Reed, became successful by building on the work of less prominent scientists, without always giving them the credit they were due. Reed's research was essential in the fight against yellow fever. He should also receive full credit for his use of the first type of medical consent form during his experiments in Cuba, an attempt to ensure that participants knew they were <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> by being part of testing.|$|E

Although jewellery {{is the most}} commonly pawned item at the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop, most of the customers featured in episodes bring {{in a variety of}} vintage or antique items to the store, which has 12,000 items in its inventory as of July 2011 (5,000 of which are typically held on pawn). Each episode consists of segments devoted to approximately five or six of these items, in which one of the staff members, usually Rick Harrison, his son Corey, or Harrison's father Richard (known as the [...] "Old Man"), explains the history behind the object. When the buyer is unable to evaluate an object, they consult with a knowledgeable expert who can evaluate it to determine its authenticity and potential value, {{and in the case of}} items needing repair, the cost of restoration or preparing the item for sale. Whoever is evaluating the object goes over the potential value with the customer, including the expert's opinion, if one is given, often interspersed with an interview in which he explains the basis of his decision to the viewer. A price tag graphic at the bottom corner of the screen provides the ever-changing dollar amount as the two haggle over the item's price.

[...] David Pelly of Boat International was also enamoured, saying she was [...] "...the most extraordinary yacht launched in recent memory. It is stunning."

It seems to {{have nothing to do with}} the whole idea of yachting, which is about cruising around at a leisurely pace, and enjoying your friends and the sea". Maritime commentator Peter Mello was even more scathing in his assessment, deriding her as [...] "one of the most hideous vessels ever to sail the seas". The Wall Street Journals Robert Frank was initially also an outspoken critic, calling A [...] "one of the ghastliest megayachts ever created" [...] and [...] "more like a cruiser for Darth Vader's navy than a family pleasure boat for the Mediterranean" [...] when she was launched. However, in a follow-up blog several months later, he confessed: [...] "I've gained a bit more respect for it.
