50|$|By itself, Jung's {{theory of}} the {{collective}} unconscious accounts for a considerable share of writings in archetypal literary criticism; it also pre-dates <b>the</b> height of <b>archetypal</b> literary criticism by over a decade. <b>The</b> Jungian <b>archetypal</b> approach treats literary texts as an avenue in which primordial images are represented. It would not be until the 1950s when the other branch of archetypal literary criticism developed.|$|R

5|$|Silver {{was among}} the most {{influential}} jazz musicians of his lifetime. Grove Music Online describes his legacy as at least fourfold: as a pioneer of hard bop; as a user of what became <b>the</b> <b>archetypal</b> quintet instrumentation of tenor saxophone, trumpet, piano, bass, and drums; as a developer of young musicians who went on to become important players and bandleaders; and for his skill as a composer and arranger.|$|E
5|$|Some folk {{figures are}} based on semi or actual {{historical}} people whose story has been passed down centuries; Lady Godiva for instance {{was said to have}} ridden naked on horseback through Coventry, Hereward the Wake was a heroic English figure resisting the Norman invasion, Herne the Hunter is an equestrian ghost associated with Windsor Forest and Great Park and Mother Shipton is <b>the</b> <b>archetypal</b> witch. On 5 November people make bonfires, set off fireworks and eat toffee apples in commemoration of the foiling of the Gunpowder Plot centred on Guy Fawkes. The chivalrous bandit, such as Dick Turpin, is a recurring character, while Blackbeard is <b>the</b> <b>archetypal</b> pirate. There are various national and regional folk activities, participated in to this day, such as Morris dancing, Maypole dancing, Rapper sword in the North East, Long Sword dance in Yorkshire, Mummers Plays, bottle-kicking in Leicestershire, and cheese-rolling at Cooper's Hill. There is no official national costume, but a few are well established such as the Pearly Kings and Queens associated with cockneys, the Royal Guard, the Morris costume and Beefeaters.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} Greek {{thought about}} poetry considered the theogonies {{to be the}} prototypical poetic genre—the prototypical mythos—and imputed almost magical powers to it. Orpheus, <b>the</b> <b>archetypal</b> poet, also was <b>the</b> <b>archetypal</b> singer of theogonies, which he uses to calm seas and storms in Apollonius' Argonautica, and to move the stony hearts of the underworld gods in his descent to Hades. When Hermes invents the lyre in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes, {{the first thing he}} does is sing about the birth of the gods. Hesiod's Theogony is not only the fullest surviving account of the gods, but also the fullest surviving account of the archaic poet's function, with its long preliminary invocation to the Muses. Theogony also was the subject of many lost poems, including those attributed to Orpheus, Musaeus, Epimenides, Abaris, and other legendary seers, which were used in private ritual purifications and mystery-rites. There are indications that Plato was familiar with some version of the Orphic theogony. A silence would have been expected about religious rites and beliefs, however, and that nature of the culture would not have been reported by members of the society while the beliefs were held. After they ceased to become religious beliefs, few would have known the rites and rituals. Allusions often existed, however, to aspects that were quite public.|$|E
5|$|A {{food web}} is <b>the</b> <b>archetypal</b> {{ecological}} network. Plants capture solar energy {{and use it}} to synthesize simple sugars during photosynthesis. As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing herbivores, and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal trophic species to a top consumer is called the food chain. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of concept map or a heuristic device that is used to illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.|$|E
5|$|Boone's adventures, {{real and}} mythical, {{formed the basis}} of <b>the</b> <b>archetypal</b> hero of the American West, popular in 19th-century novels and 20th-century films. The main {{character}} of James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales, the first of which was published in 1823, bore striking similarities to Boone; even his name, Nathaniel Bumppo, echoed Daniel Boone's name. As mentioned above, The Last of the Mohicans (1826), Cooper's second Leatherstocking novel, featured a fictionalized version of Boone's rescue of his daughter. After Cooper, other writers developed the Western hero, an iconic figure which began as a variation of Daniel Boone.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh {{published}} The Messianic Legacy, {{a sequel}} to The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. The authors assert that the Priory of Sion is not only <b>the</b> <b>archetypal</b> cabal but an ideal repository of the cultural legacy of Jewish messianism that could end the “crisis of meaning” within the Western world by providing a Merovingian sacred king as a messianic figure in which the West and, by extension, humanity can place its trust. However, the authors are led to believe by Plantard that he has resigned as Grand Master of the Priory of Sion in 1984 and that the organisation has since gone underground in reaction to both an internal power struggle between Plantard and an “Anglo-American contingent” {{as well as a}} campaign of character assassination against Plantard in the press and books written by skeptics.|$|E
5|$|Metal and {{nonmetals}} can {{be further}} classified into subcategories that show a gradation from metallic to non-metallic properties, when going left to right in the rows. The metals are subdivided into the highly reactive alkali metals, through the less reactive alkaline earth metals, lanthanides and actinides, via <b>the</b> <b>archetypal</b> transition metals, and ending in the physically and chemically weak post-transition metals. The nonmetals are simply subdivided into the polyatomic nonmetals, which, being nearest to the metalloids, show some incipient metallic character; the diatomic nonmetals, which are essentially nonmetallic; and the monatomic noble gases, which are nonmetallic and almost completely inert. Specialized groupings such as the refractory metals and the noble metals, which are subsets (in this example) of the transition metals, are also known and occasionally denoted.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the known}} Ankylosaurus {{specimens}} were not scientifically described at length, though several paleontologists planned to do so, until Carpenter redescribed the genus in 2004. Carpenter noted that Ankylosaurus has become <b>the</b> <b>archetypal</b> member of its group, and the best known ankylosaur in popular culture, perhaps due to a life-sized reconstruction of the animal being featured at the 1964 World's Fair in New York City. Many traditional popular depictions show Ankylosaurus in a squatting posture and with a huge tail club being dragged over the ground. Modern reconstructions show the animal with a more upright limb posture and with the tail held off the ground. Likewise, large spines projecting sideways from the body (similar to those of nodosaurs) are present in many traditional depictions, but are not known from Ankylosaurus itself.|$|E

5|$|Penelope's {{story is}} an attempt at {{narrative}} justice to retribute Helen for her erroneously idealised image in the Odyssey as <b>the</b> <b>archetypal</b> female. Penelope acts like a judicial arbiter, a position she held in Ithaca {{as the head of}} state and, during Odysseus' absence, as head of the household. The ancient form of justice and punishment, which was swift and simple {{due to the lack of}} courts, prisons, and currency, is tempered by more modern concepts of balanced distributions of social benefits and burdens. Penelope's chosen form of punishment for Helen is to correct the historical records with her own bias by portraying her as vain and superficial, as someone who measures her worth by the number of men who died fighting for her.|$|E
5|$|Prince Rupert had {{a varied}} career. He {{was a soldier}} from a young age, {{fighting}} against Spain in the Netherlands during the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648), and against the Holy Roman Emperor in Germany during the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648). Aged 23, he was appointed commander of the Royalist cavalry during the English Civil War, becoming <b>the</b> <b>archetypal</b> Cavalier {{of the war and}} ultimately the senior Royalist general. He surrendered after the fall of Bristol and was banished from England. He served under Louis XIV of France against Spain, and then as a Royalist privateer in the Caribbean. Following the Restoration, Rupert returned to England, becoming a senior English naval commander during the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch wars, engaging in scientific invention, art, and serving as the first governor of the Hudson's Bay Company. Rupert died in England in 1682, aged 62.|$|E
5|$|The Bic Cristal (stylised as BIC Cristal; {{also known}} as the Bic pen) is an {{inexpensive}} disposable ballpoint pen mass-produced and sold by Société Bic of Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine, France.

50|$|Archetypal symbols vary {{more than}} {{archetype}} narratives or character types. <b>The</b> best <b>archetypal</b> pattern is any symbol with {{deep roots in}} a culture's mythology, such as the forbidden fruit in Genesis or even the poison apple in Snow White.

5|$|The first philosopher {{to outline}} these themes was Antisthenes, {{who had been}} a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BC. He was {{followed}} by Diogenes, who lived in a tub on the streets of Athens. Diogenes took Cynicism to its logical extremes, and came to be seen as <b>the</b> <b>archetypal</b> Cynic philosopher. He was followed by Crates of Thebes, who gave away a large fortune so he could live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens. Cynicism spread with the rise of the Roman Empire in the 1st century, and Cynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the empire. It finally disappeared in the late 5th century, although similar ascetic and rhetorical ideas appear in early Christianity.|$|E
5|$|In {{this stage}} of the myth, Horus is a {{vulnerable}} child beset by dangers. The magical texts that use Horus's childhood as the basis for their healing spells give him different ailments, from scorpion stings to simple stomachaches, adapting the tradition to fit the malady that each spell was intended to treat. Most commonly, the child god has been bitten by a snake, reflecting the Egyptians' fear of snakebite and the resulting poison. Some texts indicate that these hostile creatures are agents of Set. Isis may use her own magical powers to save her child, or she may plead with or threaten deities such as Ra or Geb, so they will cure him. As she is <b>the</b> <b>archetypal</b> mourner in the first portion of the story, so during Horus's childhood she is the ideal devoted mother. Through the magical healing texts, her efforts to heal her son are extended to cure any patient.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark {{is set in}} 2023 {{against the}} {{backdrop}} of an interstellar war between two races: the Maians, who resemble <b>the</b> <b>archetypal</b> grey alien, and the Skedar, reptile-like extraterrestrials who use a holographic disguise to appear as Scandinavian humans, bearing similarities to Nordic aliens. Using this disguise, they can interact with humans on Earth without looking too overtly suspicious. Meanwhile, on Earth, there is an ongoing rivalry between two factions: The Carrington Institute, a research and development center founded by Daniel Carrington that secretly operates an espionage group in league with the Maians; and dataDyne, a defence contractor corporation headed by Cassandra De Vries that secretly maintains a deal with the Skedar: in exchange for creating an AI capable of cracking an ancient alien spacecraft buried on the ocean floor, the Skedar have agreed to supply them with enough alien technology to become the biggest corporation on Earth.|$|E
50|$|Psychologist Carl Jung is {{credited}} with interpreting the alchemical process as analogous to modern-day psychoanalysis.
