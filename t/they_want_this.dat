25|$|Negotiators propose extreme measures, often bluffs, {{to force}} the other party to chicken out and give them what <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> <b>This</b> tactic can be {{dangerous}} when parties are unwilling to back down and go through with the extreme measure.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, the {{two teams}} agreed to {{schedule}} a rematch for September 6, 2010. Deborah Yow stated that, [...] "The citizens of Maryland {{have made it clear}} <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>this</b> game." [...] Alluding to the Navy athletic staff's perceived reticence, she added, [...] "We got past the Charlotte situation." [...] The delay in scheduling was attributed to the need for a three-way contract between Maryland, Navy, and the stadium tenants, the Baltimore Ravens. For this reason, a renewal as far off as 2014 was not seriously discussed. Ralph Friedgen said, [...] "I {{would like to see it}} as an annual game, but that's not for me to decide." ...|$|E
2500|$|Globalization is {{sometimes}} {{perceived as a}} cause of a phenomenon called the [...] "race to the bottom" [...] that implies that multinational companies are constantly attempting to maintain or increase their influence in countries that are already reliant on foreign investment alone. Multinationals tend to target export dependent countries. Due to a rise in competition, underdeveloped countries are undercutting their competitors through lowering their labor standards thus lowering the labor costs for the multinational companies investing into them. Companies will deliberately move into countries with the most relaxed laws and regulations for labor standards allowing them to do whatever <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> <b>This</b> results in factories with harsh labor conditions, low wages, and job insecurity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now you're saying {{something}} that I've been thinking right along," [...] answered Jack. [...] "Even if <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>this</b> {{place for a}} summer resort, it wouldn't bring any great sum of money." ...|$|R
5000|$|The new {{campaign}} again drew criticism, however Iggy Pop remained supportive, telling The Sunday Times: [...] "They said <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>this</b> series of ads {{to be performed}} by somebody… somebody you can’t help but like!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{release of}} the album and book was {{announced}} on 16 January 2006 on the official website of Epica. The band stated that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>this</b> album and book [...] "to {{be made for the}} fans, but also by the fans".|$|R
2500|$|Ed Power (The Independent) {{provided}} {{the group with}} a positive review stating, [...] "Backstreet also deserve credit for not over-indulging in the customary patronising patter you get from most pop acts. Instead of repetitive shout outs of, [...] "how you doing Dublin", the Boys simply churn out hit after hit without pausing for breath. Sure, they haven't re-invented the wheel musically, yet they prove in style that they've already left a considerable legacy of entertainment." [...] Vicki Kellaway (Liverpool Echo) gave the band a 10 out 10 remarking, [...] "They are utterly shameless. You might think four men {{with an average age}} of 32 (I’m sorry to remind you of that) would feel they are beyond the baggy jeans, printed hoodies, huge trainers and exaggerated ‘running man’ dance moves. Oh no. You might as well give a crowd what <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> <b>This</b> was not one of those we’ll-hit-you-with-our-new-material and throw in a medley for fun. It was pure nostalgia." ...|$|E
2500|$|Families {{were further}} angered after a May 20, 2014 black-tie, VIP {{cocktail}} party for donors at the museum. Among the 60 attendees were former mayor Michael Bloomberg {{and representatives of}} Condé Nast. Family members objected to a party near unidentified remains; the sister of victim Robert Shay, Jr. tweeted, [...] "Did you enjoy having drinks {{on top of my}} brother's grave last night?" [...] Shay and dozens of other visitors were angered that first responders were turned away from the museum the previous day while staff prepared for the party. She said, [...] "I am outraged that I can't visit my brother's final resting place without an appointment but people like Mike Bloomberg can wine and dine there whenever <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> <b>This</b> memorial and museum is sacred ground and last night it was desecrated." [...] A retired FDNY fire marshal said, [...] "You don't have cocktail parties at a cemetery." [...] A mid-2014 proposal to open a Danny Meyer restaurant in the museum was criticized.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{she makes}} many apologies for troubling you, but Tom {{is to be}} apprenticed to a grocer, and <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>this</b> fifteen pounds {{to make up the}} fee." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{divided the}} Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, [...] "I {{know a lot}} of our fans are puzzled by Zeitgeist. I think <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>this</b> massive, grandiose work, but you don't just roll out of bed after seven years without a {{functioning}} band and go back to doing that".|$|R
50|$|Kidston {{started his}} career in 1988, working for Douglas Jamieson at Coys of Kensington. Later, the classic car auctioneers Brooks asked him {{to start a new}} European division. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>this</b> to be based in Clapham, London, but he persuaded them that Geneva would be more appropriate. In 2005, he was {{president}} of Bonhams Europe.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it, Elspeth?" [...] Andrew's {{voice called}} from above. [...] "Who are these men {{you are talking}} to, and what do <b>they</b> <b>want</b> at <b>this</b> time of night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Object. 'I {{take it to}} be {{the highest}} act of {{friendship}} to be faithful to these professors, and to tell them <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>this</b> one thing in gospel order, which ought not to be left undone.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Money!" [...] cried Zeb Meader, [...] "I {{have found}} it pretty hard to git, but there's some things I won't do for it. There's a reason why <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>this</b> case hushed up, the way they've be'n actin'. I ain't lived in Mercer and Putnam County all my life for nothin'. Hain't I seen 'em run their dirty {{politics}} there under Brush Bascom for the last twenty-five years? There's no man has an office or a pass in that county but what Bascom gives it to him, and Bascom's the railrud tool." [...] Suddenly Zeb raised himself in bed. [...] "Hev' they be'n tamperin' with you?" [...] he demanded.|$|E
60|$|The English {{people are}} satisfied, {{that to the}} great the consolations of {{religion}} are as necessary as its instructions. They too are among the unhappy. They feel personal pain, and domestic sorrow. In these they have no privilege, but are subject to pay their full contingent to the contributions levied on mortality. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>this</b> sovereign balm under their gnawing cares and anxieties, which, being less conversant about the limited wants of animal life, range without limit, and are diversified by infinite combinations in the wild and unbounded regions of imagination. Some charitable dole is wanting to these, our often very unhappy brethren, to fill the gloomy void that reigns in minds which have nothing on earth to hope or fear; something to relieve in the killing languor and over-laboured lassitude {{of those who have}} nothing to do; something to excite an appetite to existence in the palled satiety which attends on all pleasures which may be bought, where nature is not left to her own process, where even desire is anticipated, and therefore fruition defeated by meditated schemes and contrivances of delight; and no interval, no obstacle, is interposed between the wish and the accomplishment.|$|E
60|$|Yet still {{this leaves}} many dissatisfied. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> to shout out about God. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> to share <b>this</b> great thing with all mankind.|$|R
60|$|Her mother--so self-possessed, and commonsensical--to {{look and}} speak like this! It was all frightening! Her father, her mother, herself! And {{only two months}} back they had seemed to have {{everything}} <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> in <b>this</b> world.|$|R

60|$|This rough but not ill-natured despotism {{lasted for}} {{little more than}} thirty years, and then in 1849, under the {{influence}} of the great upheaval of 1848, it was changed into a system of more popular and democratic build. The old Venetians, when for a couple of centuries they were masters in this region, laid it down that the islanders must be kept with their teeth drawn and their claws clipped. Bread and the stick, said Father Paul, that is what <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> <b>This</b> view prevailed at the colonial office, and maxims of Father Paul Sarpi's sort, incongruously combined with a paper constitution, worked as ill as possible. Mr. Gladstone always applied to the new system of 1849 Charles Buller's figure, of first lighting the fire and then stopping up the chimney. The stick may be wholesome, and local self-government may be wholesome, but in combination or rapid alternation they are apt to work nothing but mischief either in Ionian or any other islands. Sir Charles Napier--the Napier of Scinde--who had been Resident in Cephalonia thirty years before, in Byron's closing days, describes the richer classes as lively and agreeable; the women as having both beauty and wit, but of little education; the poor as hardy, industrious, and intelligent--all full of pleasant humour and vivacity, with a striking resemblance, says Napier, to his countrymen, the Irish. The upper class was mainly Italian in origin, and willingly threw all the responsibility for affairs on the British government. The official class, more numerous in proportion to population than in any country in Europe, scrambled for the petty salaries of paltry posts allotted by popular election. Since 1849 they had increased by twenty-five per cent., and were now one in a hundred of the inhabitants. The clergy in a passive way took part with the demagogues. Men of ability and sense were not wanting, but being unorganised, discouraged, and saturated with distrust, they made no effort to stem the jobbery, corruption, waste, going on around them. Roads, piers, aqueducts, and other monuments of the British protectorate reared before 1849, were falling to pieces. Taxes were indifferently collected. Transgressors of local law went unpunished. In ten years the deficit in the revenue had amounted to nearly £100,000, or two-thirds of a year's income. The cultivators of the soil figured in official reports as naturally well affected, and only wishing to grow their currants and their olives in peace and quietness. But they were extremely poor, and they were ignorant and superstitious, and being all these things it was inevitable that they should nurse discontent with their government. Whoever wanted their votes knew that the way to get them was to denounce the Englishman as [Greek: heterodoxos kai xenos], heretic, alien, and tyrant. There was a senate of six members, chosen by the high commissioner from the assembly. The forty-two members of the assembly met below galleries that held a thousand persons, and nothing made their seats and salaries so safe as round declamations from the floor to the audience above, on the greatness of the Hellenic race and the need for union with the Greek kingdom. The municipal officer in charge of education used to set as a copy for the children, a prayer that panhellenic concord might drive the Turks out of Greece and the English out of the seven islands.|$|E
5000|$|Users {{were able}} to test updates to {{software}} or new versions and [...] "rollback" [...] to previous versions if <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> <b>This</b> was especially effective if SLAX/BioSLAX was installed to a writable medium such as a USB drive.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} period of dual {{service on the}} Astoria and Flushing portions, IRT and BMT trains had their own {{stopping}} marks on the platforms and the sections of the platforms were separated. Passengers had separate entrances to the platforms depending on which service <b>they</b> <b>wanted.</b> <b>This</b> set-up prevented free transfers between the trains of the two companies. This arrangement had to end when the IRT lengthened trains. The two companies worked out an agreement in which the revenues collected on those stations were shared.|$|R
50|$|Rodriguez and Antal have {{expressed}} that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>this</b> film to be a sequel {{only to the}} original Predator (while not necessarily discounting Predator 2), as the film is trying to distance itself from the two Alien vs. Predator films. Antal stated the reasoning behind the decision to dismiss the Alien vs Predator films was that he wanted the film to be closer in tone to the original Predator film, as the AVP films had taken the Predator series in a too outlandish direction.|$|R
2500|$|In 2001 Environment Minister Michael Meacher {{claimed that}} the Government feared what an {{unrestricted}} inquiry might find, and that [...] "There was then {{a great deal of}} shenanigans about the terms of reference and fighting at all levels in order to limit the ambit of the committee to get the result <b>they</b> <b>wanted.</b> <b>This</b> inquiry was always potentially hugely damaging and hugely worrying to the establishment in terms of the way they handled the incident and clearly there are elements that want to shut it down." [...] No named individuals were ever prosecuted.|$|R
50|$|A typical program {{begins with}} a 90-minute segment called Get It Off Your Chest, a less serious show in which callers are invited to call the station to discuss {{whatever}} <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> <b>This</b> section includes phone, text-in competitions and callers to the show randomly winning small prizes.|$|E
50|$|Another {{alternative}} to grinding {{is to remove}} designer-defined objectives, leaving players free to do whatever <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> <b>This</b> creates a new problem where many players might be confused {{about what they are}} supposed to do, or they might lack the motivation to do much of anything in the virtual world.|$|E
5000|$|Iraqi Interim Government Investigation: Iraqi {{official}} Sami al-Araji {{reported on}} the Iraqi government's investigation into the theft, indicating that the looters [...] "came in with the cranes and the lorries, and they depleted the whole sites. They {{knew what they were}} doing; they knew what <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> <b>This</b> was sophisticated looting." ...|$|E
60|$|So Rollo {{went and}} {{reported}} to his uncle George, and they together went {{in pursuit of}} the Swiss. They soon came to the great gate; and just inside of it they saw a man dressed in a long red gown which came down to his ankles. This proved to be what they called the Swiss. On making known to him what <b>they</b> <b>wanted,</b> <b>this</b> man gave them a ticket,--they paying him the usual fee for it,--and then went and found a guide who was to show them up into the galleries.|$|R
5000|$|The song {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews. [...] "Memórias Futuras" [...] said: [...] "It {{is impossible to}} not like this voice! People can say whatever <b>they</b> <b>want,</b> but <b>this</b> is pure talent, it doesn't need arrangements! Everything we need is there!".|$|R
500|$|The band's new album, Zeitgeist, was {{released}} that same month on Reprise Records, entering the Billboard charts at number two and selling 145,000 copies {{in its first}} week. Zeitgeist received mixed reviews, {{with much of the}} criticism targeted at the absence of half of the original lineup. The album divided the Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, [...] "I know a lot of our fans are puzzled by Zeitgeist. I think <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>this</b> massive, grandiose work, but you don't just roll out of bed after seven years without a functioning band and go back to doing that".|$|R
5000|$|... “The {{petition}} {{would be}} to allow the state’s people to vote {{on whether or not}} <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>this</b> kind of casino gambling in the state,” he said. “....

5000|$|Adolescent {{children}} are usually segregated in school by sex, because <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>this</b> to {{be a place}} for education and not entertainment or romance. Thinking that sex education would lead to desire and trouble. [...] The main exception to this occurs during festivals, especially the New Year Festival, when boys and girls take part in group games.|$|E
5000|$|... “Complete Vocal Technique,” or CVT, is {{an internationally}} {{widespread}} method for teaching voice. CVT {{is divided into}} four main principles, and by combining parts of these principles singers can produce the sounds <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> <b>This</b> also {{makes it possible to}} pinpoint and correct specific problems and errors without having to change the parts the singer are happy with.|$|E
30|$|A final {{deviation}} {{comes in}} the explicit call by CIMULACT for research into utilizing data and analysis {{as a mode of}} “participating in collective decisions.” Citizens it seemed were not just interested in accessing data, and learning how to conduct analysis, but <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>this</b> mode of input to foster agency in social and political processes. This research strand found little resonance within the expert studies, and yet serves to orient the rest of the CIMULACT research topic towards a broader, and perhaps more meaningful, goal with respect to the relationship between the citizenry and governance.|$|R
5000|$|A {{referendum}} on the Islamisation policy of President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq was held in Pakistan on 19 December 1984. Voters were asked whether they supported Zia-ul-Haq's proposals for amending several laws {{in accordance with the}} Quran and Sunnah, whether <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>this</b> process to continue, and whether they supported the Islamic ideology of Pakistan. The referendum also served as way of extending Zia-ul-Haq's presidential term by five years. Official results declared it approved by 98.5% of voters, with a turnout of 62.2%. Independent observers questioned whether voter participation had reached 30% and noted that there had been [...] "widespread irregularities".|$|R
5000|$|It's {{because of}} Fritzthat they're going after Mighty Mouse. I {{grew up in}} Brownsville in Brooklyn and {{attended}} High School for Industrial Arts. I remember teachers who quit. Because of McCarthyism they weren't able to teach what <b>they</b> <b>wanted.</b> <b>This</b> is the same thing. Mighty Mouse was happy after smelling the flowers because it helped him remember {{the little girl who}} sold it to him fondly. But even if you're right, their accusations become part of the air we breathe. That's why I cut the scene. I can't have children wondering if Mighty Mouse is using cocaine. Ralph Bakshi ...|$|R
