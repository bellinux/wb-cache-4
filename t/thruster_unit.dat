50|$|The Protea is a {{specialist}} hydrographic survey vessel, although its equipment {{has been used}} in search and rescue operations using the Protea’s shallow water route survey system (SWRSS). She is the only ship in the South African Navy that is painted white, denoting that she is not a warship. Her hull is strengthened for navigation in ice and she is fitted with a transverse bow <b>thruster</b> <b>unit,</b> for increased manoeuvrability in harbour.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a couple}} of {{propulsion}} techniques for AUVs. Some of them use a brushed or brush-less electric motor, gearbox, Lip seal, and a propeller which may be surrounded by a nozzle or not. All of these parts embedded in the AUV construction are involved in propulsion. Other vehicles use a <b>thruster</b> <b>unit</b> to maintain the modularity. Depending on the need, the thruster may be equipped with a nozzle for propeller collision protection or to reduce noise submission, or it may be equipped with a direct drive thruster to keep the efficiency at the highest level and the noises at the lowest level. Advanced AUV thrusters have a redundant shaft sealing system to guarantee a proper seal of the robot even if one of the seals fails during the mission.|$|E
50|$|The {{propulsion}} system consists of six <b>thruster</b> <b>units,</b> three forward and three aft, each with variable-pitch propellers and 1760-kW motors. The electricity for the motors {{is provided by}} diesel generators.|$|R
50|$|The Soderman has two General Electric LM2500 gas {{turbines}} that make 64,000BHP and drive two 24’ controllable pitch propellers that turn at 95 RPM at full power. The ship has {{the capability of}} making 12,500 KW of electrical power for shipboard use. The emergency generator has a 2,000 KW capacity. The design speed of the ship is 24 knots {{with a range of}} 13,800 miles. The ship has bow <b>thruster</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
50|$|However, new {{problems}} emerge, such as interaction with strong magnetic fields and thermal management. The relatively large power at which VASIMR operates generates substantial waste heat {{that needs to}} be channeled away without creating thermal overload and thermal stress. Powerful superconducting electromagnets, necessary to contain hot plasma, generate tesla-range magnetic fields that can cause problems with other onboard devices and produce unwanted torque by interaction with the magnetosphere. To counter this latter effect, the VF-200 consists of two 100 kW <b>thruster</b> <b>units</b> packaged with magnetic fields oriented in opposite directions, making a net zero-torque magnetic quadrupole.|$|R

50|$|While {{based on}} the same design principles, this suit's matrix was formed non-collapsible to {{increase}} its protection from the rigors of deep space; also, its specialized nature made collapsibility unnecessary. Power was provided by a Mk IV micro-nuclear supply pack, supplemented by solar power converters. Systems were controlled via a cybernetic interface, though it proved to be overly sensitive; when Stark first used the armor he had difficulty triggering the appropriate command to activate the feature he wanted. The suit was designed for extended time outside of the atmosphere, up to two days in orbit (food and catheterization capable). The life support, boot jets and altitude maneuvering were powered by an on-board supply of liquid oxygen. Weaponry consisted of palm-mounted third-generation Repulsors (electron beams which require laser ionized path of air to travel through the atmosphere; the beam is moderated using a pulsing beam and early form of adaptive optics; objects are jolted away from the beam path by the combination of ionized air and the accelerated neutron beam) and a chest-mounted Unibeam (a variable intensity light source usable as a spotlight or a laser; the pentagonal shape of the emitter allowed for more accurate laser pulsing while in an atmosphere), and epaulet-mounted concussion-burst cannons. Sensors consisted of radar, sonar, infrared scanners, and radio. Additional features included ECM against radar and sonar, and the fully articulated hands could be fired out on retractable cables for use as long-range grapples. The most obvious feature on this special armor was its ability to attain escape velocity without aid of an external thruster, unique to this Iron Man version; however, the nuclear jets which allowed this made the suit bulky, heavy and awkward in Earth's gravity. The dangers inherent in an atomic-energy based propulsion system of such immense power seem to have driven Stark to build the <b>thruster</b> <b>unit</b> which he has been using ever since.|$|E
40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of the study is}} in {{transient}} torque vibration due to ice excitation on propulsion machinery components but some background for ice class rules is also presented generally. It is studied how the ice classification calculation process for propeller units could be done more automatically and how sensitive the process is to different parameters. Additionally aspects of the upcoming rule updates are discussed. These updates try to harmonize the ice class calculations internationally and bring out alternatives for the calculation process. As a part of this study partly automated calculation process was developed with Matlab as a sales team tool to ease the preliminary calculations that have to be made during the sales offer. The program includes simulation of a <b>thruster</b> <b>unit</b> and gear calculations based on the given input parameters. This kind of a tool is needed because the offered thruster needs to be classified accordingly and on the current rules this is the safest way to ensure that the offered values can be achieved. The program was developed for a single <b>thruster</b> <b>unit</b> using Finnish-Swedish ice class rules and marine gear rating rules. First in the program ice class excitation loads are calculated and simulated. Then the gears are evaluated to find out validity of power for the chosen <b>thruster</b> <b>unit.</b> This program can be applied to other units as well by making the necessary changes to the propeller unit’s simulation model and by changing the mass-elastic data. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted for Rolls-Royce US 305 azimuthing <b>thruster</b> <b>unit.</b> The results showed that the most critical factor is the gear design itself because it needs to be optimized for heavy loads and the current designs are based on the free running conditions. Other design factors influence the resulting maximum power as well and may have significance cumulatively but otherwise their effect is minimal compared to the gears. Flexible coupling is also quite critical component because of the damping properties and its effect on systems nominal frequencies. Higher power can be achieved by choosing a lower inertia engine or motor and choosing a lower input speed. Additionally propeller design parameters like pitch have some effects but the most important factor is the choice between open and ducted propeller. Open propellers have notably higher loads than ducted in the rules. Other important factor in the design is the propeller diameter, bigger diameter increases the ice load...|$|E

40|$|A {{previous}} work at Royal IHC, following the observation from sea trials of trailing suction hopper dredgers (TSHD) that the turning performance of bow tunnel thrusters significantly reduced at slow forward speeds, studied the flow behaviour {{and performance of}} bow tunnel thrusters at slow forward speeds using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Simulations were performed, on model scale, first with a simplified wedge model of a containership {{and then with a}} simplified wedge model of a TSHD with the thruster modelled by an actuator disk. The numerical results deviated significantly from experimental results from literature. The present work aims to investigate this deviation. Simulations are also performed with a full <b>thruster</b> <b>unit</b> to compare with the actuator disk approach. Also, possible improvement in thruster effectivity is explored by altering the tunnel geometry of the TSHD wedge. First, a grid convergence study is performed on the containership wedge. Next, simulations are carried out for a range of forward speeds - for selected thrusts for the actuator disk approach, and corresponding rpm’s for those thrusts for a full <b>thruster</b> <b>unit.</b> In case of the actuator disk approach, the numerical results show a steady increase of transverse force (Fy) with increasing forward speed, contrary to observations in sea trials. The circulation around the wedge, resulting from interaction of the jet from the tunnel and the cross-flow due to the forward speed, results in the wedge to behave as a slender body in a flow. This results in a transverse force, analogous to Kutta-Joukowski lift, that results in increased Fy. A full <b>thruster</b> <b>unit</b> in place of the actuator disk result in a different flow behaviour and variation of Fy with forward speed. In this case, an initial decline in Fy is observed before it increases monotonically. Comparison with experimental result of the containership wedge and numerical results by both actuator disk and <b>thruster</b> <b>unit</b> show considerable deviation. The transverse force due to the circulation around the hull presents a plausible explanation. The conclusions from the grid convergence study for the containership model are utilized in meshing the TSHD wedge. Simulations performed for a range of forward speeds, first with actuator disk approximation, indicated lowered thruster performance as was observed in sea trials. The pressure contours over the hull imply that the resultant of the forces around the inlet – due to low pressure caused by high velocities of the flow into the tunnel – and those around the outlet – due to low pressure caused by high velocities of outflow – is such that there is a net thrust deduction. Simulations with <b>thruster</b> <b>unit</b> also show lowered thruster effectivity. The tunnel of the TSHD wedge is then given a forward bend of 45 o at the tunnel inlet and outlet in order to explore the possibility of improving thruster performance. It is expected that the changed geometry will result in better inflow at tunnel inlet, and the action of the cross-flow on the jet will result in a ‘straightened’ jet with lesser interaction with the hull compared to a jet from a straight tunnel. The CFD results, with actuator disk approximation, indicate that thruster effectivity improves in case of higher forward speeds and reduces for lower speeds. It is advisable to perform the study with smaller tunnel bending angles such that the jet-flow interaction is favourable for the entire range of speeds.

40|$|The DelFFi mission’s {{satellites}} {{employ a}} variety of subsystems, whose temperature ranges need be controlled. Thermal design for DelFFi is challenging because of its body mounted solar cells and high heat dissipation internal components, such as the thruster and inter-satellite link device. The goal of this thesis was summarized in the research question: Is it possible, and if so how, for the DelFFi satellites' temperatures {{to be controlled by}} passive means? The answer to this question was found through thermal modelling, testing and thermal control system designs. A detailed thermal model was created in ESATAN-TMS software. To verify critical model parameters, a set of 7 component level tests was performed. PC/ 104 conduction and mid-plane stand-off conduction in particular proved to be critical model data, with a significant deviation from their calculated theoretical values. With use of the model, three different thermal control system designs were made. All designs employ very low conductivity spacers and stand-off's, to reduce coupling with the cold structure. Also, a combination of aluminium, Kapton and tarnished copper thermal tapes are used. Concluded was that the batteries and the <b>thruster</b> <b>unit</b> were the thermally critical subsystems. The battery temperature range cannot be made small enough by passive means only, so it is advised to employ a heater for safety. The <b>thruster</b> <b>unit</b> propellant should be allowed to freeze, or its freezing point should be reduced by the use of ammonia or alcohol. With these adaptations to the thruster and battery, the thermal requirements of the satellites are met. This confirms that with these measures a working thermal control system can be implemented on the DelFFi satellites. Space Systems EngineeringSpace FlightAerospace Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} three innovative concepts for {{a mobile}} lunar base. These concept combine design research for habitat architecture, mobility systems, habitability, radiation protection, human factors, and {{living and working}} environments on the lunar surface. The mobile lunar base presents several key advantages over conventional static base notions. These advantages concern landing zone safety, the requirement to move modules over the lunar surface, {{and the ability to}} stage mobile reconnaissance with effective systemic redundancy. All of these concerns lead to the consideration of a mobile walking habitat module and base design. The key issues involve landing zone safety, the ability to transport habitat modules across the surface, and providing reliability and redundancy to exploration traverses in pressurized vehicles.

40|$|Open water {{tests of}} propellers, pod units and {{thruster}} units are usually {{performed in a}} steady manner where the forward velocity and propeller rotation rate are constant during each measurement. It can require {{a considerable amount of}} time in the towing tank to complete an open water diagram with this method. Therefore, a faster method is proposed which applies a quasi-steady approach; the forward velocity of the towing carriage is varied while the thrust and torque are measured continuously. With this method, the normal open water diagram (J= 0 to KT = 0) can be determined in one single run through the towing tank instead of multiple runs. This quasi-steady open water (QSO) procedure greatly reduces the time required to perform open water model tests. The method has been tested at MARIN. During those tests, it was seen that there are hysteresis effects on the raw data, but those can be negated by taking the average of the accelerating and the decelerating halves of the measurement.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{use of an}} Inertial Electrostatic Confinement (IEC) {{power source}} for space propulsion has previously been suggested by the authors and others. In the past, these discussions have generally followed the charged-particle electric-discharge engine (QED) concept proposed by Bussard, in which the IEC is used to generate an electron beam which vaporizes liquid hydrogen {{for use as a}} propellant. However, in the present study, we consider an alternate approach, using the IEC to drive a conventional electric <b>thruster</b> <b>unit.</b> This has the advantage of building on the rapidly developing technology for such thrusters, which operate at higher specific impulse. Key issues related to this approach include the continued successful development of the physics and engineering of the IEC unit, as well as the development of efficient step-down dc voltage transformers. The IEC operates by radial injection of energetic ions into a spherical vessel. A very high ion density is created in a small core region {{at the center of the}} vessel, resulting in extremely high fusion power density in the core. Present experiments at the U. of Illinois in small IEC devices (less than 60 -cm. dia.) have demonstrated much of the basic physics underlying this concept, e. g. producing approximately 10 (exp 6) D-D neutrons/sec steady-state with deuterium gas flow injection. The ultimate goal is to increase the power densities by several orders of magnitude and to convert to D-He- 3 injection. If successful, such an experiment would represent a milestone proof-of-principle device for eventual space power use. Further discussion of IEC physics and status will be presented with a description of the overall propulsion system and estimated performance...|$|E
40|$|In {{the desire}} to solve some of the {{challenges}} in personal transport and congestions in the cities, an investigation in to the specifications of a thruster based solution for hovering capabilities of a personal transport drone concept, has been conducted in this thesis. Also, a scaled test rig for evaluation and experimentation of propulsive function for a thruster was developed. The work in this thesis {{is presented in two}} parts, with the first part involving investigation for the drone concept, and the second part containing development and specifications of the experimental test rig. To evaluate the required specifications for a thruster design, a literature review of aerodynamics was conducted, starting with basic concepts and terms. Further, a review of propulsive theory within propellers and rotors were done. Existing and future concepts were also evaluated for inspiration and as a reference. The findings in theory, specifically blade element theory were implemented in a simplified theoretical tool. This tool was applied to the specification process to determine requirements in power, weight, and efficiency one can expect to lift and hover a payload that includes one person with in-built redundancy for safety. Next, a scaled experimental setup is developed to lay the foundation for future development of a full-scale thruster that can meet the requirements found {{in the first part of}} the thesis. The investigation in part one of this thesis laid the foundation for the development of the experimental test rig in Part Two. The development of the test rig, could not be done without the investigation and development of theoretical tools in Part One. The specification of the <b>thruster</b> <b>unit</b> in Part One was done under a regime of objectives that managed the specification process so that important properties such as safety and efficiency were maintained throughout the concept generation. The specification in Part One led to a selected layout of the thrusters through the use of development methodology with its origins from Pugh’s method. The preliminary specifications include a goal for efficiency, performance, total weight of the aircraft, and power requirements. Since the nature of the theory used in this thesis is ideal, the specifications in Part One are preliminary only. Also, using only the thrusters for generation of lift, requires a very high power consumption. The same development methodology was used in Part Two where key properties of the experimental test rig were defined and several concepts were generated and screened in a two-cycle process that yielded a best concept. This concept was constructed in CAD with full specifications and simulated for flow analysis. The main findings in Part One were the following: Assuming a gross weight of 450 kg, a <b>thruster</b> <b>unit</b> with two coaxial contra-rotating propellers will require a power of 50 kW and a total swept area of 2. 26 m 2. This gives a specific weight of 2. 25 kg/kW. The minimum power required for hovering is 18 kW for each thruster. For Part Two the results are: An experimental test rig for measuring thrust and torque produced by a propeller is designed with full specifications and technical drawings for a total cost of 595 000 NOK. A simple experimental plan overviewing method and experimental equipment is also found in this report. The rig is 1500 mm long, 1000 mm wide and 890 mm high without the propeller. Total weight is 29 kg. The test rig is optimized for the specified engine of 1 kW and the designed propeller of 600 mm, but is also capable of handling up to 3 kW of power, and up to 800 mm diameter propellers. The main challenge for future work, is to develop a dedicated program or code including vortex theory to accurately predict performance and generate design parameters for the propeller blades. This program should also be able to predict characteristics in forward flight. Also, an investigation in to how a wing area can be implemented in the drone/aircraft design to improve efficiency is recommended...|$|E

The envisaged arrangement of FEEP thrusters {{in all of the}} near-term missions is in “clusters” of two or three ion emitters. Due to constraints on thrust vector orientation and available room, very close packing of emitters is foreseen. While several test results are available on the behaviour and performance of single ion sources and prototype <b>thruster</b> <b>units,</b> the design and testing issues arising from the combined operation of a multi-thruster assembly were never thoroughly addressed, nor was the assessment of potential interaction effects that may impair the thruster performance. A two-emitters test was therefore recently carried out to assess possible interactions between incident ion beams from adjacent thrusters. A pair of identical, 5 -mm linear slit FEEP emitters, was integrated in Alta’s IV 1 vacuum facility. The two emitters’ slits were mounted parallel to each other at a distance of 10 cm. The ion beam density was evaluated using a set of single-filament Langmuir probes immersed in the thrusters’ plume. It was observed that the beam profile resulting from combined operation is essentially coincident with the sum of the individual profiles, as indicated by a numerical plume simulation of the test configuration run using Alta’s proprietary 3 -D code. The experiment shows that there is no significant interaction between the overlapping plumes, thus demonstrating the feasibility of closely-packed clusters of FEEP emitters...|$|R
50|$|Ion {{thrusters}} are an {{enabling technology}} for SSP Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to Geostationary Orbit (GEO) orbit transfer and station keeping. Studies showed that advanced electric propulsion {{can provide a}} factor of 5 increase in payload for Earth to orbit transfer when compared to storable biprop and cryogenic biprop thrusters; payload mass that normally would be manifested for propellant. Comparisons made to gridded ion thrusters, magnetoplasmadynamic and pulsed inductive thrusters showed that Hall thruster technology provides overall greater benefits, including quicker trip times, good power density, a good contemporary technology base and good flight history, all translating into commercial industry acceptance. Advances such as direct power drive from the solar arrays and single and/or two-stage operation will allow payloads of 13 to 15 metric tons per 20 metric tons to LEO from launch as opposed to only 2 metric tons using chemical propulsion. Trip times from LEO to GEO are also reasonable at 120 to 230 days depending on performance setpoint. The proposed Hall thruster system consisted of four 50 kW krypton Hall thrusters directly driven from a 200 kW solar array. The propulsion system will be included on each SSP segment. Performance required from the Hall <b>thruster</b> <b>units</b> is 2000 to 3500 sec ISP with an overall system efficiency of 52% to 57%. Due to the mass of fuel required to place the entire system into geostationary orbit, propellants besides xenon (normally used), such as krypton and noble gas mixtures were proposed. Additional work on alternative fuels would eventually need to be conducted.|$|R
40|$|Nuclear-electric {{propulsion}} {{can significantly}} reduce the launch mass for manned Mars missions. By using high-specific-impulse (lsp) electric propulsion systems with advanced nuclear reactors, the total mass-to-orbit {{for a series of}} manned Mars flight is reduced. Propulsion technologies required for the manned Mars mission are described. Multi-megawatt Ion and Magneto-Plasma-Dynamic (MPD) propulsion <b>thrusters,</b> Power-Processing <b>Units</b> and nuclear power source are needed. Xenon (Xe) -Ion and MPD thruster performance are detailed. Mission analyses for several Mars mission options are addressed. Both MPD and Ion propulsion were investigated. A four-megawatt propulsion system power level was assumed. Mass comparisons for all-chemical oxygen/hydrogen propulsion missions and combined chemical and nuclear-electric propulsion Mars fleets are included. With fleets of small nuclear-electric vehicles, short trip times to Mars are also enabled...|$|R
