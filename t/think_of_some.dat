500|$|Jagger and Richards {{shared an}} admiration of Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and Little Walter, which {{influenced}} Brian Jones, of whom Richards says, [...] "He was more into T-Bone Walker and jazz blues stuff. We'd turn him onto Chuck Berry and say, 'Look, it's {{all the same}} shit, man, {{and you can do}} it.'" [...] Charlie Watts, a traditional jazz drummer, [...] was also introduced to the blues through his association with the pair. [...] "Keith and Brian turned me on to Jimmy Reed and people like that. I learned that Earl Phillips was playing on those records like a jazz drummer, playing swing, with a straight four." [...] Jagger, recalling when he first heard the likes of Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Fats Domino, and other major American R artists, said it [...] "seemed the most real thing" [...] he had heard up to that point. Similarly, Keith Richards, describing the first time he listened to Muddy Waters, said it was the [...] "most powerful music [...] ever heard... the most expressive." [...] He also stated, [...] "when you <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> dopey, spotty seventeen year old from Dartford, who wants to be Muddy Waters—and {{there were a lot of}} us—in a way, very pathetic, but in another way, very... heartwarming".|$|E
2500|$|Babur {{still wanted}} {{to escape from the}} Uzbeks, and he chose India as a refuge instead of Badakhshan, which was to the north of Kabul. He wrote, [...] "In the {{presence}} of such power and potency, we had to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> place for ourselves and, at this crisis and in the crack of time there was, put a wider space between us and the strong foeman." [...] After his third loss of Samarkand, Babur gave full attention to the conquest of North India, launching a campaign; he reached Chenab, now in Pakistan, in 1519. Until 1524, his aim was to only expand his rule to Punjab, mainly to fulfill the legacy of his ancestor Timur, since it used to be part of his empire. At the time parts of north India were under the rule of Ibrahim Lodi of the Lodi dynasty, but the empire was crumbling and there were many defectors. He received invitations from Daulat Khan Lodi, Governor of Punjab and Ala-ud-Din, uncle of Ibrahim. He sent an ambassador to Ibrahim, claiming himself the rightful heir to the throne, but the ambassador was detained at Lahore and released months later.|$|E
2500|$|Flanders {{returned}} to the family home in Hampstead Garden Suburb. He directed and produced plays with a local amateur theatre group and arranged small musical gatherings with other amateurs of music, including Gerard Hoffnung and Frank Hauser. A stage acting career being no longer possible, he found work as a radio broadcaster and wrote a few song lyrics. At the same time, Swann began composing music for revues. He recalled in 1974, [...] "We wrote our first song {{in the summer of}} 1948. I'd gone over to Michael's home near Hampstead Heath {{to see if he could}} <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> words for a tune I'd written … 'It all sounds a bit like Gilbert and Sullivan, don't you think? … It must be terribly boring in the D'Oyly Carte Company, having to do everything exactly as it always has been done – Idea!" [...] The resulting trio, [...] "In the D'Oyly Cart" [...] , for three disgruntled Savoyards, was accepted by the producer Laurier Lister for his new show Oranges and Lemons. The revue and the trio were highly successful, and Lister commissioned further work from the pair for his next production, Penny Plain (1951). [...] Among their contributions to the latter were [...] "Prehistoric Complaint", a solo for Max Adrian, [...] "dressed in bits of fur as a sort of mis-fit caveman", and [...] "Surly Girls", with Adrian, Desmond Walter-Ellis and Jimmy Thompson as a trio [...] of appalling St Trinian's schoolgirls.|$|E

50|$|Before {{the current}} general {{definition}} of topological space, {{there were many}} definitions offered, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> which assumed (what we now <b>think</b> <b>of</b> as) <b>some</b> separation axioms.
