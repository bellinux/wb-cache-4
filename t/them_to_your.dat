His impact on the sport went beyond his rebounding titles, assists, scoring and physical play. His confrontational mannerisms often led to technical fouls and fines on the court, and his larger than life persona sometimes gave rise to national controversy off of it, such as when he was featured in ads that rejected pro athletes as role models and declared, [...] "I am not a role model." [...] Although his words often led to controversy, according to Barkley his mouth was never the cause because it always spoke the truth. He stated, [...] "I don't create controversies. They're there long before I open my mouth. I just bring <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> attention." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2010, Autumn {{released}} the acronym of her upcoming album, F.L.A.G., on her Twitter account, before revealing the full title as Fight Like a Girl. In her words, the meaning behind {{the title is}} [...] "about taking {{all these things that}} make women the underdogs and using <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> advantage". Based on her fictional novel, The Asylum for Wayward Victorian Girls, the album has been described as [...] "an operatic feminist treatise set inside an insane asylum, wherein the female inmates gradually realize their own strength in numbers". On August 30, 2010, she announced that she would be undergoing jaw surgery, and recovered from it. In September 2011, she posted the full lyrics to the album's title track, [...] "Fight Like a Girl", on her Twitter account. Autumn appeared at the 2011 Harvest Festival in Australia, and had planned to debut two songs from Fight Like a Girl during those performances. On April 11, 2012, Autumn {{released the}} single [...] "Fight Like a Girl", with the song [...] "Time for Tea" [...] appearing as a B-side.|$|E

"Dr Sentamu's sermon was a stern lecture to the Church of England to {{grow out}} of being a 'judgmental and moralising' {{congregation}} of 'pew-fillers, sermon-taters, Bible readers, even born-again believers and Spirit-filled charismatics' and go out to make friends in the world. 'We have lost the joy and power that makes real disciples and we've become consumers of religion, not disciples of Jesus-Christ', he said. 'Christians, go and make friends among Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, agnostics, atheists, not {{for the purpose of}} converting <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> beliefs but for friendship, understanding, listening, hearing.' His remarks were greeted with applause, not with silence as the order of the service instructed." ...|$|E

Wayne {{was one of the}} few people who brought music to Miles that didn't get changed." [...] Davis said, [...] "Wayne is a real composer. He writes scores, write the parts for {{everybody}} just as he wants them to sound. ... Wayne also brought in a kind of curiosity about working with musical rules. If they didn't work, then he broke them, but with musical sense; he understood that freedom in music was the ability to know the rules in order to bend <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> own satisfaction and taste." ...|$|E

Throughout his opinion, they are spoken of as rights belonging to the individual as a citizen of a State....The constitutional provision there alluded to did not create those rights....It threw around them in that clause no security for the citizen of the State in which they were claimed or exercised. Nor did it profess to control the power of the State governments over the rights of its own citizens. Its sole purpose was to declare to the several States, that whatever those rights, as you grant or establish <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> own citizens, or as you limit or qualify, or impose restrictions on their exercise, the same, neither more nor less, shall be the measure of the rights of citizens of other States within your jurisdiction.

2500|$|The musical {{originally}} {{relied on}} heavy prosthetics and elaborate costumes {{in an attempt}} to make the musical resemble the film as closely as possible. In an attempt to replicate the film's famous movie poster, Egan was dressed in flats while Mann was positioned on stilts to establish a more dramatic height difference. According to Egan, the studio [...] "didn't trust the audience's ability to suspend disbelief, something theater-goers are routinely asked to do." [...] However, the company finally began to relent as the production neared Houston tryouts after a final run-through during which the actors did not wear costumes; thus, the prosthetics were gradually lessened and replaced by make up for the Beast and enchanted objects during 1993 previews. The elaborate costumes resulted in their fair share of technical difficulties, malfunctions and performance restrictions, many of which manifested during the seven-week tryouts in Houston. The costumes left little room for the performers to change between scenes, and air conditioners were fastened to them to regulate their temperatures. In general, the weight of the enchanted objects' costumes limited their dancing. Chiropractors and therapists remained on standby to assist Fowler, whose Mrs. Potts costume required her to always keep one arm in the air. Beach compared holding up the two propane tanks used to represent Lumiere's candles to carrying two hams around a grocery store two and a half hours. To build his stamina, Beach would carry the tanks during rehearsal. Beach's hand caught fire during one performance, which he did not notice until Mann subtly pointed it out using [...] "furtive head nods". While dancing, the inertia of Egan's heavy ballgown caused its skirt to constantly pull her in the opposite direction of whichever way she turned. Mann likened performing in the Beast's costume to wearing several heavy winter coats, comparing the wig to [...] "four Angora cats and gaffer taping <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> head and then running around the block 10 or 12 times." [...] Disney was outraged when, after their first performance at the Palace Theatre, The New York Times published caricaturist Al Hirschfeld's line drawing interpretation of Belle and the Beast's pose, in which Belle's yellow gown was colored pink, and the Beast's tuxedo appeared greenish as opposed to royal blue. When Disney confronted Hirschfeld, the artist defended his work, explaining, [...] "The costumes may have been blue and yellow, but they made me feel green and pink." [...] Hould-Ward adjusted the costumes to accommodate the locations as the production traveled to various theaters.|$|E
