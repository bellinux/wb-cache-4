5|$|Although early humans {{gathered}} uncultivated {{plant materials}} {{for food and}} employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing, most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. <b>The</b> <b>clearance</b> of large tracts of land for crop growth {{has led to a}} significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.|$|E

There was no {{equivalent of the}} English system of copyhold, which provided a heritable tenancy for many English counterparts of the Scots who were cleared from their farms. The cumulative effect of <b>the</b> <b>Clearances,</b> and <b>the</b> large-scale voluntary emigrations over the same period, devastated the cultural landscape of Scotland; the effect of <b>the</b> <b>Clearances</b> was to destroy much of the Gaelic culture.|$|R
50|$|Fraser was, {{like many}} other landlords in Scotland, notorious for his {{contribution}} to <b>the</b> Highland <b>Clearances,</b> during which tenants were evicted so the land could become available for large-scale sheep farming.

In the 1950s the nearby villages of Combe Down, Twerton and Weston were incorporated into the city to enable the development of housing, much of it council housing. In the 1970s and 1980s it was recognised that conservation of historic buildings was inadequate, leading to more care and reuse of buildings and open spaces. In 1987 the city was selected by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, recognising its international cultural significance.|$|E

40|$|The {{intestinal}} {{absorption of}} analgesic peptides (leucine enkephalin and kyotorphin) and modified peptides in rat were studied. Although these peptides were not absorbed, <b>the</b> absorbability (absorption <b>clearance)</b> of these peptides were {{increased in the}} presence of peptidase inhibitors. In order to kinetically analyze these phenomena, we proposed the metabolic inhibition model, which incorporated <b>the</b> metabolic <b>clearance</b> (metabolizability) with <b>the</b> absorption <b>clearance.</b> Metabolic activity was determined with intestinal homogenates. The higher <b>the</b> metabolic <b>clearance</b> was, <b>the</b> lower was <b>the</b> absorption <b>clearance.</b> <b>The</b> relationships between <b>the</b> absorption <b>clearance</b> and <b>the</b> metabolic <b>clearance</b> of <b>the</b> experimental data {{as well as of the}} theoretical values were hyperbolic.

5|$|East Germany's {{communities}} had a {{much harder}} time, because the country was poorer and their government imposed severe restrictions on them. The border region was progressively depopulated through <b>the</b> <b>clearance</b> of numerous villages and the forced relocation of their inhabitants. Border towns suffered draconian building restrictions: inhabitants were forbidden from building new houses and even repairing existing buildings, causing infrastructure to fall into severe decay. The state did little but to provide a 15% income supplement to those living in the Sperrzone and Schutzstreifen; but this did not halt the shrinkage of the border population, as younger people moved elsewhere to find employment and better living conditions.|$|E
5|$|M.I.A.'s debut studio album, Arular, was {{initially}} {{scheduled to be}} released in September 2004, but the release was delayed by six months due to problems with <b>the</b> <b>clearance</b> of samples used in the songs. She released two singles and a mixtape in the interim. Although the album had limited commercial success, it was highly regarded by music critics for its blending of genres such as grime, hip hop, ragga and Brazilian baile funk, and for its politicised lyrics. Music magazines in the United States and Europe included it in lists of the best albums of the year, and it was nominated for the Mercury Prize in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} four years all three of the regiment's {{operational}} squadrons eventually served in Vietnam, providing invaluable close support to the infantry, particularly during <b>the</b> <b>clearance</b> of Viet Cong bunker systems. Although their value in Vietnam was originally questioned by some, they proved a powerful weapon in both offence and defence, and were responsible for limiting infantry casualties. The Centurions were able to move through the countryside more easily than expected and although they were vulnerable to anti-tank weapons and mines, their firepower and shock action had a decisive effect on the battlefield.

Hitchcock ordered <b>the</b> <b>clearance</b> of snow from a meadow and ordered the local volunteer fire brigade to blast it away, causing the roof of a nearby building to collapse. The mayor demanded compensation of one shilling, but Hitchcock gave the woman who owned the house two shillings to cover the repair work and the inconvenience. Hitchcock offended the locals by refusing to stay at the village inn, and when he was taken ill with altitude sickness, he blamed the sickness on his reaction to the guttural sound of their accents.|$|E
5|$|The manor of Ruislip {{became part}} of the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District, though it {{remained}} under the ownership of King's College, Cambridge. A town-planning competition led to a design being chosen that envisaged <b>the</b> <b>clearance</b> of much of the woods and historic sites in Ruislip to make way for 7,642 homes, enough for 35,000 residents, across the manor. A planning scheme adapted from the original was presented to the public in February 1913 and was approved by the Local Government Board in September 1914. The outbreak of the First World War halted all construction work, by which time only three new roads had been completed. It did not resume again until 1919.|$|E
5|$|Two prototypes {{were lost}} in accidents, both {{of which had been}} {{primarily}} caused by poor piloting decisions and errors leading to two ground collision incidents; a third Tornado prototype was seriously damaged by an incident involving pilot-induced pitch oscillation. During the type's development, aircraft designers of the era were beginning to incorporate features such as more sophisticated stability augmentation systems and autopilots. Aircraft such as the Tornado and the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon made use of these new technologies. Failure testing of the Tornado's triplex analogue command and stability augmentation system (CSAS) was conducted on a series of realistic flight control rigs; the variable-sweep wings in combination with varying, and frequently very heavy, payloads complicated <b>the</b> <b>clearance</b> process.|$|E

5|$|Worcester was {{an urban}} castle, built within an {{existing}} settlement. Many such castles required <b>the</b> <b>clearance</b> of local properties, but unusually at Worcester Castle the ditch {{of the outer}} bailey cut through part of Worcester Cathedral's cemetery. It is unclear whether the cemetery was still in use at that time, but the desecration resulted in Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, with extensive interests in Worcester, complaining about the seizure {{of the land and}} formally cursing Urse.|$|E
5|$|A {{golf course}} was {{constructed}} alongside the castle in 1900, and the estate was later sold to Sir Arthur Sutherland, a wealthy shipowner, in 1919. Sutherland opened an additional {{course at the}} castle in 1922, designed by the Scottish golfer, James Braid. The costs of maintaining the property became {{too much for him}} and, after undertaking eight years of clearance work in the 1920s, he placed the castle into the guardianship of the state in 1930, with the Commissioners of Works taking control of the property. Archaeological investigations were carried out as part of <b>the</b> <b>clearance</b> work by H. Honeyman in 1929, exposing more of the main gatehouse, and further work was carried out under Robert Bosanquet in the 1930s. Aerial photography was carried out by Walter de Aitchison for the Ordnance Survey.|$|E
5|$|At 19:00 that evening, {{following}} <b>the</b> <b>clearance</b> {{of nearby}} Pakchon by D Company 3 RAR, the Australians sent two companies {{across the river}} to establish a bridgehead and prevent the North Koreans from consolidating their position on the western bank. A and B Companies subsequently established defensive positions {{on either side of}} the road. Shortly afterwards North Korean forces were detected forming up for an assault on the right flank against B Company, and these preparations were broken up with mortars. The North Koreans then engaged the forward Australian companies with mortar fire which was largely ineffective. However, by 22:30 North Korean activity increased significantly, with heavy small arms fire causing a number of casualties among the Australians which perilously had to be evacuated under fire by boat across the fast flowing tidal river. Further artillery support was called-in by the Australians at 23:00 in response to renewed concentrations by the North Koreans in preparation for an assault. Meanwhile, the Australians sent another platoon across the river to reinforce the companies on the western bank.|$|E

40|$|Conventionally {{the size}} of <b>the</b> back <b>clearance</b> played a great {{importance}} on reducing <b>the</b> axial <b>clearance</b> by utilizing <b>the</b> concept that <b>the</b> decreased axial <b>clearance</b> results in lower axial force acting on the impeller.

5|$|But {{transmission}} of Ca2+ is not unidirectional; rather, it is a two-way street. The {{properties of the}} Ca2+ pump SERCA and the channel IP3R present on the ER membrane facilitate feedback regulation coordinated by MAM function. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>clearance</b> of Ca2+ by the MAM allows for spatio-temporal patterning of Ca2+ signaling because Ca2+ alters IP3R activity in a biphasic manner. SERCA is likewise affected by mitochondrial feedback: uptake of Ca2+ by the MAM stimulates ATP production, thus providing energy that enables SERCA to reload the ER with Ca2+ for continued Ca2+ efflux at the MAM. Thus, the MAM is not a passive buffer for Ca2+ puffs; rather it helps modulate further Ca2+ signaling through feedback loops that affect ER dynamics.|$|E
