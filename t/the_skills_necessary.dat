He can also score from corners and crosses. Samaras is also strong which further adds to his physical presence and makes him harder for defenders to play against.|$|E
5|$|Some {{knowledge}} of physiology and {{the physics of}} diving is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans. The physics and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver to understand {{the effects of the}} diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible. The physics mostly relates to gases under pressure, buoyancy, heat loss, and light underwater. The physiology relates the physics to the effects on the human body, to provide a basic understanding of the causes and risks of barotrauma, DCS, gas toxicity, hypothermia, drowning and sensory variations. More advanced training often involves first aid and rescue skills, skills related to specialised diving equipment, and underwater work skills. Further training is required to develop <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>necessary</b> for diving in a wider range of environments, with specialised equipment, and to become competent to perform a variety of underwater tasks.|$|E

5|$|The {{crew of the}} Obsidian have {{temporarily}} {{abandoned the}} vessel {{in order to allow}} it to pass through a black hole. The Obsidian's internal systems are capable of withstanding the black hole, but the station cannot shield its human inhabitants from the gravitational forces. The crew have taken refuge in a smaller craft which has been shielded, intending to return to the Obsidian when both vessels have passed through the black hole. A radiation storm has damaged the Obsidian's engine protection systems and erased its flight path, leaving the station drifting towards the black hole where it will be destroyed. Only one member of the crew has <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>necessary</b> to return to the Obsidian and prepare it to pass through the black hole, this is the game's player character. The astronaut is forced to contend with the Obsidian's re-activated security system which has resulted in security robots being deployed, the space station's internal doors sealing and defensive laser grids becoming active. Once the player has restored power, reactivated the Obsidian's engines and reset the station's flight path, there is a limited time to teleport back to the smaller shielded craft before the Obsidian's engines carry the astronaut through the black hole without being shielded.|$|E

25|$|OBE can be {{compared}} across different institutions. On an individual level, institutions can look at what outcomes a student has achieved to decide what level the student would be at within a new institution. On an institutional level, institutions can compare themselves, by checking to see what outcomes they have in common, and find places where they may need improvement, based on the achievement of outcomes at other institutions. The ability to compare easily across institutions allows students to move between institutions with relative ease. The institutions can compare outcomes to determine what credits to award the student. The clearly articulated outcomes should allow institutions to assess the student’s achievements rapidly, leading to increased movement of students. These outcomes also work for school to work transitions. A potential employer can look at records of the potential employee to determine what outcomes they have achieved. They can then determine if the potential employee has <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>necessary</b> for the job.|$|E

25|$|On 9 November 2006, Carrier Strike Group Seven {{departed}} San Diego {{to sustain}} multi-ship warfare skills through carrying out Joint Task Force Exercise 07-1 (JTFEX 07-1). During the exercise, between 12–16 November 2006, Carrier Strike Group Seven combined with Carrier Strike Group Three, to form Carrier Task Force 150 under the overall command of Rear Admiral Kevin Quinn, Commander, Carrier Strike Group Three. This {{was the first}} time the two groups had operated together. JTFEX 07-1 was not a normal pre-deployment exercise; it aimed to sustain multi-ship warfighting skills in the event either strike group had to make an unexpected deployment. To maintain all <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>necessary</b> to fight the entire two-carrier group together, the exercise tested individual ships (in general quarters and usage of weapons), the two carrier air wings, and the ships and aircraft of the strike group(s) fighting as a team. With the two carrier air wings operating together, the normal 12-hour cycle of flight operations could be doubled to a continuous 24-hour cycle.|$|E
25|$|Ross {{first went}} to Washington, D.C. in 1816 {{as part of a}} Cherokee {{delegation}} to negotiate issues of national boundaries, land ownership and white encroachment. As the only delegate fluent in English, Ross became the principal negotiator, despite his relative youth. When he returned to the Cherokee Nation in 1817, {{he was elected to the}} National Council. He became council president in the following year. The majority of the council were men like Ross, who were wealthy, educated, English-speaking and of mixed blood. Even the traditionalist full-blood Cherokee perceived that he had <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>necessary</b> to contest the whites' demands that the Cherokee cede their land and move beyond the Mississippi River. In this position, Ross's first action was to reject an offer of $200,000 from the US Indian agent made for the Cherokee to voluntarily relocate. Thereafter Ross made more trips to Washington, even as white demands intensified. In 1824, Ross boldly petitioned Congress for redress of Cherokee grievances, the first time a tribe had ever shown the audacity to do such a thing. Along the way, Ross built political support in the capital for the Cherokee cause.|$|E
25|$|Romantic {{relationships}} tend {{to increase}} in prevalence throughout adolescence. By age 15, 53% of adolescents have had a romantic relationship that lasted at least one month {{over the course of}} the previous 18 months. In a 2008 study conducted by YouGov for Channel 4, 20% of 14−17-year-olds surveyed revealed that they had their first sexual experience at 13 or under in the United Kingdom. A 2002 American study found that those aged 15–44 reported that the average age of first sexual intercourse was 17.0 for males and 17.3 for females. The typical duration of relationships increases throughout the teenage years as well. This constant increase in the likelihood of a long-term relationship can be explained by sexual maturation and the development of cognitive skills necessary to maintain a romantic bond (e.g. caregiving, appropriate attachment), although these skills are not strongly developed until late adolescence. Long-term relationships allow adolescents to gain <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>necessary</b> for high-quality relationships later in life and develop feelings of self-worth. Overall, positive romantic relationships among adolescents can result in long-term benefits. High-quality romantic relationships are associated with higher commitment in early adulthood and are positively associated with self-esteem, self-confidence, and social competence. For example, an adolescent with positive self-confidence is likely to consider themselves a more successful partner, whereas negative experiences may lead to low confidence as a romantic partner. Adolescents often date within their demographic in regards to race, ethnicity, popularity, and physical attractiveness. However, there are traits in which certain individuals, particularly adolescent girls, seek diversity. While most adolescents date people approximately their own age, boys typically date partners the same age or younger; girls typically date partners the same age or older.|$|E

500|$|In 1901, {{the course}} of study at Baltimore City College went {{through a series of}} further changes. The most {{significant}} was the reduction of the five-year course of study to four years; though students who entered prior to 1900 were allowed to complete the five-year course. The new course, like the course it replaced, allowed graduates to be admitted to Johns Hopkins University without examination, and provided students with greater flexibility. Instead of requiring students to complete the same set of courses, it allowed students to choose their courses, as long as they completed 150 credits. From 1927 to the early 1990s, the college preparatory curriculum at Baltimore City College was divided into two tracks: the [...] "A" [...] course and the [...] "B" [...] course. Though both tracks were intended to provide students with <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>necessary</b> for college, the [...] "A" [...] course was intended to be more rigorous, enabling students to complete sufficient college-level courses to enter directly into the second year of college. In the early-1990s, then-Principal Joseph Antenson removed the two-tier system because he believed it to be racially discriminatory.|$|E
