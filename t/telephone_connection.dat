At the same time, Lufttransport established itself at Svalbard Airport. During {{the summer of}} 1975, the Norwegian Polar Institute stationed two helicopters at Ny-Ålesund Airport to support their expeditions. During the late 1970s there was little winter activity in Ny-Ålesund, but the air strip was kept operational for the few groups of researchers who did visit. A radio line repeater was installed at Kongsvegpasset in 1980, resulting in Ny-Ålesund receiving a <b>telephone</b> <b>connection.</b> A radio beacon was subsequently installed at the airport.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} the storm's passage, the Government of Thailand began distributing {{relief goods}} to {{residents}} throughout the affected provinces. Despite the effort by the government, 2,500 people from Pa Thiew and Tha Sae demonstrated for additional and more intensive aid on 9 November. These protests were soon dispersed. Following considerable criticism for downplaying {{the impact of the}} typhoon, Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan delayed his visit to the United States to oversee relief efforts. By 15 November the United States pledged to donate US$25,000 for recovery operations. <b>Telephone</b> <b>connection</b> was restored from Bangkok to Prachuap Khiri Khan by this time; however, areas further south remained disconnected. Generators were brought in to keep hospitals and government offices running since much of Chumphon Province remained without electricity for more than two weeks. As the scale of damage became more apparent, a request for international aid was made by 17 November to the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. Upon the announcement of the request, six countries pledged to provide nearly US$510,000 in funds collectively. Agriculture across Surat Thani Province was severely affected by the typhoon in the long-term as well. In the four years following Typhoon Gay, land use for orchards, rubber, and oil palm plantations decreased from 33.32percent to 30.53percent. Additionally, rice paddy coverage decreased from 22.96percent to 13.03percent.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} winter {{there were five}} people who stayed the winter. Research expeditions were {{carried out by the}} Norwegian Polar Institute, {{typically}} with twenty people. Also the University of Cambridge and the University of Trondheim sent annual expeditions of a similar size. An early scientific agent was the Norwegian Institute for Air Research, which has conducted air research in Ny-Ålesund since the mid-1970s. The most prominent project was the Man and the Biosphere Project, which later also saw participation from the University of Tromsø and the University of Bergen and lasted until 1985. Additional international universities started sending expeditions {{in the latter half of}} the 1970s, such as the Max Planck Institute, Louisiana State University and the Danish Space Research Institute.

25|$|Initially all {{meetings}} between the Norwegian and Soviet commissioners and their staff {{was held at}} the Storskog–Boris Gleb crossing. The Soviets quickly bought a small cabin to host meetings. If the meeting was initiated by the Soviets, it was held in the premises, while it was held outdoors if initiated by the Norwegians, unless circumstances dictated {{that it had to be}} held indoors. This caused the Norwegian authorities to build a conference room on their side of the border, which opened in 1956. Initially {{meetings between}} the two commissioners would be called by hoisting a flag or red lamp at the border, and the other country's soldiers would alert the commissioner, who would meet within two hours. Later a <b>telephone</b> <b>connection</b> was installed and the parties agreed on two hours each week day that they were to be available along with an interpreter. Initially the Soviet commissioner was based in Salmijärvi, but later moved to Nikel.|$|E

A false urban myth says that the name was originally meant to be [...] "Monkey Kong", but was misspelled or misinterpreted due to a blurred fax or bad <b>telephone</b> <b>connection.</b> Another, more credible story claims Miyamoto looked in a Japanese-English dictionary for something that would mean [...] "stubborn gorilla", or that [...] "Donkey" [...] was meant to convey [...] "silly" [...] or [...] "stubborn"; [...] "Kong" [...] was common Japanese slang for [...] "gorilla". A rival claim is that he worked with Nintendo's export manager {{to come up with the}} title, and that [...] "Donkey" [...] was meant to represent [...] "stupid and goofy".

2500|$|However, {{while this}} is fine for initialisms such as ktp [...] for etc., it can be {{problematic}} when spelling out names. For example, several consonantal distinctions are difficult for many nationalities, who normally rely {{on the fact that}} Esperanto seldom uses these sounds to distinguish words (that is, they do not form many minimal pairs). Thus the pairs of letter names ĵo–ĝo, ĥo–ho (or ĥo–ko), co–ĉo (or co–so, co–to), lo–ro, and ŭo–vo (or vo–bo) are problematic. In addition, over a noisy <b>telephone</b> <b>connection</b> it quickly becomes apparent that voicing distinctions can be difficult to make out: noise confounds the pairs po–bo, to–do, ĉo–ĝo, ko–go, fo–vo, so–zo, ŝo–ĵo, as well as the nasals mo–no.|$|E

As a result of this shift, there was no real need to limit the user to the speed of the long-distance lines, giving the Bell companies flexibility in terms of what to install at the user's site. Their attention turned to Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), which ran over the existing wiring and did not block a <b>telephone</b> <b>connection</b> in the process.
