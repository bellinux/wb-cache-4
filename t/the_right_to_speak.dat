He secured <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> for the Muslim-led Bengali and Punjabi provincial {{government}}s in the central government in New Delhi ("the centre"). He worked to expand the League, reducing the cost of membership to two annas (⅛ of a rupee), half of what it cost to join the Congress. He restructured the League {{along the lines of}} the Congress, putting most power in a Working Committee, which he appointed. By December 1939, Liaquat estimated that the League had three million two-anna members.|$|E

40|$|The dual {{principles}} of promoting {{the marketplace of}} ideas and protecting individual autonomy lie {{at the core of}} the First Amendment. When the government assumes an affirmative role by opening opportunities for public speech, it places individuals 2 ̆ 7 negative liberties, such as <b>the</b> <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>speak,</b> at risk. This conflict cannot be avoided by analyzing compelled speech outside of the First Amendment; the autonomy promised by <b>the</b> Bill of <b>Rights</b> and repeatedly affirmed by Supreme Court jurisprudence protects <b>the</b> <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> Scholars, jurists, and practitioners therefore should pay close attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> when <b>the</b> government pursues affirmative policies of widening access.

The assembly was apparently given the right to judge cases of high treason and assign punishments for them, such as when Alexander the Great acted as prosecutor in the trial and conviction of three alleged conspirators in his father's assassination plot (while many others were acquitted). However, there is perhaps insufficient evidence to allow a conclusion that councils and assemblies were regularly upheld or constitutionally grounded, or that their decisions were always heeded by the king. At the death of Alexander the Great, the companions immediately formed a council to assume control of his empire, but it was soon destabilized by open rivalry and conflict between its members. The army also used mutiny as a tool to achieve political ends.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the council}} had <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> their minds freely, and {{although}} {{there is no evidence that}} they voted on affairs of state or that the king was even obligated to implement their ideas, it is clear that he was at least occasionally pressured to do so. The assembly was apparently given the right to judge cases of high treason and assign punishments for them, such as when Alexander III acted as prosecutor in the trial and ultimate conviction of three alleged conspirators in the plot to assassinate Philip II (while many others were acquitted). However, there is perhaps insufficient evidence to allow a conclusion that councils and assemblies were regularly upheld, constitutionally grounded, or that their decisions were always heeded by the king. At the death of Alexander the Great, the companions immediately formed a council to assume control of his empire; however, it was soon destabilized by open rivalry and conflict between its members. The army also used mutiny as a tool to achieve political ends. For instance, when Perdiccas had Philip II's daughter Cynane murdered to prevent her own daughter Eurydice II of Macedon from marrying Philip III of Macedon, the army revolted and ensured that the marriage took place.|$|E

25|$|On the {{initiative}} of the municipality of Linkebeek, the Constitutional Court of Belgium was asked for an opinion on the constitutionality of article 23 {{of the law of}} 18 July 1966 that stipulates that the internal language of administration in the rim municipalities has to be Dutch. In its ruling 98/26 of 10 March 1998, the Court ruled this was not in violation with articles 10 and 11 of the Constitution of Belgium and that the mayor and aldermen do indeed not have <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> in another language than Dutch during council meetings. The Court further specified that the language facilities do not alter the principle of Dutch unilingualism of the concerned municipalities and that the Constitution guarantees the primacy of Dutch.|$|E
25|$|The Ainu have {{historically}} suffered from {{economic and social}} discrimination throughout Japan that continues to this day. The Japanese Government {{as well as people}} since contact with the Ainu, have in large part regarded them as a dirty, backwards and a primitive people. The majority of Ainu were forced to be petty laborers during the Meiji Restoration, which saw the introduction of Hokkaido into the Japanese Empire and the privatization of traditional Ainu lands. The Japanese government during the 19th and 20th centuries denied the rights of the Ainu to their traditional cultural practices, most notably <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> their language, as well as their right to hunt and gather. These policies were designed to fully integrate the Ainu into Japanese society with the cost of erasing Ainu culture and identity. The Ainu's position as manual laborers and their forced integration into larger Japanese society have led to discriminatory practices by the Japanese government that can still be felt today. This discrimination and negative stereotypes assigned to the Ainu have manifested in the Ainu's lower levels of education, income levels and participation in the economy as compared to their ethnically Japanese counterparts. The Ainu community in Hokkaido in 1993 received welfare payments at a 2.3 times higher rate, had a 8.9% lower enrollment rate from junior high school to high school and a 15.7% lower enrollment into college from high school than that of Hokkaido as a whole. The Japanese government has been lobbied by activists to research the Ainu's standard of living nationwide due to this noticeable and growing gap. The Japanese government will provide ¥7 million beginning in 2015, to conduct surveys nationwide on this matter.|$|E

5000|$|O Wheel is a millennial {{collection}} of poems - {{some of them}} masquerading as diary notes - celebrating {{the beauty of the}} American West and the poet's love of his African home. The work also looks back at a century of unprecedented violence and the wrenching death of his father. In [...] "Two Mountains," [...] the poet, recognising himself as Isaac at the place of sacrifice, becomes the invoked Muse. Powell's Books described O Wheel as [...] "a book of amazing delicacy, intricacy, and formal beauty that reveals terrifying truths. Its backdrop is an edgy mix of the intense violence of South Africa's recent history, the personal struggles of the human soul for <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> freely and <b>to</b> experience justice, and the expanse of the American literary landscape. Peter Sacks employs a variety of poetic styles and approaches that break new ground formally as well as thematically. With a vision that is at once personal and public, he contends with nihilism and extracts hope from even the most barbaric aspects of human nature. O Wheel offers sensitive and striking poems that menace, overwhelm, entice, provoke, and deeply move the reader." ...|$|R

His work continued to be socially and politically aware with paintings like Festival #1 (1978) showing brilliant Senufo figures, a work supporting South Africans at war.
