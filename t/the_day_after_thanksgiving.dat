25|$|The move by {{retailers}} to begin holiday sales during Thanksgiving Day (as {{opposed to the}} traditional day after) has been criticized as forcing (under threat of being fired) low-end retail workers, who compose an increasing share of the nation's workforce, to work odd hours and to handle atypical, unruly crowds on a day reserved for rest. In response to this controversy, Macy's and Best Buy (both of which planned to open on Thanksgiving, even earlier than they had the year before) stated in 2014 that most of their Thanksgiving Day shifts were filled voluntarily by employees who would rather have <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> off instead of Thanksgiving itself. Blue laws in several Northeastern states prevent retailers in those states from opening on Thanksgiving.

After surging past Texas A linebacker Warrick Holdman, Williams took advantage of a lead block by fullback Ricky Brown and then streaked down the left sideline. Williams then powered through a tackle attempt by Texas A safety Rich Coady at the A 12. He then took advantage of a block by wide receiver Wane McGarrity, barging past cornerback Jason Webster's tackle at the goal line.|$|E

25|$|In ice hockey, the National Hockey League announced, {{as part of}} its decade-long {{extension}} with NBC, {{that they}} would begin airing a game on the Friday afternoon following Thanksgiving beginning the 2011–12 NHL season; the game has since been branded as the Thanksgiving Showdown. (The Boston Bruins have played matinees on Black Friday since at least 1990, but 2011 is the first time the game has been nationally televised.) The NHL has played games on Thanksgiving, usually scheduling games involving Canadian teams (but not always, {{as was the case in}} 2016, when the league scheduled a nationally televised game Thanksgiving night between two American teams on the West Coast). In Canada, Thanksgiving is in October, although no games were scheduled in 2011 and only one was scheduled in 2012 (both the Thanksgiving Showdown and the lone Canadian game on U.S. Thanksgiving were canceled as a result of a labor dispute in 2012); as a result of the effective day off, almost all of the league's teams play <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>Thanksgiving.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 1976 {{season began}} with the Panthers ranked ninth in the AP preseason poll. The first game was at Notre Dame, where the Irish grew the grass long {{on the playing field}} in a failed attempt to slow down Dorsett, who had burned them for 303 rushing yards the year before. Their efforts were in vain as Dorsett ran for a 61-yard {{touchdown}} on Pitt's first play from scrimmage {{on the way to a}} 31–10 win. The season continued with a 42–14 win at Georgia Tech and a 36–19 win over Miami. On October 23, the Panthers travelled to Annapolis to face Navy during which Dorsett broke the NCAA career rushing record on a 32-yard touchdown run in Pitt's 45–0 victory. Dorsett's achievement prompted a mid-game celebration in which even Navy saluted the feat with a cannon blast. Pitt next defeated eastern rival Syracuse 23–13, and on November 6, number two ranked Pitt easily handled Army while number one ranked Michigan lost to Purdue. For the first time since 1939, the Pitt Panthers were the number one ranked team in the country. The following week, they successfully defended their top rating in a close Backyard Brawl against rival West Virginia. With a record of 10–0, the Panthers headed into their regular season finale with only heated instate rival Penn State standing in the way of Pitt's national title aspirations. At a packed Three Rivers Stadium on <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>Thanksgiving,</b> the Nittany Lions held Dorsett to 51 yards in the first half and had the game tied 7–7. Majors adjusted for the second half by shifting Dorsett from tailback to fullback, enabling him to explode for an additional 173 yards as Pitt rolled to a 24–7 victory that capped an undefeated regular season. In December, Dorsett became the first Pitt Panther to win the Heisman Trophy as the nation's best college football player. Dorsett also won the Maxwell Award, the Walter Camp Player of the Year Award, and was named UPI Player of the Year. The 11–0 Panthers accepted an invitation to the 1977 Sugar Bowl to face second ranked Georgia. Pitt defeated the Bulldogs 27–3 and was voted number one in both the final Associated Press and Coaches polls, claiming their ninth national championship. This was Pitt's first undefeated national championship since 1937. The American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) named Majors the 1976 Coach of the Year. Following this historic season, Majors returned to his alma mater, the University of Tennessee, to take the head coaching job.|$|E

500|$|The Longhorns were {{in control}} of the Iowa State game almost from the very {{beginning}} and they routed the Cyclones 56–3, the worst loss for the Cyclones since 1997. Lined up in the spread offense on the first play from scrimmage, Colt McCoy scrambled away from a blitz and threw a pass to Jordan Shipley for a 58-yard touchdown. The offensive line provided great protection for Colt McCoy, who called most of the plays without huddling and directed the Longhorns to touchdowns on his first five series. He completed 23 of 30 passes for 298 yards, 4 touchdowns, and no interceptions. His most athletic play came early in the third quarter when he evaded three defenders on a play from the Cyclones' 20-yardline. He twisted around and managed to stay upright long enough to throw a pass to Nate Jones in the end zone. He capped off his performance by making his first rushing touchdown of the season, a career-long, 44-yard run in the third quarter. The play was designed to be a screen pass to the fullback. Mack Brown said, [...] "Colt was as good today as I've ever seen him." [...] Brown also praised McCoy for taking on more of a leadership role with the team. The Austin American-Statesman said, [...] "Colt McCoy is shedding his sophomore slump. In the past two games, he is 42 of 56 passing for 622 yards with six passing touchdowns, one rushing touchdown and just one interception. That translates to a quarterback rating of 200.1." [...] However, against Baylor on October 20, Colt would go on to throw 2 interceptions and 1 touchdown, and against Nebraska the following week, McCoy completed less than 50% of his passes and threw another interception. On <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>Thanksgiving,</b> McCoy was 17 of 32 with 1 interception, while be sacked 4 times in the 38-30 loss to Texas A At the conclusion of the 2007 regular season, Mccoy had thrown for 21 touchdowns and 18 interceptions.|$|E
