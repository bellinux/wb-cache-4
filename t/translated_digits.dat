50|$|Each local {{exchange}} incorporated {{up to eight}} groups of directors which translated the first three digits (ABC digits) comprising the exchange name into a pulse train of one to six digits, as required for each exchange and unique to that exchange. The <b>translated</b> <b>digits</b> {{were sent to the}} code selectors, and then the four numeric digits were sent to three switching stages in the terminating exchange (two group selectors and a final selector). Hence local calls within the exchange and busy direct junction routes to exchanges with high traffic from that exchange could be trunked via one code selection stage, which reduced both the setting-up time and the total numbers of selectors required in the network. Distant exchanges which did not justify direct junction routes could be called via one or more tandem exchanges; being routed via one, two or three local code selectors in the originating exchange, one or more selectors in the tandem exchange(s), and finally the numeric selection stages in the terminating exchange for the last four digits, which were stored and forwarded without translation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{handling}} of the digit 0. The straightforward translation from punched form would place the blank before digits 1 - 9, and encode 0 somewhere else entirely. All codes have some special-case handling which either <b>translates</b> the <b>digit</b> 0 to the all-zero binary code (and moves the blank elsewhere), or gives it binary code 001010 (decimal 10) and uses the 8+2 punch elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|Some {{communication}} systems omit {{one or more}} of these steps,or use techniques that combine several of these steps together.For example, a Morse code transmitter combines source coding, channel coding, and line coding into one step, typically followed by an amplitude modulation step.Barcodes, on the other hand, add a checksum digit during channel coding, then <b>translate</b> each <b>digit</b> into a barcode symbol during line coding, omitting modulation.|$|R
50|$|Until the 1950s, {{a typical}} {{telephone}} {{number in the}} United States and many other countries consisted of a telephone exchange name and a 4 or 5-digit subscriber number. The first two or three letters of the exchange name <b>translated</b> into <b>digits</b> given by a mapping typically displayed on the telephone's rotary dial by grouping the letters around the assigned digit. The table (right) shows the typical assignment in the Bell System in use until the late 1950s. The letter Q was not used, and Z was translated to 0 (zero) on some dials, albeit never used in the name system. For example, a New Yorker's phone number might have been CHelsea 4-5034, which another telephone subscriber would dial as the <b>digit</b> sequence 2445034, <b>translating</b> C to 2, and H to 4.|$|R
50|$|The dialing codes used by trunk {{operators}} to connect calls were originally assigned and established to ensure speed with pulse dialing equipment. With {{the advent of}} subscriber dialed calls, numbering patterns were reassigned to provide for mnemonic methods of improving customer performance. Subscriber trunk dialling (STD) codes all began with 0. The largest cities, which had seven digit local numbers, were allocated special codes - London, 01; Birmingham, 021; etc. Smaller towns were typically allocated a code based on the first letters of their name, <b>translated</b> into <b>digits</b> on the telephone dial. For example, OXford translated into 09 on the British phone dial, so the original STD code for Oxford was 0096. However, because of subscriber dialing errors, there was an early decision to eliminate codes that began with 00 and Oxford soon became 0865, the sequence 86 designating the first two letter of university.|$|R
2500|$|While the Strowger (step-by-step or SxS) switch moves {{synchronously}} {{with the}} dial pulses {{that come from}} the telephone dial, the more sophisticated Panel switch had senders, similar to {{the directors of the}} later Director system Strowger exchanges used in London and other large British cities. The sender first registered and stored the digits that the customer dialed, and then, with the help of other frames, <b>translated</b> the received <b>digits</b> into numbers appropriate for the selectors: District Brush, District Group, Office Brush, Office Group, Incoming Brush, Incoming Group, Final Brush, Final Tens, Final Units.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) methods {{has become an}} integral component of aggregating, analyzing, and evaluating health data. The current practical applications of GIS in epidemiologic studies range from descriptive statistics (i. e., plotting data on a map) to evaluation of spatial relations between environmental exposures and health outcomes. Several definitions exist for geographic information systems. One of the most recent, as found in Healthy People 2010, defines GIS as “powerful tools combining geography, data and computer mapping ” (U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2000). Software packages available today, such as ArcMap and MapInfo, integrate many GIS functions. These include (1) database management, (2) data manipulation and analysis, and (3) data presentation (i. e., displaying data on a map). To be included in GIS, the data should {{have some kind of}} geographical or spatial component that can be <b>translated</b> into <b>digit</b> maps. Digital Map Formats GIS applications use either a vector or a raster map format, or a combination of the two. In vector maps (Figure A 11. 2 - 1) geographic features are represented by points (e. g., location of infants with birth defects), lines (e. g., streets), and polygons (e. g., census tracts) (Rogers, 1999). These features are base...|$|R
25|$|In {{the most}} areas of North America, {{telephone}} numbers in metropolitan communities {{consisted of a}} combination of digits and letters, starting in the 1920s until the 1960s. Letters were <b>translated</b> to dialed <b>digits,</b> a mapping that was displayed directly on the telephone dial. Each of the digits 2 to 9, and sometimes 0, corresponded to a group of typically three letters. The leading two or three letters of a telephone number indicated the exchange name, for example, EDgewood and IVanhoe, and were followed by 5 or 4 digits. The limitations that these system presented in terms of usable names that were easy to distinguish and spell, and the need for a comprehensive numbering plan that enabled direct-distance dialing, led to the introduction of all-number dialing in the 1960s.|$|R
40|$|A {{gradient}} of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) plays a {{major role}} in specifying the antero-posterior pattern of structures that develop in the distal part of the vertebrate limb, in particular, the antero-posterior pattern of the digits. Classical embryological experiments identified the polarizing region (or zone of polarizing activity, ZPA), a signaling region at the posterior margin of the early chick wing bud and, consistent with a model in which production of a diffusible morphogen specifies antero-posterior positional information, polarizing region signaling was shown to be dose dependent and long range. It is now well established that the vertebrate hedgehog gene, Sonic hedgehog (Shh), which encodes a secreted proteis expressed in the polarizing region of the chick wing and that Shh signaling has the same characteristics as polarizing region signaling. Shh expression at the posterior of the early limb bud and the mechanism of Shh signal transduction are conserved among vertebrates including mammals. However, it is unlikely that a simple Shh gradient is responsible for digit pattern formation in mammalian limbs and there is still little understanding of how positional information specified by Shh signaling is encoded and <b>translated</b> into <b>digit</b> anatomy. Alterations in Shh signaling underlie some congenital limb abnormalities and also changes in timing and extent of Shh signaling appear to be related to the evolution of morphological diversity of vertebrate limbs...|$|R
40|$|Subjects {{trained in}} a {{standard}} data entry task, which involved typing numbers (e. g., 5421) using their right hands. At test (6 months post-training), subjects completed the standard task, followed by a left-hand variant (typing with their left hands) that involved the same perceptual, but different motoric, processes as the standard task. At a second test (8 months post-training), subjects completed the standard task, followed by a code variant (<b>translating</b> letters into <b>digits,</b> then typing the digits with their right hands) that involved different perceptual, but the same motoric, processes as the standard task. For {{each of the three}} tasks, half the trials were trained numbers (old) and half were new. Repetition priming (faster response times to old than new numbers) was found for each task. Repetition priming for the standard task reflects retention of trained numbers; for the left-hand variant reflects transfer of perceptual processes; and for the code variant reflects transfer of motoric processes. There was thus evidence for both specificity and generalizability of training data entry perceptual and motoric processes over very long retention intervals...|$|R
5000|$|When STD codes were {{initially}} assigned, Romford {{was given the}} mnemonic code RO8 (corresponding to 708 on the rotary dial), with Hornchurch {{and the rest of}} the area using the HX2 (402) code. With the transition to all-figure dialling which ended the practice of representing STD codes with letters in 1966, and including the trunk prefix, these became 0708 and 0402. The 0402 code covered seven exchanges in a linked numbering scheme, with an additional digit for each exchange, as below. Internally, the 0402 code was <b>translated</b> to routing <b>digits</b> by registers to the same string of digits as 0708 plus an additional 8, which corresponded to the 8 in the local code from Romford Group Switching Centre to the local exchange. This technique was used to keep the dialled string down to the 10 digit limit that was imposed (though Stapleford only had 3 digit local numbers and South Ockendon 4 digits and so these could be dialled as 0708 8x xxx as well as the official 0402x xxx / xxxx.) ...|$|R
