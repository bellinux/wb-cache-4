50|$|YellOwStaR and Fnatic {{started off}} their {{season at the}} IEM Season VIII - World Championship. The team {{finished}} 2nd, losing to KT Rolster Bullets in the Grand Final.The Spring Split went relatively well for YellOwStaR and the team. A <b>tight</b> <b>split</b> saw YellOwStaR perform {{on a range of}} champions including Morgana, Annie, and Karma in particular. Fnatic ended the split in 2nd place behind SK Gaming, securing themselves a place in the Spring Playoffs. The whole team raised their game for the playoffs, and they emerged victorious after a win against Alliance in their semifinal matchup, and another against SK Gaming in the Grand Final.Due to Fnatic's performance in the Spring Playoffs, they had qualified to compete at All-Star Paris 2014, along with other regional winners from around the world. The team made it to the semifinals of the tournament, losing only to the world champions at the time, SK Telecom T1 K.The start of the Summer Split was shaky for YellOwStaR and the team. Fnatic could not break into the top 2 until Week 7 of the split, at which point their main rivals Alliance were already a considerable distance ahead of them in the race for 1st place. YellOwStaR managed to impress with his Thresh and Morgana throughout, picking up the Weekly MVP Award for Week 7, but Fnatic could only manage a 2nd-place finish. His performances on these champions also contributed to YellOwStaR picking up the MVP Award for the entire split.The team aimed to put the split behind them and focus on the Summer Playoffs. A close fought win over ROCCAT in the semifinal meant that YellOwStaR and the team would face Alliance in the final. The match ended in defeat for Fnatic, but the playoffs saw the team seal their qualification for the 2014 Season World Championship.The World Championship saw Fnatic placed in Group C with Samsung Blue, OMG, and LMQ. The team were only able to win 2 matches out of 6 in their group, meaning that they would go no further in the tournament.|$|E

We show that if L is a <b>tight</b> <b>split</b> Lie-Rinehart algebra over an associative and commutative algebra A, then L and A decompose as the orthogonal direct sums L = ⊕_i ∈ IL_i, A = ⊕_j ∈ JA_j, where any L_i is a nonzero ideal of L, any A_j is a nonzero ideal of A, and both decompositions satisfy that for any i ∈ I there exists a unique ĩ∈ J such that A_ĩL_i ≠ 0. Furthermore any L_i is a split Lie-Rinehart algebra over A_ĩ.

40|$|Rapid {{mobile data}} traffic growth is {{becoming}} in a reality and several forecasts expect {{that it will}} be continued in upcoming years. It is expected that significant indoor investment will be made not only by traditional operators but also by facility owners for their own purposes. A key challenge to such local network providers is provisioning ever-increasing mobile traffic demand at the current level of production cost per bit. A popular deployment strategy so far is deploying WLAN networks. While denser indoor deployment is foreseen, the interference from inside of a network as well as other neighboring operators can be a limiting factor for higher capacity. Tighter interference management will certainly provide higher efficiency in network and spectrum usage. Nevertheless, costs to allow fast information sharing among access points are necessary for advanced interference coordination. Moreover, managing interference across networks owned by different operators raises not only infrastructure cost but also the network interrelatedness which operators are typically reluctant for business independency. When taking into account the cost and barriers for interference coordination, it is still not so obvious that coordination in wireless broadband systems will be advantageous to operators. In this thesis, we address the operator benefit of downlink interference coordination in two aspects: 1) multi-cell coordination with no interference from neighboring operators, and 2) inter-operator coordination in shared spectrum. In order to deal with interference and cost tradeoff analysis, we explicitly develop a techno-economic analysis framework and reform a traditional cost model. Numerical results indicate that the economic benefit of the multi-cell coordination significantly depends on propagation conditions and average user demand level. A self-deployed WLAN network can be the cheapest deployment option in closed areas up to certain average demand level. Over the demand level or in open areas, advanced joint processing schemes in a cellular domain may be a viable solution. The drawback is that it requires extremely accurate channel state information at transmitters for practical usage. When inter-operator interferences is present, asymmetric cellular networks will be likely to appear due to business independency and selfishly compete to access spectrum with no or little network-level coordination. A network designed for more fairness with higher transmission power will have more benefit against the other counterpart. Although asymmetric competition lets operators unfairly utilize spectrum, sharing spectrum with reasonable geographical separation can outperform over static coordination, i. e., traditional spectrum <b>split.</b> <b>Tight</b> cooperation to maximize a common objective can further offer the performance benefit to both involved partners. However, the cooperation gain quickly diminishes as network separation and size increases because self-interference becomes more dominant.

40|$|Ochratoxin A (OA), a {{nephrotoxin}} {{and potential}} carcinogen, {{has been found}} in many foods, including grapes and grape products. Limits of 2 μg/kg in wine and 10 μg/kg in dried vine fruit have been introduced by the European Union. This study presents information on the ecology of ochratoxin A production by black Aspergillus spp. in Australian vineyards, and the passage of the toxin throughout winemaking. Aspergillus niger and A. carbonarius were isolated from vineyard soils in 17 of 17, and four of 17 Australian viticultural regions, respectively. A. aculeatus was isolated infrequently. All thirty-two isolates of A. carbonarius and three of 100 isolates of A. niger produced OA. Of Australian A. niger isolates analysed for restriction fragment length polymorphisms within the internal transcribed spacer region of 5. 8 S ribosomal DNA, 61 of 113 isolates, including the three toxigenic isolates, were of type N pattern, and 52 were type T. A selection of these A. carbonarius and A. niger aggregate isolates, as well as imported isolates, were compared using enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) -PCR, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and microsatellite markers. ERIC and AFLP clearly differentiated A. niger from A. carbonarius. AFLP further divided A. niger into types N and T. Six polymorphic microsatellite markers, developed specifically for A. niger, also differentiated strains into N and T types. There was no clear relationship between genotypic distribution and ochratoxigenicity, substrate or geographic origin. The survival of A. carbonarius spores on filter membranes was examined at water activities (aw) 0. 4 - 1. 0, and at 1 °C, 15 °C, 25 °C and 37 °C. Survival generally increased at lower temperatures. The lowest water activity, 0. 4, best supported the survival of spores, but 0. 6 - 0. 9 aw was often deleterious. Complex interactions between temperature and water activity were observed. Viability of A. carbonarius spores on filter membranes decreased ca 10 [superscript 5] fold upon exposure to sunlight, equivalent to 10 mWh of cumulative ultraviolet irradiation at 290 - 400 nm. Growth and toxin production were examined for five isolates of A. carbonarius and two of A. niger on solid medium simulating juice at early veraison, within the range 0. 98 - 0. 92 aw, and at 15 °C, 25 °C, 30 °C and 35 °C. Maximum growth for A. carbonarius and A. niger occurred at ca 0. 965 aw / 30 °C and ca 0. 98 aw / 35 °C, respectively. The optimum temperature for OA production was 15 °C and little was produced above 25 °C. The optimum aw for toxin production was 0. 95 for A. niger and 0. 95 - 0. 98 for A. carbonarius. Toxin was produced in young colonies, however, levels were reduced as colonies aged. Black Aspergillus spp. were more commonly isolated from the surface than from the pulp of berries, and increased with berry maturity, or damage. A. niger was isolated more frequently than A. carbonarius and A. aculeatus. Populations of A. carbonarius inoculated onto bunches of Chardonnay and Shiraz decreased from pre-bunch closure to early veraison. Populations from veraison to harvest were variable, and ncreased in bunches with <b>tight</b> clustering and <b>splitting.</b> In a trial with Semillon bunches, omitting fungicide sprays after flowering did not increase the development of Aspergillus rot. Inoculation of bunches with A. carbonarius spore suspension did not necessarily result in Aspergillus bunch rot. In vitro trials suggested that the severity of rot was mediated primarily by the degree of berry damage, followed by the extent of spore coverage. No clear trends regarding cultivar susceptibility were observed. For Semillon bunches inoculated with A. carbonarius spores with and without berry puncture, increased susceptibility to rot and OA formation was associated with berry damage, in particular at greater than 12. 3 °Brix (20 d before harvest). OA contamination of bunches was related to the number of mouldy berries per bunch, with shrivelled, severely mouldy berries the primary source of OA. Puncture-inoculation of white grapes (Chardonnay and Semillon) and red grapes (Shiraz) on the vine with A. carbonarius resulted in berries containing OA. Inoculated grapes displayed greater total soluble solids due to berry shrivelling, and greater titratable acidity due to production of citric acid by the fungus. Samples taken throughout vinification of these grapes were analysed for OA. Pressing resulted in the greatest reduction in OA (68 - 85 % decrease in concentration, compared with that of crushed grapes). Additional reductions occurred at racking from grape and gross lees, and after storage. OA was removed by binding to marc, grape and gross lees. Pectolytic enzyme treatment of white must, bentonite juice fining, recovery of juice or wine from lees, and static or rotary style fermentation of red must, had no effect on OA contamination. Bentonite in white wine (containing 56 mg/L grape-derived proteins) and yeast hulls in red wine were effective fining agents for removing OA. Findings from these studies may contribute to the improvement of strategies to minimise OA in Australian wine and dried vine fruit. Thesis (Ph. D.)
