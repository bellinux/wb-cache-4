It was only {{towards the end of the}} medieval period, when means of communication improved, that households, both noble and royal, became more permanently attached to one residence.|$|E
5|$|The large {{surface area}} and vascularization of the crest also {{suggests}} a thermoregulatory function. The first to propose the cranial crests of lambeosaurines related to temperature regulation was Wheeler (1978). He proposed {{that there was a}} nerve connection between the crest and the brain, so that the latter could be cooled by the former. The next people to publish a related idea were Maryanska and Osmólska, who realized that like modern lizards, dinosaurs could have possessed salt glands, and cooled off by osmo-regulation. In 2006 Evans published an argument about the functions of lambeosaurine crests, and supported why <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> causing factor for the evolution of the crest.|$|E

25|$|A {{functional}} modeling perspective concentrates on describing the dynamic process. The main concept in this modeling perspective is the process, <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> function, transformation, activity, action, task etc. A well-known {{example of a}} modeling language employing this perspective is data flow diagrams.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} {{interpolation method}} is to locate the nearest data value, and assign the same value. In simple problems, this method {{is unlikely to be}} used, as linear interpolation (see below) is almost as easy, but in higher-dimensional multivariate interpolation, <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> favourable choice for its speed and simplicity.|$|E

25|$|Modern mayfly nymphs do not acquire gills {{until after}} their first moult. Before this stage they are so small that they need no gills to extract oxygen from the water. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> trait from the common {{ancestor}} of all flyers. An early terrestrial insect would have no need for paired outgrowths from the body before it started {{to live in the}} trees (or in the water, for that matter), so it would not have any.|$|E

The solution is an oxidizing agent that picks up the electrons at the cathode. As with the electron chain in the yeast cell, <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> variety of molecules such as oxygen, although a more convenient option is a solid oxidizing agent, which requires less volume.|$|E

He explained <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> solution because blank votes currently make up a majority of the votes in elections, which means that election results are inaccurate.|$|E
25|$|A Moot Hill of Chapelton is {{recorded}} in the Register of the Great Seal of Scotland as being specifically excluded by King James from a grant of lands including Lainshaw, Robertland and Gallowberry to Alexander Hume in the 15th century. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> secondary use of a burial mound, although {{a number of the}} 'Moot' or 'Justice' Hills seem to have been constructed for the purpose. It may imply that the chapel itself was not on the hill, given that the 15th-century date is pre-reformation and the chapel would therefore be still in use.|$|E
25|$|A bhoot or bhut is {{a supernatural}} creature, usually {{the ghost of}} a {{deceased}} person, in the popular culture, literature and some ancient texts of the Indian subcontinent. Interpretations of how bhoots come into existence vary by region and community, but they are usually considered to be perturbed and restless due to some factor that prevents them from moving on (to transmigration, non-being, nirvana, or heaven or hell, depending on tradition). <b>This</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> violent death, unsettled matters in their lives, or simply the failure of their survivors to perform proper funerals.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{emotional}} approach coping may {{signal to the}} social environment that an individual {{is in need of}} support. The responsiveness of the social environment will determine the adaptiveness {{of emotional}} approach coping. Emotional expression that is met with empathetic concern may lead to better adjustment than emotional expression met by rejection. Some evidence from the research suggests <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> potential mechanism. For women with breast cancer who perceive their social environment to be highly receptive, coping through emotional expression predicts improved quality of life.|$|E
25|$|Observations of the Australian {{painted lady}} {{migration}} {{date back to}} the 1960s. In 1963, a large migration took place in a south-easterly direction from late August to late September. It was characterized by the species becoming suddenly common in certain areas where the it had previously been sparse. That year was noted to have been unusually wet in Australia. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> trait shared with V. cardui, which migrates in Europe during the wet season. The Australian painted lady migrates south in the spring and summer, and north in the autumn and winter.|$|E
25|$|Mate {{guarding}} tactics {{employed by}} males {{tend to be}} hiding the female from intrasexual threats; this could be not bringing the mate to social events in which other competing males may be present. Another is to request that the female wear items that indicate possession, <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> wedding ring or the male's jacket for example. Males may also demonstrate the quality of resources they have to offer (e.g. buying the mate gifts, or paying for a meal). Men {{are also more likely}} to employ threatening and violent behaviour towards intrasexual rivals.|$|E

Earlier studies note that smoking acts have progressively declined, suggesting smoking is no longer as frequent on prime time television. The current study notes higher levels of smoking. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> indication that smoking is returning, and/or related to recent programming changes featuring more dramas on prime time television...|$|R
25|$|For {{decades the}} {{international}} diplomatic community has requested that Syria and Lebanon {{take steps to}} determine the exact boundary and officially register the demarcated border with the United Nations. However, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria has refused to do so. On 31 October 2007, {{the definition of the}} physical extent of the Shebaa Farms area by former UN cartographer Miklos Pinther was released by the UN. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> prelude to an eventual negotiated demarcation of the territory.

25|$|Russell {{trusted the}} IPMs {{to give a}} true picture of the {{national}} average, because he assumed death rates to be relatively equal across the social spectrum. This assumption has later been proven wrong, and studies of peasant plague mortality from manor rolls have returned much higher rates. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> consequence of the elite's ability to avoid infection by escaping plague-infected areas. It could also result from lower post-infection mortality among those more affluent, due to better access to care and nursing. If so, this would also mean that the mortality rates for the clergy who were normally better off {{than the general population}} were no higher than the average.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} of Gullknapp attracted criticism from some sources. This was mostly {{concerned with the}} services at Kjevik. Professor Frode Steen stated that Kjevik {{has a hard time}} attracting international routes and retaining competition on the route to Oslo. If a significant amount of patronage is redirect to Gullknapp, <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> pivoting cause of insufficient volume on certain routes and could see airlines pull out of Kjevik or hinder the establishment of new routes. Also the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise in Agder stated that they were opposed to an expansion, stating that Agder was best served with one primary airport. Similarly, the Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries opposed the expansion, stating that it would weaken Kjevik and Torp.|$|E
