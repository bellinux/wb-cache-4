General forms of these are similar to stub low-pass filters except that the main line {{is no longer a}} narrow high impedance line. Designers have many different topologies of stub filters to choose from, some of which produce identical responses. An example stub filter is shown in figure 12; it consists of a row of Î»/4 short-circuit stubs coupled together by Î»/4 impedance <b>transformers.</b> The stubs {{in the body of the}} filter are double paralleled stubs while the stubs on the end sections are only singles, an arrangement that has impedance matching advantages. The impedance <b>transformers</b> have the effect of transforming the row of shunt anti-resonators into a ladder of series resonators and shunt anti-resonators. A filter with similar properties can be constructed with Î»/4 open-circuit stubs placed in series with the line and coupled together with Î»/4 impedance <b>transformers,</b> although this structure is not possible in planar technologies.|$|E
