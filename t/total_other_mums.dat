It was winding me up and going on in my head.' King later remarked that The Apprentice includes a [...] "blame culture" [...] and the atmosphere [...] "wasn't necessarily great for business".|$|R

The levels of FIS fees are also positively related to firm value after controlling for <b>total</b> <b>other</b> fees, or <b>total</b> <b>other</b> non-audit fees.
