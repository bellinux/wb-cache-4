50|$|At {{its peak}} in the 1930s the {{generating}} equipment comprised: one 5 MW, five 10 MW, two 15 MW Oerlikon and British Thomson-Houston <b>turbo-alternators,</b> and one Parsons 4 MW house service set (450-500 V), total capacity 89 MW. Some of the older plant was decommissioned. By 1952 the plant comprised one 5 MW and two 10 MW Oerlikon <b>turbo-alternators,</b> two 10 MW and two 15 MW B.T.H. <b>turbo-alternators</b> and one Parsons 4 MW set.|$|R
50|$|Vertical engine nos 5, 7 and 9 {{were removed}} between 1912 and 1914 {{to allow the}} {{addition}} of <b>turbo-alternators.</b>|$|R
50|$|Provision (foundations) {{was made}} for the {{addition}} of three more reciprocating steam engine-alternator sets, but this was abandoned in favour of <b>turbo-alternators.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... one 1,500 kW Brush-Ljungstrom <b>turbo-alternator,</b> {{and three}} further sets of Metropolitan-Vickers 3000 kW alternators.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>turbo-alternator</b> set was {{commissioned}} {{in the summer}} of 1951, subsequent sets coming into use by the spring of 1952.|$|E
50|$|The Wolf Creek and Callaway plants {{each have}} single half speed, 1,800 RPM (60 Hz), steam {{turbine-alternator}} sets which use the steam produced {{from the heat}} generated in the reactor to produce about 1,200 MW of electricity at the US grid frequency of 60 Hz. Such large <b>turbo-alternator</b> sets were not available in the UK at the time Sizewell B was designed. So that orders could be given to UK manufacturers, and to avoid project risk in dealing with what were at the time newly designed very large <b>turbo-alternator</b> sets, Sizewell B uses two full-speed, 3,000 RPM (50 Hz), nominal 660 MW <b>turbo-alternator</b> sets {{similar to those used}} at Drax coal-fired power station, and at the last of the AGRs Heysham 2, but adapted to cope with the wetter steam conditions produced by the PWR steam supply system. PWR steam supply systems produce saturated steam at lower temperature and pressure than the dry superheated steam produced by AGR reactors or coal-fired power stations, and the high- and intermediate-pressure stages of the steam turbines have to be designed cope with this Sizewell B can run at half power using one <b>turbo-alternator.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{identical}} units 1 and 2 have {{a design}} output of 120 MW each. They both have <b>turbo-alternators</b> manufactured by Brown Boveri and 'drum type' boilers by Fives Penhoet, France.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} {{extended}} in 1907. An identical boiler {{house to the}} first was built and three 5,000 kW <b>turbo-alternators</b> were installed. This expansion brough the stations total generating capacity to 25,000 kW.|$|R
50|$|Kearsley Power Station was a {{coal-fired}} power station in Stoneclough, near Kearsley, Bolton, England. It was designed in 1927 by Dr H.F. Parshall for the Lancashire Electric Power Company. The original installation was known as Kearsley 'A', comprising two British Thomson-Houston (B.T.H.) <b>turbo-alternators</b> rated at 32.25 megawatts each. Further extensions became Kearsley 'B' (1936/38), with two more B.T.H. <b>turbo-alternators</b> each capable of producing 51.6 megawatts. Finally Kearsley 'C' (1949) was completed with two more B.T.H. machines rated at 52 megawatts each. The station closed in 1980 when only 'B' station remained operational. The 5 cooling towers were demolished {{during the week of}} 14 May 1985.|$|R
50|$|Unit 3 has {{a design}} output of 271 MW. It uses a <b>turbo-alternator</b> {{manufactured}} by Alstom, France and a 'once through' type Boiler by M.A.N Germany.|$|E
50|$|The {{specification}} of generating equipment at Bankside B was as follows.The 120 MW <b>turbo-alternator</b> {{was in the}} top 20 of the most efficient of UK electricity generators between 1963-73.|$|E
50|$|Wangi Power Station was {{decommissioned}} in 1986, approximately {{thirty years}} after the first <b>turbo-alternator</b> commenced operation. The greater part of the generating equipment was removed by the early 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|F1 with an ABB Atom BWR 69 at 2928 MW thermal and 1010 MWe net {{was first}} {{connected}} to the grid on 5 June 1980, and commenced commercial operation on 10 December 1980. It has two <b>turbo-alternators.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{power station}} was officially opened on 7 November 1958 {{after ten years}} of {{construction}} and two years of progressive commissioning of the six <b>turbo-alternators</b> from C. A. Parsons and Company, which gave it a capacity of 330 MW.|$|R
50|$|Ultimo Power Station boasted {{a mixture}} of equipment, {{initially}} consisting of American-made steam engines coupled to dynamoelectric machines (direct current generators). Later generating units were British-made <b>turbo-alternators.</b> Most of the alternating current (AC) equipment operated at 6,600 volts, 25 cycles per second.|$|R
50|$|During the {{two years}} that followed, two new boilers were {{installed}} (numbers 3 and 4) which, along with 5 and 6, exceeded the output that the old generators from the original Tejo Power Station could withstand. The CRGE concluded {{that it was necessary}} that another <b>turbo-alternator</b> be purchased to add to the two generators ordered years before from the German supplier and which were still held up, thus moving forward with the construction of one part of the machinery room to accommodate this new generator. In 1919, the new Swiss Escher Wyss & Cie 7500 kW <b>turbo-alternator</b> began operating.|$|E
50|$|In 1911 a 5 MW 25 Hz Willans Dick-Kerr <b>turbo-alternator</b> was {{installed}} {{with a similar}} 5 MW machine added in 1913. These machines replaced the vertical generators and were numbered 5 and 8.|$|E
50|$|The {{power station}} was officially opened by the Prince of Wales on 28 May 1923, {{when he started}} the station's BTH 30 MW <b>turbo-alternator.</b> The station {{remained}} operational until 30 October 1978. It had a generating capacity of 56 MW.|$|E
50|$|As demand {{increased}} the plant {{went through a}} series of upgrades, the first being an expansion to the engine house. The first of 2 Parsons-Brush 1MW single phase <b>turbo-alternators</b> with a terminal voltage of 4.2kv were added in 1905. A Curtis-Thompson 1.5MW turbo alternator was bought in 1907.|$|R
50|$|The <b>turbo-alternators</b> for ship-service power {{exhausted}} at 20 psi {{gauge pressure}} instead of into a condenser. This steam was used {{all over the}} ship before finally going to a condenser. Space heating, galley, cooking, laundry, freshwater evaporation, fuel, and feed-water heating were all taken from the 20 psi back-pressure line.|$|R
50|$|The station {{generated}} electricity using four <b>turbo-alternators,</b> {{each with}} a capacity of 60 megawatts (MW), giving the station a total generating capacity of 240 MW. The station was planned to use eight boilers, but only seven were ever installed. The railway sidings that serviced the previous station were extended. Four locomotives worked the coal yard.|$|R
5000|$|F3 with an ABB Atom BWR 75 at 3300 MW thermal and 1190 MWe net and {{was first}} grid {{connected}} on 3 March 1985 and commenced commercial operation on 21 August 1985. It is a later design with one <b>turbo-alternator.</b>|$|E
50|$|On 30 March 1994, an {{accidental}} explosion {{occurred in the}} engine compartment while the boat was engaged in a naval exercise off Toulon. The explosion killed ten men, including the commander, who were examining the <b>turbo-alternator</b> room. The boat returned to base under diesel and battery power.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} {{equipped}} with two British Thomson-Houston 25 MW turbo-alternators. An additional 30 MW <b>turbo-alternator</b> was ordered from BTH in 1935. By 1948, further extensions to the site had increased its combined generating capacity to around 200 MW. The station was later converted to oil firing.|$|E
50|$|Eraring Power Station is a {{coal fired}} {{electricity}} power station with four 720 MW Toshiba steam driven <b>turbo-alternators</b> for a combined capacity of 2,880 MW. The station is {{located near the}} township of Dora Creek, on the western shore of Lake Macquarie, New South Wales, Australia and is {{owned and operated by}} Origin Energy. It is Australia's largest power station.|$|R
50|$|Meaford B {{power station}} was located {{to the south}} of A station. The station was built using {{numerous}} main and sub-contractors to include G. Percy Trentham Ltd. (excavations, roads, railway sidings, superstructure etc.), Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Co. Ltd. (station steel frame), P.C. Richardson & Co. (chimney), Babcock & Wilcox Ltd. (boiler plant), British Thomson-Houston Co. Ltd. (<b>turbo-alternators)</b> and many contractors.|$|R
50|$|Munmorah Power Station is a {{demolished}} {{coal fired}} electricity power station with four 350 MW English Electric steam driven <b>turbo-alternators</b> for a combined capacity of 1,400 MW. The station was located near Doyalson, {{on the shores}} of Lake Munmorah, New South Wales, Australia and was owned and operated by Delta Electricity, a company owned by the New South Wales Government.|$|R
50|$|However, the boilers couldnâ€™t reach a {{high output}} {{because they were}} {{operating}} under low pressure; the High Pressure auxiliary equipment had to be built and the turbines adapted. The auxiliary building grew within the low pressure boiler room, making it necessary to dismantle boilers 1 and 2 in 1943. On the other hand, making the turbines in sets 2 and 3 compatible with a high pressure process was complicated, since the order placed with the German manufacturer encountered the commercial blockade that spread all over the European continent {{as a consequence of}} World War II.The equipment finally arrived in 1942, allowing High Pressure electric power production to begin the following year. In 1943, boilers 12 and 13 began to supply <b>turbo-alternator</b> number 2, and in 1944, boiler 14 began supplying <b>turbo-alternator</b> 3.|$|E
5000|$|Like the [...] "A" [...] station, its {{turbines}} {{were built}} by C.A. Parsons & Company {{and it has}} two 600 MWe <b>turbo-alternator</b> sets, producing a maximum output of 1200 MWe, though net output is 1090 MWe after the effects of house load, and downrating the reactor output due to corrosion and vibration concerns.|$|E
50|$|In 1928 a 7,500 kW British Thomson-Houston (BTH) <b>turbo-alternator</b> was added, {{supplied}} with steam from the Babcock & Wilcox boilers. In 1929, a 500 kW Parsons turbo alternator {{was moved to}} the station from Carn Brea Power Station, along with a Babcock & Wilcox boiler, but they were never satisfactory and were removed by 1935.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after {{beginning}} the construction work, World War I broke out, causing delays in established deadlines and problems receiving the two <b>turbo-alternators</b> ordered from Germany, which remained detained {{until the end}} of the conflict. Nonetheless, in 1916 the first two low pressure boilers were installed (which in the project were assigned numbers 5 and 6) in order to supply the generators from the original power station.|$|R
50|$|The second {{station on}} the site, Hams Hall B Power Station, was planned in 1937. It began {{generating}} electricity in 1942. The station was expanded between 1946 and 1949. The station had a generating capacity of 160,500 kW. With it's completion the two stations formed the greatest concentration of generating plant in Europe. Its water was cooled by four cooling towers. The station used Parsons <b>turbo-alternators.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Wallerawang Power Station is {{a thermal}} coal power station, located near Wallerawang, in the Central Tablelands region of New South Wales, Australia. The power station is {{equipped}} with two <b>turbo-alternators</b> of [...] each, supplied by C. A. Parsons and Company of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England. Due to dwindling demand, {{the first of the}} two generating units was mothballed in January 2013, and the second in April 2014.|$|R
