He's always making the right pass, always making the big shots, always making the big plays, always making his free throws.... The kid is a winner. He's always been a winner.|$|E
500|$|Ullman filed {{a lawsuit}} in 1992, {{claiming}} that her show {{was the source of}} The Simpsons success and therefore should receive a share of the show's profit. [...] "I breast-fed <b>those</b> <b>little</b> devils," [...] Ullman once said of The Simpsons. She wanted a share of The Simpsons merchandising and gross profits and believed she was entitled to $2.5 million of Fox's estimated $50 million in 1992. The Fox network had paid her $58,000 in royalties for The Simpsons as well as $3 million for the 3½ seasons her show was on the air. Eventually the courts ruled in favor of the network.|$|E

500|$|The various scandals {{involving}} Constantin Al. Ionescu-Caion {{have left}} distinct marks on Romania's cultural life. Boia writes: [...] "Caion [...] secured himself an unwanted fame {{in the history}} of Romanian literature". In early 20th-century Transylvania, [...] "Caion" [...] was adapted into a common noun and a term of contempt. Listing its [...] "Transylvanophobe" [...] enemies, Luceafărul noted the existence of [...] "all sorts of Caions, <b>those</b> <b>little</b> puppies raised by the obscure magazines." [...] Also in Luceafărul, priest-publicist Alexandru Ciura stated: [...] "We live in the epoch of the Caions, for whom all things are permitted". Caion's poor reputation also rubbed off on Macedonski: Caragiale's disciple Alexandru Cazaban coined the word Macaionski, as a hybrid of both writers.|$|E

[...] The songs on the album are all written about persons who Paul considers to be American heroes including Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Edison, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Rosa Parks. The album is Paul's attempt to teach children about some of America's most famous heroes. [...] "I was {{a big fan of}} Schoolhouse Rock in the 70s. [...] There was always a really great charm about the music. [...] The main reason I can still remember the Preamble of the Constitution is because of <b>those</b> <b>little</b> songs", Paul said.

"Roland" [...] {{contains}} the series' first mention of Fox Mulder's father Bill, although the character would not actually {{make an appearance}} until the second season episode [...] "Colony". In the original draft of the script for [...] "Roland", however, Mulder's mention of his father was instead meant to be his sister, Samantha. The scene depicting {{the aftermath of the}} Dr. Keats' murder—with the scattered pieces of his shattered frozen body marked off with multiple chalk outlines—has been described as [...] "truly inspired". Chris Carter noted that [...] "any shock and horror was eliminated by the laugh you got when you saw <b>those</b> <b>little</b> pieces on the floor", also commenting that the actual murder takes place off-screen, and is only heard.|$|E

500|$|The {{landscape}} in Eragon {{is based on}} the [...] "wild territory" [...] of Paolini's home state, Montana. He said in an interview: [...] "I go hiking a lot, and oftentimes when I'm in the forest or in the mountains, sitting down and seeing some of <b>those</b> <b>little</b> details makes the difference between having an okay description and having a unique description." [...] Paolini also said that Paradise Valley, Montana is [...] "one of the main sources" [...] of his inspiration for the {{landscape in}} the book (Eragon takes place in the fictional continent Alagaësia). Paolini [...] "roughed out" [...] the main history of the land before he wrote the book, but he did not draw a map of it until it became important to see where Eragon was traveling. He then started to get history and plot ideas from seeing the landscape depicted.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for MTV News at Dylan's Candy Bar, Minaj revealed that she had kept the collaboration a secret from everyone she knew because she was [...] "so surprised" [...] at being asked to work with Carey and {{did not believe that}} the collaboration would actually come to fruition. [...] "That one, I didn’t believe until I was physically in the studio that I was doing with something with Mariah," [...] Minaj said. [...] "She’s an icon, I’ve loved her since I was little, like ’Vision of Love,’ ’Someday.’ I was one of <b>those</b> <b>little</b> girls in the mirror singing her songs with my mother.” A release date of February 23, 2010, for the album was slated, and then pushed back to March 9. It was then further pushed back to March 30. However, it was confirmed in March 2010 that production of Angels Advocate had halted and the project was shelved indefinitely. Island Def Jam stated that the singer was instead working on a new project and [...] "new surprises". Metro revealed that Carey was possibly recording a Christmas album.|$|E
500|$|The abuse {{he faced}} {{at the hands}} of opponents early in his NHL career {{prompted}} Iginla's coaches to work at developing his physical play. While he was not enthusiastic about fighting, Iginla accepted then head coach Brian Sutter's arguments that he needed to adopt a more aggressive style to improve as a player. Iginla is most effective when he has room to manoeuvre, and to create that space, he had to intimidate his opponents. The lessons Iginla learned have carried throughout his career. [...] "You've got a power forward who does it all," [...] said Craig Conroy. [...] "I mean, he'll fight, and hit, and score goals. Maybe it's not the end-to-end rushes, but he does all <b>those</b> <b>little</b> things that win games and get things done." [...] His opponents also respect his play. Rob Blake said that while Iginla is not known for fancy play, [...] "he'll run you over. Or he'll fight somebody. And then he'll score a goal. He does pretty much everything you'd want a guy to do." ...|$|E

500|$|Sevigny {{has long}} been {{considered}} a fashion icon and regularly appears on best dressed lists. Throughout her career, she has modelled for several high-profile designers, including Miu Miu, H, Louis Vuitton and Chloé. Prior to her career as an actress, she had achieved fame for her unique style. While her sense of style in the early 1990s only reflected small downtown scenes and trends, it still made a significant impression on high class fashion chains which began to emulate Sevigny's look. Her interest in fashion and clothing, {{as well as her}} career as a fashion model in her late teenage years and early twenties, have led to a career as a prominent and well-respected fashion designer. She has expressed interest in fashion design throughout the entirety of her career, even dating back to her childhood: [...] "Little House on the Prairie was my favorite show. I would only wear calico print dresses, and I actually slept in one of <b>those</b> <b>little</b> nightcaps!", she told People in 2007. Her unorthodox style (which garnered her initial notoriety in the early '90s) has often been referred to as very eclectic. Sevigny has since released several clothing lines designed by herself, both solo and in collaboration, and has earned a title as a modern fashion icon.|$|E
500|$|Corey Taylor {{explained}} that the phrase [...] "All Hope Is Gone" [...] is aimed at the fans' expectations of the band, further elaborating, [...] "Just when you thought you had us figured out, give up all hope because you're never, ever going to." [...] Throughout the album, Taylor incorporates a focus on politics in his lyrics, compared to Slipknot's previous albums. The opening track, [...] ".execute.", features Taylor's response to former United States Vice President Spiro Agnew's speech targeted at Vietnam War protesters. and the second track [...] "Gematria (The Killing Name)" [...] follows in the same vein. During an interview with Kerrang!, Taylor discussed the song's lyrical content, explaining, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} people who are disguising politics as religion and dictating taste and turning it into policy. And that hurts me." [...] Reviewing for IGN, Jim Kaz said that lyrically, [...] "Gematria (The Killing Name)" [...] gives the listener a [...] "heaping dose of Corey Taylor's caustic bravado". On the track [...] "Wherein Lies Continue", Taylor offers a [...] "dressing down of the world as we know it", explaining, [...] "It kinda goes up against any civilization that takes themselves way too seriously and where the 'leaders' are so pretentious that they think they are deemed to speak for the people." [...] He also proclaimed, [...] "It wouldn't be a Slipknot album if I didn't rag on the recording industry." [...] On [...] "Butcher's Hook", Taylor specifically targets [...] "all <b>those</b> <b>little</b> emo boys", commenting, [...] "People give us shit for wearing outfits, but all of those guys look exactly the same." ...|$|E
500|$|USA Today Robert Bianco {{acknowledged}} that the episode managed to avoid repeating many of the second season's mistakes noting that the four main characters spend more time together and the annual mystery [...] "is hot-wired into the housewives themselves." [...] Bianco remarked that Cross successfully maintained her position as the series' most prominent lead and was pleased with Susan's storyline, calling it [...] "a conflict that gives Teri Hatcher a genuinely funny, rather than forced, sight gag." [...] He approved of the writers' decision to distance the characters from their second season storylines, but opined: [...] "The harder mistake to overcome is the damage the show did to its main characters — allowing them to behave in ways that made them seem weak, selfish, stupid and, at times, despicable." [...] Bianco concluded: [...] "It {{will take more than}} one good episode to win us back after all that. But it's certainly a good place to start." [...] Jen Creer of TV Squad was mixed in her review. She criticized the lack of originality in the storylines, writing that the episode was similar to Sex and the City. Nevertheless, Creer complimented the main actresses, concluding, [...] "I'll be tuning in next week [...] for all of its camp and unoriginality, the show does continue to have that certain something, <b>those</b> <b>little</b> twists of genius that make it worth watching." [...] Andy Dehnart of MSNBC was slightly more positive in his review, acknowledging that while [...] "most of the housewives are stuck in their second-season ruts," [...] the show's overall quality has improved, citing the Orson storyline as a welcomed change from the slow-moving Applewhite mystery arc. Overall, Dehnart approved of the episode and felt that the show [...] "may be on track to finally pleasuring its audience in new, albeit familiar ways." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Man from Jupiter" [...] {{was widely}} lauded by {{television}} commentators. In his A- review, Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{felt that the}} episode contained many great moments and {{felt that it was}} a strong opening for the season. VanDerWerff wrote: [...] "Archer has always been a show I enjoyed more for the fast-paced dialogue and weird office plots, but every so often, the show does something pretty awesome, even on what's probably a fairly limited budget, and it turns out an action sequence that you just won't see on most other animated shows. FX has usually chosen to open seasons with these big action episodes, for fairly obvious reasons, and this one has the added benefit of Burt Reynolds hanging out as another potential ratings bump." [...] VanDerWerff noted that the storyline between Sterling Archer and his mother Malory Archer was the highlight of [...] "The Man from Jupiter"; [...] "Archer's so often at odds with her because he's unable to see her as a person and not just his mother, as Reynolds expresses while roaring down the highway at dangerously high speeds. Until Archer accepts that Malory has needs—some of them sexual—he’s always going to be trapped in a weird, co-dependent relationship with her. Archer isn't a show that tries to shove tons and tons of deep character moments into its episodes, which makes it all the better when it does do so. The show usually nails <b>those</b> <b>little</b> moments, and this was no exception." [...] Creative Loafing journalist Scott Harrel asserted, [...] "If the debut episode is any indication, you can expect another satisfying season from this intelligent, imaginative and button-pushing mix of high and low humor." [...] Ross Bonaime of Paste issued the installment an 8.8 out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "commendable" [...] rating. Bonaime affirmed that Reed adequately developed the characters, citing that [...] "The Man from Jupiter" [...] further established greater expectations for the series.|$|E
