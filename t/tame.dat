5|$|The humorous 2007 {{animated}} film Bee Movie used Jerry Seinfeld's first script and {{was his first}} work for children; he starred as a bee named Barry B. Benson, alongside Renée Zellweger. Critics found its premise awkward and its delivery <b>tame.</b>|$|E
5|$|The red-capped robin {{typically}} perches in {{a prominent}} location {{low to the}} ground, often flicking its wings and tail. It is very active and does not stay still for long. The female has been reported as being fairly <b>tame,</b> while the male is more wary of human contact.|$|E
5|$|At Chayalkudi, {{a village}} near Panchalankurichi, lives Vellaiyammal, who vows {{to marry the}} man who tames her pet bull. She takes her bull to {{participate}} in a Jallikattu game held at Panchalankurichi under Kattabomman's patronage. All those who attempt to <b>tame</b> the bull fail. At Kattabomman's call, his commander-in-chief, Vellaiyathevan, subdues the bull and wins Vellaiyammal's love. Later, Kattabomman learns of their love and has them marry.|$|E
5000|$|In other languages, such as Spanish, {{the word}} for <b>taming</b> {{is the same as}} {{the word for}} domestication. However, in the English language, the two words refer to two {{partially}} overlapping but distinct concepts. For example feral animals are domesticated, but not <b>tamed.</b> Similarly, <b>taming</b> is not the same as animal training, although in some contexts these terms may be used interchangeably.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we analyze a <b>tamed</b> 3 D Navier-Stokes {{equation}} {{in uniform}} $C^ 2 $-domains (not necessarily bounded), which obeys the scaling invariance principle, and prove {{the existence and}} uniqueness of strong solutions to this <b>tamed</b> equation. In particular, if there exists a bounded solution to the classical 3 D Navier-Stokes equation, then this solution satisfies our <b>tamed</b> equation. Moreover, {{the existence of a}} global attractor for the <b>tamed</b> equation in bounded domains is also proved. As simple applications, some well known results for the classical Navier-Stokes equations in unbounded domains are covered. Comment: 23 Page...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the convergence of}} the <b>tamed</b> Euler-Maruyama (EM) scheme for a class of neutral stochastic differential delay equations. The strong convergence results of the <b>tamed</b> EM scheme are presented under global and local non-Lipschitz conditions, respectively. Moreover, under a global Lipschitz condition, we provide {{the rate of the}} convergence of <b>tamed</b> EM, which is smaller than the rate convergence of classical EM scheme one half...|$|R
5|$|Generally {{the bedrock}} of {{the west of the}} town {{consists}} of coal measures, which were exploited by the coal mining industry, while the east is mainly millstone grit. Overlying the bedrock are deposits of glacial sand and gravel, clay, and some alluvial deposits. Ashton Moss, a peat bog, lies {{to the west of the}} town and was originally much larger. The River <b>Tame</b> forms part of the southern boundary, dividing the town from Stalybridge and Dukinfield, and the River Medlock runs to the west.|$|E
5|$|In their unmodified wild state, red foxes are {{generally}} unsuitable as pets. Many supposedly abandoned kits are adopted by well-meaning {{people during the}} spring period, though {{it is unlikely that}} vixens would abandon their young. Actual orphans are rare, and the ones that are adopted are likely kits that simply strayed from their den site. Kits require almost constant supervision; when still suckling, they require milk at four-hour intervals day and night. Once weaned, they may become destructive to leather objects, furniture and electric cables. Though generally friendly toward people when young, captive red foxes become fearful of humans, save for their handlers, once they reach 10 weeks of age. They maintain their wild counterpart's strong instinct of concealment, and may pose a threat to domestic birds, even when well fed. Although suspicious of strangers, they can form bonds with cats and dogs, even ones bred for fox hunting. Practical uses for <b>tame</b> foxes are few, though they can be encouraged to kill rats and mice in granaries. <b>Tame</b> foxes were once used to draw ducks close to hunting blinds.|$|E
5|$|It {{can become}} quite bold and <b>tame,</b> much like its close relative, the pied currawong on the Australian mainland, {{especially}} in public parks and gardens where people make {{a habit of}} feeding it. Black currawongs have been recorded taking young peas from pods, raiding orchards, seizing chickens from poultry yards, and entering barns in search of mice.|$|E

40|$|For {{stochastic}} {{differential equations}} (SDEs) with a superlinearly growing and globally one-sided Lipschitz continuous drift coefficient, the classical explicit Euler scheme fails to converge strongly {{to the exact}} solution. Recently, an explicit strongly convergent numerical scheme, called the <b>tamed</b> Euler method, is proposed in [Hutzenthaler, Jentzen & Kloeden, Ann. Appl. Probab., 22 (2012), pp. 1611 - 1641. ] for such SDEs. Motivated by their work, we here introduce a <b>tamed</b> version of the Milstein scheme for SDEs with commutative noise. The proposed method is also explicit and easily implementable, but achieves higher strong convergence order than the <b>tamed</b> Euler method does. In recovering the strong convergence order {{one of the new}} method, new difficulties arise and kind of a bootstrap argument is developed to overcome them. Finally, an illustrative example confirms the computational efficiency of the <b>tamed</b> Milstein method compared to the <b>tamed</b> Euler method. Comment: 23 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

Although Gobrecht's model is not known with certainty, some sources state that the bird in flight was based on Peter the eagle, a <b>tame</b> bird fed by Mint workers in the early 1830s until it {{was caught up in}} machinery and killed. The bird was stuffed, and is still displayed at the Philadelphia Mint.|$|E
5|$|McCormick {{increasingly}} {{resented the}} favours FitzRoy gave to assist Darwin with collecting. On 16 February, FitzRoy landed a small party including himself and Darwin on St. Paul's rocks, finding the seabirds so <b>tame</b> {{that they could}} be killed easily, while an exasperated McCormick was left circling the islets in a second small boat. That evening novices were greeted by a pseudo-Neptune, and in the morning they crossed the equator with the traditional line-crossing ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The castle's {{positioning}} {{may have}} been to allow its garrison to guard the <b>Tame</b> Valley; both castle and valley were in the medieval manor of Tintwistle.

5|$|The {{script was}} written {{specifically}} for Hepburn, and was tailored to her personality. Filming began in September 1937 and wrapped in January 1938; {{it was over}} schedule and over budget. Production was frequently delayed due to uncontrollable laughing fits between Hepburn and Grant. Hepburn struggled with her comedic performance and was coached by her co-star, vaudeville veteran Walter Catlett. A <b>tame</b> leopard was used during the shooting; its trainer was off-screen with a whip for all its scenes.|$|E
5|$|The term hybrid {{is derived}} from Latin hybrida, used for crosses such as of a <b>tame</b> sow and a wild boar. The term came into popular use in English in the 19th century, though {{examples}} of its use have been found from the early 17th century. Conspicuous hybrids are popularly named with portmanteau words, starting in the 1920s with the breeding of tiger-lion hybrids (liger and tigon).|$|E
5|$|There are anecdotal {{reports of}} <b>tame</b> {{frigatebirds}} being kept across Polynesia and Micronesia in the Pacific. A bird {{that had come}} from one island and had been taken elsewhere could be reliably trusted to return to its original home, hence would {{be used as a}} speedy way to relay a message there. There is firmer evidence of this practice taking place in the Gilbert Islands and Tuvalu.|$|E
50|$|The term often {{applies to}} the <b>taming</b> and display of other big cats such as tigers, leopards, jaguars, cheetahs, and cougars.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{an explicit}} <b>tamed</b> Euler scheme of stochastic differential equation with random coefficients driven by Lévy noise, which has super-linear drift coefficient. The strong convergence {{property of the}} <b>tamed</b> Euler scheme is proved when drift coefficient satisfies one-sided local Lipschitz condition whereas diffusion and jump coefficients satisfy local Lipschitz conditions. A rate of convergence for the <b>tamed</b> Euler scheme is recovered when local Lipschitz conditions are replaced by global Lipschitz conditions and drift satisfies polynomial Lipschitz condition. These {{findings are consistent with}} those of the classical Euler scheme. New methodologies are developed to overcome challenges arising due to the jumps and the randomness of the coefficients. Moreover, as an application of these findings, a <b>tamed</b> Euler scheme is proposed for the stochastic delay differential equation driven by Lévy noise with drift coefficient that grows super-linearly in both delay and non-delay variables. The strong convergence property of the <b>tamed</b> Euler scheme for such SDDE driven by Lévy noise is studied and rate of convergence is shown to be consistent with that of the classical Euler scheme. Finally, an explicit <b>tamed</b> Milstein scheme with rate of convergence arbitrarily close to one is developed to approximate the stochastic differential equation driven by Lévy noise (without random coefficients) that has super-linearly growing drift coefficient...|$|R
5|$|Waxwings {{can be very}} <b>tame</b> in winter, {{entering}} {{towns and}} gardens in search of food, rowan berries being a particular favourite. They can metabolise alcohol produced in fermenting fruit, but can still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Other hazards include predation by birds of prey, infestation by parasites and collisions with cars or windows. The Bohemian waxwing's high numbers and very large breeding area mean that it is classified as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 202 {{different}} birds {{have been recorded}} on the island. Eighteen species of land birds breed {{on the island and}} there are many more migratory species that occur on the island and its adjacent islets, many <b>tame</b> enough that it is possible for humans to get quite close. The island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Endemic Bird Area, and the Permanent Park Preserve as an Important Bird Area, because it supports the entire population of Lord Howe woodhens, most of the breeding population of providence petrels, over 1% of the world population of another five seabird species, and the whole populations of three endemic subspecies.|$|E
5|$|According to the Domesday Survey of 1086, Tameside {{was divided}} into four manors, those of Tintwistle, Hollingworth, Werneth, and Mottram. The land east of the River <b>Tame</b> was in the Hundred of Hamestan in Cheshire and held by the Earl of Chester while {{to the west of}} the river was in the Hundred of Salford under Roger de Poitevin. These manors were divided to create further manors, so that by the 13th century most of them were owned by local {{families}} and remained in the hands of the same families until the 16th century. Manorialism continued as the main for of administration and governance until the mid-19th century.|$|E
