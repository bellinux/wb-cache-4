40|$|Abstract:The paper {{introduces}} {{the application of}} prestressed anchors and soil nails support system in complex soil layer deep foundation pit engineering at Lanzhou region based on the deep foundation pit engineering in Gansu Provincial Hospital of TCM as the background and discusses its key technology. The effect shows that scheme of the design of foundation pit support engineering is reasonable and effective. The engineering meets requirements of design and environment. The monitoring results show that prestressed anchors can control the horizontal displacement and the change rate of slope′s vertical settlement effectively. The experience of engineering is significance for similar engineerings at Lanzhou region. 1. Project profile The building project of rehabilitation and health care is located in north of Gansu Provincial Hospital of TCM, in district of qilihe of lanzhou. Building storys are 18 to 21 layers, including the 2 storeys basement. The depth of proposed site foundation pit is about 12. 45 m. Surrounding environment of Ground pit is complex. The shortest distance between brick-concrete structure building (5 floors) which {{is located on the}} west of ground and the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>foundation</b> pit excavation line is about 4. 4 m. The shortest distance between Boiler Room(1 ~ 3 floors) which is located on the southwest of ground and the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>foundation</b> pit excavation line is about 0. 9 m. The shortest distance between dormitory (2 floors) which is located on the south of ground and the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>foundation</b> pit excavation line is about 6. 2 m. On the eastern of ground that is spacious can be used as piling up and processing materials. On the north of ground is civil bungalow that outside the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>foundation</b> pit excavation line is about 2. 5 m~ 5 m. According to the "construction of supporting technical specification " (JGJ 120 - 2012), the safety grade of foundation pit is class A. Figure 1 shows foundation pit support.

40|$|Most {{of actual}} {{abutments}} in rivers {{are built on}} foundation, while there is limited number of study available {{on the effects of}} the foundation on the local scour. In this study, temporal variation of local scour around compound abutment was investigated experimentally under clear-water conditions. The results showed that a suitable level of foundation is able to decrease the scour depth and increase scour time during the flood events. The trend of temporal scour depth at compound pier and abutment is similar. The scour depth develops to <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>foundation</b> quickly, and then the foundation postpones the scour development (lag–time). Duration of lag–time depends on the foundation level, velocity ratio (U/Uc) and foundation dimension. This study highlights that proper design of foundation level increases duration of scouring and provides enough time to treat bridge foundation after the flood events...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the effective seismic strengthening methods for masonry walls in developing countries, {{a total of}} twenty eight unreinforced masonry (URM) and confined masonry (CM) walls were constructed and tested. The specimens include two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) masonry walls with and without wall reinforcing bars or U-shaped connecting bars, which were tested under constant gravity load and repeated lateral forces. The heights of inflection point considered were 0. 67 and 1. 1 times {{the height of the}} wall measured from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>foundation</b> beam. The constant vertical axial stresses applied were 0. 48 and 0. 84 MPa. Test results obtained for each specimen include cracking patterns, load-deflection data, and strains in reinforcement and walls in critical locations. As observed from the obtained test results, it may be concluded that the CM walls with connecting bars at the vertical wall-to-column connections and the horizontal wall reinforcement are quite effective to develop the higher seismic performance than the ordinary URM walls. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE In the event of strong motion earthquakes, a large number of severe structural damage has bee...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. With {{the scale}} {{development}} of our high-rise buildings, {{together with the}} development and enhancing of monitoring technology of deep foundation pit supporting construction. Control accuracy is the main part for monitoring technical process in deep foundation pit supporting construction, the requirement of monitoring is higher and higher than before, relevant monitoring method, frock and tools, earthwork type of shipping and downriver way in engineering construction will develop in revolutionary way. In view of above mentioned, this paper try to do researching on monitoring technical process in deep foundation pit supporting construction in our country, hope to supply reference for counterparts. The Monitoring Purpose in Deep Foundation Pit Supporting Construction In supporting construction, due {{to the complexity of}} the geological condition, loading condition, material property, strained condition and mechanical mechanism of underground structure, working conditions and other factors from outside, so far, supporting construction is still a incomplete scientific technology, it is hard to predict problems happening in the engineering from aspect of theory, furthermore, theory prediction value can not reflect all kinds of changes in engineering completely and correctly. So, it is necessary to do field monitoring under guidance of theoretical analysis. Horizontal displacement on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>foundation</b> pit, settlement monitoring in foundation pit Point of subside in ground displacement is inbuilt on the top range of foundation pit, after manual hole digging, reinforcement is inserted, then fixing with concrete. The diameter of the hole is 300 mm, the depth is 0. 5 m, rimming of it is built with brick, setting 10 fixed points on the edge of foundation pit...|$|E
