500|$|George {{is excited}} {{when he finds}} that he and Jerry are having dates on the same night. Both of their dates go well {{up to the point}} that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodnight. George's date Carol (Tory Polone) asks George to come up to her place for some coffee, but George tells her that he can't drink coffee at night because it [...] "keeps [...] up". Once she leaves his car he realizes he made a mistake, as [...] "coffee" [...] is a {{euphemism}} for sex. Jerry's date Donna (Gretchen German) remarks that she likes a cotton Dockers commercial that Jerry absolutely hates, and with that ends his interest in her.|$|E
500|$|As {{the season}} progressed, the ratings declined, greatly hurting the show's {{chances of being}} renewed. Writer John McNamara {{partially}} blamed Briscos low ratings on its [...] He said not many people watch television at that time, so [...] "fighting for numbers" [...] then was [...] "like being stuck on Normandy beach". Grushaw acknowledged the high quality of the show and the vocal support from its small fan base. [...] "Obviously the viewers are very passionate about the show... and when you {{read some of the}} things <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> it gives you real pause", Grushaw told USA Today in 1994. By May of that year, Grushaw said renewing Brisco was a 50–50 call. At the end of its season, Brisco was one of the lowest rated shows of the year, and Fox confirmed its cancellation in June.|$|E
500|$|The BBC Deputy Director General, Mark Byford, also {{defended the}} {{decision}} {{on the day of}} the programme, saying: [...] " [...] should have the right to be heard, be challenged, and for the public who take part in Question Time and the viewers to make up their own minds about the views of the BNP. It's not for the BBC to censor and say they can't be on". The BBC's chief political adviser, Ric Bailey, stated after the failed appeal that the BBC [...] "would have been breaking its charter if it had not treated the BNP with impartiality ... We absolutely stand by that judgement, even though there's obviously been a lot of controversy about it". A senior BBC presenter, John Humphrys, said the decision was [...] "absolutely right". He said: [...] "Why should we be afraid of what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say?</b> Free speech is the issue here, and the BBC's obligations." [...] However, broadcasting unions said some of its members would protest at the invitation.|$|E
60|$|Neither of the pair, however, {{appeared}} cheerful, and Weston's {{face grew}} hard {{when he heard}} what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the mine.|$|R
60|$|For {{some moments}} neither father nor son said {{anything}} more. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> a queer sense of insurmountable insufficiency. Neither was saying what he <b>had</b> wanted <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> the other, {{but it was}} not clear to them now what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> one another....|$|R
60|$|When {{the boys}} {{got back to}} the hotel they found Dick Rover looking for them. He listened in {{surprise}} <b>to</b> what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
500|$|Section 5 {{is based}} on Article 9 of the United Kingdom's Bill of Rights 1689: [...] "he [...] of Speech and Debates or Proceedings in [...] {{ought not to be}} impeached or {{questioned}} in any Court or Place out of [...]" [...] On the basis of this provision, and for other reasons, a long line of authorities in the Commonwealth have held that courts are precluded from impeaching or questioning the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament. This is so even if the legal action is brought by, and not against, a member of the legislature. Immunity also extends to independent persons appointed by Parliament exercising their duties in relation to Parliament's activities. In Prebble v. Television New Zealand Ltd. (1994), the Privy Council held that if any exceptions were made unless in the most extreme circumstances, members of the legislature would not know if there would subsequently be challenges to what they are saying in Parliament. Therefore, members would not have the confidence to state fully and freely what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Cocker {{credits his}} upbringing, almost {{exclusively}} in female company, for his interest in how women think and what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> He wrote a song ("A Little Soul" [...] on This Is Hardcore) about being abandoned by his father, working briefly as a butler, and in 1998 travelled with his sister to Australia to meet {{him for the first}} time in nearly 30 years.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Manson {{appeared}} in Michael Moore's documentary, Bowling for Columbine; his appearance was filmed during the band's first show in Denver since the shooting. When Moore asked Manson {{what he would}} have said to the students at Columbine, he replied, [...] "I wouldn't say a single word to them. I would listen to what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and that's what no one did." ...|$|E
60|$|The youths {{went back}} to the auto and told of their adventure. Sam and the girls listened with {{interest}} <b>to</b> what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{believe that}} Hist and Chingachgook would sleep until <b>they</b> <b>had</b> told {{each other all}} <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> after so long a separation--do you, sister?" ...|$|R
60|$|They silenced his objections, {{and sent}} for Grenfell, who {{appeared}} disconcerted {{for a moment}} when he heard what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Then he laughed somewhat harshly.|$|R
2500|$|Former federal {{prosecutor}} Paul Butler contrasted the way police treat a civilian suspect of [...] "a horrible crime," [...] {{with the way}} they treat a police officer under the Maryland Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights. For a civilian, [...] "within the crucial first 24 hours after a crime," [...] they would read the suspect his Miranda warnings, and [...] "go to work," [...] sometimes with lies or threats. But a police officer gets 10 days before <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a word.|$|E
2500|$|Marilyn Manson {{was blamed}} {{by the media}} {{in the wake of}} the Columbine shooting, and responded to {{criticism}} in an interview with Michael Moore, in which he was asked, [...] "If you were to talk directly to the kids at Columbine and the people in the community, what would you say to them if they were here right now?", to which he replied, [...] "I wouldn't say a single word to them—I would listen to what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and that's what no one did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Earlier in 2001, {{the band}} {{released}} {{a cover of}} Gloria Jones' [...] "Tainted Love" [...] on the soundtrack to Not Another Teen Movie. The song became the band's biggest international hit yet, peaking at number one in numerous European territories. In 2002, Jonathan Davis of Korn invited Marilyn Manson to record vocals on a track titled [...] "Redeemer", which was released on his [...] to Queen of the Damned. Manson also appeared in Michael Moore's 2002 documentary, Bowling for Columbine; his appearance was filmed {{on the same day}} as their Denver Ozzfest performance. When Moore asked what Manson would have said to the students at Columbine, he replied, [...] "I wouldn't say a single word to them. I would listen to what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and that's what no one did." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} Dave insisted upon talking the matter over with Sam Barringford. They found the old hunter ready enough to listen <b>to</b> what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
60|$|Anyhow, {{there they}} were in a {{first-class}} carriage; and there was the collector at the door, looking indignantly at their second-class tickets, and waiting <b>to</b> hear what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> for themselves.|$|R
60|$|So {{the boys}} went {{together}} up to Wallace's room. They {{found him in}} his alcove as before. They advanced to the table, and Wallace looked up to them <b>to</b> hear what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
2500|$|On 16 August 1819 a {{crowd had}} {{assembled}} near Manchester {{to listen to}} a speech by Henry Hunt and was run down by the yeomanry cavalry, with fifteen dead as a result. Fitzwilliam's first reaction to [...] "Peterloo" [...] was cautious. He wrote on 24 August: [...] "I see they are making much of what has happened in Manchester, in London. No doubt much may be said against interfering with a legal meeting...but circumstances may arise to call for the intervention of the magistrates even on such occasions, and to be impartial, one must hear what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> for themselves". On 5 October Fitzwilliam wrote to Lady Ponsonby: [...] "If we do not set this matter to rights, the military are henceforward the governing power in the British Empire". At the county meeting of Yorkshire held on 14 October, Fitzwilliam was represented by his son Lord Milton, and it adopted the resolutions drafted by Fitzwilliam: the right to public assembly and condemnation of unlawful interference with it, and a demand for an inquiry into Peterloo. Fitzwilliam's objection, as he wrote on 17 October, was to: ...|$|E

60|$|Randy and Earl both spoke earnestly, {{and it was}} {{not their}} fault that what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> did not take effect. But Fred Dobson was both wild and reckless, and he shook his head.|$|R
5000|$|After the Roadblock, teams <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{find one}} of four white VW-buses. When <b>they</b> <b>had</b> found one, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "Karanba" [...] to the driver, that the driver would drive them to their next destination.|$|R
60|$|Presently, as I was eating, {{my uncle}} and Mrs. Canby joined me. They {{were full of}} advice {{as to what to}} do and what to avoid, and I listened <b>to</b> all <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> attentively.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll go {{and have}} a look at it after dinner," [...] {{observed}} Ned; [...] "meanwhile, here are our comrades, let us hear what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the proposal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You know dear, it doesn't hurt me to {{hear what}} <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> And if they really are in trouble--well, it is my duty {{to help them out}} of it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Miss Stackpole, [...] "I {{like to see}} all sides. I don't {{approve of}} a privileged class, but I like to hear what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> for themselves." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{were shown}} {{into the inner}} office, where a gray-haired gentleman listened gravely <b>to</b> what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Then he took the salvage claim from Jordan, and laid it beneath a pile of other papers.|$|R
60|$|Then {{proclamation}} was made, that <b>they</b> that <b>had</b> aught <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{for their}} lord the king against the prisoner at the bar, should forthwith appear and give in their evidence. So there came in three witnesses, to wit, Envy, Superstition, and Pickthank. They {{were then asked}} if they knew the prisoner at the bar; and what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> for their lord the king against him.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not long}} before the migratory medical man was brought to the Princess. There was nothing the matter with her, but she liked to meet with persons of skill and {{learning}} <b>to</b> hear what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
60|$|ROBERTS. Gad! If I was {{to begin}} to tell ye all <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> I wouldn't be {{finished}} to-day. And there'd be some that'd wish they'd never left their London palaces.|$|E
60|$|When, therefore, {{children}} come with any request, or express any wish, {{in cases where}} no serious interests are involved, in deciding upon the answer to be given, the mother should, in general, simply ask herself, not Is it wise? Will they succeed in it? Will they enjoy it? Would I {{like to do it}} if I were they?--but simply, Is there any harm or danger in it? If not, readily and cordially consent. But do not announce your decision till after you have heard all that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> if you intend to hear what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> at all.|$|E
60|$|But {{although}} {{the notion of}} an absolute criterion is chimerical, there may be relative criteria, which increase the probability of truth. Common sense and science hold that there are. Let us see what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
60|$|After {{talking the}} matter over among themselves, the boys {{decided to tell}} Mr. Endicott about the piece of Mexican halter <b>they</b> <b>had</b> picked up. He listened gravely <b>to</b> what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> {{and looked at the}} bit of leather curiously.|$|R
