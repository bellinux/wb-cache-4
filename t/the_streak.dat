5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>streak,</b> the Elias Sports Bureau {{changed its}} {{criteria}} for the official consecutive scoreless innings record for starting pitchers from including fractional innings in which one or two outs had been recorded to counting only complete scoreless innings. Since <b>the</b> <b>streak</b> was active {{at the end of}} the 1988 season, it would have spanned two separate seasons if Hershiser had pitched any additional scoreless innings to begin the next year. However, he yielded a run in his first inning of the 1989 season, thus ending <b>the</b> <b>streak.</b> <b>The</b> <b>streak</b> only includes innings pitched in the regular season, excluding eight scoreless innings Hershiser pitched to start Game 1 of the 1988 National League Championship Series on October 4 (unofficially extending his streak to 67 combined innings). Although he completed the ninth inning in each start, the streak's final game lasted 16 innings, of which he only pitched the first ten. Thus, Hershiser did not match Drysdale's record of six consecutive complete game shutouts. Like Drysdale's streak, the penultimate game of Hershiser's streak was a Dodgers–Giants game that featured a controversial umpire's ruling that saved <b>the</b> <b>streak.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} of {{numerical}} simulations and theoretical classical analysis of time delays {{with respect to}} the instant of ionization in a numerical streaking experiment. These results confirm our previous interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>streaking</b> time delay as a finite-range and field-weighted time delay. We show that in <b>the</b> <b>streaking</b> experiments <b>the</b> time delay strongly depends on the parameters of <b>the</b> <b>streaking</b> field. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>streaking</b> time delay is accumulated over a finite range in space, which the emitted electron probes after its transition into the continuum until <b>the</b> <b>streaking</b> pulse ceases. Moreover, we confirm by results of our numerical simulations that <b>the</b> <b>streaking</b> time delay can be understood as a sum (or integral) over field-free time delays weighted by the relative instantaneous field strength during the propagation of the photoelectron.

5000|$|Avian {{gastrulation}} {{occurs as}} cells move though <b>the</b> primitive <b>streak.</b> Hence, primitive streak {{is analogous to}} the blastopore lip in amphibian gastrulation. [...] <b>The</b> primitive <b>streak</b> develops from Koller’s sickle and the epiblast of the avian embryo. As the cells of Koller’s sickle migrate during gastrulation, they form different portions of <b>the</b> primitive <b>streak.</b> <b>The</b> anterior cells of Koller’s sickle become the anterior region of <b>the</b> primitive <b>streak,</b> known as Hensen's node. Similarly, the posterior cells of Koller’s sickle form the posterior region of <b>the</b> primitive <b>streak.</b> This differential movement is due to expression of different mesodermal marker genes among the cells located in different areas of Koller’s sickle. Chordin is expressed in cells of <b>the</b> anterior <b>streak,</b> while Wnt8c is expressed in cells of <b>the</b> posterior <b>streak.</b> <b>The</b> movement is coordinated by a Wnt signaling pathway which is activated by fibroblast growth factors from the hypoblast.|$|R
5|$|Favre and the Packers {{continued}} posting {{positive results}} {{through the next}} few seasons.

On August 2, with runners on first and second with one out in the eighth inning against the Philadelphia Phillies, he retired Chase Utley and Ryan Howard to help the Giants win 73. He won the final game of the season against San Diego by pitching two scoreless innings as the Giants won 43 in ten innings. Affeldt finished the season with a career best 1.73 ERA in seventyfour games. He was named tenth on one writer's ballot for MVP voting, placing him in a tie for twentyeighth on the list. On December 17, he won the This Year in Baseball Setup Man of the Year Award.|$|E

Another distraction during <b>the</b> <b>streak</b> was his wife's pregnancy and his son's childbirth complications. The record-setting game was overshadowed by the 1988 Summer Olympics, football, and baseball pennant races; it was not broadcast on local television in Los Angeles. Following the regular season, Hershiser was awarded the NL Cy Young Award. In the playoffs, he earned both the NL Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award and the World Series MVP Award. He also secured Sportsman of the Year and Associated Press Athlete of the Year honors. Hershiser appeared in the 1989 MLB All-Star Game and continued to be an effective pitcher for many seasons, including two additional appearances in the World Series, one of which was preceded by his winning the 1995 AL Championship Series MVP Award.|$|E

5|$|After much speculation, Manning {{announced}} in the offseason that he would return for his 18th season in the NFL. In the season opener against the Baltimore Ravens, Manning's play seemed to have deteriorated, going 24–40 for 175 yards and one interception, but a pick-6 by cornerback Aqib Talib allowed the Broncos to win 19–13. The Broncos {{got off to a}} dominant 7–0 start to the season; however, <b>the</b> <b>streak</b> ended in a loss at Indianapolis, losing 24–27. During that winning streak, and the loss in Indianapolis, Manning played better, putting up over 250 yards in six of the seven games, and he scored nine touchdowns. However, he never had a game without an interception, bringing his 8-game TD–INT ratio to 9–13, and the Broncos needed a hardworking defense to contribute for victories.|$|E

Happ raised his record to 7–0 on the season with another seven-inning shutout performance. <b>The</b> <b>streak</b> continued as the Phillies opened a series at home against the Chicago Cubs; Chad Durbin earned his first save in 11 months by pitching three scoreless innings of relief. Werth's three-run home run in the 13th inning the next night gave the Phillies a walk-off win for their tenth consecutive, but Chicago ended the season-high streak with a 10–5 defeat on July 22. The Phillies won three of their next four, and bolstered their rotation by trading for Cliff Lee. The 2008 American League Cy Young Award winner came from the Cleveland Indians along with outfielder Ben Francisco on July 29; the Phillies gave up four minor leaguers—catcher Lou Marson, infielders Jason Donald and pitchers Carlos Carrasco and Jason Knapp. Lee and Francisco joined the Phillies in San Francisco after the Phillies' series victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks, and both started the final game in July. Lee pitched a complete-game four-hitter on July 31, allowing one run over nine innings of work. The Phillies finished July with a 20–7 record, their first 20-win month since May 2001.|$|E

The last game of the trip, against the Montreal Canadiens, saw the team come back from a 4–0 deficit to force the contest into overtime before Montreal prevailed.
