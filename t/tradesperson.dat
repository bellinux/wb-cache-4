Further, there is usually a long list of claimants on any failed project. To avoid the specter of various trades, materialmen and suppliers attempting to remove the improvements they have made, and to maintain a degree of equality between the various lienors on a project, the statutory lien scheme was created. Without it, <b>Tradesperson</b> A may try to [...] "race" [...] Supplier B to the courthouse, the project site or the construction lender to obtain payment. Most lien statutes instead mandate strict compliance with the formalized process they create in return for the timely resolution and balancing of claims between all parties involved - both owners and lien claimants.|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} boom concentrated attention on skill shortages in Australia {{and their role}} in preventing the economy from reaching its full potential level of output and putting pressure on inflation. This paper concentrates {{on the extent to}} which the supply of <b>tradespersons</b> has adjusted to changed economic conditions and the regional dimension of these supply changes. While there is much anecdotal evidence on the regional dimension of skill shortages this has mainly focused on flows of labour into the resource-rich states of Western Australia and Queensland but there is no comprehensive analysis of the extent of the regional distribution of skilled labour, such as <b>tradespersons,</b> or the extent of changes in the population of <b>tradespersons</b> between regions as the economy as a whole and particular regions have experienced significant economic growth. This study uses mainly data from the Censuses of Population and Housing. The main finding of this paper is while socio economic factors affect the decision of <b>tradespersons</b> as to where to live and work, these effects appear limited. And while ever the issue of labour shortages for <b>tradespersons</b> exists, targeted immigration will have a role to play in reducing these deficiencies...|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} other trade {{qualifications}} for working on motor vehicles, including panel beater, spray painter, body builder and motorcycle mechanic. In most developed countries, these are separate trade courses, but a qualified <b>tradesperson</b> from one can change to working as another.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 30 years or so, {{there has been}} growing {{international}} interest in the "infon-nal sector" {{of the economy in}} developing countries, and there is now the recognition that to operate successfully as artisans in the informal sector, "apprentices" require a range of knowledge and skills. The general aim of the present, qualitative study, was to investigate how apprentices in informal sector enterprises in two trades (the Motor Vehicle trade and the Tie-dye trade) in The Gambia learn at the workplace and how such learning was facilitated. Twenty enterprises were selected for the study, ten in each trade. A variety of data collection methods were employed, namely, (a) individual, semistructured interviews of the entrepreneurs (who owned these enterprises), and of the apprentices, (b) observations of the <b>tradespersons</b> and apprentices at the workplace, (c) accounts of "critical events", and (d) documentary studies. The study has shown that (a) the <b>tradespersons</b> did not demonstrate to the apprentices the procedures for the tasks that they were undertaking, (b) the apprentices were not allowed to practise on the tasks that the <b>tradespersons</b> were contracted to und(rtake; (c) the apprentices practised their skills privately in their leisure time. (d) the <b>tradespersons</b> did not explain to the apprentices the theories underpinning the technical procedures; and for the apprentices, the term "theory" referred to the technical procedures, as such, rather than to the scientific and technological concepts and principles underpinning the procedures, (e) although the apprentices were often outwardly passive they did observe closely the <b>tradespersons</b> at work and made associative links with their own previous knowledge and experience. What has also emerged from the study is that apprentices' learning at the workplace in the informal sector is: (a) a multi-dimensional process, largely self-motivated and conditioned by the rigid hierarchical structure of the workplace. (b) (i) productivity-driven, (ii) atheoretical, (iii) unplanned, (iv) unstructured, (v) facilitated through role modelling. The study compared the concepts of learning which emerged from the study with the traditional concepts of learning and teaching in Vocational Training Institutions. This study has also shown that the <b>tradespersons</b> failed to assess formally competent performance at the workplace. There was no end-of-apprenticeship assessment for the apprentices in the Tie-dye trade; and in the Motor Vehicle trade, the assessment was adhoc. Importantly too, from the entrepreneurs' perspective, the workplace was about production and not about apprentice learning. The <b>tradespersons</b> were expected to concentrate on their jobs and not on training, {{in sharp contrast to the}} apprentices' expectation that the <b>tradespersons</b> should concentrate on skills training...|$|R
