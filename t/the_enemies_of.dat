5|$|A hairy and fiery star having {{then made}} its {{appearance}} for several days, the mathematicians declared {{that there would}} follow grievous pestilence, dearth and some great calamity. Calixtus, to avert the wrath of God, ordered supplications that if evils were impending for the human race He would turn all upon the Turks, <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> the Christian name.

5|$|By {{the time}} Musidora was exhibited, Etty's health was in serious decline. Suffering severe asthma, {{it was not}} unusual for passers-by to accuse him of {{drunkenness}} {{as he made his way}} wheezing through the London streets, and he was beginning to plan his retirement from polluted London to his beloved York. Abandoning the smaller paintings which kept him profitable, he strived to complete his Joan of Arc triptych before his health gave out. This was on a huge scale, 28ft (8.5m) in total width and 9ft 9in (3m) high; the three pictures from left to right depicted Joan devoting herself to the service of God and her country, Joan scattering <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> France, and Joan dying a martyr.|$|E
5|$|Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, {{agreed to}} an {{audience}} with the Electress Palatine in December 1711. He concluded that the Electress's succession brought no quandary, but added that he must succeed her. Cosimo and herself were abhorred by his reply. Realising how unforthcoming he had been, Charles wrote to Florence agreeing to the project, mentioning but one clause: the Tuscan state must not be bequeathed to <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> the House of Austria. At {{the culmination of the}} War of the Spanish Succession, at the Treaties of Utrecht and Rattstatt, Cosimo did not vie for international assurances for the Electress's succession. An inaction he would later grow to lament.|$|E
5000|$|Perfect is <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> good is an aphorism, an English {{variant of}} the older better is <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> good, which was popularized by Voltaire in French form.

5|$|From {{the death}} of Rognvald, Harald Maddadsson pursued a policy of {{supporting}} <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> the kings of Scotland, first Malcolm IV, who died young in 1165, then Malcolm's brother William. Of these enemies, those who were active {{in the north and}} west, where Harald's power was significant, were Somerled, king of Argyll and Hebrides (who married earl Harold's first cousin Ragnhild of the Isle of Man), the sons of Máel Coluim mac Alasdair, illegitimate son of King Alexander I, himself held prisoner at Roxburgh, the Meic Uilleim, the descendants of William fitz Duncan, and the MacHeths and dispossessed would-be Mormaers of Ross (who possibly were a branch of the ancient Loairn dynasty of Moray and claimants of its rights).|$|E

5|$|A {{circumstance}} {{occurred during}} the action which so strongly marks the invincible spirit of British seamen, when engaging <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> their country, that I cannot resist the pleasure I have in making it known to their Lordships; the Temeraire was boarded by accident; or design, by a French ship on one side, and a Spaniard on the other; the contest was vigorous, but, {{in the end the}} combined ensigns were torn from the poop and the British hoisted in their places. Collingwood's account, probably based largely on Harvey's report {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the battle, contained several errors. Temeraire had closely engaged two French ships, rather than a French and a Spanish ship, and had not been boarded by either during the action. Nevertheless, the account was popular and a print was rushed out purporting to show Harvey taking the lead in clearing Temeraires decks of enemy seamen.|$|E
5|$|A {{letter from}} Pope Adrian to Charlemagne survives which makes {{reference}} to Offa, but the date is uncertain; {{it may be}} as early as 784 or as late as 791. In it Adrian recounts a rumour that had reached him: Offa had reportedly proposed to Charlemagne that Adrian should be deposed, and replaced by a Frankish pope. Adrian disclaims all belief in the rumour, {{but it is clear}} it had been a concern to him. <b>The</b> <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> Offa and Charlemagne, described by Adrian as the source of the rumour, are not named. It is unclear whether this letter is related to the legatine mission of 786; if it predates it, then the mission might have been partly one of reconciliation, but the letter might well have been written after the mission.|$|E

5|$|During the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars that {{followed}} them, British {{dominance in the}} Indian Ocean was repeatedly challenged by the depredations of French vessels sailing from the isolated and well protected French colonies of Réunion (later Île Bonaparte) and Île de France. Although French Navy cruisers were periodically stationed on the islands, the majority of ships that preyed on British commerce from the islands were privateers, independently funded armed ships issued with letters of marque giving them permission to attack military and civilian ships belonging to <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> France. French naval strategy in the Indian Ocean was so reliant on privateers that entire squadrons developed, including a powerful force under the wealthy privateer captain Robert Surcouf. Although most privateers were small, carrying only a few cannon, some could be very large, rivalling professional warships in size. One such ship was the Bellone, which carried 34 guns, a crew of nearly 200 men and was commanded by Captain Jacques François Perroud, a notorious privateer who had caused significant damage to British trade in the Indian Ocean. In 1803, Perroud had gained significant notoriety with the capture of the valuable East Indiaman Lord Nelson on 14 August 1803.|$|E
5|$|In 1164-65 Manuel's cousin Andronikos, {{the future}} emperor, escaped from captivity in Byzantium and {{fled to the}} court of Yaroslav in Galicia. This situation, holding out the {{alarming}} prospect of Andronikos making a bid for Manuel's throne sponsored by both Galicia and Hungary, spurred the Byzantines into an unprecedented flurry of diplomacy. Manuel pardoned Andronikos and persuaded him to return to Constantinople in 1165. A mission to Kiev, then ruled by Prince Rostislav, resulted in a favourable treaty and a pledge to supply the Empire with auxiliary troops; Yaroslav of Galicia was also persuaded to renounce his Hungarian connections and return fully into the imperial fold. As late as 1200 the princes of Galicia were providing invaluable services against <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> the Empire, at that time the Cumans.|$|E
5|$|The Comanches {{were willing}} to fight <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> their new friends, and soon {{attacked}} the Karankawa. Over the next several years, the Comanches killed many of the Karankawa {{in the area and}} drove the others into Mexico. By 1804, very few natives lived on the barrier islands, where the Karankawa had made their home. In January 1790, the Comanche also helped the Spanish fight a large battle against the Mescalero and Lipan Apaches at Soledad Creek west of San Antonio. Over 1000Comanche warriors participated in raids against the Apache in 1791 and 1792, and the Apache were forced to scatter into the mountains in Mexico. In 1796, Spanish officials began an attempt to have the Apache and Comanche coexist in peace, and {{over the next ten years}} the intertribal fighting declined.|$|E

5|$|The {{love story}} between Berenice and Titus {{is also the}} premise of La clemenza di Tito (1734), an Italian opera with music by Antonio Caldara and a {{libretto}} by Pietro Metastasio that was later set to music by more than 40 other composers, including Johann Adolph Hasse (1735), Giuseppe Arena (1738), Francesco Corradini (1747), Christoph Willibald Gluck (1752), Andrea Adolfati (1753), Niccolò Jommelli (1753), Ignaz Holzbauer (1757), Vincenzo Legrezio Ciampi (1757), Gioacchino Cocchi (1760), Marcello Bernardini (1768), Andrea Bernasconi (1768), Pasquale Anfossi (1769), and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (La clemenza di Tito, 1791). More recently it {{was used as the}} backdrop for the Caroline Lawrence novels the Assassins of Rome and <b>the</b> <b>Enemies</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter. Lindsey Davis mentions it, though without making it the central plot line in novels such as Saturnalia. It is also the stimulus for the new ballet piece by Kim Brandstrup, 'Invitus Invitam' which premiered in the Royal Opera House in October 2010.|$|E
5|$|The raids {{continued}} periodically {{for almost}} three decades, until in 1749 when Spanish settlers and the Lipan Apache peoples made peace. But the treaty angered <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> the Apache, and resulted in raids on Spanish settlements by the Comanche, Tonkawa, and Hasinai tribes. Fear of Indian attacks and the remoteness of the area {{from the rest of}} the Viceroyalty discouraged settlers from moving to Texas. It remained one of the least-populated by immigrants provinces. The threat of attacks did not decrease until 1785, when Spain and the Comanche peoples made a peace agreement. The Comanche tribe later assisted in defeating the Lipan Apache and Karankawa tribes, who had continued to cause difficulties for settlers. An increase in the number of missions in the province allowed for a peaceful Indian reductions of other tribes, and by the end of the 18th century, only a few of the nomadic hunting and gathering tribes in the area had not been converted.|$|E
5|$|He took {{an active}} part in the battles against the Cossacks in the Khmelnytsky Uprising. On 16 May 1648 {{he was one of the}} many noble Polish prisoners who fell into the hands of Bohdan Khmelnytsky at the battle of Zhovti Vody, but he was quickly ransomed. He participated in the defense of the Kudak Fortress, which {{surrendered}} on 26 September; he was once again captured and not released until the autumn of 1649, in the aftermath of the Treaty of Zborov. He served as a porucznik in the hussar chorągiew of hetman Mikołaj Potocki, a military judge deputized by the hetman, and a member of his staff, meeting with the new king of Poland, John Casimir Vasa. He was part of the fighting at the battle of Berestechko and battle of Bila Tserkva in 1651. He received the title of chorąży of Sandomierz, and was elected the military deputy for the Sejm in January 1652. According to Nagielski, Czarniecki, while returning from the Sejm, witnessed the massacre of Polish prisoners in the aftermath of the battle of Batoh; This scene made him reject the notions that a compromise with <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> the Commonwealth was a likely or desired outcome. Podhorodecki however notes that another historian, Wojciech Jacek Długołecki, questions Czarniecki's presence there, and concludes that we have no conclusive proof whether Czarniecki was present at Batoh, The massacre further escalated the hostilities and the surrounding hatred; illustrating that is a letter Czariecki wrote soon after the battle, in which he promised that if enough military forces are gathered and given to him, he will leave few Ruthenians alive.|$|E

5|$|This {{time the}} mere {{presence}} of the Theban army was not enough to cow the opposition. Since time was passing and the Mantinean alliance showed no signs of capsizing, Epaminondas decided {{that he would have to}} break the stalemate. Hearing that a large Lacedaemonian force was marching to Mantinea, and that Sparta was practically undefended, he planned an audacious night-time march on Sparta itself. However, the Spartan king Archidamus was alerted to this move by an informant, probably a Cretan runner, and Epaminondas arrived to find the city well-defended.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 508510 Although he did attack the city, he seems to have drawn off relatively quickly on discovering that he had not, after all, surprised the Spartans. Furthermore, the Lacedaemonian and Mantinean troops which had been stationed at Mantinea had marched to Sparta during the course of the day, and dissuaded Epaminondas from attacking again. Now hoping that his adversaries had left Mantinea defenseless in their haste to protect Sparta, Epaminondas counter marched his troops back to his base at Tegea, and then dispatched his cavalry to Mantinea. However, a clash outside the walls of Mantinea with Athenian cavalry foiled this strategy as well.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 510512 Realising that the time allotted for the campaign was drawing to a close, and reasoning that if he departed without defeating <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> Tegea, Theban influence in the Peloponnesus would be destroyed, he decided to stake everything on a pitched battle.|$|E
