Lithographic results revealed stick-slip phenomena in both the fast and slow scan directions, verified {{with the aid of}} friction loop analysis. Varying the normal loading force, scan speed and resolution allowed the control of certain lithographic outcomes e. g., spacing and depth of troughs, and the dynamic stick-slip amplitude. The PDMS surface experienced significant in-plane deformation in response to the tip-induced lateral force. This displacement increased with increasing loading force, creating greater spacing between troughs in the slow scan direction. Simultaneous generation of a lateral displacement in the fast scan direction caused a decrease in <b>trough</b> <b>length</b> with increasing loading force due to an increase in static friction with normal force, resulting in a greater surfaces relaxation, and shorter track length of dynamic friction.

40|$|Summer in the Persian Gulf region {{presents}} physiological {{challenges for}} Australian sheep {{that are part}} of the live export supply chain coming from the Australian winter. Many feedlots throughout the Gulf have very high numbers of animals during June to August in order to cater for the increased demand for religious festivals. From an animal welfare perspective it is important to understand the necessary requirements of feed and water trough allowances, and the amount of pen space required, to cope with exposure to these types of climatic conditions. This study addresses parameters that are pertinent to the wellbeing of animals arriving in the Persian Gulf all year round. Three experiments were conducted in a feedlot in the Persian Gulf between March 2010 and February 2012, totalling 44 replicate pens each with 60 or 100 sheep. The applied treatments covered animal densities, feed-bunk <b>lengths</b> and water <b>trough</b> <b>lengths.</b> Weights, carcass attributes and health status were the key recorded variables. Weight change results showed superior performance for animal densities of ≥ 1. 2 m 2 /head during hot conditions (24 -h average temperatures greater than 33 °C, or a diurnal range of around 29 – 37 °C). However the space allowance for animals can be decreased, with no demonstrated detrimental effect, to 0. 6 m 2 /head under milder conditions. A feed-bunk length of ≥ 5 cm/head is needed, as 2 cm/head showed significantly poorer animal performance. When feeding at 90 % ad libitum 10 cm/head was optimal, however under a maintenance feeding regime (1 kg/head/day) 5 cm/head was adequate. A minimum water trough allowance of 1 cm/head is required. However, this experiment was conducted during milder conditions, and it may well be expected that larger water <b>trough</b> <b>lengths</b> would be needed in hotter conditions. Carcass weights were determined mainly by weights at feedlot entry and subsequent weight gains, while dressing percentage was not significantly affected by any of the applied treatments. There was no demonstrated effect of any of the treatments on the number of animals that died, or were classified as unwell. However, across all the treatments, these animals lost significantly more weight than the healthy animals, so the above recommendations, which are aimed at maintaining weight, should also be applicable for good animal health and welfare. Therefore, best practice guidelines for managing Australian sheep in Persian Gulf feedlots in the hottest months (June–August) which present the greatest environmental and physical challenge is to allow feed-bunk length 5 cm/head on a maintenance-feeding program and 10 cm/head for 90 % ad libitum feeding, and the space allowance per animal should be ≥ 1. 2 m 2 /head. Water trough allocation should be at least 1 cm/head with provision for more in the summer when water intake potentially doubles...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} elements of the nursery pen design, the feeder allows or not the optimisation of pigs' performance. Two principal design features can characterize a feeder : the way pigs will be fed (wet, dry or wet/dry) and its capacity, which depends in turn on the <b>trough</b> <b>length</b> {{or the number of}} feeding spaces (mono - or multi- space feeder and communal trough). To determine the number of pigs that can be accommodated per feeder, the daily time spent per pig at the feeder - depending on pig size and feed delivered - must be taken into account. Recommendations of 4 to 10 weaned pigs per feeding space are generally given. Pigs are able to adapt their eating behaviour when crowding occurs but suboptimal situations may reduce feed intake and productivity and even impair welfare. Some particularities of the feeder such as limited depth, feeder gap opening, lip height, side panels or protective crate can limit feed spillage and/ or agonistic interactions at the feeder. Feeder position in the pen should prevent pigs to be disturbed while eating and allow free movement of penmates. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{report on}} the design and {{performance}} of a novel 600 x high-concentration photovoltaic (HCPV) collector. The design is unique in that it diverges from the predominant HCPV approach of a 3 D concentrator mounted on a 2 -axis tracker. We consider minimization of the cost per m 2 of collecting aperture {{to be the most}} important aspect in achieving cost-competitiveness. Accordingly, we borrow from the knowledge of the more mature CSP industry which has shown the parabolic trough to be an effective and economical method to concentrate sunlight. To further leverage the advantages of scalability of trough geometries, the primary concentrator utilizes a construction based on inflated metalized polymer membranes as reflectors supported on modular concrete structures. With this design, aperture widths surpassing 10 m and trough lengths exceeding 200 m are possible. At a <b>trough</b> <b>length</b> of 200 m, the rated power of one collector is 500 kWp. To augment the concentration into the realm of HCPV, where use of high-efficiency triple-junction concentrator cells becomes economically viable, a novel secondary concentrating stage is employed, consisting of an array of tracking non-imaging concentrators arranged along the focal line of the primary. This two-stage line-to-point focus system allows for concentrations of over 600 x, considerably surpassing the 2 D limit of ∼ 200 x inherent to trough-like geometries, while maintaining the advantages of a one-axis tracking trough primary concentrator. A full-scale prototype of the system has been constructed in Biasca, Switzerland. Year-round solar-to-electrical efficiency is expected to exceed 25 %...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of group size and diet form on performance and feeding behavior of weaned pigs and to determine an optimal number of pigs per feeding space for pellets or meal provided in a tube feeder. Methods: During six consecutive trials, feeding behavior and performance of groups comprising 30 (G 30), 40 (G 40), or 50 (G 50) weaned pigs were compared for 6 weeks after weaning. A tube feeder was used for all groups, delivering either pellets or meal (<b>trough</b> <b>length</b> 64 cm; two integrated drinkers). Results: Mean ADG was 5 % higher when pigs were fed pellets rather than meal (P =. 06). Whatever the diet, ADG was lower in G 50 than in G 40 (P <. 05). In groups fed meal, ADG was lower in G 40 than in G 30 (P <. 001). Average time using the feeder was 4. 7 minutes per hour for pigs fed pellets, and 7. 3 minutes per hour for pigs fed meal (P =. 003). Overall feeder occupation rates during the day were 139 ± 30 % for meal and 93 ± 21 % for pellets (P =. 01), and during the night, 91 ± 33 % for meal and 54 ± 15 % for pellets (P =. 03), assuming 100 % is four pigs eating simultaneously during the observation period. Implications: Diet form influences the optimal number of pigs per feeder space. For the tube feeders in this study, the recommended maximum number of pigs per feeding space is 6. 5 for pigs fed meal and 10. 2 for pigs fed pellets...|$|E

The biggest advantage of solar energy compared with other forms of clean energy {{is that it can}} provide without any environmental pollution. In addition, Gaza Strip is facing continuous electricity cut off due to the encountered siege. Therefore, the current article presents a pilot project conducted in Islamic University of Gaza by Environmental Resources Sustainability Research Group (ERSRG) to use Concentrated Solar Power (CSP), to be as electricity provider. CSP consists of: solar field with solar transfer circuit (Parabolic Trough), storage system, and power plant block with turbine, generator and cooling circuit. This article presents the output of the experiment conducted {{in the first part of}} the system: parabolic trough. ERSRG made a design of the parabolic trough that able to generate 1 KW. To achieve this result, the medium temperature thermal output should be around 200 °C. Based on some computations taken from the literature, the parabolic <b>trough</b> <b>length</b> was 5 m, the width was 2. 5 m and the depth was 0. 75 m.

The experiment was conducted in July using oil and water separately. The temperature of the oil was 101 °C while for the water was 98 °C. The lack of thermal efficiency of the system and the large loss of energy was due to inaccuracy in reflection of solar energy, sun tracking system is manual, lack of smoothness mirrors and coating glass pipe was not available.

40|$|In this study, a new Tubular Solar Still (TSS) made of cheap, {{lightweight}} and locally 	acquisitioned materials was successfully designed for practical use, {{particularly in the}} 	remote or coastal areas of underdeveloped and developing countries to produce distilled 	water from saline water using solar energy. The new TSS consists of a trough, a frame 	and a tubular cover. Since the cover material of our old TSS, a vinyl chloride sheet, was 	a little heavy and cannot form into a desirable size easily, a polythene film was 	alternated as a new material for {{the cover of the}} new TSS. Consequently, the weight and 	cost of the new TSS were reduced by about 61 % and 92 % of the old one, respectively. 	The fabrication cost of a new TSS was only about 250 yen. These improvements also 	can help to assemble and repair of the new TSS easily and enables much more realistic 	use of the new TSS. 	The present study is concerned with the design of the new TSS as well as 	development of the theoretical models for evaporation from the water surface and for 	condensation on the inner surface of the tubular cover inside the TSS. As a result, two 	unique and independent theoretical models were developed and formulized. One is 	based on evaporation theory using the evaporative mass transfer coefficient, h_, and 	another is based on condensation theory using the condensative mass transfer coefficient, 	hcdha. The theoretical derivations of h_ and h_ are significant to enhance the 	applicability of the design of TSS, because these two coefficients were obtained 	empirically (do not have theoretical backgrounds) in our previous study. The 	evaporation model due to natural convection was formulized by a dimensional analysis 	taking account of the properties of the humid air inside the TSS. The condensation 	model was based on a film-wise condensation theory that takes into account of the 	thermal resistance of the humid air as an unsaturated vapor-gas mixture. 	Finally, a transient model to calculate the diurnal variation of the production rate was 	proposed using mass and energy balance equations incorporating the mass transfer 	coefficients (h_ and h_) and the heat transfer coefficients (h_, h_, h_, h_, h_, h_ 	and h_). The mass balance equations of the water in a trough and the water vapor in the 	humid air, and the energy balance equations of the water in the trough, trough, humid 	air and tubular cover were formulized, respectively. An explicit finite difference scheme 	was developed to predict the time variations of the water temperature, T_w, humid air 	temperature, T_, and tubular cover temperature, T_c, vapor density of the humid air, 	evaporation and condensation fluxes under arbitrary weather conditions. 	A few sets of laboratory experiments were carried out at the University of Fukui, 	Japan to evaluate the production performance, the evaporation and condensation 	coefficients, the trough heat transfer coefficients and to find out the effect of water 	depths, h_w, on the production performance of the TSS. It was revealed that the hourly 	evaporation, M_, was linearly proportional to the trough width, B, and the value of 	exponent m was 1 in M_ =ηB^m, regardless of the <b>trough</b> <b>length,</b> L, for 0. 49 ≤L≤ 1. 5 m. The 	evaporation coefficient was proportional to the temperature difference between the 	water in the trough and the tubular cover. The condensation coefficient due to the 	thermal resistance between the humid air and the condensate liquid film was inversely 	proportional to the dry air pressure fraction. 	To support the validity of the present transient model, field experiments were carried 	out in Fukui, Japan and in Muscat, Oman from June to July, 2008 in addition to the 	laboratory experiments. Two typical one-day data of July 5, 2008 (in Fukui, Japan) and 	July 13, 2008 (in Muscat, Oman) are presented. It was observed that the relative 	humidity of the humid air, RH_, was remarkably below 100 %, i. e. definitely not 	saturated in the daytime but was almost 100 % during the nights over the field 	experiments. The solar radiation is the most influential parameter on the productivity of 	TSS. It was established from both laboratory and field experimental results that h_w is 	also one of the influential parameters which affect the productivity. 	The output of the present transient model was compared with the field experimental 	data and proved that the model could precisely predict the diurnal profiles of T_w, T_, T_c 	and RH_. Consequently, the present evaporation and condensation models were quite 	satisfactory to the calculation accuracy of the hourly production flux. Our previous 	evaporation and condensation models (using empirical h_ and h_, respectively) 	slightly overestimated and underestimated the observed production flux, respectively. 	The conventional approach (Dunkle’s and Ueda’s models) developed for a basin-type 	solar still was not useful to predict the hourly production flux of a TSS. 	Finally, it is concluded that the present evaporation and condensation models are the 	most reliable tool for predicting the daily production of a TSS...|$|E

40|$|A large {{literature}} describes {{relationships between}} month of birth, birth weight, and gestation. These relationships are hypothesized {{to reflect the}} causal impact of seasonal environmental factors. However, recent work casts doubt on this interpretation by showing that mothers with lower socioeconomic status {{are more likely to}} give birth in months that are associated with poorer birth outcomes. Seasonality in the numbers of conceptions in different months can also induce a mechanical correlation between preterm birth and month of birth. This paper analyzes the seasonality of health at birth using a large sample of 647, 050 groups of US siblings representing 1, 435, 213 children.

Whether a component decays or grows, and how fast it grows is entirely a function of its wave number (a measure of how many peaks and <b>troughs</b> per unit <b>length)</b> and the radius of the original cylindrical stream.

These two characteristics {{are important}} for vibrotactile sensory perception. Vibrissae of most phocid seals exhibit a beaded morphology with repeated sequences of crests and <b>troughs</b> along their <b>length.</b> I comparatively characterized differences in vibrissae morphologies among phocid species with a beaded profile, phocid species with a smooth profile, and otariids with a smooth profile using traditional and geometric morphometric methods to test the hypothesis that vibrissal morphologies are species-specific manipulations of a common pattern.

Quadratic discriminant function analysis demonstrated that 79. 3, 97. 8 and 100 % of individuals could be correctly classified to taxon based on vibrissal shape variables in the traditional, geometric and combined morphometric analyses, respectively. At least three separate morphologies were identified since phocids with beaded vibrissae, phocids with smooth vibrissae, and otariids each occupied distinct morphospace in the geometric morphometric and combined data analyses. Another important characteristic that influences the transduction of vibrotactile information to the mechanoreceptors in the follicle-sinus complex is the materials properties of the vibrissae. Vibrissae were modeled as cantilever beams and flexural stiffness (EI) was measured to test the hypotheses that the shape of beaded vibrissae reduces flexural stiffness and that vibrissae are anisotropic (orientations differ in EI). Species were significantly different and smooth vibrissae were generally stiffer than beaded vibrissae. Beaded vibrissae decrease vibrations in flow, which, combined with lower flexural stiffness values, may enhance detection of small changes in flow from swimming prey. The anterior plane of the vibrissae is likely the most biologically significant in tracking hydrodynamic trails but had lower flexural stiffness values than the dorsoventral orientation. There is likely a complex interaction between shape and mechanical properties in pinniped vibrissae but the ecological and functional implications are currently unknown...|$|R
40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} {{outlines}} the use of power spectral density data for estimating the Fatigue Damage of structures or components subjected to random loading. Since rainflow cycle counting has been accepted {{as the best way}} of estimating the fatigue damage caused by random loadings, an obvious target was a method of obtaining the rainflow range distribution from the PSD. Such a solution is derived in this thesis. It forms the major part of the work presented and appears in chapter 5. The rest of the thesis deals with the following topics; Chapter 3 first presents some empirical solutions developed by other authors for the prediction of rainflow ranges from PSD's. An empirical solution developed by Dirlik in 1985 is then used to investigate the effect that stresses contained within a given frequency range have on fatigue damage when there are other frequencies present in the PSD plot. This {{can be thought of as}} 'fatigue damage potential'. Interactions between stresses in different frequency intervals are investigated and it is shown that the fatigue damage potential of one frequency interval is dependent not only on the magnitude of that interval but on the magnitudes of other frequency intervals present. This 'Interaction' effect within the PSD plot, is of specific interest because it can be used to determine the change of fatigue damage for any given structure or component when parts of the signal or PSD plot are altered. Chapter 4 is concerned with methods of regenerating a signal from a PSD in the form of a set of peaks and troughs. Work by Kowalewsld in 1963 is introduced which gives a solution for the joint distribution of peaks and troughs. This distribution can be used to generate a continuous set of adjacent peaks and <b>troughs,</b> of any <b>length,</b> using Monte-Carlo techniques. Approximations in this result are discussed, in comparison with the (distribution of times between) zero crossings problem. An improvement to this joint distribution of peak and troughs is given which uses an empirical solution for the distribution of 'ordinary ranges' (ranges between adjacent peaks and troughs). Chapter 5 forms the major part of the original work presented in this thesis and outlines a theoretical solution for the prediction of rainflow ranges using statistics computed directly from the power spectral density plot. The rainflow range mechanism is broken down into a set of logical criteria which can be analyzed using Markov process theory. The dependence between extremes in this instance is modelled using the prediction of the joint distribution of peaks and troughs proposed by Kowalewsld, and shown in chapter 4. Chapter 6 deals with the fatigue damage assessment and stress history determination of components when only limited samples of the service data are available. An investigation is carried out into the relative merits of time and frequency domain techniques. In particular, the effect of finite sample length was investigated with particular reference to the variance of fatigue predictions using both a rainflow count on a limited time sample and a rainflow count produced directly from a PSD of the same time sample. The frequency domain approach is shown to be at least as accurate as the direct time domain approach. Chapter 7 deals with one specific area where the methods presented in this thesis are applicable, namely, dynamically sensitive offshore structures. Various methods of fatigue damage assessment are highlighted, followed by a detailed description of the 'deterministic/spectral' approach. Many factors which have not previously been recognised are investigated and shown to have significant effect, for instance, tidal effects...|$|R
