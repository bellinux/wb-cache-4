5000|$|<b>Token</b> <b>bus</b> was {{standardized}} by IEEE standard 802.4. It {{is mainly}} used for industrial applications. <b>Token</b> <b>bus</b> {{was used by}} General Motors for their Manufacturing Automation Protocol (MAP) standardization effort. [...] This is an application of the concepts used in token ring networks. The main {{difference is that the}} endpoints of the bus do not meet to form a physical ring.|$|E
50|$|All end {{stations}} {{connected to}} the same <b>token</b> <b>bus</b> {{are part of the}} same network segment.|$|E
50|$|FDDI {{provides}} a 100 Mbit/s optical standard for data transmission in {{local area network}} that can extend in range up to 200 km. Although FDDI logical topology is a ring-based token network, it {{did not use the}} IEEE 802.5 token ring protocol as its basis; instead, its protocol was derived from the IEEE 802.4 <b>token</b> <b>bus</b> timed token protocol. In addition to covering large geographical areas, FDDI local area networks can support thousands of users. FDDI offers both a Dual-Attached Station (DAS), counter-rotating token ring topology and a Single-Attached Station (SAS), <b>token</b> <b>bus</b> passing ring topology.|$|E
25|$|Local stores, saloons and mercantiles would issue {{their own}} tokens as well, usable {{only in their}} own shops. Railways and public {{transport}} agencies have used fare tokens for years to sell rides in advance at a discount. Many transport organizations still offer their own <b>tokens</b> for <b>bus</b> and subway services, toll bridges, tunnels, and highways, although the use of computer-readable tickets has replaced these in most areas.|$|R
50|$|Rolls of 20 BeeLine <b>bus</b> <b>tokens</b> were {{available}} directly from Current bus drivers. One-way transfers were also available and are good on local routes only when transferring between buses at the Brattleboro Transportation Center.|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} and verification of the delay-compensation algorithm are addressed. The delay compensator has been experimentally verified at an IEEE 802. 4 network testbed for velocity {{control of a}} DC servomotor. The performance of the delay-compensation algorithm was also examined by combined discrete-event and continuous-time simulation of the flight control system of an advanced aircraft that uses the SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) linear <b>token</b> passing <b>bus</b> for data communications...|$|R
50|$|The second {{convention}} is also followed by numerous authors (e.g., William Stallings) {{as well as}} by IEEE 802.4 (<b>token</b> <b>bus)</b> and lower speed versions of IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet) standards. It states that a logic 0 is represented by a high-low signal sequence and a logic 1 is represented by a low-high signal sequence.|$|E
50|$|Stations on a {{token ring}} LAN are logically {{organized}} {{in a ring}} topology with data being transmitted sequentially from one ring station to the next with a control token circulating around the ring controlling access. Similar token passing mechanisms are used by ARCNET, <b>token</b> <b>bus,</b> 100VG-AnyLAN (802.12) and FDDI, and they have theoretical advantages over the CSMA/CD of early Ethernet.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{promoted}} {{and used}} by manufacturers such as General Motors, Boeing, and others, it lost market share to the contemporary Ethernet standard and was not widely adopted. Difficulties included changing protocol specifications, the expense of MAP interface links, and the speed penalty of a token-passing network. [...] The <b>token</b> <b>bus</b> network protocol used by MAP became standardized as IEEE standard 802.4 but this committee disbanded in 2004 {{due to lack of}} industry attention.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{analytical}} {{models were}} derived {{for the performance}} evaluation of Local Area Networks (LANs) using actual network specification. The performance parameters considered are: maximum achieveable node data rate, average message delay, average node buffer size, maximum number of nodes the network can support, and the network saturation message rate to a node. Performance models were developed for the CSMA-CD, <b>token</b> passing <b>bus,</b> <b>token</b> passing ring, and PBX types networks. The message service disciplines considered are: the packet service discipline (the transmission of the first packet in a user queue), and the byte service discipline (the transmission of all bytes accumulated in a user queue);To facilitate {{the use of the}} derived analytical models, a software tool was developed for the performance evaluation and comparison of LANs. Application of the software tool in generating performance and comparison results for Ethernet, Arcnet, Ringnet, and CBX are included. The evaluation results indicated that none of the selected LANs is always the best or the poorest in performance...|$|R

50|$|Still as an Electrical Engineering student, {{he was one}} of {{the winners}} of the first Portuguese Mathematics Mini-Olympics, {{organized}} by the Portuguese Mathematics Society in 1980. Also as a B.Sc. student, he was involved in the design of the first Portuguese personal computer, ENER 1000, in the early 1980s, and later, during his M.Sc., developed the network interface card for this computer, which implemented a <b>token</b> <b>bus</b> medium access control protocol entirely developed by him.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{difficulties}} handling device failures and adding new stations to a network, token ring {{gained a reputation}} for being unreliable and difficult to upgrade. Bus networks, such as Ethernet, had a more flexible and reliable physical architecture, but Ethernet's access protocol could not absolutely guarantee a maximum time any station would have to wait to access the network, so was thought to be unsuitable for manufacturing automation applications. The <b>Token</b> <b>bus</b> protocol was created to combine the benefits of a physical bus network with the deterministic access protocol of a token ring network.|$|E
5000|$|A {{design of}} FMS {{communication}} [...] that supports a real time communication with bounded message delay and reacts promptly to any emergency signal is needed. Because of machine failure and malfunction due to heat, dust, and electromagnetic interference is common, a prioritized mechanism and immediate transmission of emergency messages are needed {{so that a}} suitable recovery procedure can be applied. A modification of standard <b>Token</b> <b>Bus</b> to implement a prioritized access scheme was proposed to allow transmission of short and periodic messages with a low delay compared to the one for long messages.|$|E

The first machine is a multidimensional multilink system. Three variations of this system with four, eight and nine computing elements are functional. The software environment for this machine provides a general purpose interface to any programming language. The second machine has been built using 16 CEs connected in a tree topology. This machine uses FIFO links for interprocessor communications. The third machine is a coarse grain data flow machine and has a dual <b>token</b> broadcast <b>bus</b> architecture.

Multiple tokens or combinations of tokens and cash are accepted for journeys requiring higher fares. Tokens are promoted as being easier to handle than cash, and also include discounts. For example, {{a package of}} tokens includes 2 free rides assuming the others are worth $2 each (adult) or $1.25 each (youth).|$|R
50|$|The Family Development Program helps {{families}} become self-reliant {{by providing}} short-term assistance to resolve immediate crises, such as help paying for rent or <b>bus</b> <b>tokens,</b> followed by continued support {{to assist them}} in attaining financial stability and self-reliance. Support includes haircuts for job applicants, help with resumes and references.The program works with families to increase their potential for social and financial self-sufficiency through goal setting, case management, self-empowerment/self-esteem training, and advocacy assistance.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Token</b> <b>bus</b> is {{a network}} {{implementing}} the token ring protocol over a [...] "virtual ring" [...] on a coaxial cable. A token is passed around the network nodes {{and only the}} node possessing the token may transmit. If a node doesn't have anything to send, the token is {{passed on to the}} next node on the virtual ring. Each node must know the address of its neighbour in the ring, so a special protocol is needed to notify the other nodes of connections to, and disconnections from, the ring.|$|E
50|$|MelsecNet {{protocol}} has two variants. MELSECNET/H and {{its predecessor}} MELSECNET/10 use high speed and redundant functionality to give deterministic delivery of large data volumes. Both variants can use either coaxial bus type or optical loop type for transmission. Coaxial bus type uses the <b>token</b> <b>bus</b> method with overall distance of 500 m but optical loop type uses the token ring method and can support a distance up to 30 km. MELSECNET/H can support {{a maximum of}} 19,200 bytes/frame and maximum communication speed of 25 Mbit/s. MELSECNET/10 supports 960 bytes/frame and a baud rate of 10 Mbit/s. Mitsubishi provides a manual for both the variants Melsecnet/H and MelsecNet/10.|$|E
50|$|Original Ethernet's shared {{coaxial cable}} (the shared medium) traversed a {{building}} or campus to every attached machine. A scheme known as {{carrier sense multiple access}} with collision detection (CSMA/CD) governed {{the way the}} computers shared the channel. This scheme was simpler than competing token ring or <b>token</b> <b>bus</b> technologies. Computers are connected to an Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) transceiver, which is in turn connected to the cable (with thin Ethernet the transceiver is integrated into the network adapter). While a simple passive wire is highly reliable for small networks, it is not reliable for large extended networks, where damage to the wire in a single place, or a single bad connector, can make the whole Ethernet segment unusable.|$|E

Industrial buttons often went through some extent of [...] "tuning", such as scraping or slicing off layers or trimming playing edges. The same {{was done to}} pieces such as <b>bus</b> <b>tokens,</b> atop which clothes buttons were glued. Goal tenders were most often than not matchboxes about 6 by 4 cm filled with molten lead slabs for stability.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} and test of various equipment {{was conducted to}} determine its state of repair and suitability {{for use in a}} test-bed computer network (to be used to simulate a space station configuration of computers for control and monitoring). A research study was also made of various network types, including the IEEE network standards: (1) Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection. (2) <b>Token</b> Passing <b>Bus</b> (3) <b>Token</b> Passing Ring, and (4) the draft ANSI standard for a High Speed Local Network, CSMA with Collision Avoidance. No firm conclusions are possible at this time as to which would be most suitable. An evaluation of the user interface of a space station database program, FREDSS (Formatted Retrieval and Entry of Data for Space Station, preliminary version), was also conducted and recommendations were made for possible improvements...|$|R

5000|$|However, since 802.3 (Ethernet) and 802.4 (<b>Token</b> <b>Bus)</b> {{send the}} bits over the wire with least {{significant}} bit first, while 802.5 (Token Ring) and 802.6 (FDDI) send the bits over the wire with most significant bit first, confusion may arise where an OUI in the latter scenario is represented with bits reversed from the canonical representation. So for instance, an OUI whose canonical form is [...] could be seen written as [...] if translation is done improperly or inconsistently. The latter form (Bit-Reversed or Noncanonical representation), may also be {{referred to in the}} literature as [...] "MSB format", [...] "IBM format", or [...] "Token Ring format" [...] for this reason. RFC2469 explains the problem in more detail.|$|E
5000|$|In February 1980, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) started project 802 to {{standardize}} local area networks (LAN). The [...] "DIX-group" [...] with Gary Robinson (DEC), Phil Arst (Intel), and Bob Printis (Xerox) submitted the so-called [...] "Blue Book" [...] CSMA/CD specification {{as a candidate}} for the LAN specification. In addition to CSMA/CD, Token Ring (supported by IBM) and <b>Token</b> <b>Bus</b> (selected and henceforward supported by General Motors) were also considered as candidates for a LAN standard. Competing proposals and broad interest in the initiative led to strong disagreement over which technology {{to standardize}}. In December 1980, the group was split into three subgroups, and standardization proceeded separately for each proposal.|$|E
50|$|The {{demands for}} {{reliable}} FMS protocol that support all the FMS data characteristics are now urgent. The existing IEEE standard protocols {{do not fully}} satisfy the real time communication requirements in this environment. The delay of CSMA/CD is unbounded {{as the number of}} nodes increases due to the message collisions. <b>Token</b> <b>Bus</b> has a deterministic message delay, but it does not support prioritized access scheme which is needed in FMS communications. Token Ring provides prioritized access and has a low message delay, however, its data transmission is unreliable. A single node failure which may occur quite often in FMS causes transmission errors of passing message in that node. In addition, the topology of Token Ring results in high wiring installation and cost.|$|E
50|$|The King of Prussia Transit Center {{is located}} at the King of Prussia Mall next to JCPenney. A mall {{entrance}} adjacent to the transit center provides access to the lower level of The Plaza.
