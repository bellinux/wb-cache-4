5|$|After several {{case reports}} in the 18th and 19th centuries, {{periodic}} paralysis was first described in full by the German neurologist Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal (1833–1890) in 1885. In 1926 the Japanese physician Tetsushiro Shinosaki, from Fukuoka, observed <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of thyroid disease in Japanese people with periodic paralysis. The first English-language report, in 1931, originated from Dunlap and Kepler, physicians at the Mayo Clinic; they described the condition in a patient with features of Graves' disease. In 1937 periodic paralysis was linked with hypokalemia, as well as precipitation of attacks with glucose and insulin. This phenomenon {{has been used as}} a diagnostic test.|$|E
5|$|During the {{communist}} era, rapid urbanization {{and growth of}} heavy industry occurred. Whole villages in the coal mining areas were destroyed by the mining activity. These conditions quickened the assimilation of the Poles. Another cause of assimilation was <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of intermarriage. Besides Poles belonging to the minority, many more commuted {{across the border from}} Polish People's Republic to work in Czechoslovakia or {{to take advantage of the}} relative abundance of consumer goods in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|Keogh {{became the}} star of the tour, and played in at least 60 of the side's 74 matches in the British Isles. The {{schedule}} was grueling, with their matches played in only 175 days. They arrived in early October 1888, and by late November the team was regularly fielding injured players due to <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of injuries. In December the team played two internationals, against Ireland and Wales, with Keogh appearing in both.|$|E

5|$|The {{first few}} years of the {{federation}} were characterised by a relatively peaceful political atmosphere and a booming economy. The government's coffers were kept full through revenue from Northern Rhodesia's copper mines, and overseas investment saw the rapid expansion of the cities of Salisbury, Bulawayo and Lusaka. High-standard tar roads replaced dirt tracks and the railway system was expanded. Welensky credited <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of development to the astute management of the federal Minister of Finance, Donald Macintyre.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of {{test animal}} {{survival}} {{was due in}} part to the nature of single-pulse radiation. As with the two Los Alamos criticality accidents involving the earlier demon core, victims who were close enough to receive a lethal dose died, while those farther away recovered and survived. Also, all the mice were placed outside the expected lethal zone in order to study possible mutations in future generations.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, a U.S. Border Patrol {{checkpoint}} {{was opened}} near Dulzura, to combat human and drug trafficking that used SR94, {{as well as}} fatal traffic accidents resulting from such smuggling. Two years later, following a proposal to widen SR94 from Otay Lakes Road to SR188 to address <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of accidents, local residents raised concerns about this proposal. In July1998, the Back Country Coalition sued Caltrans concerning the short length of the environmental impact report as well as not soliciting comments from the public; opponents pushed for a ban of all trucks on the highway. Caltrans agreed to hold another hearing in an out-of-court settlement, {{as well as to}} pay $20,000 for the attorneys. In March1999, Caltrans agreed to delay the construction for several years to evaluate the environmental impact. During the early 2000s, the interchange with SR125 was reconstructed to allow for the extension of the latter freeway south to SR54, which was finished in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} stable OHS, the most {{important}} treatment is weight loss—by diet, through exercise, with medication, or sometimes weight loss surgery (bariatric surgery). This {{has been shown to}} improve the symptoms of OHS and resolution of the high carbon dioxide levels. Weight loss may take a long time and is not always successful. Bariatric surgery is avoided if possible, given <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of complications, but may be considered if other treatment modalities are ineffective in improving oxygen levels and symptoms. If the symptoms are significant, nighttime positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment is tried; this involves the use of a machine to assist with breathing. PAP exists in various forms, and the ideal strategy is uncertain. Some medications have been tried to stimulate breathing or correct underlying abnormalities; their benefit is again uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{popular as}} a caged {{bird in the}} 19th century, the {{turquoise}} parrot was rarely seen in captivity between 1928 and 1956, the main problem being <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of infertile eggs. It has become more common since, and has adapted readily to aviculture. A quiet species, it likes to bathe in captivity. There is a possibility of interbreeding {{with other members of}} the genus Neophema if caged together. Specimens with more prominent orange bellies have been bred, sourced from wild birds in New South Wales and not from breeding with scarlet-chested parrots. A yellow form, where the blue pigment is lost and yellow and red pigments are conserved, first appeared in the 1950s in aviculture. It is a recessive mutation. Other colour forms seen are a red-fronted and pied form (both recessive), and jade and olive (dominant).|$|E

5|$|The M249 {{light machine}} gun (LMG), {{formerly}} designated the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW) and formally written as Light Machine Gun, 5.56mm, M249, is the American adaptation of the Belgian FN Minimi, a {{light machine gun}} manufactured by the Belgian company FN Herstal (FN). The M249 is manufactured in the United States by the local subsidiary FN Manufacturing LLC in South Carolina and is widely used in the U.S. Armed Forces. The weapon was introduced in 1984 after being judged the most effective {{of a number of}} candidate weapons to address the lack of automatic firepower in small units. The M249 provides infantry squads with <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of fire of a machine gun combined with accuracy and portability approaching that of a rifle.|$|E
5|$|Infant {{mortality}} rates are high, and life expectancy at birth is 50.03years. Abortion is illegal in Malawi. The Penal Code punishes women who seek illegal or clinical abortion with 14 years and 7 years in prison. There {{is a high}} adult prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS, with an estimated 980,000adults (or 9.1% of the population) living with the disease in 2015. There are approximately 27,000deaths each year from HIV/AIDS, and over half a million children orphaned because of the disease (2015). Approximately 250new people are infected each day, and at least 70% of Malawi's hospital beds are occupied by HIV/AIDS patients. <b>The</b> <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of infection has resulted in an estimated 5.8% of the farm labor force dying of the disease. The government spends over $120,000 each year on funerals for civil servants who die of the disease. In 2006, international superstar Madonna started Raising Malawi, a foundation that helps AIDS orphans in Malawi, and also financed a documentary about the hardships experienced by Malawian orphans, called I Am Because We Are. Raising Malawi also works with the Millennium Villages Project to improve education, health care, infrastructure and agriculture in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of mining increased {{the migration of}} native African people in search of employment to the province from elsewhere in Africa. The mining industry improved {{the standard of living}} of those living along Northern Rhodesia's railroads, and increased the influx of white people, the Europeans from South Africa who wanted to maintain their superiority over the native African population. Native Africans were poorly treated by the whites and discouraged from working in the mines; this evolved into a racial struggle. <b>The</b> <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of immigration to the region increased the number of unplanned settlements. The BSAC introduced a hut tax in 1901 in North-Eastern Rhodesia and between 1904 and 1913 in North-Western Rhodesia for all migrants. The tax was high (in some cases, six months' wages), and intended to create a system of debt bondage and generate income for investment in other mines. Unrest caused by tax increases was suppressed {{with the help of the}} British South Africa Police. The imposition of tax was a strategy adopted to create bond labour and sustain demand during the 1920s when the demand for miners was higher. The company was able to maintain low wages on account of predominance of migrant labour from rural regions. The African miners had three major issues: low wages compared to European miners, a prohibition against working in mines reserved for Europeans despite high skills, and workplace harassment and brutality.|$|E

5|$|While TBI may {{be managed}} without surgery, {{surgical}} repair of the tear is considered {{standard in the}} treatment of most TBI. It is required if a tear interferes with ventilation; if mediastinitis (inflammation of the tissues in the mid-chest) occurs; or if subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema progresses rapidly; or if air leak or large pneumothorax is persistent despite chest tube placement. Other indications for surgery are a tear more than one third the circumference of the airway, tears with loss of tissue, and a need for positive pressure ventilation. Damaged tissue around a rupture (e.g. torn or scarred tissue) may be removed in order to obtain clean edges that can be surgically repaired. Debridement of damaged tissue can shorten the trachea by as much as 50%. Repair of extensive tears can include sewing a flap of tissue taken from the membranes surrounding the heart or lungs (the pericardium and pleura, respectively) over the sutures to protect them. When lung tissue is destroyed as a result of TBI complications, pneumonectomy or lobectomy (removal of a lung or of one lobe, respectively) may be required. Pneumonectomy is avoided whenever possible due to <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of death associated with the procedure. Surgery to repair a tear in the tracheobronchial tree can be successful even when it is performed months after the trauma, as can occur if the diagnosis of TBI is delayed. When airway stenosis results after delayed diagnosis, surgery is similar to that performed after early diagnosis: the stenotic section is removed and the cut airway is repaired.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} of ctenophores {{to the rest}} of Metazoa is very important {{to our understanding of the}} early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity. It has been the focus of debate for many years. Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria, sister to the Cnidaria, sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria, and sister to all other animals. A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera and Placozoa) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest-diverging animal taxon instead. As such, the Ctenophora appear to be a basal diploblast clade. In agreement with the latter point, the analysis of a very large sequence alignment at the metazoan taxonomic scale (1,719 proteins totalizing ca. 400,000 amino acid positions) showed that ctenophores emerge as the second-earliest branching animal lineage, and sponges are sister-group to all other multicellular animals. Another study strongly rejects the hypothesis that sponges are the sister group to all other extant animals and establishes the placement of Ctenophora as the sister group to all other animals, and disagreement with the last-mentioned paper is explained by methodological problems in analyses in that work.|$|E
