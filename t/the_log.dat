5|$|The badnjak {{should not}} be jumped over or trodden upon, and blowing on its fire is avoided. It {{should not be}} moved when about to burn through, lest <b>the</b> <b>log</b> break at the place most {{consumed}} by the fire, which is usually strongest {{at the center of}} the fireplace; the separation of <b>the</b> <b>log</b> should be a result of the fire only. None of the family members should fall asleep before <b>the</b> <b>log</b> splits, otherwise some of them may die in the coming year, without warning.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>log</b> {{church was}} moved from its {{original}} location in the south corner of the cemetery to a hill {{across the road from}} the brick church. It was used as a sexton's house for the church, and was a Sunday school classroom for about 30 years. In addition to religious instruction, <b>the</b> <b>log</b> building was a public schoolhouse. Future West Virginia governor Herman G. Kump and his brother, the judge Garnett Kerr Kump, received part of their primary education in the schoolhouse. By 1885, a Mr. Miller was teaching business principles at the school. <b>The</b> <b>log</b> building succumbed to the elements, and no longer exists.|$|E
5|$|Collier's fleet {{arrived at}} the mouth of the river early on August 13. He boarded 123 marines onto the Hope, and ordered her and the Blonde up the river. Word of this reached the militia, and thrty-five men mustered to oppose them. The ships reached <b>the</b> <b>log</b> boom, and a firefight began between the two forces. The militia {{resistance}} was sufficient to keep the British from attempting a landing that day. Early the next morning, under the cover of fog, the marines were landed. They cut <b>the</b> <b>log</b> boom, seized a sloop carrying lumber, and set fire to a storehouse, seizing stores of flour, rice, corn, shoes, and ammunition before returning to the ships.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>logging</b> {{framework}} maintains <b>the</b> current <b>logging</b> {{level for}} each logger. <b>The</b> <b>logging</b> level {{can be set}} more or less restrictive. For example, if <b>the</b> <b>logging</b> level is set to [...] "WARNING", then all messages of that level or higher are logged, ERROR and FATAL.|$|R
50|$|To load <b>the</b> <b>logs,</b> <b>the</b> truck may {{be fitted}} {{with one or}} more winches or cranes. <b>The</b> <b>logs</b> are {{commonly}} unloaded by letting them roll off sideways.|$|R
500|$|During operation, fully {{cooked meat}} or cheese logs arrive sealed in {{impermeable}} casings. [...] <b>The</b> <b>logs</b> {{go through a}} casing sanitation step that involves being treated with a sanitizing liquid before the casings are removed from <b>the</b> <b>logs.</b> [...] <b>The</b> <b>logs</b> then undergo a postlethality treatment by passing through an infrared pasteurization tunnel to kill pathogens on <b>the</b> <b>logs.</b> [...] <b>The</b> <b>logs</b> are then mechanically transferred to slicers, sliced, and placed in sealed packages that are transferred out of the processing cell. [...] The mechanical transfers decrease the risk of product contamination by reducing handling of product by personnel [...]|$|R
5|$|German {{scholar and}} folklorist Wilhelm Mannhardt holds that <b>the</b> <b>log</b> {{represented}} an {{incarnation of the}} spirit of vegetation. The sacrifices offered to the badnjak were meant to guarantee the fertility of fields, the health and happiness of the family. Its burning symbolized sunshine, and was intended to secure the vitalizing power of the sun in the ensuing year. The lighting of <b>the</b> <b>log</b> could be regarded as a fusion of tree worship and fire worship, attested in Slavic customs; e.g., Istrians fed the logs lighted on St. John's Day by sprinkling wheat upon them. Čajkanović characterizes the pre-Christian badnjak as a divinity who dies by burning to be reborn, comparing it in this respect with Attis, Osiris, Adonis, and Sandan. He also proposes that the crosses made from the thicker end of <b>the</b> <b>log</b> may have originated from idols representing deities comparable with the Roman Lares, the cruciform having developed from an anthropomorphic shape of the idols. The badnjak is preferably cut from an oak, which was the most respected tree in the old Slavic religion, associated with the supreme god Perun.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial growth follows four phases. When a {{population}} of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the lag phase, a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of growth is <b>the</b> <b>log</b> phase, {{also known as the}} logarithmic or exponential phase. <b>The</b> <b>log</b> phase is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate (k), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time (g). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.|$|E
5|$|Early {{religious}} services {{were held in}} <b>the</b> <b>log</b> church on land deeded to Reformed trustee Jacob Huber and Lutheran trustee John Nicholas Schweitzer, {{both of whom were}} church elders in 1786. The deed conveying the land to the trustees specified that it was to be used for a German church and burial yard. The united congregation became Hebron Church, the first Lutheran church west of the Shenandoah Valley.|$|E
5000|$|Each timber {{firm had}} its own mark which was placed on <b>the</b> <b>logs,</b> called an [...] "end mark". Obliterating or {{altering}} a timber mark was a crime. At <b>the</b> mill <b>the</b> <b>logs</b> were captured by a <b>log</b> boom, and <b>the</b> <b>logs</b> were sorted for ownership before being sawn.|$|R
5000|$|Yamadashi {{literally}} means [...] "coming {{out of the}} mountains". Sixteen fir trees, {{usually about}} 17 to 19 m tall, are selected and cut down in a Shinto ceremony using specially-made axes and adzes. <b>The</b> <b>logs</b> are decorated in red and white regalia, the traditional colors of Shinto ceremonies, and ropes are attached. During Yamadashi, teams of people drag <b>the</b> <b>logs</b> down <b>the</b> mountain towards the shrine. The course of <b>the</b> <b>logs</b> goes over rough terrain, and at certain points <b>the</b> <b>logs</b> must be skidded or dropped down steep slopes. Young men prove their bravery by riding <b>the</b> <b>logs,</b> which can weigh as much as 12 tons, down the hill in a ceremony known as Kiotoshi ("tree falling").|$|R
50|$|Unemployment was not {{an issue}} during this boom period. Almost all of the men were employed, and there was plenty that needed to be done. At the mill men were needed to feed <b>the</b> <b>logs</b> into <b>the</b> mill, to cut and trim <b>the</b> <b>logs,</b> to pile and sort <b>the</b> <b>logs,</b> and of course {{transport}} <b>the</b> <b>logs</b> to <b>the</b> railway. Farmers even found employment for themselves during the winter months. After the harvest they would bring their team of horses to the lumber camps and work all season.|$|R
5|$|Endeavour then resumed her voyage westward {{along the}} coast, picking {{a path through}} {{intermittent}} shoals and reefs {{with the help of}} the pinnace, which was rowed ahead to test the water depth. By 26 August she was out of sight of land, and had entered the open waters of the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, earlier navigated by Luis Váez de Torres in 1606. To keep Endeavours voyages and discoveries secret, Cook confiscated <b>the</b> <b>log</b> books and journals of all on board and ordered them to remain silent about where they had been.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of <b>the</b> <b>Log</b> Revolution {{and the end of}} April 1991, nearly 200 incidents involving the use of explosive devices and 89 attacks on the Croatian police were recorded. The Croatian Ministry of the Interior started arming an increasing number of special police forces, and this led to the building of a real army. On 9 April 1991, Croatian President Tuđman ordered the special police forces to be renamed Zbor Narodne Garde ("National Guard"); this marks the creation of a separate military of Croatia.|$|E
5|$|German {{astronomer}} Johann Bode {{defined the}} constellation Lochium Funis, <b>the</b> <b>Log</b> and Line—a nautical device once used for measuring speed and distance travelled at sea—around Pyxis in his 1801 star atlas, but the depiction did not survive. In 1844 John Herschel attempted to resurrect the classical configuration of Argo Navis by renaming it Malus the Mast, a suggestion followed by Francis Baily, but Benjamin Gould restored Lacaille's nomenclature.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>logs</b> {{were transported}} around 10  km, and scanned using a medical CT scanner (Siemens SOMATOM AR.T).

Boulton compliments Dr. Adams on the timber he is stealing from <b>the</b> <b>logging</b> company; Dr. Adams asserts that <b>the</b> <b>logs</b> are driftwood. Boulton washes a <b>log</b> in <b>the</b> surf, uncovers its mark and tells the doctor it belongs to White and McNally. The doctor becomes uncomfortable, decides not to saw up <b>the</b> <b>logs,</b> but Boulton says {{it makes no difference}} to him who <b>the</b> <b>logs</b> are stolen from. The two men engage in a verbal exchange, and when the doctor threatens Boulton with violence, Boulton mocks him.|$|R
5|$|In 1991, Kijevo was {{a village}} of 1,261 people, 99.6% of whom were Croats. It was {{surrounded}} by the Serb villages of Polača, Civljane and Cetina. Following <b>the</b> <b>Log</b> revolution, the three Serb villages had {{become part of the}} SAO Krajina and road access to Kijevo was restricted as barricades were set up in Polača and Civljane on the roads serving the village. In response, its population set up an ad hoc militia.|$|E

5|$|L'Homme-Rivière is {{a statue}} {{representing}} a log driver at work. The logs are heavily stylized, reduced {{to little more}} than cylinders. The driver and his hook, however, are shown as transforming into a wooden plant. Its location, in a tight space between two tall buildings, gives the sculpture the appearance of travelling down a river gorge. L'Homme-Rivière is highly dynamic, and has been described as looking as though it is about to spill onto the sidewalk. <b>The</b> <b>log</b> driver is a symbolic figure in the history and culture of Quebec, thanks notably to Félix-Antoine Savard's famous novel Menaud, maître draveur.|$|E

5|$|The dugouts {{were created}} by Algonquian peoples who were {{seasonal}} visitors to the area. They built them from the logs of cypress by slowing burning out the center of <b>the</b> <b>log</b> and scraping the burnt wood out, leaving only the outer shell.

There was only one call that night to the police station about the shooting, the prosecution says, and it was made by Bamber at or just before 3:26am. Bamber's defence team argues otherwise. They say that the radio log is not a duplicate log of Bamber's call, but that it shows Nevill also telephoned the police that night.|$|E
