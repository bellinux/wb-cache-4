He despaired of being [...] "a clerk, a machine, a riding-school hack, eating and drinking and sleeping at fixed hours. I should be like everyone else. And that's what they call living, that life at the grindstone, doing the same <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again.... I am hungry and nothing is offered to appease my appetite". He announced his intention to become a writer.|$|E
2500|$|Between them, Homme and Oliveri had {{different}} {{opinions on the}} usage of fake radio excerpts between tracks on the album, the former believing it gave the album [...] "fluidity". According to Oliveri, they are a jibe at [...] "how a lot of stations play the same <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over.</b> We don't get played on the radio, so I figure we should talk shit about them." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{style has}} been noted for its unique instrumentation, {{utilizing}} {{a vast array of}} ethnic instruments, recorded sounds, synthetic textures, and the traditional orchestra, often concurrently. [...] When asked about his inclination for embracing new techniques and constantly shifting his musical palette throughout his career, Goldsmith said, [...] "It seems like it's me, and that's that! [...] Certain composers are doing the same <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again, which I feel is sort of uninteresting. [...] I don't find that you grow very much in that way. [...] I like to keep changing, trying to do new things. [...] Basically, I'm saying the same thing with a little different twist on it. Once you {{get caught up in the}} creative process, something inside takes over, and your subconscious just does it for you." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 2008 interview, Bakshi {{referred}} to Crumb as a [...] "hustler" [...] and stated, [...] "He goes {{in so many}} directions that he's hard to pin down. I spoke {{to him on the}} phone. We both had the same deal, five percent. They finally sent Crumb the money and not me. Crumb always gets what he wants, including that château of his in France.... I have no respect for Crumb. Is he a good artist? Yes, {{if you want to do}} the same <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over.</b> He should have been my best friend for what I did with Fritz the Cat. I drew a good picture, and we both made out fine." [...] Bakshi also stated that Crumb threatened to disassociate himself from any cartoonist that worked with Bakshi, which would have hurt their chances at getting work published.|$|E
2500|$|Oral residue rarely disappears {{quickly and}} never vanishes completely. [...] Speech is {{inherently}} an oral event, based on human relationships, unlike texts. [...] Oral societies can mount strong resistance to literate technologies, as vividly {{shown in the}} arguments of Socrates against writing in Plato’s Phaedrus. [...] Writing, Socrates argues, is inhuman. [...] It attempts to turn living thoughts dwelling in the human mind into mere objects in the physical world. [...] By causing people to rely on what is written rather than what {{they are able to}} think, it weakens the powers of the mind and of memory. [...] True knowledge can only emerge from a relationship between active human minds. [...] And unlike a person, a text can’t respond to a question; it will just keep saying the same <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again, no matter how often it is refuted.|$|E
2500|$|... "Even Flow" [...] {{features}} lyrics {{written by}} vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard. Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "I {{know it was}} a great song all along, and I felt that it was the best song that we got the worst take of on the first record. There were a hundred takes on that song, and we just never nailed it." [...] Drummer Dave Krusen said, [...] "I was pretty green back then and 'Even Flow' suffered from too much fluctuation." [...] He added that [...] "it was really tough for me. I don't know why. Not sure why we didn't use that one from the demo as well, but I know it felt better." [...] Guitarist Mike McCready stated, [...] "We did 'Even Flow' about 50, 70 times. I swear to God it was a nightmare. We played that <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> until we hated each other. I still don't think Stone is satisfied with how it came out." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band plays music more {{oriented}} towards '70s guitar-driven {{rock bands}} because, as Wood stated, [...] "etal just becomes the same <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over.</b> Anyway, I'm {{not really a}} metal dude. None of us are. I'm sure if you studied pictures of 3 Inches of Blood you could pick us out as not really belonging there". Sunny and Bobby were replaced by Justin Hagberg, who had previously played with Pipes in Allfather, a black metal band, and Shane Clark. Roadrunner put out an advertising blitz, and the track [...] "Deadly Sinners" [...] from the band's second release Advance and Vanquish appeared on numerous sampler CDs, compilations, and even three video games (Tony Hawk's Underground 2, Saints Row 2, and Brütal Legend), creating a huge press hype for the band that caused their popularity to skyrocket, with a slot on 2005's Road Rage tour in August (with bands like Machine Head and Chimaira) gaining them many new fans.|$|E

5000|$|Regarding {{the press}} conference of the comet’s discovery, Hale praised the {{reporting}} done by the “the very first reporter that broke {{the story of the}} comet’s discovery,” the Albuquerque Journal’s science reporter John Fleck: John spoiled me. The rest of the media... were mostly not like him. I would go round <b>and</b> round the same <b>things</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again <b>and</b> they would still get it wrong.|$|R
60|$|The {{examination}} {{in military}} matters came {{off on the}} afternoon of the following Wednesday and on Thursday morning.

60|$|Tessa gave {{a slight}} start at Romola's new tone of inquiry, {{and looked up}} at her with a hesitating expression.

5000|$|The {{extent to}} which the US {{government}} used propaganda aimed at its own people is a matter of discussion. The book Selling Intervention & War, by Jon Western, argued that president Bush was [...] "selling the war" [...] to the public. In a 2005 talk to students Bush said: [...] "See, in my line of work, you got to keep repeating <b>things</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again, for the truth to sink in, to kind of catapult the propaganda." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "MY DEAR CARLYLE,--I {{have been}} writing a good many letters all in a batch, to go by the same opportunity; and I am {{thoroughly}} weary of writing the same <b>things</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again to different people. My letter to you therefore, I fear, must have much {{of the character of}} remainder-biscuit.

60|$|Chatterer {{kept saying}} these two <b>things</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again to himself. You see, {{he really was}} afraid, {{and he was trying}} to make himself believe that he wasn't afraid. He thought that perhaps if he said ever and ever so many times that he wasn't afraid, he might {{actually}} make himself believe it. The trouble was that every time he said it, a little voice, a little, truthful voice down inside, seemed to speak right up and tell him that he was afraid.|$|R
6000|$|But the Catherine Wheel {{shook her}} head. [...] "Romance is dead, Romance is dead, Romance is dead," [...] she murmured. She {{was one of}} those people who think that, if you say the same <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> a great many times, it becomes true in the end.|$|E

60|$|At {{this the}} crabs began {{performing}} their antics again, {{but they did}} the same <b>things</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over,</b> so Cap'n Bill <b>and</b> Trot soon tired, as Merla said they would, and decided they had seen enough of the crab circus. So they proceeded to swim farther up the rocky canyon, and near its upper end {{they came to a}} lot of conch shells lying upon the sandy bottom.

5000|$|Another song on {{the album}} gave Mathis the {{opportunity}} to provide some insight into his emphasis upon including as many verses as he does: [...] "I loved singing songs {{that were part of}} that great songbook that was recorded at the time by Ella Fitzgerald and eventually Sarah Vaughan.
