5|$|Almost {{the entire}} {{original}} cast from season two returned {{for the third}} season, including Amy Poehler, Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari, Nick Offerman, Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt. The only permanent cast member not to return was Paul Schneider, who previously played city planner Mark Brendanawicz. Schneider departed from the series {{at the end of}} season two. Jim O'Heir and Retta, who made regular appearances as parks employees Jerry Gergich and Donna Meagle during the first two seasons, were considered members of the regular cast starting in season three, although <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> not appear in the opening credits. Adam Scott, who portrayed state auditor Ben Wyatt in the final two episodes of the second season, became a regular cast member starting in season three, and Rob Lowe, who appeared in the same two second-season episodes as state auditor Chris Traeger, also joined the cast in season three. Lowe was originally meant only to make a string of performances in seasons two and three and then depart the show, but he instead become a regular cast member starting with the third season, having signed a multi-year contract to remain on the show. After actor Charlie Sheen was fired from the CBS comedy series Two and a Half Men in March 2011, rumors circulated that Rob Lowe would depart Parks and Recreation and replace Sheen, but they proved unfounded.|$|E
25|$|Cavalcades {{are similar}} to {{standard}} treks, but are conducted on horseback. The packing restrictions are even more intense than a regular trek as participants are only allowed one standard sleeping bag stuff sacks to pack everything into, including their sleeping bags. The participants focus more on horse care than on other programs at the camp, though <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> take part in many other activities. Calvalcades last only 7 days total, with 2 days being in base camp.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the streets}} of most of Manhattan above Houston Street, streets in the Village {{typically}} are named rather than numbered. While some of the formerly named streets (including Factory, Herring and Amity Streets) are now numbered, <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> not always conform to the usual grid pattern when they enter the neighborhood. For example, West 4th Street runs east-west across most of Manhattan, but runs north-south in Greenwich Village, causing it to intersect with West 10th, 11th, and 12th Streets before ending at West 13th Street.|$|E

25|$|The Library's famous Rose Main Reading Room (Room 315) is {{a majestic}} , with -high ceilings. The room {{is lined with}} {{thousands}} of reference works on open shelves along the floor level and along the balcony, lit by massive windows and grand chandeliers, and furnished with sturdy wood tables, comfortable chairs, and brass lamps. It is also equipped with computers providing access to library collections and the Internet as well as docking facilities for laptops. Readers study books brought to them from the library's closed stacks. There are special rooms named for notable authors and scholars, {{many of whom have}} done important research and writing at the Library. But the Library has always been about more than scholars; during the Great Depression, many members of the general public, out of work, used the Library to improve their lot in life, as <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
25|$|After Noah's {{decision}} to {{enlist in the}} army is derailed by the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy, which he defies, the couple resume living together at the Snyder farm, although <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> not share a bed. Soon thereafter, Luke starts the Luke Snyder Foundation for sick children with money inherited from his birth father's family, and the attorney they hire, Brian, begins throwing road blocks between them, cautioning Luke that being openly gay will hurt his foundation with conservative investors. Ultimately, however, it is Luke himself who causes the couple to break up, when he finds himself pitched in a dirty political campaign against his first love, Kevin. To counter the homophobic attacks of Kevin's supporters, Luke winds up permitting Casey Hughes to stuff the ballot box to ensure that he will win. Noah cannot take part in this dishonesty and refuses to lie for Luke when they are challenged. Feeling also that Luke has unresolved issues about Kevin, he moves out and distances himself.|$|E
25|$|One {{possible}} scenario on how direct insemination {{evolved in}} insects {{is seen in}} scorpions. The male deposits a spermatophore on the ground, locks its claws with the female's claws and then guides her over his packet of sperm, making sure it comes in contact with her genital opening. When the early (male) insects laid their spermatophores on the ground, {{it seems likely that}} some of them used the clasping organs {{at the end of their}} body to drag the female over the package. The ancestors of Odonata evolved the habit of grabbing the female behind her head, as <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> today. This action, rather than not grasping the female at all, would have increased the male's chances of spreading its genes. The chances would be further increased if they first attached their spermatophore safely on their own abdomen before they placed their abdominal claspers behind the female's head; the male would then not let the female go before her abdomen had made direct contact with his sperm storage, allowing the transfer of all sperm.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} of the room has other signs of wealth; the brass chandelier is large and elaborate by contemporary standards, {{and would have been}} very expensive. It would probably have had a mechanism with pulley and chains above, to lower it for managing the candles (possibly omitted from the painting for lack of room). The convex mirror at the back, in a wooden frame with scenes of The Passion painted behind glass, is shown larger than such mirrors could actually be made at this date – another discreet departure from realism by van Eyck. There is also no sign of a fireplace (including in the mirror), nor anywhere obvious to put one. Even the oranges casually placed to the left are a sign of wealth; they were very expensive in Burgundy, and may {{have been one of the}} items dealt in by Arnolfini. Further signs of luxury are the elaborate bed-hangings and the carvings on the chair and bench against the back wall (to the right, partly hidden by the bed), also the small Oriental carpet on the floor by the bed; many owners of such expensive objects placed them on tables, as <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> in the Netherlands.|$|E
500|$|By {{the release}} of their 1995 studio album Dahlia, the band toned its stage {{appearance}} down, cutting their hair and wearing more rock-inspired outfits. In a 2010 interview, Yoshiki stated that the abandoning of stronger make-up and outrageous outfits was a natural progression in their style, however, <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> use make-up on stage, [...] "sometimes heavy, sometimes less" [...] and that he still considers the band visual kei.|$|E

The virus was found on a sample taken 10 miles below the earth, and may be 75,000 years old and responsible for wiping out the Ice Age mammals. As a bio-hazard team enters the building to test people for the virus, a CDC official orders the army {{to prepare for a}} [...] "level six eradication", because <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> not know how to contain it.|$|E

50|$|The {{first thing}} he wrote down was the {{procedure}} that Jesus used to make apostles, priests, and teachers.

500|$|Like the islands, {{the ridges}} {{surrounding}} the city, including the cliffs in the foreground, look {{very much as}} <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>do.</b> South (right) {{of the city is}} the island of Södermalm, where a cluster of buildings (see image of the southern city gate above) lined up along the shore called Tranbodarna were used to burn train oil (e.g. seal lard). [...] The round building on the eastern end of Södermalm was the gallows hill. [...] As depicted in the painting, it was used exclusively for men (women were beheaded). [...] The gallows remained there until the late 17th century when they were moved to present-day Hammarbyhöjden south of the historical city centre.|$|E
500|$|Two {{years of}} {{kindergarten}} were offered, beginning at age four, and students progressed through to first grade {{with other students}} their age. The Cottage School was free to all students, and was supported both by Coonley's own resources and funds raised by the Kindergarten Education Association. The Association, of which Coonley was president, promoted new educational ideas and raised money to help support them. In 1915, John Dewey and his daughter Evelyn featured the Cottage School in their book, The Schools of To-Morrow, which examined how progressive {{schools around the country}} put new educational ideas into action. They were especially struck by how prominently nature featured in school life, noting that they have, for example, a rare bird that is as much a personality in school life as any of the children, and the children, having cared for him and watched his growth and habits, have become much more interested in wild birds. In the backyard is a goat, the best liked thing on the place, where the children have raised him from a little kid; and <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> all the work of caring for him. The Deweys held the Cottage School as an example of training in good citizenship, commenting on its mock elections, self-government, and public service: [...] "The school organized by the pupils into a civic league has made itself responsible for the conditions of the streets in certain portions of town, and is not only cleaning up but trying to get the rest of the town interested in the problem." [...] The teaching of English was also noted, as it was not taught as a separate subject but as part of history lessons, journal-keeping, and other exercises. Dewey wrote, [...] "The emphasis is put on helping the child to express his ideas; but such work provides ample opportunity for the required drill in the mechanics of writing." ...|$|E

In the United States, only 5% of the population {{did not have a}} belief in a god and out of that small group only 24% self-identified as [...] "atheist", while 15% self-identified as [...] "agnostic" [...] and 35% self-identified as [...] "nothing in particular".|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Johanan {{asked whether}} God's words in [...] "For I have {{hardened}} his heart," [...] {{did not provide}} heretics with ground for arguing that Pharaoh had no means of repenting. Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish (Resh Lakish) replied that the mouths of the heretics should be stopped up. For, as [...] teaches, [...] "If it concerns the scorners, He scorns them." [...] When God warns people once, twice, and even a third time, and <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> not repent, then God closes their hearts against repentance so that God may exact vengeance from them for their sins. Thus {{it was with the}} wicked Pharaoh. Since God sent five times to him (in the first five plagues) and he took no notice, God then told Pharaoh that he had stiffened his neck and hardened his heart, so God would add to Pharaoh's impurity. The Midrash taught that the expression [...] "I hardened" [...] ( [...] , hichbad'ti) implied that God made Pharaoh's heart like a liver ( [...] , kaveid), which stiffens (and becomes unabsorbent) if boiled a second time. So Pharaoh's heart was made like a liver, and he did not receive the words of God.|$|E
