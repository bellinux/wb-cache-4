5|$|The U.S. Weather Bureau {{office was}} moved to 2nd floor of the {{original}} Boise Air <b>Terminal</b> <b>Building</b> at Gowen Field on December 19, 1939. All operations at the U.S. Federal building and the old Boise Airport were transferred to the new office by February 20, 1940. In addition to the surface weather observations of temperature, precipitation and wind, Radiosonde observations which began September 1, 1939 at the downtown airport, were moved to a small building north of the Boise <b>terminal</b> <b>building</b> at Gowen Field in 1940. A new balloon inflation building was built east of the terminal in October 1954 with a dome on top to hold the signal receiving equipment. The building {{was moved to}} the NIFC campus in August 1969 where it is still being used today. The temperatures and precipitation were taken near the airport <b>terminal</b> <b>building</b> through 1969 though they were moved periodically to accommodate the growing airport. The wind instrument was moved several times through 1969 {{from the top of the}} United Hanger to the top of the <b>terminal</b> <b>building</b> to field northwest of the runway.

5|$|In {{addition}} to {{problems with the}} <b>terminal</b> <b>building,</b> both the airport's location and surrounding infrastructure were {{the subject of much}} complaint as well. For one, although some 1,700 cars visited the airport daily, the parking lot had only 129 slots, and could not be expanded any further. The airport complex likewise was located directly alongside major city thoroughfares, in particular the city's main highway, the Tomas Confesor Highway, which complicated the flow of traffic in and around the area. At one point, the ATO, which was already having difficulty managing vehicular traffic around the airport, proposed banning cargo and delivery trucks from passing through the road in front of the <b>terminal</b> <b>building.</b> However, the city government did not respond.|$|E

In {{the early stages of the}} air raid the rolling stock stored in the Necropolis siding was burned, and the railway arch connecting the main line to the Necropolis terminus was damaged, although the <b>terminal</b> <b>building</b> itself remained unscathed.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{the company}} {{experienced}} a 40% passenger growth, and from 6 September, Air Norway also introduced services on Wednesday. The same year, the municipality started a NOK1.8 million upgrade to the airport. When it opened on 3 September 2007, {{it became an}} international airport and allowed transit for passengers to Aalborg, plus increased security and a general renovation of the <b>terminal</b> <b>building</b> from 1978.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, Sheriff Porttens deputized {{two hundred}} men and they {{marched to the}} <b>terminal</b> <b>building</b> where they {{attempted}} to assist the strikebreakers in moving the streetcars from the street and vulnerable <b>terminal</b> <b>building</b> to the more easily protected carhouse across the street. Todd led the strikebeakers in the effort while the police provided protection. The police were able {{to hold back the}} crowd at first, using clubs to hit anyone who attempted to interfere. The rioters increased the intensity of their attack, and men on the rooftops began throwing stones and bricks. Todd was hit multiple times and {{was rushed to the hospital}} with severe injuries. The greatly outnumbered police began to abandon their posts and the strikebreakers fled into the storage buildings. People in the crowd opened fire on a storage building and killed one of the strikebreakers and injured others. By the end of November 3, after two days of protecting the cars, less than fifty policemen remained on duty in the city. Meanwhile, the strike degenerated into a riot encompassing the entire downtown.|$|E
