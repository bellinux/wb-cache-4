5|$|In November 2004, {{at the age}} of 26, Soyer severed his {{spinal cord}} during an {{accident}} while riding his motorbike on his parents' farm. He was keen to exercise as soon as he could during his rehabilitation. He tried several sports, including wheelchair tennis, wheelchair rugby and wheelchair basketball, following his accident in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>one</b> that made him feel able-bodied. He drove dune buggies and tried kayaking, and in 2007 was learning how to para-glide.|$|E
5|$|Nuttin {{analyzed}} {{the data to}} see if there was a national-letter effect, but failed <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>one.</b> Norwegians did not favor the letter N (for Norge) more than people from other countries did, neither did the Hungarians favor the letter M (for Magyarország). This led Nuttin to conclude that individual ownership has affective consequences that are not observed for collective ownership.|$|E

5|$|Police {{had found}} and arrested some {{suspects}} within 24 {{hours of the}} crime. From recordings made by a highway CCTV vehicle, {{a description of the}} bus, a white charter bus with a name written on it, was broadcast. Other operators identified it as being contracted by a South Delhi private school. They then traced it and found its driver, Ram Singh. Police obtained sketches of the assailants {{with the help of the}} male victim, and used a cell phone stolen from the two victims <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>one</b> of the assailants.|$|E
5|$|The episode's {{title is}} derived from the 1965 Milton Bradley board game for teenage girls, Mystery Date, wherein several female players draw cards to advance to opening a door, hoping <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>one</b> of a variety of {{desirable}} male dates on the other side, while simultaneously hoping to avoid the lone undesirable one. A vintage television commercial for the game is viewed by Don's daughter Sally during the episode.|$|E
5|$|Emerging {{technologies}} such as X-rays gave physicians new diagnostic tools, revealing the intervertebral disc {{as a source for}} back pain in some cases. In 1938, orthopedic surgeon Joseph S. Barr reported on cases of disc-related sciatica improved or cured with back surgery. As a result of this work, in the 1940s, the vertebral disc model of low back pain took over, dominating the literature through the 1980s, aiding further by the rise of new imaging {{technologies such}} as CT and MRI. The discussion subsided as research showed disc problems to be a relatively uncommon cause of the pain. Since then, physicians have come to realize that it is unlikely that a specific cause for low back pain can be identified in many cases and question the need <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>one</b> at all as most of the time symptoms resolve within 6 to 12 weeks regardless of treatment.|$|E

5|$|Having finally eluded his pursuers, Bompart made {{directly}} for Lough Swilly where the landing {{was scheduled to}} take place. Unaware of the rebellion's defeat, he hoped that Humbert's army would be operating in the Lough Swilly area, as intended in the campaign planned before Humbert left France. Arriving off the coast, Bompart searched for a suitable landing site but was unable <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>one</b> before dark on 10 October. He waited out the night close to Tory Island, but was surprised the next day by sails on the horizon; Warren's squadron had been joined by Countess's ships, and an overwhelming force was bearing down on the French. Abandoning all notions of landing the troops, Bompart hauled his ships close to the wind to give them room to manoeuvre and allow their captains as much opportunity as possible to escape the approaching British.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} {{to rebuild the}} Dixon may have been motivated by a trip that Capt. James W. “Jim” Shaver made to Puget Sound to investigate purchasing a steamboat, but was unable <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>one</b> suitable for operation on the Willamette and Columbia rivers.|$|E
25|$|Six blind {{elephants}} {{were discussing}} what men were like. After arguing they decided <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>one</b> and determine {{what it was}} like by direct experience.

25|$|In 1971 it was {{described}} {{that it was}} very difficult to find a CR cell in the adult cortex, because of the constant number of these cells and the fact that as the brain grows, the distance between these cells increases, required the observation of a great number of preparations <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>one</b> of these cells.|$|E

50|$|The idea {{of using}} pebbles <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>one's</b> way back is a {{reference}} to Hansel and Gretel or the French fairy tale Hop o' My Thumb. However a 'helpful' Roman Soldier picks up the pebbles for the Roman Official, trapping him in the maze also.|$|R
50|$|The ability <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>one's</b> {{way around}} during a dive can be {{critical}} to survival. Navigation skills and techniques appropriate to the environment must be mastered. The dive plan must be understood and followed, and contingency plans should be available for the foreseeable deviations from the plan.|$|R
25|$|The {{modified}} Thompson Tau test is used <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>one</b> outlier {{at a time}} (largest {{value of}} δ is removed if it is an outlier). Meaning, if a data point {{is found to be}} an outlier, it is removed from the data set and the test is applied again with a new average and rejection region. This process is continued until no outliers remain in a data set.|$|E
25|$|The {{residency}} {{status in}} the host country whilst under temporary UNHCR protection is very uncertain as refugees are only granted temporary visas {{that have to be}} regularly renewed. Rather than only safeguarding the rights and basic well-being of refugees in the camps or in urban settings on a temporary basis the UNHCR's ultimate goal is <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>one</b> of the three durable solutions for refugees: integration, repatriation, resettlement.|$|E
25|$|A white chevron appears {{between the}} eyes, and two large white spots grace each cheek. Another white chevron occurs where the neck meets the chest. The large ears are to sharpen hearing, and the {{distinctive}} coloration may help bongos identify {{one another in}} their dark forest habitats. Bongos have no special secretion glands, so rely less on scent <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>one</b> another than do other similar antelopes. The lips of a bongo are white, topped with a black muzzle.|$|E

This was however a small matter. <b>To</b> <b>find</b> <b>one's</b> way by asking it is not difficult, even in London, if one possesses average intelligence.|$|R
50|$|By 1970, Salmon {{had found}} that when seeking to explain {{probabilistic}} phenomena, we seek not merely high probability, but screen for causal influence by removing components of a system <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>ones</b> that alter the probability. Salmon sought to replace Hempel's IS model with Salmon's statistical-relevance model (SR model).|$|R

25|$|Since {{there is}} a {{one-to-one}} correspondence between cumulative distribution functions and characteristic functions, it is always possible <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>one</b> of these functions if we know the other one. The formula in definition of characteristic function allows us to compute φ when we know the distribution function F (or density f). If, on the other hand, we know the characteristic function φ and want to find the corresponding distribution function, {{then one of the}} following inversion theorems can be used.|$|E
25|$|Chessman was {{the last}} UWA Light Heavyweight {{champion}} having defeated El Zorro in April, 2007. in 2007 Chessman competed in the tournament to crown the first ever AAA Mega Champion and put his title {{on the line in}} the tournament. In the finals he lost to El Mesias by disqualification, while the title does not change hands on a disqualification the UWA World Light Heavyweight Championship was eliminated as the purpose of the tournament was <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>one</b> top champion and clear up the muddled championship picture in AAA.|$|E
25|$|Having {{failed in}} {{her efforts to}} {{convince}} the English she is a holy virgin, and that killing her will invoke the wrath of heaven, she alters her story and claims she is pregnant, hoping they will spare her {{for the sake of}} the child. She then lists off various French nobles who could be her child's father in an effort <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>one</b> who the English respect. In this sense then, Joan leaves the play as neither saintly nor demonic, but as a frightened woman pleading fruitlessly for her life.|$|E
