50|$|A {{film leader}} is {{a length of}} film {{attached}} to the head or tail of a film to assist in threading a projector or telecine. Leader attached {{to the beginning of}} a reel is sometimes known as a head leader, or simply head, and leader attached {{to the end of a}} reel known as a <b>tail</b> <b>leader</b> or foot leader, or simply tail or foot.|$|E
50|$|The first cue appears {{twelve feet}} (3.7 m) {{before the end}} of the program on the reel, {{equivalent}} to eight seconds at 24 frames/sec. This cue signals the projectionist to start the motor of the projector containing the next reel. After another ten and a half feet (3.2 m) of film is shown (seven seconds at 24 frames/sec), the changeover cue should appear, which signals the projectionist to actually make the changeover. When this second cue appears, the projectionist has one and a half feet (457 mm), or one second at 24 frame/s, to make the changeover. If it doesn't occur within one second, the <b>tail</b> <b>leader</b> of the reel coming to an end will be projected on the screen.|$|E
5000|$|The Jesuit {{presence}} {{in this area}} {{goes back to the}} 1840s when Fr. Peter DeSmet, S.J., was welcomed by the plains Indians and had contacts with the Lakota. Based on his reputation as a man who could be trusted, and on the Jesuit reputation as educators, in 1877 Chief Sinte Gleska (Spotted <b>Tail),</b> <b>leader</b> of the Sicangu Lakota, and Chief Red Cloud, leader of the Oglala, obtained permission from President Rutherford B. Hayes [...] "to get Catholic priests. Those who wear black dresses. These men will teach us how to read and write English.” This led to the arrival of a Jesuit Father and brother soon after 1881 and, with financial help from St. Katherine Drexel, the completion of a large building in 1886. In 1888 Franciscan Sisters Kostka, Rosalia, and Alcantara came to teach in the school which they named after St. Francis. Jesuit Fr. Florentine Digmann who had come with the sisters went on to establish 37 mission stations on the Rosebud Reservation. Since 1974 the school, locally called Sapa Un Ti (“where the Black Robes live”), has been run by the tribe, independently from the Jesuit mission. The many chapels have been replaced by six parishes on the reservation.|$|E

For example, very specific types {{are used in}} negative cutting while making A and B rolls for printing. [...] "Painted leader" [...] is perforated film in overall colors, usually white, black, red, blue, or green. These are used for protective head and <b>tail</b> <b>leaders</b> to keep {{the body of the}} program material from being damaged. [...] "Fill leader" [...] (also called picture fill, or spacer, or slug film) is used to space out different sections of magnetic audio film stock so they are kept in synchronization with the picture. Typically, this is made from rejected or retired prints of previously released programs.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Khusniati, Asna. Registered Number. 2813123045. The Effectiveness of Chinese Whispers Game Toward Students’ Vocabulary Mastery of Seventh Grade at SMPN 2 Sumbergempol Tulungagung. Thesis. English Education Department. State Islamic Institute (IAIN) of Tulungagung. Advisor: Nany Soengkono Madayani, SS, M. Pd. Keywords :Chinese Whispers Game, Vocabulary. 		Vocabulary {{is one of}} the {{components}} that need to be mastered when students are learning English, because it will influence other skills in language. Students sometimes confuse and not interest the explanation from teacher, moreover when they teach by conventional method. This situation usually makes students be bored to study. One way to make students enthusiasm to learn is good method from teacher. One of the games used in teaching English vocabulary is Chinese Whispers game. Chinese Whispers game is game that played by groups include 8 - 9 participants. Each group stands and makes row with their group. Every group has leader and <b>tail.</b> <b>Leader</b> group gets a sentence whisper from teacher with showing the picture that related to the vocabulary as the clue. Leader group whispers what she/he heard by showing the picture clue same with the teacher rules to the second row, the second row whispers what she/he heard by showing the picture clue to the third row and etc. Tail group writes what she/he heard in the piece of paper, then adhere piece of paper and picture clue in the whiteboard. The students know the fault in discussion section, then write the vocabulary in their book. 		The formulation of the research problems were (1) How is the students’ vocabulary mastery before being taught by using Chinese Whispers Game? (2) How is the students’ vocabulary mastery after being taught by using Chinese Whispers Game? (3) Is there any significant difference score of students’ vocabulary by using Chinese Whispers Game? 		 The purposes of this research were (1) To know the students’ vocabulary mastery before being taught by using “Chinese Whispers Game”. (2) To know the students’ vocabulary mastery after being taught by using “Chinese Whispers Game”. (3) To know whether there is significance difference in students’ vocabulary mastery before and after taught by using “Chinese Whispers Game”. The research design of this research was pre-experimental design with one group pretest and posttest with quantitative approach. The population of this research was all the students of seventh grade at SMPN 2 Sumbergempol. The sample that used in this research was the students of VIIB class of SMPN 2 Sumbergempol that includes 26 students. Instrument of this research was test in the form of vocabulary test. The data analyzed was used t-test formula. The result showed that the mean of student’s score before used Chinese Whispers game was 73, 07. While the mean of student’s score after used Chinese Whispers game was 91, 23. The result of t-test score was 9, 078 and t-table with significant difference 5...|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} webinars, host Brad Lang, the CAF Red <b>Tail</b> Squadron <b>Leader,</b> {{described}} the interaction as important to reconciling the historical record with the Red Tails film's essentially dramatic retelling of the Tuskegee Airmen saga. Both colonels also agreed that the discussions were important to resolving {{the controversy over the}} film.|$|R
40|$|The {{role of the}} {{membrane}} electrochemical potential in the translocation of acidic and basic residues across {{the membrane}} was investigated with the M 13 procoat protein, which has a short periplasmic loop, and leader peptidase, which has an extended periplasmically located N-terminal tail. For both proteins {{we find that the}} membrane potential promotes membrane transfer only when negatively charged residues are present within the translocated domain. When these residues are substituted by uncharged amino acids, the proteins insert into the membrane independently of the potential. In contrast, when a positively charged residue is present within the N-terminal <b>tail</b> of <b>leader</b> peptidase, the potential impedes translocation of the tail domain. However, an impediment was not observed {{in the case of the}} procoat protein, where positively charged residues in the central loop are translocated even in the presence of the membrane potential. Intriguingly, several of the negatively charged procoat proteins required the SecA and SecY proteins for optimal translocation. The studies reported here provide insights into the role of the potential in membrane protein assembly and suggest that electrophoresis can play an important role in controlling membrane topology...|$|R
50|$|The {{season began}} with {{consecutive}} defeats {{in the league}} and League Cup to Bury and Swansea City respectively, before an unbeaten run of 12 league matches put Brentford in the automatic promotion places, with midfielder Glenn Poole continuing his good form from the previous season by scoring seven goals during the run. Two defeats in a row dropped the Bees to 9th in early November, before another unbeaten run put the club back in the automatic promotion places by 20 December. Brentford moved into second position after a 2-0 victory over Bournemouth on Boxing Day and consistently good results kept the club on the <b>tail</b> of <b>leaders</b> Wycombe Wanderers through January and early February 2009. A 1-1 draw with Accrington Stanley on 10 February moved the Bees moved into top spot and consistently good results, aided by the goalscoring of January loan acquisition Jordan Rhodes, kept the club at the summit into mid-March. Brentford and Wycombe Wanderers faced off at Griffin Park on 14 March in front of a season-high crowd of 10,642 and the match yielded a 3-3 draw, with Aston Villa loanee Sam Williams drilling home late in proceedings to salvage a point for the Bees. Three days later, Brentford suffered a first defeat for six weeks after a home defeat to Chesterfield, but remained top of the table.|$|R
50|$|Button and Webber pitted, Webber got {{out ahead}} of Button and they both got {{out ahead of}} Fernando Alonso. Räikkönen, finally with a clear track ahead, set a series of fastest laps, the best being a 1:31.540, and then pitted. By then he was only 5 seconds behind Fisichella and was closing on the Renault. Meanwhile, Alonso had got past Button who was {{slipping}} back to Coulthard and Michael Schumacher. Alonso then passed Webber for third. Up the road, Räikkönen was now right on the <b>tail</b> of race <b>leader</b> Fisichella. With 3 laps to go, Fisichella went defensive under braking at the Casio Triangle, which allowed Räikkönen to get a tow on the pit straight. Fisichella defended but the story repeated next lap, and this time Räikkönen {{was able to get}} past around the outside of turn 1 of the final lap.|$|R
500|$|After training, in August 1940, he {{was briefly}} posted to No. 19 Squadron as a {{probationary}} pilot officer. Due to equipment difficulties, 19 Squadron {{were unable to}} complete Johnson's training and he left the unit. On 6 September 1940 Johnson was posted to No. 616 Squadron at RAF Coltishall. Squadron Leader H.L [...] "Billy" [...] Burton took Johnson on a 50-minute training flight in X4055. After the flight Burton impressed upon Johnson the difficulties of deflection shooting and the technique of a killing shot from line-astern or near line-astern positions; {{the duty of the}} number two whose job was not to shoot down enemy aircraft but to ensure the <b>leader's</b> <b>tail</b> was safe. Burton also directed Johnson to some critical tactical essentials; the importance of keeping good battle formation and the tactical use of sun, cloud and height. Five days later, Johnson flew an X-Raid patrol in Spitfire X4330, qualifying for the Battle of Britain clasp.|$|R
50|$|In mid-June III./JG 52 {{returned}} to Bucharest to re-equip onto the Bf 109F {{just in time}} for Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Russia. But again, tasked with protecting the oilfields, and being the southernmost Gruppen on the front, it had very little to do except to intercept bombers raiding the Romanian ports. So it was only once the Gruppen transferred to the Ukraine that Graf and Steinbatz were able to open their accounts - both shooting down I-16 fighters on the 4 August while escorting a Ju 87 formation. But it could have all been so different: Graf had dived in behind an enemy fighter and was set to fire, then nothing! Only then, he realised that he had forgotten to prime his guns. Then from out of nowhere another fighter fell in on his tail. Graf expected to be shot down, then the Soviet fighter itself suddenly burst into flames and fell out of the sky. Steinbatz, like every good wingman had been hanging back and carefully covering his <b>leader's</b> <b>tail.</b> Correcting his mistake, Graf got his first victory soon afterward.|$|R
50|$|Durham Edition {{had been}} {{prepared}} by trainer Arthur Stephenson specifically with the Grand National in mind after his second-place finish the previous year. A proven ability {{to be at the}} business end of the National ensured plenty of public support to be sent off at 15/2. In addition, he was to be partnered, as last year, by Chris Grant, jointly the most experienced rider in the race, weighing out for his ninth National. The pair ran what was considered at the time by many in racing to be a textbook Grand National: hunting around the first circuit in mid-division before gradually moving through the field on the second; always in touch, they moved into the rear of a leading group of seven at the Canal Turn on the second circuit, tracking the group until moving up onto the <b>tail</b> of the <b>leader</b> over the final two fences. When asked to quicken however, Grant found his mount to be a spent force and instead of closing on the leader he was swallowed up by other stronger finishers, coming home in fifth place. The pair would return in 1990 for a third attempt at the race together.|$|R
5000|$|One {{tactical}} innovation {{adopted by}} 2nd TAF Spitfires was the [...] "Fluid Six"' formation, {{which had been}} developed through combat experience in Europe and North Africa. The first use of the tactic dated back to at least November 1941. It is known that No. 112 Squadron RAF used this in the North African campaign. This formation [...] "was considered the best fighter formation of the war". It abandoned the leader-wingman combination that had existed before. Instead, {{it was based on}} three pairs of Spitfires which could provide mutual cover and support: the pairs were 'stacked' in altitude so that the pair (e.g.: 5 & 6) flying up-sun, and covering the <b>tails</b> of the <b>leaders</b> (1 & 2), flew higher, while the other pair (e.g.: 3 & 4) flew lower. Any attacking aircraft could be sandwiched between two pairs of Spitfires, no matter the direction or altitude of the attack. Another advantage of this formation was that when operating at squadron strength a flight commander was able to lead six aircraft of his own flight, [...] "whereas, with formations of four there would more likely be one formation from each flight with the third consisting of aircraft from another flight." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{beginning}} of July saw more German air {{activity in the}} sector. Eight aircraft left Toul about 16:30 in two echelons of four each. About 17:30 the low flight saw five German Pfalz D.III scout planes crossing the line at Château-Thierry. It was engaged in combat and Lt O'Neill drove one down out of control. Both of his guns then jammed and {{he was forced to}} withdraw, with two enemy aircraft on his tail. Lt. Raible engaged another but both of his guns jammed. Lt. Siemonds motor gave trouble and was also force to withdraw and make an emergency landing while Lt Perry attacked and downed the one he engaged. Meanwhile, high flight was in aerial combat with seven more Pfalz. Lt. Porter got on the <b>tail</b> of the <b>leader</b> and shot him down. Three other enemy aircraft were shot down by other members of the flight. It was the first significant combat for the 147th Squadron and it had met the enemy, eight to twelve and brought down half his formation. For the next few days, there were no enemy engagements of substance to report. It was on 8 July the first member of the squadron was lost in action. Lt. Maxwell O. Perry was lost when ten of the 147th flew well into enemy territory chasing their aircraft and he failed to return.|$|R
5000|$|Mowgli the feral {{child is}} about 16 {{years old and}} living contentedly with his wolves in the Seeonee jungle, when the peace is {{disturbed}} by 'Won-tolla', a solitary wolf whose mate and cubs {{have been killed by}} dholes, who warns the Seeonee wolves that the dhole-pack will soon overrun their territory. Later that night, Mowgli meets Kaa, the huge old python, and tells him the news. Kaa does not believe that Mowgli and the pack will survive a direct attack by the dholes, and enters a trance to search his century-long memory for an effective strategy. When he awakens, Kaa takes Mowgli to the Bee Rocks: a gorge where huge hives produced by millions of wild bees overhang the river, and Mowgli and Kaa devise a plan to lure the dholes to the gorge so that the bees will attack them. Mowgli therefore lies in wait for the dholes in a tree-branch and smears himself with garlic to repel the bees. When the dholes arrive he taunts their leader into a furious rage and cuts off the <b>leader's</b> <b>tail,</b> before fleeing to the gorge. Just before leaping into the water Mowgli kicks piles of stones into the beehives, to arouse the bees. The garlic prevents the bees from attacking Mowgli, and he dives safely into the river where Kaa swiftly coils around his body to prevent the current from sweeping him away. Some of the dholes are stung to death by the enraged bees, while others drown in the torrent. The rest flee downstream, pursued by Mowgli. Eventually Mowgli and the surviving dholes reach shallower water, where Mowgli and the wolves fight a ferocious and bloody battle with the remaining dholes, and Won-tolla kills the dhole leader before dying of his own wounds. As the battle comes to its end, Mowgli finds Akela, mortally wounded, who tells Mowgli that he must soon return to the human race. When Mowgli asks who will drive him there, Akela replies: [...] "Mowgli will drive Mowgli. Go back to thy people. Go to Man". The result thereof is told in [...] "The Spring Running".|$|R
