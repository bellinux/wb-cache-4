Over {{the next three years}} he headed two deputations to London <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> this overturned and became the leading figure in the movement to restore the South African Republic's independence, culminating in the Boers' victory in the First Boer War of 1880–81. Kruger served until 1883 as a member of an executive triumvirate, then was elected President.

25|$|Some {{parents want}} <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a baby very {{soon after the}} miscarriage. The {{decision}} of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult. Reasons exist that may prompt parents to consider another pregnancy. For older mothers, {{there may be some}} sense of urgency. Other parents are optimistic that future pregnancies are likely to be successful. Many are hesitant and {{want to know about the}} risk of having another or more miscarriages. Some clinicians recommend that the women have one menstrual cycle before attempting another pregnancy. This is because the date of conception may be hard to determine. Also, the first menstrual cycle after a miscarriage can be much longer or shorter than expected. Parents may be advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage, molar pregnancy or are undergoing tests. Some parents wait for six months based upon recommendations from their health care provider.|$|E

500|$|... another non-fiction travelogue which Steinbeck {{wrote in}} 1962, {{is seen as}} a more rounded view of the author late in life, but The Log from the Sea of Cortez is {{regarded}} as showing the direct influence of Ed Ricketts and his philosophies on Steinbeck, and provides clues to the underlying rationales for some events in his novels. In particular, [...] "About Ed Ricketts" [...] reveals how closely he was tied to the characters in Steinbeck's novels: parts are taken almost verbatim from descriptions of [...] "Doc" [...] in Cannery Row. The book is also important for seeing something of Ed Ricketts himself. It was the only example of his philosophical writings published in his lifetime. The [...] "Essay on Non-teleological Thinking" [...] was part of a trilogy of philosophical essays he had written before the trip, and which, with Steinbeck's help, he continued <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> published until his death.|$|E

Couples can choose to keep them frozen, donate them to other infertile couples, thaw them, or donate them to medical research. Keeping them frozen costs money, donating them does not ensure they will survive, thawing them renders them immediately unviable, and medical research results in their termination.

At the end of the sixth inning, after being challenged by teammates Sam Crawford and Jim Delahanty to do something about it, Cobb climbed into the stands and attacked Lucker, who it turned out was handicapped (he had lost all of one hand and three fingers on his other hand in an industrial accident). When onlookers shouted at him to stop because the man had no hands, he reportedly retorted, [...] "I don't care if he got no feet!"
