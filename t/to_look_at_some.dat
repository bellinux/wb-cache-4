As {{they developed}} {{the character and}} the show Colbert and his staff began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> more specific models. Bill O'Reilly, whom the character affectionately nicknames [...] "Papa Bear", is the most commonly cited point of reference. In a 2006 episode of The Colbert Report, Colbert remarked that, [...] "if it wasn't for , this show wouldn’t exist". In adapting the character for the Report, Colbert has also mentioned Aaron Brown, Anderson Cooper, Sean Hannity, Lou Dobbs and Joe Scarborough as having an influence over his performance. References to the character's abuse of prescription drugs {{are believed to be}} an allusion to Rush Limbaugh's addiction to painkillers.|$|E

[...] " [...] the '90s, I was so overwhelmed with my heroin addiction, and so {{a lot of the stuff}} was just from my point of view. Now, I tend <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> of the greats like Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan. I look at their storytelling [...] I try to tell stories. Every song doesn't have to be narcissistically written about how I feel on that day." [...] Stone Temple Pilots became the third album Weiland had ever recorded sober, after Velvet Revolver's Libertad and Stone Temple Pilot's first album, Core. Weiland was also influenced by his ex-wife, Mary Forsberg, about whom he specifically wrote on [...] "Cinnamon". Weiland's inspiration for [...] "First Kiss on Mars" [...] came from the music itself. He explained his lyrics succinctly: [...] "When I first heard , it sounded intergalactic." [...] Critics and interviewers of the band noticed that Weiland's vocalizations were drawn from David Bowie.|$|E

2500|$|Since the Hubble [...] "{{constant}}" [...] is {{a constant}} only in space, not in time, the radius of the Hubble sphere may increase or decrease over various time intervals. The subscript '0' indicates {{the value of the}} Hubble constant today. Current evidence suggests that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating (see Accelerating universe), meaning that, for any given galaxy, the recession velocity dD/dt is increasing over time as the galaxy moves to greater and greater distances; however, the Hubble parameter is actually thought to be decreasing with time, meaning that if we were <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> fixed distance D and watch a series of different galaxies pass that distance, later galaxies would pass that distance at a smaller velocity than earlier ones.|$|E
