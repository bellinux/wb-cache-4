Soul Train was a , music variety show that featured social dancing and performances by African-American soul, funk, and R singers.

Before deciding that every Soul Reaper had swords, Kubo thought that they all should use guns, while only Rukia used a scythe. However, this was changed as he created <b>the</b> <b>Soul</b> Reaper kimono. Kubo also mentioned that Rukia did not seem like a lead character, so he created Ichigo Kurosaki to be the series protagonist. Ichigo's initial design had black hair like Rukia; Kubo had to modify Ichigo's appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair and a trademark scowl.|$|E

In Soul Reaver, Raziel—Kain's lieutenant—is executed by Kain, but The Elder God resurrects him and encourages him to exact revenge. Traversing the wasteland and murdering the vampires, Raziel confronts Kain, who attacks him with <b>the</b> <b>Soul</b> Reaver sword, imbued with a spirit which absorbs its victims' souls. <b>The</b> <b>Soul</b> Reaver shatters when it strikes Raziel, and the blade's spirit binds itself to his arm.
