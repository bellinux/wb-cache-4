The effect for the combination of several numbers of bulks was also investigated for several kinds of shapes to obtain large area of bulk surface in spite of one large bulk. In this calculation, the simple magnetization process replaced by the field-cool magnetization was used to obtain the equivalent distribution of the magnetic field, and the thermal equation in FEM was omitted. The <b>trapped</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> for the triangular bulk by FEM was compared with the experimental result.

40|$|PosterInternational audienceIn {{order to}} design and {{understand}} some new electrical applications using superconducting permanent magnets, which have some very high <b>trapped</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> {{it is necessary to}} study their demagnetization. In a motor, for example, the magnets are submitted to a variable magnetic field. This could demagnetize the superconducting magnets which are themselves magnetized by a variable magnetic field. So we propose new experimentation in order to study the influence of an alternating external magnetic field on superconducting magnets. Our experiments are carried out in a liquid nitrogen bath, and we use YBCO superconducting bulk pellets. During the first step, we have magnetized a superconducting bulk in an iron core by a PFM method. The iron core represents the equivalent magnetic circuit of an electrical motor.

40|$|We {{report an}} {{investigation}} {{to establish the}} physical mechanisms responsible for decoherence in the generation of photon pairs from atomic ensembles, via the protocol of Duan et. al for long distance quantum communication [Nature (London) 414, 413 (2001) ] and present the experimental techniques necessary to properly control the process. We develop a theory to model in detail the decoherence process in experiments with magneto-optical traps. The inhomogeneous broadening of the ground state by the <b>trap</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is identified as the principal mechanism for decoherence. In conjunction with our theoretical analysis, we report a series of measurements to characterize and control the coherence time in our experimental setup. We use copropagating stimulated Raman spectroscopy to access directly the ground state energy distribution of the ensemble. These spectroscopic measurements allow us to switch off the <b>trap</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> in a controlled way, optimizing the repetition rate for single-photon measurements. With the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> off, we then measure nonclassical correlations for pairs of photons generated by the ensemble {{as a function of}} the storage time of the single collective atomic excitation. We report coherence times longer than 10 microseconds, corresponding to an increase of two orders of magnitude compared to previous results in cold ensembles. The coherence time is now two orders of magnitude longer than the duration of the excitation pulses. The comparison between these experimental results and the theory shows good agreement. Finally, we employ our theory to devise ways to improve the experiment by optical pumping to specific initial states. Comment: 16 pages, 11 figures, submitted for publicatio...|$|R
