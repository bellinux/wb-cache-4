However, in some medical circles, it can instead be more commonly known as Macklin's Syndrome after L. Macklin, in 1939, and M.T. and C.C. Macklin, in 1944, who cumulatively went on to describe the pathophysiology in more detail.|$|E

5|$|Scientists at <b>the</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> University Applied Physics Laboratory {{think that}} Voyager 1 entered the {{termination}} shock in February 2003.

The issue would not be resolved until other data became available, since Voyager 1s solar-wind detector ceased functioning in 1990. This failure meant that termination shock detection would have to be inferred from the data from the other instruments on board.|$|E
