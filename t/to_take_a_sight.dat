On December 17, 1837, as he was nearing the coast of Wales, he was uncertain of his position after several days of cloudy weather and no sights. A momentary opening in the clouds allowed him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sight</b> of the sun which he reduced with his estimated latitude. Measuring the longitude depended on knowing the latitude accurately. Being uncertain about the latitude he reduced the sight again using 10' greater and 20' greater latitude, plotted the longitude for each one, and he observed that all three resulting positions were located {{in a straight line}} which also happened to pass through Smalls Lighthouse (off the coast of Pembrokeshire in Wales). He reasoned that he must be located somewhere along that line and so he set course along that line reasoning that he should eventually sight the light which, in fact he did. He realized that a single observation of the altitude of a celestial body determines the position of a line somewhere on which the observer is located. Sumner published his findings six years later in 1843 and this method of resolving a sight for two different latitudes and drawing a [...] "line {{of position}}" [...] through the two positions obtained was an important development in celestial navigation. The method was instantly recognized as important and a copy of the pamphlet describing the method was supplied to every ship in the United States Navy.|$|E

60|$|My dearest Fanny,--Set me {{down as a}} wretch, but hear me. I {{have been}} ill again, in the first place; then as weak as a rag in consequence, and then with {{business}} accumulated on impotent hands; proofs to see to, and the like. You may have heard in the buzz of newspapers of certain presentation swords, subscribed for by twenty thousand Romans, at a franc each, and presented in homage and gratitude to Napoleon III. and Victor Emmanuel. Castellani[72] of course was the artist, and the whole business had to be huddled up at the end, because of his Holiness denouncing all such givers of gifts as traitors to the See. So just as the swords had to be packed up and disappear, some one came with <b>a</b> shut carriage <b>to</b> <b>take</b> me for <b>a</b> <b>sight</b> of these most exquisite works of art. It was five o'clock {{in the evening and}} raining, but not cold, so that the whole world here agreed it couldn't hurt me. I went with Robert therefore; we were received at Castellani's most flatteringly as poets and lovers of Italy; were asked for autographs; and returned in a blaze of glory and satisfaction, to collapse (as far as I'm concerned) in a near approach to mortality. You see I can't catch a simple cold. All my bad symptoms came back. Suffocations, singular heart-action, cough tearing one to atoms. A gigantic blister, however, let me crawl out of bed {{at the end of a}} week, and the advantage of a Roman climate told, I dare say, for the attack was less violent and much less long than the one in the summer. Only I feel myself brittle, and become aware, of increased susceptibility. Dr. Gresonowsky warns me against Florence in the winter. I must be warm, they say. Well, never mind! Now I am well again, and I don't know why I should have whined so to you. I am well, and living on asses' milk by way of sustaining the mental calibre; yes, and able to have tête-à-têtes with Theodore Parker, who believes nothing, you know, and has been writing a little Christmas book for the young just now, to prove how they should keep Christmas without a Christ, and a Mr. Hazard, a spiritualist, who believes everything, walks and talks with spirits, and impresses Robert with a sense of veracity, which is more remarkable. I like the man much. He holds the subject on high grounds, takes the idea and lives on it above the earth. For years he has given himself to investigation, and has seen the Impossible. Certainly enough Robert met him and conversed with him, and came back to tell me what an intelligent and agreeable new American acquaintance he had made, without knowing that he was Hazard the spiritualist, rather famous in his department.... Don't fall out of heart with investigation. It <b>takes</b> patient investigation <b>to</b> establish the number of legs of a newly remarked fly. Nothing riles me so much as the dogmatism of the people who pronounce on there being nothing to see, because in half a dozen experiments, perhaps, they have seen nothing conclusive.|$|R

50|$|A fix {{is called}} a running fix when {{one or more of}} the LOPs used to obtain it is an LOP {{advanced}} or retrieved over time. In order to get a fix the LOP must cross at an angle, the closer to 90° the better. This means the observations must have different azimuths. During the day, if only the Sun is visible, it is possible to get an LOP from the observation but not a fix as another LOP is needed. What may be done is <b>take</b> <b>a</b> first <b>sight</b> which yields one LOP and, some hours later, when the Sun's azimuth has changed substantially, <b>take</b> <b>a</b> second <b>sight</b> which yields <b>a</b> second LOP. Knowing the distance and course sailed in the interval, the first LOP can be advanced to its new position and the intersection with the second LOP yields a running fix.|$|R
