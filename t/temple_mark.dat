2500|$|Luke {{seems to}} have taken as his model the works of two {{respected}} Classical authors, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who wrote a well-known history of Rome, and the Jewish historian Josephus, author of a history of the Jews. Like them, he anchors his history by dating the birth of the founder (Romulus for Dionysius, Moses for Josephus, Jesus for Luke) and like them he tells how the founder is born from God, taught authoritatively, and appeared to witnesses after death before ascending to heaven. By and large the sources for Acts can only be guessed at, but Luke would have had access to the Septuagint (a Greek translation of the Jewish scriptures), the gospel of Mark and the collection of [...] "sayings of Jesus" [...] called the Q source. He transposed a few incidents from Mark's gospel to the time of the Apostles—for example, the material about [...] "clean" [...] and [...] "unclean" [...] foods in Mark 7 is used in Acts 10, and Mark's account of the accusation that Jesus has attacked the <b>Temple</b> (<b>Mark</b> 14:58) is used in a story about Stephen (Acts 6:14).) There are also points of contacts (meaning suggestive parallels but something less than clear evidence) with 1 Peter, the Letter to the Hebrews, and 1 Clement. Other sources can only be inferred from internal evidence—the traditional explanation of the three [...] "we" [...] passages, for example, is that they represent eye-witness accounts. The search for such inferred sources was popular in the 19th century, but by the mid-20th it had largely been abandoned.|$|E

50|$|The other {{statues of}} the Jain <b>temple</b> <b>mark</b> Samvat 1232 (1175 AD) as their dates. Perhaps the {{earliest}} historical {{fact is that}} in Samvat 1182 (1125 AD), Jagdusha, a Jain merchant and philanthropist who had made a fortune as a grain dealer {{in a time of}} famine, received a grant of Bhadresar and had the temple so thoroughly repaired that all traces of antiquity were removed. He died without heirs in 1181 (Samvat 1238) and the village fell into the hands Naughan Vaghela and his vakils Ajjaramal Shantidas and Nagandas Tejpal. Vastupal-Tejapal, the ministers in court of Viradhaval of Vaghela dynasty visited the temple with Sangha in Samvat 1286 and was well received by Navghan. They managed to convince Viradhaval to get his daughter married with Sarangdev, the grandson of Navghan. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries this was a most popular place of pilgrimage among Jains.|$|E
