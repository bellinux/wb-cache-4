5|$|By lap 105, Kyle Busch held a 3.1-second {{lead over}} Kenseth. Three laps later, the third caution was {{triggered}} when Stewart's car made heavy {{contact with the}} turn-two wall after his right-front <b>tire</b> <b>burst.</b> Stewart grazed his foot and climbed out of his car; emergency workers helped take him to a waiting car that {{took him to the}} infield medical center for further examination. All of the race leaders, including Edwards, chose to make pit stops for tires and car adjustments under caution. NASCAR required Edwards to fall back {{to the end of the}} longest line because one of his crew members had allowed one of his tires to roll away from his pit box during his stop. Kyle Busch maintained the lead at the restart on lap 114; he was followed by Kenseth and Gordon. Kenseth passed Kyle Busch to take the lead on lap 117. On the same lap, Gordon passed Busch. By lap 135, Kenseth had opened up a 2.2-second lead over Gordon. Biffle moved in front of Burton for fourth place on the 139th lap. On lap 144, Robby Gordon's right-front tire blew, causing him to hit the turn-two wall, and the fourth caution was triggered. All of the race leaders made pit stops during the caution.|$|E

25|$|On March 1, 1978, two tires {{burst in}} {{succession}} on a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 on Continental Airlines Flight 603 during its takeoff roll at LAX and the plane, bound for Honolulu, veered off the runway. A third <b>tire</b> <b>burst</b> and the DC-10's left landing gear collapsed, causing a fuel tank to rupture. Following the aborted takeoff, spilled fuel ignited and enveloped the center {{portion of the}} aircraft in flames. During the ensuing emergency evacuation, {{a husband and wife}} died when they exited the passenger cabin onto the wing and dropped down directly into the flames. Two additional passengers died of their injuries approximately three months after the accident; 74 others aboard the plane were injured, as were 11 firemen battling the fire.|$|E

His duties also extended to delivering cars to the more important customers, reportedly on one occasion suffering twenty <b>tire</b> <b>bursts</b> or punctures between Birmingham and Brighton on a single delivery job.|$|R
50|$|March 3, 1974: A Douglas DC-7C/F (EI-AWG) {{operating}} an Aer Turas Teo {{charter flight}} from Dublin landed at Luton Airport on runway 08 {{just after midnight}} but failed to achieve reverse thrust. Normal braking application also was ineffective and the emergency pneumatic brakes were applied. All main wheel <b>tires</b> <b>burst.</b> The aircraft overran the runway and continued over the steep bank at the eastern perimeter finally coming to rest in soft ground 90 metres beyond. The situation had also been made worse by an inadvertent application of forward thrust by the crew in trying to achieve reverse thrust. Three of the six passengers {{and two of the}} four crew were injured. The aircraft was badly damaged and deemed a write-off.|$|R
5000|$|Aircraft {{tires are}} usually {{inflated}} with nitrogen to minimize expansion and contraction from extreme changes in ambient temperature and pressure experienced during flight. Dry nitrogen expands {{at the same}} rate as other dry atmospheric gases (normal air is about 80% nitrogen), but common compressed air sources may contain moisture, which increases the expansion rate with temperature. Aircraft tires generally operate at high pressures, up to [...] for airliners, and even higher for business jets. Tests of airliner aircraft tires have shown that they are able to sustain pressures of maximum [...] before bursting. During the tests the tires have to be filled with water, to prevent the test room being blown apart by the energy that would be released by a gas when the <b>tire</b> <b>bursts.</b>|$|R

The plane broke into three pieces, but despite its full load of fuel did not catch fire. The accident was visible from Highway 401, which runs alongside the south side of the airport.|$|R

He backed the car to a considerable distance, then walked forward. He appeared to be busy around the boulder for a moment and returned down the road on the run. A heavy explosion, a cloud of dust, and a rattle of falling fragments told Madeline that her indomitable driver had cleared a passage with dynamite. He seemed to be prepared for every emergency. Madeline looked to see what effect the discovery of Link carrying dynamite would have upon the silent Nels.|$|R
