40|$|Purpose of review: Much of {{the recent}} {{research}} literature {{in the field of}} prebiotics is on galacto-oligosaccharides. Gluco-oligosaccharides represent an interesting emerging class of candidate prebiotics. Recent findings: Recent research on galacto-oligosaccharides has shown <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> a positive impact on immunity, calcium absorption and markers of metabolic syndrome. The fact that galacto-oligosaccharides and gluco-oligosaccharides are enzymatically manufactured means that novel forms have been produced, and preliminary evaluation looks to be encouraging. Summary: Galacto-oligosaccharides are rapidly gaining an impressive weight of evidence for health effects in humans. The field will generate novel molecules, which may be considered as prebiotics in the future. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Joint bidding is the {{practice}} {{of two or more}} independent suppliers submitting a single bid. In Europe, the regulation of joint bidding in procurement varies a lot across countries, and is in several cases related to the inability of an individual firm to be admitted as a solo bidder. In {{the first part of the}} paper we analyse the basic economics of bidding consortia and the effects <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> in terms of coordination among firms, risk management and exploitation of synergies. In the second part we compare several practical criteria for limiting bidding consortia in a consistent way by assessing their relative degrees of restrictiveness...|$|E

As a by-product of these studies, we introduce a method for measuring population diversity with the GGA model and note that diversity seems to have huge consequences on the cost implications of the algorithm. We also witness that the algorithm can behave quite differently with varying sized instances, introducing scaling-up issues that could, quite possibly, apply to grouping genetic algorithms as a whole. ...|$|E

Twelve in-depth interviews were conducted with students and teachers. The results indicate that the use of PBL is viewed with suspicion and restriction by students, while teachers believe that this methodology is a tool that aids student transformation. Distance learning is also viewed with caution by both parties, because of the stigma still attached to it, although both agree that it plays a key role as a teaching aid. Teaching innovations aim for greater student autonomy and multidisciplinary projects, which enable a broader view not restricted to the discipline. Finally, it was found that assessment systems must be reviewed by teachers and that preference is given for mixed forms that take individual aspects of students into account...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study {{described}} in this chapter is to demonstrate how gender stereotypes can be uncovered in language teaching, whilst refining the notion of ‘critical cultural awareness’ through the concepts of ‘ideology’ and ‘essentialism’. The research was located in the British Higher Education sector and consisted of three case studies replicated with different groups of learners totalling 68 final year honours undergraduates learning the Spanish language. It focused on bringing views of Hispanic gender identities to the fore as a consciousness-raising pedagogical strategy through the reading of a short story about the experiences of two women from the impoverished suburbs of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The research comprises documentary data (students’ diaries) and conversational data (class discussions, oral presentations and interviews). The chapter describes the teaching approach {{and the ways in which}} students reacted and responded to the literary text. It also provides empirical evidence of what ‘critical cultural awareness’ means in this study with suggestions of how it can be pedagogically developed. The results of the study indicate that when literature is used as a consciousness-raising resource, it can lead to an increased awareness of ethnocentric views and the impact <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> on intercultural relationships...|$|E
40|$|Methods are {{considered}} for the indirect determination of the mobility of structure-borne sound sources. Instead of performing measurements on the source in the free state, the source mobility is obtained from measurements made in-situ. This approach is beneficial if the source is difficult to suspend, or if it contains nonlinear structural elements. Two formulations for an indirect source mobility are derived theoretically. The first requires measurement of velocities at or near to the contact points. The second involves measurement of remote velocities only. Neither of the methods requires excitation at the contacts in the coupled state. Numerical simulations of coupled beams are used to validate the two methods and investigate their accuracy and reliability with respect to typical measurement errors, such as background noise and inaccuracies in sensor positioning. It is found <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> {{a significant effect on}} the methods considered. Several experimental case studies with single-contact and multi-contact sources are performed. The results confirm the validity of the two methods in principle, but highlight their sensitivity to experimental errors.

It uses an action research approach to foreground intervention strategies used to support children entering school with speech and language delay. Data collection took an interpretivist approach, acknowledging the diverse range of variables present in a child’s life, and sought to focus upon the lived experience of practitioners supporting children’s language development within the study school. The following paper reflects upon the impact of the project so far. It indicates a shift in culture at the school, with a greater emphasis and value being placed upon tools to support children’s language enrichment, recognizing the impact <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> on a child’s confidence and independence. Conversely it also identifies some fundamental issues which remain; the most concerning being that the skills needed to support the development of children’s speech and language remain lacking within initial teacher training. It highlights the necessity for professional development within speech, language and communication to be fully acknowledged at policy level if we are to adequately cater for the needs of our children, especially those who are most vulnerable...|$|E
40|$|Joint bidding is the {{practice}} {{of two or more}} independent suppliers submitting a single bid, a widespread practice in private and public procurement. This practice may generate efficiencies through synergies and information sharing, but may also be abused {{to reduce the number of}} competitors or-even worse-to facilitate or enforce collusion among them; therefore, it is often regulated. In this paper, we first present results from a survey on the regulation of joint bidding in European public procurement, documenting how the existence and the type of regulation differ across countries, and that-where present-regulation is often related to the ability of an individual firm to be admitted as a solo bidder. Borrowing from the theories of joint bidding in auctions and of horizontal mergers and joint ventures in oligopoly, we then review the basic economics of bidding consortia and the effects <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> in terms of bidding competition, coordination among firms, risk management, exploitation of other synergies, and entry. Finally, we assess the relative degrees of restrictiveness of several practical criteria that could be used to create consistent regulatory requirements for bidding consortia in public procurement. The only strong conclusion that we can draw is that there is an urgent need for further theoretical and empirical or experimental research on this very important issue for public procurement.

40|$|Abstract- Taking care of {{migrants}} constitutes {{a new challenge}} for the actual operative structures of the services in general and for the sanitary service in particular, requiring a global and permanent rethinking with regards to both the offer and the procedures for decoding the requests. What determines the complexity of offering care while respecting differences {{is the fact that}} it can not be done without the professionals individually deconstructing racism and maturing an anti-racist awareness. However, attention to this question is neither widespread nor shared during the training of doctors and of health service workers in general. It is necessary, therefore, to broaden the traditional staff-client relationship (usually articulated in the dyad staff-subject/client-object) until it is recognized that both parts have a double role, both as a subject and as an object, within the aid process. The transcultural model is based on the concept of reciprocity. What the transcultural relationship involves is a parallel process of a redefinition of identity, both of the doctor or health service worker and of the client: it is necessary for both to question parameters that they considered certain, overcoming their inevitable resistance in the process. It appears necessary to explore within the training programs the strategies that people, in this specific case the professionals whose work regards health, adopt to avoid challenging racism and the implications <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> in their daily duties...|$|E
