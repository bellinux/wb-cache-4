"There is no {{scientific}} discoverer, no poet, no painter, no musician, {{who will not}} <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> found ready made his discovery or poem or picture — that {{it came to him}} from outside, and that he did not consciously create it from within."

2500|$|Love {{remained}} in Dallas until 1928. [...] In 1926, he won 21 games and recorded 216 strikeouts, {{as he led}} Dallas to the Texas League pennant with a victory over the New Orleans Pelicans in the Dixie Series. The Sporting Life reported at the time:"Few pitchers in baseball have more speed than Slim Love. There aren't any with a more wicked cross-fire. There isn't a left-handed hitter in the Texas League that wouldn't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would give his first pay check in on a pool to buy Love and sell {{him out of the}} league. And for the reason that New Orleans is being counted upon to offer a string of left-handed batsmen, Love is expected to be particularly effective in the Dixie Series. He is being counted on for two games and probably three if the series goes the limit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{matter of}} fifty-six hours ago, Miss Fairclough. I {{am happy to}} <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was looking, under the circumstances, quite {{reasonably}} well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{after that}} I suppose I've got to forgive you. Since you have asked after Bill at last, I may <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> very well indeed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I imagine," [...] {{continued}} Stoutenburg, [...] "that he hath {{tried to}} palliate his own villainies by <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was merely a}} paid agent in that abominable outrage." ...|$|R
60|$|Prendergast {{suddenly}} {{changed the}} conversation. When a fellow <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has left school unexpectedly, {{it is not}} always tactful to inquire the reason. He began to talk about himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw Farmer Brown's boy {{throwing}} {{something over}} there," [...] replied Peter. [...] "Didn't we <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would be good}} to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did your torngak <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a Kablunet?" [...] asked Okiok simply-- so {{simply that}} {{there was no room for}} Ujarak to take offence.|$|E
6000|$|... "You've got me there," [...] said Jason, [...] "but I have {{it pretty}} straight. Any {{one of your}} reporters will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> looks sick."....|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{a gentleman}} {{who has been}} living in the village for {{the last four or five}} months, sir. I do not think there can be any harm in my <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> knows where Captain Mervyn is to be found." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think he}} liked it. But {{whether he would}} have persevered without it you must ask yourself. If <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would never have said another word to you only for this frock, then I {{think you ought to}} thank Sir Harry, and give him a kiss." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's another thing," [...] he said, {{swinging}} round {{suddenly and}} causing his sister to drop another stitch. [...] "Maybe you think he's {{some kind of}} a Dago, this guy? Maybe <b>that's</b> what's biting <b>you.</b> Let me <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> an American--pretty near as much an American as you are yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Victor, be reasonable," [...] she protested; [...] "suggest a way {{yourself}} {{if you think it}} so easy. I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never leaves the room!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Earl Harold arrived an hour since," [...] {{the officer}} said, [...] "and bade me <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is lodged at the reeve's, where he expects you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, my dear. He {{told me to}} <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would come}} and see you; but {{to tell the truth}} I had {{forgotten}} all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{is indeed}} madness. Hast thou heard a star whisper? Did Ul, thy father, <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> heard the stars whisper {{when he was}} in the tree-top? And of what moment is it that a star be a piece of the day, seeing that its light is of no value? Thou art a fool! ...|$|R
60|$|Christiana, the Merciful One {{has sent}} me to <b>tell</b> <b>thee,</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> is a God ready to forgive, and <b>that</b> <b>He</b> taketh delight to {{multiply}} to pardon offences. He also would have <b>thee</b> know, <b>that</b> <b>He</b> inviteth <b>thee</b> to come into His presence, to His table, and <b>that</b> <b>He</b> will feed <b>thee</b> with the fat of His house, and with the heritage of Jacob thy father.|$|R
6000|$|... "Put on your cap at once, and I will go {{down with}} you," [...] Captain Lister said; [...] "and mind, I think if I were you I should say nothing {{about it at the}} depôt until <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has done with <b>you.</b> Knowing <b>that</b> the man is a learner might have just the {{opposite}} effect of hearing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is a crack shot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, when I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{is riding}} from London, while I have come thence by sea, you may suppose {{that we thought}} the matter urgent." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Celia put {{her arms}} about him, and {{answered}} very tenderly,--"Ben, dear, if I were to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was never coming back, could you bear it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm so glad William is coming. Did he <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> sent me his manuscript? I think it's wonderful--I think he's almost {{good enough}} for you, Katharine." ...|$|E
50|$|It’s no {{accident}} that a minister’s son from Alabama ended up nominated for a Grammy in 2013 for “Best R&B Song” thanks to a chart-blazing ANTHONY HAMILTON song entitled "Pray For Me". And one look at J. Que’s credentials - two Grammy Nominations, five BMI Awards and song writing credits for artists like BEYONCE, JUSTIN BIEBER, USHER and BRITNEY SPEARS - <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he’s</b> experienced some major opportunities that any capable producer would die for.|$|R
6000|$|It was upbraided to that {{excellent}} poet, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{an enemy}} to {{the writings of}} his predecessor Lucilius, because he had said, Lucilium lutulentum fluere, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> ran muddy; and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> ought to have retrenched from his satires many unnecessary verses. But Horace makes Lucilius himself to justify him from the imputation of envy, by <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would have done the}} same, had he lived in an age which was more refined: ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Hastings, my Lords, plainly <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did {{not think}} the man's talents to be extraordinary, and he soon {{afterwards}} says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had a great many incapacities. <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has a doubt whether {{he was capable of}} realizing those hopes of revenue which he (Mr. Hastings) had formed. Nor can this be matter of wonder, when we consider <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had ruined and destroyed the ancient system, the whole scheme and tenor of public offices, and had substituted nothing for them but his own arbitrary will. He had formed a plan of an entire new system, in which the practical details had no reference to the experience and wisdom of past ages. He did not take the government as he found it; he did not take the system of offices as it was arranged to his hand; but he dared to make the wicked and flagitious experiment which I have stated,--an experiment upon the happiness of a numerous people, whose property he had usurped and distributed in the manner which has been laid before your Lordships. The attempt failed, and he is responsible for the consequences.|$|R
6000|$|At {{this moment}} a tall, fair young fellow, {{dressed in a}} ranger's uniform, entered the room, {{and made his way}} {{directly}} to the spot where Lee, her mother, and Redfield were standing. [...] "Mr. Supervisor, Cavanagh has sent me to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> needs a doctor. He's got a sick man up at The Station, and he's afraid it's a case of smallpox." [...] He turned to Lee. [...] "He told me to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have written, only he was afraid to even send a letter out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must have}} mistaken him," [...] said Sir Charles. [...] "He {{told me to}} <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not {{forgotten}} his promise, and that you may rely on him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not terrified," [...] she replied, [...] "but I {{think it}} best to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> also has suspicions, absurd though it may seem, of Phillips and the doctor." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{process of}} time {{there came a}} post to the town again, and his {{business}} was with Mr. Ready-to-halt. So he inquired him out, and said to him, I am come to thee {{in the name of}} Him whom thou hast loved and followed, though upon crutches; and my message is to <b>tell</b> <b>thee,</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> expects <b>thee</b> at His table to sup with Him, in His kingdom, the next day after Easter; wherefore prepare thyself for this journey.[318] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{go before}} Tario," [...] replied the Lotharian. [...] "He will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> which <b>he</b> deems it best you know. I might <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> too much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Major de Brissac bade me <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> sire, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{held the}} Castle of Portillac, that the lady is safe, {{and that her}} husband is a prisoner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has done}} it in his death-struggle," [...] gasped the other hoarsely, sitting up and rubbing his throat. [...] "I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was in extremis. He cannot be far off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{apologize}} {{to you in}} advance. I must <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is a perfectly impossible person--absolutely impossible. If you are forewarned {{you will be the}} more ready to make allowances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{it is not}} for me to say one way or the other. I {{can only}} <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not help himself. But here's the beak a- comin' for us again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Precisely! He is in it, of course. I {{may as well}} <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> dead {{against my}} making a confidant of you; but I've a sort of fancy {{to hear what you}} might have to say about it. You see I'm a {{practical}} woman, and though I've thought this scheme out myself, and I believe in it, there are times when it seems to me a trifle airy. Now you're a kind of level-headed person, and living over there, your point of view would be interesting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well! He an't a dear {{one at all}} events,' {{observed}} Jonas; 'and {{he earns}} his salt, which is enough for our look-out. I was <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> hardly understands any one except my father; he always understands him, though, and wakes up quite wonderful. He's been used to his ways so long, you see! Why, I've seen him play whist, with my father for a partner; and a good rubber too; when he had no more notion what sort of people he was playing against, than you have.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As you will, Macumazahn," [...] he answered; [...] "but I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> there"--and <b>he</b> {{pointed to}} the peak--"there the white man lives. Turn which way you like, but if you turn you will perish." ...|$|R
