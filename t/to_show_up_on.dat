5|$|David Schofield as General Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben: A {{retired general}} {{and one of}} the plotters. Singer and Producer Christopher McQuarrie were {{impressed}} by Schofield's professionalism and dedication <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> set for scenes without his character, and the filmmakers expanded his role as a result.|$|E
5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a chest X-ray, and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E
25|$|For many companies, {{looking at}} more {{efficient}} energy use can {{pay off in}} the medium to long term; unfortunately, shareholders need to be satisfied in the short term, so regulatory intervention is often required, to encourage prudent conservation measures. However, as carbon intensity starts <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> balance books through organizations such as the Carbon Disclosure Project, voluntary action is starting to take place.|$|E

25|$|C. megacephala is {{considered}} important to forensic science {{because it is}} one of the first flies <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a corpse, and so the time of death can easily be determined when Chrysomya megacephala larvae are found on a body. In many forensic entomology cases either C. rufifacies or Chrysomya megacephala are found on the decaying corpse; mitochondrial DNA is the main method used to determine which subfamily is present. The species' wide geographical distribution and high fecundity also make it useful in forensic cases; C. megacephala is among the most common blowflies found.|$|E
25|$|Following {{its debut}} as a 1974 model, the sporty Laguna Type S-3 left the lineup briefly, then reappeared in January 1975. This time, it wore a rakishly slanted, urethane-covered aero-style nose {{designed}} for NASCAR (first use on a Chevrolet vehicle - later <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the 1983-88 Monte Carlo SS), louvered opera windows, {{and could be}} ordered with a vinyl half-roof. The 454 engine option was available {{for the first half}} of the model year after which the 400 engine became the top engine. Options included an Econominder gauge package, affirming again that the age of muscle was long gone.|$|E
500|$|Many {{officials}} and scientists said {{at first the}} tar balls appearance might be a coincidence unrelated to the spill. Coal Oil Point is very close and well known for the offshore seepage of oil at about [...] a day. Tar balls continued <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> beaches farther down the coast in Los Angeles County including Malibu and the South Bay beaches on Santa Monica Bay. [...] When tested, a tar ball recovered in the South Bay at Manhattan Beach matched the chemical signature of the spilled oil. Cleanup crews responded even farther south to beaches in Orange County.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} of Daniela and Karim caused controversy {{not only because}} both {{have been in a}} relationship with other partners outside, but also Karim's family being strict Muslims and he was even forbidden <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> naked <b>on</b> screen. Against all odds, Daniela and Karim remained a couple and married months after their voluntary exit which was featured on the show as well and are still together as of now.|$|R
5000|$|For {{several years}} prior <b>to</b> Luisetti <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the Stanford varsity for the 1935-36 season, Stanford {{did not have}} a winning season. For the three years Luisetti played varsity basketball, Stanford not only had winning seasons, they won the Pacific Coast Southern Division {{championship}} each year. Moreover, in those three years, Stanford {{went on to win the}} Pacific Coast championship in a best of 3 championship series with the Northern Division champions.|$|R

2500|$|In a story recounted {{several times}} by Dennis Edwards, (refuted by Otis Williams and Temptations road manager Don Foster), after {{several of these}} stunts, the {{positive}} audience reactions and a remorseful Ruffin's pleas to be let back into the act convinced the other Temptations to do so. Otis Williams informed the then still-new Edwards that the group would lay him off and rehire Ruffin while in Gaithersburg, Maryland. However, when Ruffin failed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> time the next night for his [...] "return" [...] engagement, the group kept Edwards on and ceased to entertain the prospect of rehiring Ruffin.|$|E

This time, Kousei is the one who inspires her after playing a duet with Nagi Aiza, the pianist sister of a fellow rival of his. After shedding tears and listening to it, Kaori opts for a risky surgery that will kill her if it fails, just so that she can play with him one more time.|$|E
2500|$|Hines {{provided}} the saxophonist Charlie Parker {{with his big}} break, until Parker was fired for his [...] "time-keeping" [...] – by which Hines meant his inability <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> time, despite Parker's resorting to sleeping under the band stage in his attempts to be punctual. The Grand Terrace Cafe had closed suddenly in December 1940; its manager, the cigar-puffing Ed Fox, disappeared. The 37-year-old Hines, always famously good to work for, took his band on the road full-time for the next eight years, resisting renewed offers from Benny Goodman to join his band as piano player.|$|E

When Wayans asked him who wrote it, Seagal responded by saying; [...] "I did." ...|$|R
50|$|Water levels or {{pressures}} can be contoured {{similar to}} elevation on topographic maps. Contour maps often show “bulls-eyes” around pumped wells {{that represent the}} cones of depression. In huge municipal wells, these cones of depression often can extend many miles from the pumped well. For many domestic wells, the cones of depression often are too small <b>to</b> even <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> such maps. Again, this really depends on the rate of pumping and the aquifer material.|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, Jackson's {{speech on}} the budget process gained {{national}} attention. Jackson gained also national attention {{when he was the}} only legislator <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> for work <b>on</b> a snow day in February 2015. The episode earned him a featured segment on The Rachel Maddow Show.|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{enduring}} legacies of the Buhari government has been the War Against Indiscipline (WAI). Launched on 20 March 1984, the policy tried to address the perceived lack of public morality and civic responsibility of Nigerian society. Unruly Nigerians were ordered to form neat queues at bus stops, under the eyes of whip-wielding soldiers. Civil servants who failed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> time at work were humiliated and forced to do [...] "frog jumps". Minor offences carried long sentences. Any student {{over the age of}} 17 caught cheating on an exam would get 21 years in prison. Counterfeiting and arson could lead to the death penalty.|$|E
2500|$|During a {{discussion}} about the state of their projects at the time, Ash and David J began talking about reforming Bauhaus. All four band members arranged a rehearsal, but Murphy failed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the scheduled day. The other three band members rehearsed regardless, and were inspired by the chemistry they had as a trio. As a result, Ash and the Haskins brothers formed Love and Rockets in 1985. Love and Rockets scored a US hit four years later with [...] "So Alive". The band broke up in 1999 after seven albums. Both Ash and David J released solo albums during the Love and Rockets years; Murphy contributed backing vocals to David J's 1992 single [...] "Candy on the Cross".|$|E
2500|$|At this stage, {{some of the}} {{fibroblasts}} {{begin to}} lay down bone matrix {{in the form of}} collagen monomers. These monomers spontaneously assemble to form the bone matrix, for which bone crystals (calcium hydroxyapatite) are deposited in amongst, in the form of insoluble crystals. This mineralization of the collagen matrix stiffens it and transforms it into bone. In fact, bone is a mineralized collagen matrix; if the mineral is dissolved out of bone, it becomes rubbery. Healing bone callus on average, is sufficiently mineralized <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> X-ray within 6 weeks in adults and less in children. This initial [...] "woven" [...] bone does not have the strong mechanical properties of mature bone. By a process of remodeling, the woven bone is replaced by mature [...] "lamellar" [...] bone. The whole process may take up to 18 months, but in adults, the strength of the healing bone is usually 80% of normal by 3 months after the injury.|$|E

2500|$|On July 31, 1950, Mann {{became a}} [...] "hold out" [...] when he failed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> {{the first day}} of {{practice}} for the Lions. [...] that same day, his position as a spokesman for Goebel was terminated. [...] Four days later, he was sent to the New York Yankees in payment for quarterback Bobby Layne. [...] The Lions had previously traded fullback Camp Wilson for Layne, but Wilson refused to report to the Yankees. [...] Mann later recalled that Yankees' coach Red Strader was upset about the trade. [...] Despite a good training camp, Mann received little playing time in exhibition games. [...] John Rauch, a rookie quarterback, told Mann that he had been ordered not to throw to him. [...] The day after Rauch threw a 53-yard touchdown pass to Mann in a pre-season game against the Washington Redskins, Mann was released by the Yankees. [...] He was not picked up by any other team.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1920s, when {{amplification}} made television practical, Scottish inventor John Logie Baird {{employed the}} Nipkow disk in his prototype video systems. He created his prototype {{in a little}} village called Santa Cruz {{on the island of}} Trinidad where he was recovering from an illness. He had also started work on the first color television. On March 25, 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised silhouette images in motion, at Selfridge's Department Store in London. Since human faces had inadequate contrast <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> his primitive system, he televised a talking, moving ventriloquist's dummy named [...] "Stooky Bill", whose painted face had higher contrast. By January 26, 1926 he demonstrated the transmission of an image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as the first television demonstration in history. The subject was Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson. Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. A bright light shining through a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses projected a bright spot of light that swept across the subject. A selenium photoelectric tube detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal. This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one scan line of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the famous}} dance {{sequence}} in which Gene Kelly sings the title song while spinning an umbrella, splashing through puddles and getting soaked to the skin, Kelly was sick with a [...] fever. The {{rain in the}} scene caused Kelly's wool suit to shrink during filming. A common myth is that Kelly managed to perform the entire song in one take, thanks to cameras placed at predetermined locations. However, {{this was not the}} case, as the filming of the sequence took place over 2-3 days. Another myth is that the rain was mixed with milk in order for the drops <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> better <b>on</b> camera; but the desired visual effect was produced, albeit with difficulty, through backlighting.|$|R

5000|$|Pneumoencephalography (sometimes {{abbreviated}} PEG; {{also referred}} to as an [...] "air study") was a common medical procedure in which most of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was drained from around the brain by means of a lumbar puncture and replaced with air, oxygen, or helium to allow the structure of the brain <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> more clearly <b>on</b> an X-ray image. It was derived from ventriculography, an earlier and more primitive method where the air is injected through holes drilled in the skull.|$|R
