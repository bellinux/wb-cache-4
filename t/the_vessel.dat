5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts {{feared that}} over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free oxygen in <b>the</b> <b>vessel.</b> If the bubble burned or exploded, it could rupture the pressure vessel and force the damaged reactor core into the containment building. The loss of <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> would not make a breach of containment inevitable, but it would {{increase the risk of}} a disastrous release of radioactivity.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of <b>the</b> pottery <b>vessels</b> are low, outflaring-sided vessels with a matte orange slipped surface (Aquilla Orange). Some darkening occurring from firing is evident. Also, a blotchy post-fire darkening is apparent {{on some of}} <b>the</b> <b>vessels.</b> It appears that artifacts {{were placed in the}} bottom of <b>the</b> <b>vessels.</b> <b>The</b> <b>vessels</b> placed in, rather than around, the shaft were covered with incense which was burnt long enough to darken <b>the</b> <b>vessels</b> before their deposition. Also, several cylindrical censers were recovered which are similar to those later placed in the shaft.|$|R
5|$|Around 1:00am (evidence on {{the precise}} time conflicts) on Monday, 8 January, a {{rumbling}} or cracking noise was heard from <b>the</b> <b>vessel,</b> followed shortly {{by a huge}} explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion was seen to blow men from the jetty into the sea. Local residents reported seeing Betelgeuse engulfed in a ball of fire a few moments later. A series of further explosions followed, breaking <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> in half. Much of the oil cargo still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000°C. The concrete unloading jetty crumbled and firefighters, arriving on the scene from several neighbouring towns, were unable to get near <b>the</b> <b>vessel.</b> The firefighters concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from spreading to the tanks of the storage farm and on containing the oil spillage. Local families living on the island fled for their lives.|$|E

5|$|In United States v. Gooding (1827), the Court {{construed}} {{the elements}} of the fitting out offense.

Second, the Court held that the statute could be violated by a partial fitting out (as opposed to a complete fitting out) of a vessel for that purpose. Third, the Court held thatsince slave trading was a misdemeanorthere was no distinction between principal and accessory. Fourth, the Court held that, for the statute to be violated, the fitting out must have occurred within the United States. Finally, the Court held that the statute's mens rea required that the owner intend to cause <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> to be used for slave trading, as opposed to intending that <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> be used for slave trading (by some third party).|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the difficult position of the Yugoslav Navy vessels north of Šolta and Brač, the Vis TG led by Pula sailed north from the island of Vis to draw some of the artillery fire away from the Kaštela TG. As the ships approached the Split Entrance, they made a radar contact sailing away from Split towards open sea at a high speed. Pula, attempting to enforce the blockade imposed in September, requested <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> by radio to stop for an inspection. <b>The</b> <b>vessel</b> failed to respond and Pula fired several shots {{in front of it}} before Brčić noticed that it was a hydrofoil carrying an ECMM team and flying the flag of Europe.

5|$|Once {{dissection}} has occurred, two mechanisms {{contribute to}} the development of stroke symptoms.
