500|$|On 12 December 2008, Che was {{screened}} at New York City's {{sold out}} 1,100 person Ziegfeld Theater. Upon seeing the first {{image on the}} screen (a silhouette of Cuba), the crowd erupted into a raucous cry of [...] "¡Viva, Cuba!" [...] Following the film, and the standing ovation it received, Soderbergh appeared for a post program Q During the sometimes contentious conversation with the audience, in which Soderbergh alternated between defensiveness and modesty, the director categorized Guevara as [...] "a hard ass", to which one audience member yelled out, [...] "Bullshit, he was a murderer!" [...] The filmmaker settled down the crowd and explained, [...] "It doesn't matter whether I agree with him or not—I was interested in Che as a warrior, Che {{as a guy who}} had an ideology, who picked up a gun and this was the result. He died <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have him die. He was executed <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> say he executed other people". Soderbergh ended the 1 am Q session by noting that he was [...] "agnostic" [...] on Che's standing, but [...] "loyal to the facts", which he insisted were all rigorously sourced.|$|E
500|$|Horowitz {{revealed}} the film would contain many light cycles battles, and {{asserted that the}} script for the scenes were [...] "incredibly detailed", and involved an intricate collaborative process. For the disc game, Horowitz and Kitsis wrote a rough draft of the scene, and sent the script to Kosinski; he summarized his perspective of the sequence's visuals to them. [...] "He described them as these underlying platforms," [...] said Horowitz, [...] "that would then coalesce and then <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> go from round to round in the game is you defeat someone, they kinda come together as {{you see in the}} movie." [...] After giving his intake, Kosinski sent various sketches of the scene to the writers and would often revise the script. Kitsis thought that illustrating the character's stories to be the most difficult task in writing Tron: Legacy. The writers collaborated with the creative process throughout production, which was helpful especially considering the difficulties of describing in a tangible way a digital world that [...] "in its very nature defies basic screenwriting conventions." ...|$|E
500|$|Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter {{summed up}} WrestleMania XXX as a [...] "very newsworthy show {{to say the}} least". Daniel Bryan's first match was {{described}} as a long technical one, and although Meltzer did not consider it [...] "a match of the year or probably even the week", it [...] "was the caliber of a good PPV main event". Triple H's post-match attack on Bryan was said to be a [...] "very basic" [...] storyline [...] "but it's also exactly what they should have done". Bryan's second match in the main event was described as [...] "really great" [...] with lots of twists and turns, while the match result was [...] "again exactly what they should have done" [...] and [...] "the crowd reacted <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> expect". Meltzer thought that [...] "the people just weren't into" [...] the Undertaker's match as [...] "nobody bought that Lesnar could win". Meanwhile, he felt that the Undertaker's departure was [...] "certainly teased like a retirement". For the battle royal, Meltzer noted the lack of (surprise) entrants such as Rob Van Dam, Alexander Rusev, Christian, or Wade Barrett. In other notes, Meltzer described the strong fan support for Cesaro and also labelled Cena's win as a [...] "genuine upset".|$|E

6000|$|He showed {{himself a}} {{thorough}} master of his trade in its more mechanical details, {{and there were}} signal instances of his intelligence in the higher things of it which might well have put Mrs. Maxwell to shame for her many hasty judgments of the actor. He was altogether more of a man, more of a mind, than she had supposed, even when she supposed the best of him. She perceived that Godolphin grasped the whole meaning of her husband's work, and interpreted its intentions with perfect accuracy, not only in his own part of Haxard, but in all the other persons, and he corrected the playing {{of each of the}} rôles as the rehearsal went on. She saw how he had really formed the other actors upon himself. They repeated his tones, his attitudes, his mannerisms, in their several ways. His touch could be felt all through the performance, and his limitations characterized it. He was very gentle and forbearing with their mistakes, but he was absolute master all the same. If some one erred, Godolphin left his place and went and showed how the thing should be said and done. He carefully addressed the men by their surnames, with the Mr. always; the women were all Dear to him, according to a convention of the theatre. He said, [...] "No, dear," [...] and [...] "Yes, dear," [...] and he was as caressingly deferential to each of them as he was formally deferential to the men; he required the same final obedience of them, and it was not always so easy to make them obey. In non-essentials he yielded at times, as when one of the ladies had overdone a point, and he demurred. [...] "But I always got a laugh on that, Mr. Godolphin," [...] she protested. [...] "Oh, well, my dear, hang on to your laugh, then." [...] However he meant to do Haxard himself, his voice was for simplicity and reality in others. [...] "Is that <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> do it, is that <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> say it, if it were you?"

60|$|The gaps {{through the}} Blue Ridge I {{understand}} {{to be about}} the following distances from Harper's Ferry, to wit: Vestal's, 5 miles; Gregory's, 13; Snicker's, 18; Ashby's, 28; Manassas, 38; Chester, 45; and Thornton's, 53. I should think it preferable to take the route nearest the enemy, disabling him to make an important move without your knowledge, and compelling him to keep his forces together for dread of you. The gaps would enable you to attack if you should wish. For a great part of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be practically between the enemy and both WASHINGTON and Richmond, enabling us to spare you the greatest number of troops from here. When at length running for Richmond ahead of him enables him to move this way, if he does so, turn and attack him in rear. But I think he should be engaged long before such a point is reached. It is all easy if our troops march as well as the enemy, and it is unmanly to say they cannot do it. This letter is in no sense an order.|$|E
