40|$|Abstract. This study {{investigated}} the optimum positions and warning foreperiod for auditory signals with an experiment on spatial stimulus-response (S-R) compatibility effects. The auditory signals were presented at the front-right, front-left, rear-right, and rear-left positions from the subjects, whose reaction times and accuracies at different spatial mapping conditions were examined. The results showed a significant spatial stimulus-response compatibility effect in which faster and more accurate responses were obtained in the transversely and longitudinally compatible condition while the worst performance was found when spatial stimulus-response compatibility {{did not exist in}} either orientation. It was also shown that the <b>transverse</b> <b>compatibility</b> effect was found significantly stronger than the longitudinal compatibility effect. The effect of signal position was found significant and post hoc test suggested that the emergent warning alarm should be placed on the front-right position for right-handed users. The warning foreperiod prior to the signal presentation was shown to influence reaction time and a warning foreperiod of 3 s is found optimal for the 2 -choice auditory reaction task...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of this presentation are to clarify specific terms like transparency and <b>transverse</b> <b>compatibility,</b> {{and then to}} derive guidelines as a first approach to an engineered photonic network. These guidelines are applied to the planning of a core network with 8 and 16 wavelength channels per link and verified by first numerical results. Complementary to a layered network architecture, our methodology {{is based on the}} use of a specific reference configuration. Degradation effects like amplifier noise, chromatic and polarization-mode dispersion, nonlinear self-phase modulation are covered as well as node crosstalk and the impact of optical frequency misalignments. Based on ITU-T recommendations, a classification of ranges of bit-rates and other preliminary specifications, our method allows us to assemble a general photonic network from its elements in a bottom-up scheme. As a result, we show that photonic networks can exhibit transparent optical paths, ranging from 400 to several thousands of kilometres. A number of 16 wavelength channels at individual bit-rates of up to 10 Gbit/s traversing a couple of crossconnecting nodes can be implemented, taking into account present-day optical components like amplifiers, standard fibres, multiplexers and demultiplexers, fibre switches as well as dispersion-compensating techniques. The potential benefits of such networks are to be seen in their inherent high capacity and in a high degree of flexibility, supporting various applications. Considering the results obtained so far, it can be concluded that a country of the size of Germany could be covered by a transparent photonic network...|$|E

The procedure and rationale {{used to obtain}} useful nondimensional forms of the <b>transverse</b> equilibrium and <b>compatibility</b> equations for buckling are presented. Fundamental parameters are identified that represent the importance of both membrane and bending orthotropy and anisotropy on the results...|$|R
40|$|Computational {{models of}} {{biological}} systems can provide detailed {{information that is}} not possible to obtain experimentally. Such models are often created and analyzed even though the geometry and material properties are not well understood. This approach introduces modeling errors of undetermined magnitude. An alternative approach is to use parametric variation of all model parameters to determine the validity of modeling assumptions and to identify the most and least influential model parameters. ^ The {{purpose of this study was}} to test modeling assumptions commonly applied in phonation modeling and to determine the most influential parameters of the vocal folds. A systematic analysis of the vocal fold structure was performed using finite element models of the vocal fold. Parametric variation of model parameters was a core component of this approach. ^ Simplifying assumptions commonly applied to vocal fold structural models were examined for their effect on vibratory response. These assumptions included the incompressibility and planar displacement assumptions. The incompressibility assumption was found to introduce only minor changes in modal frequency while the accuracy of planar displacement assumption was found to depend upon the ratio of longitudinal to <b>transverse</b> stiffness. <b>Compatibility</b> conditions for the proper implementation of these assumptions are provided. ^ The geometric and material parameters of vocal fold models were ranked according to their respective influence on the modal frequencies of the vocal folds. This was accomplished by simultaneous variation of all model parameters based on ranges defined for each parameter. Several different methods of sampling and analysis were used to rank the vocal fold parameters. Sample sizes ranged from 30 to 475. More than 2000 unique finite element models of the vocal folds were analyzed in the course of this study. A set of five dominant parameters were consistently identified as exerting the most influence on modal frequencies of the vocal folds. Deformed-state modal analysis was also performed to determine if these parameters were influential under loaded conditions. The same five parameters were again found to dominate the results of loaded modal analysis. A statistical model based on just seven physical parameters was able to account for over 93 % of model response. ^ Modeling assumptions were examined in detail, and the most influential vocal fold model parameters were identified. Several non-influential parameters were also identified. These results have great import for guiding future experimental studies designed to measure vocal fold tissue properties, and suggest that these parameters should be given careful consideration in future numerical models of phonation. ^ The general concept of generating large numbers of models via sampling techniques is recommended in future studies involving computational models of biological systems. Statistical analysis may then be performed, providing generalized information on trends, model sensitivities, and the validity of modeling assumptions. This approach is encouraged in future studies involving the computational modeling of biological systems. ...|$|R
