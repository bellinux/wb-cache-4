The advent of the space age accelerated the realization that many environmental problems and geo- chemical processes on Earth can only be understood in terms of ecosystems. This in turn, spurred renewed interest and activity among modem biologists, geologists and soil scientists attempting to unravel the intimate relations between biology and the weathering of silicate rocks and minerals of the earth surface...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Fluid {{models have}} been shown to be {{efficient}} and accurate in modelling large IP networks. However, unlike packet models, it is difficult to extract packet-level information from them. In this paper, we present a hybrid simulation method that maintains the performance advantage of fluid models while providing detailed packet level information for selected packet traffic flows. We propose two models to account for the interaction between background TCP traffic in a fluid network and foreground packet traffic of interest. The first assumes that the packet traffic poses a negligible load on the fluid network whereas the second accounts for the added load by transforming the packet traffic into fluid flows and solving the resulting enhanced fluid model. The first of these yields an efficient one pass solution algorithm whereas the second requires an additional <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> <b>account</b> for the packet traffic load. We establish the correctness of both approaches and present their implementation within ns- 2. Comparisons between the hybrid models and a classical packet simulation show the two <b>pass</b> approach <b>to</b> be quite accurate and computationally efficient. I...|$|R

40|$|This project {{explores the}} {{convergence}} of contemporary American novels, films, plays, and television miniseries around issues of how fiction can represent historical and contemporary traumas affecting both individuals and communities. This work examines narratives by Octavia E. Butler, Linda Hogan, Tony Kushner, and filmmaker John Sayles {{in order to examine}} the possibilities and constraints of these genres and media and their respective abilities <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> on the <b>accounts</b> of trauma, often distorted by dominant culture and history, to those within the community. Because of the distortion or erasure of these injustices, members of the dominant culture often feel unimplicated in them; these works then also have a larger audience who must be persuaded to recognize complicity in systems that have resulted from past inequities. I therefore analyze how these works create innovative strategies that address both audiences and translate cultural traumas—including slavery, the continuing dispossession of Native American lands, inner-city segregation, the U. S. /Mexico border, and the AIDS crisis—that continue to compromise the possibility for a democratic and egalitarian society. As trauma challenges the structures of knowledge, memory, and reality through its affront to temporality and structures of meaning, I analyze narrative strategies that range from subversion of genre conventions and refusal of closure to fractured narratives, innovative editing patterns, and inclusion of fantastic elements. Too often, traumas affecting racial or sexual Others have been rendered in dominant culture as 2 ̆ 2 really 2 ̆ 2 the trauma of a heroic or misunderstood member of the majority group or as evidence of 2 ̆ 2 their 2 ̆ 2 immorality; the works I examine demand a reckoning with the past as lived, remembered, or recovered by those denied a voice and, therefore, a past in the memory of the nation. ...|$|R
