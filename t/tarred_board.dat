Todor Dimitrov Nestorov (unknown - 1876) was a carver-cutter and a revolutionary, who was killed in the Bulgarian Anti-Ottoman April Uprising in 1876. The pthotograph is probably an earlier one - taken before 1876, mounted later, in 1913, on a <b>tar</b> <b>board...</b>|$|R

60|$|The timorous shadowy shapes {{descended the}} footway, one {{at least of}} them knowing the place so well that she found it {{scarcely}} necessary to guide herself down by touching the natural wall of stone on her right hand, as her companion did. Thus, with quick suspensive breathings {{they arrived at the}} bottom, and trod the few yards of shingle which, on the forbidding shore hereabout, could be found at this spot alone. It was so solitary as to be unvisited often for four-and-twenty hours by a living soul. Upon the confined beach were drawn up two or three fishing-lerrets, and a couple of smaller ones, beside them being a rough slipway for launching, and a boathouse of <b>tarred</b> <b>boards.</b> The two lovers united their strength to push the smallest of the boats down the slope, and floating it they scrambled in.|$|R
25|$|In October 1608, Newport {{brought a}} second {{shipment}} of supplies along with 70 new settlers, {{including the first}} women. Some German, Polish, and Slovak craftsmen also arrived, but they brought no food supplies. Newport brought with him a list of counterfeit Virginia Company orders which angered John Smith greatly. He wrote an angry letter in response. One of the orders was to crown the Native American leader Powhatan emperor {{and give him a}} fancy bedstead. The Company wanted Smith to pay for Newport's voyage with such as the colony could produce in the form of pitch, <b>tar,</b> sawed <b>boards,</b> soap ashes, and glass.|$|R

These remnants of the fishing industry remain where they were used and left. That they were not cleaned up and redeveloped like the valuable land around most docks is what makes Manitou Camp unique in the area.|$|R

5000|$|On 18 June 1806 the British {{privateer}} Port au Princes boats entered San Blas Bay (possibly San Blas, Nayarit), {{and captured}} Santa Anna. Santa Anna was a [...] "corbetta" [...] {{under the command}} of Captain Francisco Puertas and carrying a cargo of pitch, <b>tar,</b> and cedar <b>boards</b> to Guayaquil. The next day Captain Isaac Duck of Port au Prince sent 20 of his Spanish prisoners ashore in his longboat. Two Spaniards and two negro slaves joined Port au Prince. The slaves belonged to Santa Annas owner and legally Duck should have sent them ashore too, but they pleaded not to go have to go ashore and Duck yielded to their pleas. Duck then put Mr. Charles Maclaren in command of Santa Anna and gave him a crew of 12 men, plus a Spaniard, to navigate her to Port Jackson.|$|R

40|$|Marine borers, {{particularly}} the shipworms, as destroyers of timber, par excellence, {{are well known}} from very ancient times. They attacked the wooden hulls of ships with such intensity that the weakened bottom planks broke up even due to a mild impact caused by hitting a rock or any floating objects inducing shipwrecks. Even the survival of sunken ships as wrecks depends on the mercy of wood-destroying organisms, which may turn these ‘port-holes’ to history into meaningless junks. The silent saboteurs, involved in several early shipwrecks, are the molluscan and crustacean borers, aided by bacteria and fungi. This paper presents {{an account of the}} marine wood-borers, together with a historical review of literature on their depredation on wooden ships, and on protective methods adopted from antiquity to modern times. The seriousness with which early mariners faced the problem of bio-deterioration and the fear the wood-borers created in their minds have been brought to light with, in some cases, excerpts from their journals and books. The anxiety and concern for protecting the ships from the ravages of wood-borers and for their own safety, as evidenced from their accounts, are discussed. Classification of various groups of marine wood-borers with notes on characters of systematic value and a complete list of species so far recorded in literature have been included under Appendix I and II. Methods employed to prevent damage to the boats included deep-charring, coating with pitch, coal-tar, whale oil and mustard oil with lime; scupper nailing (‘filling’); sheathing with animal skin, hair, <b>tarred</b> paper, wooden <b>boards</b> (untreated or soaked in coal tar, Ferrous sulphate, Copper sulphate or Lead monoxide); sheathing with metals (Lead or Copper sheets); plastic, neoprene coated ply-woods; and painting with Copper oxide, Pentachlorophenol or phenylarsenious oxide. None of these imparts complete protection. Recent archaeological investigations carried out in British waters, especially on ‘Mary Rose’, are also summarised. It is suggested that, though borers are instrumental in inducing ship-wrecks thereby enriching the materials for archaeological studies, excavations at known ship-wreck sites should be augmented to unearth valuable historical data, before they are lost to satisfy the insatiable appetite of these pests...|$|R
