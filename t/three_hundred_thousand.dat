The best-known Japanese atrocity was the Nanking Massacre, in which fifty to <b>three</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> Chinese civilians were raped and murdered. Mitsuyoshi Himeta reported that 2.7 million casualties occurred during the Sankō Sakusen. General Yasuji Okamura implemented the policy in Heipei and Shantung.|$|E
5|$|The war also {{reflected}} a new height in military spending, especially by the Habsburgs. After the Seven Years' War, {{the size of}} the Habsburg military shrank, from 201,311men in arms in 1761 to 163,613in 1775. In preparing for a second summer's campaign, Joseph's army grew from 195,108effectives in the summer of 1778 to 308,555men in arms in Spring 1779. Habsburg military strength never dropped below two hundred thousand effectives between 1779 and 1792, when Austria entered the War of the First Coalition. Several times it surged above <b>three</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> men in arms, responding to needs on the Ottoman border or the revolt in the Austrian Netherlands. The military also underwent a massive organizational overhaul.|$|E
5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with <b>three</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> of your host whom I will choose.|$|E

25|$|By 480 BC, Gelo, {{the tyrant}} leader of Greek Syracuse, backed {{in part by}} support from other Greek city-states, was {{attempting}} to unite the island under his rule. This imminent threat could not be ignored, and Carthage— possibly {{as part of an}} alliance with Persia, then engaged military force under the leadership of the general Hamilcar.

25|$|Porto Velho's {{modern history}} {{begins with the}} {{discovery}} of cassiterite around the city, and of gold on the Madeira River, {{at the end of the}} 1950s. In addition, the government's decision to allow large cattle farms in the territory began a trend of migration into the city. Almost one million people moved to Rondônia, and Porto Velho's population increased to <b>three</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand.</b> This intense migration caused much trouble for the city. Among many other problems, the suburban boroughs, for example, are nothing but shanty towns.|$|E
25|$|Before {{irrigation}} development, the San Joaquin River and {{its tributaries}} once supported the third largest run of Pacific salmon in California including prodigious spring, summer, fall, and late-fall runs of chinook salmon. The California Department of Fish and Game estimated in the 1930s that the historic salmon run was likely {{in the vicinity of}} 200,000 to 500,000 of spawners annually, but by the mid-20th century, reduction in river flows led to the run dropping to about 3,000-7,000. Some sources put the historic populations as high as <b>three</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand,</b> but this is highly unlikely because of the limited habitat available in the watershed.|$|E
25|$|It is {{said that}} for the Fourth Council of Kashmir, Kaniṣka {{gathered}} 500 monks headed by Vasumitra, partly, it seems, to compile extensive commentaries on the Abhidharma, although {{it is possible that}} some editorial work was carried out upon the existing canon itself. Allegedly during the council there were altogether <b>three</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> verses and over nine million statements compiled, and it took twelve years to complete.

25|$|The Arawakan-speaking Taíno {{moved into}} Hispaniola {{from the north}} east region {{of what is now}} known as South America, {{displacing}} earlier inhabitants, c. AD 650. They engaged in farming and fishing and hunting and gathering. The fierce Caribs drove the Taíno to the northeastern Caribbean during much of the 15th century. The estimates of Hispaniola's population in 1492 vary widely, including one hundred thousand, <b>three</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand,</b> and four hundred thousand to two million. Determining precisely how many people lived on the island in pre-Columbian times is next to impossible, as no accurate records exist. By 1492 the island was divided into five Taíno chiefdoms. The Taíno name for the entire island was either Ayiti or Quisqueya.|$|E
25|$|The Qin {{sought to}} create a state unified by {{structured}} political power and a large military supported by a stable economy. The central government moved to undercut aristocrats and landowners to gain direct administrative control over the peasantry, who comprised {{the overwhelming majority of}} the population and labor force. This allowed ambitious projects, such as connecting walls along the northern border eventually developed into the Great Wall of China. These projects involved <b>three</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> peasants and convicts. The Qin introduced a range of reforms such as standardized currency, weights, measures, and a uniform system of writing, which aimed to unify the state and promote commerce. Additionally, its military used the most recent weaponry, transportation, and tactics, though the government was heavy-handedly bureaucratic. Han dynasty Confucians portrayed the dynasty as a monolithic tyranny, but this view has been rejected by modern scholars. There was indeed an attempt to restrict criticism and purge traces of old dynasties, but not the alleged burning of books and burying of scholars. Recently excavated Qin texts show a more pragmatic and eclectic approach in contrast with descriptions in traditional texts. Qin administration has been judged to be no harsher than was prevalent at the time. The Qin were not doctrinaire: Confucian and Legalist philosophies coexisted during the reign of the First Emperor.|$|E

Hattie McDaniel was also absent, as she and the other black cast members [...] were prevented from attending the premiere due to Georgia's Jim Crow laws, which would have kept them from sitting with their white colleagues.
