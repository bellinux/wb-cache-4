5|$|Donkey Kong is a {{video game}} series created by game {{designer}} Shigeru Miyamoto. It is published by Nintendo, with entries in the series developed by Nintendo, Rare, Namco, Retro Studios, and Paon. The series debuted in 1981 with the arcade game Donkey Kong, which was a sales success that brought Nintendo into the North American market. Most Donkey Kong games have either been arcade games or released for Nintendo consoles and handhelds dating from the Nintendo Entertainment System to <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> video game consoles. However, some of the original arcade games were ported into versions on third-party home consoles and developed by several companies. Donkey Kong is among the best-selling video game franchises, with more than 48 million games sold worldwide.|$|E

25|$|Given {{the short}} reads {{produced}} by <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> sequencing technologies, de novo assembly {{is a major}} computational problem. It is normally approached by an iterative process of finding and connecting sequence reads with sensible overlaps. Various computational and statistical techniques, such as de bruijn graphs and overlap layout consensus graphs, have been leveraged to solve this problem. Nonetheless, due to the highly repetitive nature of eukaryotic genomes, accurate and complete reconstruction of genome sequences in de novo assembly remains challenging. Pair end reads have been posed as a possible solution, though exact fragment lengths are often unknown and must be approximated.|$|E
25|$|Epigenetic markers are {{stable and}} {{potentially}} heritable {{modifications to the}} DNA molecule {{that are not in}} its sequence.

These techniques involve tagging the DNA strand, breaking and filtering fragments that contain markers, followed by sequencing. Third generation sequencing may enable direct detection of these markers due to their distinctive signal from the other four nucleotide bases.|$|E

25|$|Polypropylene, or 'polypro', {{has been}} used for the {{fabrication}} of cold-weather base layers, such as long-sleeve shirts or long underwear. Polypropylene is also used in warm-weather clothing, in which it transports sweat away from the skin. More recently, polyester has replaced polypropylene in these applications in the U.S. military, such as in the ECWCS. Although polypropylene clothes are not easily flammable, they can melt, which may result in severe burns if the wearer is involved in an explosion or fire of any kind.

30|$|Because of the {{computational}} {{challenge and}} the non-trivial algorithms involved, cosmological N-body simulations {{have been an}} extensively studied topic over the years. In order to frame our work in ChaNGa, we review {{some of the recent}} successes in scaling cosmological simulations on <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> supercomputers. However, direct comparison of the absolute performance among different codes is difficult. Different choices of accuracy criteria for the force evaluations and the time integration will have a big impact on performance, and the choices for these criteria will be determined by the various scientific goals of the simulation. For example, understanding the development of structures at very high redshift (e.g. Ishiyama et al. 2012) will present different parameter and algorithm choices than simulations that model <b>the</b> observations of <b>current</b> large scale structure (e.g. Habib et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{political}} sustainability {{of the existing}} pay-as-you-go social security system {{in the face of}} recent demographic patterns. We analyze different approaches to privatizing the system and consider what it would require for them to be politically implementable.

We study the sustainability of this system in each subsequent period. We describe some transitions policies that make <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> agents at least as well off as the maintenance of the social security system. All feasible transition policies use debt to finance the benefits during the transition period shifting {{at least some of the}} cost to unborn generations.

25|$|Hoffman was 52 at {{the time}} of his death on April 12, 1989, which was caused by {{swallowing}} 150 phenobarbital tablets and liquor. He had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1980. At the time he had recently changed treatment medications and was reportedly depressed when his 83-year-old mother was diagnosed with cancer (she died in 1996 at the age of 90). Some close to Hoffman, including his longtime friend David Denton and fellow Chicago Seven co-defendant Tom Hayden, claimed that as a natural prankster who valued youth, he was also unhappy about reaching middle age, combined with the fact that the ideas of the 1960s had given way to a conservative backlash in the 1980s. In 1984 he had expressed dismay that <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> young people were not as interested in protesting and social activism as youth had been during the 1960s. Hoffman's body was found in his apartment in a converted turkey coop on Sugan Road in Solebury Township, near New Hope, Pennsylvania. At the time of his death, he was surrounded by about 200 pages of his own handwritten notes, many about his own moods.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Urdu novels {{focused on}} urban social life, {{eventually}} widening in scope to include rural social life. They also covered the changing times under the progressive writing movement inspired by Sajjad Zaheer. However, {{the independence of}} Pakistan in 1947 greatly affected the novel, bringing up questions of identity and migration {{as can be seen}} in the major works of Abdullah Hussain and Quratulain Haider. Towards the end of the last century the novel took a serious turn towards the contemporary life and realities of the young generations of India. The most significant novels of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Indian novelists in Urdu, which demonstrate a new confidence in contemporary life, are Makaan by Paigham Afaqui, Do Gaz Zameen by Abdus Samad, and Pani by Ghazanfer. These works, especially Makaan, brought the Urdu novel out of the prevailing themes of the independence of Pakistan in 1947 and identity issues and took it into the realm of modern-day realities and issues of life in India. Makaan influenced many English writers such as Vikram Seth, who turned to novel writing. These Urdu novels further affected significant works such as Andhere Pag by Sarwat Khan, Numberdar Ka Neela by S M Ashraf and Fire Area by Ilyas Ahmed Gaddi. Paigham Afaqui's second major novel, Paleeta, was published in 2011 and depicts the tension of the political sickening of a common Indian citizen in the six decades after India's independence. Bewildered by the disappointing state of democracy and the transformation of Indian society into a mental desert the central character dies after leaving behind his writings which catch fire.|$|E
