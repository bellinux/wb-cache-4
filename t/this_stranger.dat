500|$|At Riebeeck West Jan {{had been}} a hard-working, deeply {{religious}} child, with a strongly reserved, almost solitary, nature. This disposition, a legacy of his pious, rural upbringing, is manifest in what is his earliest surviving letter. This letter, written to Professor C Murray, a tutor at Victoria College, was {{for the most part}} a run-of-the-mill enquiry into the administrative arrangements for the forthcoming term. Yet in amongst this mundane request for information on such matters as textbooks and school fees Jan found himself confiding his innermost motive forces to <b>this</b> <b>stranger.</b> As he wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|Magnolia finds Julie {{inside and}} announces that she's in love. Julie {{cautions}} her that <b>this</b> <b>stranger</b> {{could be just}} a [...] "no-account river fellow". Magnolia says that if she {{found out he was}} [...] "no-account", she'd stop loving him. Julie warns her that it's not that easy to stop loving someone, explaining that she'll always love Steve, singing a few lines of [...] "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man". Queenie overhears – she is surprised that Julie knows that song as she has only heard [...] "colored folks" [...] sing it. Magnolia remarks that Julie sings it all the time, and when Queenie asks if she can sing the entire song, Julie obliges.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene is}} a desolate seashore, with {{the ruins of}} a Hindu temple in the background. A chorus of pearl {{fishermen}} sing of the dangerous tasks that lie ahead (""), and perform ritual dances to drive away evil spirits. They then elect one of their number, Zurga, as their leader, or [...] "king". Nadir enters, and is hailed by Zurga as a long-lost friend. Left alone, the pair reminisce about their past in the city of Kandy, where their friendship was nearly destroyed by their mutual love of a young priestess whose beauty they had glimpsed briefly. They had each renounced their love for <b>this</b> <b>stranger</b> and had sworn to remain true to each other. Now, reunited, they affirm once again that they will be faithful until death ("Au fond du temple saint").|$|E

60|$|The {{stranger}} stood still, looking about him, and Wyllard's lips set tight. A {{thrill of}} apprehension ran through Agatha, for {{she felt that}} she knew what <b>this</b> <b>stranger's</b> errand must be.|$|R
2500|$|... "The Masque of the Red Death", {{originally}} published as [...] "The Mask of the Red Death: A Fantasy" [...] (1842), {{is a short}} story by Edgar Allan Poe. [...] The story follows Prince Prospero's attempts to avoid a dangerous plague, known as the Red Death, by hiding in his abbey. He, {{along with many other}} wealthy nobles, hosts a masquerade ball within seven rooms of the abbey, each decorated with a different color. In the midst of their revelry, a mysterious figure disguised as a Red Death victim enters and makes his way through each of the rooms. Prospero dies after confronting <b>this</b> <b>stranger,</b> whose [...] "costume" [...] proves to contain nothing tangible inside it; the guests also die in turn.|$|E
2500|$|In the woods, Uberto/King James {{has come}} to find Elena, hoping to save her from the coming battles (Cavatina: Oh fiamma soave, che l’alma mi accendi! pietosa ti rendi a un fido amator. / [...] "Oh sweet flame. Show {{compassion}} To a faithful lover"). Meanwhile, Elena asks Serano to find her father, whom she expects to see before he goes off to fight; Serano leaves. Uberto/King James then approaches Elena and declares his love, but she tells him she loves Malcolm: (Duet, leading to a trio: Elena and Uberto: Alla ragion deh rieda / [...] "Ah! may your agitated and overburdended soul Return to reason's control"). Nevertheless, Uberto gives Elena a ring he says the King gave him, and emphasizes that it will see her through any danger.

60|$|Tavernake {{turned and}} looked the man over. There was {{something}} convincing about his tone and appearance. It did not occur to him to doubt for a moment a word of <b>this</b> <b>stranger's</b> story.|$|R
60|$|Lady Cranston's {{guests were}} all {{conscious}} {{of a little}} indefinable disappointment. The gossip concerning <b>this</b> <b>stranger's</b> appearance in Dreymarsh was practically strangled. Mrs. Johnson, however, fired a parting shot as she rose to go.|$|R
6000|$|... "Has your Majesty {{any doubt}} of <b>this</b> <b>stranger's</b> guilt? There {{is the very}} sword with which he meant to slay you. How sharp, and bright, and terrible it is! Quick!--let him taste the wine; or perhaps he may do the deed even yet." ...|$|R

50|$|When a {{documentary}} crew {{traveling through the}} Amazon jungle picks up a stranded man, they are unaware of the trouble that will occur. <b>This</b> <b>stranger's</b> hobby is to capture the giant Anaconda snake, and plans to continue targeting it on their boat, by any means necessary.|$|R
60|$|She had lovers--no girl of her charm {{could move}} without meeting the admiring glances of men; but <b>this</b> <b>stranger's</b> regard {{was so much}} more subtly exalting--it held an impersonal quality--it went beyond her entire understanding, adding an element of mystery to herself, to him, and to the sunset.|$|R
60|$|He {{held by the}} arm {{a slight}} man whom he was urging along with no gentle force. <b>This</b> <b>stranger's</b> face {{presented}} as great a contrast to Blicky's as could have been imagined. His apparel proclaimed his calling. There were consternation and bewilderment in his expression, but very little fear.|$|R
60|$|In {{his fear}} and trouble {{it seemed to}} Isaac as if <b>this</b> <b>stranger</b> might render him some {{valuable}} assistance.|$|E

50|$|Clarissa's {{party in}} the evening is a slow success. It is {{attended}} {{by most of the}} characters she has met in the book, including people from her past. She hears about Septimus' suicide at the party and gradually comes to admire <b>this</b> <b>stranger's</b> act, which she considers an effort to preserve the purity of his happiness.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] said Bratti, cordially; [...] "one {{may never}} {{lose sight of}} the Cupola and yet know the world, I hope. Besides, <b>this</b> <b>stranger's</b> clothes are good Italian merchandise, and the hose he wears were dyed in Ognissanti before ever they were dyed with salt water, as he says. But the riddle about him is--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I perceive," [...] {{said the}} prince, [...] "that your master {{is a man}} of great heart and high of enterprise.

60|$|They {{had breakfast}} {{when he came}} back and both laughed when she {{prepared}} the flapjacks under his direction. She felt no restraint in <b>this</b> <b>stranger's</b> company. Indeed, she was conscious of a pleasant sense of camaraderie, which seemed the best name for it, though she had hired him to drive her to Mrs. Hunter's and was very uncertain as to whether she could pay him.|$|R
6000|$|The father {{paused a}} moment, then withdrew [...] His weapon, and {{replaced}} it; but stood still, [...] And looking on her, as to look her through, [...] 'Not I,' he said, 'have sought <b>this</b> <b>stranger's</b> ill; [...] Not I {{have made this}} desolation: few [...] Would bear such outrage, and forbear to kill; [...] But I must do my duty--how thou hast [...] Done thine, the present vouches for the past.|$|R
60|$|I was {{speaking}} wiselier than I knew. He turned sharply, {{and by a}} play of light it seemed that at one of them there stood looking down on {{us out of the}} distance a shape that so had watched for ever, leering darkly out of the void. And there awoke in me the sense of <b>this</b> <b>stranger's</b> extremity of solitude, of his unhappy disguise, of his animal-like patience.|$|R

60|$|Aca. Darest thou, who didst thy prince's life betray, Once {{name that}} duty, thou hast thrown away? Like thy {{injustice}} to <b>this</b> <b>stranger</b> shown, To tax {{him with a}} guilt, that is thy own?-- Can you, brave soldiers, suffer him to die, That gave you life, in giving victory? Look but upon <b>this</b> <b>stranger,</b> see those hands, That brought you freedom, fettered up in bands. Not one looks up,-- Lest sudden pity should their hearts surprise, And steal into their bosoms through their eyes.|$|E
