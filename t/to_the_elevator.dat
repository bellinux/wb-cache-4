5|$|Unarmed at first, Hawkins {{entered the}} south {{entrance}} of the Von Maur department store at about 1:36p.m. CST (19:36 UTC). After walking a short distance into the store, he scanned the area, turned around and left. Returning six minutes later through the same entrance, he proceeded directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> at his immediate right, {{this time with a}} Century WASR-10 (a commercial copy of the AKM (7.62×39mm) semi-automatic rifle) stolen from his stepfather's house, along with two 30-round magazines taped together, concealed in a sweatshirt. He took the elevator to the top floor.|$|E
5|$|The two {{restaurant}} owners {{meet with}} Derrick, {{who does not}} react politely to them. However, they decide not to turn in Derrick. The husband/father has an awakening about Amira as well and forgives her, turning in Nasir to the police for an expired visa. At Parker’s party, Mac (Tina Majorino) reconnects with Max (Adam Rose), and Veronica shows mild jealousy when Piz shows her his new fling. Logan gets Parker a romantic cake. In order to escape from an awkward suitor whom Logan introduces her to, Veronica asks Piz {{to pretend to be}} her boyfriend. Afterwards, Wallace informs her that Piz does have a crush on her. Veronica realizes that she has not realized this because of her preoccupation with her breakup with Logan. She talks to Piz on the porch at the party, and he suddenly kisses her. Piz retreats <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> but Veronica appears and kisses him back. The elevator opens, revealing Logan.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in the newspaper Fremover (Narvik, Norway), in May 1994, the English aviation engineer Hugh Tyrer stated that the cause of the accident was probably due to fatigue in the end piece of the transfer mechanism <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator.</b> The end piece was in such a state that it would have failed sooner or later in ordinary use. Following this discovery in the wreck, Widerøe had grounded all their Twin Otters and checked these pieces, but without finding any other defect parts. de Havilland Canada had also sent an alert to all operators of the Twin Otter to check the component, and had canceled the contract with the subcontractor. On 800 operating Twin Otters, 86 end pieces were replaced shortly after the accident, although none had fatigue similar to that of LN-BNS. The commission's chair, Ragnar Rygnestad, stated that they had not considered the end piece {{to be part of the}} cause of the accident, and that they therefore had not stress-tested it or the elevator to see what forces were needed to cause a crack. Rygnestad stated that the board knew about the fatigue. He also said that he had no problems with the opening of a new inquiry. Widerøe stated that they trusted the report from the Accident Investigation Board.|$|E

25|$|On September 5, 1957, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) began {{allowing}} free {{public access}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> at <b>the</b> 181st and 190th Street stations. Though <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> were intended for subway riders, local residents paid <b>the</b> subway fare <b>to</b> avoid climbing about eight stories up Fort Washington Hill. Bills were {{proposed in the}} New York State Legislature <b>to</b> put <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> out of fare control, but these failed in committee. The NYCTA agreed once Joseph Zaretzki, the local State Senator, requested the change.|$|R

25|$|For {{these ideas}} to apply, {{everything}} {{observed in the}} frame has {{to be subject to}} a base-line, common acceleration shared by the frame itself. That situation would apply, for example, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> example, where all objects are subject to the same gravitational acceleration, and the elevator itself accelerates at the same rate.|$|E

25|$|According to Mason, the {{controls}} of the Vampire {{were considered to be}} relatively light and sensitive, employing an effective elevator arrangement that enabled generous acceleration from relatively little control inputs along with highly balanced ailerons that could achieve high rates of roll. In comparison <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> and ailerons, the rudder required more vigorous actuation in order to achieve meaningful effect. Pilots converting from piston-engined types would find themselves having to adapt to the slower acceleration of turbojet engines and the corresponding need to moderate rapid throttle movements to avoid instigating a compressor stall.|$|E
25|$|On the {{top floor}} is a kiosk and lookout, with {{panoramic}} views of the city, while connections to the floors below are made (in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator)</b> by two spiral staircases, with different patterns on each storey. The main machinery was installed {{at the base of}} the Elevator, while at the exit to the Largo do Carmo there is a veranda to allow circulation. The corridor that passes above the structure, was transformed into a terrace, and exits to Largo do Carmo through an iron gate. The space destined the electrical equipment was located under the Escadinhas, in a space set aside for this purpose, under a vaulted ceiling.|$|E
25|$|The temple {{occupies}} {{parts of}} the first floor {{and all of the}} fourth, fifth, and sixth floors of the building. The interiors of these floors were completely renovated. The walls were soundproofed so traffic noise would not interrupt temple patrons. The total floor area for the temple part of the building is , with two progressive ordinance rooms and two sealing rooms. Unlike many of the smaller temples built since the pilot program, the ordinance rooms are perpendicular to each other to adapt to the size limitations of the building. The cornerstone containing the year of dedication, commonly found on the outside facade of most temples, is located in the interior lobby next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> which leads to the chapel portion of the building. Inside the temple, beehives are carved into the molding, and door handles that look like the Statue of Liberty torch are found throughout. Paintings on the walls of many of the rooms depict scenes from nature.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The goal of {{this project}} was <b>to</b> design <b>the</b> vision system onboard a PR 2 robot tasked with {{navigating}} between floors in the ICICS X-Wing at UBC. The vision task includes the detection and localization of elevator buttons that must be pressed in order <b>to</b> ride <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> a desired floor. The system is implemented in ROS, the Robotic Operating System from Willow Garage, and executed on the PR 2. OpenCV and Template Matching are used <b>to</b> detect <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> buttons while stereo enhanced by a projected textured light display is used <b>to</b> localize <b>the</b> robot with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> detected <b>elevator</b> buttons. 1...|$|R

25|$|It {{is alleged}} {{sometime}} around or after 4pm, 19-year-old Dick Rowland, a black shoeshiner employed at a Main Street shine parlor, entered the only elevator {{of the nearby}} Drexel Building, at 319 South Main Street, to use the top-floor restroom, which was restricted to blacks. He encountered Sarah Page, the 17-year-old white elevator operator who was on duty. The two likely knew each other at least by sight, as this building {{was the only one}} nearby with a restroom which Rowland had express permission to use, and the elevator operated by Page {{was the only one in}} the building. A clerk at Renberg's, a clothing store located on the first floor of the Drexel, heard what sounded like a woman's scream and saw a young black man rushing from the building. The clerk went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> and found Page in what he said was a distraught state. Thinking she had been assaulted, he summoned the authorities.|$|E

500|$|The {{remaining}} members opt {{to climb up}} the elevator shaft {{at the risk of}} destabilizing the pool. In the process, Janice loses her grip and falls into the shark-infested water. Despite Carter's attempts to save her, the shark ultimately kills her. In the facility's kitchen, which has been partially flooded, cook Sherman [...] "Preacher" [...] Dudley manages to kill the first shark with an explosion. He then makes his way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> shaft, where he encounters Carter, Tom and Susan. Carter and Tom go to the flooded laboratory to activate a control panel that drains a stairway to the surface, while Susan heads to her room to collect her research material. Carter and Tom reach the control panel, but the largest shark ultimately kills Tom and destroys the controls. In her room, Susan is ambushed by another shark, but manages to kill it with a power cable, destroying her research in the process.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} the cast {{is trying to}} get back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> after hooking up actor Stellan Skarsgård to the {{helicopter}} is actually an accident that made it into the finished film. As Jackson explained, [...] "At one point three tons of water got thrown on us by accident and we got swept toward those cargo bays and everyone thought we were going into the drink and people were tumbling around this metal grating [...] We scrambled up and kept acting [...] That was not supposed to happen and we didn't have safety harnesses on and we were flailing around on this deck." [...] Jackson was initially offered the role played by LL Cool J, but his management team did not like the idea of him playing a chef, so Harlin created the role of Russell Franklin for him. Additionally, LL Cool J's character was supposed to die early on, but the director ultimately decided to keep him. The production team could not afford to have a fully trained parrot for LL Cool J's character, so they used two parrots: one that was good at flying, and another that could sit on his shoulder.|$|E
50|$|Phase one mode is {{activated}} by a corresponding smoke sensor or heat sensor in the building. Once an alarm has been activated, <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> will automatically go into phase one. <b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> will wait {{an amount of}} time, then proceed to go into nudging mode <b>to</b> tell everyone <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> is leaving <b>the</b> floor. Once <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> has left <b>the</b> floor, depending on where the alarm was set off, <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> will go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fire-recall floor. However, if the alarm was activated on the fire-recall floor, <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> will have an alternate floor to recall <b>to.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> is recalled, it proceeds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recall floor and stops with its doors open. <b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> will no longer respond to calls or move in any direction. Located on the fire-recall floor is a fire-service key switch. The fire-service key switch has <b>the</b> ability <b>to</b> turn fire service off, turn fire service on or to bypass fire service. <b>The</b> only way <b>to</b> return <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> normal service is to switch it <b>to</b> bypass after <b>the</b> alarms have reset.|$|R
