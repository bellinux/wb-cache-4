5|$|Fluor {{was founded}} in 1912 by John Simon Fluor as Fluor Construction Company. It grew quickly, {{predominantly}} by building oil refineries, pipelines and other facilities for <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas industry, at first in California, {{and then in the}} Middle East and globally. In the late 1960s, it began diversifying into oil drilling, coal mining and other raw materials like lead. A global recession in <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas industry and losses from its mining operation led to restructuring and layoffs in the 1980s. Fluor sold its oil operations and diversified its construction work into a broader range of services and industries.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium reacts violently {{with water}} and can cause fires. To ensure safety and purity, this metal is usually kept under a dry mineral oil or sealed in glass {{ampoules}} in an inert atmosphere. Rubidium forms peroxides on exposure even to small amount of air diffused into <b>the</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>and</b> storage is subject to similar precautions as the storage of metallic potassium.|$|E

5|$|Hartmann {{said the}} German pilots {{themselves}} still learned from their enemy. Oil freezing in the DB 605 engines of the Bf109G-6s made them difficult {{to start in}} the extreme cold of the Russian winter. A captured Soviet airman showed them how pouring fuel into the aircraft's oil sump would thaw <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> enable the engine to start on the first try. Another solution, also learned from the Soviets, was to ignite fuel under the engine.|$|E

5|$|Noise {{pollution}} from anthropogenic activities is another major concern for marine mammals. This {{is a problem}} because underwater noise pollution interferes with the abilities of some marine mammals to communicate, and locate both predators and prey. Underwater explosions are used {{for a variety of}} purposes including military activities, construction and oceanographic or geophysical research. They can cause injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs, and contusion and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract. Underwater noise is generated from shipping, <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas industry, research, and military use of sonar and oceanographic acoustic experimentation. Acoustic harassment devices and acoustic deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away marine mammals emit loud and noxious underwater sounds.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} developments in Texan government resulted from the creation of a state oil production tax in 1905. The revenue generated by the tax made funds available for development in the state without the need for income taxes and similar revenue mechanisms adopted in other states. In 1919, tax revenue from oil production surpassed $1 million ($ in today's terms) and in 1929 it reached $6 million ($ in today's terms). By 1940, <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas industry accounted for approximately half of all taxes paid in the state.|$|E

5|$|The Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources is {{responsible}} for general strategy in <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas sectors and for monitoring the state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco. The oil, gas and refining industries in Saudi Arabia are controlled by law by Saudi Aramco, which has a near monopoly in these areas.

However, in 2003, the law was changed to allow foreign companies to look for Saudi Arabia's vast reserves of natural gas, believed to represent 4% of the world's reserves. This was the first time since the 1970s that foreign companies have been permitted to search for oil or gas.|$|E
