25|$|Throughout its existence, {{the college}} {{remained}} a study house for clergy with a conservative theological ethos. The main exponent of <b>this</b> <b>thinking</b> is probably John Fisher, {{who served as}} Master between 1497 and 1505. As Chancellor of the university, Fisher {{was instrumental in the}} foundation of St John's and Christ's. As Bishop of Rochester he maintained the conservative stance on the royal supremacy and the reformation measures of king Henry VIII shared by much of the Michaelhouse fellowship which, more prominent and vociferous in his case, ultimately led to Fisher's execution in 1535.|$|E
25|$|One {{concern of}} the pilots was that no {{airfield}} then in existence, in their view, could safely take an eight-ton aircraft. They also objected {{to the use of}} Hornet engines, because most pilots were accustomed to the less-powerful Wasps and would find Hornets overpowering. Pratt & Whitney's chief engineer, George Mead, knew that <b>this</b> <b>thinking</b> was misguided and that within a few years it would seem antiquated. P's president, Frederick Rentschler, faced with a tough decision, decided to acquiesce to the airline pilots' unanimous demand. The decision created a rift between Mead and Rentschler. Despite the bitter disagreements on design and engines, the 247 was still a remarkable achievement and was Boeing's showcase exhibit at the 1933 Chicago World's Fair.|$|E

Taking the surreal English humour of Monty Python as an influence, he began to write a piece that would combine complex music with a sense of humour, with the idea it would poke light-hearted fun at the band, the audience, and the music critics. He also intended to satirise the progressive rock genre that was popular at the time.|$|E

500|$|Southampton {{failed to}} win {{promotion}} during the 1947–48 season, finishing third behind Birmingham City and Newcastle United, {{but it was still}} a successful campaign for them and by its end Ramsey had become one of the club's main players, taking on the captain's role on occasion. In May 1948 he was selected as part of a 16-man England squad to tour Switzerland and Italy; the flight to Geneva was his first time in an aeroplane. On his return from international duty he flew to São Paulo to join the rest of the Southampton team on a club tour of Brazil. Southampton had lost every game in Brazil so far, and spirits were low. Ramsey restored morale and contributed to a new plan to counter the Brazilian tactics, which were much more fluid than those favoured by English teams of the time. Ramsey suggested that Southampton could use long diagonal passes to exploit the gaps the Brazilian defenders left behind them as they ran upfield to attack. McKinstry notes the similarity of <b>this</b> <b>thinking</b> to some of the tactics Ramsey later used as manager of Ipswich Town. Southampton beat Corinthians 2–1 in their next game before ending the tour with a draw and a defeat. Ramsey was impressed by the South Americans' footballing ability, but not by the conduct of their players, pressmen, administrators or fans; McKinstry considers the experience to have [...] "fed Alf's nascent xenophobia".|$|E
500|$|Historiography of Żydokomuna remains controversial. Works such {{as those}} by Jan T. Gross have {{polarized}} debate over anti-Jewish violence in Poland, with Gross and his supporters characterizing Żydokomuna as an antisemitic cliché while {{to some of his}} critics Żydokomuna was a fact of history. According to Gross's supporters, the strength of the Żydokomuna belief stemmed from age-old Polish fears of Russia and from anti-communist and antisemitic attitudes. Schatz writes that [...] "because antisemitism {{was one of the main}} forces that drew Jews to the Communist movement, Żydokomuna meant turning the effects of antisemitism into a cause of its further increase." [...] Żydokomuna boosted antisemitism by amplifying ideas about an alleged [...] "Jewish world conspiracy." [...] According to <b>this</b> <b>thinking,</b> Bolshevism and communism became [...] "the modern means to the long-attempted Jewish political conquest of Poland; the Żydokomuna conspirators would finally succeed in establishing a 'Judeo-Polonia.'" [...] Subscribers to this theory maintain that there was a strong tradition of antisemitism which provided a base for Żydokomuna to feed upon. These sources claim that many Poles likely exaggerated Jewish participation in the Soviet occupation because a Jewish presence in the government apparatus was a novel phenomenon in pre-war Poland. Critics of these sources, such as Niall Ferguson, claim that much of the anti-Jewish sentiment was justified due to the disproportionate influence of Jewish communists in carrying out Soviet policies. According to Ferguson, [...] "The entire Polish population adopted a negative attitude towards the Jews because of their blatant cooperation with the Bolsheviks and their hostility against non-Jews." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some economists {{believe that}} Standard Oil {{was not a}} monopoly, and also argue that the intense free market {{competition}} resulted in cheaper oil prices and more diverse petroleum products. Critics claimed that success in meeting consumer needs was driving other companies {{out of the market}} who were not as successful. An example of <b>this</b> <b>thinking</b> was given in 1890 when Rep. William Mason, arguing in favor of the Sherman Antitrust Act, said: [...] "trusts have made products cheaper, have reduced prices; but if the price of oil, for instance, were reduced to one cent a barrel, it would not right the wrong done to people of this country by the trusts which have destroyed legitimate competition and driven honest men from legitimate business enterprise".|$|E
2500|$|In {{line with}} <b>this</b> <b>thinking,</b> recent {{scholarship}} {{has tended to}} look at the play as being a more complete dramatic text, rather than a series of battle scenes loosely strung together with a flimsy narrative. Certain modern productions in particular have done much to bring about this re-evaluation (such as Peter Hall's and John Barton's in 1963 and 1964, Terry Hands' in 1977, Michael Bogdanov's in 1986, Adrian Nobles' in 1988, Katie Mitchell's in 1994, Edward Hall's in 2000 and Michael Boyd's in 2000 and 2006). Based upon this revised way of thinking, and looking at the play as more complex than has traditionally been allowed for, some critics now argue that the play [...] "juxtaposes the stirring aesthetic appeal of martial action with discursive reflection on the political causes and social consequences." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{classical}} descriptions, {{an equivalent}} description of this mental faculty is eikasia, {{in the philosophy}} of Plato. This is the ability to perceive whether a perception is an image of something else, related somehow but not the same, and therefore allows humans to perceive that a dream or memory or a reflection in a mirror is not reality as such. What Klein refers to as dianoetic eikasia is the eikasia concerned specifically with thinking and mental images, such as those mental symbols, icons, signes, and marks discussed above as definitive of reason. Explaining reason from this direction: human thinking is special in the way that we often understand visible things as if they were themselves images of our intelligible [...] "objects of thought" [...] as [...] "foundations" [...] (hypothēses in Ancient Greek). <b>This</b> <b>thinking</b> (dianoia) is [...] "...an activity which consists in making the vast and diffuse jungle of the visible world depend on a plurality of more 'precise' noēta." ...|$|E

They donated a large amount of money and promised more if a spectacular action could be done in Vietnam against the French. The comrades attempted an action but failed completely, wasting all the money. After his release, Phan travelled to Beijing and to Japan, and then to various parts of China trying to get back into Vietnam. When he eventually got to the border of Yunnan Province and Vietnam, he discovered that World War I was over and his plans of using it to help defeat the French were hopeless. Phan wandered around China for years after this without accomplishing anything significant. He pondered collaborating with the French, who were now ruled by the Socialist Party (France), and he wrote a booklet about why collaboration with the French would be good. He later changed his mind and blamed <b>this</b> <b>thinking</b> on Phan Ba Ngoc, who was assassinated by one of Phan's supporters for being a collaborator with the French.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{theory is}} that Joan is {{actually}} a comic figure, and the huge alterations in her character are supposed to evoke laughter. Michael Taylor, for example, argues, [...] "A fiendish provenance replaces a divine one in , a scene that reduces Joan to a comic, bathetic dependency on shifty representatives of the underworld." [...] In line with <b>this</b> <b>thinking,</b> it is worth pointing {{out that in the}} 1981 BBC Television Shakespeare adaptation, Joan, and the French in general, are treated predominantly as comic figures. Joan (Brenda Blethyn), Alençon (Michael Byrne), the Bastard (Brian Protheroe), Reignier (David Daker) and Charles (Ian Saynor) are treated as buffoons for the most part, and there is no indication of any malevolence (significantly, when Joan’s fiends abandon her, we never see them, we simply see her talking to empty air). Examples of the comic treatment of the characters are found during the battle of Orléans, where Joan is ludicrously depicted as defending the city from the entire English army single-handed, whilst Talbot stands by incredulously watching his soldiers flee one after another. Another example appears in Act 2, Scene 1, as the five of them blame one another for the breach in the watch at Orléans that allowed the English back into the city. Their role as comic figures is also shown in Act 3, Scene 2. After Joan has entered Rouen and the others stand outside waiting for her signal. Charles is shown sneaking through a field holding a helmet with a large plume up {{in front of his face}} in an effort to hide.|$|E
2500|$|Black {{concluded}} that the Illinois Constitution's requirement was essentially a [...] "test oath," [...] an oath designed to test one's loyalty before any illegal act had actually occurred. [...] But, relying on Cummings v. Missouri, 71 U.S. 277 (1867) and Ex parte Garland, 71 U.S. 333 (1866), Black said that test oaths were anathema to the Constitution. [...] "This feeling was made manifest in Article VI of the Constitution, which provides that 'no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.'" [...] Illinois {{has the power to}} draft its citizens, and to punish them for refusing to serve in its militia, Black said, but it does {{not have the right to}} assume beforehand that Summers would take the bar association oath in bad faith and fail to fulfill it at some indeterminate time in the future. <b>This</b> <b>thinking</b> had been rejected by Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in his dissent in United States v. Schwimmer, 279 U.S. 644 (1929), and by Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes in his dissent in United States v. Macintosh, 283 U.S. 605 (1931), and Black embraced their views. Finally, Black noted that Illinois had not imposed a draft since 1864 and that the majority was engaging in mere speculation about imposing one in the future. There was no violation of the oath, and no actual inability to uphold the state constitution, Black concluded. [...] "he probability that Illinois would ever call the petitioner to serve in a war has little more reality than an imaginary quantity in mathematics. I cannot agree that a state can lawfully bar from a semi-public position a well qualified man of good character solely because he entertains a religious belief which might prompt him at some time in the future to violate a law which has not yet been and may never be enacted." ...|$|E
