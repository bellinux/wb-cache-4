5|$|American {{intelligence}} analysts were quite baffled by {{this series of}} enemy actions. For them {{there appeared to be}} no logic behind the sustained NVA/NLF offensives, other than to inflict casualties on the allied forces. This they accomplished, but the casualties absorbed by the North Vietnamese seemed to negate any direct gains they might have obtained. The border battles did, however, have <b>two</b> <b>significant</b> consequences that were unappreciated at the time—they fixed the attention of the American command on the border regions and they drew American and ARVN forces away from the coastal lowlands and cities, in preparation for the Tet Offensive.|$|E
5|$|St Mary's church houses {{recreation}}s of <b>two</b> <b>significant</b> artworks, both donated in 1857 by Lady Clara Dry. The {{first is}} a recreation of Guido Reni's 1610 altarpiece from the Quirinal Palace, Rome. The second a 19th-century copy of Raphael's Transfiguration. Both were purchased in Italy during the Dry's honeymoon, and were restored in 2004. It also contains a copy of Bartolomé Esteban Murillo's Crucifixion in the East windowa gift from Lady Dry {{and a copy of}} Raphael's Annunciation. The Nave houses an organ built in 1861 by J. W.

5|$|The {{discovery}} that the comet {{was likely to}} collide with Jupiter caused great excitement within the astronomical community and beyond, as astronomers had never before seen <b>two</b> <b>significant</b> Solar System bodies collide. Intense studies of the comet were undertaken, and as its orbit became more accurately established, {{the possibility of a}} collision became a certainty. The collision would provide a unique opportunity for scientists to look inside Jupiter's atmosphere, as the collisions were expected to cause eruptions of material from the layers normally hidden beneath the clouds.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} type of tower {{used was}} a massive self-supporting delta pylon, or waist pylon, which consumed 21 tonnes of steel per kilometre of line. This type of pylon {{was used for the}} first 735kV power line from the Manic-Outardes power stations to the load centre of Montreal. There are <b>two</b> <b>significant</b> variations of the delta pylon; one has longer side crossbars such that all three bundles of conductors are suspended on V-shaped insulators. The other has shorter side crossbars, such that the two outside bundles are hung on a vertical insulator string and only the middle bundle is hung with a V-shaped insulator.|$|E
5|$|The {{planetary}} {{model of}} the atom had <b>two</b> <b>significant</b> shortcomings. The first is that, unlike planets orbiting a sun, electrons are charged particles. An accelerating electric charge is known to emit electromagnetic waves according to the Larmor formula in classical electromagnetism. An orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward the nucleus, colliding with it in {{a small fraction of}} a second. The second problem was that the planetary model could not explain the highly peaked emission and absorption spectra of atoms that were observed.|$|E

5|$|A {{nobelium}} atom has 102 electrons, {{of which}} three {{can act as}} valence electrons. They {{are expected to be}} arranged in the configuration 5f147s2 (ground state term symbol 1S0), although experimental verification of this electron configuration had not yet been made as of 2006. In forming compounds, all the three valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind a 5f13 core: this conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. Nevertheless, {{it is more likely that}} only two valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind a stable 5f14 core with a filled 5f14 shell. The first ionization potential of nobelium was measured to be at most (6.65±0.07)eV in 1974, based on the assumption that the 7s electrons would ionize before the 5f ones; this value has since not yet been refined further due to nobelium's scarcity and high radioactivity. The ionic radius of hexacoordinate and octacoordinate No3+ had been preliminarily estimated in 1978 to be around 90 and 102pm respectively; the ionic radius of No2+ has been experimentally found to be 100pm to <b>two</b> <b>significant</b> figures. The enthalpy of hydration of No2+ has been calculated as 1486kJ·mol−1.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{game in the}} 2004 {{season in}} which Favre and the Packers {{finished}} 10–6 was against the New York Giants. During the game, Favre suffered a concussion. He did not receive medical clearance to re-enter the game. Despite the concussion, Favre threw a 28-yard touchdown to Javon Walker on a fourth down play. Afterwards {{it was reported that}} Favre did not remember throwing the touchdown pass. Favre also had <b>two</b> <b>significant</b> touchdown streaks of note during the season. He had completed at least one touchdown pass in 36 consecutive games over the 2002–2004 seasons which at the time was the second longest streak in NFL history. Also, during the 2004 post-season, he broke Dan Marino's record for consecutive games with at least one touchdown pass in the post season. Favre went on to throw a touchdown pass in twenty consecutive playoff games which is still an NFL record.|$|E
5|$|A {{scientist}} with a PhD in plant physiology, Marshall became independently wealthy {{after the death}} of his father in 1929. He had started his outdoor career in 1925 as forester with the U.S. Forest Service. He used his financial independence for expeditions to Alaska and other wilderness areas. Later he held <b>two</b> <b>significant</b> public appointed posts: chief of forestry in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, from 1933 to 1937, and head of recreation management in the Forest Service, from 1937 to 1939, both during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During this period, he directed the promulgation of regulations to preserve large areas of roadless land that were under federal management. Many years after his death, some of those areas were permanently protected from development, exploitation, and mechanization with the passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the short}} line to Chesham {{generally}} {{had a good}} safety record, despite its sharp curves and relatively steep gradient, it suffered <b>two</b> <b>significant</b> accidents in this period. On 19August 1909 the Aclass engine hauling the 7.53am train from Chesham broke an axle and derailed outside Chesham. There were no injuries but the track was blocked; a passenger service was maintained by operating shuttle services from {{each end of the}} branch to the crash site, where passengers were obliged to walk around the derailed engine to change trains. On 6November 1909 a backdraught from a locomotive firebox enveloped Robert Prior, the train's driver, in flames. (The type of locomotive is not recorded, but it is likely to have been a Metropolitan Railway D Class, which are known to have had a problem with backdraughts.) The locomotive's fireman managed to drive the train to Chesham, where Prior died from his injuries two days later. An inquest found that Prior had failed to turn on the blower, and a verdict of accidental death was recorded.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocines have {{highly unusual}} teeth {{compared}} to other sauropods. The crowns are long and slender, and elliptical in cross-section, while the apex forms a blunt, triangular point. The most prominent wear facet is on the apex, though unlike all other wear patterns observed within sauropods, diplodocine wear patterns are on the labial (cheek) side of both {{the upper and lower}} teeth. What this means is that Diplodocus and other diplodocids had a radically different feeding mechanism than other sauropods. Unilateral branch stripping is the most likely feeding behavior of Diplodocus, as it explains the unusual wear patterns of the teeth (coming from tooth–food contact). In unilateral branch stripping, one tooth row would have been used to strip foliage from the stem, while the other would act as a guide and stabilizer. With the elongated preorbital (in front of the eyes) region of the skull, longer portions of stems could be stripped in a single action. Also, the palinal (backwards) motion of the lower jaws could have contributed <b>two</b> <b>significant</b> roles to feeding behaviour: 1) an increased gape, and 2) allowed fine adjustments of the relative positions of the tooth rows, creating a smooth stripping action.|$|E
5|$|Every {{player has}} {{a limit to}} the number of units they can create—a {{population}} limit—but may not immediately use the entire potential population. The population capacity, which can be capped at anywhere between 75 – 200 in intervals of 25, is {{based on the number of}} houses, Castles, or Town Centers—the main building in a player's town—which have been built. The Age of Kings introduced <b>two</b> <b>significant</b> new features for unit management: the idle villager button, which helps players identify villagers that have not been assigned a task, and the town bell, which sends all a player's villagers into their Town Center, Castle, or tower for safety; units garrisoned within these three buildings, especially archers, increase the building's firepower (towers fire more arrows with units garrisoned inside) including the town center, which cannot fire anything at all without someone garrisoned there.|$|E

5|$|Holmes {{spent the}} next five years {{gathering}} supporters for his grassroots movement, traveling at his own expense to gather petition signatures from across the state. On January 14, 1855, Holmes went to the state capital of Lansing to lobby the legislature for an agricultural college. He {{spent the next}} four weeks championing the bill he wrote and cementing support in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Though many legislators supported the basic concept of a state-funded agricultural college, there was strong opposition from University of Michigan president Henry Tappan, who wanted the agriculture program to be part of his school. Nevertheless, Holmes prevailed. On February 12, 1855, Michigan Governor Kinsley S. Bingham signed Act 130, establishing the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan, the school that would become Michigan State University. The final draft of the bill held only <b>two</b> <b>significant</b> differences from the one that Holmes presented: that the purchase price not exceed US $15 per acre, rather than the $25 Holmes desired; and that the site must be within ten miles (16km) of Lansing, a provision added to silence the various factions that wanted the new college built in their own backyards.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Manuel Azaña Díaz and Indalecio Prieto {{worked to}} unify the left and combat its extreme {{elements}} in {{what would become the}} Popular Front; this included staging of large, popular rallies,. Lerroux's Radical government collapsed after <b>two</b> <b>significant</b> scandals, including the Straperlo affair. However, president Niceto Alcalá Zamora did not allow the CEDA to form a government, and called elections. Zamora had become disenchanted with Robles's obvious desire {{to do away with the}} republic and establish a corporate state, and his air of pride. He was looking to strengthen a new center party in place of the Radicals, but the election system did not favour this. Manuel Portela Valladares was thus chosen to form a caretaker government in the meantime. The Republic had, as its opponents pointed out, faced twenty-six separate government crises. Portela failed to get the required support in the parliament to rule as a majority. The government was dissolved on 4 January; the date for elections would be 16 February.|$|E

The New IRA declared that all criminals were legitimate targets after Alan Ryan's brother, Vincent Ryan, was shot dead. In April 2016, the New IRA were blamed for badly injuring {{a man in a}} punishment shooting in Derry, shortly after a man had been killed by a dissident Republican attack in Ardoyne. In May 2016 three men were shot in paramilitary style attacks in republican areas of Belfast during a 24-hour period, leaving two injured and one dead. On 25 April a New IRA member, Michael Barr was shot dead in west Dublin. Gardaí suspected Barr was shot dead because it was believed by the Kinahan cartel he provided a “safe house” to one of the gunmen in the Regency Hotel attack. Fifteen people were arrested in Northern Ireland following a paramilitary funeral for him.|$|E
