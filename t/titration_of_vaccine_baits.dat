40|$|In Europe, the {{elimination}} of wildlife rabies using oral rabies vaccination [ORV] of foxes for more than 30 years has been a success story. Since a comprehensive review on {{the scope of the}} different oral rabies <b>vaccine</b> <b>baits</b> distributed across Europe has not been available yet, we evaluated the use <b>of</b> different <b>vaccine</b> <b>baits</b> over the entire period of ORV [1978 - 2014]. Our findings provide valuable insights into the complexity of ORV programs in terms <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> related issues. More than 10 oral vaccines against rabies were used over the past four decades. Depending on many factors, the extent to which oral rabies virus vaccines were used varied considerably resulting in huge differences in the number <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> doses disseminated in ORV campaigns as well as in large spatial and temporal overlaps. Although vaccine virus strains derived from the SAD rabies virus isolate were the most widely used, the success of ORV campaigns in Europe cannot be assigned to a single oral rabies virus vaccine alone.

40|$|Ten {{geographic}} {{cells of}} rabies cases were identified within southern Ontario. Some had regular 3 -year peaks, whereas others had weak cycles with mean periods {{of up to}} 9 years. Incidence of rabies was related to soil types (highest on sandy and clay loams), land use (abundant where hay and pasture were dominant), and drainage (poor drainage supported only low levels of rabies). A spatial stochastic simulation model {{is being used to}} evaluate risks and tactics associated with reduction of rabies by use <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> <b>baits.</b> The model indicated that persistence of rabies is unlikely in areas with < 4, 000 km 2 of contiguous fox habitat. In sensitivity tests the model was most affected by the values of four input parameters: rate of contact among foxes, incubation period of rabies, fox density, and a density-dependent feedback that reduces fox recruitment when density approaches or exceeds a predetermined "carrying capacity. " In a majority of model experiments, a sin-gle vaccination of 60 % of a fox population eradicated rabies, but only if vaccination took place just after a rabies outbreak, when the number of both foxes and rabid animals was reduced.

40|$|After {{more than}} 10  years of absence, sylvatic rabies re-appeared in Italy in 2008. To prevent disease spread, three oral rabies {{vaccination}} (ORV) campaigns targeting red foxes were performed through manual distribution <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> <b>baits</b> between January and September 2009. As these campaigns proved unsuccessful, {{at the end}} of December 2009, baits started being distributed using helicopters, allowing uniform coverage of larger areas in a shorter time period. From winter 2009 to autumn 2016, a total of 15 ORV campaigns (four emergency, four regular and seven preventive ORV) were implemented through aerial distribution of baits. In this study, we assessed the costs of the aerial ORV campaigns, which were aimed at eradicating the disease and reobtaining the rabies-free status. Cumulative costs per km(2) were estimated at € 59. 45 during emergency campaigns and ranged between € 51. 94 and € 65. 67 in the regular vaccinations. The main portion of costs for ORV programmes were related to baits supply and distribution: € 49. 24 (82. 83 %) in emergency campaigns and from € 40. 33 to € 43. 35 in regular ORVs (71. 97 % and 66. 02 %, respectively). At the end of each ORV campaign, the efficacy of vaccination activities was estimated by assessing the proportion of foxes testing positive for tetracycline biomarker in jawbone, indicating bait intake. Results revealed that the proportion of foxes that ingested baits varied between 70. 97 % and 95. 51 %. Statistical analysis indicated that reducing the density of dropped baits could potentially lead to a cost-saving of 22. 81 %, still maintaining a satisfactory level of bait intake by the fox population...|$|R
40|$|To improve both {{safety and}} {{stability}} <b>of</b> the oral <b>vaccines</b> {{used in the}} field to vaccinate foxes against rabies, a recombinant vaccinia virus, which expresses the immunizing G protein of rabies virus has been developed by inserting the cDNA which codes for the immunogenic glycoprotein of rabies virus into the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of the Copenhagen strain of vaccinia virus. The efficacy <b>of</b> this <b>vaccine</b> was tested by the oral route, primarily in foxes. The immunity conferred, a minimum of 12 months in cubs and 18 months in adult animals, corresponds to the duration of the protection required for vaccination of foxes in the field. Innocuity was tested in foxes, domestic animals, and in numerous European wild animal species that could compete with the red fox for the <b>vaccine</b> <b>bait.</b> No clinical signs or lesions were observed in any of the vaccinated animals during a minimum of 28 days post vaccination. Moreover, no transmission of immunizing doses of the recombinant occurred between foxes or other species tested.

40|$|AbstractWe {{formulate}} an S–I–R (Susceptible, Infected, Immune) spatiotemporal epidemic {{model as}} a system of coupled parabolic partial differential equations with no-flux boundary conditions. Immunity is gained through vaccination with the vaccine distribution considered a control variable. The objective is to characterize an optimal control, a vaccine program which minimizes the number of infected individuals and {{the costs associated with}} vaccination over a finite space and time domain. We prove existence of solutions to the state system and existence of an optimal control, as well as derive corresponding sensitivity and adjoint equations. Techniques of optimal control theory are then employed to obtain the optimal control characterization in terms of state and adjoint functions. To illustrate solutions, parameter values are chosen to model the spread of rabies in raccoons. Optimal distributions <b>of</b> oral rabies <b>vaccine</b> <b>baits</b> for homogeneous and heterogeneous spatial domains are compared. Numerical results reveal that natural land features affecting raccoon movement and the relocation of raccoons by humans can considerably alter the design of a cost-effective vaccination regime.

40|$|The small Indian {{mongoose}} (Herpestes auropunctatus) is an {{invasive species}} and rabies reservoir in Puerto Rico. In the continental United States, terrestrial wildlife rabies is primarily {{managed by the}} National Rabies Management Program (NRMP) of the United States Department of Agriculture through oral rabies vaccination (ORV); the distribution <b>of</b> the <b>vaccine</b> <b>baits</b> {{is influenced by the}} population density of the target species. TheNRMPuses a density index for estimating raccoon (Procyon lotor) population density to guide bait distribution. In Puerto Rico, a wildlife rabies vaccination program does not exist and vaccination of domestic animals is limited and not compulsory. To acquire information on density and other population dynamics, we compared a mongoose density index (MDI) adapted from the NRMP raccoon density index (RDI) to 3 other methods (2 types of capture–mark–recapture [CAPTURE and MARK] and spatially explicit capture–recapture [SECR]) for estimating density that incorporate modeling procedures on detection probabilities, and examined the spatial distribution of mongooses within our study plots. We used the RDI trapping protocol modified for mongooses to livetrap mongooses in El Yunque National Forest (El Yunque) and Cabo Rojo National Wildlife Refuge (Cabo Rojo) in fall of 2011 and spring of 2012 resulting in 4 trapping sessions. The MDI estimates were consistently less than those from other methods for estimating mongoose densities. The MDI detected a greater mongoose density during the wet season (0. 55 mongooses/ha) than the dry season (0. 34 mongooses/ha) at Cabo Rojo, consistent with all 3 other density estimation methods. Overall, the correlation coefficient between MDI and the other calculation methods was 3 ̆c 0. 68. When we examined known locations of mongooses and travel distances, we detected more mongooses in a smaller area within the study plot at Cabo Rojo than at El Yunque.

In 2003, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) began to quantify the impacts of skunk-variant rabies and to assess the feasibility of using oral rabies vaccination (ORV) as a containment measure. The CDPH rabies case data for skunks were spatially depicted and analyzed using a geographic information system. Statewide, rabid skunks (1992 – 2003) primarily occurred in seven physiographic regions: Central Coast, North Coast, North Sierra, Sacramento Valley, San Francisco Bay and Delta, San Joaquin Valley, and South Sierra. Detailed analysis of rabid skunks in San Luis Obispo (SLO) and Santa Barbara (SB) counties showed that skunk rabies was endemic in the coastal plain of SLO County between 1992 and 2000, but only became epizootic in SB County during 2002. Despite the widespread distribution of striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) throughout most of California, the skunk rabies variant has not been found in Los Angeles County since 1979.

In this paper, the author compares this pock-counting method with another method—titration by intravenous injection of chick embryos. He concludes that, although the reproducibility <b>of</b> <b>titrations</b> by intravenous injection compares very favourably with that obtained by chorio-allantoic inoculation, the former method would not be advantageous for the assay <b>of</b> <b>vaccines,</b> since it is very time-consuming and since differences in virulence might obscure comparisons between the efficacy <b>of</b> <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R

The reaction between antigen and antibody {{has been shown to}} be type specific, reproducible and relatively precise if the plaque technique is used for the <b>titration</b> <b>of</b> infective virus. Though the data available at present suggest that the antibody-combining capacity <b>of</b> a <b>vaccine</b> as titrated by this method parallels the antigenic activity measured in vivo, more information is necessary to give conclusive evidence on the relation between antigenic potencies titrated in vitro and in vivo...|$|R
