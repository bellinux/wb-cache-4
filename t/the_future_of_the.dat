5|$|All {{projections}} of <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe must {{account for the}} second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy, or a loss of the energy available to do work, must increase over time. Stars will eventually exhaust their supply of hydrogen fuel and burn out. Close encounters gravitationally fling planets from their star systems, and star systems from galaxies.|$|E

40|$|International audienceFor its own safety, a {{robot system}} should never find {{itself in a}} state where there is no {{feasible}} trajectory to avoid collision with an obstacle. Such a state is an Inevitable Collision State (ICS). The ICS concept is particularly useful for navigation in dynamic environments because it takes into account <b>the</b> <b>future</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moving objects. Accordingly it requires a model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment. In <b>the</b> real-world, <b>the</b> <b>future</b> trajectories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> obstacles are generally unknown and only estimates are available. This paper introduces a probabilistic formulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ICS concept which incorporates uncertainty in <b>the</b> model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> trajectories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> obstacles. It also presents two novel probabilistic ICSchecking algorithms that are compared with their deterministic counterpart...|$|R

NASA did not approve the requested $715 million, and <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Before {{observations}} of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios for <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe. If the mass {{density of the}} universe were greater than the critical density, then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state {{similar to that in}} which it started—a Big Crunch.|$|E
