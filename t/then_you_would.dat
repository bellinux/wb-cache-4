500|$|Cooper's meticulous {{planning}} {{may also}} have extended to the timing of his operation, and even his choice of attire, according to Kaye's research team. [...] "The FBI searched but couldn't find anyone who disappeared that weekend," [...] Kaye wrote, suggesting that the perpetrator may have returned to his normal occupation. [...] "If you were planning on going 'back to work on Monday', <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> need {{as much time as}} possible {{to get out of the}} woods, find transportation and get home. The very best time for this is in front of a four-day weekend, which is the timing Dan Cooper chose for his crime." [...] Furthermore, [...] "if he was planning ahead, he knew he had to hitchhike out of the woods, and it is much easier to get picked up in a suit and tie than in old blue jeans." ...|$|E
500|$|Manchester United manager Ferguson was {{critical}} {{of the performance of}} referee D'Urso: [...] "I felt sorry for the referee today, it doesn't matter how much training you have in any job. It's about temperament, and I just think the lad was too nervous for that today." [...] Despite losing their fourth consecutive Charity Shield match, Ferguson did not believe it would affect his team heading into the start of the season: [...] "We certainly hope we can go on to win the title again like we have in previous years. We just need to keep the standards up and show the desire we did in the second half." [...] He was also unsure whether Liverpool would be able to challenge for the Premier League: [...] "It's difficult to assess Liverpool at the moment. They started with confidence, but <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> expect that from a team that won three trophies a few months ago. You would also expect us to be sluggish at the start, because we are bloody good at it." ...|$|E

[...] "If NPR or any national organization had too much control or input into every station's local personality, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> lose {{the very thing that}} makes us what we are. So if Alan Chartock is what Albany and upstate New York created and what works for them, that's a beautiful thing, no matter what some outsiders might say." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{before her}} Hollyoaks entrance, a {{reporter}} for The Sun stated that Lynsey would be [...] "a hit with the boys", while putting other girls' noses out of joint. During {{an interview with a}} reporter from the show's official website, Hassan explained that Lynsey had been best friends with Cheryl for a long time. When Lynsey joined Cheryl in the village, she quickly found herself a job at the local hospital and fell in love. Hassan described Lynsey as being [...] "a very loyal person", who wanted to see the best in people and would do anything for her family and friends. Hassan tried to make her character's personality similar to her own, so she would be believable to the viewers. Hassan felt that on occasion Lynsey needed to stand up for herself, agreeing with the reporter who called her [...] "a bit of a push-over." [...] She later said that Lynsey should speak her true opinions more and stop being [...] "a soft touch". A new side to the character started to emerge when she began to grow a backbone and Hassan opined that Lynsey could [...] "hold her own". The actress commented to an OK! journalist that Lynsey was the typical girl next door, who could stand [...] "on her own two feet" [...] and speak what was on her mind. Hassan also thought that she had a very long fuse, but if it reached the end <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> see the spark in her.|$|E

60|$|GEOFFREY I know, dear. I was afraid. It mightn't {{have come}} off. And <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{have been so}} disappointed.|$|E

50|$|One of HP BASIC's more {{innovative}} features is built-in support for OpenVMS's powerful Record Management Services (RMS). Before VAX BASIC (as it was <b>then</b> called), <b>you</b> <b>would</b> only get native RMS support in DEC's COBOL compiler.|$|R
6000|$|... “Never mind explaining,” {{interrupted}} the other. “I daresay {{you could have}} been legally a Marshal of France and a Member of Parliament in England—and <b>then,</b> indeed, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have been of some use to our Embassy.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. And <b>then</b> perhaps <b>you</b> <b>would</b> get {{a chance}} to have a {{communication}} with the world of spirits. Surely the ghosts of seamen should haunt ships. Some of them would be sure to call on an old shipmate." ...|$|R

Irwine thinks so too. And Mr. Irwine is to have the chief authority on the estate--he has consented to undertake that. They will really be under no man but one whom they respect and like. It would be the same with you, Adam, and it could be nothing but a desire to give me worse pain that could incline you to go." ...|$|R
