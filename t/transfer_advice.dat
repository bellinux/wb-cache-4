We then transform that learned model into advice for a new task. A human teacher provides a mapping from the old task to the new task to guide this knowledge <b>transfer.</b> <b>Advice</b> is incorporated into our problem solver using a knowledge-based support vector regression method that we previously developed. This advice-taking approach allows the problem solver to refine or even discard the transferred knowledge based on its subsequent experiences. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with two games from the RoboCup soccer simulator: KeepAway and BreakAway. Our results demonstrate that a problem solver learning to play BreakAway using advice extracted from KeepAway outperforms a problem solver learning {{without the benefit of}} such advice. ...|$|E

The drivers of these changes are outlined, including the ever-increasing inputs to, and publications of, the intellectual property offices, especially those in East Asia, allied to the changed priorities of SME users of patent information, from relatively basic information to more sophisticated searches and advice in the business-related environment. The author then reports the current views of the European PATLIB network on their future priorities for services such as database searches, training of IP users, technology <b>transfer</b> <b>advice,</b> and networking with partners who can provide complementary services. Some initiatives within the EPO's policy for cooperation with member states are outlined, such as raising awareness and use of the patent system, patent information, and the exploitation of IP rights, especially amongst educational organisations and institutes and SMEs. The author accordingly argues that it is only through such adaptation that PATLIB centres will be able to provide higher quality, customer-related, added value services in support of innovation that are needed by users.

40|$|The Scottish Executive {{considered}} that ‘Diffuse Pollution from Agricultural Enterprises ’ was a priority issue for Scottish agriculture {{over the next}} 5 - 10 years and highlighted {{the need to improve}} knowledge <b>transfer,</b> <b>advice</b> and training through continued technical and professional development amongst farmers, crofters, contractors and advisers. In response to this report, The Scottish Environment Protection Agency commissioned SAC to survey advisory staff on their views on diffuse pollution issues, mitigation measures and delivery of environmental advice to the farming industry. The survey responses indicate that the impact of agricultural diffuse pollution on the environment {{is considered to be a}} serious problem as is the future impact of legislation on the farm business. To facilitate the rate of knowledge transfer to the industry there is an urgent requirement to raise advisers ’ awareness of environmental legislation and mitigation measures to reduce diffuse pollution. Advisers consider that farmers have limited awareness of diffuse pollution problems but those that do would consider the impact on the environment to be serious. Although advice is given by many advisers on pollution mitigation measures, there is a lack of knowledge on the effectiveness of these measures. Better technical information, supported by research, is required. This information is best conveyed to advisers via the internet, technical notes and directly by environmental specialists and delivered on to farmers by farm visits. Lack of funds prevent most farmers adopting best management practices to reduce diffuse pollution and more than 80 % of advisers consider that environmental advice should be free...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{dissertation}} is to identify the factors that explain success and failure in SME business transfers. Three key concepts have been defined in our research framework: firm resources, capabilities (of predecessor and successor) and (successor’s) strategic renewal. Firm resources originate from the resource-based view and are necessary to compete, to survive and to attain competitive advantage. The owner capabilities/human capital, such as education, experience and entrepreneurial capabilities are necessary to allocate the available firm resources. The successor’s renewal actions, including organizational changes and innovations, are vital to renew and adapt the firm to market situations. Altogether these three key concepts serve as predictors for the transfer outcomes: exit choice, transfer duration, obtained price, satisfaction and the post-transfer firm performance. The empirical results of this dissertation suggest, although not tested in one comprehensive dataset, that these three key concepts are complementary in SME business transfers. This {{is illustrated by the}} answers to main research questions. 1. Do firm resources or owner capabilities predict the exit choice for a sale or liquidation? 2. Do firm resources and owner capabilities predict performance during the transfer process? 3. Do renewal actions of the successor by themselves predict post-transfer firm performance? 4. Which kinds of capabilities predict success in business transfers? The results generate practical implications for government policy, advisors and entrepreneurs. The efforts of the Dutch government to stimulate start-ups may be less beneficial to the economy than spending the same budget and energy on potential (young) firm acquirers. Previous research shows that business transfers outperform start-ups in all fields and generate more employment. This dissertation shows that firm founders tend to liquidate their firm, whereas acquirers are more inclined to transfer their business. The Dutch government is advised to concentrate more on (young) firm acquirers and shift their budgets from start-ups, which have a relative low rate of survival, to acquiring a firm. The research outcomes lead one to question the relevance of succession planning for SMEs in transfer situations. Not only this study, but also most studies {{in the past two decades}} fail to provide evidence on the usefulness of succession planning. Both government agencies and advisors should reconsider their campaigns, which generally emphasize long term planning. Turnover, dependency on (few) customers and dependency of the firm on the owner, together with entrepreneurial flexibility, market awareness, years of ownership and familiarity with the successor are all better predictors of positive transfer outcomes such as an exit choice to sell (vs. liquidate), shorter transfer duration, greater satisfaction by the seller and obtained price. Furthermore, both advisors and the Dutch government seem to forget that 90 % of all firms are micro firms and these firms are not served with corporate planning, corporate strategies or corporate finance to stay in business. How to optimize their firm value and to look at their firm as an outsider could be a more interesting focus for small firm owners. The outcomes on firm size counter the prejudice against micro firms with employees that they are unfit for business transfers. Past research shows, however, that service to this group has been neglected; the market has failed to advise micro and small firms adequately regarding exit options. Accountants and bookkeepers are not well equipped to advice on ownership transfers. Experienced business brokers tend to focus on larger clients, who can support higher fees, ignoring the majority of small business owners. This study recommends government agencies to step into the market for <b>transfer</b> <b>advice.</b> Firm owners may benefit from results of this dissertation. The research results show that acquisition experience, making the firm less dependent on the owner and having a low dependency on (a few) customers improve the likelihood of a sale. If firm owners really want to sell their firm, adopting an acquirer’s perspective might help them. Also, having a replacement or employees which are allowed to decide on day to day matters, could help to make the firm less dependent on the owner/manager’s daily presence. Flexibility is the most important capability, since it speeds up the transfer and is associated with greater satisfaction. For potential buyers five aspects seem important. First, knowing a good relationship with the predecessor may ease the transfer process, but this may come at a price: the transfer duration is longer and the price to pay for the firm may be higher. Secondly, buying a smaller firm predicts a better post-transfer performance. This probably indicates that it is easier to realize change in smaller firms. Thirdly, it seems rewarding to buy during periods of economic decline. Post-transfer performance is better in declining economic conditions than in average or economic growth conditions. So patience is rewarded if one waits for the right time to buy. Finally, the findings show that renewal after succession pays off. This means renewal by successors in general seems to benefit and revitalize small firms. Innovation and reorganization together give the better results than reorganization alone. These findings are consistent with recent findings on large companies: companies that cut costs and lower their investments clearly underperform compared to companies that cut costs and keep on investing...|$|E

30|$|Peer advice networks, on {{the other}} hand, can also be {{classified}} as “instrumental ties” to {{reflect the fact that}} they involve cooperation to achieve some limited and immediate goals, which in this case amounts to the active pursuit of agricultural knowledge for the purposes of enhancing production. In the case of knowledge <b>transfer,</b> peer <b>advice</b> networks may be strongly attributed to such goals due to the active nature of knowledge seeking. Isaac et al. (2007) showed that particular farm management techniques relied on local ecological knowledge within the community, making the advice network from inside the community the primary source of knowledge of agroforestry management. In the classroom setting, peer advice networks can represent the ability or skill for information gathering. We expect farmers with stronger peer advice networks to perform better in learning outcomes due to their tendency to be more pro-active in information-processing and knowledge-gathering activities.|$|R
40|$|An {{observational}} workflow {{time study}} was conducted involving doctors in the emergency department (ED) of a large Australian hospital. During 121. 7 h across 58 sessions, we observed interruptive events, conceptualised as prompts, and doctors' strategies to handle those prompts (task-switching, multitasking, acknowledgement, deferral and deflection) to assess the role of multiple work system factors influencing doctors' work in the ED. Prompt rates varied vastly between work scenarios, being highest during non-verbal solo tasks. The propensity to use certain strategies also differed with task type, prompt type and location within the department, although task-switching {{was by far the}} most frequent. Communicative prompts were important in patient treatment and workload management.

40|$|One of the {{starting}} points of propositional proof complexity is the seminal paper by Cook and Reckhow [13], where they defined propositional proof systems as poly-time computable functions which have all propositional tautologies as their range. Motivated by provability consequences in bounded arithmetic, Cook and Krajíček [12] have recently started {{the investigation of}} proof systems which are computed by poly-time functions using advice. In this paper we concentrate on three fundamental questions regarding this new model. First, we investigate whether a given language L admits a polynomially bounded proof system with advice. Depending on {{the complexity of the}} underlying language L and the amount and type of the advice used by the proof system, we obtain different characterizations for this problem. In particular, we show that this question is tightly linked with the question whether L has small nondeterministic instance complexity. The second question concerns the existence of optimal proof systems with advice. For propositional proof systems, Cook and Krajíček [12] gave a surprising positive answer which we extend to all languages. These results show that providing proof systems with advice yields a more powerful model, but this model is also less directly applicable in practice. Our third question therefore asks whether the usage of advice in propositional proof systems can be simplified or even eliminated.

In typical encounters, the healer produces a multi-modal text-structure made up of verbal and nonverbal cues, through which he reflexively locates himself in a historical-cosmographic space: he positions himself as a mediator in a 2 ̆ 2 speech chain 2 ̆ 2 that <b>transfers</b> curative <b>advice</b> and power from incorporeal beings to the patient. With this described, this research then examines diverse reflexive constructions of 2 ̆ 2 modernity 2 ̆ 2 in healer-patient therapeutic encounters, turning to three modernizing initiatives that have arisen since the 1980 s: an ethnomedical center, Hôpital Traditionnel de Keur Massar; an ethnomedical call-in radio program broadcast from Dakar on satellite-radio; and a nongovernmental organization named Associazione di Cooperazione Rurale in Africa e America Latina (Association of Rural Cooperation in Africa and Latin America), based in Italy and with branches in Senegal. All three initiatives redefine ethnomedicine as a secular, phytotherapeutic 2 ̆ 2 tradition 2 ̆ 2 that is based on the efficacy of indigenous plants rather than on the social-interpersonal bonds between healer and patient. The convergence among these three initiatives is understood in terms of the shared context of global economic changes that began in the 1980 s, and specifically in relation to interventions by the Senegalese state, by the World Health Organization. This study also considers the divergence among these three initiatives in order to better understand the medical pluralism and hybridity within the category of what this study considers 2 ̆ 2 alternative medical modernities. 2 ̆ 2 In short, this study reveals how Senegalese both locally oppose and incorporate hegemonic notions of globalizing Western biomedicine, and how, in particular, these processes play out at the level of healer-patient communication. ...|$|R
40|$|Policy advice {{can help}} {{political}} actors design and implement institutional reforms through {{the generation of}} political and substantial legitimacy. This article clarifies the institutional pre-conditions of effective supply and <b>transfer</b> of policy <b>advice</b> with particular respect {{to the field of}} labor market and social policy reform and to corporatist arrangements where academic think tanks and social partner bodies for policy advice exist side by side. It shows how policy advice is structured and to what it extent it could influence actual policy-making in Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden over the last decade. Our main argument is that the structure of policy advice is essential for its effectiveness, with highly reputable and less contested expert committees and research institutes providing balanced policy-oriented advice are most influential and conducive to furthering labor market and welfare state reforms in corporatist settings. In combination with a shadow of hierarchy spent by government they can also facilitate social partner consensus. Hence, an appropriate supply of policy advice can help ensure sufficient legitimacy for institutional reforms and increase societal problem-solving capacities. If government is weak for institutional reasons and policy advice rather fragmented, challenged and less policy-oriented, like in the German case, policy advice can not realize its full potential...|$|R
30|$|Government support {{includes}} {{agricultural extension}} services, technology <b>transfer</b> (such as <b>advice</b> on food crop production, cash cropping, livestock production, and {{soil and water}} conservation), irrigation and water harvesting schemes, the education of women and children, provision of clean water and healthcare, and a stable functioning market system. The survey result of this discrete variable revealed that 34.4 and 65.6 % of the sample households receive and do not receive adequate government support to alleviate food security problems, respectively. Of these households, 35.6 and 34.1 % were food secure and food insecure, respectively. While 64.4 and 65.9 % of the households do not receive government support and become food secure and food insecure, respectively. The chi-square result of this variable is statistically insignificant at 95 % level of significance. Therefore, there is no association between government support and food security status of the rural farm households. This {{could be attributed to}} the fact that almost all farmers believed that agricultural production is dependent on natural conditions (climate change and rainfall variability), thereby the analysis of influencing factors of food security is concentrated mainly on such factors than government support. Their idea is supported by a study done in Niger by Barrett (2006). He revealed that food aid decreased government support to agriculture in the long run and caused distortion in the local price of food items.|$|R

40|$|Access to {{knowledge}} on farm management practices {{is essential for}} the maintenance of productive agroforestry systems. Farmers who lack the means to acquire farming knowledge from formal sources often rely on information within their informal social networks. However, little research has explored the explicit structure of farmer communication patterns. We examined advice network structures by using farmer attributes, i. e., kin relationships, community involvement, and imitation, to characterize structural positions and investigated the consequences of such structure on farming practices in cocoa agroforestry systems in Ghana, West Africa. Furthermore, we used a multicommunity approach; we constructed networks for four communities to increase replication and enhance the generality of our conclusions. A high density of advice ties occurred among a small group of farmers, indicating a core-periphery structure. Settler farmers composed 73 % of core position members, suggesting that social proximity did not control the formation of informal advice structures. Because core farmers were highly participative in community activities, the promotion of community involvement may facilitate the movement of knowledge and social exchange to strengthen informal networks. Farmers in both core and peripheral structural positions indicated that they observed fellow farmers and subsequently adopted their practices. Of highly sought farmers, 84 % used external information, predominately from government institutions, thus functioning as bridging links between formal and informal networks.

After considering the debate within the risk-communication community {{about the use of}} this kind of a regulatory tool, we analyse (using the example of fish consumption advice) the risk assessment that the advice is derived from.

50|$|On 7 April 1776, Williams {{opened for}} morning service a vacant chapel near Cavendish Square (the {{building}} was replaced in 1858 by All Saints, Margaret Street), using his liturgy, and reading lectures, with texts usually from the Bible, sometimes from classic authors. He got 'about {{a score of}} auditors', {{who seem to have}} been persons of distinction. The opening lecture was published. Copies of the liturgy were sent to Frederick the Great and to Voltaire, who returned appreciative letters in bad French and good English respectively. International botanical travellers Sir Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander 'now and then peeped into the chapel, and got away as fast as they decently could'. Williams's Letter to the Body of Protestant Dissenters, 1777, is a plea for such breadth of toleration as would legally cover such services as his. All the expenses fell on Williams, who was saved from ruin only by the subscription to his Lectures on the Universal Principles and Duties of Religion and Morality 1779. These lectures (critical rather than constructive, and not eloquent, though well written) were read at the chapel in 1776-1777. The experiment is said to have lasted four years, but it is probable that after the second year the services were not held in Margaret Street; they were <b>transferred,</b> on the <b>advice</b> of Robert Melville, to a room in the British Coffee House, Cockspur Street, Melville giving a dinner in Brewer Street after service, 'with excellent Madeira'. The statement by Thomas Somerville that Melville took him, in the period 1779-1785, to the service in 'Portland' Square is no doubt due to a slip of memory. Somerville's further statement that the 'dispersion of his flock' was due to Williams's 'immorality' becoming 'notorious' seems a groundless slander. No hint of it is conveyed in the satiric lampoon Orpheus, Priest of Nature 1781, which affirms, on the contrary, that Williams's principles were too strict for his hearers. The appellation 'Priest of Nature' {{is said to have been}} first given him by Franklin; 'Orpheus' ascribes it to 'a Socratic woollen-draper of Covent Garden'. Gregoire affirms that he had it from Williams that a number of his followers passed from deism to atheism.|$|R
