5|$|Fruit {{bodies have}} an odour {{described}} variously as resembling garlic, radish, lemon, onion, or skunk, and <b>taste</b> <b>like</b> radish. Although some older sources report P.squarrosa as edible, the mushroom has caused several cases of poisoning. The afflicted individuals had consumed alcohol with the mushroom, then experienced vomiting and diarrhoea about ten hours later. The toxic effect {{may be due}} to the combination of eating the mushrooms and taking alcohol, although the extended time delay between consumption and symptoms suggests the mechanism of toxicity is different than the antabuse-effect experienced from Coprinopsis atramentaria with alcohol.|$|E
5|$|After drying, the {{harvested}} stems or rhizomes were steamed for 24 {{hours or}} more in the umu tī pit. Steaming converted the carbohydrate fructan in the stems to very sweet fructose. The cooked stems or rhizomes were then ﬂattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. Kāuru could be stored dry until {{the time came to}} add it to fern root and other foods to improve their palatability. The sugar in the stems or rhizomes would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which were easily separated by tearing them apart. Kāuru could also be dipped in water and chewed, and was said to smell and <b>taste</b> <b>like</b> molasses.|$|E

50|$|Clefting: Splitting {{a single}} clause into two clauses, {{each with its}} own verb, e.g. ‘The chicken turtles <b>tasted</b> <b>like</b> chicken.’ becomes ‘It was the chicken turtle | that <b>tasted</b> <b>like</b> chicken.’ In this case, clefting is used to shift the focus of the {{sentence}} to the subject, chicken turtle.|$|R
5|$|The two-colored bolete is an edible mushroom, {{although}} some {{may have an}} allergic reaction after ingestion that results in stomach upset. The mushroom has a very mild to no taste although {{it is said to}} have a very distinctive <b>taste</b> <b>like</b> that of the king bolete. It can be cooked several ways, and the varying color of the cap can be used to determine if the mushroom is ready to be eaten. If the cap is a lighter red, then it is less mature and is in a stage where it is often larva infested or it can be soft fleshed, in some cases both. The cap should have a dark brick red color when safe to eat. Drying the two-colored bolete is a good method for storage. It is important to note the time it takes for the two-colored bolete to bruise when identifying it for consumption; the mushroom should take several minutes to bruise compared to the instant bruising of Boletus sensibilis, which is poisonous and has many of the same visual characteristics of the two-colored bolete.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} karmas provide different {{abilities of}} tastes to the bodies: tikta rasa nama-karma gives a bitter <b>taste</b> (<b>like</b> {{that of the}} nimba fruit), kasaya rasa nama-karma gives an astringent <b>taste</b> (<b>like</b> that of bibhitaka), amla rasa nama-karma gives a sour <b>taste</b> (<b>like</b> that of tamarind) and madhura rasa nama-karma gives a sweet <b>taste</b> (<b>like</b> that of sugar). The salt taste is produced {{by a combination of}} the sweet taste with another. Bitter and biting tastes are considered unpleasant, the others pleasant.|$|E

25|$|This {{is another}} rare form of synesthesia where certain tastes are {{experienced}} when hearing words. For example, the word basketball might <b>taste</b> <b>like</b> waffles. The documentary 'Derek Tastes Of Earwax' gets {{its name from}} this phenomenon, in references to pub owner James Wannerton who experiences this particular sensation whenever he hears the name spoken. It is estimated that 0.2% {{of the population has}} this form of synesthesia.|$|E
25|$|The {{drinking}} straw is a tube used for transferring a liquid to the mouth, usually {{a drink from}} one location to another. The first crude forms of {{drinking straw}}s were made of dry, hollow, rye grass. Marvin Stone is {{the inventor of the}} drinking straw. Stone, who worked in a factory that made paper cigarette holders, did not like this design because it made beverages <b>taste</b> <b>like</b> grass. As an alternative, on January 3, 1888, Stone got a piece of paper from his factory and wrapped it around a pencil. By coating it with wax, his drinking straw became leak-proof so that it would not get waterlogged.|$|E

25|$|Some insects {{present in}} the grapes at harvest inevitably {{end up in the}} press {{and for the most part}} are inoffensive. Others, notably types of ladybirds, or the multicoloured Asian lady beetle, release {{unpleasant}} volatile compounds as a defensive mechanism when disturbed. In sufficient quantities these can affect the wine's bouquet and taste. With an olfactory detection threshold of a few ppb, the principal active compounds are methoxypyrazines, or pyrazines, that are perceived as rancid peanut butter, bitter herb, green bell pepper, or cat urine. This is also a naturally occurring compound in Sauvignon grapes and so ladybird taint has been known to make Rieslings <b>taste</b> <b>like</b> Sauvignon blanc.|$|E
25|$|Work {{continues}} on substituting vegetable proteins and protein concentrates for fish meal in the salmonid diet. As of 2014, an enzymatic {{process can be}} used to lower the carbohydrate content of barley, making it a high-protein fish feed suitable for salmon. Many other substitutions for fish meal are known, and diets containing zero fish meal are possible. For example, a planned closed containment salmon fish farm in Scotland uses ragworms, algae and amino acids as feed. However, commercial economic animal diets are determined by least cost linear programming models that are effectively competing with similar models for chicken and pig feeds for the same feed ingredients and these models show that fish meal is more useful in aquatic diets than in chicken diets, where they can make the chickens <b>taste</b> <b>like</b> fish. Unfortunately, this substitution can result in lower levels of the highly valued omega-3 content in the farmed product. However, when vegetable oil is used in the growing diet as an energy source and a different finishing diet containing high omega-3 content fatty acids from either fish oil, algae oils or some vegetable oils are used a few months before harvest, this problem is eliminated.|$|E
25|$|Gundelia {{is a low}} to high (20–100cm) thistle-like {{perennial}} {{herbaceous plant}} with latex, spiny compound inflorescences, reminiscent of teasles and eryngos, that contain cream, yellow, greenish, pink, purple or redish-purple disk florets. It is assigned to the daisy family. Flowers can be found from February to May. The stems of this plant dry-out when the seeds are ripe and break free from the underground root, and are then blown away like a tumbleweed, thus spreading the seeds effectively over large areas with little standing vegetation. This plant is native to the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle-East. Opinions differ {{about the number of}} species in Gundelia. Sometimes the genus is regarded monotypic, Gundelia tournefortii being a species with a large variability, but other authors distinguish up to nine species, differing in floret color and pubescence. Young stems are cooked and eaten in the Middle-East and are said to <b>taste</b> <b>like</b> a combination of artichoke and asparagus. The plant also contains compounds that have been demonstrated to be effective against a range of ailments. A large quantity of pollen assigned to Gundelia has been found on the Shroud of Turin, which may suggest that the crown of thorns was made from Gundelia, but this finding has been contested.|$|E
