2500|$|The early 1950s {{was often}} {{referred}} to as the [...] "Industrial Revolution." [...] Numerous companies, such as IBM (whose Lexington operations are now the core of Lexmark), Square D, and Dixie Cup opened operations within the city. This was soon followed by <b>Trane.</b> During this rapid growth between the years of 1954 and 1963, Lexington's employment rose 260 percent. The manufacturing output for the city rose fourfold. Between 1960 and 1970, the population of Lexington increased by 32% to just over 108,000. All of this industrial investment, coupled with a high demand for housing, led Lexington to become the 14th fastest-developing metropolitan area in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Impulse!, a jazz {{label and}} {{subsidiary}} of ABC-Paramount Records, {{was established in}} 1960 in Santa Monica, California by producer Creed Taylor.

[...] In 1964 Alexandria moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of further opportunities to perform in clubs and record, quickly becoming a featured vocalist at popular venues that included the Parisian Room and Marla's Memory Lane. Getting signed to Impulse! Records was anticipated to be her jump onto the national stage after seven years of working with independent labels at King and Argo.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first major}} stirrings {{came in the}} 1950s with the early work of Ornette Coleman (whose 1960 album [...] coined the term) and Cecil Taylor. [...] In the 1960s, exponents {{included}} Albert Ayler, Gato Barbieri, Carla Bley, Don Cherry, Larry Coryell, John Coltrane, Bill Dixon, Jimmy Giuffre, Steve Lacy, Michael Mantler, Sun Ra, Roswell Rudd, Pharoah Sanders, and John Tchicai. [...] In developing his late style, Coltrane was especially influenced by the dissonance of Ayler's trio with bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Sunny Murray, a rhythm section honed with Cecil Taylor as leader. [...] In November 1961, Coltrane played a gig at the Village Vanguard, {{which resulted in the}} classic Chasin' the 'Trane, which Down Beat magazine panned as [...] "Anti-Jazz". [...] On his 1961 tour of France, he was booed, but persevered, signing with the new Impulse! Records in 1960 and turning it into [...] "the house that <b>Trane</b> built", while championing many younger free jazz musicians, notably Archie Shepp, who often played with trumpeter Bill Dixon, who organized the 4-day [...] "October Revolution in Jazz" [...] in Manhattan in 1964, the first free jazz festival.|$|E

2500|$|After being {{discharged}} from his duties in the Navy, as a seaman first class in August 1946, Coltrane returned to Philadelphia, where he [...] "plunged into the heady {{excitement of the}} new music and the blossoming bebop scene." [...] After touring with King Kolax, he joined a Philly-based band led by Jimmy Heath, who was introduced to Coltrane's playing by his former Navy buddy, the trumpeter William Massey, who had played with Coltrane in the Melody Masters. In Philadelphia after the war, he studied jazz theory with guitarist and composer Dennis Sandole and continued under Sandole's tutelage through the early 1950s. Originally an altoist, in 1947 Coltrane also began playing tenor saxophone with the Eddie Vinson Band. Coltrane later referred to {{this point in his}} life as a time when [...] "a wider area of listening opened up for me. There were many things that people like Hawk , and Ben [...] and Tab Smith were doing in the '40s that I didn't understand, but that I felt emotionally." [...] A significant influence, according to tenor saxophonist Odean Pope, was the Philadelphia pianist, composer, and theorist Hasaan Ibn Ali. [...] "Hasaan was the clue to ... the system that <b>Trane</b> uses. Hasaan was the great influence on Trane’s melodic concept." ...|$|E
2500|$|Afrikaans {{music was}} {{primarily}} influenced by Dutch folk styles, along with French and German influences, {{in the early}} twentieth century. Zydeco-type string bands led by a concertina were popular, as were elements of American country music, especially Jim Reeves.The most prolific composers of [...] "tiekie draai" [...] Afrikaans music were lyricist Anton De Waal who wrote many hit songs with songwriters, pianist Charles Segal ("Hey Babariebab Se Ding Is Vim", [...] "Kalkoenjie", [...] "Sy Kom Van Kommetjie" [...] and many others) and accordianist, Nico Carstens. Bushveld music based on the Zulu were reinterpreted by such singers as Marais and Miranda. Melodramatic and sentimental songs called <b>trane</b> trekkers (tear walker's) were especially common. In 1973, a country music song won the coveted SARI Award (South African Music Industry) for the Song of the Year – [...] "My Children, My Wife" [...] was written by renowned South African composer Charles Segal and lyricist Arthur Roos. In 1979 the South African Music scene changed from the Tranetrekkers to more lively sounds and the introduction of new names in the market with the likes of Anton Goosen, David Kramer (singer), Koos du Plessis, Fanie de Jager, Flaming Victory and Laurika Rauch.

40|$|Complementary {{field and}} {{laboratory}} tests confirmed and quantified the pollination abilities of <b>Tranes</b> sp. weevils and Cycadothrips chadwicki thrips, specialist insects {{of their respective}} cycad hosts, Macrozamia machinii and M. lucida. No agamospermous seeds were produced when both wind and insects were excluded from female cones; and the exclusion of wind-vectored pollen alone did not eliminate seed set, because insects were able to reach the cone. Based on enclosure pollination tests, each weevil pollinates an average 26. 2 ovules per cone and each thrips 2. 4 ovules per cone. These pollinators visited similar numbers of ovules per cone in fluorescent dye tests that traced insect movement through cones. Fluorescent dye granules deposited by Cycadothrips were concentrated around the micropyle of each visited ovule, the site of pollen droplet release, where pollen must be deposited to achieve pollination. In contrast, <b>Tranes</b> weevils left dye scattered on different areas of each visited ovule, indicating that chance plays {{a greater role in}} this system. Each weevil and 25 thrips delivered 6. 2 and 5. 2 pollen grains, respectively, on average, to each visited ovule per cone, based on examination of dissected pollen canals. In sum, the pollination potential of 25 Cycadothrips approximates that of one <b>Tranes</b> weevil...|$|R
