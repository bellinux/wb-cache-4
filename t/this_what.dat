5|$|A log {{portion of}} the {{original}} Oklahoma Row was moved north and now sits {{on the east side}} of Highway 94 in Monte Ne. It is used for storage. The three-story concrete-and-stone tower still stands and remains above water on the edge of Beaver Lake. This section is often incorrectly referred to as the bank building and the honeymoon suite. Monte Ne was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 because of the historic significance of being so closely associated with Harvey and its unique architecture and engineering. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>what</b> is left of Monte Ne has fallen victim to severe neglect and vandalism. It is covered with spray paint and graffiti, as well as being cracked and full of debris. In 2011 the fire department was called to help a person who had climbed to the top floor and gotten stuck in the chimney. Because of this incident and the general state of the remains, the Army Corps of Engineers erected a temporary barbed wire fence around the tower.|$|E
5|$|To crown all <b>this</b> , <b>what</b> is {{left but}} the amphitheatre? And this disgrace {{of the city}} you have as well—Gracchus not {{fighting}} as equipped as a Mirmillo, with buckler or falchion (for he condemns—yes, condemns and hates such equipment). Nor does he conceal his face beneath a helmet. See! he wields a trident. When he has cast without effect the nets suspended from his poised right hand, he boldly lifts his uncovered face to the spectators, and, easily to be recognized, flees across the whole arena. We can not mistake the tunic, since the ribbon of gold reaches from his neck, and flutters in the breeze from his high-peaked cap. Therefore, the disgrace, which the Secutor had to submit to, in being forced to fight with Gracchus, was worse than any wound.|$|E
25|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Is <b>This</b> <b>What</b> You Want? began in London in June 1968. The {{majority of the}} songs were recorded in Los Angeles in October–November that year, after Harrison had completed work on the Beatles' White Album. Among the other guest musicians on the album {{were members of the}} Wrecking Crew, Eric Clapton, Nicky Hopkins, Klaus Voormann and John Barham. Although the album received favourable reviews, it failed to achieve commercial success. The 2010 reissue includes bonus tracks covering the rest of Lomax's output while on Apple Records.|$|E

25|$|Just as I {{was pushing}} {{one of our}} men back into the ranks I saw him fall at my feet from a sabre slash. I turned round instantly– to see English cavalry forcing their way into our midst and hacking us to pieces. Just as it is difficult, if not impossible, for the best cavalry to break into {{infantry}} who are formed into squares and who defend themselves with coolness and daring, so {{it is true that}} once the ranks have been penetrated, then resistance is useless and nothing remains for the cavalry to do but to slaughter at almost no risk to themselves. <b>This</b> <b>what</b> happened, in vain our poor fellows stood up and stretched out their arms; they could not reach far enough to bayonet these cavalrymen mounted on powerful horses, and the few shots fired in chaotic melee were just as fatal to our own men as to the English. And so we found ourselves defenceless against a relentless enemy who, in the intoxication of battle, sabred even our drummers and fifers without mercy.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Popular Mechanics named The Truman Show {{as one of}} the 10 most prophetic {{science fiction}} films. Journalist Erik Sofge argued that the story {{reflects}} the falseness of reality television. [...] "Truman simply lives, and the show's popularity is its straightforward voyeurism. And, like Big Brother, Survivor, and every other reality show on the air, none of his environment is actually real." [...] He deemed it an eerie coincidence that Big Brother made its debut a year after the film's release, and he also compared the film to the 2003 program The Joe Schmo Show: [...] "Unlike Truman, Matt Gould could see the cameras, but all of the other contestants were paid actors, playing the part of various reality-show stereotypes. While Matt eventually got all of the prizes in the rigged contest, the show's central running joke was in the same existential ballpark as The Truman Show." [...] Weir declared, [...] "There has always been this question: Is the audience getting dumber? Or are we filmmakers patronizing them? Is <b>this</b> <b>what</b> they want? Or is <b>this</b> <b>what</b> we're giving them? But the public went to my film in large numbers. And that has to be encouraging." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison's {{version of}} [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] was an {{international}} number 1 {{hit by the}} end of 1970 and through the early months of 1971 – the first solo single by a Beatle to reach the top, and the biggest seller by any of the four throughout the 1970s. Without the support of any concert appearances or promotional interviews by Harrison, the single's commercial success was due to its impact on radio, where, Harrison biographer Gary Tillery writes, the song [...] "rolled across the airwaves like a juggernaut, with commanding presence, much the way Dylan's 'Like a Rolling Stone' had arrived in the mid-sixties". Elton John recalls first hearing [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] in a taxi and names it as the last of the era's great singles: [...] "I thought, 'Oh my God,' and I got chills. You know when a record starts on the radio, and it's great, and you think, 'Oh, what is <b>this,</b> <b>what</b> is <b>this,</b> <b>what</b> is this?' The only other record I ever felt that way about [...] was 'Brown Sugar'..." [...] In his 40-page Harrison tribute article for Rolling Stone in 2002, Mikal Gilmore credited [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] as being [...] "as pervasive on radio and in youth consciousness as anything the Beatles had produced".|$|E
500|$|At the premiere, John Williams {{conducted}} a live {{performance of the}} score. The new release grossed $68 million in total, with $35 million coming from Canada and the United States. The changes to it, particularly the escape scene, were criticized as political correctness. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wondered, [...] "Remember those guns the feds carried? Thanks to the miracle of digital, they're now brandishing walkie-talkies.... Is <b>this</b> <b>what</b> two decades have done to free speech?" [...] Chris Hewitt of Empire wrote, [...] "The changes are surprisingly low-key...while ILM's CGI E.T. is used sparingly as a complement to Carlo Rambaldi's extraordinary puppet."

500|$|Harrison wrote [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] {{to promote}} Transcendental Meditation, which the Beatles had been {{studying}} in Rishikesh with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The group recorded a demo of the song while considering material for their 1968 double album, The Beatles (also known as the White Album). On release, Lomax's single was overshadowed in Apple's [...] "Our First Four" [...] promotional campaign by the Beatles' [...] "Hey Jude" [...] and Mary Hopkin's [...] "Those Were the Days"; it enjoyed only minor success internationally, becoming a top 30 hit in Canada.

In [...] "You Take for Granted", Mike is murdered by a vengeful loan shark. The final episodes of the series deal with Susan grieving and eventually moving on from Mike's death. In the series finale, Julie gives birth to a daughter, whom she now plans on keeping. Susan sells her home on Wisteria Lane and she and M.J. move to help Julie raise the baby.|$|E

[...] "What happened in Bradford is very fresh in people's minds and given all the violence which happened in Cumbria just hours earlier, it was insensitive," [...] said Lynn Costello of Mothers Against Violence.

500|$|In his {{preview of}} Apple's 2010 reissues, for Rolling Stone, David Fricke listed Is <b>This</b> <b>What</b> You Want? third among the label's top five non-Beatle album {{releases}} and praised [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] as, variously, a [...] "get-off-your-ass rocker" [...] and [...] "dynamite".

Among reviews of the Come and Get It compilation, Douglas Wolk of Pitchfork Media opined that [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] "would've {{been one of the}} best songs on [...] if George had kept it for himself", while Uncuts David Cavanagh described the track as [...] "sensational".

500|$|Andrić felt he {{was destined}} to become a writer. He began writing in {{secondary}} school, but received little encouragement from his mother. He recalled that when he showed her {{one of his first}} works, she replied: [...] "Did you write <b>this?</b> <b>What</b> did you do that for?" [...] Andrić published his first two poems in 1911 in a journal called Bosanska vila (Bosnian Fairy), which promoted Serbo-Croat unity. At the time, he was still a secondary school student. Prior to World War I, his poems, essays, reviews, and translations appeared in journals such as Vihor (Whirlwind), Savremenik (The Contemporary), Hrvatski pokret (The Croatian Movement), and Književne novine (Literary News). One of Andrić’s favorite literary forms was lyrical reflective prose, and many of his essays and shorter pieces are prose poems. The historian Wayne S. Vucinich describes Andrić’s poetry from this period as [...] "subjective and mostly melancholic". Andrić’s translations of August Strindberg, Walt Whitman, and a number of Slovene authors also appeared around this time.|$|E
