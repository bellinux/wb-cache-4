40|$|Almost {{ten years}} ago, Gilles Kahn used the fixed point theory of Dana Scott {{to define a}} formal and elegant model of {{computation}} for determinate dataflow graphs, networks of determinate processes communicating asynchronously through unbounded channels.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{software}} architecture, {{there has been a}} paradigm shift front describing the outcome of architecting process to documenting Architectural Knowledge (AK), such as design decisions and rationale. To this end, a series of domain models have been proposed for defining the concepts and their relationships in {{the field of}} AK. To a large extent, the merit of this new paradigm is derived by sharing and reusing AK across organizations, especially in geographically distributed contexts. However the employment of different AK domain models by different parties makes effective AK sharing challenging, as it needs to be mapped either from one domain model to another directly, or indirectly through a central model for simplicity when the number of AK models increases. The indirect mapping approach {{has proved to be a}} cost-effective way by sacrificing acceptable sharing quality compared with direct mapping approach. However there exist no criteria for the selection of a high quality central model besides the intuitive judgment by domain experts.

40|$|In many countries, place {{specific}} {{investments in}} infrastructure are viewed as integral components of territorial development policies. But are these policies fighting market forces of concentration? Or are they adding net value to the national economy by tapping underexploited resources? This paper contributes to {{the debate on the}} spatial allocation of infrastructure investments by examining where these investments will generate the highest economic returns"spatial efficiency", and identifying whether <b>there</b> <b>re</b> tradeoffs when infrastructure coverage is made more equitable across regions"spatial equity". The empirical analysis focuses on Uganda and is based on estimating models of firm location choice, drawing on insights from the new economic geography literature. The main findings show that establishments in the manufacturing industry gain from being in areas that offer a diverse mix of economic activities. In addition, availability of power supply, transport links connecting districts to markets, and the supply of skilled workers attract manufacturing activities. Combining all these factors gives a distinct advantage to existing agglomerations along leading areas around Kampala and Jinja. Infrastructure investments in these areas are likely to produce the highest returns compared with investments elsewhere. Public infrastructure investments in other locations are likely to attract fewer private investors, and will pose a spatial efficiencyequity tradeoff.

40|$|Charles Darwin {{appears to}} have had little {{appreciation}} for parasites. His neglect was probably symptomatic of the mood of naturalists of his time: Parasites were viewed as degenerate and generally unworthy of the attention of sen-sible Victorian naturalists. This is unfortunate, because the field of parasitology offers {{some of the most}} striking and elegant examples of adaptation that could no doubt have aided Darwin’s efforts to have his theory of natural selec-tion gain acceptance. Indeed, {{it is now clear that}} parasites and pathogens offer paradigmatic examples of evolution in action: Due to their often short generation time, they can be observed evolving in the laboratory (Rainey 2004; Morgan et al. 2005) and even in the real world, as evi-denced by the evolution of drug resistance (Marchese et al. 2000), emerging diseases (Morse 1994), and vaccine escape mutants (Bangham et al. 1999). Of course, parasite adaptation is only half the story, and host defense systems offer equally striking, indeed strikingly complex, exam-ples of adaptation. Thus, the host–parasite interaction is a dynamic coevolutionary relationship. Darwin was clearly aware of the importance of some coevolutionary scenarios (in particular, pollination), but the ramifications of host– parasite coevolution were not among them. Today, <b>there</b> <b>re</b> mains considerable need to understand the nature and full significance of antagonistic parasitic interactions.

40|$|This thesis studies three {{different}} inverse problems. We start by defining {{the concept of}} inverse problems in the mathematical literature. <b>There</b> <b>re</b> four basic questions about any inverse problem: existence, uniqueness, stability and reconstruction. We address the last three of them {{in each of the}} problems under study, but we pay specific attention to the question of stability. ^ The first problem is the hyperbolic inverse boundary value problem, were one wants to recover the speed and trajectories of propagation of a wave (modeled by a Riemannian metric) and additional physical properties (modeled by a covector field and a potential), from the boundary information encoded in the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. This problem is equivalent to the inverse boundary spectral problem, non-stationary inverse Schrödinger equations and the Gel 2 ̆ 7 fand 2 ̆ 7 s inverse boundary problem. It has application to the inverse kinematic problem that comes naturally in geophysical applications. We proof local Hölder stability of simultaneously determining the metric, the covector field and the potential from the hyperbolic DN map. We work near generic simple metrics. The proof uses complex geometric optics solutions and stability for the problem of boundary rigidity to get stability for the metric. In the process, we explicitly recover the X-ray transform of the covector field and the potential along geodesics. We apply stability estimates of the X-ray transform over tensor fields to stably recover the covector field and the potential. ^ In the second problem, we consider the inverse problem of Current Density Impedance Imaging (CDII). CDII is a developing modality that overcomes the poor spatial resolution of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) by combining Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measurements with electrical measurements. In CDII, electric current is injected into the body and an MRI machine is used to measure the internal current density of the body. This additional information enables improvement in the spatial resolution and mitigates for the instability of the EIT problem. We prove global Hölder stability for the problem of CDII using complete and partial data. We use the magnitude of the current density as the internal measurement. In fact, we only need the projection of the current density onto a one dimensional subspace depending on the potential. The proof is based on a factorization of the non-linear internal functional and its linearization, and does not reduce the problem to the 1 -Laplacian. In the factorization, there is an underlying operator that describes the behavior beneath the CDII problem. This operator is degenerate elliptic and we prove it is stable by superposition of elliptic operators. ^ The third and last problem, is known as imaged based visual acuity correction. This problem consists on determining an image, called precorrected image, that when observed by an individual with visual refraction problems (e. g., myopia, hyperopia, etc.), the precorrected image will appear sharper than directly observing the original (unprocessed) image. Our reconstruction is based on a constrained total variation deconvolution that controls the instability of a deconvolution-based operator and ensures pixel values are optimized in a determined range, to project on screen. We introduce a term called relative total variation which enables controlling the trade off between ringing-reduction, contrast gain and sharpness, in the precorrected images. Our approach does not require custom hardware. Instead, the precorrected image can be shown on a standard computer display, on printed paper, or superimposed on a physical scene using a projector. The results have been validated by simulation, in camera-screen experiments, and in a user study. Moreover, the images produced by our method are the first full field view high contrast color images to be tested by human observers. ...|$|E
