25|$|With no {{constitutional}} amendment done, Annadurai declared 26 January 1965, the 15th Republic Day of India {{and also the}} day the Constitution, which in essence enshrined Hindi as the official language of India, came into practice, as a day of mourning. This move was opposed by the then Chief Minister of Madras State, Bhakthavatchalam, as blasphemous. Hence Annadurai, who by then had been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> off the secessionist image of his party, declared 24 January as a day of mourning. He also replaced the slogan of the protests to Down with Hindi; Long live the Republic. Nevertheless, violence broke out on 26 January, initially in Madurai which within days spread throughout the state. Robert Hardgrave Jr, professor of humanities, government and Asian studies, suggests that the elements contributing to the riots were not instigated by DMK or Leftists or even the industrialists, as the Congress government of the state suggested, but were genuine frustrations and discontentment which lay {{beneath the surface of}} the people of the state.|$|E
500|$|In 1985 Michael Bloom of The Boston Phoenix {{wrote that}} Cheap at Half the Price [...] "will {{never get the}} hearing it deserves". He said that Frith was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> off this [...] "progressive" [...] mould he had been cast in, and {{believed}} that the songs on the album should be judged on their own merit and not as [...] "rarefied art rock". One 1984 reviewer found the album [...] "a very enjoyable recording", and stated that Frith's music [...] "is changing the way many musicians look at the sounds that they take so seriously". The New Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock described Cheap at Half the Price as Frith's response to punk, a low-tech approach to performing songs. It called the album a [...] "twisted pop" [...] record, {{saying that it is}} [...] "as uncompromising as everything else Frith recorded". François Couture in a review of Frith's 2002 album, Prints called Cheap at Half the Price [...] "the best tongue-in-cheek take at the New Wave".|$|E
500|$|In {{recognition}} of his achievements with the under-20 side, senior manager José Pékerman gave Messi his first call-up for a friendly against Hungary on 17 August 2005. Aged 18, Messi made his senior debut for Argentina when he came on in the 63rd minute, only to be sent off after two minutes for a perceived foul against Vilmos Vanczák, who had grabbed his shirt; Messi had struck the defender with his arm while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> him off, which the referee interpreted as an intentional elbowing, a contentious decision. Messi was reportedly found weeping {{in the dressing room}} after his sending-off. He returned to the team on 3 September in their World Cup qualifier defeat to Paraguay, which he had declared his [...] "re-debut" [...] ahead of the match. Messi started his first game in the next qualifying match against Peru, in which he was able to win a crucial penalty that secured their victory. After the match, Pékerman described him as [...] "a jewel". He subsequently made regular appearances for the team ahead of Argentina's participation in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, scoring his first goal in a friendly against Croatia on 1 March 2006. A hamstring injury sustained a week later jeopardised his presence in the World Cup, but he was nevertheless selected for Pékerman's squad and regained fitness in time {{for the start of the}} tournament.|$|E

25|$|Nancy <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> Leslie's flipper, but Leslie cannot {{grasp the}} concept. Nancy and Charlie explain {{the concept of}} the handshake, as well as their differing anatomy. The lizards have only legs and flippers. Nancy finally shakes hands with the lizards. Charlie <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> hands with Leslie, but Leslie is still {{uncertain}} about him. Leslie and Charlie talk about their differences. Leslie asks about their clothing. Among other things, Nancy tells them that clothes cover their sexual organs.|$|R
2500|$|Heinlein was {{surprised}} that some readers thought the book described how he believed society should be organized, explaining: [...] "I was not giving answers. I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> the reader loose from some preconceptions and induce him to think for himself, along new and fresh lines. In consequence, each reader gets something different out of that book because he himself supplies the answers ... It is an invitation to think – not to believe." ...|$|E
2500|$|At first, {{the only}} soldier indicted was the sentry, who {{was sentenced to}} a six months imprisonment. Only {{following}} public pressure did Chief of Staff Dan Shomron decide to take further proceedings and transfer the brigade operations officer from his position. This {{gave birth to the}} phrase [...] "The sentry syndrome" [...] (Tismonet HaShin-Gimel), meaning that a system is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> off responsibility for a failure by putting all the blame on the lowest possible rank.|$|E
2500|$|The {{failure of}} the Expedition only served to {{discourage}} settling in Guiana. The colony earned the nickname Enfer Vert ("Green Hell"), which it is still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake.</b> No other project of mass colonisation was undertaken, and the population of Whites was always drastically {{lower than that of}} the slaves. The population of the colony, of all races, did not rise above 20,000 until the gold rush (starting in 1855), [...] the second abolition of slavery in 1848 and the founding of the prisons.|$|E

2500|$|Israel called {{together}} an emergency cabinet meeting, {{and said that}} it held the Beirut government responsible for the attack, vowing that it would pay a [...] "heavy price" [...] for the attacks, adding [...] "The Lebanese government, of which Hezbollah is a part, is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> regional stability". Plans to locate [...] "thousands" [...] of reserve troops were also announced. Israeli Defence Minister Amir Peretz also said that [...] "the State of Israel sees itself free to use all measures that it finds it needs, and the [...] have been given orders in that direction." [...] The United Nations envoy to the region, Geir Pedrson, condemned the Hezbollah action and called on Hezbollah to release the soldiers.|$|E
2500|$|To {{comply with}} this prohibition, {{a number of}} {{preparation}} techniques became practiced within traditional Judaism. The main technique, known as melihah, involves the meat being soaked in water for about half an hour, which opens pores. After this, the meat is placed on a slanted board or in a wicker basket, and is thickly covered with salt on each side, then left for between 20 minutes and one hour. The salt covering draws blood from the meat by osmosis, and the salt must be subsequently removed from the meat (usually by <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> most of it off and then washing the meat twice) to complete the extraction of the blood. [...] The type of salt used in the process is known as kosher salt.|$|E
2500|$|In {{preparing}} for the recording of episodes, long and acrimonious shouting matches occurred between Milligan and BBC managers {{as he tried to}} get his own way. Was he a diva? [...] "I was in the Goon Show days", he told Dick Lester. [...] "I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> the BBC out of its apathy. Sound effects were 'a knock on the door and tramps on gravel'– that was it, and I tried to transform it." [...] Using techniques already developed by the drama department, he went on to give the show an indelible sense of reality, going {{out of his way to}} achieve maximum believability by the use of FX (live sound effects) and Grams (pre-recorded sound effects), making the show the first comedic production of its kind to try actively to persuade the listeners that the happenings were real, and especially to create alternate realities or surreal audio imagery that would be impossible to realise visually. This approach was echoed on television in Monty Python's Flying Circus which began in 1969, through the surreal animation inserts created by Terry Gilliam.|$|E

60|$|And {{then the}} {{students}} in the road clambered into the carryall and tumbled all over the Rovers, hugging them and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> hands at the same time.|$|E
60|$|Billy made no reply. He was {{thinking}} of the slovenly, blear-eyed woman who had brought him into the world. The memory was far from pleasant. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> it off.|$|R

60|$|At this taunt {{the crab}} reached out its other claw and seized the zebra's ear, and the {{creature}} gave {{a cry of}} pain and began prancing up and down, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> off the crab, which clung fast.|$|E
60|$|All {{at once he}} stopped. The bitter despair in {{his tone}} {{was the voice of}} a heavy feeling of which Siegmund had been vaguely aware for some weeks. Siegmund felt a sense of doom. He laughed, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> it off.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah me!" [...] {{continued}} the scout, [...] "it do take the manhood {{out of a}} fellow, that drink. Even when his indignation's roused and he <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> it off, he can't do it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "So it does," [...] said Raymond, in {{the same}} dreamy manner, as if <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> {{something}} off. [...] "Some years, isn't it? I wanted it done, somehow. I would sit down to it now, only I have fallen asleep a dozen times over it already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What nonsense!" [...] I said, faint-heartedly. I {{stood for}} a time at my bedroom window <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> this fact {{altogether}} off my mind.

60|$|Vainly she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> off an unaccustomed {{feeling of}} nervousness: she was {{trembling}} {{from head to}} foot. A wild, unconquerable desire seized her to see her husband again, at once, if only he had not already started.|$|R
