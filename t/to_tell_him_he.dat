5|$|On the November 19, 1999, {{episode of}} Millionaire, Carpenter {{proceeded}} {{to advance to}} the million-dollar question without using any lifelines. He then used his Phone-A-Friend to call his father not for help, but rather <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> was going to win the game. Carpenter answered the question correctly and became the show's first millionaire. His win gave him national recognition and led to multiple talk show appearances, as well as reappearances on Millionaire itself.|$|E

Yogesh sees all of the girls in a dream, {{and in the morning}} decides who he will marry. He goes to Rajni's office because she offered a 50-million-rupee dowry, and is {{relieved}} to discover that she is marrying someone else. Yogesh goes to Devu's house <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> wants to marry Vishakha, but Devu calls her and rejects her. He says {{there is no need for}} Yogesh to marry her; he knows about Jitu's debt, and says he will choose Yogesh's bride himself.|$|E

One of his fraternity brothers played a joke on him on draft day, pretending to be a scout from the San Diego Padres calling <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> was drafted in the first round. After getting excited and starting to call his friends he realized it was a hoax.|$|E

25|$|Faldo's {{cause was}} not {{helped by the}} poor {{performances}} of the three most experienced players on the European side, Lee Westwood, Sergio García, and Pádraig Harrington, who failed to win a single match between them. Lee Westwood later criticised Faldo's decision <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> wouldn't be playing in the morning foursomes halfway through his afternoon fourballs match on Friday.|$|E
25|$|Out of all contestants {{that have}} played the game, few {{have been able to}} win the top prize on any {{international}} version of the show. The first was John Carpenter, who won the top prize on the U.S. version on 19 November 1999. Carpenter did not use a lifeline until the final question, using his Phone-a-Friend not for help but to call his father <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> had won the million.|$|E
500|$|The three sculptors {{submitted}} design sketches in mid-February, and on [...] {{met with}} Woolley in New York City to make presentations {{of their work}} and answer his questions. [...] After discussions between Woolley and McAdoo, Weinman was notified on [...] that five of his sketches had been selected—for the dime and half dollar, and the reverse of the quarter. [...] The same day, Woolley wrote to MacNeil <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> would sculpt the quarter's obverse, and to Polasek to inform him of his lack of success. [...] Members of the Commission persuaded Woolley that so much should not be entrusted to a single artist, and MacNeil was allowed to design {{both sides of the}} quarter, subject to the sculptor producing a design satisfactory to Woolley.|$|E

500|$|With Benson's help, Walpole {{had come}} to terms with the loss of his faith. Somerset Walpole, himself the son of an Anglican priest, hoped that his eldest son would follow him into the ministry. Walpole was too {{concerned}} for his father's feelings <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> was no longer a believer, and on graduation from Cambridge in 1906 he took a post as a lay missioner at the Mersey Mission to Seamen in Liverpool. He described that as one of the [...] "greatest failures of my life... The Mission to Seamen was, and is, a splendid institution... but it needs men of a certain type to carry it through and I was not of that type." [...] The head of the mission reprimanded him for lack of commitment to his work, and Walpole resigned after six months.|$|E
2500|$|Mantle was {{assigned}} to the Yankees' Class-D Independence Yankees of the Kansas–Oklahoma–Missouri League, where he played shortstop. During a slump, Mantle called his father <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> wanted to quit baseball. Mutt drove to Independence, Kansas and convinced Mantle to keep playing. Mantle hit [...]313 for the Independence Yankees. [...] Shulthis Stadium, the baseball stadium in Independence where Mantle played, was the site of the first night game in organized baseball. [...] Mantle hit his first professional home run on June 30, 1949 at Shulthis Stadium. The ball went over the center field fence, which was 460 feet.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{perennial}} offensive {{production and}} established fan base in Chicago, the White Sox elected to release Thomas in 2005. Thomas later expressed disappointment with how his 16-year tenure with the White Sox was ended, saying that chairman Jerry Reinsdorf {{did not call}} him <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> wasn’t coming back. He {{also said that he}} and Kenny Williams did not see eye-to-eye after Williams became general manager following the 2000 season. At the time, Thomas was unhappy that his next-to-last deal with the White Sox contained a [...] "diminished skills" [...] clause. He said the White Sox should have traded him after the playoffs that season.|$|E

2500|$|Formed by actor-manager {{and artistic}} {{director}} George Devine, {{the company had}} seen its first three productions flop and urgently needed a success if it was to survive. Devine was prepared to gamble on this play because he saw in it a ferocious and scowling articulation of a new post-war spirit. Osborne was living on a leaky houseboat on the River Thames at the time with Creighton, stewing up nettles from the riverbank to eat. So keen was Devine to contact Osborne that he rowed out to the boat <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> {{would like to make}} the play the fourth production to enter repertory. The play was directed by Tony Richardson and starred Kenneth Haigh, Mary Ure and Alan Bates. It was George Fearon, a part-time press officer at the theatre, who invented the phrase [...] "angry young man". Fearon told Osborne that he disliked the play and feared {{it would be impossible to}} market.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fourth day}} of the {{competition}} had started earlier with another withdrawal, as fifth seed and 2007 Masters Cup semifinalist Andy Roddick announced he was {{pulling out of the}} event, after injuring his ankle during a practice session on the previous day. [...] "Yesterday in the warm-up during practice I just went over on it. [...] We tried the best we could to get it better but I can't really stop and start on it very quickly." [...] commented Roddick. The American's withdrawal allowed 26th-ranked Radek Štěpánek, who accepted the invitation to Shanghai as first alternate, after sixteen players ranked above him, and below last qualifier Gilles Simon, refused to come to the Masters Cup. Roddick said he had called Štěpánek, before deciding not to play, <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> might enter the competition : [...] "I called Štěpánek earlier today to let him know where my head was at, and then just told him when I came off the practice court. So he knew as early as anybody else." [...] Štěpánek's unexpected appearance (Murray had commented [...] "Štěpánek's turned up without his own racquets, he borrowed some socks off me earlier and he hasn't got his contact lenses either") marked the Czech's first career participation to the year-end championships.|$|E
2500|$|While {{serving as}} {{athletic}} director, Bartelme {{was responsible for}} giving Branch Rickey his start in baseball administration. Michigan's baseball coach quit in 1910, and Rickey, who was then a law student at Michigan, applied for the job. Rickey asked every alumnus he had ever met to write letters to Bartelme on his behalf. Bartelme recalled, [...] "Day after day those letters came in." [...] Bartelme was reportedly impressed with Rickey's passion for baseball and his idealism about {{the proper role of}} athletics on a college campus. [...] Bartelme convinced the dean of the law school that Rickey could handle his law studies and serving as the school's baseball coach. [...] Bartelme reportedly called Rickey into his office <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> had the job if only [...] "to put a stop to those damn letters that come in every day." [...] The hiring also marked the beginning of a lifelong friendship and business relationship between Rickey and Bartelme. Bartelme and Rickey worked together for most of the next 35 years, and in 1944 a California newspaper noted: [...] "He and Rickey have had a close association in baseball ever since Bartelme was head of the athletic department of the University of Michigan where Rickey took to baseball just as a means to build up his failing health." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 20, 2017, the day after. The {{opposition}} political party, National Action Party (PAN) {{denounced the}} Mexican {{government to the}} Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for suspicions of violations towards human rights and requested them, to lead an investigation citing such spying causes violations towards the article 16th of the Mexican Constitution, as well as violating article 11th of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. While, {{in response to the}} accusations, Peña Nieto made public that such technology was bought and indeed used by the Mexican government, but he denied misuses, and stated that it was only used to protect Mexicans by searching for criminal by saying he [...] "also felt spied upon, but there was nothing more fake than blaming the (Mexican) government", and that there was [...] "no proof"; saying he ordered the PGR an investigation and that he hoped [...] "under the law, it can be applied against those that have raised false accusations against the government.", with {{the last part of the}} quote making journalist hacking victims feel threatened. Which forced the Mexican president to call writer of the article Azam Ahmed <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> <b>he</b> was not menacing him. However, due to his previous presidential scandals, Peña Nieto words lacked credibility to most Mexicans, with journalist like Jorge Ramos complaining about how Enrique Peña Nieto remains in power despite his illegal actions. Later on the day political rival Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) who competed for the presidency against EPN in 2012 and intends to compete again in 2018 as the candidate from the MORENA political party, was also revealed to be among the hacking targets, with his son also as a target. On June 23, 2017, the National Human Rights Commission (Mexico) opened a case regarding the government espionage.|$|E
2500|$|With Lawry's {{defensive}} leadership {{under heavy}} fire he was dropped {{along with three}} other players, becoming the first Australian captain to be dropped {{in the middle of}} a series. He was not informed privately by the Board and only found out after his axing was made public. The Australian selectors Don Bradman, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey delayed the announcement while they tried to locate Lawry at the end of the Sixth Test, but he had already left for his home in Melbourne and they were unable to find him. He first heard the news on the radio and the selectors were much maligned in the press as a result. Lawry never played for Australia again despite being only 33 and averaging 47.15, but began his 40-year career as a commentator in the Seventh Test, saying [...] "Well, I suppose we all have to get around to it some day". Two days earlier, after lengthy discussion, the ACB had voted 7–6 to acknowledge and respond to Lawry's letter following the South African tour, although their reply did not address Lawry's concerns. His successor Chappell condemned the Board's actions as [...] "unbelievable". Immediately after his appointment, the new leader told his wife [...] "The bastards won't get me the way they got Bill", and he later went out on his own terms. Victorian and Australian teammate Paul Sheahan said [...] "The fact that no-one had the courage <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> was to lose his job as Australian captain was disgraceful." [...] At the same time, Sheahan said that Lawry was [...] "a bit of an autocrat" [...] and [...] "not the sort of captain who stood alongside you and drew the best out of you." ...|$|E

What {{do you mean by}} doing {{something}} like that?", Torrey, who had many Jewish friends, lost his temper and said [...] "You big noisy kike; you can't talk to me like that." [...] Moses attempted to choke him and had to be pulled off Torrey by other members of the committee; he threw a smoking stand at Torrey afterwards.|$|R
