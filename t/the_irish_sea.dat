5|$|Echmarcach's hold on Dublin was {{short-lived}} as the fourteenth-century Annals of Tigernach records that Ímar replaced him as King of Dublin in 1038. This annal-entry {{has been interpreted}} to indicate that Ímar drove Echmarcach from the kingship. There is reason to suspect that Þórfinnr Sigurðarson, Earl of Orkney (died c. 1065) extended his presence into the Isles and <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> region at about this period. The evidence of Þórfinnr's power in the Isles could suggest that he possessed an active interest in the ongoing struggle over the Dublin kingship. In fact, Þórfinnr's predatory operations in <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> region {{may have contributed to}} Echmarcach's loss of Dublin in 1038.|$|E
5|$|The {{catalyst}} for this Norwegian intervention {{may have been}} the extension of Muirchertach's influence into <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> region following the death of Gofraid Crobán, King of the Isles (died 1095). The region itself appears to have degenerated into chaos following Gofraid's demise, and Magnús seems to have taken it upon himself to reassert Norwegian authority. Magnús made two expeditions into <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> region. One arrived in 1098; the other in 1102. The focus of the second overseas operation appears to have been Ireland itself. Following an apparent Norwegian conquest of Dublin, Magnús and Muirchertach negotiated a peace agreement, sealed through the marriage of Magnús' son, Sigurðr (died 1130), and Bjaðmunjo herself.|$|E

40|$|Data are {{provided}} on the long-term average trace metal composition of aerosols collected at two urban (Liverpool and Preston) and one rural (Lancaster) {{site on the}} UK mainland coastal rim of <b>the</b> NE <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea.</b> There are variations in the trace metal composition of aerosols at the urban and rural sites, with evidence of local urban ‘hot spot’ sources of Ni, Zn and Cr.

5|$|Ímar's {{probable}} uncle, Sitriuc, ruled Dublin {{for almost}} fifty years between 989 and 1036. There {{is reason to}} suspect that the latter's realm included Mann by the second or third decade of the eleventh century. His reign in Dublin was finally put to an end by Echmarcach mac Ragnaill (died 1064/1065), who drove Sitriuc from the coastal town and claimed the kingship for himself. Previously, Sitriuc seems to have been closely aligned with Knútr Sveinnsson (died 1035), ruler of the kingdoms of England, Denmark, and Norway. Knútr's apparent authority in <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> region, coupled with Sitriuc's seemingly close connections with him, could account for the remarkable security enjoyed by Sitriuc during Knútr's reign. It is possible that Echmarcach had been bound from taking action against Sitriuc whilst Knútr held power, and that the confusion caused by the latter's death in 1035 enabled Echmarcach to exploit the situation and seize control of <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> region. Although there is no direct evidence that Echmarcach controlled Mann by this date, Sitriuc {{does not appear to have}} taken refuge on the island after his expulsion from Dublin. This seems to suggest that the island was outside Sitriuc's possession, and may indicate that Mann had fallen into the hands of Echmarcach sometime before. In fact, it is possible that Echmarcach used the island to launch his takeover of Dublin.|$|E

40|$|A {{variable}} mesh {{finite element}} model of <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> and Celtic <b>Sea</b> regions with/without {{the inclusion of the}} Mersey estuary is used to examine the influence of grid resolution and the Mersey upon the higher harmonics of the tide in the region. Comparisons are made with observations and published results from finite difference models of the area. Although including a high resolution representation of the Mersey had little effect upon computed tides in <b>the</b> western <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> it had a significant effect upon tidal currents in <b>the</b> eastern <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea.</b> In addition <b>the</b> higher harmonics of the M- 2 tide in near-shore regions of <b>the</b> eastern <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> particularly <b>the</b> Solway and Mersey estuary together with Morecambe Bay showed significant small scale variability. The Mersey was used to test the sensitivity to including estuaries because high resolution accurate topography was available. The results presented here suggest that comparable detailed topographic data sets are required in all estuaries and near-shore regions. In addition comparisons clearly show the need for an unstructured grid model of the region that can include all the estuaries. Such an unstructured grid solution was developed here within a finite element approach, although other methods in particular the finite volume, or coordinate transformations/curvilinear grids and nesting could be applied.

40|$|This report {{considers}} {{the potential for}} storing CO 2 in <b>the</b> East <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> Basin, which lies between the Isle of Man and {{the west coast of}} Cumbria, Lancashire and North Wales. <b>The</b> East <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> Basin has good potential to store CO 2 in the Ormskirk Sandstone (upper Sherwood Sandstone Group), which contains oil and gas fields that prove its ability to store buoyant fluids for millions of years. The Mercia Mudstone Group forms an effective cap rock above the Ormskirk Sandstone. The best potential is likely to be in the larger gas fields such as Morecambe South and North when they are depleted. The calculated CO 2 storage capacity in the oil and gas fields of <b>the</b> East <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> Basin is approximately 1047 million tonnes. Further storage potential may exist in non-hydrocarbon-bearing closed structures in the Ormskirk Sandstone. The total storage capacity of these structures is estimated to be 630 million tonnes. However, the very fact that they do not contain hydrocarbons suggests the possibility that they may not be gas-tight...|$|R
