We were also interested in gender differences. The task required tracing of geometric figures on a template, shown on a tablet screen in light grey, for the segments that make up the target figure, one at a time. This figure-tracing <b>tablet</b> <b>test</b> allows acquisition and automated analysis of four parameters: number of strokes (pen lift) for each segment; oscillations of lines drawn with respect to reference lines; pressure of pen on tablet; and average speed of tracing. The results show a trade-off between speed and quality for the tablet parameters, with higher speed associated with more oscillations with respect to the reference lines, and lower number of strokes for each segment, in both male and female children. The involvement of visual–motor integration on the ability to reduce the oscillations in this <b>tablet</b> <b>test</b> was only seen for the male children, while both the male and female children showed a relationship between oscillations and more general/ abstract visual–spatial processes. These data confirm the role of visual–motor processes in this figure-tracing <b>tablet</b> <b>test</b> only for male children, while more general visual–spatial processes influence the performance in the <b>tablet</b> <b>test</b> for both sexes.

40|$|The {{use of a}} light induced {{fluorescence}} (LIF) {{instrument to}} estimate the total content of fluorescent active pharmaceutical ingredient in a tablet from surface sampling was demonstrated. Different LIF sampling strategies were compared to a total tablet ultraviolet (UV) absorbance test for each tablet. Testing was completed on tablets with triamterene as the active ingredient and on tablets with caffeine as the active ingredient, each {{with a range of}} concentrations. The LIF instrument accurately estimated the active ingredient within 10 % of total <b>tablet</b> <b>test</b> greater than 95 % of the time. The largest error amongst all of the tablets tested was 13 %. The RMSEP between the techniques was in the range of 4. 4 - 7. 9 %. Theory of the error associated with the surface sampling was developed and found to accurately predict the experimental error. This theory uses one empirically determined parameter: the deviation of estimations at different locations on the tablet surface. As this empirical parameter can be found rapidly, correct use of this prediction of error may reduce the effort required for calibration and validation studies of non-destructive surface measurement techniques, and thereby rapidly determine appropriate analytical techniques for estimating content uniformity in tablets.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{bioavailability}} of two formulations of metformin 850 mg tablets: Glucophage® from Merck Santè laboratories (reference product) and Metformin from Winthrop Pharmaceuticals de Colombia SA (test product) in healthy Colombian volunteers. Methods: A random, double blind, two-period, two-week wash out period, crossover study was performed in 24 healthy male and female volunteers for a single 850 -mg dose of metformin tablets administrated with 240 ml of water after 12 hours of fasting. Once the drug was administrated, blood samples were collected before and within 24 hour, and plasma metformin concentration was determined by using a validated HPLC method. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as Cmax, AUC 0 - 96 h, AUC 0 -∞, and Tmax were determined. The formulations were considered bioequivalent if the logarithmic mean ratios of ln-transformed Cmax and AUC 0 -∞ values were within the equivalence range of 80 %- 125 %. Results: ANOVA analysis of the ln-transformed Cmax and AUC 0 -∞ indicated that none of the effects examined (formulation, period, within and between-subjet variances and carry over) was statistically significant. The mean (±SD) of Cmax 1217. 38 (± 251. 72) ng/ml vs. 1305. 25 (± 301. 06) ng/ml, AUC 0 - 96 h 1363. 49 (± 315. 51) ng. h/ml vs. 1584. 82 (± 368. 75) ng. h/ml, AUC 0 -∞, 7155. 75 (± 1440. 74) ng. h/ml vs. 7777. 08 (± 1896. 49) ng. h/ml, and Tmax 2. 57 (± 0. 93) h vs. 2. 22 (± 0. 94) h were obtained with test and reference formulations, respectively. These pharmacokinetic parameters presented differences with the results from other published papers. The 90 % confidence interval of the logarithmic ratio of AUC 0 -∞ and Cmax was within the range of 80 - 125 %. Conclusions: In this study in healthy Colombian volunteers, a single 850 -mg dose of metformin <b>tablet</b> <b>test</b> formulation met the criteria for bioequivalence to the reference formulation based on pharmacokinetic parameters AUC 0 -∞ and Cmax...|$|E
5000|$|The tablet {{has been}} noted for its {{graphics}} performance in games optimized for the Tegra 3, with the water in Riptide GP prompting a description of [...] "awesome". By contrast, file transfer speeds for writing {{were one of the}} slowest in <b>tablets</b> <b>tested.</b> A review unit was rooted in December 2011. Users of the device intending to install a custom ROM themselves were disappointed in January 2012 to discover a locked and encrypted bootloader. The manufacturer promptly announced work on a tool to unlock the bootloader, the use of which will void the warranty and preclude use of DRM content purchased via services such as Google Videos.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} effect of oral administration of lactoferrin (LF) and lactoperoxidase-(LPO-) containing tablet on periodontal condition. Seventy-two individuals with chronic periodontitis {{were randomly assigned to}} take either bovine LF and LPO-containing <b>tablets</b> (<b>test</b> group, n = 37) or control tablets (control group, n = 35) every day for 12 weeks. Periodontal parameters and levels of subgingival plaque bacteria, human and bovine LF, and endotoxin in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were evaluated at baseline, 1 week, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks. Significant differences were observed in GCF levels of bovine LF between the test and control groups throughout the study (P <. 05). However, clinical and bacteriological parameter values proved comparable between the two groups at 1 week to 12 weeks. Therefore, the effect of oral administration of LF and LPO-containing tablets might be weak on periodontal and bacteriological profile in this study...|$|R
40|$|The voltammetric {{behavior}} of Dapsone {{has been carried}} out at carbon paste electrode (CPE) and glassy carbon electrode (GCE) using cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. Dapsone undergoes a well-defined irreversible oxidation peak at both electrodes. The proposed methods were successfully utilized for the determination of Dapsone in various dosage forms without interference from matrix with acceptable precision (RSD < 1. 46 %) and accuracy (RE < 1. 2 %). Forced stability studies of drug in acid, basic and oxidative media were monitored. Moreover, the CPE was used to study the in vitro release of Dapsone <b>tablet,</b> and <b>testing</b> <b>tablet</b> uniformity. The kinetic studies reveals first order with diffusion controlled release. The results compare favorably with data obtained by the official volumetric method...|$|R
40|$|Two fourtreatment {{crossover}} {{studies were}} performed using 12 adult male volunteers in each with seven different commercially available prednisolone tablets. Plasma samples were assayed for prednisolone by a radioimmunoassay method. Statisacal {{analyses of the}} data, by analysis of variance for crossover design (ANOVA), showed no significant differences among the treatment averages {{at any of the}} sampling times except at 0. 25 and 4 hr in one of the studies. There were also no significant differences among the treatment averages for peak plasma level, time of peak plasma level, area 0 – 12 hr, area 0 – 24 hr, and the halflife of elimination of prednisolone. We conclude that the average plasma concentrations of prednisolone are superimposable in a statistical sense and that the <b>tablets</b> <b>tested</b> are bioequivalent. Results of dissolution studies of six tablets of each of the seven lots of prednisolone tablets, using deaerated water in the spin filter apparatus, are presented...|$|R
