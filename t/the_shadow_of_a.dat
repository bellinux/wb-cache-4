25|$|Manchester Corporation had covertly {{been buying}} land for {{building}} the proposed Thirlmere Aqueduct, intended to supply {{water to the}} city. When discovered, it outraged the local community. Thirlmere, close to {{the centre of the}} Lake District, in an area, not only celebrated in the poetry of early conservationist William Wordsworth and fellow Lake poets, but also used as a summer residence by writers, amongst others. In opposition to damming the lake at Thirlmere to form a reservoir, the first environmental group, Thirlmere Defence Association was formed in 1877. It was supported by the national press, Wordsworth’s son and John Ruskin. Caine, incensed at what he perceived as a threat to his beloved Cumbria, joined the movement, initiating a Parliamentary petition. Thirlmere was to be the setting for his novel <b>The</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Crime.|$|E
25|$|In 1961 as Teilifís Éireann {{got ready}} to begin {{broadcasting}} it appointed Hilton Edwards as head of Drama, he was heavily involved in Irish theatre at the time. At this early stage they produced many international and local plays for television audiences such as Antigone, The Wild Duck, The Fire Raisers, The Government Inspector, The Physicists, Martine, The Well of the Saints, Candida, The Man of Destiny, In the Shadow of the Glen, Church Street, The Field, The Plough and the Stars, <b>The</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Gunman and The Hostage. Both of Edwards' successors Jim Fitzgerald and Chloe Gibson would continue with stage play adaptations but would also look for original dramas for television. Hugh Leonard adapted James Joyce's Dubliners under the title Dublin and in 1966 he wrote Insurrection an 8-part real-time series which depicted {{the events of the}} 1916 Easter Rising which was broadcast on Easter Week on the 50th anniversary of the rising, it was RTÉ biggest drama production of the 1960s, involving on location filming and the Army. In its first ten years on the air RTÉ produced 103 plays of which 66% were Irish and 50% began life as stage plays. Half of the drama produced came from serials such as the Dublin based urban soap Tolka Row which began broadcasting in 1964 and finished in 1968. In terms of population RTÉ was one of Europe's biggest producers of television drama.|$|E

500|$|Professor David Harman {{observed}} that Swaminarayan [...] "criticized the popular shakta cults and 'gosai' and 'nath' ascetics for the contemptuous and instrumental {{way in which}} they viewed and treated women. These cults were often responsible for gross sexual abuse of women." [...] Hardiman added that Swaminarayan's view towards women was not in line with this type of misogyny and was rooted in his desire to protect the ill treatment of women along with promoting celibacy for ascetics. Swaminarayan [...] "forbade all sadhus and sadhvis (that is, male and female ascetics) of his sect from having any contact whatsoever with members of the opposite sex." [...] This strict precept was one he likely internalized [...] "after travelling as an ascetic throughout India [...] he was reported to vomit if approached by even <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman". To help his male ascetic followers maintain their vow of celibacy, Swaminarayan taught “the woman who attracts attention is made up of bones, blood vessels, spittle, blood, mucus and feces; she is simply a collection of these things, and there is nothing to be attractive.|$|E
500|$|In 1950 Gibbons {{published}} her Collected Poems, and in {{the same}} year was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Throughout the 1950s she continued, at roughly two-year intervals, to produce [...] politely received novels, none of which created any particular stir. Among these was Fort of the Bear (1953), in which she departed from her familiar London milieu by setting the story largely in the wilder regions of Canada. This was the last of her books handled by Longmans; thereafter her work was published by Hodder and Stoughton. A [...] journey to Austria and Venice in 1953 provided material for her novel <b>The</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Sorcerer (1955). From 1954, having accepted an invitation from Malcolm Muggeridge, the editor of Punch, Gibbons provided frequent contributions to the magazine for the following 15 years. Among these was a science fiction story, [...] "Jane in Space", written in the style of Jane Austen. Gibbons, who wrote the introduction to the 1957 Heritage edition of Sense and Sensibility, was a long-time admirer of Austen, and had described her in a Lady article as [...] "one of the most exquisite" [...] of woman artists.|$|E

500|$|While Wollstonecraft does {{call for}} {{equality}} {{between the sexes}} in particular areas of life, such as morality, she does not explicitly state {{that men and women}} are equal. What she does claim is that men and women are equal in the eyes of God. However, such claims of equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour. Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously writes: [...] "Let it not be concluded that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequently, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God." [...] Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist, particularly since the word and the concept were unavailable to her.|$|E
500|$|Jonah Lomu is {{generally}} regarded as the first true global superstar of rugby union. He was the youngest player ever to appear in a test as an All Black, making his debut at age 19 years, 45 days in 1994. Lomu, a wing, had unique physical gifts; even though he stood 1.96m (6ft 5in) and weighed 119kg (262lb), making him both the tallest and heaviest back ever to play for New Zealand, he could run 100 metres in under 11 seconds. He burst on the international scene in the 1995 Rugby World Cup, scoring seven tries in the competition. Four of those tries came in New Zealand' semifinal win over England, including an iconic try in which he bulldozed England's Mike Catt {{on his way to}} the try line. He added eight more tries in the 1999 Rugby World Cup. Perhaps most remarkably, Lomu played virtually his entire top-level career in <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> serious kidney disorder which ended his test career in 2002 and ultimately led to a transplant in 2004. Even with his career hampered and eventually shortened by his health issues, he scored 37 tries in 63 tests. Lomu was inducted into the World Rugby Hall in October 2011, and was specifically recognised as one of four new inductees [...] "who had left an indelible mark on Rugby World Cup for their moments of magic, inspiration or feats".|$|E
500|$|Prior to the November 15, 2013 {{season opener}} against Southern Vermont College, Williams {{was the number}} one ranked Division III {{basketball}} program in the nation according to the preseason The Sporting News poll, but Williams lost in <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> home court scheduling conflict despite 5–6 shooting by Robinson. Robinson became the only freshman starter in Maker's six-year tenure as head coach at Williams. In his 2013–14 freshman season at Williams, Robinson was twice named New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC) Player of the Week during the regular season. Williams reached the 2014 NCAA Men's Division III Basketball Tournament championship game, but fell 75–73 to University of Wisconsin–Whitewater as Robinson scored 17 points. After Williams took a one-point lead with 4.9 seconds left, Wisconsin pushed the ball upcourt without calling time-out to score the winning basket in what Chris Strauss of USA Today described as the best NCAA basketball tournament game of the weekend. Robinson had posted 30 points in the tournament semifinal against bitter rival Amherst College who had defeated Williams in the season's three previous meetings. Williams finished {{the season with a}} 28–5 record. That season, he led Williams in minutes played (a school record 1,110), points scored (548), three-point shots made (81–179), three-point % (45.3), free throw percentage (87.8%), blocks (36) and steals (36). He averaged 17.1 points, 6.5 rebounds and 34.7 minutes per game. Following the season, he was the NESCAC Rookie of the Year and a Second Team All-NESCAC selection. Robinson became Williams' first freshman to be named All-American (4th team, D3Hoops.com), first D3Hoops.com National Rookie of the Year, first freshman NCAA All-Tournament Team selection and first freshman 500-point scorer. His season was described as [...] "one of the best freshman seasons in Division III men's basketball history" [...] by Jeremy Leveille of WGAM in a story for NHNotebook.com.|$|E
