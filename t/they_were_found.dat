5|$|By contrast, of 393 men {{sentenced to}} death for falling asleep on sentry duty in all theatres in World War I, only two were {{executed}} (sentries were usually posted in pairs to keep one another awake; these two, who served in Mesopotamia, were made an example of because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> sitting asleep together, suggesting that they had colluded).|$|E
5|$|Coal balls may {{be found}} in coal seams across North America and Eurasia. North American coal balls are more widespread, both stratigraphically and geologically, than those in Europe. The oldest known coal balls date from the Namurian stage of the Carboniferous; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> in Germany and on the {{territory}} of former Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|Excavations {{near the}} arch resumed between 1994 and 1996, {{directed}} by Ronny Reich and Yaacov Billig. These have uncovered {{much of the}} debris from {{the collapse of the}} arch. The remains include both stairs from the staircase and stones from its rounded handrails. Some of these are still visible where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>found,</b> at the Jerusalem Archaeological Park now occupying the site.|$|E

50|$|<b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> in {{coniferous}} {{forests and}} woodlands, grasslands, and chaparral. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> {{at sea level}} through altitudes of nearly 2400 m. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> more populous in areas of disturbance than virgin forests. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> burrowing animals and will also use fallen logs, other debris, and patches of grass for cover. The burrows <b>are</b> shallow. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> in moist forests along the coast, but may do well in drier areas.|$|R
5|$|Germanus {{took part}} in the translation, or moving, of the relics of St Ivo to Ramsey in 1001 or the {{following}} year. He and Eadnoth, the abbot of Ramsey, carried the remains of the saint and his recently discovered companions from where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> to Ramsey.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Jesper Milàn {{and colleagues}} {{described}} two coprolites (fossilised faeces) containing fish scales and bones. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> in the Jydegaard Formation, {{the first such}} fossils found in Danish continental Mesozoic deposits. Although the producer of these faeces cannot be identified with certainty, marine turtles and dromaeosaurids such as Dromaeosauroides {{are the most likely}} candidates.|$|E
5|$|Potbelly {{sculpture}}s from Sin Cabezas are stylistically {{related to}} Olmec sculpture but were reused by later peoples, being found in fill {{dating to the}} Late Classic period. The monuments at Sin Cabezas were headless when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> and no fragments of the missing heads were evident, suggesting that they had already been damaged when they were re-erected by later occupants of the site.|$|E

5|$|The Altoona Northern {{initially}} purchased three ex-PRR 2-6-0s (built at Juniata Shops), numbered #101–103. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> to be {{unsuitable for}} the light track and steep grades, and were sold in 1917. They were replaced by #104 and #105, new two-truck Heislers, and the railroad bought #106, a three-truck Heisler, in 1918. They were sold to various lumber companies when the railroad was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The {{media of}} these devices were {{crystals}} with transition metal ion impurities, absorbing low-energy light and re-emitting it in the visible range. By the 1970s, atomic vapors were used in atomic vapor quantum counters for detection of infrared electromagnetic radiation, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> to be superior to the metallic salts and crystals that had been used.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Cold War tensions, the search and rescue {{operations}} of the Soviet Union were not coordinated {{with those of the}} United States, South Korea, and Japan. Consequently no information was shared, and each side endeavored to harass or obtain evidence to implicate the other. The flight data recorders were the key pieces of evidence sought by both governments, with the United States insisting that an independent observer from the ICAO be present on one of its search vessels in the event that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>found.</b> International boundaries are not well defined on the open sea, leading to numerous confrontations between the large number of opposing naval ships that were assembled in the area.|$|E

5|$|Civilian {{telephones}} {{were used}} {{at the outset of}} the war, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> to be unreliable in the damp, muddy conditions that prevailed. Consequently, the field telephone was designed; a device that operated with its own switchboard. Apart from voice communication, it featured a buzzer unit with a Morse code key, so that it could be used to send and receive coded messages. This facility proved useful when, in the midst of bombardment, exploding shells drowned out voice communication. The telephones were connected by lines that sustained continual damage as a result of shell fire and the movement of troops. The lines were generally buried, with redundant lines set in place to compensate for breakages.|$|E
5|$|Conditions in {{the casual}} wards were worse {{than in the}} {{relieving}} rooms and deliberately designed to discourage vagrants, who were considered potential trouble-makers and probably disease-ridden. Vagrants who presented themselves {{at the door of}} a workhouse were {{at the mercy of the}} porter, whose decision it was whether or not to allocate them a bed for the night in the casual ward. Those refused entry risked being sentenced to two weeks of hard labour if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> begging or sleeping in the open and prosecuted for an offence under the Vagrancy Act 1824.|$|E
5|$|Laura and L. D. {{were taken}} to a bridge over the North Canadian River, six miles west and one mile south of Okemah. The bridge was {{described}} as on the old Schoolton road and at Yarbrough's crossing. According to the Associated Press and The Crisis, Laura was raped. The Ledger reported that the men gagged Laura and L. D. with tow sacks and, using rope made of half-inch hemp tied in a hangman's knot, hanged them from the bridge. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> in the morning hanging 20ft below the middle span. A local resident, John Earnest, reported the discovery to the sheriff's office.|$|E

50|$|The Regal Angelfish {{is widely}} {{distributed}} throughout the Indo-Pacific. The species can <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in the Red Sea and East Africa to the Tuamoto Islands. <b>They</b> can <b>be</b> <b>found</b> northward to the Ryukyu Islands(Japan). <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> by Ogasawara islands(Japan) as well. <b>They</b> can <b>be</b> <b>found</b> south to New Caledonia (France) and the great Barrier Reef. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> to <b>be</b> widely distributed around coral reefs in Taiwan. Recent research however, indicates that the genus Pygoplites comprises two morphs. The two variants may hybridize at Christmas Island.|$|R
5|$|Nevertheless, {{three out}} of the serial's twelve episodes have been recovered. 16mm copies of episodes 5 and 10 were {{returned}} in the early 1980s, under unclear circumstances (with rumour claiming <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> {{in the basement of}} a Mormon church). Episode 2 was returned in 2004 by former BBC engineer Francis Watson. He had come across the film in the 1970s, while clearing a projector testing room at the BBC's Ealing Studios. Instead of disposing of the film as instructed, he brought it home – eventually to return it to the Corporation when he realised the value of the material.|$|E
5|$|On 19 January 1939, {{test pilot}} Kapetan Milan Pokorni put the {{prototype}} into a steep dive. When he reached , the windscreen {{detached from the}} aircraft; Pokorni pulled up hard and the strain broke off half of the starboard wing. The aircraft crashed, and Pokorni was killed. An inquiry determined that modifications to the windscreen had contributed to the accident but the main factor had been the pilot's handling of the highly sensitive controls. Engineers recalculated the stress factors on the airframe and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> to be safe; the crash was attributed to pilot error and {{the sensitivity of the}} controls.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 7 March 1997, Sylvia Sheils and Mary Callinan were found dead in No.1 Orchard View, Grangegorman, Dublin 7. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> by Ann Mernagh, another {{resident}} of the house, who raised the alarm at No.5 Orchard View. The house was a two story end of terrace house owned by the Eastern Health Board, and was used to provide sheltered accommodation for outpatients of St Brendan's Psychiatric Hospital. The entire Orchard View area was completely demolished 15 years after the murders and is now an empty plot surrounded by a wall.|$|E

5|$|The defense {{maintained}} that the evidence against Desha was largely circumstantial. They said that Desha's personal items {{could easily have been}} planted where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>found.</b> They pointed out that, despite the stab wounds on Baker's body, no blood was found on the ground near the road or on the path along which the murderer had dragged the body to conceal it. Finally, they contended that, although the days had been unusually warm and wild boars were known to inhabit the area, Baker's body showed no obvious signs of decomposition or disturbance by animals, as might have been expected had it been there for six days, as the prosecution had charged.|$|E
5|$|The ten colossal heads from San Lorenzo {{originally}} formed two roughly {{parallel lines}} running north-south across the site. Although some were recovered from ravines, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> {{close to their}} original placements and had been buried by local erosion. These heads, together {{with a number of}} monumental stone thrones, probably formed a processional route across the site, powerfully displaying its dynastic history. Two of the San Lorenzo heads had been re-carved from older thrones.|$|E
5|$|Under this {{sycamore}} tree at Tolpuddle in Dorset, England, six agricultural labourers, {{known as}} the Tolpuddle Martyrs, formed an early trades union in 1834. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> to have breached the Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797 and were transported to Australia. The subsequent public outcry led to their release and return. The tree now has a girth of 5.9 metres (19 feet, 4 inches) and a 2005 study dated the tree to 1680. The tree is cared for by the National Trust, who have pollarded the tree in 2002 and 2014.|$|E
