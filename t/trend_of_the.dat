5|$|A {{number of}} {{landmark}} structures, particularly in Oslo, {{were built in}} the functionalist style, the first one being the Skansen restaurant (1925–1927) by Lars Backer, demolished in 1970. Backer also designed the restaurant at Ekeberg, opened in 1929. The art gallery Kunstnernes Hus by Gudolf Blakstad and Herman Munthe-Kaas (1930) still shows influence from the preceding classicist <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1920s. Hvalstrand bath (1934) is one of several public seaside bath facilities in Norway, by André Peters. A year before, Ingierstrand Bad was designed by Ole Lind Schistad (1891-1979) and Eivind Moestue(1893 -1977). Other great names of Norwegian functionalist architecture are Ove Bang, Fridtjof Reppen, Nicolai Beer (1885-1950) and Per Grieg (1897-1962).|$|E

5|$|A {{promethium}} atom has 61 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 4f56s2. In forming compounds, the atom loses its two outermost electrons {{and one of}} the 4f-electrons, which belongs to an open subshell.

5|$|As of 2016, the {{black-necked grebe}} is {{classified}} as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population is uncertain, as some populations are decreasing, whereas others are stable, have an uncertain trend, or are increasing. The justification for the current classification of this species is its very large population (estimated around 3.9–4.2 million individuals) combined with a large estimated extent of occurrence (about 155 million km2 (60 million sq mi)). This grebe {{is probably the most}} numerous grebe in the world.|$|E
5|$|Neither can the oblique <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drapery, belt-high in the {{silhouette}} (in profile) of the elder, be explained … without accepting {{that she was}} seated, her left forearm resting on her thigh. Only thus could the dice be handled. Only thus, moreover, can so extreme a slope in the pleats coming away from the shoulder, pleats {{that would have to}} fall vertically in a non-seated figure, become understandable. On the right, let it not be readily forgotten that all the pleats turn strongly forward, so that they pass the centerline of the stele, marked by the high, triumphant flower and the mingled group of hands. For the maiden on the left, although the cascade of pleats is generally much more direct—as appropriate to a standing posture—some of them, curiously arched, turn forward as well, for example at the left armhole. They can scarcely be understood without again invoking the supporting effect produced by the leg of the seated woman. The folds of Kore’s sleeve, which in 1939 I drew a little too short in the descent, carry on to Demeter’s lap, where they spread out.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the history}} of fabric {{production}} natural dyes {{have been used to}} apply a form of colour, with dyes from plants, including indigo from Woad, having dozens of compounds whose proportions may vary according to soil type and climate; therefore giving rise to variations in shade. In the case of the Saltire, variations in shades of blue have resulted in the background of the flag ranging from sky blue to navy blue. When incorporated as part of the Union Flag during the 17th century, the dark blue applied to Union Flags destined for maritime use was possibly {{selected on the basis of}} the durability of darker dyes, with this dark blue shade eventually becoming standard on Union Flags both at sea and on land. Some flag manufacturers selected the same navy blue colour <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union Flag for the Saltire itself, leading to a variety of shades of blue being depicted on the flag of Scotland.|$|E
