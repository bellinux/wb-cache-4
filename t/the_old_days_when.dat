An aging eccentric, Firs {{considers}} the emancipation of the Russian serfs a disaster, and talks nostalgically of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> everybody admired their masters and owners, such as Gayev's parents and grandparents. His senility {{is a source}} of much of the play's poignancy, symbolizing the decay of the old order into muttering madness.|$|E
25|$|The {{tourists}} flew to Sydney, where Mike Denness {{held a press}} conference, then flew on to Adelaide for net {{practice and}} their first matches. Here they also saw Dennis Lillee in his first match since his breakdown in 1973, taking 4/82 and 3/40 for Western Australia against South Australia. Frank Tyson noted that the tour was far more hectic than <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> the team arrived by boat. Instead of having seven first class matches and a similar number of country matches before the First Test they now only had four first class matches, and few of the England players had time to accustom themselves to local conditions. Most of the party only had two games under their belt when they played Australia at the Gabba. Also the country games were no longer two-day occasions for relaxation, but were crammed into a 10-hour, one-day flying visit, which allowed little time to be feted by the locals or for the players to rest.|$|E

[...] Later the other daughter died. [...] Wooden Leg then adopted his grandnephew, Joseph White Wolf, and brought him up as his own. [...] The story ends with Wooden Leg {{an old man who}} is increasingly unable to farm his land. [...] But he is well off compared to most Cheyennes, as he had a pension from his scouting days and his pay as a judge. [...] He appreciates the comfortable life he now has but thinks much about <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> [...] "every man had to be brave".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{showed the}} unwillingness of Sisko to accept his {{position}} as a religious figure within the Bajoran culture. [...] This theme was first explored in [...] "Emissary", the pilot of the series. The ongoing theme for Bajoran politics and religion began with [...] "In the Hands of the Prophets" [...] and ran {{through the rest of}} the series. Wolfe was raised as a Catholic, and he attributes the religious theme of the episode to this influence, as well as his interest in history. [...] He compares the religious intrigue of the story to the history of Catholicism in the 15th and 16th century, a time when members of various families jostled for power to become Pope. When asked to describe the character of Winn, Louise Fletcher said, [...] "Think the Pope in space, except she's like an ancient Pope, from <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> Popes were ruthless and powerful and exerted their powers and fought wars and did all kinds of naughty things." ...|$|E
500|$|Irwin {{managed the}} Rochester Hustlers between 1918 and 1920. Rochester was not {{successful}} under Irwin; the 1920 Hustlers finished with 45 wins and 106 losses. Cray L. Remington of the Rochester Evening Journal later wrote, [...] "Local fans used to pan Arthur Irwin in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> Arthur was as innocent of wrong {{as the little}} sparrows on the limbs. Arthur's job was to win ball games minus talent. He couldn't do it." [...] While managing the Eastern League's Hartford Senators in 1921 against a New York semi-pro team, Irwin noticed the play of Lou Gehrig and convinced him to sign his first professional contract with Hartford. Gehrig had already committed to play at Columbia University and professional experience would affect his collegiate eligibility, so he began playing for Hartford using assumed names like Lou Lewis. However, Columbia found out about Gehrig's play and the slugger was forced to sit out of college baseball for a year.|$|E
500|$|Lukather {{achieved}} notability in the 1970s and 1980s {{as one of}} {{the most}} sought-after session guitarists in Los Angeles, playing with a wide range of artists from Aretha Franklin to Warren Zevon. He has performed on over 1,500 records spanning 36years. Music journalist Jude Gold noted, [...] "It's hard to name a guitarist who has had a more prolific and fulfilling career than Steve Lukather." [...] Lukather credits fellow Toto members David Paich and Jeff Porcaro for getting him exposure in the industry—although he lamented in an April 2011 interview that opportunities for session musicians have curtailed in recent years: [...] "There is no 'session guy' thing any more—not like it was. It's not like <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> I was doing 25 sessions a week. All the studios are gone. The budgets are gone. The record companies are all gone." [...] His own output as a session musician has slowed along with the rest of the industry—as of 2009, Lukather stated he was only doing a few sessions a year.|$|E

500|$|In Shuffle! Essence+, {{there are}} four new storylines {{available}} in the game. Tsubomi is Kareha's younger sister, and like Kareha, she {{has a tendency to}} space out when she see something romantic or cute. Her catchphrase is [...] "Kya! Kya! Kya!". She's the same age as Primula, so they easily become friends. Sakura is Rin's and Kaede's childhood friend, they know each other since elementary school. That's why she knows about Rin's and Kaede's tragic past. Nadeshiko is Rin's homeroom teacher. She's quite self-confident, firmly stepping on the ground, single, attractive and is frequently the victim of pickup lines, including from the Lord of Devils and Itsuki. It appears she has some martial arts training (being able to slice a bottle with her bare hand). She has a habit of dealing out very strong punishments such as writing 100-page reports and dragging a tire around the track for minor offenses. However when it comes speak about romantic relationship or cuteness she can become shy, specially when someone speaks so about her. Daisy is Sia's cousin. When they were kids they used to play a lot together, but because of some circumstances between their fathers both of them stopped playing together. Daisy remember the precious for her time she spend with Lisianthus, but Sia seems to forgotten <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> <b>when</b> they were together.|$|E
