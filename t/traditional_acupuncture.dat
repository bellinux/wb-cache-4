A comparison of {{the average number of}} patients treated per hour found significant differences between China (10) and the United States (1.2). Chinese herbs are often used. There is a diverse range of acupuncture approaches, involving different philosophies. Although various different techniques of acupuncture practice have emerged, the method used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) seems to be the most widely adopted in the US. <b>Traditional</b> <b>acupuncture</b> involves needle insertion, moxibustion, and cupping therapy, and may be accompanied by other procedures such as feeling the pulse {{and other parts of the}} body and examining the tongue. <b>Traditional</b> <b>acupuncture</b> involves the belief that a [...] "life force" [...] (qi) circulates within the body in lines called meridians. The main methods practiced in the UK are TCM and Western medical acupuncture. The term Western medical acupuncture is used to indicate an adaptation of TCM-based acupuncture which focuses less on TCM. The Western medical acupuncture approach involves using acupuncture after a medical diagnosis. Limited research has compared the contrasting acupuncture systems used in various countries for determining different acupuncture points and thus there is no defined standard for acupuncture points.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>traditional</b> <b>acupuncture,</b> the {{acupuncturist}} decides which {{points to}} treat by observing and questioning {{the patient to}} make a diagnosis according to the tradition used. In TCM, the four diagnostic methods are: inspection, auscultation and olfaction, inquiring, and palpation. Inspection focuses on the face and particularly on the tongue, including analysis of the tongue size, shape, tension, color and coating, and the absence or presence of teeth marks around the edge. Auscultation and olfaction involve listening for particular sounds such as wheezing, and observing body odor. Inquiring involves focusing on the [...] "seven inquiries": chills and fever; perspiration; appetite, thirst and taste; defecation and urination; pain; sleep; and menses and leukorrhea. Palpation is focusing on feeling the body for tender [...] "A-shi" [...] points and feeling the pulse.|$|E
2500|$|Acupuncturists are not {{a nationally}} {{regulated}} profession in the United Kingdom. Acupuncture practice is regulated by law in England and Wales for health and safety criteria under The Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982, which has been recently amended by the Local Government Act 2003. Each local authority implements its own policy {{in accordance with the}} Act. For example, the London boroughs use the London Local Authorities Act, 1991/2000. Premises and each practitioner offering acupuncture must be licensed. As there is no formal certification of acupuncture, practitioners are exempted from licensing by virtue of being current members of approved acupuncture associations such as the British Acupuncture Council. Physiotherapists are also required to be current members of an approved acupuncture association as body piercing {{is not part of the}} entry level curriculum for state registered physiotherapists regulated by the Health Professions Council. The approved acupuncture organisations have rigorous codes of practice and educational requirements and members are covered by the appropriate indemnity insurance. [...] An estimated 7,500 practitioners practise acupuncture to some extent and belong to a relevant professional or regulatory body. About 2,400 are traditional acupuncturists who mostly belong to the British Acupuncture Council, which requires its members to be trained in both <b>traditional</b> <b>acupuncture</b> and relevant biomedical sciences. Approximately 2,200 registered doctors and other statutorily regulated health professionals belong to the British Medical Acupuncture Society. Some 2,650 physiotherapists belong to the Acupuncture Association of Chartered Physiotherapists and 250 nurses belong to the British Academy of Western Acupuncture. There are also practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine who belong to one or more associations.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{intrinsic}} linkage between <b>traditional</b> time-varied <b>acupuncture</b> and Zhou Yi(The Book of Changes) philosophy. It {{is suggested that}} the develpoment of <b>traditional</b> time-varied <b>acupuncture</b> methods such as Heavenly stem-prescription of point selection, Earthly branch-prescription of point selection, Point selection method of engendering among the five phases, Eight methods of intelligent turtle and Method of eight flight were all affected by the image-numberology mathematical theories of Zhou Yi study. Under the guidance of Zhou Yi philosophy, the theories of Yin-Yang, Five phases, Heavenly stems and Earthly Branches, and Nine-palaces and Eight-winds in Zhou Yi study {{were associated with the}} concepts of the unity between nature and human beings and the circulating period of Qixue inside the meridians in 'Yellow Emperor’s Canon of Medicine' closely, thus the thinking mode in Zhou Yi study became the main basic principles for building up the fundamental theories and specific methods of <b>traditional</b> time-varied <b>acupuncture.</b> The changes of Yin-Yang and Five phases were used to calculate the circulating period of Qi and blood inside the meridians and select the corresponding points for each specific time, so that the theoretical principles of <b>traditional</b> time-varied <b>acupuncture</b> were systematized and embodied. All these obviously reflect the influence of Zhou Yi philosophy on the formation of <b>traditional</b> time-varied <b>acupuncture</b> methods. 本文探討了傳統時間針法與易學之間的內在聯系,認為子午流注納甲法、納子(支) 法、養子時刻注穴法、靈龜八法和飛騰八法等傳統時間針法的形成是在易學象數學說的指導下,把《黃帝內經》中有關人與天地相參、經脈氣血流注、針刺須候氣逢時等學說與陰陽五行、天干地支、九宮八卦等結合在一起,以陰陽五行的生克變化來推算人體氣血的開闔和所相應的經脈穴位,從而將按時刺灸的理論原則加以系統化和具體化,充分體現了易學的哲學思維方式對傳統時間針法形成和構建的影響...|$|R

2500|$|A 2013 {{systematic}} review found that acupuncture may be effective for nonspecific lower back pain, but the authors noted there were limitations {{in the studies}} examined, such as heterogeneity in study characteristics and low methodological quality in many studies. A 2012 {{systematic review}} found some supporting evidence that acupuncture was more effective than no treatment for chronic non-specific low back pain; the evidence was conflicting comparing the effectiveness over other treatment approaches. A 2011 systematic review of systematic reviews found that [...] "for chronic low back pain, individualized acupuncture is not better in reducing symptoms than formula acupuncture or sham acupuncture with a toothpick that does not penetrate the skin." [...] A 2010 review found that sham acupuncture was as effective as real acupuncture for chronic low back pain. The specific therapeutic effects of acupuncture were small, whereas its clinically relevant benefits were mostly due to contextual and psychosocial circumstances. Brain imaging {{studies have shown that}} <b>traditional</b> <b>acupuncture</b> and sham acupuncture differ in their effect on limbic structures, {{while at the same time}} showed equivalent analgesic effects. A 2005 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against either acupuncture or dry needling for acute low back pain. The same review found low quality evidence for pain relief and improvement compared to no treatment or sham therapy for chronic low back pain only in the short term immediately after treatment. The same review also found that acupuncture is not more effective than conventional therapy and other alternative medicine treatments. A 2017 systematic review for an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline found low to moderate evidence that acupuncture was effective for chronic low back pain, and limited evidence that it was effective for acute low back pain. The same review found that the strength of the evidence for both conditions was low to moderate. Another 2017 clinical practice guideline, this one produced by the Danish Health Authority, recommended against acupuncture for both recent-onset low back pain and lumbar radiculopathy.|$|E

40|$|Background Acupuncture is {{commonly}} used to treat chronic sinusitis, though there is little documentation on the effect. This study presents the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes in a trial comparing <b>traditional</b> Chinese <b>acupuncture,</b> sham acupuncture, and conventional treatment for chronic sinusitis. Findings In a three-armed single blind randomized controlled study, we recruited 65 patients with symptoms of sinusitis > 3 months and signs of sinusitis on computed tomography (CT). Patients were randomized {{to one of three}} study arms: (1) 2 – 4 weeks of medication with antibiotics, corticosteroids, 0. 9 % sodium chloride solution, and local decongestants (n = 21), (2) ten treatments with <b>traditional</b> Chinese <b>acupuncture</b> (n = 25), or (3) ten treatments with minimal acupuncture at non-acupoints (n = 19). Change in HRQoL was assessed over 12 weeks using the Chronic Sinusitis Survey (CSS) and Short form 36 (SF- 36) questionnaires. In the study, we found only a non-significant difference on the CSS symptom scale between conventional medical therapy and <b>traditional</b> Chinese <b>acupuncture.</b> On the SF- 36 scale role-physical the change was larger in the conventional group than in the sham group (p = 0. 02), and on the mental health scale the change in the conventional therapy arm was larger than in the <b>traditional</b> Chinese <b>acupuncture</b> group (p = 0. 03). There was no difference in effect on HRQoL on any scale between the sham and <b>traditional</b> Chinese <b>acupuncture</b> groups. Conclusion There was no clear evidence of the superiority of one treatment over another on short-term HRQoL outcomes, although there was a statistically non-significant advantage of conventional therapy in a few dimensions...|$|R

50|$|Originating from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), FSN {{does not}} follow the rules and {{principles}} of TCM and the chosen insertion points do not coincide with <b>traditional</b> <b>acupuncture</b> points.
