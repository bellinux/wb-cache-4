40|$|<b>Trusteeship</b> <b>Territory</b> of Tanganyika, and the Colony and Pro-tectorate of Kenya. These three territories {{constitute}} an area which {{is bounded in}} the north by the Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia; in the west by the Belgian Congo; in the south by Nvasaland and Portuguese East Africa and in the East by the ~nhian Ocean. In total the three countries have an area of about 681, 000 square miles and a population of over twenty million people. One feature of the East African scene which is of fundamental importance is its considerable diversity, and a recognition of this is essential to a proper understanding of the statistical data. Over the years Kenya has come to acquire a position of economic leadership in East Africa. The reasons for this are partly historical and partly geographical. The growth of Nairobi as a political and commercial centre for the whole region, the development of Mombasa as the principal port, and the relatively large and compact area of European settle-ment with climatic conditions making possible a development of mixed farming, have all combined to give the Kenya economy characteristics which are not shown by either {{of the other two}} territories. Kenya provides an important distributive link with the outside world for the whole of Uganda and for a large part of northern Tanganyika, and along with the expansion of coln-mercial activity which this has brought into being there has also been a significant growth in secondary manufacturing 'The bracketed numerals ro be found in the tcsr refer to tlic numbered items in thc bibliography, bur nor all rhc items 3 rC indicated, smrc nnny of rhrm arc of s sencr;tl char~orer.

40|$|This paper {{assumes that}} {{language}} and educational policies are {{manifestations of the}} interdependence between linguistic thought and the prevailing zeitgeist, and hence that an investigation of these policies from an historical perspective falls squarely within the history of linguistics. The policies discussed here are those by the British and French, as pursued in their League of Nations Mandates and later their UN <b>Trusteeship</b> <b>Territories</b> in Africa. A contrastive look at their policies – as revealed in historical documents – yields insights into the philosophical and political discourse of that period and sheds light on the competing dominant positions in this discourse, {{as well as on}} the views of language expressed in it...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} problem is {{an analysis of}} the political evolution of Cameroon from a colony in 1884 to an independent state in 1961. It involves not only the transition of the country from a colony to an independent state per se, but also the various factors which kindled the rise of nationalism in the country. The problem is rendered more interesting and complex {{by the fact that the}} country had, at different times in its colonial history, been a German colony, as well as British and French colonies – although technically Britain and France administered their respective portions of the country first as mandates of the League of Nations and then as <b>trusteeship</b> <b>territories</b> of the United Nations Organization. In order to study the problem, {{an analysis of the}} political and economic policies of the colonizing powers in the country is imperative, since they were the determining factors which conditioned the country’s political destiny until 1961...|$|R

In 1936, the acquired territory, dubbed Italian Somaliland, was integrated into Africa Orientale Italiana {{as part of the}} Italian Empire. This would last until 1941, during World War II.

While the Netherlands' traditional Western allies—the United States, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand—were sympathetic to Dutch policy, they were unwilling to provide any military support {{in the event of}} conflict with Indonesia. On 26 September 1961, the Dutch Foreign Minister Joseph Luns offered to hand over West New Guinea to a United Nations trusteeship. This proposal was firmly rejected by his Indonesian counterpart Subandrio, who likened the West New Guinea dispute to Katanga's attempted secession from the Republic of Congo during the Congo Crisis. By October 1961, Britain was open to transferring West New Guinea to Indonesia while the United States floated the idea of a jointly-administered <b>trusteeship</b> over the <b>territory.</b>|$|R
