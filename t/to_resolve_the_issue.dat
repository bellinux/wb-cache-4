5|$|The Air Commando sergeants, James J. Stanford and Charles Larimore Jones {{discovered}} the problem, obtained manuals on forward air control {{and went to}} work <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> In short order, they arranged rides in Air America and Continental Air Services aircraft and began marking ground targets. The expedient worked and the sergeants, using radio call sign Butterfly, succeeded brilliantly.|$|E
5|$|These {{allegations}} {{were brought to}} the attention of the Ethics Education Committee of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology (SVP) in 2007, and a response was given in 2008. In regard to Redondasuchus, the SVP found no plagiarism involved, while in the case of Heliocanthus and Rioarribasuchus, the SVP did not try <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{an effect}} of Waddington's intervention, Romania also agreed <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of Jewish Emancipation. The {{government}} pledged itself to naturalize all of its non-Christian residents (see History of the Jews in Romania). Kogălniceanu himself made efforts to overturn this decision, and was bitter when the Germans refused to compromise. The resolution was debated inside Romania over the following year, and such a measure in respect to Jews was not introduced until 1922–1923.|$|E

5|$|Blackwell's son and {{approximately}} 50 other children boycotted the school, {{because of its}} decision to not let the children wear the SNCC freedom pins. As a result, Blackwell and some other activists in the community {{decided that it was}} vital to school those children. She helped open freedom schools in Issaquena County, <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> The schools became popular and continued to teach classes every summer until 1970, when the local schools finally desegregated.|$|E
5|$|The European Ombudsman {{is elected}} by the Parliament, who deals with public {{complaints}} against all institutions. Petitions can also be brought forward by any EU citizen on a matter within the EU's sphere of activities. The Committee on Petitions hears cases, some 1500 each year, sometimes presented by the citizen themselves at the Parliament.

5|$|The {{reason for}} the Czech {{invasion}} in 1919 was primarily the organisation of elections to the Sejm (parliament) of Poland in the disputed area. The elections were {{to be held in}} the whole of Cieszyn Silesia. The Czechs claimed that the polls must not be held in the disputed area as the delimitation was only interim and no sovereign rule should be executed there by any party. When the Czech demand was rejected by the Poles, the Czechs decided <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> by force.|$|E

50|$|The {{process for}} {{constitutional}} amendments is slightly more tangled: {{the rule is}} to require a three fifths (60%) of both houses, but if the senate does not achieve such a supermajority and a mixed congress-senate committee fails <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues,</b> <b>the</b> congress may force the amendment through with a two-thirds vote as long as an absolute majority of the senate was in favour.|$|R
5|$|Khrushchev's U.S. visit {{resulted}} in an informal agreement with U.S. president Dwight Eisenhower {{that there would be}} no firm deadline over Berlin, but that there would be a four-power summit to try <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> and the premier left the U.S. to general good feelings. Khrushchev returned from the U.S. convinced that he had achieved a strong personal relationship with Eisenhower (who in fact was unimpressed by the Soviet leader) and that he could achieve détente with the Americans. He pushed for an immediate summit, but was frustrated by French President Charles de Gaulle, who postponed it until 1960, a year in which Eisenhower was scheduled to pay a return visit to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|During the 1790s, {{politicians}} and land speculators in Georgia perpetrated fraudulent and corrupt land sales {{in an area}} that is now a large portion of Alabama and Mississippi. When the fraud was exposed in 1795, there was significant public outcry, and the Georgia legislation authorizing the sales was repealed. This led to a host of claims and litigation, since in a number of cases, land was afterward resold to unsuspecting third parties. President Jefferson eventually established a three-person commission to resolve conflicting claims arising from the fraud. Lincoln was appointed to this commission, which developed legislation <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> Eventually approved by Congress, Georgia's claims to the area were extinguished and some land was reserved to resolve other outstanding claims. The commission was also responsible for documenting and reporting on {{the nature and extent of}} the fraud, activities in which Lincoln was heavily involved.|$|E
5|$|The {{rapid release}} of Przemysł II {{could have been}} aided by the {{intervention}} of Leszek II the Black and Mestwin II of Pomerelia. The reason {{for the arrival of}} Mestwin II to Greater Poland, in addition to helping his imprisoned ally, was to settle the claims of the Teutonic Order over parts of Pomerelia and <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of succession after his own death; from his first marriage, Mestwin II had only two daughters, Catherine and Euphemia. The situation was further {{complicated by the fact that}} Mestwin II gained the rule over all the Duchy of Pomerelia after a war against his uncles, Racibor and Sambor II, who in revenge for this willed his possessions (including Białogard and Gniew) to the Teutonic Order upon his death in 1278.|$|E

5|$|Wesley, aware the Enterprise is in orbit, {{arranges}} for {{the children}} to passively resist. When the Aldeans request Picard's help <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> with the children, the crew finds a way to beam through the shield, allowing Commander Riker and Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) to sneak onto the planet. Data manages to disable the Custodian, disrupting the Aldean's transporter and planetary shield. Dr. Crusher explains to the Aldeans that their shield has weakened the ozone layer of their planet, exposing the inhabitants to ultraviolet radiation that has left them unable to bear children. The radiation would likely have the same effects on the children from the Enterprise. Without the planetary shield, the ozone layer will naturally return, allowing the Aldeans to reproduce again. The Aldeans recognize the error of their ways and return the children to the Enterprise. They accept Starfleet's help to correct their ancient systems and recognize that they will have to forgo their invisibility to continue their society.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey long faced {{opposition}} from {{some members of}} his cathedral chapter led by Henry Marshal, Burchard du Puiset, and Roger of London. They objected to his having given {{a large part of}} York's treasury toward Richard's ransom, and to some of his appointments in the church of York. Charges of simony, extortion, and neglect of his duties were lodged against Geoffrey, who in return excommunicated the ringleaders more than once, and locked the canons out of church. Geoffrey also faced difficulties with his appointees to the office of Dean of York; his first choice, his half-brother Peter, was opposed by the cathedral chapter. Geoffrey's second choice, Simon of Apulia, the chancellor of York, refused to give up the office when Geoffrey decided to award it to a third man, Philip of Poitou. Simon was supported by the cathedral chapter, who elected him to the office despite Geoffrey's opposition. An appeal was made to the papacy by Geoffrey while Simon travelled to King Richard in Germany. The king refused to allow the appeal and tried to summon Geoffrey to Germany <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> Geoffrey was unable to leave York because of disturbances within the cathedral clergy, and Simon managed to secure papal confirmation as Dean of York.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Jackson {{was accused}} {{of child sexual abuse}} by Evan Chandler, on behalf of his then-13-year-old child, Jordan Chandler. To the father's disapproval and concern, his son had become friends with the {{musician}} in May 1992. Allegedly under the influence of a controversial sedative administered by Evan Chandler, a dentist, his son said that Jackson had touched his penis. Evan Chandler was tape-recorded threatening to damage the singer's music career, and engaged Jackson in unsuccessful negotiations <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> with a financial settlement. Jordan Chandler then told a psychiatrist and later police that he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and oral sex. Jackson settled a civil suit out of court with the Chandler family and their legal team for $22,000,000 in January 1994. After Jordan Chandler refused to testify in the criminal proceedings, the state closed its criminal investigation citing lack of evidence, and Jackson was not charged with a crime. Jordan Chandler later admitted to lying. After Jackson's death, Evan Chandler committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|In August 2014, it was {{announced}} that VyRT would exclusively broadcast worldwide the performance scheduled on September 15 at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. Sales for digital tickets began on September 3. VyRT provided access to several different experience packages featuring backstage interactivity with both bands and exclusive content. On September 15, before Thirty Seconds to Mars took to the stage, the VyRT platform was hacked and was a victim of a piracy. Jared Leto, founder of the streaming service, was forced to delay the performance by Thirty Seconds to Mars by an hour <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> The audience eventually lost approximately three minutes of actual stage time, but the set list was shortened. The event included real-time social community engagement from audiences worldwide. A second broadcast of the show was later scheduled for September 17, 2014. The performance by Thirty Seconds to Mars became commercially available for download in October 2014 through VyRT. Footage recorded during the Carnivores Tour was uploaded to Linkin Park's official YouTube account.|$|E
5|$|When lasers {{were first}} invented, laser speckle was {{considered}} to be a severe drawback in using lasers to illuminate objects, particularly in holographic imaging because of the grainy image produced. It was later realized that speckle patterns could carry information about the object's surface deformations. Butters and Leendertz developed the technique of speckle pattern interferometry in 1970, and since then, speckle has been exploited in a variety of other applications. A photograph is made of the speckle pattern before deformation, and a second photograph is made of the speckle pattern after deformation. Digital subtraction of the two images results in a correlation fringe pattern, where the fringes represent lines of equal deformation. Short laser pulses in the nanosecond range can be used to capture very fast transient events. A phase problem exists: In the absence of other information, one cannot tell the difference between contour lines indicating a peak versus contour lines indicating a trough. <b>To</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of phase ambiguity, ESPI may be combined with phase shifting methods.|$|E
5|$|The race, {{the sixth}} of the season, began at 3:30p.m. EST, and was {{televised}} {{live in the}} United States on ABC. Scott Dixon held his lead from pole position, with Will Power behind him. Justin Wilson made light contact with a wall during the first lap of the race, and pitted shortly after due to a flat right-rear tire. The team discovered additional damage to the suspension that required lengthy repairs, but {{he was able to}} return to the race. During the fifth lap, some teams reported that parts of the track were deteriorating, but it was not felt that any action needed to be taken. Three laps later, Rubens Barrichello, who had gained four places started suffering mechanical problems, which forced him to retire from the race after eleven laps. Wilson set the fastest lap of the race during the ninth lap, completing a circuit in 1 minute 12.0651 seconds. On lap 10, Ryan Hunter-Reay blocked Ryan Briscoe from passing him, drawing a warning from race director Beaux Barfield. Sébastien Bourdais, who, along with Alex Tagliani and Oriol Servia, was running his first street race of the season without a Lotus engine, had made it to seventh before suffering mechanical problems which curtailed his race after 24 laps. James Jakes, who was suffering from problems with his brakes throughout {{the early part of the}} race eventually retired on lap 36, having spent ten laps in the pits earlier trying <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
