5|$|Frank, {{the eldest}} of four children, was raised in an Italian-American {{household}} where Italian was often spoken by his grandparents. The family moved often because his father, a chemist and mathematician, worked in <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>industry.</b> After a time in Florida in the 1940s, the family returned to Maryland, where Zappa's father worked at the Edgewood Arsenal chemical warfare facility of the Aberdeen Proving Ground. Due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored mustard gas, gas masks were kept in the home {{in case of an}} accident. This {{had a profound effect on}} Zappa, and references to germs, germ warfare and <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>industry</b> occur throughout his work.|$|E
5|$|Saville was a {{technical}} and scientific-minded leader who helped pioneer advanced mathematics for operations research, and computer systems for centralized coordination of air defense. He advocated {{the expansion of}} radar installations to create an unbroken air defense network. He explored {{the concept of a}} military aircraft designed around an integrated electronics fire-control system built by various subcontractors. After retiring from the military, Saville worked in <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Earth, Van den Berg {{continued to work}} on crystal growth experiments at EG in California and he became the head for the section of materials science. At a later time he moved to Florida to become a chief scientist at the Constellation Technology Corporation. At age 72, he continued to work up to 40 hours a week and grow crystals, a process he compares to gardening. The crystals he grows (Mercuric Iodide crystals) are used to make precision detectors for nuclear radiation. These detectors are used in medical applications, by <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>industry</b> and the International Atomic Energy Agency.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the {{transition}} to the postwar economy was hard for the city, as thousands of jobs were lost at the shipyards with the decline in <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>industry.</b> Eventually the city's social structure began to become more liberal. Replacing shipbuilding as a primary economic force, the paper and chemical industries began to expand. No longer needed for defense, most of the old military bases were converted to civilian uses. Following the war, in which many African Americans had served, veterans and their supporters stepped up activism to gain enforcement of their constitutional rights and social justice, especially in the Jim Crow South. During the 1950s the City of Mobile integrated its police force and Spring Hill College accepted students of all races. Unlike {{in the rest of the}} state, by the early 1960s the city buses and lunch counters voluntarily desegregated.|$|E
5|$|When World War II started, tonnage {{levels at}} the port {{decreased}} and shipping activities were suspended; however, the war did provide economic benefits for the city. Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>industry</b> during the war. Ellington Field, initially built during World War I, was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers and navigators. The Brown Shipbuilding Company was founded in 1942 to build ships for the U.S. Navy during World War II. Due to the boom in defense jobs, thousands of new workers migrated to the city, both blacks and whites competing for the higher-paying jobs. President Roosevelt had established a policy of nondiscrimination for defense contractors, and blacks gained some opportunities, especially in shipbuilding, although not without resistance from whites and increasing social tensions that erupted into occasional violence. Economic gains of blacks who entered defense industries continued in the postwar years.|$|E
5|$|Although {{skeptical of}} New World Order conspiracism, {{political}} scientist David Rothkopf argues, in the 2008 book , {{that the world}} population of 6 billion people is governed by an elite of 6,000 individuals. Until the late 20th century, governments of the great powers provided most of the superclass, accompanied by a few heads of international movements (i.e., the Pope of the Catholic Church) and entrepreneurs (Rothschilds, Rockefellers). According to Rothkopf, in the early 21st century, economic clout—fueled by the explosive expansion of international trade, travel and communication—rules; the nation-state's power has diminished shrinking politicians to minority power broker status; leaders in international business, finance and <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>industry</b> not only dominate the superclass, they move freely into high positions in their nations' governments and back to private life largely beyond the notice of elected legislatures (including the U.S. Congress), which remain abysmally ignorant of affairs beyond their borders. He asserts that the superclass' disproportionate influence over national policy is constructive but always self-interested, and that across the world, few object to corruption and oppressive governments provided they can do business in these countries.|$|E
