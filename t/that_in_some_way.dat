5|$|Vermigli's Eucharistic {{views were}} {{accepted}} in Zürich, but {{he ran into}} controversy over his doctrine of double predestination. Similarly to John Calvin, Vermigli believed <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> God wills the damnation of those not chosen for salvation. Vermigli attempted to avoid confrontation over the issue, but Bibliander began to openly attack him in 1557, at one point allegedly challenging him to a duel with a double-edged axe. Bibliander held the Erasmian view that God only predestines that {{those who believe in}} him will be saved, not the salvation of any individual. Reformed theologians during this time held a variety of beliefs about predestination, and Bullinger's position is ambiguous, but they agreed that God sovereignly and unconditionally chooses whom to save. They believed salvation is not based on any characteristic of a person, including their faith. Bullinger and the Zürich church did not necessarily agree with Vermigli's double predestinarian view, but Bibliander's view was deemed unallowable. He was dismissed in 1560, in part to assure other Reformed churches of the Zürich church's orthodoxy. Vermigli was involved in predestinarian controversy again when Zanchi, who had remained in Strasbourg when Vermigli left for Zürich, was accused of heretical teachings on the Eucharist and predestination by the Lutheran Johann Marbach. Vermigli was selected to write the official judgement of the Zürich church on the matter in a statement signed by Bullinger and other leaders December1561. His affirmation of a strong doctrine of predestination represented the opinion of the Zürich church as a whole.|$|E
25|$|During the {{election}} of 1669 the gathered szlachta unexpectedly flexed their muscle and acted against the leading magnate parties. After the convocation sejm excluded all candidates <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> had violated the legal process, the rowdy crowd demonstrated its preference for mediocrity by choosing the incompetent and inept Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki. Wiśniowiecki, advised by the Vice-Chancellor, Bishop Andrzej Olszowski, married Eleanor of Austria, who became well regarded for her tenure as the Queen of Poland.|$|E

He is particularly known for his stories and essays with profound philosophical content that exposed a vitalism <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> anticipated existentialism. His philosophical and political statements in favor of anarchism are also well known.|$|E

So even though the relationship {{was a bit of a}} disaster, I feel <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> I did get something out of it, which was about half the songs on this record,” Kiedis said.|$|E
500|$|At {{their peak}} in the Paleozoic, the brachiopods {{were among the most}} {{abundant}} filter-feeders and reef-builders, and occupied other ecological niches, including swimming in the jet-propulsion style of scallops. However, after the Permian–Triassic extinction event, informally known as the [...] "Great Dying", brachiopods recovered only a third of their former diversity. It was often thought that brachiopods were actually declining in diversity, and <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> bivalves out-competed them. However, [...] in 1980, Gould and Calloway produced a statistical analysis that concluded that: both brachiopods and bivalves increased {{all the way from the}} Paleozoic to modern times, but bivalves increased faster; the Permian–Triassic extinction was moderately severe for bivalves but devastating for brachiopods, so that brachiopods for the first time were less diverse than bivalves and their diversity after the Permian increased from a very low base; there is no evidence that bivalves out-competed brachiopods, and short-term increases or decreases for both groups appeared synchronously. In 2007 Knoll and Bambach concluded that brachiopods were one of several groups that were most vulnerable to the Permian–Triassic extinction, as all had calcareous hard parts (made of calcium carbonate) and had low metabolic rates and weak respiratory systems.|$|E

2500|$|After the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, {{the former}} Danish provinces of [...] Blekinge, Halland and Scania became a Swedish dominion, {{but they were}} allowed to keep their old privileges, laws and customs. However, from the 1680s, a process of Swedification was introduced, {{including}} a switch of languages used in churches and restrictions imposed on cross border travel and trade. The situation in Scania was unique from a linguistic point of view; modern sociolinguistic studies often approach {{it as a way to}} study the roots of linguistic nationalism.
