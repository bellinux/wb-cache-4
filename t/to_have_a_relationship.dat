500|$|The {{mothering}} {{nature of}} Janeway on Kim {{has been described}} by reviewers, with the crew forming a type of family network which has Kim as a surrogate son. His separation from his nuclear family at a young age is described as cruel, and Janeway, Chakotay and Tuvok are highlighted as his de facto parents in the series. This motherly position was described by Michelle Erica Green in her review of the episode [...] "The Disease" [...] for TrekNation, who described certain scenes as Kim needing to request permission from [...] "Mommy" [...] in order <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> with an alien. She felt that the disease itself caused the character to grow a [...] "backbone" [...] as he had rarely asserted himself previously to the Captain.|$|E

25|$|During John Byrne's {{time on the}} Wonder Woman comic, he insinuated that Artemis {{previously}} <b>had</b> <b>an</b> {{affair with}} the New God Kanto. This fell out of established history as no prior connection of Artemis or the Amazons <b>to</b> Apokolips <b>had</b> been established until Darkseid's invasion of Themyscira shortly after Artemis' death. Because of this the only other time Artemis could have met Kanto would have been before the Banas invaded Paradise Island, leaving Artemis to be between infancy to fourteen years of age. Thus {{she would have been}} much too young <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> with the grown adult.|$|R
500|$|Enough Said was {{the fifth}} film written and {{directed}} by Nicole Holofcener. After the release of her fourth film, Please Give (2010), she was approached by Matthew Greenfield and Claudia Lewis from Fox Searchlight, who offered to produce Holofcener's next project on the condition that it was more mainstream than her previous films. She wrote three drafts of the screenplay over six months. The premise was partly inspired by Holofcener's own life as a divorced mother of two teenagers and her [...] "feelings and fears about what [...] life will be like when [...] kids go away". While writing the film, she said, [...] "I was having thoughts about my ex-husband and my new boyfriend and thinking about being married and how I'm trying <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> that's happier the second time." [...] Small details of the plot were also drawn from her life; Albert's guacamole-eating habit was inspired by a story that her boyfriend told her about his ex-wife.|$|E
500|$|Walt Disney himself first {{attempted}} {{to adapt the}} fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel" [...] into a feature-length animated film during the 1940s. However, the filmmaker's efforts were never fully realized because the fairy tale was considered too [...] "small". In 2008, co-directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard decided to enlarge the film's scale in order to transform it into a [...] "big event" [...] in order {{for it to be}} successful. Meanwhile, the character Mother Gothel was developed into a much more complex villain than the witch upon whom she is based, conceiving her as [...] "a very lonely woman who really did not know how <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> of any kind". Little else had been determined about the character at the time, who was simply described as [...] "the type of woman who ... envisioned herself in the spotlight." [...] A departure from traditional Disney villains, Mother Gothel is not a witch or a sorceress. Because she lacks supernatural powers, the character is forced to rely solely on her wit, charm, intellect and charisma, a conscious decision made by Greno and Howard. However, in the Brothers Grimm's original fairy tale, Gothel is very much depicted as a typical witch-like character, an idea that was modified for the Disney film adaptation in favor of having Gothel's agelessness instead be [...] "derive ... from Rapunzel's hair." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{were looking}} for someone who had a [...] "Paris Hilton quality" [...] to play Shannon, but she could not just be shallow, as the storyline would require more than that. A lot of women auditioned before the producers finally settled on Maggie Grace. She was written to be a bitch in the first season as the producers needed a character they could use to create opposition and conflict. The producers thought it would be interesting for there to be more to Shannon and Boone's relationship than just Boone's possessive brotherly interest. They {{came up with the idea}} for them to be unrelated stepsiblings, who have a romantic encounter, which became the twist for their backstory. When Boone is killed at the end of season one, it forces Shannon into a more adult existence on the Island. Grace noted Boone is [...] "the only person that ever really knew and loved Shannon, in spite of herself. Of course, losing him, especially with so much left unsaid and unresolved, will change her irrevocably." [...] This freed her up to develop her relationship with Sayid. Naveen Andrews, who plays Sayid, came up with the idea for Shannon and Sayid relationship. He thought, [...] "What would really shock Middle-America? What if Sayid was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> with a woman that looked like Miss America? The most unlikely pairing… to come completely from left field." [...] This pairing made Shannon [...] "less flighty... more of a person to be reckoned with." [...] According to Lost producer Carlton Cuse, [...] "The relationships [...] expect on the show are not necessarily the ones that we [...] necessarily are going to give you, but we want to try to find ways in which characters that you don't expect to kind of connect to one another to connect in ways that are kind of surprising." ...|$|E
