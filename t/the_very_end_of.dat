5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Preclassic Period, around 100–300 AD, {{cities in}} the {{highlands}} and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts. This cessation {{in the production of}} stelae was the most dramatic symptom of a general decline in the region at this time. This decline has been linked to the intrusion of peoples from the western highlands combined with the disastrous eruption of the Ilopango Volcano that severely affected the entire region.|$|E
5|$|Helene was a {{long-lived}} Cape Verde-type hurricane {{that formed}} in the extreme southeastern part of the North Atlantic Ocean, peaking as a Category3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale as it traversed the central Atlantic.

40|$|The paper proposes an {{extension}} of the symmetric Baxter-King band pass filter to an asymmetric Baxter-King filter. It turns out the optimal correction scheme of the ideal filter weights is the same as in the symmetric version, i. e, cut the ideal filter at the appropriate length and add a constant to all filter weights to ensure zero weight on zero frequency. Since the symmetric Baxter-King filter is unable to extract the band <b>of</b> frequencies at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series, the extension to an asymmetric filter is useful whenever the real time estimation is needed. The paper assesses the filter’s properties in extracting business cycle frequencies, in comparison to the symmetric Baxter-King filter and symmetric and asymmetric Christiano-Fitzgerald filter, by using Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that the asymmetric Baxter-King filter is superior to the asymmetric Christiano-Fitzgerald filter for the whole sample space, including <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> a sample, thus indicating that the asymmetric Baxter-King filter should be preferred over the asymmetric Christiano-Fitzgerald filter in real time signal extraction exercises...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins. At <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing {{to one of the}} two strands.

While these sediments have not been dated radiometrically, evidence from biostratigraphy and paleomagnetism suggest that they were deposited during the Maastrichtian stage, which lasted from 70 to 66 Ma (million years ago). Majungasaurus teeth are found up until <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Maastrichtian, when all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct.|$|E

5|$|Much of our {{evidence}} for 4th century army unit deployments {{is contained in}} a single document, the Notitia Dignitatum, compiled c. 395–420, a manual of all late Roman public offices, military and civil. The main deficiency with the Notitia is that it lacks any personnel figures so as to render estimates of army size impossible. Also, it was compiled at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the 4th century; it is thus difficult to reconstruct the position earlier. However, the Notitia remains the central source on the late Army's structure due to the dearth of other evidence.

The chasm between Marie and Julien, due to his corporeality and her ghostly nature, is emphasised in the contrast between his physical activity and her status as an onlooker. Rivette says he wanted the lovers to appear ill-suited and for the viewer to question the relationship; they love each other passionately yet they are essentially strangers. Béart believes that Marie was more alive than Julien, and that he literally wakes up to her existence only at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the film.|$|E

5|$|The {{function}} of the Maya stela was central to the ideology of Maya kingship {{from the very beginning}} of the Classic Period through to <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Terminal Classic (800–900). The hieroglyphic inscriptions on the stelae of the Classic period site of Piedras Negras played a key part in the decipherment of the script, with stelae being grouped around seven different structures and each group appearing to chart the life of a particular individual, with key dates being celebrated, such as birth, marriage and military victories. From these stelae, epigrapher Tatiana Proskouriakoff was able to identify that they contained details of royal rulers and their associates, rather than priests and gods as had previously been theorised.|$|E
5|$|The most elite, veteran Antigonid-period Macedonian {{infantry}} from {{at least}} the time of Antigonus III Doson were the peltasts, lighter and more maneuverable soldiers wielding peltai javelins, swords, and a smaller bronze shield than Macedonian phalanx pikemen, although they sometimes served in that capacity. Among the peltasts, roughly 2,000 men were selected {{to serve in the}} elite agema vanguard, with other peltasts numbering roughly 3,000. The amount of peltasts varied over time, perhaps never more than 5,000 men (the largest figure mentioned by ancient historians, an amount that existed in the Social War of 219 BC). They fought alongside the phalanx pikemen, divided now into chalkaspides 'bronze shield' and leukaspides 'white shield' regiments, up until <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the kingdom in 168 BC.|$|E

Pat Burrell and Wagner became embroiled in heated media discussions after Wagner departed the Phillies. For the first time in 2006, both franchises fielded contenders until deep into the season. The Mets steadily led the NL East (finally supplanting the decade-long division champions, the Atlanta Braves), while the Phillies maintained pace as a wild card contender until <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the season. The Mets won the head-to-head season matchup, beating the Phillies 11 out of 18 times.
