40|$|Abstract The {{management}} {{of patients with}} an apparently normal functional total knee arthroplasty (TKA) suffering from unexplained persistent pain and swelling is a challenging issue. The usual causes of pain after total knee replacement are well known, {{but there are a}} small number of patients in whom its aetiology is obscure. Malfunction due to soft <b>tissue</b> <b>impingement</b> has rarely been reported. A patient with an unusual case of posterior soft <b>tissue</b> <b>impingement</b> secondary to a trapped posterior horn of a remnant medial meniscus after TKA and responsible for severe early polyethylene wear, is reported. The diagnosis was confirmed by arthroscopy. Treatment was performed by arthrotomy. The meniscus remnant was removed followed by total synovectomy and isolated exchange of the polyethylene insert. To our knowledge, this is the first well-documented case reporting this association. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{validate}} {{the use of}} contrast-enhanced (CE) fat-suppressed three-dimensional (3 D) fast gradient-recalled acquisition in the steady state with radiofrequency spoiling (FSPGR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the diagnosis of anterolateral soft <b>tissue</b> <b>impingement</b> of the ankle, {{as compared to the}} use of routine ankle MRI. Materials and Methods: Contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed 3 D-FSPGR MRI and routine MRI scans were retrospectively reviewed for 45 patients with arthroscopically proven anterolateral impingement. In addition, scans were reviewed in 45 control subjects with diagnoses other than impingement. Two radiologists independently reviewed the two sets of images in random order. Using areas (Az) under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), we compared the depiction of anterolateral soft <b>tissue</b> <b>impingement</b> in the two sets of images. Results: The overall accuracy for lesion characterization was significantly higher (p < 0. 05) using the CE fat-suppressed 3 D-FSPGR MR images (Az = 0. 892 and 0. 881 for reader 1 and 2, respectively) than using the routine MR images (A...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary MOM {{bearings}} (large-diameter heads) {{offered the}} perceived benefits of much greater {{range of motion}} and greater stability with reduced risk of impingement and dislocation. A variety of design and Both positive [1 - 3] and negative reports [4 - 8] have now emerged with regard to total hip arthroplasty (THA) and resurfacing arthroplasty. As a result, {{there has been an}} avalanche of studies focused on critical issues such as: surgical positioning, shallow cups (face angles 144 - 170 °) [9 - 11] and “edge loading”. [5, 7, 12 - 17] However, there are several, possibly synergistic, risk scenarios that could trigger adverse MOM wear and very little {{progress has been made in}} understanding such interacting parameters. In an effort to understand the role of metal ion analysis and how it relates to revision surgery and implant wear, selected MOM revised cases were reviewed [28]. Retrieval data was included in conjunction with metal ion analyses and intraoperative observations to determine various failure modes.   We suggest MOM devices that are well fixed but fail after 2 years can be classified into one of six modes: (i) normal, (ii) allergic reaction, (iii) 3 rd body wear, (iv) repetitive subluxation with metal impingement, (v) multi-directional subluxation with soft <b>tissue</b> <b>impingement,</b> and (vi) repetitive subluxation with soft <b>tissue</b> <b>impingement...</b>|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA), {{residual}} pain may be {{secondary to}} soft <b>tissue</b> <b>impingements,</b> which {{are difficult to}} visualize around chromium-cobalt implants using medical imaging, so their interactions remain poorly understood. The goal of this work was to establish a protocol for in-vitro imaging of the soft tissues around TKA, usable during throughout the range of motion (ROM). METHODS: The full size range of a commercially available TKA prosthesis was manufactured by 3 D-printing in non-magnetic and non-radiopaque polymer and implanted in 12 cadaveric knees. The relations between these implants and the soft tissues (Popliteus tendon, Medial and Lateral Collateral Ligament, Patellar and Quadriceps tendons) were analyzed, using MRI (5 embalmed specimens) and CT scans after injection of the tissues with barium-sulfate (3 embalmed and 4 fresh-frozen specimens). RESULTS: Both MRI and CT scans enabled good identification of the soft tissues before TKA implantation. MRI produced minimal loss in signal and contrast, and neither the low temperature nor the embalming fluids compromised image quality. CT scans were more precise after TKA implantation, particularly {{the borders of the}} implant and the differentiation of soft tissues. Full ROM investigation, manual segmentation and three-dimensional reconstructions were possible only with the CT scan. CONCLUSION: The experimental approach described in this study was successful in visualizing the interactions between the soft tissue and the implants before and after TKA and during the full ROM. The coordinate system allows to localize precisely the different anatomic structures and to quantify any change due to prosthetic implantation...|$|R
30|$|Cadaver dissections help to {{understand}} the relations between bone and soft tissues, but correct visualization requires aggressive dissections, which compromise the native anatomy and enable only qualitative assessments. The use of CT scans or MRI with cadaver specimens could avoid such large dissections and enable quantitative measurements of soft <b>tissue</b> displacements and <b>impingements,</b> but the above-mentioned difficulties with in-vivo MRI or CT scan persist.|$|R

30|$|Pin sites {{should be}} {{encouraged}} to heal around the wires and pins, like a pierced ear heals. 1 After completion of the procedure, all pin sites must be free of skin tenting and soft <b>tissue</b> <b>impingement</b> [2, 5, 26]. Sterile dressings should be placed around pin sites and held continuously in place {{with a small amount of}} pressure, to prevent skin tenting and haematoma formation [28]. Various dressings have been used, ranging from dry dressings [28], open-cell foam dressing [2], betadine-soaked gauze [5], to alcoholic solution of chlorhexidine-soaked gauze [10]. Regardless of the choice of dressings, their main purpose is to keep the pin sites clean and dry, and absorb any blood and exudates [28] and therefore we discourage the usage of paraffin gauze around the pins.|$|E
40|$|We {{have read}} the article ‘‘Treatment of anterolateral impingements of the ankle joint by arthroscopy’ ’ by A. -H. M. Hassan with interest, care and {{appreciation}} [1]. One of the questions in this publication is whether anterior ankle arthroscopy can routinely be performed without joint distraction. He states that in patients with anterior ankle soft <b>tissue</b> <b>impingement,</b> distraction will result in tightening of the joint capsule thereby decreasing the anterior working area [1]. These findings are similar to ours [2]. With ankle distraction multiple anatomic structures are pulled tight. The ankle joint capsule has a characteristic difference in comparison with other joint capsules; the anterior capsular insertion in the tibia and talus is located at {{some distance from the}} cartilaginous layer.

40|$|Articles {{from the}} anatomy, orthopaedic, and {{radiology}} literature since 1943 were reviewed, and possible sources of anterior ankle impingement were identified therein.

40|$|High-resolution {{ultrasonography}} (US) {{has gained}} increasing popularity as a diagnostic tool for {{assessment of the}} soft <b>tissues</b> in shoulder <b>impingement</b> syndrome. US is a powerful and accurate method for diagnosis of rotator cuff tears and other rotator cuff abnormalities, provided the examiner has a detailed knowledge of shoulder anatomy, uses a standardized examination technique, and has {{a thorough understanding of}} the potential pitfalls, limitations, and artifacts. False-positive sonographic findings of rotator cuff tears can be caused by the technique (anisotropy, transducer positioning, acoustic shadowing by the deltoid septum), by the anatomy (rotator cuff interval, supraspinatus-infraspinatus interface, musculotendinous junction, fibrocartilaginous insertion), or by disease (criteria for diagnosis of rotator cuff tears, tendon inhomogeneity, acoustic shadowing by scar tissue or calcification, rotator cuff thinning). False-negative sonographic findings of rotator cuff tears can be caused by the technique (transducer frequency, suboptimal focusing, imaging protocol, transducer handling), by the anatomy (nondiastasis of the ruptured tendon fibers, posttraumatic obscuration of landmarks), by disease (tendinosis, calcifications, synovial proliferation, granulation or scar tissue, bursal thickening, massive rotator cuff tears), or by patient factors (obesity, muscularity, limited shoulder motion) ...|$|R
30|$|PMMA spacers offer several {{potential}} advantages {{in the setting}} of post-infective reconstruction. Bone transport through scar tissue, using more traditional Ilizarov techniques, can be particularly problematic. The use of temporary PMMA spacers prevents soft <b>tissue</b> <b>impingement</b> between {{the leading edge of the}} transport segment and the target segment. As illustrated in an animal model, the induced membrane prevents protrusion of adjacent soft tissue and neurovascular structures into the defect and adheres to the resected bone edges without collapse despite removal of the spacer, thus delineating a cavity corresponding to the volume of the retrieved cement spacer [6, 29]. This so-called spacer effect can be utilized in the reconstruction of bone defects where the resulting cylindrical cavity forms a stable envelope through which a bone segment may be transported.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to its potential to measure prosthetic migration, low-field MRI is excellently suited for judging the soft tissue structures surrounding the implants. Future research should investigate the added clinical benefit {{of being able to}} assess soft tissue structures as well as prosthetic positioning and migration. If low-field MRI is capable of these combined evaluations, the technique could be beneficial for individual patients who have recurrent or persisting symptoms after total knee arthroplasty. Low-field MRI could aid to diagnose whether this is caused by migration of the prosthesis and/or by other issues such as malpositioning or soft <b>tissue</b> <b>impingement</b> problems. Furthermore, {{it should be noted that}} compared to high-field MRI, low-field MRI is considerably less expensive and could therefore be a relatively cost-effective manner to assess soft tissue aspects as well as prosthetic migration.|$|E

40|$|Among the {{surgical}} options to treat trapeziometacarpal osteoarthrosis, trapeziectomy {{has been criticized}} as unable to prevent postoperative collapse of the thumb, causing painful scapho-metacarpal impingement. The implantation of an external minifixator {{between the first and}} the second metacarpals for sufficient time has been proposed to maintain the postoperative space created by the bone resection to allow the development of a resistant interposed fibrous tissue. Nineteen patients (16 women, 3 men, mean age 64. 5 years) were evaluated at 3. 3 years of follow-up after an unilateral trapeziectomy and first metacarpal suspension by external minifixation. Eighty-four percent of the patients were very satisfied with the operation. The mean DASH score was 27. 7 %, the pain 1. 7 / 10 (Visual Analogue Scale), the opening angle of the first web 58. 3 ° and the Kapandji opposition score 9. 5 / 10. Sonography demonstrated the existence of a strong fibrotic interposed <b>tissue,</b> preventing scapho-metacarpal <b>impingement.</b> The mean height of the trapeziectomy space (8. 4 mm) was maintained upon active pinch and maximal traction on the thumb. A significant atrophy of thenar muscles was also demonstrated, except for the Abductor pollicis brevis. In conclusion, total trapeziectomy with external minifixation provides acceptable clinical results, stabilizes the base of the thumb and prevents scapho-metacarpal impingement. The study brings also important new information {{about the nature of the}} interposed tissue in the trapezial space and about the state of the thenar muscles after trapeziectomy.

30|$|Geometric morphometric {{analysis}} {{is a global}} 3 D analysis {{that takes into account}} the location of each landmark in space relative to the others. Our analysis confirms that this dimorphism exists even when the size effect is removed. Furthermore, doing an analysis based on ratios or lengths over-simplifies the problem. It has been shown that soft <b>tissue</b> <b>impingement</b> due to overhang leads to postoperative pain and worse functional outcomes (Dai et al. 2014; Ho et al. 2006; Mahoney & Kinsey 2010). Reducing the size of the femoral component increases the risk of instability during knee flexion. If the femoral implant is shifted proximally to compensate for downsizing, the height of the joint line will be altered. For these reasons, only adjusting the size does not solve the problem – the shape must be taken into account.|$|E
40|$|Background. Anterior soft <b>tissue</b> <b>impingement</b> is {{a common}} cause of chronic pain in the ankle. The {{preferred}} method of operative treatment is an arthroscopic excision of hypertrophic fibrous and synovial tissue in the anterior part of the ankle joint. Methods. We present the results of arthroscopic treatment of anterior ankle impingement in group of 14 patients. Results. Subjective improvement after the procedure was observed in all patients and 13 of them (93 %) were without any symptoms after the operation. One patient reported of intermittent pain, especially when walking on uneven grounds. Conclusions. We conclude that arthroscopic excision of hypertrophic synovial tissue in the anterior part of the ankle which causes the symptoms of impingement is a minimally invasive procedure that is both safe and reliable.

40|$|Thirty-one {{knees with}} {{symptomatic}} total knee arthroplasty were diagnosed and treated arthroscopically. There were 18 knees with soft <b>tissue</b> <b>impingement</b> and 13 knees without. There were 16 knees with painful arthroplasty {{and range of}} motion (ROM) greater than 90 °. Hypertrophied synovitis with or without impingement was more easily found by arthroscopy in this group than in the other 15 knees with the chief complaint of limited ROM, where more remarkable fibrotic tissue with intra-articular adhesion was found. Overall, the average improvement in ROM was 43. 1 ° immediately after arthroscopy, and 20 ° at the final follow-up.

30|$|The role of soft <b>tissue</b> <b>impingement</b> in {{residual}} pain after joint prostheses {{has been}} emphasized only recently. In Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) the first ilipsoas impingements were described in 1995 by Trousdale (Trousdale et al. 1995), and in TKA, painful impingements between the Popliteus Tendon and the lateral condyle were described by Barnes and Scott in 1995 and by Allardyce et al. in 1997 (Allardyce et al. 1997; Barnes & Scott 1995). Generally speaking, {{the influence of}} component overhang on residual pain after TKA has been investigated {{only in the last}} decade (Bonnin et al. 2015; Bonnin et al. 2013; Mahoney & Kinsey 2010) and we can guess that the real rate of such impingements is underestimated due to the difficulties of clinical imaging. Better knowledge of interactions between soft tissues and implants would be critical to identify (Kazakin et al. 2014; Trousdale et al. 1995) and prevent impingements by improving surgical techniques (Kazakin et al. 2014; Trousdale et al. 1995) or implant design (Argenson et al. 2005; Vandenbussche et al. 2007).|$|E
40|$|Anterior ankle {{impingement}} is {{a common}} cause of chronic ankle pain, particularly in athletic populations. Morris and McMurray provided the earliest descriptions of anterior impingement, coining the condition as "athlete's ankle" or "footballer's ankle". The pathology has since been a topic of considerable investigation and has been re-termed "anterior ankle impingement syndrome". Treatment with open surgery has provided good results historically, but {{at the price of}} significant complications. Advancements in ankle arthroscopy have decreased the risk of complication drastically and evidence in the literature indicates that anterior arthroscopy is an effective approach to treating osseous and soft <b>tissue</b> <b>impingement.</b> Effective clinical diagnosis and diagnostic imaging are critical for pre-surgical planning. Preoperative detection of anterior osteophytes has been correlated with outcomes. Factors such as joint space narrowing and large osteophytes may also influence outcomes. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of diagnosis and surgical technique can influence patient outcomes, and patient expectations can be managed around prognostic indicators such as the presence of osteoarthritis. The purpose of this review is to discuss the etiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, surgical technique, and postoperative rehabilitation of anteromedial and anterolateral anterior ankle impingement syndrome and to evaluate the evidence-based outcomes of arthroscopic managemen...|$|E
40|$|Femoroacetabular {{impingement}} (FAI) is {{an established}} cause of osteoarthrosis of the hip. Surgery {{is intended to}} remove the cause of impingement with hip dislocation and resection of osseous prominences of the acetabular rim and of the femoral head-neck junction. Using the Merle d’Aubigné score and qualitative categories, recent studies suggest good to excellent outcomes in 75 % to 80 % of patients after open surgery with dislocation of the femoral head. Unsatisfactory outcome is mainly related to pain, located either {{in the area of}} the greater trochanter or in the groin. There are several reasons for persisting groin pain. Joint degeneration with joint space narrowing and/or osteophyte formation, insufficient correction of the acetabula, and femoral pathology are known factors for unsatisfactory outcome. Recently, intraarticular adhesions between the femoral neck and joint capsule have been identified as an additional cause of postoperative groin pain. The adhesions form between the joint capsule and the resected area on the femoral neck and may lead to soft <b>tissue</b> <b>impingement.</b> MR-arthrography is used for diagnosis and the adhesions can be treated successfully by arthroscopy. While arthroscopic resection improves outcome it is technically demanding. Avoiding the formation of adhesions is important and is perhaps best accomplished by passive motion exercises after the initial surgery...|$|E

The {{aim of the}} present study was to perform a systematic review of the current treatments of these injuries to identify the best non-surgical and surgical management for patients with acute isolated syndesmotic injuries. A review of the literature was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, and Google Scholar databases was performed using the following keywords: "ankle injury", "syndesmotic injury", "chronic", "acute", "treatment", "conservative", "non-operative" "operative", "fixation", "osteosynthesis", "screw", "synostosis", "ligamentoplasties" over the years 1962 - 2015. The literature search and cross-referencing resulted in a total of 345 references, of which 283 were rejected due to off-topic abstract and/or failure to fulfil the inclusion criteria. After reading the remaining full-text articles, we included four studies, describing non-surgical management, and only two studies investigating surgical {{management of}} acute isolated injuries. The ESSKA-AFAS consensus panel provided recommendations to improve the management of patients with isolated acute syndesmotic injury in clinical practice. Non-surgical management is recommended for stable ankle lesions and includes: 3 -week non-weight bearing, a below-the-knee cast, rest and ice, followed by proprioceptive exercises. Surgery is recommended for unstable lesions. Syndesmotic screw is recommended to achieve a temporary fixation of the mortise.

30|$|In Fillingham et al., {{the authors}} observe that 18 of 19 {{patients}} who received at least one distal femur plate experienced a post-operative delay in function [11]. Consistent with these findings, Burghardt et al. note that PT {{is more likely to}} be needed after femoral than tibial plates because of limited ROM of the knee [13]. In our current evaluation of the capacity of postoperative PT to prevent delayed return of function, the only two patients who experienced decreased function despite PT underwent distal femoral manipulation. Fillingham et al. discuss the surgical approach to the distal femur and hypothesize why femoral plates tend to be more associated with functional pain, use of crutches, or impaired range of motion [11]. In a recent cadaveric study, Bachmann et al. performed temporary hemiepiphysiodesis with a plate and two screws at the distal medial femur in eight adult specimens [19]. Following surgical manipulation, they dissected specimens to assess soft and connective tissue damage. Based on their findings, they concluded that correct plate placement for temporary hemiepiphysiodesis of the distal medial femur frequently leads to damage to the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) (six of eight specimens), soft <b>tissue</b> <b>impingement,</b> and accidental arthrotomy of the knee joint (four of eight specimens) [19]. During normal knee motion, medial capsular structures including the MPFL glide over the surface of the medial femoral condyle; we would therefore expect impingement of the anterior aspect of the MPFL or joint capsule by a plate to hinder motion and cause pain during knee flexion.|$|E
40|$|Background: Arthrodesis of the hallux metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint is {{commonly}} {{done as a}} primary procedure either to correct severe hallux valgus deformities or for rheumatoid arthritis, hallux rigidus, in patients with neuromuscular disorders and as a salvage procedure for failed bunion surgery or infection. Prominent metalwork frequently can cause soft <b>tissue</b> <b>impingement</b> and thus require removal.

We describe a surgical technique and the early results of arthrodesis of the hallux metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint using an intraosseous fixation device. Materials and Methods: Twelve consecutive patients operated with this method were retrospectively reviewed. The average age was 57 years (range 44 – 88 years). A retrospective review of radiographs and electronic medical notes was conducted. The patients were also asked to fill a satisfaction questionnaire. Results: Overall fusion rate was 91 % with a mean hallux valgus angle of 15 ° (range 4 – 20 °) and a mean dorsiflexion angle of 20 ° (range 7 – 30 °). Complications included a case of failed fusion, a delayed union, and a case of persisting transfer metatarsalgia. At a mean followup of 14 months (range 5 – 28 months), the mean visual analog scale improved significantly from a mean of 8. 4 (range 7 – 10) preoperatively, to a mean of 3. 1 (range 0 – 7) postoperatively (P < 0. 0001).

40|$|Abstract PURPOSE: To review {{outcomes}} of 24 patients who underwent Ilizarov ring fixation for infected nonunion of the tibia. METHODS: Medical records of 21 men and 3 women aged 13 to 74 (mean, 38) years who underwent Ilizarov ring fixation for infected non-union of the tibia were reviewed. The mean bone defect was 3. 3 (range, 2 - 5) cm. The mean time from injury to presentation was 11. 9 (range, 1 - 36) months. The {{mean number of}} previous surgeries was 2 (range, 0 - 14). A local flap was used in 2 patients and a free flap was used in one patient. Nine of the patients underwent Ilizarov ring fixation without soft tissue and bony resection, as inadequate stability {{was the reason for}} non-union. Patients were assessed using the Association for the Study and Application of the Method of Ilizarov criteria. RESULTS: Patients were followed up for a mean of 11 (range, 8 - 46) months. Functional outcome was excellent in 8 patients, good in 12, fair in 2, and failure in one, whereas bone union outcome was excellent in 6 patients, good in 14, fair in one, and poor in 2. The mean time to union was 8 (range, 3 - 31) months. The mean external fixation index was 4. 2 (range, 1. 5 - 15. 7) cm/month.

40|$|Anterior ankle {{impingement}} {{is characterized}} by anterior ankle pain on activity. Recurrent (hyper) dorsiflexion is often the cause. Typically, there is pain on palpation at the anteromedial or anterolateral joint line. Some swelling or limitation in dorsiflexion are present. Plain radiographs can disclose {{the cause of the}} impingement. In the case of spurs or osteophytes, the diagnosis is anterior bony impingement. In the absence of spurs or osteophytes, the diagnosis is anterior soft <b>tissue</b> <b>impingement.</b> In patients with anteromedial impingement, plain radiographs ae often falsely negative. An oblique view (anteromedial impingement view = AMI view) is recommended in these patients. Arthroscopic management with removal of the offending tissue provides good to excellent long-term (5 - 8 years) results in 83 % of patients with grade 0 and grade I lesions. Long-term results are good/excellent in 50 % of patients with grade II lesions (osteophytes secondary to arthritis with joint space narrowing). In posterior ankle impingement, patients experience hindfoot pain when the ankle is forcedly plantarflexed. Trauma or overuse can be the cause. The trauma mechanism is hyperplantarflexion or a combined inversion plantarflexion injury. Overuse injuries typically occur in ballet dancers and downhill runners, who report pain on palpation at the posterolateral aspect of the talus. On plain radiographs, an os trigonum or hypertrophic posterior or talar process can be detected. Surgical management involves removal of the os trigonum, scar tissue, or hypertrophic posterior talar process. In the case of combined posterior bony impingement and flexor hallucis longus tendinopathy, a release of the flexor hallucis longus is performed simultaneously.

40|$|Impingement syndromes of {{the ankle}} involve either osseous or soft <b>tissue</b> <b>{{impingement}}</b> {{and can be}} anterior, anterolateral, or posterior. Ankle impingement syndromes are painful conditions caused by the friction of joint tissues, which are both the cause {{and the effect of}} altered joint biomechanics. The distal fascicle of the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL) is possible cause of anterior impingement. The objective of this article was to review the literature concerning the anatomy, pathogenesis, symptoms and treatment of the AITFL impingement and finally to formulate treatment recommendations. The AITFL starts from the distal tibia, 5  mm in average above the articular surface, and descends obliquely between the adjacent margins of the tibia and fibula, anterior to the syndesmosis to the anterior aspect of the lateral malleolus. The incidence of the accessory fascicle differs very widely in the several studies. The presence of the distal fascicle of the AITFL and also the contact with the anterolateral talus is probably a normal finding. It may become pathological, due to anatomical variations and/or anterolateral instability of the ankle resulting from an anterior talofibular ligament injury. When observed during an ankle arthroscopy, the surgeon should look for the criteria described to decide whether it is pathological and considering resection of the distal fascicle. The presence of the AITFL and the contact with the talus is a normal finding. An impingement of the AITFL can result from an anatomical variant or anteroposterior instability of the ankle. The diagnosis of ligamentous impingement in the anterior aspect of the ankle should be considered in patients who have chronic ankle pain in the anterolateral aspect of the ankle after an inversion injury and have a stable ankle, normal plain radiographs, and isolated point tenderness on the anterolateral aspect of the talar dome and in the anteroinferior tibiofibular ligament. The impingement syndrome can be treated arthroscopically...|$|E
