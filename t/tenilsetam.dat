40|$|AbstractNucleation-dependent {{polymerization}} of β-amyloid peptide, {{the major}} component of plaques in patients with Alzheimer's disease, is significantly accelerated by crosslinking through Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs) in vitro. During the polymerization process, both nucleus formation and aggregate growth are accelerated by AGE-mediated crosslinking. Formation of the AGE-crosslinked amyloid peptide aggregates could be attenuated by the AGE-inhibitors <b>Tenilsetam,</b> aminoguanidine and carnosine. These experimental data, and clinical studies, reporting a marked improvement in cognition and memory in Alzheimer's disease patients after <b>Tenilsetam</b> treatment, suggest that AGEs might {{play an important role}} in the etiology or progression of the disease. Thus AGE-inhibitors may generally become a promising drug class for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease...|$|E
40|$|Advanced glycation end {{products}} (AGEs) {{have been}} identified in age-related intracellular protein deposits of Alzheimer’s disease (amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) and Parkinson disease (Lewy bodies), suggesting that these protein deposits have been exposed to AGE precursors such as the reactive dicarbonyl compound methylglyoxal. In ageing tissue and under diabetic pseudohypoxia, intracellular methylglyoxal levels rise through an impairment of triosephosphate utilization. Furthermore, methylglyoxal detoxification is impaired when reduced glutathione levels are low, conditions, which have all been described in Alzheimer’s disease. However, there is less known about the toxicity of methylglyoxal, particularly about therapeutic strategies to scavenge such dicarbonyl compounds and attenuate their toxicity. In our study, extracellularly applied methylglyoxal was shown to be toxic to human neuroblastoma cells in a dose-dependent manner above concentrations of 150 µM with a LD 50 of approximately 1. 25 mM. Pre-incubation of methylglyoxal with a variety of carbonyl scavengers such as aminoguanidine or <b>tenilsetam</b> and the thiol antioxidant lipoic acid significantly reduced its toxicity. In summary, carbonyl scavengers might offer a promising therapeutic strategy to reduce the neurotoxicity of reactive carbonyl compounds, providing a potential benefit for patients with age-related neurodegenerative diseases...|$|E
40|$|Chronic neuroinflammation is now {{considered}} one of the major factors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the most widely used transgenic AD models (overexpressing mutated forms of amyloid precursor protein, presenilin, and/or tau) do not demonstrate the degree of inflammation, neurodegeneration (particularly of the cholinergic system), and cognitive decline that is comparable with the human disease. Hence a more suitable animal model is needed to more closely mimic the resulting cognitive decline and memory loss in humans in order to investigate the effects of neuroinflammation on neurodegeneration. One of these models is the glial fibrillary acidic protein-interleukin 6 (GFAP-IL 6) mouse, in which chronic neuroinflammation triggered constitutive expression of the cytokine interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) in astrocytes. These transgenic mice show substantial and progressive neurodegeneration as well as a decline in motor skills and cognitive function, starting from 6 months of age. This animal model could serve as an excellent tool for drug discovery and validation in vivo. In this review, we have also selected three potential anti-inflammatory drugs, curcumin, apigenin, and <b>tenilsetam,</b> as candidate drugs, which could be tested in this model...|$|E
40|$|Advanced glycation end {{products}} (AGEs) {{are found}} in various intraneuronal protein deposits such as neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease and Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease. Among the many reactive carbonyl compounds and AGE precursors, methylglyoxal {{is most likely to}} contribute to intracellular AGE formation, since it is extremely reactive and constantly produced by degradation of triosephosphates. Furthermore, methylglyoxal levels increase under pathophysiological conditions, for example, when trisosephosphate levels are elevated, the expression or activity of glyoxalase I is decreased, as is the case when the concentration of reduced glutathione, the rate-determining co-factor of glyoxalase I, is low. However, the effects of methylglyoxal on mitochondrial function and energy levels have not been studied in detail. In this study, we show that methylglyoxal increases the formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and lactate in SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cells. Methylglyoxal also decreases mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular ATP levels, suggesting that carbonyl stress-induced loss of mitochondrial integrity could contribute to the cytotoxicity of methylglyoxal. The methylglyoxal-induced effects such as ATP depletion and mitochondrial dysfunction can be prevented by pre-incubation of the cells with the carbonyl scavengers aminoguanidine and <b>tenilsetam.</b> In a clinical context, these compounds could not only offer a promising therapeutic strategy to reduce intracellular AGE-accumulation, but also to decrease the dicarbonyl-induced impairment of energy production in aging and neurodegeneration...|$|E
