50|$|The tenth step is the {{prevention}} of further buildup via metalizing often called thermal spraying. Thermal spraying {{has been around for}} well over 100 years but is still widely known as the best preventative corrosion fighting technique in the world. Thermal spraying is also known for changing the surface of the metallic component and is common with rebuilt crankshafts. Thermal spraying involves protrusion of molten particles onto the heated metallic surface where is bonds and forms a smooth coating interwoven into the structure. There are many different types of <b>thermal</b> <b>spray</b> alloys that can be employed for re-manufactured crankshafts. Typically, boron alloys are used as they very dense, hard and are oxide free. They also prevent against abrasive materials that cause divots, scratches and cracks in addition to preventing surface erosion and corrosion. <b>Thermal</b> <b>spray</b> is an important step some machine shops employ, but not always performed in the industry.|$|E

Coating materials available for <b>thermal</b> <b>spraying</b> include metals, alloys, ceramics, plastics and composites.
