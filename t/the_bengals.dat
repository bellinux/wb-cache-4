50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bengal</b> Presidency was {{established}} in the 18thcentury by the British Empire, with its headquarters in Fort William, in coastal southwestern <b>Bengal.</b> <b>The</b> British made <b>Bengal</b> <b>the</b> center of their Indian empire, during which Bengal became synonymous with India. Until the mid-19th century, <b>the</b> <b>Bengal</b> Presidency's jurisdiction covered British-controlled territories in north India, northeast India, and Southeast Asia. <b>The</b> Governor of <b>Bengal</b> was concurrently <b>the</b> Governor General of India for many years. Fort William's surroundings grew into the port city of Calcutta, which was the capital of India until 1911. After the British Indian Empire {{was established}} in 1858 following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, <b>the</b> <b>Bengal</b> Renaissance flourished in Calcutta and other Bengali urban centers. The Indian independence movement, including parts of the movement which created Pakistan, had its origins in <b>the</b> <b>Bengal</b> Presidency. <b>The</b> Parliament of <b>Bengal,</b> including <b>the</b> <b>Bengal</b> Legislative Council and <b>the</b> <b>Bengal</b> Legislative Assembly, was the oldest and largest in British India.|$|R

The troops of <b>the</b> <b>Bengal</b> Sappers have been a familiar sight for over 200 years in the battlefields of British India with their never-say-die attitude of Chak De and brandishing their favourite tool the hamber.|$|R
5|$|Willie Parker was {{expected}} to return after missing two games, but aggravated his knee injury during a weekday practice and missed the game. Pittsburgh received the opening kickoff and drove 75yards to open the scoring with a 2-yard touchdown pass from Ben Roethlisberger to Mewelde Moore to put the Steelers up 7–0. The Steelers' defense forced <b>the</b> <b>Bengals</b> offense into five consecutive three-and-outs, before <b>the</b> <b>Bengals</b> scored on their final possession of the opening half. The 5-yard pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick to Chad Johnson brought <b>the</b> <b>Bengals</b> within three points of the Steelers, who added a field goal from Jeff Reed.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{called his}} new {{franchise}} <b>the</b> <b>Bengals</b> because Cincinnati had {{a team of}} that name in the 1930s and {{he thought it would}} provide a link to the past. Brown's son Mike joined the front office and became his father's top assistant and right-hand man. Brown brought in other assistants including Bill Johnson, Rick Forzano and Bill Walsh. In their first two seasons in 1968 and 1969, <b>the</b> <b>Bengals</b> fared poorly, but the team appeared to be on the upswing as Brown built up a core group of players through the draft, including quarterback Greg Cook.|$|E
5|$|Chicago struck {{first with}} Charles Tillman intercepting Dalton, which was {{followed}} with Cutler's eight-yard {{touchdown pass to}} Martellus Bennett, which <b>the</b> <b>Bengals</b> responded with a two-yard touchdown pass to Green. On the Bengals' first drive of the second quarter, Green was stripped by Tim Jennings, but the fumble went out of bounds. However, Dalton would be intercepted again by Tillman, his career-high second pick of the game, but the Bears failed to capitalize, and <b>the</b> <b>Bengals</b> scored again on Dalton's 45-yard touchdown pass to Greene. The Bears' Robbie Gould connected on a team record 58-yard field goal to close out the first half. In the second half, <b>the</b> <b>Bengals</b> scored again, after Tillman was penalized for pass interference, via BenJarvus Green-Ellis' 5-yard touchdown run, which the Bears retaliated with Matt Forté's one-yard touchdown run. In the fourth quarter, Cutler was intercepted by Vontaze Burfict, but the Bears got the ball back after Jennings forced Mohamed Sanu to fumble. On the next drive, the Bears converted a fourth down and Cutler threw the go ahead and eventual game-winning 19-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall with 8:06 remaining. <b>The</b> <b>Bengals</b> failed to score on the next drive with 6:38 left, and the Bears clinched the game after Rey Maualuga was called for a personal foul after Michael Bush was stopped on third down. The Bears were able to run out the clock due to Cincinnati mis-using its time-outs.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bengals</b> {{entered the}} NFL in 1970 {{as a result}} of the AFL–NFL merger, and were placed in the newly formed American Football Conference {{alongside}} the Browns. A career-ending injury to Cook before the 1970 season forced <b>the</b> <b>Bengals</b> to rely on Virgil Carter, an emergency backup who could make accurate short passes but could not heave the ball like Cook once could. So Brown and Walsh went to work designing an offense around Carter's limitations, a scheme that was the genesis of the West Coast offense Walsh later used to great effect when he became coach of the San Francisco 49ers.|$|E
