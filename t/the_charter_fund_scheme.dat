5000|$|Although {{charter schools}} may receive less public funding than {{traditional}} public schools, {{a portion of}} charter schools' operating costs can come from sources outside public funding (such as private funding {{in the form of}} donations). A study funded by the American Federation of Teachers found that in DC <b>charter</b> schools, private <b>funding</b> accounted for $780 per pupil on average and, combined with a higher level of public <b>funding</b> in some <b>charters</b> (mostly due to non-district funding), resulted in considerably higher funding when compared to comparable public schools. [...] Without federal funding, private funding, and [...] "other income", D.C. charter schools received slightly more on average ($8,725 versus $8,676 per pupil), but that funding was more concentrated in <b>the</b> better <b>funded</b> <b>charter</b> schools (as seen by <b>the</b> median DC <b>charter</b> school <b>funding</b> of $7,940 per pupil).

50|$|Like their better-known {{open-ended}} cousins, closed-end {{funds are}} usually {{sponsored by a}} fund management company which will control how the fund is invested.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyse the {{effectiveness}} of the performance-based <b>funding</b> <b>scheme</b> of the Finnish universities that was adopted at the beginning of 2013. The political decision-makers expect that the <b>funding</b> <b>scheme</b> will create incentives for the universities to improve performance, but these <b>funding</b> <b>schemes</b> have largely failed in many other countries, primarily because public funding is only a small share of the total funding of universities. This study is interesting because Finnish universities have no tuition fees, unlike in many other countries, and the state allocates funding based on the objectives achieved. The empirical evidence of the graduation rates indicates that graduation rates increased when a new scheme was adopted, especially among male students, who have more room for improvement than female students. The new performance-based <b>funding</b> <b>scheme</b> allocates the <b>funding</b> according to the output-based indicators and limits the scope of strategic planning and the autonomy of the university. The performance-based <b>funding</b> <b>scheme</b> is transformed to the strategy map of the balanced scorecard. The new <b>funding</b> <b>scheme</b> steers universities in many respects but leaves the research and teaching skills to the discretion of the universities. The new scheme has also diminished the importance of the performance agreements between the university and the Ministry. The scheme increases the incentives for universities to improve the processes and structures in order to attain as much public funding as possible. It is optimal for the central administration of the university to allocate resources to faculties and other organisational units following the criteria of the performance-based <b>funding</b> <b>scheme.</b> The new <b>funding</b> <b>scheme</b> has made the universities compete with each other, because the total funding to the universities is allocated to each university according to the <b>funding</b> <b>scheme.</b> There is a tendency that the <b>funding</b> <b>schemes</b> are occasionally improved. The findings of this study are useful for those who wish to modify the <b>funding</b> <b>scheme</b> in the future. </em...|$|R

40|$|Purpose / Context – Political topics like energy {{efficiency}} and climate protection are en vogue. There are manifold funding programmes, but since these are bound to {{the goals of the}} respective programmes, the implemented projects do not adequately consider integrative aspects. It is necessary to analyse the purpose of those funding programs and to bring them in correlation with higher goals of urban development. Methodology / Approach –In the case of ‘Bottrop Innovation City’, 5 depth-interviews were conducted to provide initial impressions of the modernization of municipal structures Results –Some of the assessed municipalities show elaborated(?) strategies to develop promising {{energy efficiency}} projects, all of which with a grand amount of funding resources. Key Findings / Implications – Political top topics have influence on the urban development for centuries. Originality – Germany as a model for energy efficiency strategies has a vast <b>funding</b> <b>scheme</b> which does not exist in other countries. Therefore, it is necessary to analyse the organisation and to develop guidelines for an even better and more sustainable <b>funding</b> <b>scheme.</b> <b>Funding</b> <b>schemes</b> affect city development and have impacts on the housing and the neighbourhood.
