2500|$|Defining what {{constitutes}} a species among different populations within this genus has proved difficult and is still {{a matter of some}} scientific debate. Genetic evidence suggests that all nine species share an ancestor which is [...] "very recent" [...] in deep <b>time</b> <b>terms</b> and that hybridization between them is actually quite common. All species will interbreed in the wild, which has led some biologists to reject the notion of multiple Naultinus species {{in the first place and}} to instead view each [...] "species" [...] as a separate [...] "race" [...] or subspecies of a single, very widespread species of this genus. However, there are many clear differences between recognized species in colouration, breeding times and even scale morphology. Many neighbouring species have slightly different mating seasons and behaviour, which is thought to explain why the species maintain their differences despite [...] "strong reproductive compatibility". These differences are the basis for the present consensus in the scientific community that Nautilnus is constituted of nine species instead of nine races of a single species.|$|E
60|$|Cathelineau {{was carried}} off; but died, a {{fortnight}} later, {{from the effects}} of the wound. His death was a terrible blow to the cause. The failure to take Nantes had, in itself, been a great misfortune; but the Vendeans had suffered no more heavily than the enemy and, had Cathelineau been but spared, matters might still have gone well with them. The effect of his death, however, was for the time to dishearten the peasantry utterly; and had at this <b>time</b> <b>terms</b> of peace, which would have permitted them to enjoy the exercise of their religion, and to be free from conscription, been offered to them, they would gladly have been accepted.|$|E
60|$|Marie Melmotte {{had been}} {{accurately}} described by Felix Carbury to his mother. She was not beautiful, {{she was not}} clever, {{and she was not}} a saint. But then neither was she plain, nor stupid, nor, especially, a sinner. She was a little thing, hardly over twenty years of age, very unlike her father or mother, having no trace of the Jewess in her countenance, who seemed to be overwhelmed by the sense of her own position. With such people as the Melmottes things go fast, and it was very well known that Miss Melmotte had already had one lover who had been nearly accepted. The affair, however, had gone off. In this 'going off' no one imputed to the young lady blame or even misfortune. It was not supposed that she had either jilted or been jilted. As in royal espousals interests of State regulate their expedience with an acknowledged absence, with even a proclaimed impossibility, of personal predilections, so in this case was money allowed to have the same weight. Such a marriage would or would not be sanctioned in accordance with great pecuniary arrangements. The young Lord Nidderdale, the eldest son of the Marquis of Auld Reekie, had offered to take the girl and make her Marchioness in the process of time for half a million down. Melmotte had not objected to the sum,--so it was said,--but had proposed to tie it up. Nidderdale had desired to have it free in his own grasp, and would not move on any other terms. Melmotte had been anxious to secure the Marquis,--very anxious to secure the Marchioness; for at that <b>time</b> <b>terms</b> had not been made with the Duchess; but at last he had lost his temper, and had asked his lordship's lawyer whether it was likely that he would entrust such a sum of money to such a man. 'You are willing to trust your only child to him,' said the lawyer. Melmotte scowled at the man for a few seconds from under his bushy eyebrows; then told him that his answer had nothing in it, and marched out of the room. So that affair was over. I doubt whether Lord Nidderdale had ever said a word of love to Marie Melmotte,--or whether the poor girl had expected it. Her destiny had no doubt been explained to her.|$|E

50|$|At that <b>time</b> <b>terms</b> were {{uncertain}} and the governors picked how long their terms would be. It wasn't until May, 1777 {{where the people}} finally decided to make governor terms one year. This was because The people were afraid of too much government control based on past governors' loyalty to Great Britain, and gave the legislature the most power, severely limiting the governor's power and time. Also at this time the governors could only have one term, they could not go for reelection. In 1789 it was changed to two year terms. Eventually the terms became four years and that stuck, because now every Governor and President have four year terms.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 19th century {{and through the}} 20th century the {{productivity}} capacity visibly grew, accompanied {{by an increase in}} intensity of consumption. It was in this moment that the consumer started to be considered as able to make decisions and exercise choice to achieve his / her own interest on the market. In a [...] "society of individualized consumers", consumer choice was associated with freedom.But it must be also pointed out that consumers exercise their decisional power on the market subject to a variety of influences, such as, among other things, marketing strategies. The range of things in respect of which consumer choice is exercised are largely prearranged and the consumers' resources to make a free and informed choice are, for lots of them, significantly limited in financial and <b>time</b> <b>terms.</b> This is a fundamental assumption of inbound marketing, which values most of all the fact to enable companies and company-related information to be easily found by consumers.The development and deployment of information technology has enabled consumers to exercise a certain degree of influence. In this context consumer becomes more involved in determining the specification of products on the market.However, this is not a radical change of the economic system's logic. In facts this is a development that can be still ascribed to [...] "the necessity of continuing to innovate in a competitive economic marketplace in order to generate increasing consumer interest and sales, reduce staffing costs, and raise turnover".Approaching the end of the 20th century, the emphasis has been placed no longer on product and sales but on the consumers, which can be defined as marketing approach.It has been recognized that consumers are not clueless and their desires are not false, but they are not autonomous and are [...] "heavily conditioned at several levels by shared group dynamics and experiences".In the 21st century, [...] "as consumers have grown accustomed to the employment of familiar designs, layouts, and display techniques", trying to catch their attention and subsequently arousing their interest through advertising and marketing have become more challenging. This requires new marketing methods to be found and developed.2010s' consumer has radically changed from the one of even some years ago, and what was effective and influential in a relative recent past is not necessarily so today. Today's consumer is more easily influenced by peers in his/her social network and shared experiences than by an aggressive advertising campaign. The consumer of the 21st century [...] "is informed, time-compressed, and difficult to impress", and can be only influenced by what he / her takes for relevant and informative. Consumers [...] "don't want to have products pushed at them", but are willing to search for them if they are enabled to. [...] "Relevance and information attributes" [...] have become to be felt as [...] "key missing ingredients from most … ads". Inbound marketing recognizes this feeling. Consumers feel the need for more information and they have started to look for it from every media device they have, above all Internet. Websites, social media, blogs, etc. are making the purchasing process more and more social. The consumer no longer follows or trusts the information showed in an ad. Indeed, consumers trust more their peers' comments, friends' opinions, and experiences. Starting a conversation with them is becoming of paramount importance in this scenario.Traditional marketing services industry is being redefined through the action of more nimble and tech savvy marketing agencies, that integrate digital services into traditional methods, Of course, the depth, versatility, and drive of their talent is crucial for making organizations achieve higher purposes.|$|E

The Pg refractor is presumed to be granitic and metamorphic rocks southwest of the San Andreas Fault and volcanic or ultrabasic rocks within or beneath the Franciscan Formation northeast of the San Andreas Fault. Small <b>time</b> <b>terms</b> (< 0. 4 sec) are associated with exposed granitic basement in the Santa Cruz and Gabilan ranges and with exposures of the Franciscan Formation in the central Diablo Range and in the Santa Teresa Hills (south of San Jose).
