5|$|Davis was {{selected}} by the Philadelphia Eagles as the eighth overall selection in the 1991 NFL Draft, one pick after former Tennessee teammate Charles McRae {{was selected}} by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. It {{was the first time}} in NFL history that two former college teammates who played the same position were drafted back-to-back. Davis was the first draft pick by new Eagles head coach Rich Kotite. The Eagles traded up from the 19th pick with the Green Bay Packers <b>to</b> <b>select</b> Davis, giving Green Bay the 19th selection (which was used on cornerback Vinnie Clark) and a first-round pick in the 1992 NFL Draft. The pick in 1992 ended up being the 17th selection, and the Packers traded it to the Atlanta Falcons for quarterback Brett Favre on February 10, 1992. The Falcons then traded the pick to the Dallas Cowboys (who used it <b>to</b> <b>select</b> cornerback Kevin Smith) and received the 19th selection (used <b>to</b> <b>select</b> running back Tony Smith) and a fourth round pick (used <b>to</b> <b>select</b> cornerback Frankie Smith).|$|E
