5|$|This in turn {{blocks the}} flow of fluids in the eye, leading to a painful {{increase}} in intra-ocular pressure (glaucoma) and often irreparable optic nerve damage, leading <b>to</b> <b>visual</b> field loss and eventual blindness.|$|E
5|$|An {{increase}} in intracranial pressure {{may lead to}} impairment of the optic nerves (II) due to compression of the surrounding veins and capillaries, causing swelling of the eyeball (papilloedema). A cancer, such as an optic glioma, may also impact the optic nerve (II). A pituitary tumour may compress the optic tracts or the optic chiasm of the optic nerve (II), leading <b>to</b> <b>visual</b> field loss. A pituitary tumour may also extend into the cavernous sinus, compressing the oculuomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve (VI), leading to double-vision and strabismus. These nerves may also be affected by herniation of the temporal lobes of the brain through the falx cerebri.|$|E

5|$|As {{reflector}} sight designs advanced after World War II, {{giving the}} pilot {{more and more}} information, they eventually evolved into the head-up display (HUD). The illuminated reticle was eventually replaced by a video screen at {{the focus of the}} collimating optics that not only gave a sighting point and information from a lead-finding computer and radar, but also various aircraft indicators (such as an artificial horizon, compass, altitude and airspeed indicators), facilitating the visual tracking of targets or the transition from instrument <b>to</b> <b>visual</b> methods during landings.|$|E
5|$|At {{least a dozen}} {{recordings}} {{were issued}} {{in the wake of}} the success of the Nonesuch recording, and the work enjoyed significant exposure in a number of artistic media worldwide. The work was repeatedly used by filmmakers in the 1990s and onwards to elicit a sense of pathos or sorrow, including as an accompaniment to a plane crash in Peter Weir's Fearless (1993), and in the soundtrack to Julian Schnabel's Basquiat (1996). An art gallery in Santa Fe, New Mexico opened an exhibit in 1995 dedicated entirely <b>to</b> <b>visual</b> art inspired by the piece.|$|E

5|$|Cassette {{copies of}} the band's first album, Opium, began {{circulating}} through the underground clubs and bars of Hamburg in 1984. KMFDM released its next album, What Do You Know, Deutschland?, in December 1986. It was recorded from 1983 to 1986, {{with some of the}} songs recorded by Konietzko and Watts before Esch {{was a member of the}} band, and indeed, before the band officially existed. Skysaw Records gave the album a second UK release in 1987 and introduced the band <b>to</b> <b>visual</b> artist Aidan Hughes, usually credited as Brute!. Hughes redesigned the album's cover, and went on to design almost every KMFDM album cover.|$|E
5|$|Dead reckoning, {{in animals}} usually known as path integration, means the putting {{together}} of cues from different sensory sources within the body, without reference <b>to</b> <b>visual</b> or other external landmarks, to estimate position {{relative to a}} known starting point continuously while travelling on a path {{that is not necessarily}} straight. Seen as a problem in geometry, the task is to compute the vector to a starting point by adding the vectors for each leg of the journey from that point.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>visual</b> warnings, ambulances can {{be fitted}} with audible warnings, sometimes known as sirens, which can alert people and vehicles {{to the presence}} of an ambulance before they can be seen. The first audible warnings were mechanical bells, mounted to either the front or roof of the ambulance. Most modern ambulances are now fitted with electronic sirens, producing a range of different noises which ambulance operators can use to attract more attention to themselves, particularly when proceeding through an intersection or in heavy traffic.|$|E
50|$|In a {{study done}} by B. Forster, C. Cavina-Pratesi, S. M. Agolioti, and G. Berlucchi(2001), normal {{observers}} responded faster <b>to</b> simultaneous <b>visual</b> andtactile stimuli than <b>to</b> single <b>visual</b> or tactile stimuli. RT <b>to</b> simultaneous <b>visual</b> and tactile stimuli was also faster than RT <b>to</b> simultaneous dual <b>visual</b> or tactile stimuli. The advantage for RT to combined visual-tactile stimuli over RT to the other types of stimulation could {{be accounted for by}} intersensory neural facilitation rather than by probability summation. These effects can be ascribed to the convergence of tactile and visual inputs onto neural centers which contain flexible multisensory representations of body parts.|$|R

50|$|At least 65% of the {{population}} are considered <b>to</b> be <b>visual</b> learners, those who absorb and recall information best by reading as opposed <b>to</b> listening. <b>Visual</b> learners benefit significantly from reading transcripts and watching or listening instead of only listening to spoken information.|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that aposematism and mimicry is less evident in marine invertebrates than terrestrial insects because predation is a more intense selective force for many insects, which also disperse as adults rather than as larvae and have much shorter generation times. Further, {{there is evidence that}} fish predators such as blueheads may adapt <b>to</b> <b>visual</b> cues more rapidly than do birds, making aposematism less effective.|$|E
5|$|Of all Serbian epic or {{historical}} figures, Marko {{is considered to}} have given the most inspiration <b>to</b> <b>visual</b> artists; a monograph on the subject lists 87 authors. His oldest known depictions are 14th-century frescoes from Marko's Monastery and Prilep. An 18th-century drawing of Marko {{is found in the}} Čajniče Gospels, a medieval parchment manuscript belonging to a Serbian Orthodox church in Čajniče in eastern Bosnia. The drawing is simple, unique in depicting Marko as a saint and reminiscent of stećci reliefs. Vuk Karadžić wrote that during his late-18th-century childhood he saw a painting of Marko carrying an ox on his back.|$|E
5|$|Tapping felt {{acting on}} the new show went a little easier when filming Carter scenes with Bill Dow ("Bill Lee"), {{with whom she had}} {{previously}} worked on Stargate SG-1. She said another factor that made acting on Atlantis easier was the welcoming cast and crew of the series. Tapping's hair was longer than it was during her time on SG-1, and the military approved of the change {{as long as it was}} worn up. To save money on visual effects, the crew built set pieces to represent some of the buildings on M7R-227 and placed them in front of the puddle jumper set. Another measure taken as a substitute <b>to</b> <b>visual</b> effects was to cast mime artists as the frozen Asurans.|$|E

5|$|The dust {{present in}} the {{interstellar}} medium is opaque <b>to</b> <b>visual</b> light. It is more transparent to far-infrared, {{which can be used}} to observe the interior regions of giant molecular clouds and galactic cores in great detail. Infrared is also used to observe distant, red-shifted galaxies that were formed much earlier {{in the history of the}} Universe. Water vapor and carbon dioxide absorb a number of useful portions of the infrared spectrum, so high-altitude or space-based telescopes are used for infrared astronomy.|$|E
5|$|The episode's {{antagonistic}} bug {{creature was}} created {{by means of a}} prosthetic suit that was worn by a stuntwoman. The suit was highly ridiculed behind the scenes. To fix the perceived issues with the monster, the production team gave the film <b>to</b> <b>visual</b> effects editor Laurie Kallsen-George, who digitally altered the footage until it was deemed suitable. The episode's title is a reference to Folie à deux, a form of insanity shared by two people. It usually begins with one person who conceives of a delusional belief and then spreads it to another; thus, those two share the same delusion.|$|E
5|$|The optic tectum allows {{actions to}} be {{directed}} toward points in space, most commonly in response <b>to</b> <b>visual</b> input. In mammals it is usually {{referred to as the}} superior colliculus, and its best-studied function is to direct eye movements. It also directs reaching movements and other object-directed actions. It receives strong visual inputs, but also inputs from other senses that are useful in directing actions, such as auditory input in owls and input from the thermosensitive pit organs in snakes. In some primitive fishes, such as lampreys, this region is the largest part of the brain. The superior colliculus is part of the midbrain.|$|E

5|$|Key Sounds Label is a Japanese {{independent}} {{record label}} formed in 2001 as {{a brand of}} the publishing company VisualArt's. Key Sounds Label was formed to catalog and release music related <b>to</b> <b>visual</b> novels produced by the brand Key, also under VisualArt's, known for developing such titles as Kanon and Air. Excluding two albums and one single that were released by Key and VisualArt's before the label's formation, the majority of releases on the label all have a basis from one of Key's titles. There are other albums and singles on the label {{not directly related to}} the visual novels, such as two singles by Lia and one album by Riya. Unlike typical record labels, Key Sounds Label does not license any of the artists featured on albums and singles released on the label.|$|E
5|$|The {{aesthetics}} of film noir {{are influenced by}} German Expressionism, an artistic movement of the 1910s and 1920s that involved theater, photography, painting, sculpture and architecture, as well as cinema. The opportunities offered by the booming Hollywood film industry and then the threat of Nazism, led to the emigration of many film artists working in Germany who {{had been involved in}} the Expressionist movement or studied with its practitioners. M (Fritz Lang 1931), shot only a few years before his departure from Germany, is among the first crime films of the sound era to join a characteristically noirish visual style with a noir-type plot, in which the protagonist is a criminal (as are his most successful pursuers). Directors such as Lang, Robert Siodmak and Michael Curtiz brought a dramatically shadowed lighting style and a psychologically expressive approach <b>to</b> <b>visual</b> composition (mise-en-scène), with them to Hollywood, where they made some of the most famous classic noirs.|$|E
5|$|Vision {{seems to}} be more {{important}} to the pelagic ray in finding food than in other stingrays. Compared to other members of its family, this species has less than one-third the density of electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini on its underside. The ampullae also cover a smaller area, though not as small as in eagle rays, and are more evenly distributed between the ventral and dorsal surfaces. This ray can detect an electric field of well under 1 nV/cm at a distance of up to , and may be able to pick up the minute electric fields produced by moving sea water. The lateral line of the pelagic stingray, a complex system of mechanoreceptors that detect nearby movement and ocean currents, remains similar to other stingrays in covering a greater area on the ventral than the dorsal surface. However, this species is less responsive to mechanical than <b>to</b> <b>visual</b> stimuli.|$|E
