40|$|Individual donors coming {{together}} to pool their funds and to make grants, that is <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> giving circles. <b>Emerging</b> as a new trend in the United States, giving circles are typically organized around a particular issue or area of interest and are considered a high engagement form of philanthropy. The circle's grantmaking functions, proposal review, and site visits engage members in a participatory process that, when combined with the increased impact of pooled charitable resources, has strong appeal to many donors. The Baltimore Giving Project, housed at the Association of Baltimore Area Grantmakers (USA), has supported the growth of many giving circles since 2000. Its report details the growth and lessons learned from two of these circles...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> <b>The</b> Cosmonaut <b>emerged</b> {{from two}} main sources: a) the conversations between Nicolás Alcalá and Bruno Teixidor (the main {{creative}} minds behind the project’s visual looks) about conspiracies, the Lost Cosmonauts theories and the Soviet space program; and b) the poetry book Poetics for Cosmonauts, written by Henry Pierrot. Throughout {{the time it}} was developed, the main plot core underwent a lot of changes, although some key elements remained through all the process, mainly the principal plot element (the return of an astronaut to Earth after a long trip to the Moon). After the reading of Poetics for Cosmonauts, the script changed to its present form. The preproduction for the short film started in October-November 2008.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} some of <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> {{discipline of}} Web Science, whose ambition is {{to shape the}} future development of the World Wide Web and the research agenda that that requires. There are formidable obstacles to this ambition, not least the large scale of the Web, the most complex piece of technology ever devised, and the co-constitution of the Web with its communities of users. Web Science must therefore straddle and integrate computing, mathematics, complexity and network studies on the one hand, together with studies of the social context, using the methods of sociology, law and economics on the other. The chapter defines the Web and differentiates it from the Internet, upon whose infrastructure it depends. Web Science is {{shown to be a}} type of reflective practice, made problematic by its scale and by the complexity of its interrelation with embedding societies; in particular it is difficult to integrate the micro-scale of the protocols which define it, with the macro-scale of the social effects that follow from widespread use of particular systems. The example of the development of the Web of Linked Data is used to illustrate difficulties and potential solutions...|$|R
40|$|Imagine a {{teleconferencing}} system that’s so realistic, so natural, {{that you}} feel you could reach out and shake a participant’s hand, even though the individual may be sitting in a room hundreds or even thousands of miles away. That’s <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> telepresence, an <b>emerging</b> teleconferencing technology that’s designed to not only connect people together but {{to make them feel}} like they’re all collaborating together inside the same room. Telepresence provides an immersive meeting experience based on the highest possible levels of audio and video clarity. Ideally, participants are life-sized. Ide-ally, every sound, gesture, and facial expression are replicated in high-definition (HD) video and high-fidelity surround sound. The ultimate goal is to make telepresence and in-person meetings virtually indistinguishable from each other. “Telepresence has a great potential for getting people to work together collaboratively, efficiently, and naturally regardless of their physical location,” observes Zhengyou Zhang, a principal researcher focusing on telepresenc...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> {{this project}} <b>emerged</b> while I was making organ {{recordings}} {{for a school}} project. The relation between the musician, the sound technicians and the producer was an issue that called for my attention. The influence of this specific environment on the performer and the music itself, comparing it to a live performance, {{and the search for}} possible differences in musical interpretation and performance constitute the main focus of this work. It is composed of four major parts. The first part of the background reflects on the essential aspects of this subject and also offers some historical examples and quotations from important musicians and other personalities. The second part refers to the artistic part of this work. It describes the organ in Norrfjärden, where the recordings have been made, its historical background and special characteristics. The chosen repertoire was the major organ work “Nun freut euch lieben Christen g´mein”, composed by Dieterich Buxtehude. The section on this work goes from a biography of the composer, through considerations on the text and theological background of the hymn, to the musical analysis of the piece, also focusing on my own artistic choices. The third section of this thesis {{is the result of the}} investigation made, leading to a conclusion. Finally, the artistic part is composed of three different recordings of the same piece, at the same instrument, with the same performer, but with varying recording conditions. The first recording is a live concert version, the second an unedited version, where the performer plays the music only to the microphones without any audience or studio production, the third is a produced version, where the performance is generally guided by the producer, who also does the final editing.
