5|$|Streamside camps offered wood, water, {{and some}} {{protection}} from the hazards of open land. The prairie could be dangerous in time of native unrest, and trade ceased entirely for a time during the Dakota War of 1862. Prairie fires, driven by winds, were a risk in dry spells. Wet weather turned rivers into torrents, approaches to streams into bogs, and worn paths into morasses. Blizzards could strand <b>traders</b> <b>and</b> threaten them with starvation. Insects harassed both the <b>traders</b> <b>and</b> their draft animals, depriving them of sleep and weakening them.|$|E

5|$|An Indian trail used by fur <b>traders,</b> <b>and</b> Red River carts pulling {{settlers}} effects was {{the first}} path between Moosomin and Fort Ellice, Manitoba. The transcontinental CPR paralleled this trail when coming through in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Chad's {{official}} {{languages are}} Arabic and French, but over 100 languages and dialects are spoken. Due to {{the important role}} played by itinerant Arab <b>traders</b> <b>and</b> settled merchants in local communities, Chadian Arabic has become a lingua franca. Chad submitted an application to join the Arab League as a member state on 25 March 2014, which is still pending.|$|E
5|$|Details on Buffalo's {{early life}} are sparse. Although {{he appears to}} have been favored by British <b>traders</b> <b>and</b> {{decorated}} by British authorities, few Ojibwa from Lake Superior fought in either the American Revolution or the War of 1812. There is no record of Buffalo participating.|$|E

5|$|The abacus, {{also called}} a {{counting}} frame, is a calculating tool {{that was in}} use centuries before {{the adoption of the}} written modern numeral system and is still widely used by merchants, <b>traders</b> <b>and</b> clerks in Asia, Africa, and elsewhere; it dates back to at least 2700–2300BC, when it was used in Sumer.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea mink}} was first {{described}} in 1903, after its extinction; information regarding its external appearance and habits stem from speculation and from accounts made by fur <b>traders</b> <b>and</b> Native Americans. It may have exhibited behavior {{similar to the}} American mink, in that it probably maintained home ranges, was polygynandrous, and had a similar diet, though more seaward-oriented. It was probably found on the New England coast and the Maritime Provinces, though its range may have stretched further south during the last glacial period. Conversely, its range may have been restricted solely to the New England coast, specifically the Gulf of Maine, or just to nearby islands. Largest of the minks, the sea mink was more desirable to fur <b>traders</b> <b>and</b> became extinct in the late 19th or early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Artists and {{craftsman}} operated as corporations (guilds) {{rather than}} as individual business. Inscriptions mention guilds of weavers, oilmen, artisans, basket and mat makers and fruit sellers. A Saundatti inscription refers to an assemblage {{of all the people}} of a district headed by the guilds of the region. Some guilds were considered superior to others, just as some corporations were, and received royal charters determining their powers and privileges. Inscriptions suggest these guilds had their own militia to protect goods in transit and, like village assemblies, they operated banks that lent money to <b>traders</b> <b>and</b> businesses.|$|E

5|$|Characteristic of {{the turn}} of the 10th century in most Polish tribal {{settlement}} areas was a particular intensification of gord building activity. The gords were the centers of social and political life. Tribal leaders and elders had their headquarters in their protected environment and some of the tribal general assemblies took place inside them. Religious cult locations were commonly located in the vicinity, while the gords themselves were frequently visited by <b>traders</b> <b>and</b> artisans.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{location}} {{in the middle of}} the trade network of the ancient world, the cultural and social landscape of the city was complex, as the inhabitants had to deal with <b>traders</b> <b>and</b> envoys who brought with them different customs from distant regions. The inventories of gifts presented to deities from the royal palace indicate that Qatna used the sexagesimal numeral system.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, <b>traders</b> <b>and</b> Jesuit missionaries from Portugal reached Japan for {{the first}} time, {{initiating}} direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West. This allowed Oda Nobunaga to obtain European technology and firearms, which he used to conquer many other daimyōs. His consolidation of power began what {{was known as the}} Azuchi–Momoyama period (1573–1603). After Nobunaga was assassinated in 1582 by Akechi Mitsuhide, his successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi unified the nation in 1590 and launched two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597.|$|E

5|$|Early fur <b>traders</b> <b>and</b> explorers noted {{regional}} trading centers, and {{archaeological evidence}} has shown {{some to be}} of considerable antiquity. One such trading center in the Weiser area existed as early as 4,500 years ago. The Fremont culture {{may have contributed to}} the historic Shoshones, but it is not well understood. Another poorly understood early cultural component is called the Midvale Complex. The introduction of the horse to the Snake River Plain around 1700 helped in establishing the Shoshone and Northern Paiute cultures.|$|E
5|$|English colonial <b>traders</b> <b>and</b> explorers from Carolina, {{since its}} {{founding}} in 1670, had established a substantial trading network across the southeastern part of the continent that extended {{all the way to the}} Mississippi. Its leaders had little respect for the Spanish in Florida, but they understood the threat posed by the French arrival on the coast. Both Carolina governor Joseph Blake and his successor James Moore articulated visions of expansion to the south and west at the expense of French and Spanish interests.|$|E
5|$|Five years later, Buffalo was {{presented}} with the Treaty of La Pointe covering his lands. Acting Superintendent of Indian Affairs Henry Stuart, who was promoting development of the Lake Superior copper industry, led the negotiations for the US government. No record of the negotiations was made. But materials written by missionaries, <b>traders,</b> <b>and</b> the Ojibwa through their agent indicated that Stuart used bullying and outright deception to force the Ojibwa to accept the terms.|$|E

5|$|Ganesha was {{particularly}} worshipped by <b>traders</b> <b>and</b> merchants, {{who went out}} of India for commercial ventures. From approximately the 10th century onwards, new networks of exchange developed including the formation of trade guilds and a resurgence of money circulation. During this time, Ganesha became the principal deity associated with traders. The earliest inscription invoking Ganesha before any other deity {{is associated with the}} merchant community.|$|E
5|$|Largely {{bypassed}} by {{the early}} non-native explorers, fur <b>traders,</b> <b>and</b> settlers because of its remote location, the region attracted newcomers in quantity when prospectors found gold near Jacksonville in the Rogue River valley in 1851. This {{led to the creation}} of Jackson County in 1852 and, after gold discoveries near Waldo in the Illinois River valley, the creation of Josephine County, named for the daughter of a gold miner. Even with an influx of miners and of settlers who farmed donation land claims, Josephine County's population was only 1,204 in 1870.|$|E
5|$|Overhill Cherokee was {{the term}} for the Cherokee people located in their {{historic}} settlements {{in what is now}} the U.S. state of Tennessee in the Southeastern United States, {{on the west side of}} the Appalachian Mountains.
