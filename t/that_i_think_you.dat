Coyle noted her enthusiasm for the character, particularly towards his design; she has given noteworthy praise towards his arms, as they [...] "are amazing, and the timing has been really good for this show, so much so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> feel the impact of those arms." [...] Coyle also believes that people can connect with the character on different levels. Similarly, Sean Galloway—a character designer on the series—said that he is [...] "probably one of [...] favorites" [...] to have designed.|$|E
500|$|Cannibal Holocaust premiered on 7 February 1980 in the Italian city of Milan. Although {{the courts}} later confiscated the film {{based on a}} citizen's complaint, the initial {{audience}} reaction was positive. After seeing the film, director Sergio Leone {{wrote a letter to}} Deodato, which stated, [...] " [...] Dear Ruggero, what a movie! The second part is a masterpiece of cinematographic realism, but everything seems so real <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> will get in trouble with all the world." [...] In the ten days before it was seized, the film had grossed approximately $2 million; in Japan it grossed $21 million, becoming the second highest-grossing film of that time after E.T. the Extraterrestrial. Internationally, it grossed $200 million.|$|E

A writer of Fox News Channel {{commented that the}} judges [...] "didn't want to stop {{listening}} to Melanie Amaro" [...] while she was singing a [...] "soaring rendition" [...] of the ballad. Simon Cowell said, [...] "I brought this show to America because I believe {{some of the greatest}} singers in the world are from this country, and you just proved <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you,</b> based on that performance tonight, to me, should be the winner of 'The X Factor,' because you're going to represent this country all over the world." [...] L.A. Reid also commented, [...] "That wasn't a $5 million performance. That was a $50 million performance." [...] Sarah Maloy of Billboard magazine felt that her performance was [...] "as powerfully and passionately [...] as she did the first time". Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post praised Amaro's rendition, writing that it contained a [...] "determined look on her face, lots of generous spreading of the arms, and plenty of big notes". Amaro eventually emerged as the winner of The X Factor, performing this song for the final time.|$|E

2500|$|In her 2007 {{book tour}} Rowling further {{discussed}} the topic, stating [...] "It wasn't really exclusively <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{can see in}} the Ministry even before it's taken over, there are parallels to regimes we all know and love." [...] She prefaced the remark, saying [...] "People like to think themselves superior and that if they can pride themselves in nothing else they can pride themselves on perceived purity." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} aspect of Johnson's singing was his use of microtonality. These subtle inflections of pitch help explain why his singing conveys such powerful emotion. Eric Clapton described Johnson's music as [...] "the most powerful cry <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can find in the human voice." [...] In two takes of [...] "Me and the Devil Blues" [...] he shows {{a high degree of}} precision in the complex vocal delivery of the last verse: [...] "The range of tone he can pack into a few lines is astonishing." [...] The song's [...] "hip humor and sophistication" [...] is often overlooked. [...] "enerations of blues writers in search of wild Delta primitivism," [...] wrote Wald, have been inclined to overlook or undervalue aspects that show Johnson as a polished professional performer.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{politics}} and message in Harry Potter, Rowling explained, [...] "I wanted Harry to leave our world and find exactly the same problems in the wizarding world. So you have the intent to impose a hierarchy, you have bigotry, and this notion of purity, which is this great fallacy, but it crops {{up all over the}} world. People like to think themselves superior and that if they can pride themselves in nothing else they can pride themselves on perceived purity[...] It wasn't really exclusively <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can see in the Ministry even before it's taken over, there are parallels to regimes we all know and love." [...] She also said, [...] "You should question authority and you should not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all of the truth." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{connection}} with her {{portrayal of the}} bureaucratised Ministry of Magic and the oppressive measures taken by the Ministry in the later books (like making attendance to Hogwarts compulsory and the [...] "registration of Muggle-borns" [...] with the Ministry), Rowling has been asked {{whether there is a}} parallel with Nazism. She replied that [...] "It wasn't really exclusively <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can see in the Ministry even before it's taken over, there are parallels to regimes we all know and love." [...] Jennifer Barnett of People's Weekly World stated that the reader is drawn [...] "into the politics of the wizarding world—the 'Educational Decrees' from the toad-like Ministry of Magic representative, the high-level connections of 'war criminals' from the last rise of Voldemort, the prejudice against 'mudbloods' and 'half-breeds,'" [...] and suggested connections [...] "to the world we live in, to the similarities and differences between the Fudge administration and the Bush administration." [...] Julia Turner of Slate Magazine also interpreted Rowling's depiction of the ministration as criticism of the Bush and Blair administrations, suggesting the Ministry's security pamphlet recalls the Operation TIPS (Terrorism Information and Prevention System). University of Tennessee law professor Benjamin Barton notes what he considers to be libertarian aspects of Harry Potter in his paper, Harry Potter and the Half-Crazed Bureaucracy, published in the Michigan Law Review, stating that [...] "Rowling's scathing portrait of government is surprisingly strident and effective. This is partly because her critique works on so many levels: the functions of government, the structure of government, and the bureaucrats who run the show. All three elements work together to depict a Ministry of Magic run by self-interested bureaucrats bent on increasing and protecting their power, often {{to the detriment of the}} public at large. In other words, Rowling creates a public-interest scholar's dream—or nightmare—government." ...|$|E
