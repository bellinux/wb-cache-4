60|$|Mr Evans's {{mind was}} too truly pious for a wicked expletive to cross it; but {{a bad man}} expressing the curate's feeling would have said <b>that</b> <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> was a damned fool.|$|E
60|$|The morning came at {{last and}} found him feverish and parched, unable to move. Mrs Clinton sent for the doctor, a slow, {{cautious}} Scotchman, in whose wisdom Mrs Clinton implicitly relied, since he always agreed with her own idea of her children's ailments. This prudent gentleman ventured to assert <b>that</b> <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> had caught cold and had something wrong with his lungs. Then, promising to send medicine and come again next day, went off on his rounds. Mr Clinton grew worse; he became delirious. When his wife, smoothing his pillow, {{asked him how he}} felt, he looked at her with glassy eyes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} {{an analytical}} approach to explaining a nearly constant high job approval rating of president Clinton between January, 1998 and February, 1999. Despite all the controversy and massive information exposure to mostly unflattering news about Mr. Clinton; the public, {{in nearly all}} major opinion polls expressed their wish <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton</b> be allowed to complete his second term in the office. The analytical approach {{is based on the}} information entropy theory of Shannon. The model is tested using the data from the polling archives of ABC/Washington Post. The results are confirmed by the Kendall's ÃÂ„ statistics...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, you cannot do it. It {{is evident}} <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> hates {{the sight of}} you, and no wonder; and she won't have you at any price. You had best be {{contented}} with what you have got." ...|$|R
2500|$|Both {{mechanisms}} contributed in {{the case}} of Hillary Clinton, who has been called, and has publicly called herself, [...] "Hillary". Peter Funt, of Candid Camera, wrote in a February 21, 2007 New York Times op-ed piece, [...] "The Mononym Platform": [...] "Someone has apparently decided <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> will be the first major single-name candidate since 1952, when Ike's P.R. gurus realized that 'Eisenhower' was tough to fit on a bumper sticker... In an apparent attempt to model her marketing on the likes of Madonna, Beyoncé and Cher, Mrs. Clinton's site proclaimed: [...] 'Today, Hillary took the first step...'..." [...] In an interview with Hillary Clinton published in Salon.com, the interviewer acknowledged receiving reader accusations of sexism whenever he referred to Clinton in print as [...] "Hillary" [...] (in contrast with male candidates who were almost always referred to by their last names), although he stated it was primarily to avoid confusion with her husband Bill Clinton.|$|R
5000|$|After {{this she}} {{submitted}} a sketch for a gown for Clinton {{to wear to}} the 1993 Inaugural Ball. Clinton selected Phillips' sketch over those submitted from other designers, and Phillips went about creating Clinton's custom designed [...] "shimmering" [...] violet lace-and-mousseline gown. Phillips said of Clinton's choice that, [...] "It's a fairy-tale sort of dress, very traditional, which really isn't typical of my style ... I {{thought it was a}} beautiful design, but I never thought it would be selected since there were a million other gorgeous gowns submitted by designers far more established than I." [...] Nicole Fischelis, then-fashion director of Saks Fifth Avenue, said of the gown that, [...] "I think Sarah Phillips is part {{of a new generation of}} young designers who are very contemporary and have a definite feel for quality clothes ... I think it's terrific <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> would pick someone young and unknown to the public. It shows a certain kind of spirit and open-mindedness." ...|$|R

50|$|Clarke's book Against All Enemies is also {{a crucial}} {{complement}} to the September 11 panel's failure to condemn Mr. Clinton's failure to capture or kill bin Laden {{on any of the}} eight to 10 chances afforded by CIA reporting. Mr. Clarke never mentions that President Bush had no chances to kill bin Laden before September 11 and leaves readers with the false impression <b>that</b> he, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton</b> and <b>Mr.</b> Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, did their best to end the bin Laden threat. That trio, in my view, abetted al Qaeda, and if the September 11 families were smart they would focus on the dereliction of Dick Clarke, Bill Clinton and Sandy Berger and not the antics of convicted September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui.|$|R
6000|$|Tea {{was brought}} in, and they drank it, talking of parish matters, <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> discreetly trying to pump the curate. Was it really true <b>that</b> <b>Mrs</b> Palmer of No. 17 Adonis Road drank so terribly? ...|$|R
60|$|Now, it chanced one {{day that}} the senior partner of the firm was summoned to serve on a jury at a coroner's inquest, and <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton,</b> {{furnished}} with the excuse <b>that</b> <b>Mr</b> Haynes was out of town, was told to go in his stead. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> had never performed that part of a citizen's duties, for on becoming a householder he had hit upon the expedient of being summoned for his rates, so that his name should be struck off the coroner's list; he was very indifferent to the implied dishonour. It was with some curiosity, therefore, that he repaired to the court {{on the morning of}} the inquest.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{arrived at}} the mortuary, a gay red and white building, which had been newly erected and consecrated by a duke with much festivity and rejoicing. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> was sworn with the other jurymen, and with them {{repaired}} to see the bodies on which they were to sit. But <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> was squeamish.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton,</b> as before, {{had gone}} out, but <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{did her best}} to {{entertain}} the two doctors. The specialist, who talked most incessantly himself, was extremely impatient of other people's conversation.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{crossed her}} hands over her stomach and looked at her husband with self-satisfaction. But <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> was awake, staring in front of him with wide-open, fixed eyes; various {{thoughts}} confusedly ran through his head.|$|R
60|$|The Clintons {{lived in}} the fifth house down in the Adonis Road, {{and the house was}} {{distinguishable}} from its fellows by the yellow curtains with which <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> had furnished all the windows. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> was a woman of taste. Before marriage, the happy pair, accompanied by Mrs Clinton's mother, had gone house-hunting, and fixed on the Adonis Road, which was cheap, respectable and near the station. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> would dearly have liked a house on the right-hand side of the road, which had nooks and angles and curiously-shaped windows. But <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> was firm in his refusal, and his mother-in-law backed him up.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton,</b> in fact, became worse. He {{came home}} later and later every night, {{and his wife}} was disgusted {{at the state of}} uncleanness which his curious wanderings brought about. He refused to take the baths which <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{prepared}} for him. He was more silent than ever, but when he spoke it was in biblical language; and always hovered on his lips the enigmatical smile, and his eyes always had the strange, disconcerting look. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> perseveringly made him take his medicine, but she lost faith in its power when, one night at twelve, <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> brought home with him a very dirty, ragged man, who looked half-starved and smelt distinctly alcoholic.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I never!' said <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton,</b> quite aghast; and as {{she walked}} by the flower girl, snorted at her and looked so savagely that the poor little maiden quite started. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> walked very slowly, {{stopping}} {{now and then to}} look at a couple of women seated on a doorstep, or the children round an ice-cream stall. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> saw him pay a penny and give an ice to a little child who was looking with longing eyes at its more fortunate companions as they licked out the little glass cups. He remained quite a long while watching half a dozen young girls dancing to the music of a barrel organ, and again, to his wife's disgust, <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> gave money.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> looked helplessly at her friend; {{she feared}} {{something}} was wrong, and she didn't {{know what to}} do. But the neighbour, with a significant look, pointed to the Daily Telegraph, which was lying on a chair. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> brightened up {{and took it to}} her husband.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, my man,' he said, as <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> at last came in, 'what are you {{complaining}} of?... One moment,' he added, as <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{was about}} to reply. He opened his notebook {{and took out a}} stylographic pen. 'Now, I'm ready for you. What are you complaining of?' ...|$|R

60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> was disgusted to see {{her husband}} enter a public-house.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> crumbled up his bread, rolling {{it about}} on the table.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{began to}} cry, {{and the doctor}} looked at her compassionately.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> embraced Rupert in silence, {{she was too}} {{affected}} for speech.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> did {{not reply}} for several minutes; the women waited in silence.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> turned {{towards her}} and again {{put his hand}} on her shoulder.|$|R
60|$|On Sunday, <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> put on Sunday clothes, {{and heading}} the little {{procession}} formed by <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{and the two}} children, went to church, carrying in his hand a prayer book and a hymn book. After dinner he took a little walk with his wife along the neighbouring roads, avenues and crescents, examining {{the exterior of the}} houses, stopping now and then to look at a garden or a well-kept house, or trying to get a peep into some room. <b>Mr</b> and <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> criticised as they went along, comparing the window curtains, blaming a door in want of paint, praising a well-whitened doorstep....|$|R
5000|$|For <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Jordan's roles {{have been}} manifold: Golfing companion. Smoother of ruffled {{feathers}} (he put the president {{back in touch}} with Zoë Baird after the withdrawal of her nomination to be attorney general). Consoler in chief (after <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton</b> was defeated for re-election as governor in 1980, after the suicide of Vincent W. Foster Jr. in 1993). Conduit to the high and mighty (he took <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton</b> in 1991 to the Bilderberg conference in Germany, an exclusive annual retreat for politicians and businessmen). Go-between (he told Mike Espy he had to go as secretary of agriculture, helped win Warren Christopher a larger role as secretary of state and sounded out Gen. Colin L. Powell for a Cabinet job).|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{looked at}} him; {{he was quite}} calm, and smilingly {{returned}} her glance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'In my bed!' screamed <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton.</b> 'Not if I know it! 'Ere, you,' she said, {{addressing}} the man, and pushing past her husband. 'Out you get! I'm {{not going to}} 'ave tramps and loafers in my 'ouse. Get out!' <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> was an energetic woman, and a strong one. Catching hold of her husband's stick, and flourishing it, she opened the front door.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> did not answer; {{his wife}} walked rapidly {{backwards}} and forwards, wringing her hands.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{looked up}} from his nails, which he was paring with a pair of pocket scissors.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{heaved a}} deep sigh. 'And {{what do you}} think 'ad better be done now?' she asked.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{reached his}} office at a quarter to ten, except when the train, by some mistake, arrived up to time, {{when he arrived at}} nine-thirty precisely. On these {{occasions}} he would sit in his room with the door open, awaiting the coming of the office-boy, who used to arrive two minutes before <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> and was naturally much annoyed when the punctuality of the train prepared him a reprimand.|$|R
60|$|But <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{stood outside}} the {{mortuary}} door, meditating, and the coroner's officer remarked {{that it was a}} wet day.|$|R
5000|$|She adds: [...] "Sexism is insidious, {{unconscious}} and affects {{women as well}} as men. Just because women didn't turn out in big enough numbers for <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> does not mean we should dismiss the troubling sexism and misogyny that marred the campaign... The fact so many women in America voted for Mr Trump over <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> is a get-out-of-jail-free card: female voters weren't bothered, so it can't be sexist. It can, and it is." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{month later}} a small party were {{assembled}} in Captain Clinton's bungalow. Mrs. Humphreys {{was standing with}} a baby in each arm. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> was lying upon a sofa crying bitterly. Captain Clinton was {{walking up and down}} the room, hot and angry. The surgeon of the regiment was standing grave and sympathetic by <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton.</b> Sergeant Humphreys was in the attitude of attention by the door, with an anxious troubled expression on his face.|$|R
