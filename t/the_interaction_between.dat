It begins by discussing the four roles that national courts can perform in relation to international adjudication: substitution, implementation, contestation, and normative development. It then distinguishes between the multiple functions exercised by international courts in relation to national courts. These include substitution, review, and normative development. It is argued that <b>the</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> international and national courts, like <b>the</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> international and national legal orders, may range from cooperative dialogue and willingness toward recognition and accommodation, to outright competition...|$|R

5|$|One well-understood {{example of}} {{mutualism}} is <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> protozoa and methanogenic archaea in the digestive tracts {{of animals that}} digest cellulose, such as ruminants and termites. In these anaerobic environments, protozoa break down plant cellulose to obtain energy. This process releases hydrogen as a waste product, but high levels of hydrogen reduce energy production. When methanogens convert hydrogen to methane, protozoa benefit from more energy.|$|E

The plasma co-rotating with Jupiter impinges on the trailing side of the Ganymedian magnetosphere much like the solar wind impinges on the Earth's magnetosphere. The main difference is the speed of plasma flow—supersonic in the case of Earth and subsonic in the case of Ganymede. Because of the subsonic flow, there is no bow shock off the trailing hemisphere of Ganymede.|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gases}} are nearly ideal gases under {{standard}} conditions, but their {{deviations from the}} ideal gas law provided important clues {{for the study of}} intermolecular interactions. The Lennard-Jones potential, often used to model intermolecular interactions, was deduced in 1924 by John Lennard-Jones from experimental data on argon before the development of quantum mechanics provided the tools for understanding intermolecular forces from first principles. The theoretical analysis of these interactions became tractable because the noble gases are monatomic and the atoms spherical, which means that <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> the atoms is independent of direction, or isotropic.|$|E
