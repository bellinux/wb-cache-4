Proper {{management}} of irrigated forest plantations requires special management aids. <b>Tariff</b> <b>tables</b> {{are among the}} most important tools in managing forest plantations. This study presents <b>tariff</b> <b>tables</b> for Eucalyptus camaldulensis and E. microtheca in the Rahad Agricultural scheme. For the construction of the <b>tariff</b> <b>tables,</b> 114 trees of Eucalyptus camaldulensis and 75 trees of E. microtheca were felled and their stems measured in order to determine their diameters at breast height and actual volumes. Using regression techniques, the relationships between diameters and volumes of the stems of each group of data were determined. The strong correlation between these parameters (diameter and volume) made it possible to construct the <b>tariff</b> <b>tables.</b> Using those <b>tariff</b> <b>tables,</b> volumes of trees of the above mentioned tree species can be calculated by measuring diameters only. This saves a lot of time spent in forest inventories. The <b>tariff</b> <b>tables</b> presented here are applicable for the irrigated plantations of the Rahad Agricultural Scheme. Their use elsewhere or for those of coppice origin requires careful tests. Khartoum University Pres...|$|R

50|$|On 31 October 2011 {{a second}} {{review of the}} Feed in Tariffs for low carbon {{electricity}} generation was announced {{which is likely to}} take effect from 12 December 2011. The rates for small photovoltaic installations have been reduced from 43.3p/kWh to 21 pence/kWh. The reason for the second review is that FITs for PV were being taken up too quickly and that the DECC funding allocation for FITs was in danger of being exceeded. A further reason is that the cost of installing PV panels has reduced by around 50% and therefore the FITs had become less of an encouragement to install PV panels and more of an incitement to profit from excessive subsidies.

This new methodology is characterized by capturing qualitative elements of exposed participants that old pricing methods were not able to capture. The results showed that, among the variables chosen for the model, the income variable has an inverse relationship with the risk of healthcare expenses. Individuals with higher earnings tend to utilize the health plan less than usual. Male gender individuals have higher expenditures than female ones and it is reflected in the tariff statistically determined. Finally, the model was able to generate <b>tariff</b> <b>tables</b> that can be charged to plan’s participants covering all average risk (expected medical utilization) ...|$|R

Therefore, in orderto build the <b>tariff</b> <b>tables</b> necessary to volume estimation of stands,P. _AyRAL, Leader of the first Section of the Research Station,worked on a method of « stratified sample » whose applicationhas already given excellent results. The most important charactersare 1) Place of the trees in stories of vegetation (t, 2, 3); 2) Crown dev elopinent (: B, C); 3) Quality of the stem (D, T, r, etc [...] .). The stratified sample should include sample tree of each class ofsuch characters in every girth class, proportionally with the correspondingnumber of steins in the stand in order to avoid a systematicdistortion. Volume measurements of standing trees. necessaryto that system, are realized with the « Fcole Forestière » entrainminladder. One must then prepare, with this representative sample, a tarifftable, suitable to the stand after its thinning. The practical basis ofstudies was constitued of seven clear felled stands, most accuratelymeasured, tree by tree, after numeration. Instead of the graphical method, improper by many ways,A 1;Ani E has worked on a mathematical method, less subjective andallovfing calculation of the standard-error of volume estimation.

40|$|Thailand imports a {{large volume}} of table grapes from the United States of America. The Thai – U. S. Free Trade Agreement (FTA) will reduce tariff on imports and thus import value changes which will affect related sectors of Thai economy system. The {{objectives}} {{of this study are}} to estimate trend of importing quantity and value of table grapes from the U. S. caused by the reduction of import tariff under the FTA, and to evaluate the impact of the tariff reduction on related sectors of the Thai economy. The result found that the relative price of grape and real capita income elasticities of demand are - 1. 1 and 4. 7, respectively. The relative price was expected to decrease while the real capita income increases. This would raise the import value and lead to the accumulation of 19, 520. 4 million baht from 2007 to 2017. The sectors related to the fruit orchard sector as an intermediate input users were least affected by 13. 62 million baht decrease of the economic value. In contrast, the intermediate input sectors would be most affected by 6, 587. 80 million baht decrease of the economic value. These sectors were agricultural services sector, fertilizer, pesticide and insecticide sector, wholesale trade sector, basic chemicals sector, banking service sector, cutlery and hand tools sector, petroleum refinery gas separated plant sector, retail trade sector, and plastic wares sector.

And most of the distor-tion traceable to agricultural policies is generated by import barriers. For that reason, negotiating wider market access in agriculture {{is critical to the}} success of the Doha Round. 1 The World Trade Organization (WTO) Agriculture Framework Agreement of July 2004 calls for significant tariff cuts using a tiered formula that imposes larger percentage cuts in higher <b>tariffs.</b> (See <b>table</b> 1 for a summary of all of the provisions.) This proposed approach is a vast improvement over the average-cut formula applied in the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture, which allows countries to meet their commitments through large proportional reductions in tariffs that were already low and small reductions in high tariffs. The new formula still will require substantial cuts in tariffs before meaningful trade liberalization is realized. This is because of the prevalence in agriculture of tariff peaks (a small number of tariff lines protect the bulk of domestic production), binding “overhang ” (bound tariffs are above applied tariffs), “water ” in the tariff (tariff reductions initially have no impact), and tariff escalation (higher tariffs o...|$|R
