5|$|Fast pace {{of life in}} Viet Nam {{during the}} decades of {{integration}} and development witnesses {{the changes in the}} traditional ao dai. <b>This</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that the traditional ao dai is disappearing from Vietnamese life. Yet, it is becoming more adaptable to these modern days.|$|E
5|$|Kitsune are {{believed}} to possess superior intelligence, long life, and magical powers. They are a type of yōkai, or spiritual entity, and the word kitsune is often translated as fox spirit. However, <b>this</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that kitsune are ghosts, nor that they are fundamentally different from regular foxes. Because the word spirit is used to reflect a state of knowledge or enlightenment, all long-lived foxes gain supernatural abilities.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that a Category5 {{hurricane}} cannot form {{outside of}} an El Niño event. The entire year of 1959 was neither an El Niño or a La Niña, {{but it had}} one Category5 hurricane (Patsy). Most of 1973 was during a La Niña, which reduces tropical cyclone activity in the eastern Pacific, yet Hurricane Ava, a Category 5 hurricane, formed in June of that year.|$|E
5000|$|In 1958, the Anti-Prostitution Law (baishun-bōshi-hou) was enforced, thus officially {{abolishing the}} name Akasen and the districts. However, <b>this</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> the sex related {{industry}} disappeared.|$|R
50|$|Women {{were not}} allowed to hold public office positions, due to male {{contempt}} for women. <b>This</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean,</b> however, that they were unable to participate publicly. They could serve as court witnesses, petition signers, and bond guarantors.|$|R
25|$|In 1943, Italy overthrew Mussolini {{and became}} a co-belligerent with the Allies. <b>This</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> any change in status for Italian POWs however, since due to the labour {{shortages}} in the UK and the USA, they were retained as POWs there.|$|R
5|$|Two of the Jain {{references}} to this parable {{are found in}} Tattvarthaslokavatika of Vidyanandi (9th century) and it appears twice in the Syādvādamanjari of Ācārya Mallisena (13th century). According to Mallisena, whenever anyone takes a partial, unconditional view of the ultimate reality, and denies the possibility of another aspect of that reality, it is an instance of the above parable and a defective view. Mallisena goes further in his second reference to the above parable and states that all reality has infinite aspects and attributes, all assertions can only be relatively true. <b>This</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> scepticism or doubt is the right path to knowledge, according to Mallisena and other Jain scholars, but that any philosophical assertion is only conditionally, partially true. Any and all viewpoints, states Mallisena, that do not admit an exception are false views.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. <b>This</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that we can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E
5|$|Peking opera follows other {{traditional}} Chinese arts in emphasizing meaning, rather than accuracy. The highest aim of performers {{is to put}} beauty into every motion. Indeed, performers are strictly criticized for lacking beauty during training. Additionally, performers are taught to create a synthesis between the different aspects of Peking opera. The four skills of Peking opera are not separate, but rather should be combined in a single performance. One skill may take precedence at certain moments during a play, but <b>this</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that other actions should cease. Much {{attention is paid to}} tradition in the art form, and gestures, settings, music, and character types are determined by long held convention. This includes conventions of movement, which are used to signal particular actions to the audience. For example, walking in a large circle always symbolizes traveling a long distance, and a character straightening his or her costume and headdress symbolizes that an important character is about to speak. Some conventions, such as the pantomimic opening and closing of doors and mounting and descending of stairs, are more readily apparent.|$|E
50|$|On his {{ascent to}} the throne, Philip quickly showed {{that while he}} was young, <b>this</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that Macedon was weak. In the first year of his rule, he pushed back the Dardani and other tribes in the north of the kingdom.|$|R

5000|$|The {{space station}} the Professor {{inadvertently}} destroys is {{a parody of}} Star Trek: Deep Space Nines namesake station.

50|$|On 31 January 2006 the newspaper, Sächsische Zeitung, {{reported}} that the guardians of this historic Halle monument were permitting the engine to be stationed elsewhere for a length period; but <b>this</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that its export was planned.

5000|$|According to Kalupahanna, Nagarjuna insisted that... All {{experienced}} phenomena {{are empty}} (sunya). <b>This</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> {{that they are}} not experienced and, therefore, non-existent; only that they are devoid of a permanent and eternal substance (svabhava). Since they are experienced, they are not mere names (prajnapti).|$|R
2500|$|Songun is North Korea's [...] "Military First" [...] policy, which prioritizes the Korean People's Army in {{affairs of}} state and allocates {{national}} resources to the [...] "army first".

25|$|LGS {{seizures}} {{are often}} treatment resistant, but <b>this</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that treatment is futile.

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> {{that banks}} can - even in theory - create money without limit.

50|$|The {{appellation}} of pope became {{recognized as}} a title, but <b>this</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that it represented a title different or higher than the title of patriarch.

25|$|The early Irish {{laws are}} devoid {{of a state}} centred {{enforcement}} mechanism and {{at least some of}} the judges were outside the state apparatus. <b>This</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that the laws were ineffective, rather the methods of enforcement of legal procedures worked in such a way to fit with the conditions of society.|$|R

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that if {{mathematics}} is separate from material concerns, it is useless; or that algebra, {{which is more}} abstract, is more useless.

5|$|The 5-inch/38 {{functioned as}} a dual purpose gun.

25|$|Robin Collins {{responds}} {{that energy}} conservation objections misunderstand {{the role of}} energy conservation in physics. Well understood scenarios in general relativity violate energy conservation and quantum mechanics provides precedent for causal interactions, or correlation without energy or momentum exchange.

There are many different interpretations of what tzniut means, so people from different communities will often dress differently.|$|E
