5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Elsie and Frances {{admitted}} that <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> were faked, using cardboard cutouts of fairies copied from a popular children's {{book of the}} time, but Frances maintained that the fifth and final photograph was genuine. <b>The</b> <b>photographs</b> {{and two of the}} cameras used are on display in the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford, England.|$|E
5|$|These {{additions}} effectively transformed <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> into {{a work of}} fiction. Subsequent posters expanded {{upon the}} character, adding their own visual or textual contributions.|$|E
5|$|All the motifs {{can vary}} {{considerably}} in appearance {{according to the}} weaver. Colours, sizes and shapes can all be chosen according to taste and the tradition in a given village or tribe; further, motifs are often combined, as illustrated in <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> above. To give some idea of this variability, a few alternative forms are shown in the table.|$|E

25|$|Infringement of the {{copyright}} which subsists {{in a photograph}} can be performed through copying <b>the</b> <b>photograph.</b> This is because the owner of {{the copyright}} in <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> has <b>the</b> exclusive right to copy <b>the</b> <b>photograph.</b> For there to be infringement of the copyright in a photograph, there must be copying of a substantial part of <b>the</b> <b>photograph.</b>|$|R
25|$|Other {{researchers}} consider <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> a hoax. Roy Mackal {{requested to}} use <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> in his 1976 book. He received the original negative from MacNab, but discovered it differed from <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> {{that appeared in}} Whyte's book. The tree at the bottom left in Whyte's was missing from the negative. It is suspected that <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> was doctored by re-photographing a print.|$|R
5|$|Beato's {{photographs}} of the Second Opium War {{are the first to}} document a military campaign as it unfolded, doing so through a sequence of dated and related images. His {{photographs of}} the Taku Forts represent this approach on a reduced scale, forming a narrative recreation of the battle. The sequence of images shows the approach to the forts, the effects of bombardments on the exterior walls and fortifications, and finally the devastation within the forts, including the bodies of dead Chinese soldiers. <b>The</b> <b>photographs</b> were not taken in this order, as <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> of dead Chinese had to be taken first—before the bodies were removed; only then was Beato free to take the other views of the exterior and interior of the forts.|$|E
5|$|Eakins {{made several}} on-site oil {{sketches}} and photographic studies before painting The Swimming Hole. It is unknown whether <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> were taken before the oil sketches were produced {{or vice versa}} (or, indeed, whether they were created on the same day).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gladys {{was active}} during the Apollo 7 spaceflight mission, and astronauts aboard took several {{pictures}} of the hurricane. Later, researchers were able to compare <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> to airforce reconnaissance data, radar, and local weather networks, the first such hurricane to be observed with such varied data.|$|E
50|$|Note that no model {{release is}} needed for the act of taking <b>the</b> <b>photograph.</b> Rather, if needed, the model release applies to the {{publication}} of <b>the</b> <b>photograph.</b> Liability rests solely with the publisher, except under special conditions. The photographer is typically not the publisher of <b>the</b> <b>photograph,</b> but usually licenses <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> to someone else to publish. It is typical for the photographer to obtain the model release not merely because he is present {{at the time and}} can get it, but also because it gives him more opportunity to license <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> later to a party who wishes to publish it.|$|R
5000|$|American and British {{intellectual}} property lawyers Mary M.

5|$|In 1935 Tange {{began the}} {{tertiary}} studies he desired at University of Tokyo's architecture department. He studied under Hideto Kishida and Shozo Uchida. Although Tange {{was fascinated by}} <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> of Katsura villa that sat on Kishida's desk, his work was inspired by Le Corbusier. His graduation project was a seventeen-hectare (42-acre) development set in Tokyo's Hibiya Park.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{two of the}} {{original}} columns were resited at Northwest 10th Avenue between Everett and Flanders Streets. The Regional Arts & Culture Council was searching for photographs showing the murals in their original location for an ongoing restoration project. In 2006, Randy Shelton reconstructed the artworks on the columns using <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> for reference.|$|E
5|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> in Beato's albums were hand-coloured, a {{technique}} that in his studio successfully applied the refined skills of Japanese watercolourists and woodblock printmakers to European photography.|$|E
50|$|Treating <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> {{as if it}} was {{an actual}} immigrant, Ma tells the narrator that <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> has come to move in. The narrator’s {{response}} is: “I don’t really know what she is talking about but I say ‘O.K.’ anyway,” suggesting the alienation and challenge of intergenerational remembering.Because <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> is addressed towards the mother, the mother recognizes herself as the child, the grandparents as the parents. Since the mother is taking {{on the role of the}} child, she dislodges the identity of the narrator. Because the mother perceives <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> as addressed towards herself, <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> offers no connection to the narrator. Actually, it dislocates the narrator from her identity.|$|R
50|$|From <b>the</b> beginning, <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> is not {{presented}} {{as an object}} to be viewed, but as a force which disturbs the narrator’s somewhat settled family. Although <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> is not accompanied with text or a written message, to the mother, the picture is a demand, a message which tells {{of a time when}} the mother had been disowned.Because <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> is loaded with deep emotion and grief for the mother, “she loses herself, literally her self, to it entirely” (8). But for the daughter, who does not associate much experience with <b>the</b> <b>photograph,</b> <b>the</b> picture does not offer any sort of access.|$|R
50|$|Art defines what <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> is, just as <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> defines who I am; in {{the same}} way the words I craft tell the secrets of my heart.|$|R
5|$|Several {{photographs}} {{are at the}} Musée d'Orsay in Paris, {{and at least one}} is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) in New York. The MET occasionally puts <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> on display with other Nadar works; a 1995 exhibition featured two of the series.|$|E
5|$|The {{first five}} seasons {{of the series}} were mainly filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia; {{production}} of the show's sixth season, however, was based in Los Angeles, California. Several of the scenes were filmed on the sets from NYPD Blue, whose sets were located just across from The X-Files studios. All of Fellig's cameras were borrowed from the University of California's Museum of Photography. Many of <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> were used courtesy of Corbis. The production staff of The X-Files were tasked with not only creating <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> that Fellig {{was supposed to have}} taken, but also with crafting each so that they would appear {{as if they had been}} taken from different times. Tom Day, the episodes property master, had to research popular government typefaces and printing technologies to make the pictures appear as historically accurate as possible. Geoffrey Lewis, who portrayed Fellig, was photographed several times and each photo was edited to give <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> the appearance of coming from different eras.|$|E
5|$|While {{trying to}} {{photograph}} a hen partridge on her nest, Cott waited for {{hours for the}} bird to return, finally taking some pictures of the empty nest before giving up.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>photograph</b> depicts eleven men eating lunch, {{seated on}} a girder with their feet {{dangling}} 840 ft above the New York City streets. <b>The</b> <b>photograph</b> was taken on September 20, 1932, on the 69th floor of the RCA Building during {{the last months of}} construction. According to archivists, <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> was in fact prearranged. Although <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> shows real ironworkers, it is believed that the moment was staged by Rockefeller Center to promote its new skyscraper. The photo appeared in the Sunday photo supplement of the New York Herald Tribune on October 2.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>photograph</b> of Silverstein on {{the back}} cover of the book has {{attracted}} attention. One writer described <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> as showing <b>the</b> author's [...] "jagged menacing teeth" [...] and [...] "evil, glaring eyes." [...] Another writer compared <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> to <b>the</b> one {{on the back}} of Where the Sidewalk Ends in which Silverstein resembles [...] "the Satanist Anton LaVey."

5|$|According to Schultheiss, Herrmann, and Jonas, {{although}} Trousseau {{had earlier}} suggested that surgery was a viable option, {{there is no}} evidence that the subject subsequently received treatment; They suggest several possible factors, including legal issues, the subject's refusal, or failed treatment followed by a lack of reporting, for the lack of surgery or evidence of such. Maisonneuve, partially shown in one of <b>the</b> <b>photographs,</b> treated another intersex patient in 1862.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Himmler {{assigned}} him to Hitler's headquarters staff as his liaison officer and {{representative of the}} SS. He was promoted {{to the rank of}} SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Waffen-SS on 10 June 1944. On 20 July 1944 Fegelein was present at the failed attempt on Hitler's life at the Wolf's Lair headquarters in Rastenburg, East Prussia and received a minor wound to his left thigh from the bomb blast. Fegelein often showed around <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> of the hanged men who had been executed {{as a result of this}} failed assassination attempt.|$|E
5|$|Ever since Joseph Merrick's days as {{a novelty}} exhibit on Whitechapel Road, his {{condition}} {{has been a source}} of curiosity for medical professionals. His appearance at the meeting of the Pathological Society of London in 1884 drew interest from the doctors present, but none of the answers nor the attention that Treves had hoped for. The case received only a brief mention in the British Medical Journal, and the Lancet declined to mention it at all. Four months later, in 1885, Treves brought the case before the meeting for a second time. By then, Tom Norman's shop on Whitechapel Road had been closed, and the Elephant Man had moved on. Without Merrick, Treves made do with <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> he had taken during his examinations. One of the doctors present at the meeting was Henry Radcliffe Crocker, a dermatologist who was an authority on skin diseases. After hearing Treves's description of Merrick, and viewing <b>the</b> <b>photographs,</b> Crocker proposed that Merrick's condition might be a combination of dermatolysis, pachydermatocele and an unnamed bone deformity, all caused by changes in the nervous system. Crocker wrote about Merrick's case in his 1888 book Diseases of the Skin: their Description, Pathology, Diagnosis and Treatment.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{doubt about}} the {{identification}} of <b>the</b> <b>photograph's</b> subject. It was believed that Frederico Borrell García was the subject, but he was actually killed at Cerro Muriano, and was shot while sheltered behind a tree.

5|$|For L.A. Noire, the {{development}} team recreated 1940s Los Angeles by using aerial photographs taken by daredevil Robert Spence. In a career spanning over 50 years, Spence took over 110,000 aerial photographs of Los Angeles. The team used <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> to create traffic patterns and public transport routes, {{as well as}} the location and condition of buildings. While striving to recreate an accurate model of 1947 Los Angeles, the team also took some artistic license, such as including the appearance of the film set for D. W. Griffith's Intolerance; the set had actually been dismantled in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Interest in the Cottingley Fairies {{gradually}} declined after 1921.

40|$|This thesis makes {{explicit}} how the viewer’s {{interpretation of}} a <b>photograph</b> of <b>the</b> American road trip is affected when the car is used as an explicit impact on <b>the</b> <b>photograph’s</b> frame or blurredness. The thesis focuses on <b>photographs</b> of <b>the</b> American road trip specifically as the road trip carries particular significance in American culture, as do both {{the car and the}} road. The research done establishes that the viewer’s relationship with (a) the photographer, and (b) <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> can be affected by the use of the car. In each case, the photographic styles discussed link the road and the car, as two connecting and connected objects that are important for the American road trip. By using the car to either create an additional frame, or to create two contrasting images within <b>the</b> <b>photograph,</b> <b>the</b> viewer, among others, becomes more aware of the presence of the photographer. By using the car to blur the surface of <b>the</b> <b>photograph,</b> <b>the</b> viewer can no longer look through <b>the</b> <b>photograph,</b> but looks at it before he/she can consider <b>the</b> object <b>photographed,</b> <b>the</b> American road...|$|R
