5|$|Hancock and the Democrats {{expected}} {{to carry the}} Solid South, {{while much of the}} North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign would involve a handful of close states, including New York {{and a few of the}} Midwestern states (national elections in that era were largely decided by closely divided states there). Practical differences between the major party candidates were few, and Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of waving the bloody shirt: reminding Northern voters <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> was responsible for secession and four years of civil war, and that if they held power they would reverse the gains of that war, dishonor Union veterans, and pay Confederate soldiers' pensions out of the federal treasury. With fifteen years having passed since the end of the war, and Union generals at the head of all of the major and minor party tickets, the appeal to wartime loyalties was of diminishing value in exciting the voters.|$|E
5|$|The state's {{conservative}} {{white voters}} began to support Republican presidential candidates by the mid-20th century. After this period, they supported Republicans for {{local and state}} offices as well, and most whites became Republican Party members. The party also attracted some minorities, but many have continued to vote for Democratic candidates. The shift to the Republican Party is much-attributed to the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> became increasingly liberal during the 20th century, and thus increasingly out-of-touch with the average Texas voter. As Texas was always a conservative state, voters switched to the GOP, which now more closely reflected their beliefs. Commentators have also attributed the shift to Republican political consultant Karl Rove, who managed numerous political campaigns in Texas in the 1980s and 1990s. Other stated reasons included court-ordered redistricting and the demographic shift {{in relation to the}} Sun Belt that favored the Republican Party and conservatism.|$|E

Washington missed many House votes, an issue that would come up in his campaign for mayor in 1983. Washington's major congressional accomplishment involved legislation to extend the Voting Rights Act, legislation that opponents had argued was only necessary in an emergency. Others, including Congressman Henry Hyde, had submitted amendments designed to seriously weaken the power of the Voting Rights Act.|$|E

500|$|Both parties knew that, {{with the}} end of Reconstruction and the disenfranchisement of black Southerners, the South would be solid for Hancock, netting 137 electoral votes of the 185 needed for victory. To this, the Democrats needed only add a few of the closely {{balanced}} Northern states; New York (35 electoral votes) and Indiana (15) were two of their main targets, but New Jersey and the Midwestern states were also battlegrounds.

500|$|In 1872, the Republican party split {{completely}} in half with Horace Greely nominated by the Liberal Republicans and Ulysses S. Grant again nominated {{by the more}} conservative Radicals. A few prominent Democratic Party leaders supported the Liberal Republican cause in Missouri. The result being <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> endorsed the reformer and Liberal Republican presidential candidate Horace Greeley. [...] Grant, though, remained very popular {{in the nation and}} won the national election of 1872 by a landslide. However, as more scandals broke out the Liberal Republicans became a party of reform who, along with the Democrats, wanted to purge the government from corruption. The wave of reform was beginning in 1875 with the Democrats controlling the House of Representatives. [...] Eventually, Grant put reformers on his cabinet as House investigations in 1875 were beginning to expose the [...] Whiskey Ring depleting tax revenues in the United States Treasury Department. [...] Newspapers exposed bogus agents in Interior Department in 1875. Navy Department corruption was exposed in 1876. These Grant reformers included Benjamin Bristow as Secretary of Treasury (1874), Edwards Pierrepont as Attorney General (1875), and Zachariah Chandler as Secretary of the Interior (1875). [...] No reformer was appointed to the Navy Department, however.|$|E

With a few months to go before the election, the Republicans switched tactics to emphasize the tariff.

Hancock made the situation worse when, attempting to strike a moderate stance, he said, [...] "The tariff question is a local question." [...] The ploy proved effective in uniting the North behind Garfield. In the end, fewer than two thousand votes, of the more than 9.2 million popular votes cast, separated the two candidates, but in the Electoral College Garfield had an easy victory over Hancock, 214 to 155.|$|E
