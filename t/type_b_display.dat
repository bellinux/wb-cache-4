40|$|Piliated Haemophilus influenzae <b>type</b> <b>b</b> strains <b>display</b> an {{enhanced}} adherence to human epithelial cells in vitro. However, clinical isolates, even from mucosal sites, are seldom piliated, although piliated populations can be selected from them. Experiments with rats have led some authors {{to suggest that}} piliation does not implement colonization by H. influenzae <b>type</b> <b>b.</b> Piliated populations were obtained from 35 strains by selection for adherence to human erythrocytes. One strain, H. influenzae H 305, simultaneously acquired an increased adherence to rat erythrocytes and buccal epithelial cells. In contrast to other strains, H. influenzae H 305 in piliated form was more effective than in nonpiliated form in the colonization of rats by intranasal inoculation. After the piliated inoculum, however, the colonies cultured from the nasal washes were negative for erythrocyte adherence. Thus, piliated H. influenzae <b>type</b> <b>b</b> strains have an apparent advantage to initiating colonization in the rat model but may give rise to nonpiliated progeny that are more readily cultivable from the mucosal surface...|$|R

Dietrichson claimed that <b>type</b> <b>B</b> <b>displays</b> an influence from early Christian and Roman basilicas. The style {{was assumed to be}} transferred via Anglo-Saxon and Irish architecture, where only the particular roof construction was local. Dietrichson emphasized the clerestory, arcades and capitals. The [...] "basilica theory" [...] was introduced by N. Nicolaysen in Mindesmærker af Middelalderens Kunst i Norge (1854). Nicolaysen worte: [...] "Our stave churches are now the only remaining of its kind, and according to the sparse records and known circumstances, it appears that nothing similar existed except perhaps in Britain and Ireland." [...] («Vore stavkirker er nu de eneste i sit slags, og saavidt sparsomme beretninger og andre omstændigheder lader formode, synes de heller ikke tidligere at have havt noget sidestykke med undtagelse af maaske i Storbritannien og Irland.») Nicolaysen further claimed that the layout and design may have been inspired by Byzantine architecture. Nicloaysen wrote: [...] "All facts suggest that the stave churches like the masonry churches and all medieval architecture in Western Europe originated from the Roman basilica." [...] («Alt synes at henpege paa, at forbilledet til vore stavkirker ligesom til stenkirkerne og overhovedet til hele den vesteuropæiske arkitektur i middelalderen er udgaaet fra den romerske basilika.») This theory was further developed by Anders Bugge and Roar Hauglid. Peter Anker believed that the influence from foreign masonry architecture was primarily in decorative deatils.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} how a group of four {{assembled}} simulated robots forming a linear structure can co-ordinate and move as straight and as fast as possible. This problem is solved in a rather simple and effective way by providing the robots with a sensor that detects the direction and intensity of the traction that the turret exerts on the chassis of each robot and by evolving their neural controllers. We also show how the evolved robots are able to generalize their ability in rather different circumstance by: (a) producing coordinated movements in teams with varying size, topology, and <b>type</b> of links; (<b>b)</b> <b>displaying</b> individual or collective obstacle avoidance behaviors when placed in an environment with obstacles; (c) displaying object pushing/pulling behavior when connected to or around a given object. ...|$|R
40|$|Aims In transthyretin amyloid (ATTR) {{amyloidosis}} various principal phenotypes {{have been}} described: cardiac, neuropathic, or a mixed cardiac and neuropathic. In addition, {{two different types}} of amyloid fibrils have been identified (type A and <b>type</b> <b>B).</b> <b>Type</b> <b>B</b> fibrils have thus far only been found in predominantly early-onset V 30 M and in patients carrying the Y 114 C mutation, whereas type A is noted in all other mutations currently examined as well as in wild-type ATTR amyloidosis. The fibril type is a determinant of the ATTR V 30 M disease phenotype. Tc- 99 m-DPD scintigraphy is a highly sensitive method for diagnosing heart involvement in ATTR amyloidosis. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the relationship between ATTR fibril composition and Tc- 99 m-DPD scintigraphy outcome in patients with biopsy-proven ATTR amyloidosis. Methods Altogether 55 patients with biopsy-proven diagnosis of ATTR amyloidosis and amyloid fibril composition determined were examined by Tc- 99 m-DPD scintigraphy. The patients were grouped and compared according to their type of amyloid fibrils. Cardiovascular evaluation included ECG, echocardiography, and cardiac biomarkers. The medical records were scrutinized to identify subjects with hypertension or other diseases that have an impact on cardiac dimensions. Results A total of 97 % with type A and none of the patients with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> fibrils <b>displayed</b> Tc- 99 m-DPD uptake at scintigraphy (p < 0. 001). Findings from analyses of cardiac biomarkers, ECG, and echocardiography, though significantly different, could not differentiate between <b>type</b> A and <b>B</b> fibrils in individual patients. Conclusion In ATTR amyloidosis, the outcome of Tc- 99 m-DPD scintigraphy is strongly related to the patients' transthyretin amyloid fibril composition...|$|R
40|$|P>The Arabidopsis {{thylakoid}} FtsH protease {{complex is}} composed of FtsH 1 /FtsH 5 (type A) and FtsH 2 /FtsH 8 (<b>type</b> <b>B)</b> subunits. <b>Type</b> A and <b>type</b> <b>B</b> subunits <b>display</b> {{a high degree of}} sequence identity throughout their mature domains, but no similarity in their amino-terminal targeting peptide regions. In chloroplast import assays, FtsH 2 and FtsH 5 were imported and subsequently integrated into thylakoids by a two-step processing mechanism that resulted in an amino-proximal lumenal domain, a single transmembrane anchor, and a carboxyl proximal stromal domain. FtsH 2 integration into washed thylakoids was entirely dependent on the proton gradient, whereas FtsH 5 integration was dependent on NTPs, suggesting their integration by Tat and Sec pathways, respectively. This finding was corroborated by in organello competition and by antibody inhibition experiments. A series of constructs were made {{in order to understand the}} molecular basis for different integration pathways. The amino proximal domains through the transmembrane anchors were sufficient for proper integration as demonstrated with carboxyl-truncated versions of FtsH 2 and FtsH 5. The mature FtsH 2 protein was found to be incompatible with the Sec machinery as determined with targeting peptide-swapping experiments. Incompatibility does not appear to be determined by any specific element in the FtsH 2 domain as no single domain was incompatible with Sec transport. This suggests an incompatible structure that requires the intact FtsH 2. That the highly homologous type A and <b>type</b> <b>B</b> subunits of the same multimeric complex use different integration pathways is a striking example of the notion that membrane insertion pathways have evolved to accommodate structural features of their respective substrates.

40|$|Plant cell {{walls are}} {{degraded}} by glycoside hydrolases that often contain noncatalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), which potentiate degradation. There are currently 11 sequence-based cellulose-directed CBM families; however, the biological {{significance of the}} structural diversity displayed by these protein modules is uncertain. Here we interrogate the capacity of eight cellulose-binding CBMs to bind to cell walls. These modules target crystalline cellulose (type A) and are located in families 1, 2 a, 3 a, and 10 (CBM 1, CBM 2 a, CBM 3 a, and CBM 10, respectively); internal regions of amorphous cellulose (type B; CBM 4 - 1, CBM 17, CBM 28); and the ends of cellulose chains (type C; CBM 9 - 2). Type A CBMs bound particularly effectively to secondary cell walls, although they also recognized primary cell walls. Type A CBM 2 a and CBM 10, derived from the same enzyme, displayed differential binding to cell walls depending upon cell type, tissue, and taxon of origin. <b>Type</b> <b>B</b> CBMs and the type C CBM displayed much weaker binding to cell walls than type A CBMs. CBM 17 bound more extensively to cell walls than CBM 4 - 1, even though these <b>type</b> <b>B</b> modules <b>display</b> similar binding to amorphous cellulose in vitro. The thickened primary cell walls of celery collenchyma showed significant binding by some <b>type</b> <b>B</b> modules, indicating that in these walls the cellulose chains do not form highly ordered crystalline structures. Pectate lyase treatment of sections resulted in an increased binding of cellulose-directed CBMs, demonstrating that decloaking cellulose microfibrils of pectic polymers can increase CBM access. The differential recognition of cell walls of diverse origin provides a biological rationale for the diversity of cellulose-directed CBMs that occur in cell wall hydrolases and conversely reveals the variety of cellulose microstructures in primary and secondary cell walls.

40|$|Neurones of the {{globus pallidus}} (GP) have been {{classified}} into three subgroups {{based on the}} visual inspection of current clamp electrophysiological properties and morphology of biocytin-filled neurones. Type A neurones (132 / 208; 63 %) were identified {{by the presence of}} the time- and voltage-dependent inward rectifier (Ih) and the low-threshold calcium current (It) giving rise to anodal break depolarisations. These cells were quiescent or fired regular spontaneous action potentials followed by biphasic AHPs. Current injection evoked regular activity up to maximum firing frequency of 350 Hz followed by moderate spike frequency adaptation. The somata of type A cells were variable in shape (20 × 12 μm) while their dendrites were highly varicose. <b>Type</b> <b>B</b> neurones (66 / 208; 32 %) exhibited neither Ih nor rebound depolarisations and only a fast monophasic AHP. These cells were spontaneously active while current injection induced irregular patterns of action potential firing up to a frequency of 440 Hz with weak spike frequency adaptation. Morphologically, these cells were the smallest encountered (15 × 10 μm), oval in shape with restricted varicose dendritic arborisations. Type C neurones were much rarer (10 / 208; 5 %). They were identified by the absence of Ih and rebound depolarisations, but did possess a prolonged biphasic AHP. They displayed large A-like potassium currents and ramp-like depolarisations in response to step current injections, which induced firing up to a maximum firing frequency of 310 Hz. These cells were the largest observed (27 × 15 μm) with extensive dendritic branching. These results confirm neuronal heterogeneity in the adult rodent GP. The driven activity and population percentage of the three subtypes correlates well with the in vivo studies (Kita & Kitai, 1991). Type A cells appear to correspond to type II neurones of Nambu & Llinas (1994, 1997) while the small diameter <b>type</b> <b>B</b> cells <b>display</b> morphological similarities with those described by Millhouse (1986). The rarely encountered type C cells may well be large cholinergic neurones.
