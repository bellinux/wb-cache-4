For example, Aramaic lacks the phonetic retroflex feature that appears among Prakrit dental stops, such as , and in Brahmi the symbols of the retroflex and non-retroflex consonants are graphically very similar, as if both had been derived from a single prototype. (See Tibetan alphabet for a similar later development.) Aramaic did not have Brahmi’s aspirated consonants ( [...] , , etc.), whereas Brahmi did not have Aramaic's emphatic consonants (...) , {{and it appears that}} these unneeded emphatic letters filled in for some of Brahmi's aspirates: Aramaic q for Brahmi kh, Aramaic ṭ (Θ) for Brahmi th (...) , etc. And just where Aramaic did not have a corresponding emphatic stop, p, Brahmi seems to have doubled up for the corresponding aspirate: Brahmi p and ph are graphically very similar, as if taken from the same source in Aramaic p. Bühler saw a systematic derivational principle for the other aspirates ch, jh, ph, bh, and dh, which involved adding a curve or upward hook to {{the right side of the}} character (which has been speculated to derive from h, [...] ), while d and <b>ṭ</b> (<b>not</b> to be confused with the Semitic emphatic [...] ) were derived by back formation from dh and ṭh.|$|E

[...] Hakkı Devrim, a television commentator and columnist for Radikal, said the idea insulted religion.

He [...] "advised Kanal <b>T</b> <b>not</b> to take the risk of airing such a show in Turkey".

[...] Rabbi David Rosen, director of the American Jewish Committee's Department for Interreligious Affairs, said in an interview about the show, [...] "as a Jew, it is against our world outlook to seek to proselytize". More generally, he stated that he thought the show was [...] "tasteless": [...] "Matters of faith, profession and lifestyle commitment are not something that should be decided on a reality show." [...] However, sociologist Nilüfer Narlı from Bahçeşehir University has said that the show demonstrates a [...] "rising curiosity toward religion" [...] over the past 10 years in Turkey. The Guardian and CBC News have remarked some people may see the show as promoting a further intolerance towards atheists in Turkey, a secular country where a large majority of the population is deeply religious. The opposition of the ruling Justice and Development Party has accused the show of having a secret [...] "Islamist agenda", which the series has denied.|$|E
