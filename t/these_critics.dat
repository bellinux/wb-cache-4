5|$|Other critics even {{in later}} years insisted that the {{character}} of Shylock is that of an outsider separated from society, that the Jewish Shylock represented an older form of justice, meant to be supplanted by the Christian view, represented by Portia, who argued for the prevalence of mercy. Shylock, <b>these</b> <b>critics</b> maintained, must be removed {{in order to allow}} society to attain a Christian form of peace. Hazlitt's view, however, has remained as a valid countervailing concept of the play, one that does not arrive at easy conclusions or take sides readily.|$|E
5|$|The Original All Blacks {{introduced}} several innovations to rugby in France and the British Isles. At {{the time}} of their tour many critics in the Northern Hemisphere blamed the use of the wing–forward for the All Blacks success. <b>These</b> <b>critics</b> claimed this player—who fed the ball into the scrum—would obstruct opposition players, and that the only reason they were not being penalised was due to poor refereeing. Their success however was due to a combination of factors, the most important being the team's discipline and organisation, which was described at the time as a scientific approach.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, who {{praised the}} enhanced vehicle physics, updated visuals, and strong sound design. Several reviewers also gave {{high marks for}} the game's Autovista mode. Some critics expressed frustration with Kinect features, and others also felt that the game was not enough of an innovation from its predecessor, Forza Motorsport 3. <b>These</b> <b>critics</b> did, however, concede that the game was a vast improvement over Forza Motorsport 3.|$|E

5|$|Even so, {{there is}} no {{shortage}} of criticism against Beyonce's particular brand of feminism. Many critics argue that Beyonce is part of the hyper sexualization of women in the pop industry since the 90's, something that occurred largely in sync with the explosion of the porn industry. Beyond this, some feminist critics argue that Beyonce fuels a culture of post-feminism. With songs like Girls (Who Run the World), Beyonce creates a mindset - particularly among teenage girls - that women are already outdoing men in every aspect of life. When the reality is, <b>these</b> <b>critics</b> say, there are still vast gender inequalities that keep them from doing so. The danger of post-feminism is that while they still exist, young people lack the language to label these inequalities as sexism.|$|E
5|$|When the {{restoration}} of the Sistine Chapel was announced, it sparked a barrage of queries and objections from art historians around the world. One of the most vocal of <b>these</b> <b>critics</b> was James Beck, of ArtWatch International, who issued repeated warnings about the possibility of damage to Michelangelo's work from over-strenuous restoration. An argument that was used repeatedly was that all the previous interventions had caused damage of one sort or another. Any restoration, as opposed to conservation, puts an artwork at risk. Conservation, on the other hand, aids in the preservation of the work in its present state and in prevention of further deterioration. Beck has written about his concerns in Art Restoration, the Culture, the Business and the Scandal.|$|E

30|$|Both the {{applications}} {{show that the}} methodology allows indicative evaluations {{on the use of}} the system and comparative analysis between different elementary components, providing a first identification of ‘weak’ links or nodes. The procedure allows narrowing the focus on particular areas/zones, for which then other tools may offer a better picture based on more and more circumstantial data; specific and detailed analyses should be carried out, by taking into account more in depth the actual configuration and the technical characteristics of <b>these</b> <b>critic</b> elements and the real composition of the traffic.|$|R

Foley, Michel Husson, David Laibman, Dominique Lévy, Simon Mohun, Gary Mongiovi, Ernesto Screpanti, Ajit Sinha, and Roberto Veneziani. The main idea of <b>these</b> <b>critics</b> is, that if equilibrium is let go of, then capitalism is an unpredictable chaos, and no coherent theory of prices or profits is possible anymore.|$|E

50|$|Another {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} the plan was the introduction of welfare income management among prescribed communities.

25|$|Fields such {{as social}} psychiatry, {{clinical}} psychology, and sociology may offer non-biomedical accounts of mental distress and disorder for certain ailments and are sometimes critical of biopsychiatry. Social critics believe biopsychiatry fails to satisfy the scientific method because they believe there is no testable biological evidence of mental disorders. Thus, <b>these</b> <b>critics</b> view biological psychiatry as a pseudoscience attempting to portray psychiatry as a biological science.|$|E
25|$|Some {{critics and}} historians in the 20th century, notably Lewis Mumford, {{argued that the}} real purpose of Haussmann's boulevards was {{to make it easier}} for the army to crush popular uprisings.

Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, who was an amateur magician, wrote in Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! (1985) that Geller was unable to bend a key {{for him and his}} son.

25|$|In 2014, {{the company}} faced {{significant}} criticism when it filed patent applications for designs that some claimed had been invented {{by members of}} its community and published to Thingiverse, such as the quick release extruder. Community members accused MakerBot of asserting ownership over their designs when those designs had been contributed {{with the understanding that}} they would remain open source. Then-CEO Bre Pettis released a statement dismissing <b>these</b> <b>critics,</b> citing patents that had been filed for unique inventions prior to any community-created designs, namely that the patent for the quick release extruder was originally filed in 2012 while the open source design was first published to Thingiverse in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Some {{critics say}} that breast cancer {{awareness}} has transformed the disease into a market-driven industry of survivorship and corporate sales pitches. Corporate marketing machines promote early detection of breast cancer, while also opposing public health efforts, such as stricter environmental legislation, that might decrease the incidence rate of breast cancer. <b>These</b> <b>critics</b> believe {{that some of the}} breast cancer organizations, particularly the highly visible Susan G. Komen for the Cure, have become captive companies that support and provide social capital to the breast cancer industry, including pharmaceutical companies, mammography equipment manufacturers, and pollution-causing industries, as well as large corporations, creating or exacerbating other problems.|$|E
25|$|First, {{they argue}} that {{comprehensive}} campaigns undermine the nature of collective activity (e.g., the union). Unions, <b>these</b> <b>critics</b> claim, are democratic organizations which empower members {{so that they may}} establish their own goals in the workplace and seek to meet them. The comprehensive campaign, however, replaces worker activism and involvement with staff-driven organizations. Instead of a powerful local union, the comprehensive campaign relies on the power of organizational partners in the community campaign. Worst of all, the comprehensive campaign diverts attention away from employees' goals and needs and toward the economic weaknesses of the employer, and It also subordinates the timing of the organizing drive to court calendars.|$|E

40|$|AUREOMYCIN has {{now been}} in {{clinical}} use {{for more than five}} years. The voluminous and still growing literature concerned with this antibiotic relates chiefly to its clinical trial in various diseases, there being relatively few studies of its distribution in various body fluids. This situation may be partly explained by technical difficulties resulting from instability of Aureo-mycin solutions at room temperature, particularly at a neutral pH. 1 In this paper we propose to summarize the knowledge concerning the absorption, diffusion and excretion of Aureomycin after oral administration, based on data in the literature and on more than 400 previously unreported deter-minations of the Aureomycin concentration in serum, cerebrospinal fluid and urine. Intravenous administration is discussed elsewhere. 2 " 6 METHODS A total of 87 subjects received Aureomycin t orally in a single dose of 500 mg. or in multiple doses of 200 or 500 mg. every six hours.
