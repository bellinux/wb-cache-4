5|$|Poor and fatherless, Garfield was mocked by {{his fellow}} boys, and {{throughout}} his life was very sensitive to slights. He escaped through reading, devouring all the books he could find. He left home at age 16 in 1847. Rejected by the only ship in port in Cleveland, Garfield instead found work on a canal boat, responsible for managing <b>the</b> <b>mules</b> that pulled it. This labor {{would be used to}} good effect by Horatio Alger, who penned Garfield's campaign biography in 1880.|$|E
5|$|The tale {{opens with}} the third and {{youngest}} son of a miller receiving his inheritance—a cat. At first, the youngest son laments, as the eldest brother gains the mill, and the middle brother gets <b>the</b> <b>mules.</b> The feline is no ordinary cat, however, but one who requests and receives a pair of boots. Determined to make his master's fortune, the cat bags a rabbit in the forest and presents it to the king as a gift from his master, the fictional Marquis of Carabas. The cat continues making gifts of game to the king for several months, {{for which he is}} rewarded.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{founding}} of the State of Israel, the Yishuv leadership anticipated an attack by regular Arab armies, of which Egypt's was the strongest in terms of manpower, arms and equipment. As such, Plan Dalet took stopping a potential Egyptian attack into account, and the Ad Halom (Sukrir) dual bridge over the Lakhish River was blown up as part of Operation Barak on May 12. In the eyes of the Givati command, this part of the operation was of marginal importance. A platoon from the 54th Battalion, two mules and 300 kilograms of explosives were allocated for it. <b>The</b> <b>mules</b> fled the scene, and the explosives were divided among the soldiers, who delivered them to the bridge. It took two attempts to destroy it, as some of the explosives did not work the first time.|$|E
50|$|At that moment, <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> enters, takes Pritcher's firearm, {{and reveals}} {{that he had}} {{followed}} them and taken {{the core of his}} fleet with him to destroy the Second Foundation. In an act of desperation, Channis removes Pritcher's conversion by <b>the</b> <b>Mule,</b> but restrains him so he cannot harm <b>the</b> <b>Mule.</b> Channis then states that if <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> kills him, Pritcher's bonds will be broken and he will kill <b>the</b> <b>Mule.</b> Defeated, <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> then proceeds to forcing the location of the Second Foundation out of Channis through mental torture. Broken, Channis reveals its location: Rossem.|$|R
5000|$|He helped Toran and Bayta Darrell abduct Magnifico Giganticus, {{the clown}} of <b>the</b> <b>Mule,</b> from Kalgan; ignorant of Magnifico's true {{identity}} as <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> himself. Pritcher initially opposed <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> and {{his attempts to}} conquer the Foundation, attempting to assassinate <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> in a suicide attack, but <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> was able to utilize his mental control to convert Pritcher {{into one of his}} most loyal followers, following which Pritcher was promoted to Colonel and eventually rose to the rank of Lieutenant General.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mule</b> chooses Channis to {{accompany}} General Han Pritcher on {{a search for}} the Second Foundation. <b>The</b> <b>Mule</b> tells Pritcher that he has chosen Channis for the task because he, <b>the</b> <b>Mule,</b> has chosen not to tamper with Channis's mind, thus leaving Channis more capable of making intuitive leaps which might lead him to his goal. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> has already determined that Channis {{is a member of the}} Second Foundation, and that he is attempting to lead <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> into a trap. <b>The</b> <b>Mule</b> intends to use this knowledge to set a trap of his own. He secretly places a hyper tracer on Channis's ship, allowing him and his fleet to follow their progress.|$|R
5|$|The {{station has}} been the site of several major {{accidents}} involving locomotives. In 1843, the Sloatsburg station {{was the site of}} a large accident by train full of milk bottles. On December 31, 1855, the railroad's Cincinnati Express was thrown off the tracks near the Sloatsburg station, when it tried to avoid a countrymen and his four mules, who were crossing the tracks. Three of <b>the</b> <b>mules</b> were killed and mutilated by the train, while the fourth died soon after. There was no damage to the cars or injuries to the passengers. In the early days of August 1856, a girl by the name of McGraff was injured by an oncoming train near the station after carelessly walking onto the tracks. The parents, who were in a poor state financially, was given $45 (1856 USD) in return for their troubles from the Board of Directors in nearby Goshen. On February 21, 1858, a train heading southbound experienced an accident when a brakeman, John Freeland, fell off the train and was run over. Freeland's legs were severed in the incident, and one arm was broken. They hurried Freeland southbound on a nearby train, but died by the time the train reached Paterson, New Jersey towards the hospital.|$|E
25|$|Football was Muhlenberg's first {{official}} varsity sport, beginning in 1900. But it wasn't until Ben Schwartzwalder became the coach in 1946 {{that the program}} really lifted off the ground. In his first year, Schwartzwalder guided <b>the</b> <b>Mules</b> to a 9-1 record and a national championship, defeating St. Bonaventure in the Tobacco Bowl. The following year, Schwartzwalder again led <b>the</b> <b>Mules</b> to a 9-1 record, with the only loss coming by one point to Temple. However, <b>the</b> <b>Mules</b> declined {{an invitation to the}} Tangerine Bowl.|$|E
25|$|After Schwartzwalder {{departed}} for Syracuse in 1949, <b>the</b> <b>Mules</b> {{fell off the}} national radar until the hiring of Mike Donnelly in 1997. Despite a rough 1-9 inaugural campaign, Donnelly quickly got the team turned around. From 2000–2004, <b>the</b> <b>Mules</b> won five straight Centennial Conference championships, and thus, earned five straight postseason berths. In 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Mules</b> again won the Centennial Conference, and received another berth in the NCAA playoffs, winning their first-round game before falling in the second round. Donnelly took his team back to the playoffs by winning the Centennial Conference again in 2008, where they fell in the first round, and again in 2010, with the same result.|$|E

5000|$|... ===Part I: Search By the Mule=== {{is about}} <b>The</b> <b>Mule's</b> search for <b>the</b> elusive Second Foundation, {{with the intent}} of {{destroying}} it. The executive council of the Second Foundation is aware of <b>The</b> <b>Mule's</b> intent and, {{in the words of the}} First Speaker, allows him to find it—"in a sense". <b>The</b> <b>Mule</b> sends two of his men on a search for the Second Foundation: Han Pritcher, who had once been a captain and a member of the underground opposition prior to being Converted to <b>the</b> <b>Mule's</b> service, and Bail Channis, an [...] "Unconverted" [...] man who has quickly risen through the ranks and impressed <b>The</b> <b>Mule.</b>|$|R

25|$|The plan {{came close}} to failure in Foundation and Empire because of the mutant called <b>The</b> <b>Mule.</b> Because <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> had psychic powers of mind control, he did not fit the model of {{interactions}} psychohistory was based upon. <b>The</b> <b>Mule</b> could influence men at a distance, unlike Second Foundation agents, who required eye contact. <b>The</b> <b>Mule</b> was eventually lured to a remote planet to destroy the Second Foundation. However, in so doing, he left his main fleet, which was turned against him by Second Foundation agents in his absence, thus ending his rule.|$|R
50|$|However, the Second Foundation springs its trap in {{a manner}} which proves a {{complete}} surprise to both Channis and the Mule: The Second Foundation has altered Channis' mind so that he honestly believes that Rossem is the Second Foundation, {{while the rest of}} the Second Foundation have left their real home world for Kalgan, where they will start an insurrection against <b>the</b> <b>Mule.</b> When <b>the</b> First Speaker of the Second Foundation informs <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> of this, <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> is shocked, and lets his defenses down momentarily. The First Speaker takes advantage of this, and mentally alters <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> so that he no longer seeks to expand his empire. <b>The</b> <b>Mule</b> returns to Kalgan, taking Pritcher with him and leaving Channis with the First Speaker.|$|R

25|$|White was {{not aware}} of the fate of Carleton's force until the next day, when Joubert sent a letter which also {{unilaterally}} granted an armistice to allow the dead to be buried. Carleton's force had been late setting out because <b>the</b> <b>mules</b> carrying his guns and reserve ammunition had not been properly controlled by inexperienced drivers and had been fractious. As dawn approached, Carleton feared that because of the late start, his force would be exposed at daybreak in the open plain between Pepworth Hill and the Nek. He therefore decided to occupy a hill known as Tchrengula just to the south of the Nek. As they climbed the hill, <b>the</b> <b>mules</b> bolted and startled British soldiers fired several shots, alerting the nearest Boers.|$|E
25|$|Boatmen {{reported}} that {{it was easier to}} navigate in the slackwaters than the aqueducts, since there was room for the water to move around the boat. Places like aqueducts, where there was little room for the water to move, were difficult for <b>the</b> <b>mules</b> to pull the boat through.|$|E
25|$|At first, {{the canal}} company thought to use steamboats in the slackwaters, since without mules, the canal boats {{had to use}} oars to move upstream, having no motive power. After many {{complaints}} of delays and dangers, the company provided a towpath so that <b>the</b> <b>mules</b> could pull the boats through the slackwaters.|$|E

While on Haven, Mis speculates {{about the nature of}} <b>the</b> <b>Mule.</b> He and Randu discuss the probability that <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> is a mutant and if so, what sort of abilities he might have. As they are debating the explanations to the peculiarities that have recently occurred, they come very close to the truth, but they do not realise that even as they speak, Haven is under the influence of <b>the</b> <b>Mule's</b> power. Mis and his companions leave for Trantor to find the location of the Second Foundation and a way to defeat <b>the</b> <b>Mule.</b> As they travel, Mis becomes more and more withdrawn. In fact, in the pages leading up to their arrival on Trantor, he is only barely mentioned in the plot. When he is described, it is typically as being in a pensive mood and oblivious to events happening around him. After landing on Trantor his condition worsens considerably.|$|R

50|$|A century later, {{an unknown}} {{outsider}} called <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> has begun taking over planets {{belonging to the}} Foundation at a rapid pace. The Foundation comes to realize <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> is a mutant, unforeseen in Seldon's plan, and that the plan cannot have predicted any certainty of defeating him. Toran and Bayta Darell, accompanied by Ebling Mis—the galaxy's current greatest psychologist—and a court jester familiar with <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> named Magnifico (whom they agree to protect, as his life is under threat from <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> himself), {{set out to find}} the Second Foundation, hoping {{to bring an end to}} <b>the</b> <b>Mule's</b> reign. Mis studies furiously in the Great Library of Trantor to decipher the Second Foundation's location in order to visit it and seek their help. He is successful and also deduces that <b>the</b> <b>Mule's</b> success stems from his mutation; he is able to change the emotions of others, a power he used to first instill fear in the inhabitants of his conquered planets, then to make his enemies devoutly loyal to him. Mis is killed by Bayta Darell before he can reveal the location; she realizes that Magnifico is in fact <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> and has been using his gifts to drive Mis forward in his research, so that he can learn the location himself and subjugate the Second Foundation also. Dismayed at having made a mistake which allowed Bayta to see through his disguise, <b>the</b> <b>Mule</b> leaves Trantor to rule over his conquered planets while continuing his search.|$|R
25|$|Barges {{were pulled}} by mules along the {{adjacent}} towpath, a power source employed {{even after the}} development of steam engines, since the bow wave from a faster steamboat would have damaged the channel. Children were often hired to lead <b>the</b> <b>mules</b> at first; in the canal's later years grown men were employed. They had to walk 15–20 miles (24–32km) a day, pump out the barges and tend the animals. For this they were paid about $3 a month.|$|E

25|$|During the Civil War, {{the railway}} station was garrisoned by Union troops. The Bog Wallow Ambush {{occurred}} in the vicinity in 1861. On December 28, 1862, Confederate cavalry under General J.E.B. Stuart raided the station. Stuart seized supplies from the area, destroyed a nearby bridge, monitored Union messages passing over the telegraph lines, and then famously sent a telegram to Union Quartermaster General Montgomery C.

50|$|Until the mid-20th century, <b>the</b> <b>mule</b> was {{a common}} sight on American farms. A sterile hybrid of horse and donkey, <b>the</b> <b>mule</b> was {{credited}} by owners with highly productive work habits as a draft animal in challenging conditions, especially those associated with plowing furrows in sticky clay soil. The application of {{the internal combustion engine}} to farm machinery, starting in the early 1900s, led to the end of use for <b>the</b> <b>mule.</b> Unlike domesticated animals that are fertile, <b>the</b> <b>mule</b> cannot parent its own kind and could not transition from draft animal to rural pet animal. In the mid-1900s, <b>the</b> headcount of <b>mules</b> in <b>the</b> U.S. central states was dropping towards zero.|$|R
