2500|$|He {{rejects the}} idea that <b>transnational</b> <b>terrorism</b> is uniquely Islamic. [...] "It is less the chance of an insurgent victory which creates a {{friendly}} environment for <b>transnational</b> <b>terrorism</b> than persistent internal conflict shattering control and restraint in a state.

Transnational terrorists exploit this. And protracted insurgency creates a general disregard for law and order. Organized crime and corruption blossom. Much of the population loses its natural aversion to violence.

2500|$|Metz {{warns that}} the {{paradigm}} may have changed. [...] "Insurgency matters today because it {{is linked to the}} phenomenon of <b>transnational</b> <b>terrorism.</b> Insurgents have long used terrorism in the operational sense, deterring those who supported the government and creating an environment of violence and insecurity to erode public trust in the regime. But now terrorism plays a strategic role as well. Insurgents can use terrorism as a form of long-range power projection against outsiders who support the government they are fighting. This could deter or even end outside assistance. It is easy to imagine, for instance, that the already fragile backing for American involvement in Iraq would erode even further if the Iraqi insurgents launched attacks in the United States. Even more important, an insurgent movement able to seize control of a state could support transnational terrorists. The idea is that insurgents have demonstrated an affinity for violence and extremism which would flavor their policies if they came to power." ...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} <b>transnational</b> {{islamist}} <b>terrorism</b> {{and with the}} policy of the European Union (EU) and the United States (U. S.) in countering the threat. It is assumed that it is the EU's policy that is more relevant given the recent evolution of the threat. The assumption is subsequently tested throughout the paper. In the opening part, {{the focus is on the}} international, or <b>transnational,</b> islamist <b>terrorism,</b> in particular its root causes, ideological background and organizational forms. Second chapter is devoted to the EU's counterterrorism policy, first from the institutional point of view, as that has obvious implications for the formulation and implementation of policy. Then, the prevailing perceptions of terrorism, basic tenets of strategy and some concrete measures are analyzed. The chapter dealing with the U. S. policy is structured analogously, even if the institutional aspects are omitted due to the obvious absence of EU-specific problems. Chapter four provides a comparison of both actors' policies, followed up by the fifth, final, chapter, with some concluding remarks. Most importantly, the initial assumption is assessed as valid, i. e., the European Union counterterrorism policy is found to be more relevant than that of the United States...|$|R
