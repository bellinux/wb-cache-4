5|$|The first crest {{to appear}} on a Partick <b>Thistle</b> kit was a <b>thistle</b> design, and every logo since has {{featured}} a <b>thistle.</b> The <b>thistle</b> appeared first in 1902, then again in 1909. It remained until 1978, when a new logo with the <b>thistle</b> housed inside a roundel was used. A modernist logo with the <b>thistle</b> on a rectangle was introduced in 1990, and the current crest was introduced in 2008.|$|E
5|$|In October 2013, millionaires {{and long}} time <b>Thistle</b> fans Chris and Colin Weir donated £750,000 to Partick <b>Thistle</b> {{to set up}} a new {{advanced}} youth academy. The academy was named the <b>Thistle</b> Weir Youth Academy and is run by former striker Gerry Britton.|$|E
5|$|Knights and Ladies of the <b>Thistle</b> {{may also}} be {{admitted}} to the Order of the Garter. Formerly, many, but not all, Knights elevated to the senior Order would resign from the Order of the <b>Thistle.</b> The first to resign from the Order of the <b>Thistle</b> was John, Duke of Argyll in 1710; the last to take such an action was Thomas, Earl of Zetland in 1872. Knights and Ladies of the <b>Thistle</b> {{may also be}} deprived of their knighthoods. The only individual to have suffered such a fate was John Erskine, 6th Earl of Mar who lost both the knighthood and the earldom after participating in the Jacobite rising of 1715.|$|E

500|$|The {{smallest}} municipality {{to produce}} a Stanley Cup champion team is Kenora, Ontario; the town had {{a population of about}} 4,000 when the Kenora <b>Thistles</b> captured the Cup in January 1907. Aided by future Hall of Famers Art Ross and [...] "Bad" [...] Joe Hall, the <b>Thistles</b> defeated the Montreal Wanderers in a two-game, total goals challenge series. The <b>Thistles</b> successfully defended the Cup once, against a team from Brandon, Manitoba. In March 1907, the Wanderers challenged the <b>Thistles</b> to a rematch. Despite an improved lineup, the <b>Thistles</b> lost the Cup to Montreal.|$|R
50|$|In 1975, the Muskies were renamed to the {{traditional}} Kenora namesake, the <b>Thistles.</b> The original Kenora <b>Thistles</b> were 1906 Stanley Cup champions.|$|R
5|$|Rail traffic through <b>Thistle</b> {{continued}} to increase as the Rio Grande cooperated with connecting railroads, making the rail line through <b>Thistle</b> a bridge line for transcontinental rail traffic. The growth of <b>Thistle</b> was {{closely tied to the}} success of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad throughout the era of steam locomotives.|$|E
5|$|Rhinocyllus conicus, a seed-feeding weevil, was {{introduced}} to North America to control exotic musk <b>thistle</b> (Carduus nutans) and Canadian <b>thistle</b> (Cirsium arvense). However the weevil also attacks native thistles, harming such species as the endemic Platte <b>thistle</b> (Cirsium neomexicanum) by selecting larger plants (which reduced the gene pool), reducing seed production and ultimately threatening the species' survival.|$|E
5|$|As royal badges James used: the Tudor rose, the <b>thistle</b> (for Scotland; {{first used}} by James III of Scotland), the Tudor rose dimidiated with the <b>thistle</b> ensigned with the royal crown, a harp (for Ireland) and a fleur de lys (for France).|$|E
50|$|From March 11 to 14, 2010, the <b>Thistles</b> {{hosted the}} HNO Gary Cook Cup senior hockey championship. The <b>Thistles</b> tied their first {{game against the}} Fort Frances Thunderhawks 3-3, a result that would later be {{overturned}} and awarded to the <b>Thistles.</b> Their second game was a 5-1 drubbing of their rival Thunder Bay K&A Twins. Due to the same protest that changed the result of their game against the Thunderhawks, the <b>Thistles</b> met the Twins again in the tournament final. The <b>Thistles</b> were victorious, taking the Twins 3-1. The will {{move on to the}} Renwick Cup in April against the winners of Major League Hockey.|$|R
50|$|Early in his career, Whitcroft made a {{name for}} himself in hockey circles with his {{outstanding}} amateur play with the Peterborough Colts. In 1907 the Stanley Cup champion Kenora <b>Thistles</b> signed him to a $700 contract. While with the <b>Thistles,</b> the team defeated Brandon to retain the Stanley Cup. The club next played a challenge with the Montreal Wanderers. The Wanderers defeated the <b>Thistles</b> in a two game, total points series by the score of 12-8, avenging their loss to the <b>Thistles</b> earlier in the season.|$|R
50|$|In 1930, the <b>Thistles</b> were {{accepted}} into the South Division of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League which would cut back on their travel as all the teams in the South Division were from Winnipeg, Manitoba. After winning the division in just their third season, the <b>Thistles</b> were forcefully moved to the more distant North Division. Despite the travel, the <b>Thistles</b> took their first league title in 1934. The <b>Thistles</b> would end up losing the Abbott Cup semi-final to the Port Arthur West Ends 9-goals-to-8 in two games.|$|R
5|$|Before {{moving to}} the Maryhill area in 1909, Partick <b>Thistle</b> hosted their home games over {{numerous}} sites in and around Glasgow including Kelvingrove Park, Jordanvale Park and Muir Park. In 1891, the club moved to Meadowside, near the River Clyde. However, in 1908 <b>Thistle</b> were forced to vacate the area {{to make way for}} a new shipyard.|$|E
5|$|Bull <b>thistle</b> (Cirsium vulgare), {{common mullein}} (Verbascum thapsus), and Klamath weed (Hypericum perforatum) have been {{identified}} as noxious pests in Yosemite since the 1940s. Additional species that have been recognized more recently as aggressive and requiring control are yellow star <b>thistle</b> (Centaurea solstitialis), sweet clover (Melilot spp.), Himalayan blackberry (Rubus armeniacus), cut-leaved blackberry (Rubus laciniatus) and large periwinkle (Vinca major).|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the Denver & Rio Grande Western {{began to}} phase out steam {{locomotives}} in favor of diesel locomotives, which require less maintenance. With the change in technology, <b>Thistle</b> faded in importance. Gradually the town shrank in population; the passenger depot was torn down in 1972 and the post office closed in 1974. By 1983, only a few families remained in <b>Thistle.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the 1952-53 season, the <b>Thistles</b> {{won their}} first ever Thunder Bay {{district}} championship {{and moved on}} to the Western Canadian championships. In the semi-final, the <b>Thistles</b> met the Manitoba champion Dauphin Kings who they defeated 3-games-to-none with 4-2, 7-3, and 5-4 victories. In the Edmonton Journal Trophy finals, the <b>Thistles</b> met the Alberta champion Ponoka Stampeders. Kenora won game on 7-4, but were blown out 8-1 in game two. The <b>Thistles</b> rebounded and took game three 5-3 and game four 8-4 before Ponoka could respond with a 3-2 win in game five to make the series 3-games-to-2 for Kenora. Game six was another do-or-die game for the Stampeders, but the <b>Thistles</b> were victorious winning the game 5-1 to take the series.|$|R
50|$|In March 1903, the Rat Portage <b>Thistles</b> would {{challenge}} the Ottawa Senators in a best-of-three series in Ottawa. The <b>Thistles</b> were younger and quicker than Ottawa; only one {{player on the}} <b>Thistles</b> was {{over the age of}} 20. However, poor soft ice conditions in Ottawa played a major factor as Ottawa swept the series with scores of 6-2 and 4-2.|$|R
50|$|In March 1905, the Rat Portage <b>Thistles</b> issued another {{challenge}} to the Senators. McGee did not play {{in the first game}} and the <b>Thistles</b> crushed Ottawa, 9-3. However, he returned to lead the Senators to 4-2 and 5-4 victories in games two and three, respectively. McGee returned in game two, with his good forearm wrapped in a cast, and only a light bandage on his broken wrist, to decoy the <b>Thistles.</b> Alf Smith scored three goals in game two on slow ice, which the <b>Thistles</b> claimed was salted to slow down the <b>Thistles.</b> There was hard ice in game three, and the lead exchanged hands several times. The <b>Thistles</b> led 2-1 at halftime and 3-2 midway through the second half. Ottawa took a 4-3 lead, before Tommy Phillips scored his third of the game to tie the score. However, McGee came through with the winning score late in the game to win it for Ottawa.|$|R
5|$|McNamara and {{assistant}} Simon Donnelly guided <b>Thistle</b> to a sixth-place finish in 2011–12 season. The following season <b>Thistle</b> started well and emerged as promotion candidates, competing with Dunfermline and Greenock Morton {{for a place}} in the following season's top flight. On 29 January 2013 the club gave permission to Dundee United to speak to McNamara about becoming their new manager. The following day McNamara and his assistant Simon Donnelly resigned, to become the new management team at United. Along with Donnelly, McNamara brought goalkeeper Craig Hinchcliffe, Paul Paton and Chris Erskine to Tannadice. <b>Thistle</b> were second in the league at the time and, because McNamara was under contract, compensation was owed to the club.|$|E
5|$|The {{railroad}} built several {{facilities in}} <b>Thistle</b> to service and prepare trains {{for the change}} in grade and curvature of the line. The railroad placed helper engines on eastbound trains at <b>Thistle</b> for the ascent to Soldier Summit. The town provided a meal service for the trains until the use of on-board dining cars eliminated the need for meal stops.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was over}} 30 years before <b>Thistle</b> {{achieved}} further cup success they not only maintained their top tier status during this period but {{finished third in the}} league in 1947–48, 1953–54 and 1962–63.|$|E

5|$|At Gunnison, US-89 turns east before curving {{northeast}} {{into the}} Sanpete Valley, {{formed by the}} San Pitch River, {{a tributary of the}} Sevier River. Along US-89 in this valley are several small cities: Manti, Ephraim, Mount Pleasant, and Fairview. Between Ephraim and Mount Pleasant, US-89 meets the south end of SR-132 at Pigeon Hollow Junction. SR-132 was formerly US-189, connecting US-89 with US-91 in Nephi. Beyond Fairview, where the scenic SR-31 turns east, US-89 climbs out of the valley, reaching a summit at Hill Top (elevation 6400 feet/2000 m). <b>Thistle</b> Creek parallels the next leg of the highway, descending through a canyon to the junction with US-6 near the ghost town of <b>Thistle,</b> flooded by a landslide in 1983. <b>Thistle</b> Creek and Soldier Creek, paralleled by US-89 and US-6, merge near this junction to form Spanish Fork, which the overlapped routes follow northwest through Spanish Fork Canyon into the Utah Valley at Moark Junction. US-89 splits to the north from US-6 there, skirts the west edge of Mapleton, and merges with SR-51 - the old Arrowhead Trail (US-91) - south of downtown Springville.|$|E
5|$|Current park {{managers}} {{focus on}} controlling nine high-priority invasive plant species of noxious weeds: yellow star-thistle (Centaurea solstitialis); spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa); Himalayan blackberry (Rubus armeniacus); bull <b>thistle</b> (Cirsium vulgare); velvet grass (Holcus lanatus); cheat grass (Bromus tectorum); French broom (Genista monspessulana); Italian <b>thistle</b> (Carduus pycnocephalus); and perennial pepperweed (Lepidium latifolium). In 2008, the park {{began to use}} the herbicides glyphosate and aminopyralid to augment manual methods to manage the most threatening plants.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{starting}} well {{upon returning}} to the First Division, Dick Campbell was sacked on 27 March 2007, following a succession of poor results. A caretaker management team of Jimmy Bone and Terry Butcher saw out the season before Ian McCall, a former player, was unveiled as manager. McCall's first season saw <b>Thistle</b> finish 6th in the First Division and embark on a successful Scottish Cup campaign, reaching the quarter-finals before being defeated by eventual winners Rangers after a 1–1 draw at Ibrox, <b>Thistle</b> lost the replay 2–0 at Firhill. League form further improved in season 2008–09 with <b>Thistle</b> exceeding expectations to finish 2nd in the First Division, behind St Johnstone. This season saw midfielder Gary Harkins win the Irn Bru Phenomenal Player of the Year and Jonathan Tuffey become the club's first full international for several years.|$|E
50|$|Swamp <b>thistles</b> {{can be used}} to make {{decorative}} arrangements. They {{are often}} planted in gardens because they are seen as more manageable than other <b>thistles,</b> while still potentially having some anti-herbivory properties.|$|R
50|$|In 1958, the Kenora <b>Thistles</b> {{joined the}} Ontario-Minnesota Hockey League. In the Thunder Bay {{district}} final, they faced {{the town of}} Red Rock in a best-of-5 series. The <b>Thistles</b> won 3-games-to-2. In the Western Canadian semi-final, the <b>Thistles</b> played Saskatchewan's Yorkton Millers in a best-of-3 series. Game one was a 4-4 tie, game two was won by Yorkton 4-2, and game three was won by Kenora 4-0. All tied up, the Millers and <b>Thistles</b> tied again in game four 1-1, but game five was won by Kenora 2-0 to win the series 2-games-to-1 with 2 ties. Then the <b>Thistles</b> made their last ever appearance in the Edmonton Journal Trophy finals against Alberta's Olds Elks. Kenora took game one 4-2, but Olds swept the next four games 6-3, 5-3, 4-1, and 7-6 to win the Western Canadian crown.|$|R
50|$|The 2008-09 {{season was}} spent {{with a short}} {{exhibition}} schedule against other Senior teams in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. These games included a pair against Theoren Fleury's Steinbach North Stars, hosts of the 2009 Allan Cup. The playoffs began for the <b>Thistles</b> on March 13 against the Thunder Bay Twins. Two victories would take the <b>Thistles</b> directly to the 2009 Allan Cup round robin {{for the first time}} ever. Playing in Thunder Bay, the <b>Thistles</b> struck first with a 5-4 double-overtime victory. The next evening the Twins struck back, taking Game 2 by a 7-2 score. The <b>Thistles</b> dominated early and took a 3-2 lead into the third period. Late in the game the Twins tied the score at 3 and forced overtime. In the second overtime period, the Twins scored to win 4-3 and ended the <b>Thistles</b> third season of play.|$|R
5|$|During the 2013/14 season, the Main Stand was re-opened to seat {{the high}} number of away {{supporters}}. In one instance, the North Stand was used for Celtic supporters as fears grew over fire dangers. During early June 2016 the Main Stand was renamed The Colin Weir Stand in honour of Colin Weir who was made the first ever patron of Partick <b>Thistle</b> after making numerous donations to the club's youth team The <b>Thistle</b> Weir Academy.|$|E

5|$|Following Lambie's {{retirement}} {{at the end}} of the 2002–03 season, <b>Thistle</b> struggled. Gerry Collins (Lambie's previous assistant) {{was sacked}} mid-season and replaced with joint player-managers Derek Whyte and Gerry Britton. This change was not enough to revive the team, and <b>Thistle</b> were relegated {{at the end of}} the 2003–04 season after Inverness, having won the First Division title, were permitted to groundshare with Aberdeen. In season 2004–05 the team continued to struggle and Whyte and Britton were dismissed mid-season. Dick Campbell, their successor, was unable to avoid relegation to the Second Division. He did return the club to the First Division the following season, through the newly introduced play-off system, having finished 4th in the league. This brought to a close the club's most unpredictable decade, in footballing terms at least: between 1996 and 2006 <b>Thistle</b> had been promoted three times and relegated four times. They were the first team in Scottish football to be relegated from the top flight through successive subsequent relegations (excluding those caused by league reconstruction).|$|E
