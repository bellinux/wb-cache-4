5|$|Similar to humans, gray wolves have facial color {{patterns}} {{in which the}} gaze direction can be easily identified, although this is often {{not the case in}} other canid species. In 2014, a study compared the facial color pattern across 25 canid species. The results suggested that the facial color pattern of canid species is related to <b>their</b> <b>gaze</b> communication, and that especially gray wolves use the gaze signal in conspecific communication.|$|E
5|$|Joint {{attention}} or shared attention is the shared focus of two individuals on an object. It is achieved when one individual alerts another to an object {{by means of}} eye-gazing, pointing or other verbal or non-verbal indications. An individual gazes at another individual, points to an object and then returns <b>their</b> <b>gaze</b> to the individual. Scaife and Bruner were the first researchers to present a cross-sectional description of children's ability to follow eye gaze in 1975. They found that most eight- to ten-month-old children followed a line of regard, and that all 11- to 14-month-old children did so. This early research showed {{it was possible for}} an adult to bring certain objects in the environment to an infant's attention using eye gaze.|$|E

50|$|He {{directed}} A Silent Summer (Un été silencieux, 52 min, 2005), a {{film that}} takes place on the summer pastures of Kyrgyzstan, in the Tian Shan Mountains, not far from China. Through the attention it pays to ordinary moments, the film describes the solitude and arguments of shepherds {{living in the same}} tent, {{as well as that of}} the filmmaker, present but unnoticed, remote from <b>their</b> <b>gazes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Traditions on {{both sides}} of the Atlantic tell of the spirit abducting her {{followers}} or random people whilst they are swimming or boating. She brings them to her paradisiacal realm, which may be underwater, in the spirit world, or both. Should she allow them to leave, the travellers usually return in dry clothing and with a new spiritual understanding reflected in <b>their</b> <b>gaze.</b> These returnees often grow wealthier, more attractive, and more easygoing after the encounter.|$|E
25|$|After {{his return}} in 1953, Twombly {{served in the}} U.S. army as a cryptologist, an {{activity}} that left a distinct mark on his artistic style. From 1955 to 1959, he worked in New York, where he became a prominent figure {{among a group of}} artists including Robert Rauschenberg, with whom he was sharing a studio, and Jasper Johns. Exposure to the emerging New York School purged figurative aspects from his work, encouraging a simplified form of abstraction. He became fascinated with tribal art, using the painterly language of the early 1950s to invoke primitivism, reversing the normal evolution of the New York School. Twombly soon developed a technique of gestural drawing that was characterized by thin white lines on a dark canvas that appear to be scratched onto the surface. His early sculptures, assembled from discarded objects, similarly cast <b>their</b> <b>gaze</b> back to Europe and North Africa. He stopped making sculptures in 1959 and did not take up sculpting again until 1976.|$|E
500|$|As in {{the first}} game, the player has access to supernatural powers. These powers are {{optional}} and may be rejected. Independently that supernatural powers are rejected or not, the player receives a heart item which aids in the discovery of bonecharms and runes; these provide passive perks and skill points, respectively; if the powers are not accepted, runes are converted into additional coins. The heart also reveals whether those the player comes across are sympathetic, guilty or murderous. Unlike the first game, the upgrading system was changed to a skill tree with multiple paths and more possible upgrades; a power may have a lethal or non-lethal upgrade. Each character has unique powers. [...] "Dark Vision", the power that more easily identifies the player's surroundings, including where an enemy directs <b>their</b> <b>gaze,</b> is available to both. Another skill tree, applied to both playable characters, unlock more passive abilities which do not consume mana, {{such as the ability}} to run faster and jump higher, or the ability to craft bonecharms.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{others argue}} that the female gaze is also present in the play, with Salome gazing and {{objectifying}} Iokannan. As critic Carmen Skaggs writes, [...] "Syrian, Herod, and Salomé objectify the subjects of <b>their</b> <b>gazes.</b> They admire each one for his/her beauty alone. The desires of all three are forbidden and recognized as dangerous by those around them, {{but they are not}} persuaded to turn away".|$|R

Ranging widely, the authors will delight, provoke, and very possibly inspire readers {{who want to know}} how nations can Move UP.”—Robert Kurzban.|$|R

500|$|Slant Magazines Matthew Cole {{was less}} impressed, believing West had contributed a [...] "powerhouse production" [...] {{but that the}} album [...] "requires you to {{tolerate}} the artists' self-mythologizing and put up with their sometimes awkward attempts at experimentation."

[...] In the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot found the record plagued by Jay-Z and West's [...] "self-regard", writing that [...] "they urge listeners to 'watch the throne,' and gaze in awe on their good fortune." [...] Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone felt that [...] "on a record this ambitious, this sonically bold, it's a shame two of music's greatest storytellers don't extend <b>their</b> <b>gaze</b> beyond their own luxe lives." [...] Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker stated, [...] "Weed the album down to a healthy ten, and [...] doesn't become either classic or coherent, but it does work as an entertaining document of two wildly creative, not particularly wound-up friends." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cattle hearing {{ranges from}} 23 Hz to 35kHz. [...] Their {{frequency}} of best sensitivity is 8kHz {{and they have}} a lowest threshold of −21 db (re 20 μN/m−2), which means their hearing is more acute than horses (lowest threshold of 7 db). Sound localization acuity thresholds are an average of 30°. [...] This means that cattle are less able to localise sounds compared to goats (18°), dogs (8°) and humans (0.8°). [...] Because cattle have a broad foveal fields of view covering almost the entire horizon, they may not need very accurate locus information from their auditory systems to direct <b>their</b> <b>gaze</b> to a sound source.|$|E
2500|$|This is the practice, {{especially}} by high-end art auctioneers, of raising false bids at crucial {{times in the}} bidding {{in order to create}} the appearance of greater demand or to extend bidding momentum for a work on offer. To call out these nonexistent bids auctioneers might fix <b>their</b> <b>gaze</b> at a point in the auction room that is difficult for the audience to pin down. The practice is frowned upon in the industry. In the United States, chandelier bidding is not illegal. In fact, an auctioneer may bid up the price of an item to the reserve price, which is an unstated amount the consignor will not sell the item for. [...] However, the auction house is required to disclose this information.|$|E

Astronomer Eugene Merle Shoemaker (BS 1947, MS 1948) co-discovered Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 (a comet which crashed into the planet Jupiter) and was the first person buried on the moon (by having his ashes crashed into the moon). [...] Astronomer George O. Abell (BS 1951, MS 1952, PhD 1957) while a grad student at Cal Tech participated in the National Geographic Society-Palomar Sky Survey.

2500|$|Among his {{earliest}} interior work for DC was {{a chapter in}} Justice League of America No. 200 (March 1982) alongside artistic heroes Joe Kubert, Carmine Infantino and Gil Kane, as well as Jim Aparo, George Pérez and Dick Giordano.

[...] Bolland felt that [...] "after my cover [...] worked out the people at DC turned <b>their</b> <b>gaze</b> on London... and particularly on the group of artists at 2000AD who had been weaned on the DC characters."

2500|$|On Earth, {{our bodies}} react {{automatically}} to gravity, maintaining both posture and locomotion in a downward pulling world. In microgravity environments, these constant signals are absent: the otolith organs {{in the inner}} ear are sensitive to linear acceleration and no longer perceive a downwards bias; muscles are no longer required to contract to maintain posture, and pressure receptors in the feet and ankles no longer signal the direction of [...] "down". These changes can immediately result in visual-orientation illusions where the astronaut feels he has flipped 180 degrees. [...] Over half of astronauts also experience symptoms of motion sickness {{for the first three}} days of travel due to the conflict between what the body expects and what the body actually perceives. Over time however the brain adapts and although these illusions can still occur, most astronauts begin to see [...] "down" [...] as where the feet are. People returning to Earth after extended weightless periods have to readjust to the force of gravity and may have problems standing up, focusing <b>their</b> <b>gaze,</b> walking and turning. This is just an initial problem, as they recover these abilities quickly.|$|E
50|$|Demogorgon can charm enemies {{or drive}} enemies insane with his gaze, {{depending}} on which head's eyes are met; if both heads lock <b>their</b> <b>gazes</b> on a single target simultaneously, Demogorgon can hypnotize foes. His whip-like tail {{has the ability to}} drain the life energy right out of a living foe. His tentacles cause living creatures to rot away, as if by some sort of rapid leprosy. Because each head is a separate personality that each controls his body, Demogorgon may act twice as often during combat as he should be able to.|$|R

2500|$|Carvings of St John's {{head on a}} dish {{were popular}} from the 13th to 16th centuries and were made of various materials, some quite expensive. The Duke of Berry owned one made from gold. The head on the dish assumed eucharistic connotations, and is {{mentioned}} in the York breviary; [...] "St John's head on the dish signifies the body of Christ which feeds us on the holy altar". The head became associated with the host and Salome's charger with the paten – iconography that appeared in Early Netherlandish art from about 1450. The heads in these paintings resembled carvings, as in van der Weyden's Altar of Saint John. Van der Weyden's depiction of St John's beheading includes the next sequence in the event: Salome delivering the head to the banquet table where her mother, Herodias, stabs it. Furthermore, van der Weyden follows the prevailing iconography with Salome and the executioner, who were pagan and thus not permitted {{to look at the}} head (or that which it symbolized), twisting away and averting <b>their</b> <b>gaze.</b> In Memling's version, the executioner looks directly at the head as he places it on the charger and Salome only partially averts her eyes. Barbara Lane speculates that although Memling patterned the scene after van der Weyden's, he [...] "misunderstood the symbolism".|$|E

Through mutual fear they tacitly let the slush-lamp burn all night, and saw to a plentiful supply of bacon-grease before retiring.
