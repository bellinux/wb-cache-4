5|$|Teaching {{members of}} <b>the</b> <b>colleges</b> (i.e. fellows and tutors) are collectively and familiarly known as dons, {{although}} {{the term is}} rarely used by the university itself. In addition to residential and dining facilities, <b>the</b> <b>colleges</b> provide social, cultural, and recreational activities for their members. Colleges have responsibility for admitting undergraduates and organising their tuition; for graduates, this responsibility falls upon the departments. There is no common title for the heads of colleges: the titles used include Warden, Provost, Principal, President, Rector, Master and Dean.|$|E

5|$|All of <b>the</b> <b>colleges,</b> {{except for}} Kresge, have both {{residence}} halls and apartments. Kresge is all apartments. Apartments are typically shared by {{four to eight}} students, have common living/dining rooms, kitchens and bathrooms, and a combination of shared and private bedrooms. Apartments at colleges other than Kresge are generally reserved for students above the freshman level.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with the constituent colleges, <b>the</b> <b>colleges</b> of Knox, Massey, Regis, St. Michael's, Trinity, Victoria and Wycliffe continue to exist as legally distinct entities, each possessing a separate financial endowment. While St. Michael's, Trinity and Victoria continue to recognize their religious affiliations and heritage, they have since adopted secular policies of enrolment and teaching in non-divinity subjects. Some colleges have, or once had, collegiate structures of their own: Emmanuel College is a college of Victoria and St. Hilda's College is part of Trinity; St. Joseph’s College had existed as a college within St. Michael's until it was dissolved in 2006. Ewart College existed as an affiliated college until 1991, when it was merged into Knox College. Postgraduate theology degrees are conferred by <b>the</b> <b>colleges</b> of Knox, Regis and Wycliffe, along with the divinity faculties within Emmanuel, St. Michael's and Trinity, including joint degrees with the university through the Toronto School of Theology.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} {{is made up}} of a variety of institutions, including 38 constituent colleges and a full range of academic departments which are organised into four divisions. All <b>the</b> <b>colleges</b> are self-governing institutions within the university, each controlling its own membership and with its own internal structure and activities. Being a city university, it does not have a main campus and instead its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. Most undergraduate teaching at Oxford is organised around weekly tutorials at <b>the</b> <b>colleges</b> and halls, supported by classes, lectures and laboratory work provided by university faculties and departments.|$|E
25|$|The University {{has seven}} degree-granting colleges: <b>the</b> <b>College</b> of Arts and Sciences, <b>the</b> <b>College</b> of Aviation, <b>the</b> Haworth <b>College</b> of Business, <b>the</b> <b>College</b> of Education, <b>the</b> <b>College</b> of Engineering and Applied Sciences, <b>the</b> <b>College</b> of Fine Arts and <b>the</b> <b>College</b> of Health and Human Services.

5|$|Debates among monks on the Buddhist doctrines are {{integral}} to the learning process in <b>the</b> <b>colleges</b> in the Sera Monastery complex. This facilitates better comprehension of the Buddhist philosophy to attain higher levels of study. This exemplary debating tradition supplemented with gestures {{is said to be}} exclusive to this monastery, among the several other monasteries of Lhasa. Visitors also attend to witness these debates that are held as per a set schedule, every day in the 'Debating Courtyard' of the monastery.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech's {{undergraduate}} and graduate programs are divided into six colleges. Collaboration among <b>the</b> <b>colleges</b> is frequent, as mandated {{by a number of}} interdisciplinary degree programs and research centers. Georgia Tech has sought to strengthen its {{undergraduate and}} graduate offerings in less technical fields, primarily those under the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts. That particular College has seen a 20% increase in admissions. Also, even in the Ivan Allen College, the Institute does not offer a Bachelor of Arts degree, only a Bachelor of Science.|$|E
50|$|It is {{composed}} of <b>the</b> <b>College</b> of Accountancy and Finance, <b>the</b> <b>College</b> of Public Administration, <b>the</b> <b>College</b> of Computer and Information Sciences, <b>the</b> <b>College</b> of Education, and <b>the</b> <b>College</b> of Tourism and Hotel and Restaurant Management.|$|R

Most of Newark's academic institutions are in the city's University Heights district. <b>The</b> <b>colleges</b> and universities have worked together to help revitalize the area, which serves more than 60,000 students and faculty.|$|E
5|$|The Sera {{complex is}} divided into two sectors by pathways; the eastern part {{contains}} the Great Assembly Hall and the dwellings and the western part has the well-known three colleges: the Sera Je Dratsang, the Sera Me Dratsang; and the Ngakpa Dratsang, all instituted by Tsongkhapa as monastic universities that catered to monks in the age range 8-70. All the structures within this complex formed a clockwise pilgrimage circuit, starting with <b>the</b> <b>colleges</b> (in the order stated), followed by the hall, the dwelling units and finally ending at the hermitage of Tsongkhapa above the Great Assembly Hall.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of <b>the</b> <b>colleges</b> and {{universities}} who have had a player win a Heisman trophy: Ohio State and Notre Dame are tied for the most trophies at 7 each (USC's 2005 award having been voluntarily forfeited). Ohio State has the distinction of the only two-time winner, Archie Griffin, leaving their total players to have won the trophy at six. In total, players from 39 different schools have won a Heisman Trophy, while 18 schools have more than one trophy.|$|E
50|$|Between 1958 and 1960 <b>the</b> <b>College</b> of Sciences, <b>the</b> <b>College</b> of Business (now <b>the</b> <b>College</b> of Public Administration) and <b>the</b> <b>College</b> of Pharmacy were established.|$|R

5|$|This {{is a list}} of <b>the</b> <b>colleges</b> {{within the}} University of Cambridge. These colleges provide most of the {{accommodation}} for undergraduates and graduates at the University and at the undergraduate level they have responsibility for admitting students to the University and organising their tuition. They also provide funding, accommodation, or both, for some of the senior research posts in the University. They are self-governed charities in their own right, with their own endowments and possessions. Until the mid-19th century, both Cambridge and Oxford comprised a group of colleges with a small central university administration, rather than universities in the common sense.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most North American institutions, the University of Toronto is a collegiate {{university}} with a {{model that}} resembles those of the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford in Britain. <b>The</b> <b>colleges</b> hold substantial autonomy over admissions, scholarships, programs and other academic and financial affairs, {{in addition to the}} housing and social duties of typical residential colleges. The system emerged in the 19th century, as ecclesiastical colleges considered various forms of union with the University of Toronto to ensure their viability. The desire to preserve religious traditions in a secular institution resulted in the federative collegiate model that came to characterize the university.|$|E
5|$|While the {{university}} has a larger annual income and operating budget, <b>the</b> <b>colleges</b> have a larger aggregate endowment: over £3.8bn compared to {{the university}}'s £834m. The Central University's endowment, {{along with some of}} the colleges', is managed by the university's wholly owned endowment management office, Oxford University Endowment Management, formed in 2007. The university has substantial investments in fossil fuel companies, and in 2014 began consultations on whether it should follow some US universities which have committed to sell off their fossil fuel investments.|$|E

5|$|World War II had a {{dramatic}} impact on Texas, as federal money poured in to build military bases, munitions factories, POW detention camps and Army hospitals; 750,000 young men left for service; the cities exploded with new industry; <b>the</b> <b>colleges</b> took on new roles; {{and hundreds of}} thousands of poor farmers left the fields for much better paying war jobs, never to return to agriculture. Texas manufactured 3.1 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking eleventh among the 48 states.|$|E
5|$|Aarhus Tech {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{technical}} colleges in Denmark, teaching undergraduate study programmes in English, including vocational education and training (VET), continuing vocational training (CVT), and human resource development.
