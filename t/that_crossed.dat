5|$|A {{tropical}} wave <b>that</b> <b>crossed</b> Central America {{organized and}} {{developed into a}} tropical depression on June 27. Contrary to forecasts, the depression did not strengthen further because of strong wind shear. By June 29, the depression had become a remnant low, which was observed as a swirl of clouds {{for a few more}} days before dissipating.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that four lanes at the western end was not enough. Several safety improvement areas were identified and projects implemented. In 1988 the Basalt Bypass relocated the highway off its original alignment through that town (currently Two Rivers Road), to a new two-lane road to the south of it <b>that</b> <b>crossed</b> the Roaring Fork to the east of the town.|$|E
5|$|Takalik Abaj {{was one of}} {{a series}} of early sites on or near the Pacific coastal plain that were {{important}} commercial, ceremonial and political centres. It is apparent that it prospered from the production of cacao and from the trade routes <b>that</b> <b>crossed</b> the region. At the time of the Spanish Conquest in the 16th century the area was still important for its cacao production.|$|E

5|$|The Russian army <b>that</b> <b>crossed</b> the Lithuanian {{border in}} early October 1632 had been {{carefully}} prepared and {{was under the}} experienced command of Mikhail Borisovich Shein, who had previously defended Smolensk against the Poles during the 1609–1611 siege. Several towns and castles fell as the Russians advanced, and on 28 October 1632 (the same day that the historic town of Dorogobuzh was taken), Shein moved to begin the siege of Smolensk.|$|E
5|$|The first cyclist {{to cross}} the finish line {{received}} 1 point. Other cyclists received one point more than the cyclist who passed the line directly before him, plus an additional point for every five minutes between them, with a maximum of ten points. In this way, a cyclist could not get more than 11 points more than the cyclist <b>that</b> <b>crossed</b> the finish line just before him.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the highway system in Michigan {{dates back to the}} old Native American trails <b>that</b> <b>crossed</b> the state. These trails were {{pathways}} no wider than approximately , permitting single-file traffic. Many of the modern highways in the state follow the path of these old trails, including the Great Trail from Fort Pitt to Fort Detroit which is now US24 from Detroit to Toledo, Ohio. This trail connected with Braddock's Road which led to the Atlantic Coast.|$|E

Connor says he doesn't care what happens, he just wants Nikita back. Connor tells Roland about a hacienda <b>that</b> <b>Cross</b> has. Roland {{promises}} that he'll get Nikita back from Cross.|$|R
5|$|With {{the rise}} of light cavalry, the stamina and agility of horses with Arabian blood gave an {{enormous}} military advantage to any army who possessed them. As a result, many European monarchs began to support large breeding establishments <b>that</b> <b>crossed</b> Arabians on local stock, one example being Knyszyna, the royal stud of Polish king Zygmunt II August, and another the Imperial Russian Stud of Peter the Great.|$|E
5|$|A year later, Pedro de Alvarado entered Chiapas when {{he crossed}} {{a part of}} the Lacandon Forest in an attempt to link up with an {{expedition}} headed by Hernán Cortés, <b>that</b> <b>crossed</b> from the Gulf of Mexico to Honduras. Alvarado entered Chiapas from Guatemala via the territory of the Acala Ch'ol; he was unable to locate Cortés, and his scouts eventually led him to Tecpan Puyumatlan (modern Santa Eulalia in Guatemala), in a mountainous region near the territory of the Lakandon Ch'ol. The inhabitants of Tecpan Puyumatlan offered fierce resistance against the Spanish-led expedition, and Gonzalo de Alvarado wrote that the Spanish suffered many losses, including the killing of messengers sent to summon the natives to swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown. After failing to locate Cortés, the Alvarados returned to Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|All {{that is left}} of Missouri Row is a four-sided {{concrete}} fireplace {{surrounded by}} pieces of foundation, a few sets of stairs, metal plumbing, and a retaining wall. East of that, surrounding {{what is now the}} Monte Ne boat launch, are remnants of limestone structures. Some of these are foundations from the broad wooden staircase built in front of Hotel Monte Ne; some are structural components for the twin stone bridges <b>that</b> <b>crossed</b> the lagoon and some are simply low retaining walls. The amphitheater and the retaining wall built for the Pyramid are underwater. Occasionally, when water levels drop in summer, they can be seen.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Inigo {{was tied}} with Cyclone Gwenda for being the most intense {{recorded}} cyclone in the Australian region in terms of pressure. It developed from a tropical low <b>that</b> <b>crossed</b> eastern Indonesia in late March 2003. Becoming a named tropical cyclone on 1 April, Inigo rapidly intensified as it tracked southwestward, reaching a minimum central pressure of 900hPa on 4 April. An approaching trough weakened the cyclone and turned it to the southeast, and on 8 April Inigo dissipated after making landfall on Western Australia as a minimal tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{there being}} 20 named systems, five above the average, only four storms {{directly}} affected land. Hurricane Eugene {{was the first}} Pacific hurricane to make landfall in Mexico in July since the 1954 season and caused all of the season's three deaths and $142.12 million damage. Tropical Storm Pilar and Hurricane Norma also came close to land, with the former producing record rain in Baja California Sur. The remnants of Hurricanes Ramon and Norma caused rain in the Continental United States. Elsewhere, Peke was a central north Pacific hurricane <b>that</b> <b>crossed</b> the International Dateline and became a typhoon of the 1987 Pacific typhoon season.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Tico is one {{of three}} major hurricanes to strike Mazatlan. The origins of Hurricane Tico were from a weak {{tropical}} disturbance <b>that</b> <b>crossed</b> Costa Rica into the Pacific Ocean on October7, 1983. Over warm waters, the system was sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Twenty-One on October 11, about 575mi (930km) south of Acapulco. On October12 it turned sharply northward; the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Tico on October13. Tropical Storm Tico continued to intensify. Two days after becoming a tropical storm, Tico strengthened further to attain hurricane status. Early on October19, it reached peak winds of 130mph (215km/h). It weakened slightly as it approached the coast, and at about 1500UTC that day Tico made landfall near Mazatlán with winds of 125mph (205km/h). The remains were tracked into the Mid-Atlantic States for five more days.|$|E

5|$|In the south, Jordanian {{artillery}} shelling {{prevented the}} Israelis from erecting another pontoon bridge {{on the site}} of the Abdullah bridge, halting the Israeli advance there. After crossing the Allenby Bridge, the 7th Armored Brigade spread in three directions from Shuna: One or more companies drove north to Karameh. An infantry battalion and a tank battalion moved east to block the Salt road. And another infantry battalion moved south to assist the force trying to break across the Abdullah Bridge. Meanwhile, the force <b>that</b> <b>crossed</b> the Damia Bridge established itself on the east bank. Engineers began constructing a new bridge, and the force advanced east to the Musri junction. After taking Musri, their intended advance south to Karameh was repulsed by the northern brigade of the Jordanian 1st Division.|$|E
5|$|Late in that season, the Calgary Flames dealt all-star forward Theoren Fleury, {{along with}} Chris Dingman, to the Avalanche for Rene Corbet, Wade Belak, a draft pick and {{their choice of}} a {{prospect}} from a list provided by Colorado. Impressed with his defensive potential, the Flames later chose Regehr to complete that trade. His professional career nearly ended before it started, as he was seriously injured {{in an automobile accident}} near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on July 4, 1999. Regehr, who was driving home from a summer trip with his elder brother Dinho (Ronald) and two female friends, was struck head-on by another vehicle <b>that</b> <b>crossed</b> into his path. He suffered two broken legs in the crash that killed two people in the other vehicle. Doctors initially feared that he would never play hockey again.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of present-day}} MD 331 was {{designated}} {{as part of}} US 213 in 1926 when the U.S. Highway System was established. By 1940, US 213 was {{moved to a new}} alignment <b>that</b> <b>crossed</b> the Choptank River at Cambridge on a bridge built in 1935 and MD 331 was designated to run from Vienna to Easton. Both ends of MD 331 have been shortened since, with the southernmost portion of MD 331 curtailed following the completion of the US 50 bypass of Vienna by the 1990s and the northern terminus of the route cut back to US 50 in 2004 when the state-maintained portion of Dover Road to Dover Street in Easton was turned over to the city.|$|E

Note: the meridian <b>that</b> <b>crosses</b> Giza Great Pyramid (31°08'3.69"E) is 855 km shorter.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a {{setting in which}} two firms first choose equity positions in each others stock (cross holdings) and then compete in an imperfect product market. We demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>cross</b> holdings lead to higher firm profits and higher consumer surplus when the competitors’ products are complements. We find <b>that</b> <b>cross</b> holdings lead to lower firm profits and higher consumer surplus when the products are substitutes. This finding {{is in contrast to}} the existing literature which establishes <b>that</b> <b>cross</b> holdings leads to higher firm profits and to lower consumer surplus. The contrasting results emerge because we solve for optimal cross holdings, whereas the existing literature considers exogenous cross holdings. In addition, allowing optimal cross holdings improves economic welfare. Furthermore, we demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>cross</b> holdings deter entry when the products are substitutes and facilitate entry when the products are complements. ...|$|R

5|$|On April 1, 1970, Judge George Luzerne Hart, Jr., of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, {{ordered the}} Interior Department to not issue a {{construction}} permit for {{a section of}} the project <b>that</b> <b>crossed</b> one of the claims. Less than two weeks later, Hart heard arguments from conservation groups that the TAPS project violated the Mineral Leasing Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, which had gone into effect {{at the start of the}} year. Hart issued an injunction against the project, preventing the Interior Department from issuing a construction permit and halting the project in its tracks.|$|E
5|$|Petén {{was first}} {{penetrated}} by Hernán Cortés with a sizeable expedition <b>that</b> <b>crossed</b> the territory {{from north to}} south in 1525. In {{the first half of the}} 16th century, Spain established neighbouring colonies in Yucatán to the north and Guatemala to the south. Spanish missionaries laid the groundwork for the extension of colonial administration in the extreme south of Petén from 1596 onwards, but no further Spanish entry of central Petén took place until 1618 and 1619 when missionaries arrived at the Itza capital, having travelled from the Spanish town of Mérida in Yucatán.|$|E
5|$|The French did {{not fully}} comply with the {{commerce}} provisions of the Treaty of Utrecht. They attempted to prevent English trade with remote Indian tribes, and they erected Fort Niagara in Iroquois territory. French settlements continued to grow on the Gulf Coast, with the settlement of New Orleans in 1718 and other (unsuccessful) attempts to expand into Spanish-controlled Texas and Florida. French trading networks penetrated the continent along the waterways feeding the Gulf of Mexico, renewing conflicts with both the British and the Spanish. Trading networks established in the Mississippi River watershed, including the Ohio River valley, also brought the French into more contact with British trading networks and colonial settlements <b>that</b> <b>crossed</b> the Appalachian Mountains. Conflicting claims over that territory eventually led to war in 1754, when the French and Indian War broke out.|$|E
