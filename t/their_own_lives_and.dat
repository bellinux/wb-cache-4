5|$|Wright's sermon left a great {{impression}} on Obama, who recounted Wright's sermon {{in detail in}} his memoir Dreams from My Father. Soon after Dreams From My Father was published he went into politics, entering the Illinois Senate. In 2004 he was chosen to deliver the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. In Obama's 2006 memoir The Audacity of Hope, he recollects that on being chosen to deliver this speech, he pondered the topics on which he had previously campaigned, and on major issues then affecting the nation, before thinking about the variety of people he had met while campaigning, all endeavouring in different ways to improve <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> to serve their country.|$|E
5|$|Life {{expectancy}} in HD {{is generally}} around 20years following {{the onset of}} visible symptoms. Most life-threatening complications result from muscle coordination and, to a lesser extent, behavioral changes induced by declining cognitive function. The largest risk is pneumonia, which causes death in one third of those with HD. As the ability to synchronize movements deteriorates, difficulty clearing the lungs and {{an increased risk of}} aspirating food or drink both increase the risk of contracting pneumonia. The second greatest risk is heart disease, which causes almost a quarter of fatalities of those with HD. Suicide is the third greatest cause of fatalities, with 7.3% of those with HD taking <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> up to 27% attempting to do so. It is unclear to what extent suicidal thoughts are influenced by behavioral symptoms, as they signify sufferers' desires to avoid the later stages of the disease. Other associated risks include choking, physical injury from falls, and malnutrition.|$|E

When they do broach sensitive subjects with their children, they usually psychoanalyze them as well, a habit that has a very bad effect on Lilly. Michael, who is more perceptive, avoids their attention by keeping more to himself. Lilly has inherited her intelligence and hobby of analyzing people from them.|$|E

25|$|The {{remaining}} members pursued <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> careers {{outside of the}} band. Nicol, Pegg, and Mattacks had recorded and toured with Richard and Linda Thompson at times in the 1970s, and did so again during this period, culminating in their appearance on the Shoot Out the Lights album and tour in 1982. Bruce Rowlands gave up the music business and moved to Denmark {{and as a result}} Dave Mattacks returned as drummer for Fairport’s occasional gigs. Dave Pegg was the first of several Fairporters to join Jethro Tull which gave him well-paying steady employment. Simon Nicol had teamed up with Dave Swarbrick in a highly regarded acoustic duo, but this partnership was made difficult by Swarbrick’s sudden decision to move to Scotland, where, from 1984 he began to focus on his new project Whippersnapper.|$|E
500|$|About 3:30 p.m., {{all three}} left {{the scene and}} started to walk back towards the border. On {{their way to the}} border, they were {{challenged}} by the security forces. When challenged, they made movements which led the military personnel, operating in support of the Gibraltar Police, to conclude that <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> the lives of others were under threat. In light of this response, they [...] were shot. Those killed were subsequently found not to have been carrying arms.|$|E
500|$|Friends {{has also}} {{developed}} an alternative family lifestyle by representing {{young people that}} live unconventional domestic lives. It presents the idea that [...] "all you need is good friends" [...] and can construct families through choice. The audience is able {{to identify with the}} program through the troubles seen on weekly episodes. It portrays a new way of living life and developing relationships which are not normally seen in conventional society. According to a pop-culture expert at the University at Buffalo, Friends is [...] "one of those rare shows that marked a change in American culture." [...] The images of youth and the roles they portray are better defined and represent a lifestyle that centres around creating and sustaining relationships between friends running <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> seeking help from each other.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} day, however, Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British foreign secretary, made {{a statement}} to the House of Commons regarding the shootings, in which he informed the house that the IRA members were unarmed, and that the car parked in the assembly area did not contain an explosive device. Howe stated that the IRA members [...] "made movements which led the military personnel, operating in support of the Gibraltar Police, to conclude that <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> the lives of others were under threat". [...] "In light of this response", Howe continued, [...] "they were shot" [...] by [...] "military personnel, operating in support of the Gibraltar Police".

500|$|The episode's director, Mark Kirkland, said {{he enjoyed}} {{directing}} the episode because the characters' emotions throughout it are [...] "very human and real". He believed many viewers watching the episode would recognize the emotions from experiences in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives,</b> <b>and</b> would feel {{sympathy for the}} characters. The idea of Homer annoying {{the people at the}} movie theater was based on an experience Groening had with a friend of his when he was younger. They were sitting by themselves in a movie theater and two [...] "annoying" [...] women sat down right in front of them. Groening's friend told the women to move and they did. One of the women then turned to Groening and his friend and said, [...] "Now are you satisfied?", to which Groening's friend replied: [...] "I won't be satisfied until I see you burn in hell." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Mike Bullen's first script, {{an hour-long}} comedy {{entitled}} The Perfect Match, {{was produced by}} Granada Television in 1995. Granada's controller of comedy Andy Harries {{was pleased with the}} balance Bullen's script struck between comedy and drama. Eager to develop a television series for middle-class thirty-somethings, Harries had Bullen pitch ideas to The Perfect Match assistant producer Christine Langan, with a view to making a pilot. Bullen's initial idea was a typical [...] "boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy wins girl back" [...] story, but told {{from both sides of the}} relationship. Langan accepted Bullen's pitch and he began writing a first draft. Bullen and Langan were influenced by the American television series Thirtysomething and the film When Harry Met Sally; the stories were funny and dramatic but neither aspect was [...] "ghettoised". Believing that there was little television aimed at people like them, Bullen and Langan discussed <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> friends, using personal experiences to create the characters: Adam was based on Bullen before he met his wife and Rachel was based on a combination of his ex-girlfriends and [...] "the fantasy girlfriend". When writing his first draft, Bullen realised that telling the same story from both sides of the relationship would mean repeating something that the audience had already seen. To rectify this he introduced the fantasy scenes and the idea of the characters reporting events in a slightly different way to what really happened.|$|E

500|$|On February 23, 303, Diocletian {{ordered that}} the newly built Christian church at Nicomedia be razed, its scriptures burned, and its treasures seized. February 23 was {{the feast of}} the Terminalia, for Terminus, the god of boundaries. It was the day they would {{terminate}} Christianity. The next day, Diocletian's first [...] "Edict against the Christians" [...] was published. The key targets of this piece of legislation were, as they had been during Valerian's persecution, Christian property and senior clerics. The edict prohibited Christians from assembling for worship, and ordered the destruction of their scriptures, liturgical books, and places of worship across the empire. But Christians tried to retain the scriptures as far as possible, though, according to de Ste Croix, [...] "it appears that giving them up...was not regarded as a sin" [...] in the East; sufficient numbers of them must have been successfully saved, as is evident from the representative findings of [...] "early biblical papyri" [...] in the stream of the transmission of the text during this period. Christians might have given up apocryphal or pseudepigraphal works, or even refused to surrender their scriptures at the cost of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives,</b> <b>and</b> there were some cases where the scriptures were not in the end destroyed. Christians were also deprived of the right to petition the courts, making them potential subjects for judicial torture; Christians could not respond to actions brought against them in court; Christian senators, equestrians, decurions, veterans, and soldiers were deprived of their ranks; and Christian imperial freedmen were re-enslaved.|$|E
500|$|Masato Kato {{directed}} {{and wrote the}} main story, leaving sub-plots and minor character events to other staff. The event team sometimes struggled to mesh their work on the plot due {{to the complexity of}} the parallel worlds concept. Masato Kato confirmed that Cross featured a central theme of parallel worlds, as well as the fate of Schala, which he was previously unable to expound upon in Chrono Trigger. Concerning the ending sequences showing Kid searching for someone in a modern city, he hoped to make players realize that alternate futures and possibilities may exist in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives,</b> <b>and</b> that this realization would [...] "not... stop with the game". He later added, [...] "Paraphrasing one novelist's favorite words, what's important is not the message or theme, but how it is portrayed as a game. Even in Cross, it was intentionally made so that the most important question was left unanswered." [...] Kato described the finished story as [...] "ole' boy-meets-girl type of story" [...] with sometimes-shocking twists. Kato rode his motorcycle to relieve the stress of the game's release schedule. He continued refining event data during the final stages of development {{while the rest of the}} team undertook debugging and quality control work. Square advertised the game by releasing a short demo of the first chapter with purchases of Legend of Mana. The North American version of Cross required three months of translation and two months of debugging before release. Richard Honeywood translated, working with Kato to rewrite certain dialogue for ease of comprehension in English. He also added instances of wordplay and alliteration to compensate for difficult Japanese jokes. To streamline translation for all 45 playable characters, Honeywood created his own version of the accent generator which needed to be more robust than the simple verbal tics of the Japanese cast. Although the trademark Chrono Cross was registered in the European Union, the game was not released in Europe.|$|E

They first crossed paths in 1989 in La Paz, Bolivia, the capital of what remains to this day as the poorest country in South America. Their initial {{training}} programs focused on helping women develop invaluable life skills in business, health and leadership. Patterson and Velasco believed that women were key to breaking the cycle of poverty. {{in order to do}} this, women first needed to be the leading protagonists of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>live</b> <b>and</b> needed easy and convenient access to basic human services. Patterson and Velasco provided a space where women could connect with one another for mutual support and encouragement. It was not long before the women they served told them that they desperately needed access to capital in order to put theory into practice.|$|R

Instead their adult caregivers, including parents, social workers, teachers, youth workers, and others, are vested with that authority, depending on the circumstances. Some believe that this state of affairs gives children insufficient control over <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> causes them to be vulnerable.

40|$|What {{does it mean}} to {{bear witness}} to the {{memories}} of previous generations’ trauma victims? What lessons should we learn from those who came before us to ensure a happier future? This thesis explores the trauma and memories of the deceased or older generation found in J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series. I intend to analyze the character of Harry Potter as he interacts with the memories of the previous generation, which he is able to resurrect in embodied forms through the use of magic. By testifying to the memories of the previous generations’ trauma, Harry is able to break the cycle of violence and create a seemingly happy ending to his life’s story. Through critically studying Harry Potter as a transgenerational narrative, readers are able to learn how to bear witness to the memories of those with whom they associate in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>live</b> <b>and</b> create a more empathetically inclined world...|$|R
