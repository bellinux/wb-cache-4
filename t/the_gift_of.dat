5|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known nativity scene in America is the Neapolitan Baroque Crèche {{displayed}} annually in the Medieval Sculpture Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Its backdrop is a 1763 choir screen from the Cathedral of Valladolid and a twenty-foot blue spruce decorated {{with a host of}} 18th-century angels. The nativity figures are placed at the tree's base. The crèche was <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> Loretta Hines Howard in 1964, and the choir screen was <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> The William Randolph Hearst Foundation in 1956. Both this presepio and the one displayed in Pittsburgh originated from the collection of Eugenio Catello.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{building on}} the present site was constructed in the late 13th or early 14th century, at {{around the same time}} as the friary, which was founded in about 1296. Its hilltop location is unusual for the area; most nearby churches are built on mounds near water. The new church was dedicated to Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of sailors, and the living was first recorded as being in <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> Sir John de Cockfield, passing to his Bacon descendants before its acquisition by the Abbot and Convent of Langley in 1375. The abbey controlled more than 60 Norfolk parishes, and the living of Blakeney was within its gift for the next sixty years, ending with the dissolution of the abbey in 1435. The patronage seems then to have passed to the Earl of Sussex, but quickly transferred to John Calthorpe, a descendant of the original founder, John Cockfield, and it remained with his family until 1922. Sir Alfred Jodrell then acquired the patronage, bequeathing it to Keble College, Oxford on his death in 1956. Since 1989, the benefice has been in <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> Keble College, and the Bishop of Norwich.|$|E

5|$|He also {{missed the}} {{opportunity}} to lead the original Sinister Six because he felt that joining the group would mean admitting he needed the help of others to rid himself of Spider-Man. Although he later formed the 'Sinister Twelve' when Spider-Man sent him to prison, he expressed anger at Mac Gargan for acquiring the Venom symbiote rather than using the new Scorpion suit provided for him simply because Gargan was not doing what he wanted, despite Venom being {{more powerful than the}} Scorpion. When he participated in the mystical ritual known as the Gathering of Five, he appeared convinced that he would automatically receive <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> power from the ritual– which would bestow upon the participants power, immortality, knowledge, madness and death, respectively– only to receive <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> madness instead, subsequently requiring an elaborate cocktail of drugs to restore himself to a semblance of sanity. During his time in charge of H.A.M.M.E.R. he was provoked into attacking Asgard by his Goblin side because his ego couldn't allow himself to consider the possibility that the Asgardians wouldn't threaten his power. Later events revealed that Loki at least slightly influenced Osborn's decision to further Loki's own goals. During his attempted takeover of Earth's superhuman security defenses, he was shown reflecting that humans are all barbarians who require the strong like him to control them, dismissing the Avengers as no better than him despite the obvious distinction between Osborn's demands for power and the straightforward respect that the general public have for the Avengers.|$|E
5|$|He {{held the}} vicarage of Lochrutton in Kirkcudbrightshire in 1388, when a papal letter {{indicated}} that {{he was expected to}} resign Lochrutton after obtaining the benefice of Maybole in <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> the Prioress of the nunnery of North Berwick. He still held Lochrutton on 18 April 1390, when the letter was repeated. Thomas remained provost of Maybole until at least 1401, and perhaps until his consecration as Bishop of Galloway in 1415. No-one else is known to have held the position of provost there until 1439, although this proves nothing as the evidence for such things in the south-west of Scotland in this period is always scarce.|$|E

5|$|Leicester Abbey {{was founded}} in 1143 by Robert le Bossu, 2nd Earl of Leicester, and was {{dedicated}} to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. It {{was not the first}} abbey Robert had established, having founded Garendon Abbey, also in Leicestershire, in 1133. Robert's father, Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester, had previously founded a college of secular canons in Leicester, known as The College of St Mary de Castro. The new abbey assumed control of the college and its possessions, which included all of the churches in Leicester. Robert added to this with <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> numerous churches in Leicestershire, Berkshire and Northamptonshire. The abbey also gained the manor of Asfordby from its merger with the college, and the manor of Knighton from its founder.|$|E
