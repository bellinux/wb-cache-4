40|$|SummaryPurposeTo {{investigate}} {{changes in}} levetiracetam (LEV) serum concentration/dose ratio (C/D-ratio) {{in relation to}} pregnancy. MethodsAltogether 21 consecutive pregnancies in 20 women with epilepsy receiving LEV during gestation were studied retrospectively. The main target variable was the C/D-ratio before and during pregnancy, and in the post partum period. <b>Secondary</b> <b>target</b> <b>variables</b> were changes in LEV dose, concomitant use of other antiepileptic drugs and seizure frequency. Student's paired t-test and two-sample t-test for independent samples were used to test for statistically significant changes in C/D-ratio means. ResultsMean C/D-ratio in the third trimester was 50 % of the mean C/D-ratio at baseline (p< 0. 001, n= 11). Baseline levels were reached within the first weeks after pregnancy. The interindividual variability was pronounced. ConclusionsSerum concentrations of LEV declined significantly in the third trimester of pregnancy and increased rapidly after delivery...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of modeling permeability in petroleum geology and engineering is rivaled by {{the difficulty in}} obtaining sufficient data. In practice, two- or threedimensional models of permeability that include spatial variation must depend on qualitative information or data from which permeability can be inferred through empirical relationships. For instance, a significant regression of permeability on porosity occurs in many reservoirs, {{and can be used}} to estimate permeability. Collocated cosimulation is but one method for supplementing a primary data with a <b>secondary</b> <b>variable</b> such as porosity when generating equiprobable realizations of permeability. These methods rely on a <b>secondary</b> <b>variable</b> that is sampled more densely than the primary variable, and a measure of the dependency, expressed as the covariance or correlation coefficient between the two variables. Collocated cosimulation was originally proposed for use when the <b>secondary</b> <b>variable</b> is observed on a dense grid, such as with seismic data (Xu and others, 1992).

Here we present a method for adaptive surface modeling of combined <b>secondary</b> <b>variables</b> to improve prediction accuracy during the interpolation of soil properties (ASM-SP). Using various <b>secondary</b> <b>variables</b> and multiple base interpolation models, ASM-SP was used to interpolate soil K+ in a typical complex geomorphic area (Qinghai Lake Basin, China). Five methods, including inverse distance weighting (IDW), ordinary kriging (OK), and OK combined with different <b>secondary</b> <b>variables</b> (e. g., OK-Landuse, OK-Geology, and OK-Soil), were used to validate the proposed method. The mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean relative error (MRE), and accuracy (AC) were used as evaluation indicators. Results showed that: (1) The OK interpolation result is spatially smooth and has a weak bull's-eye effect, and the IDW has a stronger ‘bull’s-eye’ effect, relatively. They both have obvious deficiencies in depicting spatial variability of soil K+. (2) The methods incorporating combinations of different <b>secondary</b> <b>variables</b> (e. g., ASM-SP, OK-Landuse, OK-Geology, and OK-Soil) were associated with lower estimation bias. Compared with IDW, OK, OK-Landuse, OK-Geology, and OK-Soil, the accuracy of ASM-SP increased by 13. 63 %, 10. 85 %, 9. 98 %, 8. 32 %, and 7. 66 %, respectively. Furthermore, ASM-SP was more stable, with lower MEs, MAEs, RMSEs, and MREs. (3) ASM-SP presents more details than others in the abrupt boundary, which can render the result consistent with the true <b>secondary</b> <b>variables.</b> In conclusion, ASM-SP can not only consider the nonlinear relationship between <b>secondary</b> <b>variables</b> and soil properties, but can also adaptively combine the advantages of multiple models, which contributes to making the spatial interpolation of soil K+ more reasonable...|$|R

It was recently discovered that the clustering amplitude of halos depends not only on halo mass, but also on various <b>secondary</b> <b>variables</b> such as halo formation time and concentration; these dependences are collectively termed “assembly bias. ” Using a modified Fisher matrix formalism, we explore whether these <b>secondary</b> <b>variables</b> {{have a significant impact}} on studying the properties of dark energy with self calibration in current (SDSS) and near future (DES, SPT, and LSST) cluster surveys. We find that for an SDSS-like survey, secondary dependences of halo bias are insignificant given the expected large statistical uncertainties in dark energy parameters. For SPT- or DES-like survey volumes, we find that the dependence of halo bias on <b>secondary</b> <b>variables</b> is not a significant systematic provided the scatter in the observable–mass relation is 20 % or lower, as expected for X-ray or SZ surveys. At higher scatter (e. g. values currently possible with optical surveys), significant systematic errors are possible, depending on how strongly the cluster observable correlates with the <b>secondary</b> <b>variables</b> at fixed mass. For an LSST-like survey volume, this systematic is likely to be important even for lower scatter values or for less correlated observables.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the method of}} state diagram synthesis {{and the development of}} a computer program for designing fluidic sequential feedback • control circuits of the fundamental mode. A paper on state diagram synthesis was authored by Chen and Lee, presented in Detroit and published as ASME paper 73 -WA/Flcs- 2 in 1973. Hypothetical systems are illustrated by using series of events characterized by the piston positions of some double-acting pneumatic cylinders. In these systems, an action can only begin when the previous action has been completed. Every extension or retraction of a piston is memorized and manifested by a flip-flop element in the feedback circuit. If different combina- tions of control signals result from different combinations of feedback signals, the logic design is straightforward. Otherwise <b>secondary</b> <b>variables</b> are needed to differentiate between repeated appearances of some ambiguous input combinations. A <b>secondary</b> <b>variable</b> is obtained as the output of a fluidic flip-flop with set and reset inputs.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if certain elemental factors of intrinsic motivation for exercise were related to the physical activity of OPTIFAST obesity treatment patients. Four hundred self-report surveys assessing three sets of variables were distributed in eight OPTIFAST programs. The independent variables were 27 self-report items representing intrinsic motivation constructs. These constructs were based on the "cognitive evaluation" and the "flow" theories. Selected demographic variables were regarded as <b>secondary</b> <b>variables.</b> The dependent variables (reported for one week) included: (a) the total time at three exercise modes, (b) the time spent walking, (c) the time on an indoor aerobic exercise machine, (d) the time at dance/calisthenic routines, (e) the number of exercise sessions, and (f) the average duration of exercise sessions. There were seventy-nine respondents (female = 68, male = 11; mean age = 41. 7 years, S. D. = 8. 15). Factor analysis was utilized to analyze the responses to the intrinsic motivation constructs. The analysis revealed three factors: (1) Competence/Cognitive Efficiency, (2) Enjoyment/Interest, and (3) Challenge/Effort. The internal consistencies of the three scales were high. It was hypothesized that these scales and the <b>secondary</b> <b>variables</b> would be positively related to exercise. Simple correlation coefficients were used to test the relationships between exercise and the three intrinsic motivation scales.

Competence/Cognitive Efficiency significantly related to five exercise variables, with one of these relationships being inverse.

Based on the state-of-the-art which suggest that "the indicators of administrative convergence aim mainly: reliability and predictability; transparency; responsibility; efficiency and effectiveness", the paper proposes a methodological framework to estimate the factors indicating administrative convergence, via the method of factor analysis, which is applied at three steps. The study is based on the questionnaire developed within the frame of the project European Administrative Space (EAS), via NSPSPA; UNIVERSITY OF THE AEGEAN; NEW BULGARIAN UNIVERSITY; UNIVERSITY OF RIJEKA; and EPLO (2010). That questionnaire was designed to include parts referring to the above-mentioned dimensions of administrative convergence.

The methodological approach is as follows: At the first step, the factor analysis performed for the characteristics of each <b>secondary</b> <b>variable,</b> resulted to the factors indicating that variable. The estimated values of the extracted factors were then considered as new variables. At step 2, a factor analysis of those new variables corresponding to the same primary variable was performed, resulting to the factors indicating that primary variable.
