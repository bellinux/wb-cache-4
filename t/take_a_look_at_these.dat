30|$|The {{most serious}} {{instance}} of a second-order neglect of relevant futures is the ignorance of invisible groups. This {{is happening in}} the academic and political discourse with regard to extreme forms of poverty in Europe. It can be demonstrated – see section 3 – that such neglect can be identified for the European Union and its Member States. The fact that it is precisely those affected by extreme poverty that are in this way neglected calls for action on a first-order and on a second-order level. Overcoming the second-order neglect of the relevant futures of these groups is a necessary and first step towards establishing choices about relevant futures for these persons. In order to do that, poverty alleviation discourses have to “see” these “invisible” groups and have to adapt their analytical tools accordingly. Let us <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> two steps separately.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Although state certificate-of-need (CON) {{programs}} {{have been the subject}} of intense criticism over the past decade, recent evidence suggests that CON pro-grams may be more effective than commonly believed. While many state {{programs have}} yielded disappointing results, the CON process can also be used to achieve other important policy objectives, such as increasing access to care for the uninsured and increasing lay participation in health policy planning. In sum, rather than fading away after the termination of federal support for health planning in 1986, state CON programs are poised to assume new roles during the 1990 s. After a decade in which regulatory solutions to rising health care costs, and certificate-of-need (CON) regulation in particular, fell out of favor among academics, policymakers, and health providers, health planning and capital expenditure controls have resurfaced on the health policy agenda in the 1990 s.

Starting in the mid 1970 s a steadily growing and astonishing diversity of micropump principles, technical concepts and applications has emerged in this area. Until today MEMS science is delivering a constant flow of novel modelling approaches, microstructured materials, actuation principles, fabrication technologies and applications, that are readily taken and transferred into micropump research.

This chapter will <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> objects and describe {{the state of the art}} in their construction. It is important to stress that blockciphers are just tools [...] raw ingredients for cooking up something more useful. Blockciphers don't, by themselves, do something that an end-user would care about. As with any powerful tool, one has to learn to use this one. Even an excellent blockcipher won't give you security if you use don't use it right. But used well, these are powerful tools indeed. Accordingly, an important theme in several upcoming chapters will be on how to use blockciphers well. We won't be emphasizing how to design or analyze blockciphers, as this remains very much an art. This chapter gets you acquainted with some typical blockciphers, and discusses attacks on them. In particular we'll look at two examples, DES and AES. DES is the &quot;old standby. &quot; It is currently the most widely-used blockcipher in existence, and it is of sufficient historical significance that every trained cryptographer needs to have seen its description. AES is a modern blockcipher, and it is expected to supplant DES in the years to come...|$|E

Large-scale batch processes {{can lead to}} an unresponsive and wasteful supply chain. This thesis explores supply chain design and operational improvements that can mitigate the effects large-scale batch steps have on the overall performance of the supply chain. Specifically, the thesis investigates: 1. The applicability of using customer demand signals to drive upstream production processes. 2. Methods for mitigating effects of long component lead times. 3. Reducing the disparity between scheduling and manufacturing lead times The thesis also describes various simulations created to explore the above issues. These simulations were key discovery tools in finding creative {{ways to reduce the}} large-scale batch process effects. The results, respectively, are: 1. The decision to use customer demand signals to drive upstream production processes depends on the operational characteristics of the production process. 2. Provided certain conditions exist, a method, the Second Look Process, can improve supply chain responsiveness in the face of long lead-times. 3. An organization must realize its processes can impose inefficiencies in its supply chain operations; it must <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> inefficiencies and balance them with the organizational costs of eliminating them.

40|$|Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a {{disability}} that affects many different people {{in many different}} ways. The impact the TBI has on a person’s life varies considerably based on {{the severity of the}} injury and other psychosocial factors. TBI is one of the disabilities that can and does affect people from all cultures, all age groups, and all socioeconomic groups. It is also known to some as the “invisible disability” because it can present with no obvious visible manifestations and also because the nature of the disability can impact the individual with the TBI’s ability to fully understand their own disability. Recently, the US military has begun seeing an increase in the prevalence of TBI within its service members. This increase has been attributed to the type of weapons and conditions that the US military is routinely facing as well as changes in medical care for service members which makes it more likely that they will survive what, in the past, would have been a fatal injury. Brain injuries in the military create some issues that are unique to its ranks such as adjustment to civilian life, reintegration into the family unit, and others. The diagnosis and treatment of TBI has caused some unique challenges for the U. S. government; and as a result has {{led to the development of}} a new system of medical care. The military, the Department of Defense, and the US government as a whole have responded to this need by creating several new organizations, as well as passing new legislation.

40|$|Earl 1 was a sweet, {{slightly}} chubby, teenager when I {{first met}} him at the shelter for runaway and homeless youth where I worked. He was also a street-smart hustler who traded sex for money or room and board whenever necessary. He came from a deeply troubled family and had limited formal edu-cation, but Earl was astute. It was Earl who first introduced me to the seamier side of institutional cultures that permit secrets to be buried and abuses to flourish. I have been wiser ever since. As the Penn State story unfolded, I recognized it: different setting, same story. I now eye uneasily a report just released by my uni-versity documenting institutional failures in handling a child pornography matter. It is too similar for comfort. Here I <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> cases side-by-side. A Runaway Shelter: The Case of a Priest I met Earl when I worked at Covenant House, a runaway and homeless youth shelter in New York City. We housed hundreds of kids a night. They came from troubled families and had failed in a variety of systems, so we attempted to plug gaps. I oversaw a small legal department but worked under one roof with other professionals including social workers, doctors, nurses, teachers, and priests. The fit was not always easy, given different professional orientations, but the goal was to help kids. Covenant House was founded by a charismatic Franciscan priest named Bruce Ritter. In the 1960 s, he moved to a dis-advantaged neighborhood to, “live and work among the poor ” (Ritter, 1987, p. 4).

40|$|Leadership {{is the art}} {{of getting}} people to do that which they might not {{otherwise}} do, even when you are not there watching to ensure their actions. An essential element of leadership is power. Power exists all around us in every situation we face on every day. It isn’t good or bad, it just is. Yet, many people are uncomfortable with the idea and concept of power and are reluctant to embrace it, or even discuss it, whether in their work lives or their personal lives. This aversion to embracing power has been taught to us from early childhood. Leaders in all types and sizes of organizations face many challenges as they fulfill their roles. One of the most common areas of difficulty for any leader, especially new leaders, is in dealing with the dynamics of power within their organization. By failing to recognize power within their organization and to effectively harness that power they create many of their own problems. Yet, this topic {{is one of the most}} commonly neglected in Management or Supervisory Development Training, where it exists. The question then becomes, “How do we deal with power as it presents itself within a context?” In 1959 John French and Bertram Raven proposed 5 Bases of Social Power (French 2 ̆ 6 Raven, 1959). These bases of power were Position, Referent, Coercive, Reward, and Punishment. In 1965 Raven revised this list to include a sixth base of power: Information (Raven, 1965). This research has formed the basis for studying leadership, power, influence, communication, and politics ever since. This session will: <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> bases of power and examine how they play out within an organization.

40|$|Men {{who have}} sex with men (MSM) in the US {{experience}} great disparities in health outcomes, most notably in HIV. This dissertation will <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> disparities and offer a framework for understanding their etiology and for understanding the processes by which these disparities are sustained, propagated and eventually broken down. First, we provide an overview of the literature regarding health disparities among MSM and the current theories that exist to understand where these disparities come from. Specifically, we focus on Syndemics Theory and the Theory of Syndemic Production as the best models for understanding health among MSM. Finally, we suggest a new theoretical model, Cultural Resilience Theory, which can be used to conceptualize health promotion within the syndemic framework. We also test components of Syndemics Theory - interaction and mediation - that until now have functioned as assumed premises with no empirical support for their assertion. Finally, we test Cultural Resilience Theory as a model that can be used in prevention programming to break down syndemic processes among MSM. In the final chapter we look into the practical implications of Cultural Resilience Theory as it applies to the prevention (or abatement) of health disparities among MSM. The findings of this study have great public health significance and important implications for HIV prevention among MSM. First, the synergism analysis is the first to test the assertion that co-occurring psychosocial health conditions interact to increase HIV risk among MSM. These results suggest that there is a synergistic effect present. Likewise, the mediation analysis is the first to test the theory of syndemic production that states that early life adversity impacts HIV outcomes through syndemic processes; an assertion that was supported by these analyses. These two studies further our understanding of how syndemics function within MSM to produce health disparities. Finally, we identify several variables that break down syndemic processes through either their negative association with poor health outcomes, or by buffering the pathways from adversity to HIV risk through syndemics. These results will provide the foundation upon which a culturally tailored Theory of Cultural Resilience among MSM can be developed...|$|E

40|$|Amidst {{the trends}} of confessional {{narratives}} and theories of gender performativity that took {{root in the}} 90 s, the feminist maxim "the personal is political" is no longer sufficient {{to account for the}} complexities of women's lives transformed into life-stories and live performances. Given the push to recover silenced women, and the more complex discourse that governs both feminist art and criticism, {{it is not surprising that}} feminist life-writing has found many of its richest realizations in performance. On the feminist stage, history, narrative, bodies, voice, identity and community all converge in three related dramatic forms that we can group under the heading of "life-writing": autobiographical performance, biographical plays and staged oral histories. 	In this study, I <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> forms and argue that each one offers both theoretical obstacles and political possibilities to the feminist playwrights and performers who use them. By placing narratives of real lives within the context of performance, these artists point out the degree to which gender, identity, and history are socially constructed performances and are subject to the manipulations of power. And by highlighting the gender biases embedded in these performative notions, they are then able to revise and reconstruct them within a new framework, one that resists hegemonic power and acknowledges difference. 	In three chapters, I examine how feminist playwrights and performers use body, voice, community and history to create potent rhetoric out of women's life narratives. In the chapter on autobiographical performance, I argue that narratives of the self in performance deconstruct notions of selfhood as a way of avoiding essentialism and establishing female agency. At the same time, however, these narratives rely on historical referentiality and an essentialism of the self to reinforce their efficacy. The chapter on biographical drama asserts that feminist playwrights respond to the imperative to reclaim lost feminist lives, but must do so in ways that subvert the objectifying impulses of life writing. Finally, the oral history chapter shows that the communal subjectivity established in these plays generates feminist notions of community in its performance, even as it advocates for such community among its audiences...|$|E

If you teach about China, or are interested in learning more about how Chinese history is being taught in the United States, <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> innovative websites and programs. 1. Asia for Educators: Based at Columbia University, this website provides a variety of background information for educators on Asia history topics like the Song Dynasty, China and Europe comparisons, Chinese religion, and the Mongols. The website includes images, literature selections, some clips of college professors discussing the topics (you need RealPlayer to view the videos), and links to lesson plans, teaching guides, and other resources. TheAsia in the Curriculum bulletin board is also run by this organization. 2. The Asia Society: The New York-based Asia Society works to promote understanding and interactions between American and Asian institutions. Their “Ask Asia” website includes activities for kids as well as lesson plans for teachers at K- 12 levels. Those {{who are looking for}} ways to integrate Chinese history into their world history curriculums are particularly encouraged to check out the Society’s Silk Road Encounters site. (For more on the Silk Road, see also the China Institute’s From Silk to Oil, downloadable online, and the interactive maps at the University of Washington’s Silk Road site.) 3. Expanding East Asian Studies: Also based at Columbia University, the ExEAS site includes detailed lesson plans, syllabi, and teaching guides on a wide range of East Asian history and literary topics. Mainly targeted toward the college-level, some of the material and activities could be adapted for high school classrooms. 4. Morning Sun: This is a phenomenal website for resources on the Cultural Revolution. Though the website does not contain set lesson plans, it does include translated materials from the 1960 s, clips of movies and revolutionary operas, radio broadcasts, song clips, and many photos. (For another website that relies heavily on images for teaching, see Visualizing Cultures, MIT’s Visualizing Cultures project, run by Japanese historian John Dower and linguist Shigeru Miyagawa. Though mainly focused on Japan, one of the lessons is on the Sino-Japanese war.) 5. Visual Sourcebook of Chinese History: Historian Patricia Ebrey prepared this site which, like Visualizing Cultures, relies on images to cover social history topics like clothing, religion, homes, and gardens ranging in time from ancient China to the twentieth century. 6.

40|$|Markus Granlund is {{an almost}} staggeringly many-sided person. He is a {{prolific}} scholar of first class, the Dean of the Turku School of Economics, capturing and skilful teacher, a family man with four sons, a super-talented ice-hockey player and what not. Everything he does seems to happen with ease and calmness. This is not because his work-life would be without challenges. These are not easy times to be a Dean at a Finnish university, but demanding and turbulent indeed. It {{seems to be a}} “new normal” that funding is a continuously bothering issue and so is indicating systematic high volume and quality performance, nowadays measured in numerous dimensions and in accelerating pace. As the Dean of TSE, Markus has not saved himself from super-committed work and putting himself fully at stake – and {{turned out to be a}} successful dean. It is certainly of much help that Markus is a man who can find humour even in the toughest situations and conditions. This is a fabulous feature in anybody: sense of humour, especially warm irony, is an ice-breaker and relaxer for all. It is also almost impossible to pull his leg. He seems always ready to see directly behind such attempts and to me this is one aspect of his superb sense of humour. Working with him has never been only work, but always a lot of fun, too. Markus is my closest colleague of all times. We started collaborating in the early 1990 s, when we conducted a survey research on cost and management accounting practices in Finland. Soon thereafter we were jointly responsible for the scholarly program of the EAA Congress that was held in Turku in 1993 as members of the organizing committee. Oh boy that we had good times in doing that! Over the years, Markus and I have conducted several management accounting studies together, most of which leading to an international journal publication. Our collaboration has always taken place in the spirit of total quality in our work: to carry out each and every bit of the work processes so that quality is ensured right from the beginning. This “total quality principle” was essential in the biggest joint project I have conducted with Markus. It was teaming up for running the editorial office of the European Accounting Review in 2000 - 2005 – Markus first as an Assistant Editor and soon an Associate Editor, splendidly supporting me as the Editor. There are no words to indicate how thankful I am for the highly professional scholarly and administrative support that Markus offered me during those hectic years, during which we so intensively worked for developing the journal towards being a more and more respected outlet for serious scholarly publications in accounting. We shared the same vision of making the journal globally known as the paradigmatically, methodologically and theoretically open-minded accounting journal. Our joint efforts also paid off: European Accounting Review has been an ISI indexed journal now for more than ten years and it is ranked at level 3 in the ABS ranking (and Jufo 2 in Finland). That said, journal and university rankings and league tables have never been the major driving force for Markus. Yet he knows we are in the world with others, so we cannot entirely omit rankings and that sort of things. But Markus is consistent in not allowing the “tail wag the dog” even in these times of publish or perish. He has systematically resisted the lures of letting the measures and proxies of academic performance take the primary role in academic work. Good scholarship is a central value for Markus, always over and above just looking great in terms of performance indicators. It adds to the picture of many-sidedness of Markus that, in addition to being an Accounting Professor, he has also held a position as a Professor of Information Systems Science at TSE for some time. In fact, Markus is certainly one of the leading management accounting and information systems scholars in the world. Despite his being the Dean, he is an Associate Editor of International Journal of Accounting Information Systems. Along this line of thought, Markus has always been an extremely international scholar. He has, for instance, visited Copenhagen Business School and University of Technology Sydney for longer periods. He has collaborated with many scholars both nationally and internationally. The works in this volume, which are prepared in the huge appreciation of Markus Granlund celebrating his 50 th birthday, nicely echo the many-sidedness of the person they are written for. They form a collection of several kinds of texts: scholarly pieces, personal recollections and poems. All these works are clearly conducted with warm thoughts on Markus, a chap of great wit and charm. I wish to express my sincere thanks to all contributors to this volume, feeling assured that Markus will pretty curiously <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> works that are written for him with caring collegial and friendly appreciation. Special thanks are devoted to Karolina Laine, who has greatly helped me in the editorial work for this book...|$|E
