Dali considered the giraffe to be a symbol of masculinity, and a flaming giraffe {{was meant to be a}} [...] "masculine cosmic apocalyptic monster". Several children's books feature the giraffe, including David A. Ufer's The Giraffe Who Was Afraid of Heights, Giles Andreae's Giraffes Can't Dance and Roald Dahl's The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me. Giraffes have appeared in animated films, as minor characters in Disney's The Lion King and Dumbo, and in more prominent roles in The Wild and in the Madagascar films.

50|$|A <b>teether</b> is a toy {{given to}} {{teething}} infants as soothing tool to help soothe inflamed gums during teething. It {{used to be}} wooden but now made of plastic & rubbers. Often filled with a fluid or gel that can be frozen or refrigerated.|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} of a cave in Gámeza, Boyacá in 2007, proved also children were mummified; a mummified baby {{of a couple of}} months old was wrapped in cotton cloths and accompanied by a <b>teether,</b> a small bowl, three strings of cotton and a small bag around the neck.|$|E
5000|$|Infants put {{anything}} within reach into their mouths. It {{is also important}} to keep all objects that enter baby's mouths (such as pacifiers and <b>teethers)</b> clean. Though research into [...] five-second rule has been done, results are inconclusive.|$|R
5000|$|Many common baby products, such as <b>teethers,</b> bath books, {{and sleep}} accessories, contain toxic chemicals, {{according}} to a report released by the US Public Interest Research Group (PIRG). The toxic chemicals include phthalates and polybrominated diphenyl ethers, both of which have been linked to multiple health problems including the following: ...|$|R
50|$|Infants chew on {{objects to}} aid in the {{teething}} process. This can be dangerous if the baby is allowed to chew on objects which are small enough to be swallowed or which could break while being chewed and cause choking. Teething rings and other toys, called <b>teethers,</b> are often designed with textures that will appeal to an infant during teething. Drawing water into a pacifier and freezing it as another way to offer a teething child relief. The cold pressure on the gums gives relief without making the child’s fingers cold.|$|R

50|$|A {{pacifier}} (American English) or dummy (British English), {{also known}} as a binky, soother or <b>teether,</b> is a rubber, plastic or silicone nipple given to an infant to suck upon. In its standard appearance it has a teat, mouth shield, and handle. The mouth shield and/or the handle is large enough to avoid the danger of the child choking on it or swallowing it.|$|E

The company was founded as Mii in 2010, by Craig Sirota and Marlena Sirota, a mother of 6 and an environmental health advocate, who played an instrumental role in ending the sale of all products containing BPA in Chicago. The first range of products were patented breast pumps; borosilicate glass bottles and ForEverTM [...] In January 2017, the company launched a new product line, Mii BabyTM, along with the co-brands Mii by Sophie the Giraffe, a popular <b>teether</b> based in France.|$|E
40|$|Plastic, one of {{the most}} {{preferred}} materials in today′s industrial world is posing serious threat to environment and consumer′s health in many direct and indirect ways. Exposure to harmful chemicals during manufacturing, leaching in the stored food items while using plastic packages or chewing of plastic <b>teethers</b> and toys by children are linked with severe adverse health outcomes such as cancers, birth defects, impaired immunity, endocrine disruption, developmental and reproductive effects etc. Promotion of plastics substitutes and safe disposal of plastic waste requires urgent and definitive action {{to take care of this}} potential health hazard in future...|$|R
40|$|Ecologists have {{recently}} been cautioned {{about the potential for}} complex interactive artefacts to complicate the interpretation of field and laborator experiments. This study in northern Australia tested for such effects in 2 methods commonly used to investigate herbivory and predation in mangrove forests: tethering and caging. There was no evidence that <b>teethering</b> leaves or propagules caused biases which would invalidate comparisons among habitats, but the method was likely to underestimate the intensity of feeding on propagules. There was also little evidence that cages had any effect on seedlings other than to reduce the intensity of herbivory. The results indicate that these methods are likely to provide useful, and non-problematic, information about the role of herbivory in mangrove forests...|$|R
30|$|According to the BTHD, {{context is}} not only related to the {{physical}} conditions of the environment but also to how it is perceived by developing individuals and how they experience the subjectivity of this experience, thereby allowing positive and negative polarities to coexist to varying degrees regarding the experience. This issue, referenced by Bronfenbrenner (2001), can be analysed when considering the ambivalence shown by some mothers {{regarding the use of}} a pacifier for their children. Despite their assessment that pacifier use is not innocuous, they recognised that it helps to calm infants. Furthermore, the pacifier is considered by mothers as a way to calm the infant that can be easily removed compared with finger sucking because mothers and other family members intensely interfered to curb this behaviour by removing the fingers from the infants’ mouth and offering pacifiers or <b>teethers.</b>|$|R

The bill {{came to be}} known as the [...] "Rubber Duck Bill", so named because phthalates are often used in the manufacture of soft plastic toys and baby <b>teethers.</b> Arnold Schwarzenegger, then governor of California, signed the bill into law in October 2007; it took effect in January 2009. Ma's legislation was later incorporated into Senator Dianne Feinstein's [...] federal Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 signed by President George W. Bush on August 15, 2008. She also worked on the creation of statewide high-speed rail, granting equal rights to men and women to change their last names when they are married or become domestic partners, and was a co-author of SB 840, a bill that would create a single payer universal health care system throughout California.|$|R
60|$|In those idyllic days, {{while they}} were making their way, and {{counting}} the cost of every step {{as if it were}} the proverbial first step, the next step for Lindora was a large boarding-house for the summer. She tried it first in the country, and she tried it next at the seaside, with the same number of feet of piazza in both cases, and with no distinct difference except in the price. It was always dearer at the seaside, but if it had been better she should not have thought it so dear. Yet, as it was dearer, she could not help thinking it was better; and there was the beach for the <b>teethers</b> to dig in, and there was an effect of superior fashion in the gossipers on the piazza, one to every three of the three hundred feet of the piazza, rocking and talking, and guessing at the yachts in the offing, and then bathing and coming out to lie on the sand and dry their hair.|$|R
40|$|A faster, {{simpler and}} {{sensitive}} method {{was developed for}} determination of aliphatic phthalates using differential pulse polarography (DPP) as standard technique. The choice and concentration of base electrolyte, solvent, initial potential, effect of water addition and interference by other phthalates were the main parameters to optimize for enhancement of peak current and to obtain well-defined polarogram with lower background current using 1. 3 x 10 - 4 M di-butyl phthalate (DBP) solution. Best results were obtained {{in the presence of}} tetra methyl ammonium bromide (TMAB) as electrolyte in methanol solvent with initial potential, - 1. 4 V. A linear calibration plot was observed in the range of 3 x 10 - 7 – 1. 6 x 10 - 4 M DBP solution as aliphatic phthalates with lower detection limit of 5. 9 x 10 - 8 M and linear regression coefficient of 0. 9987. The developed polarographic method was successfully applied for analysis of aliphtaic phthalates in various samples of locally available polymer products such as baby toys, nipples, <b>teethers,</b> infusion blood bags and shopping bags. The results of the current method were compared with those obtained by a reported method and good agreement was found between them...|$|R

30|$|The {{participation}} of individuals {{involved in the}} informal social support with regard to pacifier use was assessed {{for their ability to}} influence the mothers’ decisions. In most cases, it was found that pacifier use was encouraged by grandparents, great-grandparents, and uncles (60  %), while in 30  % of the 20 cases pacifier use was stimulated by mothers themselves and in 10  % by fathers. Extended relatives became especially important when the mother returned to work and depended on them to care for their infant. In general, family members encouraged pacifier use and only 35  % disagreed. Regarding finger sucking, however, at the 24  months follow-up, mothers and family members were observed to strongly discourage their infant from this sucking habit. Mothers in Group A removed the infants’ fingers from their mouth and placed a pacifier or a <b>teether</b> in their mouth. Mothers in Group B used a <b>teether</b> or cloth for this purpose. At 18  months, 24.2  % of infants attended day care; at 24  months, 42.4  % did so.|$|E
5000|$|During August 2008, the United States Congress {{passed and}} President George W. Bush signed the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA), which became public law 110-314. Section 108 of that law {{specified}} {{that as of}} February 10, 2009, [...] "it shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture for sale, offer for sale, distribute in commerce, or import into the United States any children's toy or child care article that contains concentrations of more than 0.1 percent of" [...] DEHP, DBP, or BBP and [...] "it shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture for sale, offer for sale, distribute in commerce, or import into the United States any children's toy that can {{be placed in a}} child's mouth or child care article that contains concentrations of more than 0.1 percent of" [...] DINP, DIDP, DnOP. Furthermore, the law requires the establishment of a permanent review board to determine the safety of other phthalates. Prior to this legislation, the Consumer Product Safety Commission had determined that voluntary withdrawals of DEHP and DINP from <b>teethers,</b> pacifiers, and rattles had eliminated the risk to children, and advised against enacting a phthalate ban.|$|R
5000|$|STATS {{produces}} an annual list called the [...] "Dubious Data Awards", highlighting egregious factual inaccuracies in news reporting. In 2006, it challenged {{a study by}} the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, used by The New York Times and Forbes, which claimed that almost half of the alcohol industry's revenue came from underage drinkers. According to STATS, American teenagers who drink alcohol would each have to consume more than 1,000 drinks per year for this to be true. STATS has also disagreed with recommendations from Time that parents should discontinue use of soft vinyl toys, <b>teethers,</b> and similar products containing phthalates. STATS made this case {{based on the fact that}} phthalates in children's toys have been cleared for use by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission; however, the European Union's Institute for Health and Consumer Protection has taken the opposite position, restricting the use of phthalate plasticizers in children's toys since 1998 and banning their manufacture in the E.U. in 2015 due to persistent health concerns. [...] The annual list has received coverage from The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, among other news organizations.|$|R
5000|$|Pacifiers were {{settling}} into their modern form around 1900 when the first teat, shield and handle design was patented in the US as a [...] "baby comforter" [...] by Manhattan pharmacist Christian W. Meinecke. [...] Rubber {{had been used in}} flexible <b>teethers</b> sold as [...] "elastic gum rings" [...] for British babies in the mid-19th century, and also used for feeding-bottle teats. In 1902, Sears, Roebuck & Co. advertised a [...] "new style rubber teething ring, with one hard and one soft nipple".

[...] In England too, dummies were seen as something the [...] "poorer classes" [...] would use, and associated with poor hygiene. In 1914 a London doctor complained about [...] "the dummy teat": [...] "If it falls on the floor it is rubbed momentarily on the mother's blouse or apron, lipped by the mother and replaced in the baby's mouth." ...|$|R
60|$|Lindora {{was tired}} of always going to the same place, sick and tired; and, {{as far as she}} could see, all those mountain-places were the same places. She could get no good of the air if she bored herself; the nice people did not go to hotels so much now, anyway, and the {{children}} were dreadful, no fit associates for the <b>teethers,</b> who had long ceased to teethe but needed a summer outing as much as ever. A series of seasons followed when the married pair did not know where to go, in the person of the partner who represented them, and they had each spring a controversy vividly resembling a quarrel, but which was really not a quarrel, because the Dear knew that if it were not for the children Lindora would only be too glad never to leave their own house winter or summer, but just to stick there, year out and year in. Then, at least, she could look a little after Florindo, who had lived so much at the club that he had fairly forgotten he had a wife and children. The trouble was all with Florindo, anyway; he cared more for his business than his family, much; if he did not, he could have managed somehow to spend the summers with them. Other men did it, and ran down once a month, or once a fortnight, to put things in shape, and then came back.|$|R
6000|$|After that, say {{the third}} summer of their marriage, it {{appeared}} to Lindora essential to take board somewhere for the whole summer, at such an easy distance that Florindo could run up or down or out every Saturday afternoon and stay Sunday with her and the children; for there had now begun to be children, who could not teethe in town, and for whom the abundance of pure milk, small fruits, and fresh vegetables promised with the shade and safety of the farm was really requisite. She kept the house in town still open, as before, or rather half-open, for she left only the cook in it {{to care for her}} husband, and do the family wash, sent to and fro by express, while she took the second girl with her as maid. In the first days of September, when the most enterprising of the fresh vegetables were beginning to appear on the table, and the mosquitoes were going, and the smell of old potatoes in the cellar and rats in the walls was airing out, and she was getting used to the peculiar undulations of her bed, she took the little <b>teethers</b> back to town with her; and when she found her husband in the comfortable dimensions of their own house, with melons and berries and tender steak, and rich cream (such as never comes on [...] "pure milk"), and hot and cold baths, and no flies, she could not help feeling that he had been very selfish. Now she understood, at least, why he never failed on Monday morning to wake in time for the stage to carry him to the station, and she said, No more farm-board for her if she knew it.|$|R
60|$|At {{the farm}} she had paid seven {{dollars a week}} for herself, and half-price for the children; at the country boarding-house she had paid ten for herself, and again half-price for the children; at the seaside boarding-house the rate for her was {{fourteen}} dollars, and nine {{for the children and}} the maid. Everybody on the piazza said it was very cheap, but to Lindora it was so dear that she decided for Florindo that they could not go on keeping the house open and the cook in it just for him, as the expressage on the wash took away all the saving in that. If she allowed him to sleep in the house, he could pick up his meals for much less than they now cost. They must not burn their candle at both ends; he must put out his end. There was reason in this, because now Florindo was sometimes kept so late at business that he could not get the last train Saturday night for the beach, and he missed the Sunday with his family on which she counted so much. Thinking these things over during the ensuing winter, she began to divine, toward spring, that the only thing for the <b>teethers,</b> and the true way for Florindo, was for her {{to get away from the}} city to a good distance, where there would be a real change of air, and that a moderate hotel in the White Mountains or the Adirondacks was the only hopeful guess at their problem. If Florindo could not come for Sunday when they were off only an hour or two, it would be no worse for them to be seven or eight hours off. Florindo agreed the more easily because he had now joined a club, where he got his meals as comfortably as at home and quite as economically, counting in the cook. He could get a room also at the club, and if they shut the house altogether, and had it wired by the burglar-insurance company, they would be cutting off a frightful drain.|$|R
