The Effect of different culture {{conditions such as}} pH, temperature, NaCl percentage (w/v) and dye concentration was studied by using one factor at a time (OFAT) method. Halomonas strain D 2 was capable of decolorizing <b>Toluidine</b> <b>Red</b> at a pH and temperature range of 6. 5 - 9. 5 and 25 °C- 40 °C respectively and the best decolorization was achieved at 25 ppm dye concentration, pH 6. 5, temperature 35 °C and 5 % (w/v) NaCl. UV-Vis and HPLC analysis suggested that decolorization was occurred under biodegradation mechanism rather than biosorption. GC/MS analysis was done to identify degradation products. Final compounds formed from dye degradation appeared at m/z 193 and m/z 77 which were identified as 2 -(2 -carboxy vinyl) benzoic acid and Benzene respectively. Related pathway for biodegradation mechanism was proposed.

The virus, Type A, strain 1, CANEFA of Argentine origin, was grown in tissue culture and tested in the crude and clarified state. Virus and dye were mixed and incubated together at 4 C for 45 min in the dark, or were mixed and immediately exposed to the visible light source without prior incubation together. Mixtures of crude virus and dye, under any of the experimental conditions used, did not inactivate more than 1 to 2 logs of viral infectivity when held in the dark or when exposed to light during a period of 45 min. Complete inactivation of virus was achieved when clarified virus and dye were mixed and immediately exposed to the visible light source for 15 min. Prior incubation of clarified virus and dye permitted inactivation by methylene blue only, whereas no incubation prior to exposure resulted in three of the dyes contributing to inactivation. A concentration of 6 μg of neutral <b>red,</b> <b>Toluidine</b> Blue, methylene blue, and crystal violet was used per milliliter of virus suspension.

In the present study, we investigate the effect of photoactivated disinfection using riboflavin as a photosensitizer and blue LED light for activation, and compare it to photoacti-vated disinfection with the widely used combination of toluidine blue O and red light. Ribofla-vin is highly biocompatible and can be activated with LED lamps at hand in the dental office. To date, no reports {{are available on the}} antimicrobial effect of photoactivated disinfection using riboflavin/blue light on oral microorganisms. Planktonic cultures of eight organisms frequently isolated from periodontal and/or endodontic lesions (Aggregatibacter actinomy-cetemcomitans, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherischia coli, Lactobacillus paracasei, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Propionibacterium acnes) were subjected to photoactivated disinfection with riboflavin/blue light and <b>toluidine</b> blue O/ <b>red</b> light, and survival rates were determined by CFU counts.

40|$|The mucus {{secretion}} of S. noctilio induces {{a series}} of degradative changes in the tissues of P. radiata needles, which result in chlorosis and desiccation, and ultimtely death. Dramatic changes are recorded in the respiratory rate and mode, and activities of amylase and peroxidase, in tissues which develop severe symptoms. These changes {{are associated with the}} destruction of chloroplasts, excessive loss of moisture and necrosis of food conducting elements. Basic similarities between changes caused by s. noctilio mucus, and natural and induced senescence of other plant foliage are discussed, It is also suggested that plant hormones confer a degree of resistance to the effects of Sirex mucus. Some physiological and biochemical changes (e. g., respiration and chlorophyll) are almost immediate upon treatment of P. radiata with autoclaved mucus. This is partly due to the faster uptake of autoclaved mucus solution which is also less viscous than raw mucus solution, Raw mucus has an estimated molecular weight of 60, 000 - 100, 000. In an aqueous solution, it undergoes slow spontaneous disaggregation with loss of viscosity to yield dialysable subunits of molecular weight 2, 000 - 6, 000, which are physiologically active, Rapid disaggregations are brought about by treatment with moderate concentrations of `NaCl`, `KCl`, or `CaCl_ 2 `, or by heating, but not with urea, The presence of amylase, esterase, acid phosphatase, phenoloxidase and proteolytic enzyme activities in native mucus may be partly responsible for the process of "natural disaggregation. The mucus appears to be a fairly homogeneous polysaccharide - protein complex with properties of both a neutral and an acid polysaccharide. The acidic polysaccharide bears close similarities to mammalian hyaluronic acid in its reactions to histochemical stains. Thus, it reacts with basic dyes at pH 3 - 7, it is orthochromatic in <b>toluidine</b> blue, <b>red</b> in acridine orange, blue - green in alcian blue, and its reactions with alcian blue appears to be mediated through its carboxyl groups, however, it shows high resistance to mammalian hyaluronidase. Two major polysaccharide - protein complexes, both with physiological activities, are separated f'rom DEAE - Sephadex, using autoclaved mucus. The first complex is eluted in 0. 1 - 0. 4 M `NaCl`, and appears to be a collageneous type of sulphated glycoprotein, consisting mainly of fucose, galactose, glucosamine and galacturonic acid. The second complex is eluted in 0. 5 - 0. 9 M `NaCl`, and appears to be a conjugate of sulphated glycoprotein and hyaluronate type of acid mucopolysaccharide. A total of five hexoses (i. e., rhamnose, fucose, mannose, glucose and galactose) 1 two hexuronic acids (i. e, glucuronic acid and galacturonic acid), and two hexosamines (i. e., glucosamine and galactosamine) are present. The mucus secretion of S. noctilio is compared with extracellular secretions of microbes which also induce senescence of their host plants. A brief study of mucus secretions from two other siricids, i. e., Urocerus gigas and Xeris spectrum, reveals the presence of protein and carbohydrate, but these secretions do not induce foliar senescence of P. radiata, and probably indicates a high specificity of wasp to host tree species...|$|R

Despite therapy, infectious diseases remain a leading cause of mortality and the growing phenomenon of drug resistance is an emerging problem. Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) has been studied for antimicrobial purposes and antitumor applications. In order to test PDT on fungal infections, we applied the same protocols in vitro on Candida albicans in planktonic cultures and in biofilms models, using also new molecules for antifungal therapy, and in vivo in a model of C. albicans infection in larvae of Galleria mellonella. We performed PDT with 3 laser prototypes using 405, 532 and 650 nm wavelength with 3 fluences for in vitro planktonic cultures (10, 20 and 30 J/cm 2) and one fluence of 10 J/cm 2 for in vivo studies on G. mellonella larvae and in vitro biofilms studies. With regard to C. albicans cells suspensions, red diode laser used with toluidine blue caused a growth inhibition variable between 79. 31 % and 95. 79 %. The maximum inhibition of growth (100 %) was obtained with the blue diode, at any used fluence, and curcumin. Green diode laser used with erythrosine caused a growth inhibition variable between 9. 20 % and 39. 85 %. Larvae of G. mellonella infected with C. albicans SC 5314 for every performed treatment showed a significant increase in survival in comparison to infected animals inoculated with saline (p< 0. 001). The combination of <b>toluidine</b> blue and <b>red</b> diode laser application led to a prolonged survival compared to dye alone or laser application alone, although the difference in survival was not statistically significant between the 3 groups. A statistically significant difference in survival was found between the group inoculated with curcumin alone compared to the group treated with blue diode laser coupled with curcumin (p= 0. 02) and between the group of larvae irradiated with green diode laser compared to the group treated with laser coupled with erythrosine (p= 0. 03). Treatment performed with red diode laser and toluidine blue did not show any effect on C. albicans biofilm, as was for red diode laser alone and toluidine blue alone. Conversely, good results were found for green diode laser and erythrosine, with the maximal effect obtained with the combination of laser and dye (p= 0. 0068) and a significant result also for laser alone (p= 0. 0131). The association of blue diode laser and curcumin gave the best results in comparison with untreated control (p< 0. 0001), while curcumin alone showed better results than laser alone (p= 0. 0057). In the comparison with the untreated control, the application on C. albicans biofilm of red diode laser with or without toluidine in combination with KP treatment showed a statistically significant result (p< 0. 0001), but the combination of dye and KP defined the same significant result without laser application (p< 0. 0001). For the same comparison, the application of blue diode laser with curcumin in combination with KP treatment showed a statistically significant result (p= 0. 0006), but the combination of dye and KP defined the same significant result without laser application (p= 0. 0001). Blue diode laser and curcumin were more efficient with KP than without KP (p< 0. 0001 vs untreated control) and blue diode laser and KP were more efficient with curcumin than without curcumin (p= 0. 0065 vs untreated control). The application of green diode laser without erythrosine in combination with KP treatment showed a statistically significant result (p= 0. 0002) compared to the untreated control.

Every sample (one per patient) was tested with <b>toluidine</b> <b>red</b> unheated serum test (TRUST), T. pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA), and Treponema pallidum enzyme immunoassay (TP-EIA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The results of syphilis serological testing were interpreted following different algorithms respectively. We directly compared the traditional syphilis screening algorithm with the reverse syphilis screening algorithm in this unique population. The reverse algorithm achieved remarkable higher seroprevalence of syphilis than the traditional algorithm (24. 9 % vs. 14. 2 %, p < 0. 0001). Compared to the reverse algorithm, the traditional algorithm also had a missed serodiagnosis rate of 42. 8 %. The total percentages of agreement and corresponding kappa values of tradition and ECDC algorithm compared with those of reverse algorithm were as follows: 89. 4 %, 0. 668; 99. 8 %, 0. 994. There was a very good strength of agreement between the reverse and the ECDC algorithm. Our results supported the reverse (or ECDC) algorithm in screening of syphilis in HIV-infected populations. In addition, our study demonstrated that screening of HIV-populations using different algorithms may result in a statistically different seroprevalence of syphilis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Syphilis {{has made}} a {{dramatic}} resurgence in China {{during the past two}} decades and become the third most prevalent notifiable infectious disease in China. Female sex workers (FSWs) have become one of key populations for the epidemic. In order to investigate syphilis infection among different tiers of FSWs, a cross-sectional study was conducted in 8 sites in China. Methods Serum specimens (n = 7, 118) were collected to test for syphilis and questionnaire interviews were conducted to obtain socio-demographic and behavioral information among FSWs recruited from different types of venues. FSWs were categorized into three tiers (high-, middle- and low-tier FSWs) based on the venues where they solicited clients. Serum specimens were screened with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for treponemal antibody followed by confirmation with non-treponemal <b>toluidine</b> <b>red</b> unheated serum test (TRUST) for positive ELISA specimens to determine syphilis infection. A logistic regression model was used to determine factors associated with syphilis infection. Results Overall syphilis prevalence was 5. 0 % (95 %CI, 4. 5 - 5. 5 %). Low-tier FSWs had the highest prevalence (9. 7 %; 95 %CI, 8. 3 - 11. 1 %), followed by middle-tier (4. 3 %; 95 %CI, 3. 6 - 5. 0 %, P P Conclusions This multi-site survey showed a high prevalence of syphilis infection among FSWs and substantial disparities in syphilis prevalence by the tier of FSWs. The difference in syphilis prevalence is substantial between different tiers of FSWs, with the highest rate among low-tier FSWs. Thus, current surveillance and intervention activities, which have low coverage in low-tier FSWs in China, should be further examined. </p...|$|E
40|$|Both {{the rapid}} plasma reagin (RPR) 18 -mm circle card {{test and the}} <b>toluidine</b> <b>red</b> {{unheated}} serum test (TRUST) were designed to be more rapid than the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory slide test for the serodiagnosis of syphilis. The RPR card test, although originally designed as the teardrop card test for use with plasma, has received recognition from the Centers for Disease Control as a standard test for syphilis for use with serum samples only. In this study, 132 EDTA plasma-serum pairs were tested in both the RPR card test and TRUST immediately after the blood was drawn and the serum or plasma was separated from the cellular constituents of the blood. The plasma samples were further tested at 24 -h intervals of storage at 25 and 4 degrees C for 72 h. Special {{attention was paid to}} any increase in roughness in nonreactive specimens. The greatest increase in roughness (16. 7 %) was seen with the TRUST after 72 h at 25 degrees C. An additional 174 plasma-serum pairs were tested after 18 h of storage at 25 degrees C. Comparisons {{of the results of the}} 306 serum specimens with their corresponding plasma pairs gave 99. 0 % qualitative agreement for both tests. Quantitative agreement +/- 1 dilution between serum-plasma pairs tested within 18 h was 92. 1 % (35 of 38) for the RPR card test and 94. 1 % (32 of 34) for the TRUST. Our results with plasma from blood drawn with EDTA as the anticoagulant were comparable with results with serum specimens for both tests when plasma specimens were tested within 18 to 24 h...|$|E

Two lots of TRUST antigen were prepared by two laboratories in the Centers for Disease Control. Both laboratories performed the TRUST and VDRL slide test on serum samples from 1, 102 patients attending the DeKalb County, Georgia, Sexually Transmitted Disease Clinic. In addition, one laboratory performed the RPR card test. Reactive sera were quantitated in the three nontreponemal tests and confirmed with the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test. The sensitivity in untreated syphilis for all nontreponemal tests involved was 98. 4 %. The specificity for these tests was 98. 6 %. The qualitative reproducibility among the four lots of TRUST antigen, VDRL slide, and RPR card tests was 98. 2 %. Only 20 sera showed discrepant results. Intralaboratory reproducibility of the two TRUST antigens was 100 % for one laboratory and 99. 6 % for the other. Interlaboratory reproducibility for the four lots of TRUST and the VDRL slide test was 99 %. Quantitative agreement +/- 1 dilution between the TRUST and RPR card test was 92. 3 %, and quantitative agreement +/- 1 dilution for the TRUST and RPR card test versus the VDRL slide test averaged 50 %.

From June 2005 to May 2009, 1208 syphilis patients were chosen for research by the Xiamen Center of Clinical Laboratory in China. Serologic tests were performed with <b>toluidine</b> <b>red</b> unheated serum test (TRUST) and Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA). Then, T pallidum-specific IgM antibody (FP-IgM) was detected with fluorescent trcponemal antibody absorption (FTA-Abs) and TPPA. In this study, patients were divided into the following experimental groups according {{to the results of}} TRUST and TPPA: (1) the SSR group consisted of 411 cases with (+) TRUST and (+) TPPA, and without clinical manifestations after 1 year of recommended syphilis treatment; (2) the serum cure group, which was further subdivided into group A consisting of 25 leases with (-) TRUST and (+) TPPA; (3) group B consisting of 546 cases with (-) TRUST and (+) TPPA; and (4) the blood donor control group which consisted of 100 cases. We demonstrated that a total of 136 cases (33. 09 %) of 411 SSR patients were TP-IgM positive by TPPA, and this percentage was markedly higher than that in serum cure group A (9. 16 %). FTA-Abs analyses revealed similar results. All samples in serum cure group 13 and the control group were TP-IgM negative, which is identical to our previous report. The present study also indicated that the TP-IgM positive rate was not significantly different among patients with different ages, genders, and clinical phases after 1 year of recommended therapy. From the total of 1208 syphilis patients, 289 were randomly selected for TP-DNA detection by fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the positive rate of TP-DNA was 32. 53 %, which was slightly higher than that of FTA-Abs TP-IgM, and no statistically significant difference by chi-square tests, indicating the TP-DNA result is preferably consistent with FTA-Abs and supporting our deduction that TP-IgM {{could be used as a}} serologic marker for the relapse and infection of syphilis.

A new testing method to detect Treponema pallidum IgM (TP-IgM), named colloidal gold immunochromatography assay (GICA), is presented in place of fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-Abs). TP-IgM was detected using GICA developed on syphilis-specific recombinant proteins TPN 17 and TPN 47. The FTA-Abs IgM test was set as the gold standard. A GICA TP-IgM test was performed to detect syphilis in 1208 patients who received recommended therapy for syphilis for more than 1 year at the Xiamen Center of Clinical Laboratory in China from June 2005 to May 2009. One hundred blood donors were set up as control. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio were 98. 21 %, 99. 04 %, 93. 75 %, 99. 73 %, 102. 3, and 0. 018, respectively. Detection on 500 interference specimens indicated that the biological false-positive rate of the GICA test was extremely low and was free from other biological and chemical factors. The patients were divided into the following experimental groups {{based on the results of}} <b>toluidine</b> <b>red</b> unheated serum test (TRUST) and treponemal pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) : (1) the syphilis serofast reaction (SSR) group consisted of 411 cases with (+) TRUST and (+) TPPA, which exhibited no clinical manifestations of syphilis after 1 year of recommended syphilis treatment; (2) the serum cure group, which was further subdivided into group A, a group that consisted of 251 cases with (+) TRUST and (+) TPPA, and (3) group B, a group that consisted of 546 cases with (-) TRUST and (-) TPPA; and (4) the blood donor control group, which consisted of 100 healthy persons with (-) ELISA-TP and (-) TPPA. We used the FTA-Abs method and the GICA method to detect TP-IgM; the positive rate of TP-IgM in 411 SSR patients was 34. 55 % and 36. 01 %, respectively. However, in serum cure group A, the positive rate of TP-IgM was 10. 36 % and 11. 16 %, respectively. The chi(2) test revealed that there is a significant difference in the positive rate between these 2 groups (P < 0. 01). The TP-IgM positive rate in the same group, as detected by the GICA method and the FTA-Abs method, had no significant difference in statistics. However, as detected by the GICA method and the FTA-Abs method, all the samples in serum cure group B and the control group were negative for TP-IgM. The TP-IgM positive result demonstrated that active T. pallidum remained in the bodies of SSR patients. In summary, the characteristics of GICA TP-IgM correspond to that of FTA-Abs TP-IgM; this can be used as a serologic marker for the relapse and infection of syphilis in place of the conventional FTA-Abs IgM test.
