40|$|AbstractThe {{in-house}} prepared mercury meniscus modified solid silver amalgam electrode (m-AgSAE) {{was successfully}} {{applied for the}} detection of organophosphate pesticide <b>tetrachlorvinphos</b> in pH 7 buffer solution. The electrochemical performance of m-AgSAE for the reduction of <b>tetrachlorvinphos</b> was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and square wave voltammetry (SWV), respectively. The surface morphology of solid silver electrode (AgE), as-amalgamated solid silver amalgam electrode (AgSAE), and polished solid silver amalgam electrode (p-AgSAE) was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Among the applied techniques, DPV and SWV analysis showed a remarkable increase in the reduction peak current and provided a simple, fast, and sensitive method for the determination of <b>tetrachlorvinphos.</b> The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to correlate the electrocatalytic activity of AgSAE, p-AgSAE and m-AgSAE with their interfacial charge transport capabilities. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the DPV and SWV responses were linear over the 1 – 9 μM and 10 – 50 μM concentration ranges with a detection limit of 0. 06 μM for DPV and 0. 04 for SWV. The estimation of <b>tetrachlorvinphos</b> in the ground and waste water samples with the proposed method was in good agreement with that of the added amount. The proposed electrochemical method not only extends the application of non-toxic m-AgSAE, but also offers new possibilities for fast and sensitive analysis of <b>tetrachlorvinphos</b> and its structural analogs in environmental samples...|$|E

40|$|The poultry {{industry}} in Arkansas is a large, concentrated, growing industry {{that produces a}} high volume of fecal waste. Most of this waste is surface applied as pasture fertilizer. Pesticides are commonly used in the {{poultry industry}} for fly and litter beetle contro land are often {{a component of the}} surface-applied poultry waste. No information exists in the scientific literature regarding the transport of this pesticide component to nearby water supplies. Our research focused on cyromazine, a feed-through larvicide used to control flies in caged-layer hen houses. <b>Tetrachlorvinphos</b> and carbaryl are also used in poultry waste, but these pesticides have a relatively low solubility in water and rapid decomposition rate. Cyromazine, however, is highly soluble and stable in water. Since it may be readily washed from the pasture by heavy rainfall and may persist in surface and soil water, cyromazine appears to be potentially a much greater long-term threat to water quality than either carbaryl or <b>tetrachlorvinphos.</b> Therefore, the objective of this investigation was to examine the extent of cyromazine loss as a result of land application of caged layer manure. To quantify cyromazine loss from pasture plots treated with caged layer manure,research was conducted at the University of Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station at Fayetteville. Plots of uniform slope were bordered to isolate surface runoff, fitted with runoff collectors, and established in fescue pasture. Suction lysimeters were placed at the 60 cm depth to sample soil water in the unsaturated zone. Caged layer manure was analyzed for cyromazine concentration and applied to the plots at three different rates. Rainfall was applied by simulator at two intensities. Surface runoff and lysimeter samples were measured and analyzed for cyromazine concentration. A solid phase extraction procedure was used to separate the cyromazine from the water samples and analysis was done by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results showed that a heavier manure application increased both the runoff and cyromazine concentration. Higher rainfall intensity also increased total cyromazine loss in the runoff, but provided enough runoff volume to decrease the cyromazine concentration. Soil water from the unsaturated zone was monitored for a year following the manure application, but neither cyromazine nor its metabolite, melamine, were detected...|$|E

40|$|Highly {{reactive}} horses {{may pose}} risks to humans involved in equestrian activities. Among {{the factors that}} may affect horses' reactivity to external stimuli are pesticides used for fly control in equine facilities. The organophosphorus (OP) insecticide <b>tetrachlorvinphos</b> (TCVP) {{is used as a}} feed-through larvicide to prevent completion of the fly larval life cycle in horse manure. TCVP exerts its effect by inhibiting the enzyme cholinesterase (ChE) leading to the accumulation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (AChE) in synapses of the central and peripheral nervous systems. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate alterations of whole-blood ChE levels associated with feeding a commercially available product (Equitrol, Farnam Companies, Inc.) to horses for fly control. A second aim was to report neurological, physiological and behavioural findings in addition to profiles of selected immune markers (IFN-gamma, IL- 12 p 40 and COX- 2) and serum thyroid hormones during and after a 30 -day treatment period of TCVP feeding. The results indicated significant decreases in whole-blood ChE activity and concomitant behavioural alterations, manifested as increased reactivity and decreased controllability in treated horses. No changes were detected in physiological or neurological parameters, immune markers or thyroid hormones in treated (n= 6) or control (n= 4) horses during the course of the study.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of EntomologyAlberto B. BroceLudek ZurekStable flies, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.), are {{a serious}} pest to beef cattle in {{confined}} animal feeding operations (CAFOs) by causing economic {{losses in the}} form of reduced feed intake and feed efficiency, resulting in reduced weight gain. Integration of sanitation, parasitoids, and residual insecticides offers a much-needed reduction of this pest's impact on CAFOs. In the past two decades, stable flies have become the most important pest of pastured cattle. Further impact that stable flies have on cattle is when cattle seek protection from stable flies by standing in water, which results in water pollution with fecal matter, in addition to reduced foraging time. Sites of winter feeding of round hay bales have demonstrated to be important habitats for stable fly development during spring/summer. Cattle feeding on round bales can waste as much as 40 % of the total amount of hay when fed in conventional ring feeders. Hay wastage is largely a function of the type of feeding method and the amount of agonistic behavior of the cattle. Feeding methods range from rolling hay directly onto the ground to the use of various types of feeders. Since traditional control methods utilized in CAFOs against stable flies have not been evaluated in pastures, producers rely heavily on organic insecticides in efforts to control this pest. At this time, there are no effective control methods available for stable fly management on pastured cattle. This research examined different management strategies that could minimize or eliminate stable fly larval habitats by reducing the amount of hay wasted being mixed with manure. In addition, different hay and manure mixtures were compared to characterize the larval habitat at these hay-feeding sites. Finally, the efficacy of boric acid, Metarhizium anisopliae, and <b>tetrachlorvinphos</b> in controlling the development of stable flies in hay substrates was evaluated...|$|E

Methods In 2006, we collected up to two dust samples 5 - 8 days apart from each of 13 urban homes in Oakland, California and 15 farmworker homes in Salinas, California, an agricultural community (54 samples total). We measured 22 insecticides including organophosphates (chlorpyrifos, diazinon, diazinon-oxon, malathion, methidathion, methyl parathion, phorate, and <b>tetrachlorvinphos)</b> and pyrethroids (allethrin-two isomers, bifenthrin, cypermethrin-four isomers, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, imiprothrin, permethrin-two isomers, prallethrin, and sumithrin), one phthalate herbicide (chlorthal-dimethyl), one dicarboximide fungicide (iprodione), and one pesticide synergist (piperonyl butoxide). Results More {{than half of the}} households reported applying pesticides indoors.

40|$|A treated surface {{bioassay}} {{was used}} to detect insecticide resistance to five organophosphorus insecticides (diazinon, chlorfevinphos, chlorpyrifos, dichlofenthion and propetamphos), the synthetic pyrethroid, deltamethrin, and the insect growth regulator, diflubenzuron, in larvae of field strains of Lucilia cuprina, and diazinon in Lucilia sericata from 1990 to 1997. Organophosphate resistance was widespread in both species of blowfly and L. cuprina exhibited side-resistance between diazinon, chlorpyrifos, dichlofenthion and propetamphos but no cross-resistance could be demonstrated with diazinon and deltamethrin, or between diazinon and diflubenzuron. Phenotypic expression of resistance appeared {{to be influenced by}} environmental factors such as season, region, sheep density and year. The relative efficacies of four of the above OPs {{and the extent to which}} the OP resistance status of L. cuprina affected this, was assessed by comparing a susceptible strain of L. cuprina, and a strain known to exhibit OP side-resistance, in a series of in vivo trials. All four treatments provided 19 - 21 weeks protection against susceptible larvae but chlorfenvinphos provided the longest protection (16 - 17 weeks), followed by propetamphos (15 - 16 weeks), dichlofenthion (10 - 13 weeks) and diazinon (9 - 13 weeks), against the resistant strain. Penetration of insect cuticle, non-oxidative and oxidative mechanisms that might contribute to resistance to organophosphate insecticides were examined in larvae and adults from field isolates of L. cuprina. Only non-oxidative mechanisms were considered with respect to L. sericata. The basal mechanism of resistance appeared to be an altered esterase (the E 3 esterase) in L. cuprina and was also suspected to contribute to OP-resistance in L. sericata. Adult and larval strains of L. sericata showed no relationship between level of GST conjugating activity and resistance to diazinon, suggesting that these enzymes do not constitute a mechanism of OP-resistance in this species. Contrasting this was the observation of a strong relationship between the level of GST conjugating activity, with respect to model substrate DCNB, and resistance to diazinon in both adult and larval strains of L. cuprina. This relationship was supported by a study of the OP-conjugating properties of partially purified glutathione S-transferases from resistant L. cuprina larvae. Neither an increase in acetylcholinesterase content nor an insensitive AChE in the central nervous system of larvae of L. cuprina and larvae or adult L. sericata appear to have been selected for in the resistant field strains examined. There did however appear to be a positive correlation between resistance to diazinon and susceptibility of AChE inactivation by <b>tetrachlorvinphos</b> in L. cuprina adults. The significance of this factor was investigated further by multiple regression and it was concluded that this did not have a main effect on resistance in adults. Samples of L. cuprina were further characterised by RAPD-PCR to determine intra-and inter-strain variation. Key features of this analysis were the calculation of phylogenetic similarities in an attempt to better define a 'field strain', the mode of dispersal of the species throughout New Zealand as well as to identify genetic markers of high level insecticide resistance. No markers of resistance were identified but this study emphasised the need to treat each sample as a separate strain as sampling from the same area at different times showed that samples were not identical suggesting there is variable gene flow in and out of areas and populations. Based on biochemical identification of resistance mechanisms, consideration was given to the use of potentiating pairs of insecticides as a method of prolonging the life of some existing OP insecticides. It was shown that prospects for using such pairs is limited due to the widespread OP-resistance observed in L. cuprina. Finally, rather than reiterate discussion of resistance mechanisms, the conclusion of this thesis looks towards applying knowledge of resistance mechanisms effectively within the framework of integrated pest management system (IPM). It discusses areas of weakness in knowledge that need to be addressed and emphasises the need for a susceptibility reservoir if IPM is to succeed at a national level...|$|E
