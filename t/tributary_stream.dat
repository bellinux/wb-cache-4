5|$|Big Run, a <b>tributary</b> <b>stream</b> of the South Branch Potomac River, flows north {{bisecting}} the Wappocomo property, {{bordered by}} dense foliage. Shortly before it enters Wappocomo farm, Big Run flows alongside ledges of gray shale known to contain Chonetes and Camarotoechia fossils. A smaller unnamed stream {{flows through the}} front lawn of the house at Wappocomo before curving northwest toward its confluence with Big Run. Corn is the primary crop produced in Wappocomo's agricultural fields along the South Branch Potomac River, which consist of rich alluvial soils.|$|E
5|$|Stretching {{between the}} Pfullendorf heights {{and the village}} lies a flat, wide plain, marshy in places, ringed with low-lying hills, and creased with a small <b>tributary</b> <b>stream</b> from which the village takes its name. Ostrach itself lies almost at the {{northern}} end of this plain, but slightly south of the Danube itself. By 7March, the first French forces arrived there, and the Austrians arrived a day or so later. Over the following week, additional forces for both sides arrived, and the two armies faced each other across this valley.|$|E

25|$|On July 17, 2009, the Fish and Wildlife Service {{published}} a proposal in the Federal Register {{to remove the}} species {{from the list of}} endangered species stating that the Service now knows that the Utah valvata snail is not limited to areas of cold-water springs or spring outflows; rather, it persists in a variety of aquatic habitats, including cold-water springs, spring creeks and tributaries, the mainstream Snake River and associated <b>tributary</b> <b>stream</b> habitats, and reservoirs influenced by dam operations.

25|$|A {{distributary}}, or a distributary channel, is {{a stream}} that branches off and flows {{away from a}} main stream channel. They are a common feature of river deltas. The phenomenon is known as river bifurcation. The opposite of a distributary is a tributary. Distributaries usually occur as a stream nears a lake or an ocean, but they can occur inland as well, such as on alluvial fans or when a <b>tributary</b> <b>stream</b> bifurcates as it nears its confluence with a larger stream. In some cases, a minor distributary can divert so much water from the main channel that it can become the main route.|$|E
25|$|The Pitmilly Lands lie on {{both sides}} of the Pitmilly Burn, a stream that joins the larger Kenly Water, just before the latter reaches the North Sea between Craig Hartle and Babbet Ness on the east Fife coast. The lands on the east side of the Pitmilly Burn border that sea. In order to define further the Pitmilly Lands as they have been known through the centuries, it is helpful to note that in the early 20th century, before it was broken up, the Pitmilly estate {{consisted}} of the manor house with its grounds, known as Pitmilly House, several farms, a flax mill and a grist mill, both of which may have been ruins then, and a fisherman's bothy. The farms, all of which are identified on the 2008 Ordnance Survey map, are Boghall, Falside, Hillhead, Morton of Pitmilly and Kilduncan. A possible source of confusion is that the Kenly Water has sometimes been known, and shown on maps, as Pitmilly Burn, but it seems clear that the Pitmilly Burn of the Pitmilly Lands is the <b>tributary</b> <b>stream.</b>|$|E
