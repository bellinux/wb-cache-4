5|$|After {{some notable}} successes and some early {{failures}} in the 1920s, <b>the</b> <b>League</b> ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis powers in the 1930s. The credibility of the organization was somewhat weakened {{by the fact that}} the United States never officially joined <b>the</b> <b>League</b> and the Soviet Union joined late and only briefly. Germany withdrew from <b>the</b> <b>League,</b> as did Japan, Italy, Spain, and others. The onset of the Second World War showed that <b>the</b> <b>League</b> had failed its primary purpose, which was to prevent any future world war. <b>The</b> <b>League</b> lasted for 26 years; the United Nations (UN) replaced it after the end of the Second World War and inherited several agencies and organisations founded by <b>the</b> <b>League.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{a season}} with little {{change to the}} make-up of <b>the</b> <b>league,</b> the 2009–10 saw further change. The San Jose Sharks ended their {{association}} with the Chinese team. They pulled out all coaches and players they had sent. The Chinese Ice Hockey Association took over the team and brought in new import players and coaches to replace those lost. The team also changed its name from China Sharks to China Dragon. Midway through the previous season the Seibu Prince Rabbits announced that due to financial difficulties they would withdraw from <b>the</b> <b>league</b> {{at the end of}} the 2008–09 season. They were unable to find a buyer and the team folded. However, another team from Japan joined <b>the</b> <b>league</b> in the off-season. The Tohoku Free Blades were able to hire enough players and imports to join <b>the</b> <b>league</b> in time for the beginning of the season. This again left <b>the</b> <b>league</b> with seven teams. <b>The</b> <b>league</b> left the number of games played at 36, marking the first time that <b>the</b> <b>league</b> didn't adjust the schedule from the previous year. <b>The</b> <b>league</b> also introduced a couple of rules changes. All face-offs will take place on one of the nine face-off dots as well teams will no longer be allowed to change after an icing. Anyang Halla repeated as the regular season champions finishing with 79 points and 23 wins. The team also set the record for the most goals by a team in a 36-game season with 180. Alex Kim and Tim Smith lead the points race. Both finished with 75 points on the season, with Kim taking the goal scoring race with 29 and Smith taking the assists race with 48. <b>The</b> <b>League</b> further reduced the number of teams making the playoffs to only four. As well they brought in referees from outside <b>the</b> <b>league</b> to assist in officiating. The two Korean teams faced each other in one semi-final guaranteeing for the first time that a Korean team would appear in the final. Halla defeated High1 in four games after a loss on home ice. The Cranes similarly defeated the Eagles in four games. The final was a close series, needing all five games and with four of the five games only being decided by a single goal. In the final game, Halla tied the game with 17 seconds remaining and in over-time the team captain, Kim Woo-jae scored to give Halla a victory and mark the first time a non-Japanese team had won the cup. In the play-offs Brock Radunske led with six goals and 13 points overall while Darcy Takeshi Mitani led with 8 assists. Patrik Martinec took regular season MVP honors, and Cho Min-ho, also from Halla, was named Young Guy of the Year.|$|E
