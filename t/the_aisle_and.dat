5|$|In 1184, a great fire at Glastonbury {{destroyed}} the monastic buildings. Reconstruction began almost immediately and the Lady Chapel, {{which includes the}} well, was consecrated in 1186. There is evidence that, in the 12th century, the ruined nave was renovated enough for services while the great new church was being constructed. Parts of the walls of <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> crossing having been completed by 1189, progress then continued more slowly.|$|E
5|$|In this 6-minute short film, he entire kingdom is {{preparing}} for Rapunzel's marriage to Eugene. Several guests are in attendance, including Rapunzel's birth parents, the King and Queen, the pub thugs and the Stabbington Brothers, while their animal friends Pascal, a chameleon, and Maximus, a horse, serve as the Flower boy and ring bearer respectively. Just as a brown-haired Rapunzel, accompanied by her father, completes her journey down the aisle to unite with Eugene, Maximus, who is carrying the wedding rings on a pillow in his mouth, has a reaction to one of Pascal's flower petals and sneezes, expelling the rings down <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> out onto the city streets.|$|E
5|$|They {{meet with}} the Valtian ambassador, Chancellor Alrik (Mickey Cottrell), who is uninterested in the {{marriage}} and wants to pursue trade agreements. With the arrangements made, Picard visits Kamala to say goodbye; she tells him that she has permanently bonded with him instead of Alrik. Kamala explains that he has changed her for the better, and will continue in her duty for her people to marry Alrik. At the wedding ceremony, Picard escorts Kamala down <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> watches as she marries another. After the newlyweds {{have returned to the}} planet, Picard says goodbye to Briam in the transporter room. When asked how he resisted Kamala, the expression on Picard's face reveals how much of a struggle it has been and how much he feels he has lost.|$|E
25|$|For {{customer}} convenience, {{supermarkets and}} retail stores commonly number <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>and</b> have signs indicating both <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> number <b>and</b> <b>the</b> types of products displayed in that aisle.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> north <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> porch {{were added}} in 1856, <b>the</b> south <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> nave in 1870-72 {{and the west}} tower between 1879 and 1880.|$|R

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Beyoncé {{preparing}} herself for her wedding ceremony. She {{is in her}} boudoir wearing a lacy corset and a lingerie combo with garters. As the song begins, Beyoncé looks towards the camera, addressing the viewer while affirming {{the subject of the}} song that she was the best he ever had. The video moves from Beyoncé playing with a tiara, a veil and tulle netting on a bed, to various stages of getting dressed. Between scenes, flash back scenes of Beyoncé in high school are shown. Beyoncé is seen with a high school boyfriend at their senior-prom night on May 16, 1998. As Beyoncé and her boyfriend dance, he becomes interested in another girl, leaving Beyoncé alone on the dance floor. The video then returns to the present, with Beyoncé in her final preparations before her marriage. She is shown wearing a white gown and singing at sunset atop a grassy hill, followed by a scene of her walking down <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> exchanging vows. Her former lover is shown at the prom, deep in thought, with his prom king crown askew on his head. Beyoncé and her new husband are seen celebrating at a happy and well-attended reception. The groom removes the bride's garter with his teeth and they start dancing with their younger family members. The final scene features Beyoncé looking into the camera looking happy and satisfied. She walks off confidently to rejoin her wedding party and new husband, and then the screen fades to black.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} a Falls Count Anywhere match between Randy Savage and Crush. The rules stated that any time a wrestler was pinned, he {{then had to}} make it back inside the ring within sixty seconds or he would lose the match. Savage tried to attack Crush before the bell rang, but Crush {{reversed}} the attack. He used a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker to injure Savage and then dropped Savage across the guard rail to get the first pinfall. While Savage was returning to the ring, Mr. Fuji hit him with the Japanese flag to stall him. Savage made it back to the ring with two seconds remaining, so the match continued. Inside the ring, Crush tried to throw salt in Savage's eyes, but Savage countered by throwing the salt in Crush's eyes. Savage then performed a diving elbow drop and rolled Crush outside of the ring for the pinfall. Fuji helped revive Crush, which allowed Crush to return to the ring before the count had expired. Savage and Crush then brawled down <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> into a room backstage. Savage scored a pinfall and tied Crush's legs to a pulley. Crush was left hanging upside down and could not return to the ring, so Savage was declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} rivalry {{was between}} The Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy. On the September 8, 2006 episode of SmackDown!, Kennedy {{announced that he}} was looking for a new opponent, one that he had never faced before. Long informed Kennedy that he knew a SmackDown! superstar that had never faced Kennedy, The Undertaker. A match was made between the two for No Mercy, in which Kennedy defeated Undertaker by disqualification. At Survivor Series, Kennedy once again defeated Undertaker in a First Blood match. On the December 1 episode of SmackDown!, Undertaker fought Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) in a match where neither wrestler won. During the match, MVP was scripted to attempt escaping from the ring, but Kennedy caught him during the process and tried to throw him back into the ring. MVP instead threw Kennedy in. Undertaker then kicked Kennedy in the face, and Kane attacked MVP at ringside. The following week as Kennedy was in the ring, the hearse, appearing to have nobody in the driver's seat, drove into the arena; suddenly, The Undertaker appeared from the back of the hearse, as Kennedy sprung from the ring. Later that night, Kane defeated Kennedy by disqualification after MVP interfered on Kennedy's behalf. On the December 15 episode of SmackDown!, The Undertaker and Kane teamed together to face Kennedy and MVP in a tag team match, which ended in neither team winning. Kennedy knocked Kane down in <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> jumped into the driver's seat of the hearse that had been at ringside for the match, and threatened to run him over with it however the Undertaker appeared in the passenger side seat scaring Kennedy off.|$|E
5000|$|In 2015, {{the casino}} made further improvements, which {{included}} widening <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>and</b> opening up Louie's Lounge {{to the entire}} casino floor.|$|R
50|$|The {{floor is}} of 4 inch (100mm) boards of crows ash, carpeted in the chancel, along <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>and</b> path linking side porches.|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} medieval. The nave and tower date from 1459 and the chancel from 1498. <b>The</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>and</b> chapels are 1505 and 1513.|$|R
5|$|One of the {{two main}} event matches came next, as Randy Savage defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against the Ultimate Warrior. Although Mr. Perfect had claimed {{that he would be}} in the corner of one of the competitors, he did not come to ringside for the {{beginning}} of the match. Savage and the Warrior traded the advantage back and forth, with Savage performing several clotheslines and punching his opponent and the Ultimate Warrior countering with atomic drops. Savage executed two double axe handles from the top rope, but the Warrior caught him when Savage attempted the move a third time. After the Warrior missed a move and fell outside the ring, Savage jumped from the top rope and performed another double axe handle. Once the wrestlers got back into the ring, Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect walked down <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> stood at ringside. The match continued as normal until Perfect reached into the ring and tripped Savage, who was running to gain momentum for a maneuver. The Ultimate Warrior accidentally threw Savage into referee Earl Hebner. As a result of the ref bump, Hebner was not able to make the three-count when Savage pinned the Warrior after performing a diving elbow drop. Perfect and Flair revived the Ultimate Warrior, only to attack him when he stood up. The Warrior recovered and attempted a running splash, but Flair hit him with a chair. Savage saw the Warrior injured and realized that Flair and Perfect were causing trouble rather than trying to help either man. In retaliation, Savage jumped off the top rope to attack Flair, but Flair hit him in the leg with a chair. Savage was unable {{to get back into the}} ring, so the Ultimate Warrior won the match via countout. Flair and Perfect continued to attack Savage until the Warrior chased them away. Savage and the Ultimate Warrior then hugged and walked backstage together.|$|E
25|$|The 15th-century font is {{octagonal}} with carved sides. Piscina {{are located}} in the south walls at the east end of <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> the east end of the chapel and in the chancel. The screen is partly 16th century with linenfold panelling which also features on the late 19th century pulpit.|$|E
25|$|It {{is alleged}} that the army then urged MPs of a former PPP faction, the Friends of Newin Group, and MPs of the former PPP {{coalition}} partners to cross <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> form a coalition with the Democrat Party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva. After days of negotiations, Abhisit Vejjajiva, leader of the Democrat Party, was voted in {{by a margin of}} 235 in favor, 198 against.|$|E
25|$|The church {{monuments and}} {{memorials}} are divided almost exclusively between {{those of the}} Turnor family of Stoke Rochford in <b>the</b> north <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> chapel, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Chomeley family of Easton in <b>the</b> south <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> chapel.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> north <b>and</b> south <b>aisles,</b> {{are both}} of three bays; both <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> south chapel are {{supported}} by two-stage buttresses between each window.|$|R
50|$|Of the whole, {{what remains}} is {{basically}} the painting from <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> arches separating <b>the</b> nave <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> enough to reveal a rich iconographic programme with ample references {{to the story of}} the Redemption.|$|R
25|$|Internally, {{the nave}} is {{separated}} from the aisle with a 15th-century arcade of three bays of pointed arches with octagonal columns. The tower and chancel arches are 13th century and 14th century respectively. The arches from the chancel to the vestry and chapel and between <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> chapel are all 19th century. The nave has a crown post roof with moulded posts and chamfered tie beams. The chancel roof is boarded and the roof to the chapel is scissor braced.|$|E
25|$|After being dumped by Sandman and Scorpio in ECW, {{she once}} again resurfaced in WCW, first {{appearing}} on the January 22, 1996 episode of WCW Monday Nitro as one of many women who stood in <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> waved as Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage came to the ring. On the February 5 episode of Nitro she turned on Savage during his match with Chris Benoit and rejoined Flair, Arn Anderson, Brian Pillman, and Benoit in the then-current incarnation of the Four Horsemen. Miss Elizabeth also managed the stable.|$|E
25|$|Robert {{returns from}} Switzerland after his colon cancer's gone into remission, right before Christmas. Anna returns from a mission {{around the same}} time. This time, Robert walks his {{daughter}} down <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> Robin asks Anna to be her maid of honor (as opposed to Maxie who had the honors the first time). Patrick asks his brother, Dr. Matt Hunter, to be his best man (in place of Coleman who stood up for him last time). On December 26, the wedding goes off without a hitch. No shootings, no delays, no drama. Just love and romance and happiness.|$|E
50|$|On {{the border}} of <b>the</b> {{northern}} <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> nave are placed paintings Enthroned Madonna and Jesus crowned by two angels from 1270. The fresco of the Crucifixion is on {{the border of}} <b>the</b> southern <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> nave.|$|R
60|$|I {{stood up}} and uttered that {{challenge}} aloud in my madness. My voice echoed mournfully up <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sound of the echo chilled me, yet my purpose gathered strength.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> South <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> Porch {{were added}} in 1871 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> North <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> Church Hall in 1876. The Baptistry and the {{proposed}} Narthex in 1883 were added in 1905 and {{was the last of}} the major building work to take place.|$|R
25|$|Double aisles {{round the}} choir, {{of which there}} are no {{examples}} in England, are found in the cathedrals of Paris, Bourges and Le Mans. The cathedral of Sens (1144–1168) possesses one feature which is almost unique: the coupled columns of the alternate bays of nave and choir and of the apse. These were introduced into the chapel of the Trinity in Canterbury cathedral, probably from the designs of William of Sens, by his successor William the Englishman. The square east end found no favour in France, with Laon, Poitiers, and Dol being the only cathedral examples. Of the triapsal arrangement, which has apses in <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> a central apse, the only example is that of the cathedral of Autun.|$|E
25|$|In section, {{the typical}} aisled church or cathedral has a nave {{with a single}} aisle on either side. The nave and aisles are {{separated}} by an arcade carried on piers or on columns. The roof of <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> the outer walls help to buttress the upper walls and vault of the nave, if present. Above the aisle roof are a row of windows known as the clerestory, which give light to the nave. During the Romanesque period there was a development from this two-stage elevation to a three-stage elevation {{in which there is}} a gallery, known as a triforium, between the arcade and the clerestory. This varies from a simple blind arcade decorating the walls, to a narrow arcaded passage, to a fully developed second story with a row of windows lighting the gallery.|$|E
25|$|The nave is {{probably}} 14th-century and is flanked {{on the south}} side by a late 14th-century aisle with its attached porch of a similar age. The parapets of <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> porch are battlemented. The three aisle windows are cinquefoil-topped and the porch inner doorway is of Bethesden marble. The north wall of the nave contains four three-lighted traceried windows separated by buttresses. The chancel is 13th century with the windows replaced probably in the late 14th century or in the 15th century. The east end is gabled with a tall window of two stacked groups of three cinquefoil-topped lights. Abutting {{the south side of the}} chancel is the south chapel which also dates from the 14th century. Four two-lighted windows alternate with buttresses on the south chapel wall and the east end contains a five-lighted traceried window.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> {{interior}} <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> nave {{are divided}} by seven columns with arcades, made of material from ancient settlements of <b>the</b> area. <b>The</b> <b>aisles</b> {{are covered by}} groin vaults, while the nave has trusses. The columns in the crypt are original.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{ambulatory}} are groin vaulted, {{while the}} nave has trusses. The nave, which is c. 20-m high, {{is divided into}} three sections: the huge arcades, the matronaeum and the chiaropiano (upper floor).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> skillion-roofed <b>aisles</b> {{also have}} raked clear {{finished}} timber boarded ceilings supported by exposed timber trusses. Narrow round arched windows illuminate <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>and</b> {{a set of}} timber doors with fanlight over open to the exterior. Shrines dedicated to Jesus and Mary are located at the southeast ends of <b>the</b> <b>aisles.</b>|$|R
25|$|On {{the south}} side {{there is a small}} stone church built into the Cathedral. This is a {{symbolic}} copy of the Chapel of Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Built between the end of the 13th and the beginning the 14th centuries, it was erected here to mark Svetitskhoveli as the second most sacred place in the world (after the church of Jerusalem), thanks to Christ’s robe. In front of this stone chapel, the most westerly structure aligned with the columns between <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> the nave marks Sidonia’s grave. Remains of the original life-giving pillar are also here. It was built in the 17th century. Scenes of the lives of King Mirian and Queen Nana, and portraits of the first Christian Byzantine Emperor, Constantine I, and his mother Helena, were painted by G. Gulzhavarashvili at that time. Traces of the foundations of the 4th-century church have been found here.|$|E

50|$|In 1886 <b>the</b> south <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> chapel were {{demolished}}, the three-bay arcade between <b>the</b> south <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> nave was rebuilt {{and a new}} nave and chancel {{were built}} in place of <b>the</b> demolished <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> chapel. This became {{the main body of}} the church, leaving the earlier nave and chancel as a north <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> chapel. <b>The</b> reredos paintings are by the Arts and Crafts movement artist Kate Bunce and their beaten metal frames are by her sister Myra Bunce. Lady Jane Lindsay, presumably a relative of the Colonel, designed the glass of the east window.|$|R
50|$|In the 18th century <b>the</b> north <b>and</b> south <b>aisles</b> of St Laurence church were {{demolished}} {{and the two}} arcades blocked up.
