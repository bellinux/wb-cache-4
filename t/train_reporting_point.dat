40|$|Actor {{preparation}} has a {{long history}} of dancing the divide between training and education. Preparing to be an actor undoubtedly involves training the voice and body, and educating the mind. It would be a mistake to automatically assume anyone can do it although in rare cases they can. In part its art and craft is making the technique invisible which of course engenders a sense of effortlessness by a watching audience; giving rise to a false notion that acting is easier than it seems. A juggler, musician, mime artist and magician all face the same when it comes to hiding their technique or their training behind the art or what the audience sees or hears. However training alone will not provide all the answers. In 1975 under the heading ‘The Problem Areas’ in Going on Stage – A Report to the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation on professional training for drama, the report identified the perceived divide between education and <b>training.</b> The <b>report</b> <b>points</b> out that: ‘although a course of study or training is essentially vocational does not automatically place that course in the training rather than the educational field’ (p. 58). In part what the report reminds us is that to be an actor one must be trained as well as educated and the polemic divide might well be erroneous. This sort of education though is not necessarily academic – it might simply be through life experience. Embodied practices in actor training are both a product of training and education. To say that actors should only be trained is illogical. Training is an approach, a discipline, and belief. It offers actors a ‘way in’ and a framework which is known to them. Training offers a systematic way of hiding the actor’s technique so we do not see the acting. This paper advances the notion that actor training is rooted in both vocational training and education models. Whilst investigating this perceived polemic divide, the paper explores the topical concern over whether vocational actor training can be usefully sustained within a university context where traditional emphasis is placed upon educatio...|$|R

50|$|By 1976, the {{replacement}} of the huge number of manual signal boxes with centralised power-signalling coupled with computer-based train control and more modern telecommunications systems meant that it was no longer necessary to display headcodes throughout the railway network. Outside the Southern Region blinds were set to 00 or 0000, and discs/lamps to the former express passenger code. Roller blinds were later blanked or plated over to show two dots and new trains introduced for service outside the Southern Region after this time usually had no <b>train</b> <b>reporting</b> number display equipment. Many trains intended to run over Southern Region lines were designed to display the numeric route-code portion of the <b>train</b> <b>reporting</b> number, which they still display, usually as a dot-matrix display.|$|R
