60|$|Certainly {{there is}} a {{blistering}} and awful reality about a well-arranged unreality. It is quite within the possibilities that two or three nights like that night of mine could drive a man to suicide. He would refuse to examine the figures; they would revolt him so, and {{he could go to}} his death unaware that there was nothing serious about them. I cannot get that night out of my head, it was so vivid, so real, so ghastly. In any other year of these 33 the relief would have been simple: go where you can cut your cloth <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>your</b> income. You can't do that when your wife can't be moved, even from one room to the next.|$|E

"Indeed, I protest, my dear brother Obadiah, it is {{with the}} heartiest regrets in the world that I find myself obliged to confess that I cannot offer you a home with myself and my family. It is not alone that your manners displease me--though, as an elder to a younger, I may say to you that we of these more {{northern}} latitudes do not entertain the same tastes in such particulars as doubtless obtain in the West Indies--but the habits of my household are of such a nature that I could not hope to form them to your liking. I can, however, offer as my advice that you may find lodgings at the Blue Lion Tavern, which doubtless will be of a sort exactly <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>your</b> inclinations. I have made inquiries, and I am sure you will find the very best apartments to be obtained at that excellent hostelry placed at your disposal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} over this matter {{with all the}} {{seriousness}} [...] which befits it. You will never know how great and how [...] fierce the struggle has been. I am feeling an older and a [...] tired man. But now that is all over! I have crossed the [...] Rubicon! The mists have rolled away, {{and the truth is}} very [...] clear indeed to me! I shudder when I think to what misery I [...] might have brought you, if I had yielded to that sweetest [...] and most fascinating impulse of my life, which bade me [...] accept your sacrifice and come to you. Berenice, you are [...] very young yet, and you have woven some new and very [...] beautiful fancies which you have put into a book, and which [...] the world has found amusing! To you alone they have become [...] the essence of your life: they have become by constant [...] contemplation a part of yourself. Out of the greatness of [...] your heart you do not fear to put them into practice! But, [...] dear, you must find a new world <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>your</b> fancies, for the [...] one in which we are forced to dwell, the world which, in [...] theory, finds them delightful, would find another and an [...] uglier world if we should venture upon their embodiment! [...] After all we are creatures of this world, and by this [...] world's laws we shall be judged. The things which are right [...] are right, and the things which are pure are pure. Love is [...] the greatest power in the world, but it cannot alter things [...] which are unalterable.|$|E
60|$|It was {{an endless}} {{amusement}} to me during those long centuries, while I devoted myself {{entirely to the}} task of watching my fauna and flora develop itself, to look out from day to day for any chance arrival by wind or waves, and to follow the course of its subsequent vicissitudes and evolution. In a great many cases, especially at first, the new-comer found no niche ready for it in the established order of things on the islands, and was fain at last, after a hard struggle, to retire for ever from the unequal contest. But often enough, too, he made a gallant fight for it, and, adapting himself rapidly to his new environment, changed his form and habits with surprising facility. For natural selection, I found, is a hard schoolmaster. If you happen <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>your</b> place in the world, you live and thrive, but if you don't happen to fit it, to the wall with you without quarter. Thus sometimes I would see a small canary beetle quickly take to new food and new modes of life on my islands under my very eyes, so that in a century or so I judged him myself worthy of the distinction of a separate species; while in another case, I remember, a south European weevil evolved before long into something so wholly different from his former self that a systematic entomologist would have been forced to enrol him in a distinct genus. I often wish now that I had kept a regular collection of all the intermediate forms, to present as an illustrative series to one of your human museums; but in those days, of course, we none of us imagined anybody but ourselves would ever take an interest in these problems of the development of life, and we let the chance slide till {{it was too late to}} recover it.|$|E
