50|$|The {{division}} between science fiction and fantasy becomes fuzzier than usual {{when dealing with}} stories that explicitly leave the universe we are familiar with, especially when our familiar universe is portrayed as a subset of a multiverse. Picking a genre becomes less a matter of setting, and {{more a matter of}} theme and emphasis; the parts of the story <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> explain and how they are explained. Narnia is clearly a fantasy, and the TV series Sliders is clearly science fiction, but works like the World of Tiers series or Glory Road tend to occupy a much broader middle ground.|$|E

5000|$|Ruth Rabbah is {{specially}} interesting from a cultural-historical {{point of}} view in that it endeavors to throw light on the habits and conditions of the time in which the incidents of the Book of Ruth took place. Thus, interpreting the very first words of the book, [...] "in the days when the judges judged" [...] (Ruth i. 1), as [...] "in the days when the people judged their judges," [...] <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> show that {{there was a time when}} the judges perverted their judgments so that they were held responsible by the people. But when was there such a time, and who were those judges? According to Rab, the judges were Barak and Deborah; according to R. Huna, Deborah, Barak, and Jael; and according to Joshua b. Levi, Ehud and Shamgar. The famine is circumstantially described; it was one of the ten great famines which afflicted the entire world.|$|E

5000|$|A {{proposal}} for the differentiation between concept indexing and subject indexing was given by Bernier (1980). In his opinion subject indexes are different from, and can be contrasted with, indexes to concepts, topics and words. Subjects are what authors are working and reporting on. A document can have the subject of Chromatography {{if this is what}} <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> inform about. Papers using Chromatography as aresearch method or discussing it in a subsection do not have Chromatography as subjects. Indexers can easily drift into indexing concepts and words rather than subjects, but this is not good indexing. Bernier does not, however, differentiate author’s subjects from those of the information seeker. A user may want a document about a subject, which is different from the one intended by its author. From {{the point of view of}} information systems, the subject of a document is related to the questions that the document can answer for the users (cf. the distinction between a content oriented and a request-oriented approach).|$|E
5000|$|... "India - A Culture Decline Or Revival?", a book {{published}} in 2008, critically analyses {{the state of}} affairs in India after the British left in 1947 and examines whether Independence has ushered an era of cultural and social freedom or a cultural decline has set in — a thought-provoking subject. It is often taken for granted that Independence from the British rule also ushered an era of cultural and social freedom in India. <b>The</b> <b>author</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> examine {{if that is true}} or if a cultural decline set in soon after. Based on a verse in the Pancatantra, the book has been divided into six parts: Eka (person), Kula (family), Grama (habitat), Janapada (land), Prithvi (earth) and Atma. Issues of education; conflicts between the classes, regions, jatis, languages and religions; expansion of proselytizers; lack of governance; tensions between the legislators and judiciary; rise of unbridled consumerism; falling standards of democracy; dilemmas created by notions of dharma challenged by Westernized modernity; and the problems of attaining universal harmony, are all put into a perspective under these six categories. While examining the state of affairs the author also suggests a way for the pursuit of happiness through unselfish transcendence.|$|E
