5|$|The Sirex {{woodwasp}} and Amylostereum areolatum have a mutualistic symbiotic relationship. The Sirex woodwasp is, {{together with}} Sirex juvencus and S. nitobei from eastern Asia, {{one of three}} symbionts of the fungus {{that in the first}} instance benefits from its vector function. Additionally, the wasp creates the optimal conditions for the infestation through the fungus by drilling into the underlying wood layers and weakening the host tree.

5|$|Researchers in {{the field}} {{advocate}} a teaching style that incorporates group problem-solving activities and demands higher-level thought. According <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>process,</b> a teacher initially poses a single question {{in a number of}} ways. Next, students discuss the problem with the teacher and amongst themselves, asking questions. In forming these questions, students are actively brainstorming and recalling prior knowledge. At this point, the teacher provides specific conditions of the issue discussed, and students must adapt their prior knowledge, along with that of their peers, to generate a solution. Other curriculum designs tailored to young children such as “” incorporate practices which aim to improve students’ capacity to shift and prolong attention as well as think “outside the box” (i.e. generate creative solutions).|$|E
5|$|The {{separation}} of static and dynamic data to reduce write amplification {{is not a}} simple process for the SSD controller. The process requires the SSD controller to separate the LBAs with data which is constantly changing and requiring rewriting (dynamic data) from the LBAs with data which rarely changes and does not require any rewrites (static data). If the data is mixed in the same blocks, as with almost all systems today, any rewrites will require the SSD controller to garbage collect both the dynamic data (which caused the rewrite initially) and static data (which did not require any rewrite). Any garbage collection of data that would not have otherwise required moving will increase write amplification. Therefore, separating the data will enable static data to stay at rest and if it never gets rewritten it will have the lowest possible write amplification for that data. The drawback <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>process</b> is that somehow the SSD controller must still find a way to wear level the static data because those blocks that never change will not get a chance to be written to their maximum P/E cycles.|$|E

25|$|Plasma {{polymers}} can {{be thought}} of as a type of graft polymers since they are grown off of a substrate. These polymers are known to form nearly uniform surface deposition, which is one of their desirable properties. Polymers formed from this process often cross-link and form branches due to the multiple propagating species present in the plasma. This often leads to very insoluble polymers, which gives an advantage <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>process,</b> since hyperbranched polymers can be deposited directly without solvent.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to damaging effects on brain cells, ischemia and infarction {{can result in}} loss of structural integrity of brain tissue and blood vessels, partly through the release of matrix metalloproteases, which are zinc- and calcium-dependent enzymes that break down collagen, hyaluronic acid, and other elements of connective tissue. Other proteases also contribute <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>process.</b> The loss of vascular structural integrity results in {{a breakdown of the}} protective blood brain barrier that contributes to cerebral edema, which can cause secondary progression of the brain injury.|$|E

25|$|While {{there has}} been a {{tendency}} to focus on the bystander effect in disease due to the possibility of therapeutic avenues there is evidence that there is a more central role in normal development of tissues. Death of some cells and their surrounding matrix may be required for a tissue to reach its final configuration and gap junctions also appear essential <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>process.</b> There are also more complex studies that try and combine our understanding of the simultaneous roles of gap junctions in both wound healing and tissue development.|$|E
25|$|When {{transcription}} {{is arrested}} {{by the presence of}} a lesion in the transcribed strand of a gene, DNA repair proteins are recruited to the stalled RNA polymerase to initiate a process called transcription-coupled repair. Central <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>process</b> is the general transcription factor TFIIH that has ATPase activity. TFIIH causes a conformational change in the polymerase, to expose the transcription bubble trapped inside, in order for the DNA repair enzymes {{to gain access to the}} lesion. Thus, RNA polymerase serves as damage-sensing protein in the cell to target repair enzymes to genes that are being actively transcribed.|$|E
25|$|Centralized {{wastewater}} treatment {{systems can be}} costly and {{use a lot of}} energy. An alternative <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>process</b> is converting waste and wastewater into fertilizer, which avoids these costs and shows other benefits. By collecting human waste at the source and running it to a semi-centralized biogas plant with other biological waste, liquid fertilizer can be produced. This concept was demonstrated by a settlement in Lubeck Germany in the late 1990s. Practices like these provide soil with organic nutrients and create carbon sinks that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, offsetting greenhouse gas emission. Producing artificial fertilizer is also more costly in energy than this process.|$|E

25|$|Plasma {{polymerization}} (or {{glow discharge}} polymerization) uses plasma sources {{to generate a}} gas discharge that provides energy to activate or fragment gaseous or liquid monomer, often containing a vinyl group, in order to initiate polymerization. Polymers formed from this technique are generally highly branched and highly cross-linked, and adhere to solid surfaces well. The biggest advantage <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>process</b> is that polymers can be directly attached to a desired surface while the chains are growing, which reduces steps necessary for other coating processes such as grafting. This is very useful for pinhole-free coatings of 100 picometers to 1 micrometre thickness with solvent insoluble polymers.|$|E
25|$|For {{gasification}} applications, or IGCC, {{the plant}} modifications required {{to add the}} ability to capture CO2 are minimal. The syngas produced by the gasifiers needs to be treated through various processes {{for the removal of}} impurities already in the gas stream, so all that is required to remove CO2 is to add the necessary equipment, an absorber and regenerator, <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>process</b> train. In combustion applications, modifications must be done to the exhaust stack and because of the lower concentrations of CO2 present in the exhaust, much larger volumes of total gas require processing, necessitating larger and more expensive equipment.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{disadvantages}} <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>process,</b> most {{stemming from}} the workpiece being {{in contact with the}} dies for such an extended period of time. The operation is a time-consuming process due to the amount and length of steps. The workpiece will cool faster because the dies are in contact with workpiece; the dies facilitate drastically more heat transfer than the surrounding atmosphere. As the workpiece cools it becomes stronger and less ductile, which may induce cracking if deformation continues. Therefore, heated dies are usually used to reduce heat loss, promote surface flow, and enable the production of finer details and closer tolerances. The workpiece may also need to be reheated.|$|E

25|$|Bacteria may {{secondarily}} colonize the socket, {{and lead}} to further dissolution of the clot. Bacterial breakdown and fibrinolysis are widely accepted as a major contributing factors {{to the loss of}} the clot. Bone tissue is exposed to the oral environment, and a localized inflammatory reaction takes place in the adjacent marrow spaces. This localizes the inflammation to the walls of the socket, which become necrotic. The necrotic bone in the socket walls is slowly separated by osteoclasts and fragmentary sequestra may form. The bones of the jaws seem to have some evolutionary resistance <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>process.</b> When bone is exposed at other sites in the human body, this is a much more serious condition.|$|E
25|$|The people, {{by their}} Constitution, affirmatively posited, defined, and delimited all {{qualifications}} for standing in elections {{for membership in}} the Congress. The states, under the 9th and 10th amendments explicitly retain unto themselves the power to make the laws for the government and regulation of elections for federal offices that are apportioned to them (the states) by the US Constitution. Therefore, the people and the states together have the sole authority for the creation, production, and generation of candidate members of the US Congress through the operation of the laws of the several states and the articles and clauses of the US Constitution. Thus, the Congress itself is become a creation of and subordinate <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>process.</b> Congress's processes and procedures for the management, administration, and discipline of members (once they have taken the oath, been sworn, and entered upon the rolls) are constitutionally subordinate to the sovereignty of the people and the states respectively over the creation of the membership of Congress.|$|E
25|$|The {{driving force}} in {{littoral}} cave development is wave action. Erosion is ongoing anywhere that waves batter rocky coasts, but where sea cliffs contain zones of weakness, rock is removed at a greater rate along these zones. As the sea reaches into the fissures thus formed, they begin to widen and deepen due to the tremendous force exerted within a confined space, not only by direct action of the surf and any rock particles that it bears, but also by compression of air within. Blowholes (partially submerged caves that eject large sprays of sea water as waves retreat and allow rapid re-expansion of air compressed within) attest <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>process.</b> Adding to the hydraulic power of the waves is the abrasive force of suspended sand and rock. Most sea-cave walls are irregular and chunky, reflecting an erosional process where the rock is fractured piece by piece. However, some caves have portions where the walls are rounded and smoothed, typically floored with cobbles, and result from the swirling motion of these cobbles in the surf zone.|$|E
