After the arrival of the first royalty check from Apogee, the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company. When their boss and owner of Softdisk Al Vekovius confronted them on their plans, as well as their use of company resources to develop the game, the team made no secret of their intentions. Vekovius initially proposed a joint venture between the team and Softdisk, which fell apart when the other employees of the firm threatened to quit in response, and after a few weeks of negotiation the team agreed to produce a series of games for Gamer's Edge, one every two months.|$|E
25|$|The series {{revolves}} around four older single women (three widows and one divorcee) sharing {{a house in}} Miami, Florida. The owner {{of the house is}} a widow named Blanche Devereaux (McClanahan), who was joined by fellow widow Rose Nylund (White) and divorc√©e Dorothy Zbornak (Arthur), after they both responded to an ad on <b>the</b> <b>bulletin</b> <b>board</b> of a local grocery store a year {{before the start of the}} series. In the pilot episode, the three were joined by Dorothy's 80-year-old mother, Sophia Petrillo (Getty), after the retirement home where she had been living burned down.|$|E
25|$|As modems reached {{speeds of}} 28.8kbit/s, the {{overhead}} of the TCP/IP protocols {{were no longer}} so egregious and dial-up Internet became increasingly common. By 1995 <b>the</b> <b>bulletin</b> <b>board</b> market was reeling as users abandoned local BBS systems in favour of larger sites and web pages, which could be accessed worldwide for the same cost as accessing a local BBS system. This also made FidoNet less expensive to implement, because inter-net transfers could be delivered over the Internet as well, at little or no marginal cost. But this seriously diluted the entire purpose of the store-and-forward model, which had been built up specifically to address a long-distance problem that no longer existed.|$|E

25|$|The FidoNet system officially {{referred}} only {{to transfer}} of Netmailthe individual private messages between people using bulletin boardsincluding the protocols and standards {{with which to}} support it. A netmail message would contain {{the name of the}} person sending, the name of the intended recipient, and the respective FidoNet addresses of each. The FidoNet system was responsible for routing the message from one system to the other (details below), with <b>the</b> <b>bulletin</b> <b>board</b> software on each end being responsible for ensuring that only the intended recipient could read it. Due to the hobbyist nature of the network, any privacy between sender and recipient was only the result of politeness from the owners of the FidoNet systems involved in the mail's transfer. It was common, however, for system operators to reserve the right to review the content of mail that passed through their system.|$|E

500|$|When an {{interviewer}} in 1988 asked about <b>the</b> <b>Bulletin</b> <b>Board</b> System jargon in his writing, Gibson answered [...] "I'd never {{so much as}} touched a PC when I wrote Neuromancer"; he was familiar, he said, with the science-fiction community, which overlapped with the BBS community. Gibson similarly did not play computer games despite appearing in his stories. He wrote Neuromancer on a 1927 olive-green Hermes portable typewriter, which Gibson described as [...] "the kind of thing Hemingway would have used in the field". By 1988 he used an Apple IIc and AppleWorks to write, with a modem ("I don't really use it for anything"), but until 1996 Gibson {{did not have an}} email address, a lack he explained at the time to have been motivated by a desire to avoid correspondence that would distract him from writing. His first exposure to a website came while writing Idoru when a web developer built one for Gibson. In 2007 he said, [...] "I have a 2005 PowerBook G4, a gig of memory, wireless router. That's it. I'm anything but an early adopter, generally. In fact, I've never really been very interested in computers themselves. I don't watch them; I watch how people behave around them. That's becoming more difficult to do because everything is 'around them'." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first game}} of [...] "Basket Ball" [...] was played in December 1891. In a {{handwritten}} report, Naismith described {{the circumstances of the}} inaugural match; in contrast to modern basketball, the players played nine versus nine, handled a soccer ball, not a basketball, and instead of shooting at two hoops, the goals were a pair of peach baskets: [...] "When Mr. Stubbins brot [...] up the peach baskets to the gym I secured them {{on the inside of the}} railing of the gallery. This was about 10 feet from the floor, one at each end of the gymnasium. I then put the 13 rules on <b>the</b> <b>bulletin</b> <b>board</b> just behind the instructor's platform, secured a soccer ball and awaited the arrival of the class... The class did not show much enthusiasm but followed my lead... I then explained what they had to do to make goals, tossed the ball up between the two center men & tried to keep them somewhat near the rules. Most of the fouls were called for running with the ball, though tackling the man with the ball was not uncommon." [...] In contrast to modern basketball, the original rules did not include what is known today as the dribble. Since the ball could only be moved up the court via a pass early players tossed the ball over their heads as they ran up court. Also following each [...] "goal" [...] a jump ball was taken in the middle of the court. Both practices are obsolete in the rules of modern basketball.|$|E

2500|$|While {{studying}} for her bachelor's degree in elementary education at Indiana University, {{she was a}} member of the Singing Hoosiers.

Returning to Nashville, she signed with the Lea Jane Singers, which marked the beginning of her commercial success.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the {{rehearsal}} period, the New York newspapers {{were filled with}} articles about gang warfare, keeping the show's plot timely. Robbins kept the cast members playing the Sharks and the Jets separate in order to discourage them from socializing {{with each other and}} reminded everyone of the reality of gang violence by posting news stories on <b>the</b> <b>bulletin</b> <b>board</b> backstage. Robbins wanted a gritty realism from his sneaker- and jeans-clad cast. He gave the ensemble more freedom than Broadway dancers had previously been given to interpret their roles, and the dancers were thrilled to be treated like actors instead of just choreographed bodies. As {{the rehearsal}}s wore on, Bernstein fought to keep his score together, as other members of the team called on him to cut out {{more and more of the}} sweeping or complex [...] "operatic" [...] passages. Columbia Records initially declined to record the cast album, saying the score was too depressing and too difficult.|$|E
2500|$|Following his {{departure}} in The Chase Ian Chesterton has been name-checked {{on a number}} of occasions in the series: He was mentioned by Vicki in episode one of The Time Meddler; by the first Doctor in episode four of The Massacre and again by his third incarnation on Spiridon in episode one of [...] "Planet of the Daleks". Ian was also mentioned in episode one of the 1993 Children In Need charity special Dimensions In Time and again in Death of the Doctor, a two part story in the fourth series of The Sarah Jane Adventures. After meeting Jo Grant and the Eleventh Doctor, Sarah Jane Smith reveals that she has researched the lives of some of the Doctor's earth-bound companions and discovered that Ian and Barbara have married each other, become professors, live in Cambridge and are rumoured to have not aged since the 1960s. In the 50th Anniversary Special [...] "The Day of the Doctor", the sign for Coal Hill Secondary School identifies the Chairman of the Governors as I. Chesterton. However, the Doctor's companion Clara Oswald, who was a teacher at Coal Hill School in the same episode, does not notice his photograph and name on <b>the</b> <b>bulletin</b> <b>board</b> in UNIT's Black Archive when pausing over an adjacent photograph of Susan. In the spin-off series Class it was revealed in the episode Brave-ish Heart that the Board of Governors had been removed when the school was refurbished as an Academy.|$|E

60|$|On {{the morning}} when the final results of all the {{examinations}} were to be posted on <b>the</b> <b>bulletin</b> <b>board</b> at Queen's, Anne and Jane {{walked down the street}} together. Jane was smiling and happy; examinations were over and she was comfortably sure she had made a pass at least; further considerations troubled Jane not at all; she had no soaring ambitions and consequently was not affected with the unrest attendant thereon. For we pay a price for everything we get or take in this world; and although ambitions are well worth having, they are not to be cheaply won, but exact their dues of work and self-denial, anxiety and discouragement. Anne was pale and quiet; in ten more minutes she would know who had won the medal and who the Avery. Beyond those ten minutes there did not seem, just then, to be anything worth being called Time.|$|E
6000|$|Customs in tropic seas. At 5 in {{the morning}} they pipe to wash down the decks, and at once the ladies who are {{sleeping}} there turn out and they and their beds go below. Then one after another the men come up from the bath in their pyjamas, and walk the decks {{an hour or two}} with bare legs and bare feet. Coffee and fruit served. The ship cat and her kitten now appear and get about their toilets; next the barber comes and flays us on the breezy deck. Breakfast at 9.30, and the day begins. I do not know how a day could be more reposeful: no motion; a level blue sea; nothing in sight from horizon to horizon; the speed of the ship furnishes a cooling breeze; there is no mail to read and answer; no newspapers to excite you; no telegrams to fret you or fright you--the world is far, far away; it has ceased to exist for you--seemed a fading dream, along in the first days; has dissolved to an unreality now; it is gone from your mind with all its businesses and ambitions, its prosperities and disasters, its exultations and despairs, its joys and griefs and cares and worries. They are no concern of yours any more; they have gone out of your life; they are a storm which has passed and left a deep calm behind. The people group themselves about the decks in their snowy white linen, and read, smoke, sew, play cards, talk, nap, and so on. In other ships the passengers are always ciphering about when they are going to arrive; out in these seas it is rare, very rare, to hear that subject broached. In other ships there is always an eager rush to <b>the</b> <b>bulletin</b> <b>board</b> at noon {{to find out what the}} [...] "run" [...] has been; in these seas the bulletin seems to attract no interest; I have seen no one visit it; in thirteen days I have visited it only once.

Necessarily, the Atlantic custom of betting on the ship's run is not a custom here--nobody ever mentions it.|$|E
