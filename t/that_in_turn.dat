40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{machinability}} of BN Added Steels <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> with several cutting tools. The highest Al content TiAlN coated carbide tool showed smaller flank wear and crater depth {{than those of the}} other TiAlN, TiC, TiN and TiCN coated carbide tools. It shows that these tool wears depend on the affinity between tool surface and adhered layer including AlN. The wear of the alumina ceramic tool <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> BN added steel was smaller than <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> standard steel. However the wears <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> low Al content BN added steel and high Al content carbon steel were almost the same as <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> standard steel.

5|$|Aristotle, {{a student}} of Plato, {{observed}} an occultation of Mars by the Moon in 365 BCE. From this he concluded that Mars must lie further from the Earth than the Moon. He noted that other such occultations of stars and planets had been observed by the Egyptians and Babylonians. Aristotle used this observational {{evidence to support the}} Greek sequencing of the planets. His work De Caelo presented a model of the universe in which the Sun, Moon, and planets circle about the Earth at fixed distances. A more sophisticated version of the geocentric model was developed by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus when he proposed that Mars moved along a circular track called the epicycle <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn,</b> orbited about the Earth along a larger circle called the deferent.|$|E
5|$|Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} is a congenital {{disease in}} which mutations of enzymes that produce steroid hormones {{result in a}} glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction of the negative feedback loop of the HPA axis. In the HPA axis, cortisol (a glucocorticoid) inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH, hormones <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> stimulate corticosteroid synthesis. As cortisol cannot be synthesized, these hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other adrenal steroids instead. The {{most common form of}} congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase is necessary for production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not androgens. Therefore, ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex induces the release of excessive amounts of adrenal androgens, which can lead to the development of ambiguous genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.|$|E

Leicester House became home of a museum of natural curiosities called the Holophusikon in the 1780s.

5|$|The {{cultural}} heritage of Slavonia represents {{a blend of}} social influences through its history, especially {{since the end of}} the 17th century, and the traditional culture. A particular impact was made by Baroque art and architecture of the 18th century, when the cities of Slavonia started developing after the Ottoman wars ended and stability was restored to the area. The period saw great prominence of the nobility, who were awarded estates in Slavonia by the imperial court in return for their service during the wars. They included Prince Eugene of Savoy, the House of Esterházy, the House of Odescalchi, Philipp Karl von Eltz-Kempenich, the House of Prandau-Normann, the House of Pejačević and the House of Janković. <b>That</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> encouraged an influx of contemporary European culture to the region.

5|$|How life {{originated}} from inorganic matter remains an unresolved problem in biology. One prominent {{hypothesis is that}} life {{first appeared in the}} form of short self-replicating RNA polymers. On this view, life may have come into existence when RNA chains first experienced the basic conditions, as conceived by Charles Darwin, for natural selection to operate. These conditions are: heritability, variation of type, and competition for limited resources. The fitness of an early RNA replicator would likely have been a function of adaptive capacities that were intrinsic (i.e., determined by the nucleotide sequence) and the availability of resources. The three primary adaptive capacities could logically have been: (1) the capacity to replicate with moderate fidelity (giving rise to both heritability and variation of type), (2) the capacity to avoid decay, and (3) the capacity to acquire and process resources. These capacities would have been determined initially by the folded configurations (including those configurations with ribozyme activity) of the RNA replicators <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn,</b> would have been encoded in their individual nucleotide sequences.|$|E

Cuba's relations across North America improved under Mexican President Luis Echeverría, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Carter continued criticizing Cuba's human rights abuses, but adopted a respectful approach which gained Castro's attention. Considering Carter well-meaning and sincere, Castro freed certain political prisoners and allowed some Cuban exiles to visit relatives on the island, hoping <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> Carter would abolish the economic embargo and stop CIA support for militant dissidents.
