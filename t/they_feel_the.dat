25|$|While the Florida Department of Transportation {{operates}} and maintains {{most of the}} larger surface roads, even in incorporated areas, municipalities such as the city of Miami occasionally try to assume control over specific roads.

25|$|Employees {{develop and}} {{maintain}} various relationships within organizations. These relationships {{can influence the}} choices employees make about expressing dissent. Employees may feel uncomfortable voicing their dissenting opinions {{in the presence of}} others because <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> best way to preserve relationships is to keep quiet. Homogeneous groups also place pressure on individuals to conform. Since many people fear being embarrassed in front of their peers, they can easily be lulled into consensus (Roberto, 2005).|$|E
25|$|Work {{locus of}} control {{can also be a}} {{contributing}} influence. An individual with an internal {{locus of control}} orientation believes that they have control over their destiny. <b>They</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> only way to bring about a desired outcome is to act. Individuals who see their lives as being controlled by outside forces demonstrate an external locus of control (Robbins, 2005). Kassing's (2001) study demonstrated that employees with an internal locus of control used articulated dissent whereas an employee with an external locus of control preferred to use latent dissent.|$|E

25|$|More {{and more}} {{designers}} have shown inter-seasonal collections between the traditional Autumn/Winter and Spring/Summer seasons. These collections are usually more commercial than the main season collections and help shorten the customer's wait for new season clothes. The inter-seasonal collections are Resort/Cruise (before Spring/Summer) and Pre-Fall (before Autumn/Winter). There is no fixed schedule for these shows {{in any of}} the major fashion capitals but they typically happen three months after the main season shows. Some designers show their inter-seasonal collections outside their home city. For example, Karl Lagerfeld has shown his Resort and Pre-Fall collections for Chanel in cities such as Moscow, Los Angeles, and Monte Carlo instead of Paris. Many designers also put on presentations as opposed to traditional shows during Resort and Pre-Fall either to cut down costs or because <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> clothes can be better understood in this medium.|$|E
25|$|Common {{ostriches}} typically avoid {{humans in}} the wild, since they correctly assess humans as potential predators. If approached, they often run away, but sometimes ostriches {{can be very}} aggressive when threatened, especially if cornered, and may also attack if <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> need to defend their territories or offspring. Similar behaviors are noted in captive or domesticated common ostriches, which retain the same natural instincts and can occasionally respond aggressively to stress. When attacking a person, common ostriches deliver slashing kicks with their powerful feet, armed with long claws, with which they can disembowel or kill {{a person with a}} single blow. In one study of common ostrich attacks, it was estimated that two to three attacks that result in serious injury or death occur each year in the area of Oudtshoorn, South Africa, where a large number of common ostrich farms are set next to both feral and wild common ostrich populations.|$|E

A campaign group, Fitwatch, formed in 2007 that aim to obstruct FITs and conduct sousveillance on the officers. Two {{members of the group}} were arrested at the 2008 Climate Camp on obstruction charges. A similar police surveillance unit, the Video Intelligence Unit is operated by Greater Manchester Police. In June 2010, the Home Office announced it would review the use of FITs during public order policing.|$|E

[...] "Beat Goes On" [...] was certified platinum in Brazil for selling over 100,000 digital downloads. It also charted inside the top-twenty in Finland and on the Canadian Hot 100 chart.

[...] Brunner says poll workers have sometimes cast ballots on machines in their homes. [...] She issued the following directive on the matter: [...] "We want Ohio’s voters {{and the rest of the}} nation to see that we have prepared a transparent process of transporting voting equipment, ballots and supplies. That begins with security practices at boards of elections and polling places, documented chain of custody, and now procedures to make secure voting machine delivery."

500|$|Many of the {{problems}} Maya encounters in her childhood stem from the overt racism of her white neighbors. Although Mamma is relatively wealthy because she owns the general store {{at the heart of}} Stamps' Black community, the white children of their town hassle Maya's family relentlessly. One of these [...] "powhitetrash" [...] girls, for example, reveals her pubic hair to Momma in a humiliating incident. Early in the book, Momma hides Uncle Willie in a vegetable bin to protect him from Ku Klux Klan raiders. Maya has to endure the insult of her name being changed to Mary by a racist employer. A white speaker at her eighth grade graduation ceremony disparages the Black audience by suggesting that they have limited job opportunities. A white dentist refuses to treat Maya's rotting tooth, even when Momma reminds him that she had loaned him money during the Depression. The Black community of Stamps enjoys a moment of racial victory when they listen to the radio broadcast of Joe Louis's championship fight, but generally, <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> heavy weight of racist oppression.|$|E
500|$|Jonne Valtonen, Roger Wanamo, and Masashi Hamauzu {{created the}} {{arrangements}} for the concert. Valtonen and Wanamo had previously worked with Böcker on the concerts in the Symphonic series, and Böcker has stated {{that if they had}} been unavailable for the project he would not have created Final Symphony at all. Hamauzu, in addition to arranging the Final Fantasy X music, was one of the composers of the original pieces he arranged. Uematsu, who composed music for all three games, served as a consultant for the project, though he did not arrange any pieces. When they first began the project, Böcker, Valtonen, and Wanamo took a few months to play through the games, watch playthrough videos, and read reviews and analyses of the games. They did not research other arrangements that have been done of the pieces, as <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> general approach to video game music orchestration is very different from their style. They then got together to propose which tracks would be arranged, and decide which soundtracks worked best as a piano concerto, a symphonic poem, or a symphony. They chose a symphonic poem for VI, a piano concerto for X, and a symphony in three movements for VII. Böcker gave the team direction, and coordinated the arrangers in discussing and deciding which tracks to arrange. During the process of actually creating the arrangements, however, Böcker was not involved; he feels that the arrangers are [...] "masters of their art" [...] and should have the freedom to create what they want. Nevertheless, the arrangers were communicating via e-mail sharing their work in progress with Böcker: [...] "If there are questions, or if they wish to know my opinion, I am there".|$|E
500|$|... "Fly on the Wall" [...] is {{prominently}} an electropop {{song that}} is also composed {{of a number of}} hooks, which yell the song's title, while the instrumentation relies on electric guitars. Unlike other songs on Breakout, [...] "Fly on the Wall" [...] has Cyrus' voice processed to sound different. The song's lyrics taunt [...] "the listener for being on the outside of her inner sanctum". The target of the message has been interpreted differently by contemporary critics – an ex-boyfriend and the media have most commonly been referred to. [...] "Bottom of the Ocean" [...] is a contemporary ballad that contains a sound reflecting influences from minimalist music. The backdrop for the [...] "feel-bad" [...] love song features ocean wave sounds. The track [...] "Wake Up America" [...] has a [...] "cheeky riff-rock backdrop" [...] as its, while its lyrical content concerns environmentalism, where Cyrus mainly pleads for audiences to give the Earth [...] "just a little attention". In the first verse, she [...] "admits that she doesn't know exactly what's up with this global warming but believes there's something we should all do about it". [...] "These Four Walls" [...] is a power ballad accented with country pop elements and twangy vocals and lyrics which speak of an interior narrative. [...] "Simple Song" [...] has [...] "bile" [...] sound and is lyrically about moments in coming of age where a person [...] "can't tell which way is up, which way is down" [...] and <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> need to alienate themselves. In [...] "Goodbye", Cyrus' vocal performance is more [...] "roosty" [...] with a more [...] "natural-sounding accompaniment" [...] while, in the lyrics, she finds her remembering the [...] "simple things ... until [...]" [...] "See You Again" [...] (Rock Mafia Remix) is dance-pop number, fusing sultry vocals with techno beats.
