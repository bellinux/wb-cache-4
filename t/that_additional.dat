5|$|At {{the inauguration}} of its new {{assembly}} line, the 767's order backlog numbered approximately 50, only enough for production to last until 2013. Despite the reduced backlog, Boeing officials expressed optimism <b>that</b> <b>additional</b> orders would be forthcoming. On February 24, 2011, the USAF announced its selection of the KC-767 Advanced Tanker, an upgraded variant of the KC-767, for its KC-X fleet renewal program. The selection followed two rounds of tanker competition between Boeing and Airbus parent EADS, and came eight years after the USAF's original 2003 announcement of its plan to lease KC-767s. The tanker order encompassed 179 aircraft and was expected to sustain 767 production past 2013.|$|E
5|$|Convergent {{evolution}} in humans includes blue eye colour and light skin colour. When humans migrated out of Africa, {{they moved to}} more northern latitudes with less intense sunlight. It was beneficial to them to reduce their skin pigmentation. It appears certain {{that there was some}} lightening of skin colour before European and East Asian lineages diverged, as there are some skin-lightening genetic differences that are common to both groups. However, after the lineages diverged and became genetically isolated, the skin of both groups lightened more, and <b>that</b> <b>additional</b> lightening was due to different genetic changes.|$|E

5|$|On May 23, 1913, a {{grand jury}} convened to hear {{evidence}} for an indictment against Leo Frank {{for the murder of}} Mary Phagan. The prosecutor, Hugh Dorsey, presented only enough information to obtain the indictment, assuring the jury <b>that</b> <b>additional</b> information would be provided during the trial. The next day, May 24, the jury voted for an indictment. Meanwhile, Frank's legal team suggested to the media that Jim Conley was the actual killer, and put pressure on another grand jury to indict him. The jury foreman, on his own authority, convened the jury on July 21; on Dorsey's advice, they decided not to indict Conley.|$|E
5|$|Researchers are {{investigating}} the clinical significance of c-KIT mutations in AML.

In addition to the classic risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes, genetic {{studies have shown that}} a common abnormality in the prothrombin gene (G20210A) increases the risk of cardiovascular events in people with FH. Several studies found that a high level of lipoprotein(a) was an additional risk factor for ischemic heart disease. The risk was also found to be higher in people with a specific genotype of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).|$|E
5|$|The I-35W Mississippi River bridge (officially {{known as}} Bridge 9340) was an eight-lane, steel truss arch bridge that carried Interstate 35W across the Saint Anthony Falls of the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. During the evening rush hour on August 1, 2007, it {{suddenly}} collapsed, killing 13 people and injuring 145. The bridge was Minnesota's third busiest, carrying 140,000 vehicles daily. The NTSB cited a design flaw as the likely {{cause of the}} collapse, noting that a too-thin gusset plate ripped along a line of rivets, and asserted <b>that</b> <b>additional</b> weight on the bridge {{at the time of}} the collapse contributed to the catastrophic failure.|$|E

5|$|A 1985 {{government}} committee, led by State Secretary Per Arne Watle, {{recommended that}} more route be flown by both Braathens SAFE and SAS, and <b>that</b> <b>additional</b> airlines {{be allowed to}} start other routes. On 5 September 1985, Braathens SAFE applied for the route Trondheim – Bodø – Harstad/Narvik – Tromsø and Tromsø–Longyearbyen. SAS had stated that it was fine with them if other airlines started flying international routes they did not, and on 17 October Braathens SAFE also applied for the routes Bergen–Stavanger–Paris, Bergen–Stavanger–Manchester, Oslo–Stavanger–Brussels and Trondheim–Bergen–Newcastle. The applications were rejected and it was agreed upon that SAS would retain all rights to fly internationally between Oslo, Bergen, Stavanger, Gothenburg, Stockholm, Copenhagen and Århus.|$|E

5|$|As a run {{began on}} the Trust Company of America, Morgan worked with Stillman and Baker to {{liquidate}} the company's assets to allow the bank to pay depositors. The bank survived to the close of business, but Morgan knew <b>that</b> <b>additional</b> money {{would be needed to}} keep it solvent through the following day. That night he assembled the presidents of the other trust companies and held them in a meeting until midnight when they agreed to provide loans of $8.25 million to allow the Trust Company of America to stay open the next day. On Thursday morning Cortelyou deposited around $25 million into a number of New York banks. John D. Rockefeller, the wealthiest man in the United States, deposited a further $10 million in Stillman's National City Bank. Rockefeller's massive deposit left the National City Bank with the deepest reserves of any bank in the city. To instill public confidence, Rockefeller phoned Melville Stone, the manager of the Associated Press, and told him that he would pledge half of his wealth to maintain U.S. credit.|$|E
5|$|Authors Lisa R. Baba, Jacqueline M. McGrath, and Jiexin Liu {{examined}} use of vibration {{delivery to}} infants to mitigate pain while doing heel stick procedures in a 2010 {{article for the}} Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing. Their sample size included 20 babies of age 35 weeks or more, and they tracked their subjects' levels of pain on the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale while giving mechanical vibration to alleviate discomfort for a heel stick procedure. Vibration was delivered using the Magic Wand, which they bought through Vibratex. They set the Magic Wand to the highest setting {{and placed it on}} the heel of the infant for five seconds before administering the heel stick procedure. Their results found that oscillation sensations delivered to newborns who had previously had discomfort from neonatal heel pricks were able to deliver some relief. They wrote <b>that</b> <b>additional</b> research was indicated in the form of a randomized clinical trial with a greater sample size of newborns.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{considered}} {{raising the}} five-dollar legal tender limit on trade dollars, but instead {{passed a bill}} that officially demonetized the trade dollar on July 22, 1876; the Secretary of the Treasury was directed by the act to strike no more of the coins than necessary for use in trade. Despite the demonetization of the trade dollar, bullion producers continued to place the coins into the American market, resulting in an estimated seven million coins circulating within the United States, of which more than four million were placed in circulation in 1877. Despite the 1876 act, {{it was not until}} October 15, 1877 that Sherman (now Secretary of the Treasury) finally ordered that the mints not accept orders for trade dollars. On November 5, apparently believing a false report <b>that</b> <b>additional</b> supplies were needed for the Chinese New Year, he rescinded his order, finally ending orders for trade dollars on February 22, 1878.|$|E

5|$|Despite the warlike {{customs of}} the Vikings, {{there was an}} element of fear {{surrounding}} death and what belonged to it. If the deceased was a revenant or draugr, such a sight was frightful and ominous and usually it was interpreted as a sign <b>that</b> <b>additional</b> family members would die. It was first and foremost in times of starvation, when communities were struck {{with a series of}} misfortunes, that rumours about revenants began to flourish. The sagas tell of drastic precautions being taken after a revenant had appeared. The dead person had to die anew; a stake could be put through the corpse, or its head might be cut off in order to stop the deceased from finding its way back to the living.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{regarding}} a potential SANDAG {{purchase of the}} road began in October 2010. On July 29, 2011, SANDAG agreed to purchase the lease of the freeway from South Bay Expressway LLC; even though a study suggested that the agency might have to {{spend millions of dollars}} to maintain and repair parts of the highway. Objections raised to the purchase during the negotiation phase included needing a loan from the federal government of $1.5 million to complete the purchase, and a possible increase in traffic through Lemon Grove. The sale of the franchise rights until the year 2042 was finalized on December 16, 2011, at a price of $341.4 million, and $10.2 million in additional fees, with $254 million from TransNet sales tax revenue, some of it to be repaid with toll revenue. SANDAG claimed at the time that they would reduce the tolls to attract increased use and decrease traffic on I-805, which would mean <b>that</b> <b>additional</b> lanes would not need to be constructed on that route. Despite this, the operator decided to increase tolls instead even with the low demand for using the road; the San Diego Union-Tribune criticized the decision. in mid-2011, it cost $4 to drive the entire toll portion of the road.|$|E
5|$|Five genetic {{types of}} HHT are recognized. Of these, three {{have been linked}} to {{particular}} genes, while the two remaining have currently only been associated with a particular locus. More than 80% of all cases of HHT are due to mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1. A total of over 600 different mutations is known. There {{is likely to be a}} predominance of either type in particular populations, but the data are conflicting. MADH4 mutations, which cause colonic polyposis in addition to HHT, comprise about 2% of disease-causing mutations. Apart from MADH4, it is not clear whether mutations in ENG and ACVRL1 lead to particular symptoms, although some reports suggest that ENG mutations are more likely to cause lung problems while ACVRL1 mutations may cause more liver problems, and pulmonary hypertension may be a particular problem in people with ACVRL1 mutations. People with exactly the same mutations may have different nature and severity of symptoms, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>additional</b> genes or other risk factors may determine the rate at which lesions develop; these have not yet been identified.|$|E
