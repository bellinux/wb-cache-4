5|$|Associate Justice Potter Stewart {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court in <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> <b>in</b> which Chief Justice Earl Warren and Associate Justices Hugo Black, William O. Douglas, and William J. Brennan, Jr. joined. Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined by Associate Justices John M. Harlan II, Charles E. Whittaker, and Tom C. Clark. Harlan also wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Whittaker and Clark.|$|E
5|$|Hazlitt found sheer {{delight in}} A Midsummer Night's Dream, {{especially}} relishing its playfully inventive poetry and quoting at length {{several of his}} favourite passages. He also considers how it exhibits the fine discrimination of character to be found everywhere in Shakespeare. As elsewhere, he crosses the boundaries of plays and enumerates subtle differences between even the fairy characters, in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> an extensive comparison of Puck in this play and Ariel in The Tempest.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Voalavo also {{resembles that of}} Eliurus, with a long facial skeleton, an hourglass-shaped interorbital region (between the eyes), and a smooth interorbital region and braincase, without ridges or shelves. Other shared {{characteristics}} include an essentially featureless bony palate, without many pits and ridges, and a broad mesopterygoid fossa (the opening behind the palate). In other characteristics, Voalavo resembles some but not all species of Eliurus. For example, {{the length of the}} incisive foramina matches the maximum seen in Eliurus species (in <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> <b>in</b> Major's tufted-tailed rat and White-tipped tufted-tailed rat). The back margin of the incisive foramen is rounded in eastern voalavo, but angular in northern voalavo. The two species also differ {{in the shape of the}} suture (dividing line) between the maxillary and palatine bones, which is straight in eastern voalavo, but more curved in northern voalavo. The capsular process, a projection at the back of the mandible (lower jaw) that houses the root of the lower incisor, is indistinct in Voalavo, a feature it shares with Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat, Major's tufted-tailed rat, and Petter's tufted-tailed rat, but not the other species of Eliurus.|$|E

5|$|Initially other {{villages in}} the area, chiefly Mattau, Soulang and Bakloan, also professed their desire {{to live in peace}} with the Dutch. The villages saw that it was in their {{interest}} to maintain good relations with the newcomers, but this belief was weakened by a series of incidents between 1625 and 1629. The earliest of these was a Dutch attack on Chinese pirates in the bay of Wancan, not far from Mattau, in 1625. The pirates were able to drive off the Dutch soldiers, causing the Dutch to lose face among the Formosan villages. Encouraged by this Dutch failure, warriors from Mattau raided Sinkan, believing the Dutch too weak to defend their Formosan friends. At this point, the Dutch returned to Wancan and this time were able to rout the pirates, restoring their reputation. Mattau was then forced by the colonials to return the property stolen from Sinkan and make reparations in the form of two pigs. The peace was short-lived, however, because in November 1626 the villagers of Sinkan attacked Mattau and Bakloan, before going to the Dutch to ask for protection from retribution. Although the Dutch were able to force Sinkan's enemies to back down in <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> <b>in</b> later incidents they proved incapable of fully protecting their Formosan allies.|$|E

25|$|Another {{criticism}} {{is that the}} Western Rite is inherently divisive. Following different liturgical traditions than their neighboring Byzantine Rite Orthodox Christians, those using the Western Rite do not share liturgical unity with them and present an unfamiliar face {{to the majority of}} Orthodox Christians. This sentiment is expressed most famously by Metropolitan Kallistos Ware, who was particularly concerned about the further fragmentation of Orthodoxy in non-Orthodox countries, in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> Britain.|$|E
25|$|Similar work {{replicates}} {{the finding}} that learners are able to learn two sets of statistical representations when an additional cue is present (two different male voices in <b>this</b> <b>case).</b> <b>In</b> their paradigm, the two languages were presented consecutively, rather than interleaved as in Weiss et al.’s paradigm, and participants did learn the first artificial language to {{which they had been}} exposed better than the second, although participants’ performance was above chance for both languages.|$|E

Such changes in gray matter volume {{can be expected to}} link to changes in synapse numbers due to the increased numbers of glial cells and the expanded capillary vascularization needed to support their increased energy consumption.|$|E

25|$|At 29, McQueen got a {{significant}} break when Frank Sinatra removed Sammy Davis, Jr., {{from the film}} Never So Few after Davis supposedly made some mildly negative remarks about Sinatra in a radio interview, and Davis' role went to McQueen. Sinatra saw something special in McQueen and ensured that the young actor got plenty of closeups in a role that earned McQueen favorable reviews. McQueen's character, Bill Ringa, was never more comfortable than when driving at high speed—in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> a jeep—or handling a switchblade or a tommy gun.|$|E
25|$|With {{his fame}} earned from <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> <b>in</b> 1910, Lafferty was elected as a Republican to the United States House of Representatives, {{representing}} Oregon's 2nd congressional district. In 1912, after Oregon was granted another congressional district {{based on the}} 1910 census, {{he was elected to}} represent Oregon's 3rd congressional district, running as both a Republican and a Progressive, allying himself with Progressive Presidential candidate Theodore Roosevelt. Lafferty identified himself as a Progressive Republican for the 63rd United States Congress. While in Congress, Lafferty continued his fight on behalf of his constituents affected by the railroad land issue. He also supported equal suffrage for men and women.|$|E
25|$|In early 2009 the Italian National Olympic Committee matched DNA {{samples taken}} from Valverde during a rest day in Italy of the 2008 Tour de France to plasma seized in the Operación Puerto investigation. At a February 2009 {{appearance}} {{in front of}} the Olympic Committee, Valverde maintained his innocence and questioned the Italians' jurisdiction over <b>this</b> <b>case.</b> <b>In</b> May 2009, the Italian Olympic Committee suspended him from competition in Italy for 2 years, effectively barring him from the 2009 Tour de France, which detoured briefly onto Italian soil. Valverde filed an unsuccessful appeal against the Italian ban with the Court of Arbitration for Sport; in a second hearing on 18–21 March 2010, the UCI and WADA contested the Spanish Cycling Federation's decision not to open a case against Valverde.|$|E
