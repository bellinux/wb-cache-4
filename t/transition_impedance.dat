The spiral antenna and the transformer are designed sepa-rately due to computing demands. New knowledge about current distribution on the spiral antenna and influence of higher numbers of wavelength in circumference is pre-sented. The novel transition between feeding and radiating antenna structure are optimized in the frequency range 1. 2 to 40 GHz.

This method and the stepped waveguide technique {{can be employed}} to accurately compute the electromagnetic wave phenomenon inside the transition region of the horn antenna, {{with or without the}} impedance surfaces, from the feed to the radiating aperture. For moment method solutions of the electric and magnetic current distributions on the radiating aperture and the outer surface of the horn antenna, triangular surface-patch modes are introduced to replace the sinusoidal surface-patch modes as expansion and testing functions to provide a more physical expansion of the current distributions. In the synthesis problem, a numerical optimization process is formulated to minimize the error function between the desired waveguide modes and the modes provided by the horn <b>transition</b> with <b>impedance</b> surfaces. Since the modes generated by the horn <b>transition</b> with <b>impedance</b> surface are computed by analytical techniques, the computational error involved in the synthesis of the antenna pattern is minimum.

40|$|Magnetic {{materials}} {{are widely used}} as radar absorbing materials. However, they are heavy and their performance at microwave frequencies are limited. Coconut shell is a carbon-based material and offers alternative since it is lighter, thus opening the possibility of producing light-weight, broader bandwidth microwave absorbers. Coconut shell-based microwave absorbers are studied in thiswork. Activated carbon powder derived from coconut shells was mixed with Flaxane- 80 to give 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 % and 30 % variation of carbon. The microwave properties of the samples investigated included the real and imaginary parts of the permittivity, and tan 8. The carbon content in the samples was varied to examine the microwave properties in the X-band using the microwave non-destructive testing (MNDT) technique. It {{was found that the}} permittivity (real and imaginary) and tan 8 increased for an increase in the carbon content. The relative permittivity of 30 % carbon sample was found to be the highest with a value of 17. The sample also has the highest tan 8 of 0. 14. The reflection properties of single layer and multi-layer microwave absorbers were studied using CST Microwave Studio simulation and MNDT measurements. For the single layer absorbers, the impact of permittivity, tan 8, thickness and carbon content on the reflection properties were examined. The coconut shells content and thicknesses were varied from 10 % to 30 % and 3. 2 mm to 13. 8 mm respectively. The absorber thickness controlled the resonant frequency whereby increasing the thickness caused the resonant frequency to decrease. Tan 8 influenced the level of reflected power in which the reflection was reduced for a higher tan 8. The permittivity and carbon content were found to control both the resonant frequency and the level of reflected power. For an increase in permittivity and carbon content, the resonant frequency shifted to a lower value. The sample with 7. 5 mm thickness made of 25 % coconut shells showed the best performance with minimum reflection at 10. 25 GHz with - 17. 5 dB reflection loss. For multi-layer absorbers, two, three and four-layer samples were modelled and fabricated. A binomial multi-section transformer was used to provide a smooth <b>transition</b> <b>impedance</b> between the layers. The top layer, which was the nearest layer to the air, utilised the lowest carbon content with the highest impedance while the bottom layer used the highest carbon content with the corresponding lowest impedance. Multi-layer absorbers offer a wider bandwidth compared to single layer absorbers. By adding more layers, the absorber bandwidth was extended and the amount of reflection reduced. All the fourlayer absorbers fabricated in this work showed excellent performance in absorbing microwave signals, exhibiting respectable wideband performance. The four-layer sample with combinations of 0 %, 15 %, 25 % and 30 % carbon shows the best performance with 21 % bandwidth below - 15 dB from 8. 0 GHz to 9. 9 GHz.

40|$|The grid in the {{northern}} part of Sweden is characterized by long radial lines with just a few customers. To secure electricity supply it is necessary to have a redundant feeding alternative. A loop structured grid which is used in the more populated urban area is a poor solution in the rural areas both regarding economy and technology due to the long distances. To feed {{the northern}} grid in Sweden a battery energy storage system (BESS) is therefore a solution that could secure the power delivery. An important aspect to investigate is how the electric power quality changes with the new feeder, but more importantly to secure disconnection of supply at fault occurrence.   This thesis investigates how a battery storage system installed at the end of a mid-voltage line affects the electric power quality and the protection system compared to a reference case which represents the line today. The mid-voltage line is an existing line {{in the northern}} grid and is a good representation of the general northern grid.     The results obtained from this study show that the loop impedance does not necessarily have to deteriorate with the new feeder, which means that the voltage quality in this aspect does not change. This is only true for this particular grid when the impedance contribution from the mid-voltage grid is small and the contribution from the low-voltage grid is large because of long and weak distribution low-voltage lines.     The inverter is the limiting factor for the short circuit currents, and the short circuit power and current decrease with the new feeder. At fault occurrence in the low voltage grid the short circuit current does not affect the fuse blow. However the inverter will disconnect for all fault occurrences in the mid-voltage grid, and for faults with high short circuit power in the low voltage grid. This means that the selectivity will decrease, but the system will have a high security level.   For this particular grid the results show that the transformer can be isolated from the ground. A residual overvoltage relay is enough for disconnection of grounding faults. Directional ground fault protection is not necessary for this line with this particular characteristics. If the sensitivity for the disconnection of grounding faults with high <b>transition</b> <b>impedances</b> is adjusted according to ground fault currents in island operation, the sensitivity then decreases at the event of a fault during normal operations when the battery storage system is charging. The sensitivity might also be tuned according to normal operation, which then results in a higher sensitivity than necessary during island operation. ...|$|R

40|$|The general {{principles}} of optical design {{based on the}} theories of reflection, refraction and diffraction have been rigorously developed and optimized {{over the last three}} centuries. Of increasing importance has been the ability to predict and devise new optical technologies designed for specific functions. A key design feature of many of today’s optical materials is the control of reflection and light transmittance through the medium. A sudden <b>transition</b> or <b>impedance</b> mismatch from one optical medium to another can result in unwanted reflections from the surface plane. Modification of a surface by creation of a gradual change in refractive index over a significant portion of a wavelength range will result in a reduction in reflection. An alternative surface modification to the multi layered stack coating (gradient index coating) is to produce a surface with structures having a period and height shorter than the light wavelength. These structures act like a pseudo-gradient index coating and can be described by the effective medium theory. Bernhard and Miller some forty years ago were the first to observe such structures found on the surface of insects. These were found in the form of hexagonally close packed nanometre sized protrusions on the corneal surface of certain moths.

We shall show that the localized solitonlike structures, i. e., holes, decouple from the steady-state distribution {{and that they are}} simple solutions of the nonlinearized time-independent Vlasov equation. We have derived conditions for stationarity of holes that satisfy the requirement of self-consistency; essentially, the relation between the momentum spread and depth of the holes is given by the Hamiltonian-with the constraint that the phase-space density be high enough to support the solitons. The stationarity conditions have scaling laws similar to the Keil-Schnell criteria except that the charge and momentum spread of the hole replaces that of the beam. (29 refs) ...|$|R

ReRAMs make use of resistance switching in metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structures which are subjected to voltage biasing. Up to now, attention was focused on dc resistance transition. Less {{attention has been paid}} to the impedance variation, i. e. to the influence of voltage biasing on ac conductance and capacitance in ReRAM devices. In a recent work on HfO 2 ReRAMs [1], we demonstrated that the capacitance, and more generally the imaginary part of RRAM devices, can also be switched by external bias. This paves the way for the realization of capacitive switching memories, or memcapacitors. Besides digital memory applications, memcapacitors could also be used in a broad range of electronic applications, such as reconfigurable RF circuits. From the fundamental point of view, impedance studies can provide information about conduction mechanisms and related switching phenomena. This work aims to better understand the mechanisms of ac conductance and capacitance variation in ReRAM devices. Studied devices are HfO 2 MIM structures elaborated by atomic layer deposition. Devices are subjected to a constant dc voltage bias, and the impedance (real and imaginary parts) is recorded as a function of time. This allows us to follow kinetics of impedance switching, i. e. of both the ac conductance and the capacitance transition. Measurements are carried out at different frequencies and at different temperatures. The frequency and temperature dependence of the impedance in the high and low resistive states is discussed along ac conduction and polarization models implying intrinsic and bias-induced defects. Study of the capacitance switching time, as a function of bias, brings further information about the generation rate of defects which control <b>impedance</b> <b>transition...</b>|$|R
