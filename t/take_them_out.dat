In its report The Intercept the author details the flawed methods which are used to locate targets for lethal drone strikes, resulting in the deaths of innocent people.

25|$|The {{player can}} direct Drake to take cover behind corners or low walls using either aimed or blind-fire {{to kill his}} enemies. The player can also have Drake fire while moving. If Drake is undetected by his enemies, the player can attempt to use stealth to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>out,</b> such as by sneaking up behind them and killing them with one hit, or by {{dropping}} down onto an enemy whilst Drake is hanging from a ledge. The stealth mechanic has been simplified and improved. Some areas of the game will require the player to solve puzzles {{with the use of}} Drake's journal, which provides clues towards the puzzles' solutions. When enabled, a hint system provides gameplay clues, such as the direction of the next objective.|$|E

Prince Ali Yusuf gives a fortune in jewels into the safekeeping of Bob Rawlinson, his pilot and the only person he trusts to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the country. Rawlinson conceals the jewels in the luggage of his sister, Mrs Joan Sutcliffe, travelling with her daughter, Jennifer. He is seen doing this by a rather sinister woman via a handheld mirror on her balcony in the next room. Soon after, both Ali Yusuf and Bob Rawlinson are killed in an aeroplane crash after a flight mechanic sabotages their plane. British Intelligence among others get onto the trail of the jewels. Their attention focuses on Meadowbank School, where not only Jennifer, but also the prince's cousin, Shaista, are studying.|$|E

Batting first, Gloucestershire were bowled out for 182 in only 44.1 overs, Matt Windows top-scoring with 57 while Darren Gough and Grant Flower took three wickets each. Malinga Bandara and Martyn Ball shared the highest partnership of the match, adding 59 runs for the ninth wicket to carry Gloucestershire from 118 for 8. Essex then crawled to 49 for 7, James Averis finishing with amazing figures of 8-2-9-2, while Ball and Mark Alleyne also grabbed two wickets each. Despite 46 from New Zealand all-rounder Andre Adams, Essex were all out for 122 when Adams was caught off the bowling of Mark Hardinges.|$|E

25|$|For an Earthbound observer, {{objects in}} the sky {{complete}} one revolution around the Earth in 1 day. Proxima Centauri, which is the nearest star outside the solar system, is about 4 light-years away. On a geostationary view, Proxima Centauri has a speed many times greater than c as the rim speed of an object moving in a circle {{is a product of}} the radius and angular speed. It is also possible on a geostatic view for objects such as comets to vary their speed from subluminal to superluminal and vice versa simply because the distance from the Earth varies. Comets may have orbits which <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> to more than 1000 AU. The circumference of a circle with a radius of 1000 AU is greater than one light day. In other words, a comet at such a distance is superluminal in a geostatic, and therefore non-inertial, frame.|$|E
25|$|Uncharted 2 is an action-adventure {{platform}} {{video game}} played from a third-person view, with the player {{in control of}} Nathan Drake. Drake is physically adept {{and is able to}} jump, climb, and scale narrow ledges and wall-faces to get between points. Drake can be equipped with up to two firearms – one single-handed and one two-handed – and a limited supply of grenades. Drake can pick up weapons, automatically replacing the existing weapon he was using, and additional ammunition from slain enemies. The player can direct Drake to take cover behind corners or low walls using either aimed or blind-fire to kill his enemies. The player can also have Drake fire while moving. If Drake is undetected by his enemies, the player can attempt to use stealth to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>out,</b> such as by sneaking up behind them to knock them out with one hit, or by pulling an unsuspecting foe over a ledge from which Drake is hanging. In most areas, if all of the foes patrolling are killed stealthily then other waves that would normally appear do not. Some areas of the game require the player to solve puzzles with the use of Drake's journal, which provides clues towards the puzzles' solutions. When enabled, a hint system provides gameplay clues, such as the direction of the next objective.|$|E
25|$|Merida and Belle later stumble upon a witch's home, {{where they}} sneak inside {{to use a}} {{cauldron}} to do a locator spell, which conjures up a futuristic vision of a Southern moor where three men are vying for Merida's hand in marriage, followed by her three brothers brought in by their captors who remove the bags off their heads. Unfortunately, the United Clans also plan to kills Merida's brothers and take DunBroch from Merida. Belle tells Merida its time to change fate, so Belle reads the scroll. As Belle watches Merida practices her archery skills, she's just finished up creating the potion, which will turn Merida into a bear so she can save her brothers. Belle is skeptical about using the spell to change fate, but Merida says otherwise. As they reach the United Clans, Merida threatens to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> but as she drinks the potion, Belle told her it wasn't the actual potion, then tells Merida {{that she should have}} faith in her own fate without magic. When the United Clans' archers aim their arrows at her brothers, Merida showed them who was in charge by aiming her arrows at the targets and takes them out. The clans then bow down to Merida to acknowledge her as the Queen of DunBroch. With that out of the way, Merida let Belle return to Camelot to join the others.|$|E

25|$|A {{good example}} that {{highlights}} {{the pros and}} cons of using dynamic arrays vs. linked lists is by implementing a program that resolves the Josephus problem. The Josephus problem is an election method that works by having a group of people stand in a circle. Starting at a predetermined person, you count around the circle n times. Once you reach the nth person, <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the circle and have the members close the circle. Then count around the circle the same n times and repeat the process, until only one person is left. That person wins the election. This shows the strengths and weaknesses of a linked list vs. a dynamic array, because if you view the people as connected nodes in a circular linked list then it shows how easily the linked list is able to delete nodes (as it only has to rearrange the links to the different nodes). However, the linked list will be poor at finding the next person to remove and will need to search through the list until it finds that person. A dynamic array, on the other hand, will be poor at deleting nodes (or elements) as it cannot remove one node without individually shifting all the elements up the list by one. However, it is exceptionally easy to find the nth person in the circle by directly referencing them by their position in the array.|$|E
25|$|Richard and Susan's Mexican nanny, Amelia (Adriana Barraza), {{tends to}} their {{children}}, Debbie (Elle Fanning) and Mike (Nathan Gamble), in their San Diego, California home {{while they are}} in Morocco. When Amelia learns of Susan's injury, she is forced {{to take care of}} the children longer than planned and becomes worried that she will miss her son's wedding. Unable to secure any other help to care for them, she calls Richard for advice, who tells her that she has to stay with the children. Without his permission, Amelia decides to take the children with her to the wedding in a rural community near Tijuana, Mexico. Her nephew Santiago (Gael García Bernal) offers to take her and the kids to the wedding. They cross the border uneventfully and the children are soon confronted by the Mexican culture and street scene. The revelry of the wedding extends well into the evening, and the kids enjoy themselves in the festivities. Rather than staying the night in Mexico with the children, Amelia decides to drive back to the States with Santiago. He has been drinking heavily and the border guards become suspicious of him and the American children in the car. Amelia has passports for all four travelers, but no letter of consent from the children's parents allowing her to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the United States. Intoxicated and worried, Santiago trespasses the border. He soon abandons Amelia and the children in the desert, attempting to lead off the police; his fate after this is unknown.|$|E

500|$|Another {{interesting}} {{recovery method}} conservationists and biologists are using is called Fish Transportation.
