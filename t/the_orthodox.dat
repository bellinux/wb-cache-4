5|$|The last Ottoman census, {{conducted}} in 1908, counted 128,000 Orthodox Christians and 95,000 Muslims in the region. Of <b>the</b> <b>Orthodox</b> population, an estimated 30,000 to 47,000 spoke Greek exclusively. The rest of <b>the</b> <b>Orthodox</b> community spoke an Albanian patois at home, but was literate only in Greek, {{which was used}} in cultural, trading and economic activities. Moreover, they expressed a strong pro-Greek feeling, and {{were the first to}} support the following breakaway autonomist movement. Considering these conditions, loyalty in Northern Epirus to an Albanian government competing in an anarchy, whose leaders were mostly Muslim, could not be guaranteed.|$|E

5|$|In 1631 Wiśniowiecki {{returned}} to the Commonwealth and took over from his uncle the management of his father's huge estate, which included {{a large part of}} what is now Ukraine. In 1632 he converted from Eastern Orthodoxy to Catholicism, an action that caused much concern in Ukraine. His decision has been analyzed by historians, and often criticized, particularly in Ukrainian historiography. <b>The</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Church feared to lose a powerful protector, and Isaiah Kopinsky, metropolitan bishop of Kiev and a friend of his mother, unsuccessfully pleaded with him to change his mind. Jeremi would not budge although he remained on decent terms with <b>the</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Church, avoiding provocative actions, and supported his uncle and Orthodox bishop Peter Mogila and his Orthodox Church collegium.|$|E

Afterwards, Machen led an exodus of conservatives to form what would be later known as <b>the</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Presbyterian Church.|$|E
5|$|In his {{political}} tracts, written {{well after the}} Conservative Party's demise, I. C. Filitti preserves <b>the</b> <b>orthodox</b> conservative principles of Maiorescu.

5|$|Moreover, Hellenic Nomarchy {{points to}} the ongoing {{successful}} struggle of the Serbs against the Ottoman rule, which began in 1804.

5|$|Negotiations with Pelagius {{about the}} status of the Church in the Kingdom of Cyprus {{concluded}} with an agreement in October 1220. One of Alice's demands was for Greek Orthodox priests to be exempt from taxation. She also persuaded the pope, who had ordered the abolition of <b>the</b> <b>Orthodox</b> hierarchy on the island, to permit the appointment of Orthodox suffragan bishops in the four Roman Catholic dioceses. In time, the agreement was revised, as the Cypriot noblemen opposed the payment of a tithe (as prescribed by the agreement). The Holy See had also demanded that the estates the nobles had seized from <b>the</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Church be restored to the Catholic clerics. However, this new agreement, reached in 1222, neither freed the noblemen from the tithe nor prescribed the restoration of Church property.|$|E
