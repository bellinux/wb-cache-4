5|$|Many early researchers, {{both before}} and after the {{periodic}} table was published, were eager to be the first to discover and name the missing element. Its location in the table suggested <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> easier to find than other undiscovered elements.|$|E
5|$|Randolph adopted two {{rules in}} {{preparing}} his initial outline: that the Constitution should only include essential principles, avoiding minor provisions {{that would change}} over time, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> stated in simple and precise language.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{school building}} in Fore Street {{was built in}} 1583 a private residence for William Symes of Poundisford. In 1671 his youngest son, John, conveyed the property to 12 trustees so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> converted into a grammar school - according to his father's wish.|$|E

60|$|Upon this Lady Ball got up {{from her}} chair {{and walked to the}} door. Margaret had been more impetuous and had {{answered}} her with much more confidence than she had expected. She was determined now to say one more word, but so to say <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> answered--to strike one more blow, but so to strike <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> returned.|$|R
5|$|A {{key issue}} facing Kenya was a border dispute in North East Province, {{alongside}} Somalia. Ethnic Somalis inhabited this region and claimed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> part of Somalia, not Kenya. Kenyatta refused to accede to their demands, {{insisting that the}} land remain Kenyan. In June 1962 Kenyatta travelled to Mogadishu {{to discuss the issue}} with the Somalian authorities, but the two sides could not reach an agreement.|$|E
5|$|After the {{calendar}} stories, Hebel wrote Biblische Geschichten (Bible stories), {{a new school}} book for evangelical religious education. His criteria were <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> clearly written and tell biblical stories in an exciting narrative style aimed at children from ten to fourteen. It took five years to write and was completed and released in 1824. It {{was used as a}} textbook until 1855.|$|E
5|$|As a Liberal MP he {{supported}} Irish Home Rule, trade unions, {{free trade and}} welfare reforms. Leading up to the First World War he argued that Britain should adopt a more sympathetic approach towards Germany, including naval disarmament. When war did break out, Brunner was resolute in the opinion <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> fought and won. In addition {{to the production of}} alkali, his factories were making other chemicals for use as explosives. He also built a new factory to purify trinitrotoluene.|$|E

5|$|At the Tehran Conference Winston Churchill {{made his}} famous remark that in wartime 'truth is so {{precious}} {{that she should}} always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.’ Clarke's principle was the opposite. His thesis was that the lie (the cover plan) was so precious <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> flanked with an escort of truths.|$|E
5|$|Cow Tower formed part of {{the city}} defences during the 15th century, with the Crown {{occasionally}} issuing instructions <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> repaired. In 1450 St Giles Hospital formally transferred any rights they had to the tower and the immediately surrounding land to the city. The population of Norwich grew significantly from 1500 onwards and the city continued to maintain the urban defences; like other towers and gatehouses belonging to the city, however, by this period the Cow Tower was probably leased out to a merchant or craftsman when not in military use.|$|E
5|$|In 1995 {{the group}} {{released}} a report, Digital Terrestrial Broadcasting in Australia, containing the preliminary {{conclusions of the}} group. It found that premature regulation of the new platform might stifle the market-driven development of the service, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> based upon existing standards, and should not restrict the ability of broadcasters to tailor local content. It was too early {{at the time to}} make decisions relating to what standard should be used, when transmissions should commence, and whether analog television should be phased out.|$|E

5|$|In various recipes, other substitutions and {{additions}} are suggested. The Hairy Bikers (Dave Myers and Si King) suggest Welsh cheddar as {{an alternative}} to Caerphilly and propose <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> served with a red onion and chilli pepper relish. An Australian recipe suggests Lancashire cheese {{as an alternative}} ingredient. Regarding the breadcrumbs, chef Bobby Freeman suggests using half brown and half white breadcrumbs, while the cookbook for the London-based restaurant Canteen proposes using a combination of boiled potatoes and breadcrumbs for the coating of the sausage.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{maintaining}} the canal for its amenity value began before the canal closed, with the Inland Waterways Association mounting a campaign to retain it when plans to close it were first announced in 1952. They were already formulating plans for {{the revival of the}} Thames and Severn Canal, which depended on the Stroudwater for its link to the River Severn. The National Parks Commission declared <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> retained for its amenity value and beauty in 1954, but it was closed nevertheless.|$|E
5|$|Jack Bros. {{was well}} {{received}} in retrospective reviews, with multiple critics calling {{it one of}} the best Virtual Boy games; some thought it was held back by the platform, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> made available on other platforms, such as the Nintendo 3DS. In 2003, the staff at Tips & Tricks stated it to be the most uncommon North American Virtual Boy release, giving it a rarity rating of 6/10 based on a consultation with Digital Press.|$|E

5|$|Montagu {{outlined}} three {{criteria for}} the document that contained {{the details of the}} falsified plans to land in the Balkans. He said that the target should be casually but clearly identified, that it should name Sicily and another location as cover, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> in an unofficial correspondence that would not normally be sent by diplomatic courier, or encoded signal.|$|E
5|$|The Clevedon Pier Preservation Society {{was formed}} in 1972 and started campaigning for the {{restoration}} of the pier. The district council applied for permission to demolish the pier in 1979, but a public enquiry the following year ruled <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> retained. The pavilions {{from the end of the}} pier were taken ashore in 1982 for storage in anticipation of eventual restoration; insufficient funds were available to complete restoration and the first stage was to open the Toll House as an exhibition centre in 1984.|$|E
5|$|The French Resistance in Paris rose {{against the}} Germans on 19 August. Eisenhower {{initially}} wanted {{to bypass the}} city to pursue other targets, but amid reports that the citizens were going hungry and Hitler's stated intention to destroy it, de Gaulle insisted <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> taken immediately. French forces of the 2nd Armoured Division under General Philippe Leclerc arrived from the west on 24 August, while the U.S. 4th Infantry Division pressed up from the south. Scattered fighting continued throughout the night, and by the morning of 25 August Paris was liberated.|$|E

5|$|The Lakshmana Temple of Khajuraho is {{dedicated}} to Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Though three-faced, an inscription in the temple suggests <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> considered four-faced. It also records a legend where Kapila and other demons conjoined together in a single form and were blessed by Brahma that only someone in the same form could slay them so Vishnu {{took the form of}} Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. The presence of the Lakshamana Temple in Khajuraho suggests worship in the Chandela kingdom in the 10th century.|$|E
5|$|The Minor Planet Center classifies the trans-Neptunian object 90377 Sedna as a scattered-disc object. Its {{discoverer}} Michael E. Brown {{has suggested}} instead <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> considered an inner Oort-cloud object {{rather than a}} member of the scattered disc, because, with a perihelion distance of 76 AU, it is too remote to be affected by the gravitational attraction of the outer planets.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of livestock}} {{was driven by}} the need to have food on hand when hunting was unproductive. The desirable characteristics of a domestic animal are <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> useful to man, should be able to thrive in his company, should breed freely and be easy to tend. Domestication was not a single event, but a process repeated at various periods in different places. Sheep and goats were the animals that accompanied the nomads in the Middle East, while cattle and pigs were associated with more settled communities.|$|E
