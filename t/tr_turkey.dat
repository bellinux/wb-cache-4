40|$|In this paper, I {{consider}} two heterogeneous economies {{that engage}} in a currency union. The small economy adopts the currency of the large and is highly dependent on its wealthier partner for trade. The effects of a currency union, deficit financing and institutional restraints on inflation are analyzed in a dual economy with different wage-setting mechanisms. In the model, Northern Cyprus is the small economy and Turkey, being the only country that acknowledges it as an independent state is its larger partner. Features of the labour markets determine the wages. We make a conjecture that wage determination in Northern Cyprus (NC) is conducted with reference to centralized-bargaining and that decentralized bargaining sets the wages in <b>Turkey</b> (<b>TR).</b> Hence, the differences in wage-setting procedures cause a dual labour market. In order to incorporate monetary dependence into the analysis, we let the Turkish central bank {{to decide on the}} economic policy measures, in this case the inflation rate and unemployment. The institutional restraints such as economic sanctions increase the inflexibility in the NC and cause shocks to affect the economy more. In order to compensate for the losses that might be endured by the government in NC, TR finances the budget deficit of NC. Therefore, TR government needs to consider the burden of this financing issue. ...|$|R
40|$|Open {{markets are}} an {{integral}} part of urban areas that provide a means for intense sharing of knowledge and practices about plants among people from different social groups and different cultural and geographical origins. This study focuses on the diversity of wild plants found in open markets in urban areas on both sides of the Bulgarian-Turkish border, sold as food and plants for prevention, treatment and healing. Information was collected from open markets by free-listed observations and semi-structured interviews in border regions of Southern and South-eastern Bulgaria (Bg) and North-western <b>Turkey</b> (<b>Tr).</b> The present investigation was carried out through 2011 - 2013. A total of 41 wild plants belonging to 20 families were documented. In this study, two main groups of wild plants were outlined: medicinal and edible, sold mostly as fresh fruits, dry fruits, fresh aerial parts, preserved foods and mono-component herbal teas. The specific use of plants in the border sub-regions can be outlined as follows: as edible greens (Tr), as edible fruits (Bg), as ready-prepared herbal mixtures (Bg), as fresh herbs (Tr). Urtica urens (Tr) is a culturally distinctive plant as well as use of edible greens mixture (Tr) and use of the wild fruits for healthy and traditional food (Tr). Approximately 17 % of the plants were common and widely reported on both sides of the border: such as Urtica dioica, Rumex patientia, Rumex acetosella, Cotinus coggygria, Hypericum perforatum, Sideritis scardica (endemic), Rosa canina and Tilia spp...|$|R
40|$|The green  economy  is  often  {{defined as}} an {{economic}} configu ration  that  results  in  improved  human  well - being  and  social  equity,  while  reducing   (or  at  least  decoupling  from)    environmental  risks.   It  is  elusive,   and  can  be  read  as  a  new  way  of  ensuring  and  maintaining  capital  accumulation  accompanied  by   neoliberal  austerity  policies,  where   a  green  rationale  is  required  to  maintain  the  structural  roots  of  the   global political economy. As such, critics  often  identify  its  self -contradictory nature, in  giving  legitimacy  and coherence to a number of  public  policies.   This article  critically  examines  the  post- politicisation of  the  green economy, by  tracing its social construction and meaning -making.   In doing  so,  it follows the  green  economy  debate  in  the   post -politicization  of  the  environment  in  Turkey,  a  rapidly  developing  country   with  significant  socio -ecological  challenges.   Th e  analysis  suggests  that  the  green  economy  will  become   more important at <b>Turkey</b> <b>tr</b> ies to meet  international environmental  agreements.   Th e article sheds light on  its  preparatory  report  for   the  Rio+ 20    Summit,   titled  Turkey' s  sustainable  development  report:  claiming   the  futu re 2012.   We  find  that  the  green economy serves as a useful discursive tool to legitimize a  state - facilitated, market -driven,  full -frontal assault on ecosystems in Turkey, particularly in  the energy sector.   We  argue  that  a   clear  rejection  of  such  framings   and  the  development   of  alternatives  to  post - politicization,  are  the two key challenges  facing  the environmental movement in the country.
