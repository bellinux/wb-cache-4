5|$|Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann, later President of the World Zionist Organisation, {{moved from}} Switzerland to the UK in 1904 and met Arthur Balfour – {{who had just}} {{launched}} his 1905–1906 election campaign after resigning as Prime Minister – in a session arranged by Charles Dreyfus, his Jewish constituency representative. Earlier that year, Balfour had successfully driven the Aliens Act through Parliament with impassioned speeches regarding the need to restrict the wave of immigration into Britain from Jews fleeing the Russian Empire. During this meeting, he asked what Weizmann's objections {{had been to the}} 1903 Uganda Scheme that Herzl had supported to provide a portion of British East Africa to the Jewish people as a homeland. The scheme, which had been proposed to Herzl by Joseph Chamberlain, Colonial Secretary in Balfour's Cabinet, following his trip to East Africa earlier in the year, had been subsequently voted down following Herzl's death by the Seventh Zionist Congress in 1905 after two years of heated debate in the Zionist Organization. Weizmann responded that he believed the English are to London as <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> to Jerusalem.|$|E

25|$|The Samaritans are {{an ancient}} {{northern}} population of historic Israel, {{where they are}} historically well identified {{since at least the}} 4th century BC. They define themselves as the descendants of tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh (named after the two sons of Joseph) living in the Kingdom of Israel before its destruction in 722 BC. For them, <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> the descendants of the Israelites from ancient southern kingdom of Judah (and Jerusalem).|$|E
5000|$|Klages is an {{important}} anti-semitic thinker. He reportedly said, [...] "To <b>the</b> <b>Jew,</b> everything human <b>is</b> a sham. One might even say that the Jewish face is nothing but a mask. <b>The</b> <b>Jew</b> <b>is</b> not a liar: he is the lie itself. From this vantage point, {{we can say that}} <b>the</b> <b>Jew</b> <b>is</b> not a man. … He lives the pseudo-life of a ghoul whose fortunes are linked to Yahweh-Moloch. He employs deception as the weapon with which he will exterminate mankind. <b>The</b> <b>Jew</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> very incarnation of the unearthly power of destruction." ...|$|R
2500|$|Historian Frances Donaldson says, [...] "If Belloc's feeling against <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>was</b> instinctive {{and under}} some control, Chesterton's {{was open and}} vicious, and he shared with Belloc the {{peculiarity}} that <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> never far from his thoughts." ...|$|R
50|$|According to the 1939 census, 102 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> {{living in}} Dukhovshchina. <b>The</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> {{forced to work}} after the German invasion. <b>The</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> {{gathered}} in a ghetto, which was liquidated {{in the summer of}} 1942. During this time, 300 Jews perished in mass executions perpetrated by an Einsatzgruppen.|$|R
25|$|The {{city was}} also once home to Burmese, Filipino, Sinhalese, Japanese, Sumatran, Arab, Armenian and Persian communities. A small but commercially {{significant}} community of German merchants existed in George Town as well, as did a Jewish enclave. Even {{though most of}} these other communities, including <b>the</b> <b>Jews,</b> <b>are</b> no longer extant, they lent their legacy to numerous street and place names such as the Dhammikarama Temple, Burmah Road, Armenian Street, Jewish Cemetery and Gottlieb Road.|$|E
25|$|The {{main idea}} of racial antisemitism, as {{presented}} by racial theorists such as Joseph Arthur de Gobineau, is that <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> a distinct and inferior race {{compared to the}} European nations. The emphasis was on the non-European origin {{and culture of the}} Jews, meaning they were beyond redemption even if they converted to Christianity. This modern antisemitism emphasized hatred of the Jews as a race and not only the Jewish religion.|$|E
25|$|The exile of Edom {{began with}} Rome, whose culture lacked any clearly defined philosophy. Rather, it adopted the philosophies {{of all the}} {{preceding}} cultures, causing Roman culture {{to be in a}} constant flux. Although the Roman Empire has fallen, <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> still in the exile of Edom, and indeed, one can find this phenomenon of ever-changing trends dominating modern western society. The Romans and the various nations who inherited their rule (e.g., the Holy Roman Empire, the Europeans, the Americans) are lopsided towards Malchut, sovereignty, the lowest Sefirah, which can be received from any of the others, and can act as a medium for them.|$|E
50|$|King Rudolph I of Habsburg quarrelled {{with the}} archbishops through the {{manipulations}} of Abbot Henry of Admont, {{and after his}} death the archbishops and the Habsburgs made peace in 1297. The people and archbishops of Salzburgs remained loyal to the Habsburgs in their struggles against the Wittelsbachs. When the Black Death reached Salzburg in 1347, <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> accused of poisoning the wells and suffered severe persecution. <b>The</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> expelled from Salzburg in 1404. Later, <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> allowed to return but were forced to wear pointed hats.|$|R
50|$|According to both Hippolytus and Irenaeus, the Basilidians {{denied that}} the God of <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> supreme God. According to Hippolytus, the God of <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Archon of the Hebdomad, which was {{inferior}} to the Great Archon, the Holy Spirit, the seed-mass (threefold sonship), and the not-being God.|$|R
5000|$|The SS {{execution}} squad and <b>the</b> <b>Jew</b> <b>are</b> one of <b>the</b> {{many examples}} of dark humour in Sturmtruppen: the SS must [...] "exterminate" [...] <b>the</b> <b>Jew,</b> but they <b>are</b> so bad at shooting that they always miss; the SS commander blames <b>the</b> <b>Jew</b> for moving.

25|$|Under proper guidance, in {{the course}} of the final {{solution}} <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> to be allocated for appropriate labor in the East. Able-bodied Jews, separated according to sex, will be taken in large work columns to these areas for work on roads, {{in the course}} of which action doubtless a large portion will be eliminated by natural causes. The possible final remnant will, since it will undoubtedly consist of the most resistant portion, have to be treated accordingly, because it is the product of natural selection and would, if released, act as the seed of a new Jewish revival (see the experience of history.)... The evacuated Jews will first be sent, group by group, to so-called transit ghettos, from which they will be transported to the East.|$|E
25|$|Acts and the Gospel of Luke make up {{a two-part}} work, Luke–Acts, by the same {{anonymous}} author, usually dated to around 80–90 AD. The first part, the Gospel of Luke, tells how God fulfilled his plan for the world's salvation through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, the promised Messiah. Acts continues the story of Christianity in the 1st century, beginning with Jesus's Ascension to Heaven. The early chapters, set in Jerusalem, describe the Day of Pentecost (the coming of the Holy Spirit) {{and the growth of}} the church in Jerusalem. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> receptive to the Christian message, but soon they turn against the followers of Jesus. Rejected by the Jews, under the guidance of the Apostle Peter the message is taken to the Gentiles. The later chapters tell of Paul's conversion, his mission in Asia Minor and the Aegean, and finally his imprisonment in Rome, where, as the book ends, he awaits trial.|$|E
500|$|He stated, [...] "I {{will never}} accept any {{proposals}} that will obligate the Jewish {{people to leave}} France, because to me <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> the same as any other citizen in our country. It takes weakness to chase {{them out of the}} country, but it takes strength to assimilate them". He was seen as so favourable to the Jews that the Russian Orthodox Church formally condemned him as [...] "Antichrist and the Enemy of God".|$|E

2500|$|While King Edward {{had ordered}} <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> to leave England in 1290. Philip, the Iron King, {{expelled}} <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> from France in July of 1306. With <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> gone, Philip appointed royal guardians {{to collect the}} loans made by <b>the</b> <b>Jews,</b> and <b>the</b> money <b>was</b> passed to the Crown. The scheme did not work well. <b>The</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> regarded as honest, good businessmen who satisfied their customers, while the king's collectors were universally unpopular. Finally, in 1315, because of the [...] "clamour of <b>the</b> people", <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> invited back with an offer of 12 years of guaranteed residence, free from government interference. In 1322, <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> expelled again by the King's successor, who did not honour his commitment.|$|R

500|$|... "In the Koran (ix. 30) <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> {{charged with}} {{worshiping}} Ezra ("'Uzair") {{as the son}} of God—a malevolent metaphor for the great respect which was paid by the Jews to the memory of Ezra as the restorer of the Law, and from which the Ezra legends of apocryphal literature (II Esd. xxxiv. 37-49) originated (as to how they developed in Mohammedan legends see Damiri, [...] "Ḥayat al-Ḥayawan," [...] i. 304-305). It is hard to bring into harmony with this the fact, related by Jacob Saphir ("Eben Sappir," [...] i. 99), that the Jews of South Arabia have a pronounced aversion for the memory of Ezra, and even exclude his name from their category of proper names." ...|$|E
500|$|Though she {{eventually}} gave {{up trying to}} convert her non-Catholic subjects to Roman Catholicism, Maria Theresa regarded both the Jews and Protestants as dangerous to the state and actively tried to suppress them. The empress was probably the most anti-Semitic monarch of her time, having inherited the traditional prejudices of her ancestors and acquired new ones. This was a product of deep religious devotion and was not kept secret in her time. In 1777, she wrote of the Jews: [...] "I know of no greater plague than this race, which on account of its deceit, usury and avarice is driving my subjects into beggary. Therefore as far as possible, <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> to be kept away and avoided." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Mike Russell, {{then the}} Scottish Government Minister for Culture and External Affairs, called {{on him to}} apologise for his {{declaration}} on the programme that Scotland, Ireland and Wales are [...] "feeble little countries". Starkey responded {{that it had been}} a joke regarding the lack of necessity for the English to outwardly celebrate their nationalism, approvingly quoting H. G. Wells's observation that [...] "the English are the only nation without national dress". He described Alex Salmond, then Scottish First Minister, as a [...] "Caledonian Hitler" [...] who thinks that [...] "the English, like <b>the</b> <b>Jews,</b> <b>are</b> everywhere".

500|$|Bach {{incorporated}} {{two short}} interpolations from the Gospel of Matthew (in Version I, one from Matthew {{and one from}} the Gospel of Mark), [...] after John 18:27, describing the weeping of Peter, and [...] after John 19:30, describing the tearing of the temple curtain (in Version I, this was replaced by [...] ). The narrator is the Evangelist, a tenor.

500|$|Scholars have debated Calvin's {{view of the}} Jews and Judaism. Some {{have argued}} that Calvin was the least anti-semitic among all the major reformers of his time, {{especially}} in comparison to Martin Luther. Others have argued that Calvin was firmly within the anti-semitic camp. Scholars {{agree that it is}} important to distinguish between Calvin's views toward the biblical Jews and his attitude toward contemporary Jews. In his theology, Calvin does not differentiate between God's covenant with Israel and the New Covenant. He stated, [...] "all the children of the promise, reborn of God, who have obeyed the commands by faith working through love, have belonged to the New Covenant since the world began." [...] Nevertheless, he was a covenant theologian and argued that <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> a rejected people who must embrace Jesus to re-enter the covenant.|$|E
500|$|Brundage {{believed}} that the boycott controversy could be used effectively for fundraising, writing, [...] "the fact that <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> against us will arouse interest among {{thousands of people who}} have never subscribed before, if they are properly approached." [...] In March 1936, he wrote to advertising mogul Albert Lasker, a Jew, complaining that [...] "a large number of misguided Jews still persist in attempting to hamper the activities of the American Olympic Committee. The result, of course, is increased support from the one hundred and twenty million non-Jews in the United States, for this is a patriotic enterprise." [...] In a letter which David Large, in his book on the 1936 Games, terms [...] "heavy-handed", Brundage suggested that by helping to finance American participation in the Olympic Games, Jews could decrease anti-Semitism in the US. However, [...] "Lasker, to his credit, refused to be blackmailed," [...] writing to Brundage that [...] "You gratuitously insult not only Jews but the millions of patriotic Christians in America, for whom you venture to speak without warrant, and whom you so tragically misrepresent in your letter." ...|$|E

500|$|Tyndall was antisemitic. From earlier fascists like Chesterton, he had {{inherited}} {{a belief that}} there was a global conspiracy of Jews bent on world domination, opining that the Protocols of the Elders of Zion was genuine evidence for this. He believed that Jews were responsible for both communism and international finance capitalism, using both to their own ends, and that they were responsible for undermining the British Empire and the British race. Tyndall also believed that both democratic government and immigration into Europe were parts of a Jewish conspiracy to weaken other races. He had expressed the view that [...] "if Britain were to become Jew-clean she would have no nigger neighbours to worry about... It is the Jews who are our misfortune: T-h-e J-e-w-s. Do you hear me? THE JEWS?" [...] Another of his comments, made in 1963, was that [...] "Jewry is a world pest wherever it is found in the world today. <b>The</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> more clever and more financially powerful than other people and have to be eradicated before they destroy the Aryan peoples".|$|E

[...] Members of the US House of Representatives {{sent a letter to the}} Belarusian ambassador to the US, Mikhail Khvostov, addressing Lukashenko's comments with a strong request to retract them, and the comments also caused a negative reaction from Israel. Consequently, Pavel Yakubovich, editor of Belarus Today, was sent to Israel, and in a meeting with the Israel Foreign Ministry said that Lukashenko's comment was [...] "a mistake that was said jokingly, and does not represent his positions regarding the Jewish people" [...] and that he was [...] "anything but anti-Semitic," [...] and had been [...] "insulted by the mere accusation." [...] The Belarusian Ambassador to Israel, Igor Leshchenya, stated that the president had a [...] "kind attitude toward the Jewish people", and Sergei Rychenko, the press secretary at the Belarusian Embassy in Tel Aviv, said parts of Lukashenko's comments had been mistranslated.|$|E
