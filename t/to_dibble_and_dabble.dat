A lot of anthems. In this particular album, I got a lot of features. Usually, I tend <b>to</b> <b>dibble</b> <b>and</b> <b>dabble</b> with features with the people I like. It’s people I listen to that I have genuine interest in. I don’t just do songs with just anyone unless it’s business but for my own purposes I always wanna do music with people that I can really have respect for. I got a lot of good features on this project, good production, good topics and a lotta anthems. I got a lot of stories to tell too so, it’ll be real cool." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the rock–dance sound which {{dominated}} {{her previous}} album Simply Deep, Rowland {{felt she was}} still struggling with finding her sound as solo artist, and instead of capitalizing off its international success, the singer and her management settled on [...] "a more urban approach" [...] with her second album. Commenting on her decision, Rowland later told MTV News, [...] "in general, I'm going in the urban, more R route. Of course, that's what I started with Destiny's Child, [...] my first solo album I did more of a pop-sounding record. So I {{wanted to go back}} <b>to</b> my roots <b>and</b> <b>dibble</b> <b>and</b> <b>dabble</b> with some beats." [...] Consequently, Columbia Records consulted a wider range of contemporary R and hip hop producers and artists such as Big Tank, Patrick [...] "J. Que" [...] Smith, Rockwilder, Rich Harrison, Rodney Jerkins, and Robin Thicke to work with Rowland on the album. Female rappers Remy Ma, Eve, and Shawnna also lent their voices to guest parts.|$|R

40|$|This study {{identifies}} the socio-economic factors influencing the adoption decision of bunds <b>and</b> <b>dibbling</b> among small-scale lowland rice production in Northern Region of Ghana. The empirical application involved a cross-section sample of 342 lowland rice farmers in Ghana. The empirical {{evidence suggests that}} the adoption decision of bunds <b>and</b> <b>dibbling</b> are made jointly. The seemingly unrelated bivariate probit estimation on plot level indicates that access to credit, project involvement, family land / labour ratio, age, reported good results, number of bikes, area under other crops and number of labour equivalents frequently ill, as well as soil type and retention capacity influence the adoption decision of bunds. Dibbling is determined by factors as access to credit, project involvement, family land / labour ratio, area under other crops, perception of <b>dibbling</b> <b>and</b> farmer’s constraints and number of bulls. Also household heads are more likely <b>to</b> adopt <b>dibbling.</b> Plots characteristics are provision of LRDP bunds, soil quality and water retention capacity also influence the likelihood of adoption...|$|R

50|$|As the Tuskegee Syphilis Study {{raised a}} host of issues about racism, <b>Dibble’s</b> {{participation}} <b>and</b> encouragement of the study has been highly controversial, especially from his standing as a Black physician. The very premise {{of the study was}} {{based on the assumption that}} African Americans would not seek treatment for syphilis and that the disease affected them differently than other races. Another source of controversy arises from the degree of black cooperation in the study, which to this day, remains unclear. Although Dibble understood the nature of the experiment and supported it, there is evidence that some blacks who assisted in the study were not aware of the true nature of the experiment. However, many such as Fred Gray, a legal post who had been counsel to the Tuskegee Institute, supported <b>Dibble</b> <b>and</b> objected <b>to</b> holding <b>Dibble</b> accountable for the controversial events of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, arguing that Dibble was just as much a victim as the participants. His argument was based upon class divisions, and he argued that because black institutions relied heavily upon funding from white philanthropy, they could not afford to object to the US government for participation in the study.|$|R
