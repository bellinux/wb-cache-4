In both cases, to keep the overall cost low, vibrations are converted into variations of the light intensity, although this makes the received signal more sensitive to noise. Then, adaptive filters and advanced spectral estimation techniques are used to mitigate noise and improve the sensitivity. Preliminary results have demonstrated that the combined effect of these techniques can yield to a signal-to-noise improvement of about 30 dB, bringing the proposed approaches to the level of the most performing sensors for the measurement of vibrations...|$|E

A few studies have also shown that significant inelastic axial shortening affects the response of column elements subjected <b>to</b> <b>medium-high</b> levels of axial loads and cyclic bending. This paper is primarily aimed at evaluating the effects of column N-M interaction on the inelastic seismic response of steel frames. By considering the contemporaneous action of vertical loads, due to gravity, and of horizontal seismic excitation, it is shown that the progressive axial shortening of adjacent columns may differ substantially, thus inducing significant relative settlements at the ends of the connecting beams and, then, remarkable amplifications in beam plastic rotations. An evaluation of additional beam plastic rotations induced by column N-M interaction is carried out for real structures by investigating the inelastic response of steel frames designed according to European standards under horizontal and vertical earthquake excitations.

Unfortunately, these food additives are mostly present in convenience fast foods, soft drinks, which is the typical food consumed by our hemodialysis population, composed by elderly people, mostly low-socio economic class, who often live alone. To explore the association between socio-economic factors and serum phosphorus levels, we enrolled 100 patients on periodic hemodialysis treatment from 3 different units. Information, on social, cultural, economic, diet habits, therapy for hyperphosphoremia and haematological and clinical parameters had been collected through specific questionnaires administered by a physician. Statistical analysis was performed using correlation between variables with the linear regression analysis, and the stepwise logistic regression analysis, either analysis preceded by log- 10 transformation if the distribution of the variables was non-gaussian. The level of statistical significance was always set at P < 0. 05 Results showed serum phosphorus level was reduced in patients who live alone compared to patients in family (P= 0, 04), in self-sufficient (P= 0, 05) and in patients belonging <b>to</b> <b>medium-higher</b> versus lower socio-economic groups (P= 0, 003).

To understand this complex behavior, researchers have turned to quantitative, in vitro, image-based measurements to dissect the steps of cellular motility. With the rise of automated microscopy, the bottleneck in these approaches is no longer data acquisition, but data analysis. Using time-lapse microscopy and computer-assisted image analysis, we have developed a novel, quantitative assay that extracts a multivariate profile for cellular motility. This technique measures three dynamic parameters per single cell: speed, surface area, and an index of dynamic cell expansion/contraction activity (DECCA). Our assay {{can be used in}} combination with a variety of extracellular matrix components, or other soluble agents, to analyze the effects of the microenvironment on cellular migration dynamics in vitro. Our application was developed and tested using A 431 and HT- 1080 cell lines plated on laminin- 332 or fibronectin substrates. Our results indicate that HT- 1080 cells migrate faster, have a greater surface area, and have a higher DECCA index than A 431 cells on both matrices (for all parameters, p < 0. 05).
