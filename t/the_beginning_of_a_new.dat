5|$|As Ottoman {{rule in the}} Balkans expanded, Albanian timar holders and {{officials}} were once again replaced with Anatolian ones. The status quo ante bellum policies of the Ottomans gradually {{led to the formation}} of the League of Lezhë under Skanderbeg in 1444 and <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> era in the Ottoman-Albanian wars.|$|E
5|$|Kurt and Riela were {{featured}} in the Nintendo 3DS crossover Project X Zone, representing the Valkyria series.

5|$|The game {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, who praised {{the game for}} its unique blend of trance music and designer logos and cited that Wipeout 2097 was <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> trend in gaming to tap into popular culture and other arts. IGN ranked the game as the 13th best PlayStation game of all time in 2002.|$|E

5|$|The pre-release of the 2014 album 5. The Gray Chapter also {{witnessed}} {{a major change}} in the band’s logo and branding strategy. A new nonagram drew the public’s attention towards the band, announcing <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> era. The black and red color scheme and the minimalist, elegant design received public appreciation and it is still used today.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} {{to determine the extent to}} which the events of this war contributed to changes in the use and legal rights of Roman slaves. The end of the Servile Wars seems to have coincided with the end of the period of the most prominent use of slaves in Rome and <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> perception of slaves within Roman society and law. The Third Servile War was the last of the Servile Wars, and Rome did not see another slave uprising of this magnitude again.|$|E
5|$|Mycale was, in many ways, <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{phase in}} the conflict, in which the Greeks would go on the {{offensive}} against the Persians. The immediate result of the victory at Mycale was a second revolt amongst the Greek cities of Asia Minor. The Samians and Milesians had actively fought against the Persians at Mycale, thus openly declaring their rebellion, and the other cities followed in their example.|$|E

5|$|The {{dominant}} {{vegetation cover}} of coastal sage scrub typically goes through approximately 25-year cycles, with its peak biodiversity reached in roughly 10 years after <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> 25-year period. Such periods are typically separated by wildfires, which clear away dead or dying vegetation and leave bare ground for new growth. The canyon {{is one of}} the last remaining sanctuaries for many plants native to Southern California. Approximately one hundred species of plants, most native to California, are found in Laurel and Willow Canyons alone. These include monkey flower, goldenrod, and sagebrush.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} considerable {{praise for}} its technically challenging racing and fusion {{of popular culture}} elements. Many critics praised the unique blend of techno music and designer logos in one cohesive futuristic racing universe as <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> trend in gaming to tap into popular culture and other arts, which {{was made possible by}} the new storage space of the time.|$|E
5|$|After {{the victory}} at Mycale, the Allied fleet sailed to the Hellespont {{to break down}} the pontoon bridges, but found that this was already done. The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians {{remained}} to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians. The Persians in the region, and their allies, made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region, and the Athenians laid siege to them there. After a protracted siege, Sestos fell to the Athenians, marking <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> phase in the Greco-Persian Wars, the Greek counterattack. Herodotus ended his Histories after the Siege of Sestos. Over the next 30 years, the Greeks, primarily the Athenian-dominated Delian League, would expel (or help expel) the Persians from Macedon, Thrace, the Aegean islands and Ionia. Peace with Persia finally came in 449 BC with the Peace of Callias, finally ending the half-century of warfare.|$|E

5|$|An {{observational}} study by Logan {{demonstrates that the}} female is continuously {{evaluating the quality of}} the male and his territory. The assessment is usually triggered by the arrival of a new male in a neighboring territory at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> breeding season. In those cases, the mated female is constantly seen flying over both the original and the new male’s territory, evaluating the qualities of both territories and exchanging calls with both males. The social mate displays aggressive behaviors towards the female, while the new male shows less aggression and sings softer songs. At the same time, both the mated male and the new male will fly over other territories to attract other females as well. Divorce, mate switching and extra-pair matings do occur in northern mockingbirds.|$|E
5|$|Higginbotham's {{nomination}} {{was held up}} by Mississippi Senator James Eastland, {{the chairman of the}} Senate Judiciary Committee and a committed segregationist. Eastland delayed the nomination long enough so that, despite being passed by a subcommittee, Higginbotham's nomination lapsed following the death of President Kennedy, and <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> congressional term. He was ultimately appointed to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by President Lyndon Johnson as a recess appointment on January 6, 1964, and was confirmed by the Senate later that year. At the time of his appointment, he was 35 years old. Higginbotham became a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, of Yale University, and of Thomas Jefferson University.|$|E
5|$|His {{social and}} {{political}} activities resulted in a diminished literary output. He wrote a new historical novel, Na polu chwały (On the Field of Glory), that was meant as <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> trilogy; it was, however, criticized as being a lesser version of his original Trilogy, and was never continued. Similarly, his contemporary novel Wiry Whirlpool (novel), 1910, which sought to criticize some of Sienkiewicz's political opponents, received a mostly polemical and politicized response. His 1910 novel for young people, W pustyni i w puszczy (In Desert and Wilderness), serialized in Kurier Warszawski (The Warsaw Courier), finishing in 1911, was much better received and became widely popular among children and young adults.|$|E

5|$|In late 1939, he {{was accused}} by French {{military}} authorities of helping Palestinian rebels in the revolt, tried by a military court, and sentenced to five years imprisonment in the Citadel of Damascus. While his exile by the British abruptly curtailed his political life, his imprisonment marked <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> life wherein the Quran becomes a major concern {{for the next several}} years. He was released in November 1944. After his release, Darwaza was unable to return to Nablus because British authorities had issued an order preventing him from entering Palestine. As a result, he left for Turkey, mostly staying in Bursa until the end of 1945.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{reassigned to}} 10./JG 1 {{based in the}} Ruhr, he shot down his first Viermot (four-engined bomber), his 7th victory, on 26 February 1943. This was <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> war for Specht – the 8th USAAF was {{starting}} its bombing offensive on the Reich’s industrial complex. Soon afterward, on 27 March, he was appointed StaKa of the newly reformed 7./JG 1, then in May 1943 {{he was promoted to}} Kommandeur of II/JG 11. Jagdgeschwader 11 was a new fighter wing, created in April 1943 by dividing Jagdgeschwader 1 (flying Fw 190s) in half and filling it out into a full wing with new Gruppen flying Me 109G-6 'gunboats', to increase the homeland protection. He was based back near his original airfields on the North Sea coast, his unit {{the first line of defense}} against the bomber streams and their fighter escorts.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of Hungary was {{defeated}} by the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Mohács in 1526. The Turks besieged and damaged Pressburg, but failed to conquer it. Owing to Ottoman advances into Hungarian territory, the city was designated the new capital of Hungary in 1536, {{becoming part of the}} Austrian Habsburg monarchy and marking <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> era. The city became a coronation town and the seat of kings, archbishops (1543), the nobility and all major organisations and offices. Between 1536 and 1830, eleven Hungarian kings and queens were crowned at St. Martin's Cathedral. The 17th century was marked by anti-Habsburg uprisings, fighting with the Turks, floods, plagues and other disasters, which diminished the population.|$|E

5|$|The image {{illustration}} and logo {{design was}} done by Yoshitaka Amano, who was brought on {{at the beginning of}} the game's production and designged the logo based on the game's themes. Several pieces of Amano's original artwork were retained and used in promotion when the game changed from Versus XIII to XV. In contrast to other major parts of the game, the logo artwork survived almost unchanged aside from its coloring. Amano also designed a new version of the logo that faded in during the game's ending, collaborating with the development team on its use. According to Tabata, the new logo signified <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> journey, and also representing the game's development since it was known as Versus XIII.|$|E
5|$|The mid-1970s saw <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> wave of Canadian comics, one {{in which}} the creators chose to remain in Canada, rather than seeking their {{fortunes}} south of the border. Richard Comely's Captain Canuck appeared in July 1975, the first appearance of a non-satirical superhero in Canada since the 1940s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the idea of native comics seemed unattainable to Canadian kids, and the appearance of Captain Canuck gave these kids the optimism to make their own. This was followed up with James Waley's more professional, newsstand-distributed Orb, which featured a number of talents that would later take part in the North American comics scene.|$|E
5|$|Various astronomical {{alignments}} and numerological formulae were {{proposed as}} pertaining to this date.

Others suggested that the date marked {{the end of the world}} or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world included the arrival of the next solar maximum, an interaction between Earth and the black hole at the center of the galaxy, or Earth's collision with a planet called Nibiru.|$|E
