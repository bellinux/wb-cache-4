500|$|Killen {{said that}} writing the pilot episode's script {{was one of}} the more-difficult {{components}} of creating the show. He and his writing team would often get confused with exchanging and executing ideas for the script; as a result they created outlines, distinguishing the separate realities with green or red ink.

500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik was {{released}} on September 24, 1991, {{the same day as}} Nirvana's breakthrough album Nevermind. It was certified gold just over two months later on November 26, 1991, and certified platinum on April 1, 1992; since then it has gone seven times platinum in the United States. The album peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200. Originally, [...] "Give it Away" [...] did not fare well in the mainstream; several of Warner Bros.' target radio stations refused to air it, telling the band to [...] "come back <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>when</b> you have a melody in your song." [...] KROQ (of Los Angeles), however, began to play the single several times daily, and that, according to Kiedis, [...] "was the beginning of the infusion of 'Give It Away' into mass consciousness." [...] The single ultimately peaked at number 9 on the UK Top 40 and number 73 on the Billboard Hot 100. Blood Sugar Sex Magik has sold over 13 million copies worldwide.|$|E
500|$|In January 2012, Little Mix begun {{recording}} {{songs for}} their debut album. The group worked with production team TMS, and Iain James {{on a number}} of songs at The Music Shed in London, England, four of which were chosen for the album. One of these four songs was [...] "DNA," [...] which subsequently became the title of the album. The song originated from the group's personal experiences in romantic situations. The group wanted to create a song about their own experiences so that they could improve the quality of their live performances. Edwards said: [...] "We perform better when the lyrics mean something <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>when</b> we sing them." [...] "DNA" [...] was developed to manifest a completely different side to Little Mix. When creating the song, Little Mix took into consideration which of their performances during their time on The X Factor was the most popular. Their performance of Katy Perry's [...] "E.T." [...] was the week during The X Factor where the group received the most votes. The group's version of [...] "E.T." [...] was perceived as [...] "quite dark" [...] by Jade Thirlwall, in turn, Thirlwall said that the group wanted [...] "DNA" [...] to showcase a darker side of the group. Thirlwall told Sarah Dean of The Huffington Post that the song was also inspired to show how the group has grown in maturity.|$|E

500|$|Two days later, on 26 August, the Beatles {{travelled}} {{by train}} {{to the college}} campus in Bangor, Wales. It was perhaps {{the first time the}} band had travelled without their tour managers and they had not even thought to bring money. The station was mobbed because of a bank holiday and Cynthia Lennon, mistaken for a fan, was held back. She ran after the train but missed it and arrived later by car. The group, along with Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, Cilla Black, Harrison's sister-in-law Jenny Boyd, and around 300 others, learned the basics of Transcendental Meditation, and were given their mantras. The group [...] "hesitated only slightly" [...] when asked to donate the customary week's wages, a large sum for a Beatle, to learn. While there, they announced at a press conference that they were giving up drugs (apparently referring to psychedelics, but not marijuana). This was a choice [...] "in keeping with the Maharishi's teachings" [...] but one made prior to meeting the Maharishi. The Maharishi did advise them privately to avoid involvement with the [...] "Ban the Bomb" [...] movement and to support the elected government of the day. Their intention was to attend the entire ten-day seminar but their stay was cut short by the death of their manager, Epstein, in London on 27 August. The Maharishi consoled them by saying that Epstein's spirit was still with them and their good thoughts would help him [...] "to have an easy passage" [...] and journey to his [...] "next evolution". According to McCartney, the Maharishi [...] "was great <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>when</b> Brian died" [...] and Cynthia Lennon wrote [...] "it was as though, with Brian gone, the four needed someone new to give them direction and the Maharishi was {{in the right place at}} the right time." ...|$|E

We knew it was time to adapt to the shifting tides of the music industry and we could not be more thrilled about doing that in conjunction with the team at Epitaph." [...] Singer and bassist Dan Andriano added: [...] "For our band at this time it really makes sense to release our own records, but we wanted to make sure we could partner up with good people who we would want to share in something very special <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> <b>When</b> Brett [...] called and said he wanted to be involved, that was it.
