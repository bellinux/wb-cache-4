40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyses}} {{the possibilities}} of substitution between different kinds of equipment {{that can be used}} to produce electricity. We focus on the three main types of <b>equipment</b> namely hydraulic, <b>thermal</b> and nuclear. Our approach is a primal approach; we estimate CES and Generalized Leontief production functions on data from the European Communities Statistical Office (EUROSTAT) and the U. S. Department of Energy. Our main result is that nuclear and thermal units are shown as strong substitutes whatever the data or the functional forms we have used for econometric estimation. This result shows that the markets for nuclear and <b>thermal</b> <b>equipments</b> cannot be considered as separate markets. This conclusion is important with regard to the debate over the definition of markets within the energy sector. It is also important, with respect to the response the electric power generation sector can give, to any change in the relative prices of primary energies Key words: productions function, elasticity of substitution, electric power generatio...|$|R

Size of recirculation vortex, center of recirculation vortex for various Reynolds number with center to center distance between the blocks in the stream wise direction of the flow (Lx/Ly ratio) equal to 2, are the parameters reported when water is used as the working fluid. Outcome of this experimental study shows that, the size of the vortex increases with the increase of Reynolds number and the center of the vortex shifts in the direction of flow downstream of the blocks. Reynolds number considered for this study ranges from 800 to 1500 with a step of 100. Flow visualisation for the range of Reynolds number is presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{professional}} standards for heat treatment specialists such as "Specialist in <b>thermal</b> <b>equipment</b> installation and tests", "Specialist in analysis and diagnosis of heat treatment process systems", "Specialist in automation and mechanization of heat treatment process systems" were developed {{according to the}} Rules for the Development, Approval, and Application of Professional Standards adopted by a Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation dated 01. 22. 2013 № 23. The article objective {{is to find a}} way that allows directors of machine-building plants to understand the provisions of abovementioned {{professional standards}}. This commentary was developed with participation of experts, who were in charge of the professional standards. When developing the professional standards it was taken into consideration that, presently, the most promising are vacuum and ion processes of heat and thermo-chemical treatment. In this connection a new classification of the <b>thermal</b> <b>equipment</b> and manufacturing processes has been realized according to criterion of technical complexity. This classification puts the <b>thermal</b> <b>equipment</b> and manufacturing processes into simple, complex, and specifically complex. As proposed, the specifically complex <b>thermal</b> <b>equipment</b> is a multi-zone thermal one with each zone being under precise temperature control, and a vacuum or ion equipment for thermal and thermochemical treatment with integrated cooling system. The complex <b>thermal</b> <b>equipment</b> is an equipment for heat and thermochemical treatment in controlled atmosphere, and a multichamber or continuous heat treatment furnaces, as well as vacuum and ion-plasma equipment, except for specifically complex <b>thermal</b> <b>equipment.</b> The simple <b>thermal</b> <b>equipment</b> is a heat treatment one except for complex and specifically complex <b>thermal</b> <b>equipment.</b> The article gives concrete examples of simple, complex and specifically complex <b>thermal</b> <b>equipment.</b> The criteria to classify the heat treatment technological processes are also presented.
