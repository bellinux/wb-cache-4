The clinical aspects of confirmed and probable cases of infection with this virus indicate that it has pathogenic properties in humans similar to those of other viruses of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis complex. To determine the prevalence of antibodies to <b>Tonate</b> <b>virus</b> in the various ethnic groups and areas of French Guiana, 3, 516 human sera were tested with a hemagglutination inhibition test. Of these, 11. 9 % were positive for the virus, but significant differences in seroprevalence were found by age, with an increase with age. After adjustment for age, {{significant differences were found between}} places of residence. The prevalence of antibody to <b>Tonate</b> <b>virus</b> was higher in savannah areas, especially in the Bas Maroni (odds ratio [OR] 22. 2, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 15. 2 – 32. 4) and Bas Oyapock areas (OR 13. 4; 95 % CI 9. 8 – 18. 4). The ethnic differences observed in this study were due mainly to differences in place of residence, except that whites were significantly less frequently infected than other ethnic groups. This study indicates that <b>Tonate</b> <b>virus</b> infection is highly prevalent in French Guiana, especially in savannah areas...|$|E

40|$|Partial E 1 {{envelope}} glycoprotein gene sequences and complete structural polyprotein sequences {{were used to}} compare divergence and construct phylogenetic trees for the genus Alphavirus. Tree topologies indicated that the mosquito-borne alphaviruses could have arisen in either the Old or the New World, {{with at least two}} transoceanic introductions to account for their current distribution. The time frame for alphavirus diversifi-cation could not be estimated because maximum-likelihood analyses indicated that the nucleotide substitution rate varies considerably across sites within the genome. While most trees showed evolutionary relationships consistent with current antigenic complexes and species, several changes to the current classification are proposed. The recently identified fish alphaviruses salmon pancreas disease virus and sleeping disease virus appear to be variants or subtypes of a new alphavirus species. Southern elephant seal virus is also a new alphavirus distantly related to all of the others analyzed. <b>Tonate</b> <b>virus</b> and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus strain 78 V 3531 also appear to be distinct alphavirus species based on genetic, antigenic, and ecological criteria. Trocara virus, isolated from mosquitoes in Brazil and Peru, also represents a new species and probably a new alphavirus complex. The family Togaviridae is comprised of two genera, Alpha-virus and Rubivirus (77). The genus Alphavirus contains at leas...|$|E
