The player will only be able to capture levels if the area around it is clear, or {{captured}} by <b>their</b> <b>team.</b> The game ends when the time runs out, score limit is reached, or if the player is able to capture all control points.|$|E

5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last Australian tour in 1938, the team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted only six England players from the season's Tests be allowed to compete. After his opponents had finalised <b>their</b> <b>team,</b> Bradman fielded a full-strength team, and Brown missed out. The match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.|$|E

5|$|Originally, the French {{team were}} {{scheduled}} to play a team from the United States, but the latter withdrew from the competition as three of <b>their</b> <b>team</b> were {{taking place in the}} hammer throw at the same time. The Scandinavians were accepted as late entrants by the organisers, and <b>their</b> <b>team</b> was composed primarily of athletes who were competing in other events, though it also included a journalist, Edgar Aabye, to make up the numbers. The mixed team won each of the first two pulls against the French in a best-of-three contest to win the gold medal. Due to a second, unofficial, match subsequently taking place between the United States and the Scandinavians, some records have erroneously listed the United States as gold medalists.|$|E
