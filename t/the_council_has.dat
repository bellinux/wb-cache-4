5|$|The {{development}} of <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>has</b> been characterised {{by the rise}} in power of the Parliament, with which <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>has</b> had to share its legislative powers. The Parliament has often provided opposition to the Council's wishes. This has in some cases led to clashes between both bodies with the Council's system of intergovernmentalism contradicting the developing parliamentary system and supranational principles.|$|E

The Minneapolis City Council holds the most power and represents the city's thirteen districts called wards. The city adopted instant-runoff voting in 2006, first using it in the 2009 elections. <b>The</b> <b>council</b> <b>has</b> 12 DFL members and one from the Green Party.

50|$|As {{the subsidy}} {{remained}} unpaid, <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> remained in being during {{the remainder of}} Requesens' tenure. No further death sentences were pronounced. After Requesens' death in March 1576 a power vacuum ensued. <b>The</b> <b>Council</b> of State now demanded to see the instructions and records of the tribunal. However, the secretary, De Roda, replied {{that there were no}} written instructions. When asked how <b>the</b> <b>council</b> <b>had</b> managed to try and condemn so many people, he said that <b>the</b> <b>council</b> <b>had</b> condemned nobody: all sentences were pronounced by the governors-general themselves; <b>the</b> <b>council</b> <b>had</b> technically only prepared the drafts.|$|R
5|$|The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) assists the General Assembly in {{promoting}} international {{economic and social}} co-operation and development. ECOSOC has 54 members, which are elected by the General Assembly for a three-year term. The president is elected for a one-year term and chosen amongst the small or middle powers represented on ECOSOC. <b>The</b> <b>council</b> <b>has</b> one annual meeting in July, held in either New York or Geneva. Viewed as separate from the specialized bodies it co-ordinates, ECOSOC's functions include information gathering, advising member nations, and making recommendations. Owing to its broad mandate of co-ordinating many agencies, ECOSOC has at times been criticized as unfocused or irrelevant.|$|E
5|$|The common council {{consists}} of 10 members, six {{of whom are}} elected from single-member districts. The other four, including its president, are elected at-large. <b>The</b> <b>council</b> <b>has</b> eight standing committees for issues including transportation, education, finance and public safety. There is a relative balance between the Democratic and Republican parties, a change from the predominantly single-party politics of the 20thcentury. Throughout the 1950s, Democrats ran the city council and mayoralty.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{being criticized}} for its limited powers, {{there is also}} some concern that the Council's {{responsibilities}} may go too far. By taking up the function of scrutinizing existing and prospective legislation for differentiating measures and inconsistencies with fundamental liberties, the Council may be encroaching on the functions of constitutional interpretation, which is traditionally the function of courts. Even though <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>has</b> the additional advantage of identifying potentially unconstitutional legislation at an early stage, thereby preventing unnecessary litigation in the future, there is doubt as to the ability of the Council to take on such a task. Given that constitutional interpretation is traditionally the function of lawyers and the courts, the task may be best carried out by the legally trained members of the PCMR.|$|E

5|$|By a {{decision}} of the European Council at Edinburgh in December 1992, <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>has</b> its seat in Brussels but in April, June, and October, it holds its meetings in Luxembourg. Between 1952 and 1967 the ECSC Council held its Luxembourg meetings in the Cercle Municipal on Place d’Armes. Its secretariat moved on numerous occasions but between 1955 and 1967 it was housed in the Verlorenkost district of the city. In 1957 {{with the creation of}} two new Communities with their own Councils, discretion on location was given to the current President. In practice this was to be in the Château of Val-Duchesse until the autumn of 1958, at which point it moved to 2 Rue Ravensteinstraat in Brussels.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} of an absence, disability, or other cause {{preventing}} the mayor from performing his duties, the mayor may designate the business administrator or any other department head as acting mayor for up to 60 days. In {{the event of}} a vacancy in the office, the President of the City Council becomes acting mayor, and <b>the</b> <b>council</b> <b>has</b> 30 days to name an interim mayor. If no interim mayor is named, the Council President continues as acting mayor until a successor is elected, or the council reorganizes and selects a new President. Prior to 1971, there was no automatic succession law. The office was left vacant for 47 days in 1963 when the City Council failed to reach a decision on appointing an interim mayor.|$|E

There are 26 wards electing a total of 67 councillors in the District. The council elects on a four-yearly cycle with all seats up for election at the same time. It first had elections in 1995—a year before it came into its powers—as a shadow authority. Between 1995 and 2007 the council had No overall control. In the 2007 local elections the Conservative Party gained a majority of seats, {{including those of the}} Liberal Democrat and Labour Party leaders. <b>The</b> <b>council</b> <b>has</b> a leader-and-executive system, the leader being Stephen Parnaby of the Conservatives. In the Audit Commission report covering 2007 the council was given a four-star rating, which places the authority {{as one of the best}} in the country.|$|E
5000|$|Limerick County Council (Comhairle Contae Luimnigh) was the {{authority}} responsible for local government in County Limerick, Ireland.

5|$|The Parliament and Council {{have been}} {{compared}} to the two chambers of a bicameral legislature. However, there are some differences from national legislatures; for example, neither the Parliament nor the Council have the power of legislative initiative (except {{for the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>has</b> the power in some intergovernmental matters). In Community matters, this is a power uniquely reserved for the European Commission (the executive). Therefore, while Parliament can amend and reject legislation, to make a proposal for legislation, it needs the Commission to draft a bill before anything can become law. The value of such a power has been questioned by noting that in the national legislatures of the member states 85% of initiatives introduced without executive support fail to become law. Yet it has been argued by former Parliament president Hans-Gert Pöttering that as the Parliament does have the right to ask the Commission to draft such legislation, and as the Commission is following Parliament's proposals more and more Parliament does have a de facto right of legislative initiative.|$|E
5|$|The {{organization}} {{is led by}} a high priest/priestess, {{who is also the}} public face of the Temple. The high priest is chosen among fourth or higher degree members by the chairman of the Council of Nine. This ruling council has nine members chosen from the priesthood (third degree or higher), whose mandate lasts for nine years with a new member being elected every year. The chairman of the council is chosen from among the council members each year. <b>The</b> <b>council</b> <b>has</b> the ultimate ruling power in the Temple and even the high priest is responsible to it. The Temple also has an executive director, whose task is to deal with administrative issues.|$|E
5|$|The upper tier is Somerset County Council. Also {{based in}} Taunton, <b>the</b> <b>council</b> <b>has</b> 58 councillors, each elected for a {{single-member}} electoral division. Most {{of the town}} comprises the Wellington electoral division, with part falling in the mainly rural division of Blackdown & Wellington East.

5|$|Together, the Permanent Members {{form the}} North Atlantic Council (NAC), a body which meets {{together}} {{at least once}} a week and has effective governance authority and powers of decision in NATO. From time to time the Council also meets at higher level meetings involving foreign ministers, defence ministers or heads of state or government (HOSG) and it is at these meetings that major decisions regarding NATO's policies are generally taken. However, it is worth noting that <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>has</b> the same authority and powers of decision-making, and its decisions have the same status and validity, at whatever level it meets. France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States are together referred to as the Quint, which is an informal discussion group within NATO. NATO summits also form a further venue for decisions on complex issues, such as enlargement.|$|E
