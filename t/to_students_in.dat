5|$|Al-Ghazaly High School, a co-ed {{religious}} {{day school}} for seventh through twelfth grades founded in 1984, was located on 441 North Street, serving the Muslim community from the greater Teaneck area. The school relocated {{to a larger}} facility in Wayne and opened its doors <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> September 2013, with the Teaneck facility repurposed to serve students in pre-Kindergarten through eighth grade {{with the name of}} Academy of Greatness and Excellence which is also an Islamic school.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, {{the school}} adopted the General Certificate of Education, but {{students}} {{were barred from}} taking any exams {{before the age of}} 16, which meant that many students left school without any qualifications because of the sheer necessity of leaving school to contribute to household income. The system became more rational in time, but often pupils were taking O-levels and A-levels simultaneously. As of 2010, the school offers GCSEs <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> the lower school, and AS/A-levels <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> the sixth form. Under Rendall, exam pass rates at A-level increased from 67.5percent in 1970, peaking at 95percent in 1984 before decreasing slightly to 92percent in 1987. O-level/GCSE results have similarly improved, reaching a peak of 88percent pass rate in 1978. League tables published by the BBC based on 2008 A-level results rank Judd as the fourth best school in Kent. According to the BBC, in 2009 A-level students achieved an average of 999.2 QCDA points, against a national average of 739.1 and 100percent of students achieved five or more grade C results (or equivalent) at GCSE, including Maths and English. In its league table of the 500 best state secondary schools in the United Kingdom, The Sunday Times ranked The Judd School 27th.|$|E

5|$|The Advanced Placement {{program has}} offered {{students}} the opportunity to pursue college-level courses while in high school. Along with the Educational Testing Service, the College Board administered the first AP Statistics exam in May 1997. The course was first taught <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> the 1996-1997 academic year. Prior to that, the only mathematics courses offered in the AP program included AP Calculus AB and BC. Students who didn't have a strong background in college-level math, however, found the AP Calculus program inaccessible and sometimes declined to take a math course in their senior year. Since the number of students required to take statistics in college is almost as large as the number of students required to take calculus, the College Board decided to add an introductory statistics course to the AP program. Since the prerequisites for such a program doesn't require mathematical concepts beyond those typically taught in a second-year algebra course, the AP program's math offerings became accessible to a much wider audience of high school students. The AP Statistics program addressed a practical need as well, since the number of students enrolling in majors that use statistics has grown. A total of 7,667 students took the exam during the first administration, which is the highest number of students to take an AP exam in its first year. Since then, the number of students taking the exam rapidly grew to 98,033 in 2007, {{making it one of the}} 10 largest AP exams.|$|E
