5|$|Verses 4.26–35 {{state that}} the human body has {{fourteen}} nadis (blood vessels), of which three are primary. Sushumna (Sanskrit: सुषुम्णा) is the most important, as it extends all along the spinal cord and reaches into the head, sustaining <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>body.</b> Vishnu is the deity whose power propels Sushumna according to verse 4.31. On {{both sides of the}} Sushumna reside the Ida and Pingala vessels, the former connected to the moon and the latter to the sun. These three drive the three Guṇas (forces behind the innate character) of a being, with Sushumna driving Sattva (goodness), Pingala driving the Rajas (action), and Ida driving the Tamas (destructiveness). These primary vessels are connected to numerous channels inside the human body, which pervade <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>body,</b> and nourish it.|$|E
5|$|Nemerteans lack {{specialized}} gills, and respiration occurs {{over the}} surface of the body, which is long and sometimes flattened. Like other animals with thick body walls, they use fluid circulation rather than diffusion to move substances through their bodies. The circulatory system consists of the rhynchocoel and peripheral vessels, while blood of other invertebrates is contained in the main body cavity. The fluid in the rhynchocoel moves substances to and from the proboscis, and functions as a fluid skeleton in everting the proboscis and in burrowing. The vessels circulate fluid round <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> and the rhynchocoel provides its own local circulation. The circulatory vessels are a system of coeloms.|$|E

Where functions are considered administrative, delegation may not be wrongful. In R. v.

5|$|The {{sacrament of}} Holy Orders consecrates and deputes some Christians to serve <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> {{as members of}} three degrees or orders: episcopate (bishops), presbyterate (priests) and diaconate (deacons). The Church has defined rules on who may be ordained into the clergy. In the Latin Church, the priesthood is {{generally}} restricted to celibate men, and the episcopate is always restricted to celibate men. Men who are already married may be ordained in certain Eastern Catholic churches in most countries, and the personal ordinariates and may become deacons even in the Western Church (see Clerical marriage). But after becoming a Catholic priest, a man may not marry (see Clerical celibacy) unless he is formally laicised.|$|E
5|$|Cathedrals {{are places}} where the Christian rituals {{particular}} to a bishop, especially ordination and enthronement, can be performed, and are structured and furnished for these purposes. Each cathedral contains {{the seat of the}} local bishop, often literally a large throne. The bishop's throne is located towards the eastern end of the cathedral, near the high altar, which is main focus of worship. On the altar is served the Eucharist, a symbolic meal of bread and wine in memory of Jesus’ last supper with his disciples. In the early Medieval period, the altar always contained, or was associated with, the relics of a saint. Sometimes the relics were held in a separate shrine, near the high altar. In this part of the church are often located the tombs of former bishops, typically arranged either side of the major shrine, so the worshipping congregation symbolically comprised <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> of clergy of the diocese, both living and dead, in communion with their patron saint. Seats are provided for the other significant clergy of the cathedral: the dean who is the foremost priest at the cathedral, the precentor, sacristan, archdeacon and canons.|$|E

5|$|Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, {{including}} purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, {{and several}} {{different forms of}} meowing. (By contrast, feral cats are generally silent.) Their types of body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>body,</b> and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood. The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats; for example, a raised tail acts as a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicates hostility. Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate animals. Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited {{by one of the}} cats raising and tilting its head.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} used by White is unrecorded, but in 1748 {{he had studied}} under the anatomist William Hunter, who had developed an early system of arterial embalming, therefore {{it is likely that}} White used the same method. The veins and arteries would have been injected with a mixture of turpentine and vermilion, after which the organs would have been removed from the chest and abdomen and placed in water, to clean them and to reduce their bulk. As much blood as possible would then have been squeezed out of the corpse, and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> washed with alcohol. The next stage would have been to replace the organs and to repeat the injection of turpentine and vermilion. The body cavities would then have been filled with a mixture of camphor, nitre and resin, before the body was sewn up and all openings filled with camphor. After a final washing, the body would have been packed into a box containing plaster of Paris, to absorb any moisture, and then probably coated with tar, to preserve it.|$|E
5|$|Discus {{is one of}} {{the events}} where the athlete has to throw a heavy disc in the attempt to mark a farther {{distance}} than their competitors. As one of the events within the ancient pentathlon, the history of the discus throw dates back to 708 BC. In ancient times a heavy circular disc was thrown from a set standing position on a small pedestal, and it was this style that was revived for the 1896 Olympics. This continued until the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens, which featured both the ancient style and the increasingly popular modern style of turning and throwing. By the 1912 Olympics, the ancient standing throw style had fallen into disuse and contests starting within a 2.5m squared throwing area became the standard. The discus implement was standardised to 2kg (4.4pounds) in weight and 22cm (8inches) in diameter in 1907. The women's discus was among the first women's events on the Olympic programme, being introduced in 1928., although they had been competing at some national and regional levels previously.The first modern athlete to throw the discus while rotating <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> was Czech athlete Frantisek Janda-Suk.

30|$|Concentrations in <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bodies</b> of Se (Fig.  2) {{appeared}} to increase with stream distance downstream and Hg (Fig.  3) tended to decrease which poses {{the question whether}} there was a significant inverse relationship between the two. However, in this study, regression analysis did not show a significant interaction (positive or negative) between the mercury and selenium in <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bodies</b> of <b>the</b> fish in the Fountain Creek watershed. A review of Se and Hg interactions by others suggested that neither positive nor negative correlations are consistent (Stewart et al. 2010). In the Stewart et al. (2010) review, three investigators found no correlation between Se and Hg while two investigators found a negative correlation. In order to find correlations between tissue-Se and tissue-Hg, our survey probably had insufficient numbers of specimens, differing species compositions collected at sites, and no single year-class comparisons. Furthermore, the three segments of the watershed had differing elevations, water temperatures (cold, cool and warm-waters) and food bases.|$|R
30|$|As stated earlier, {{this study}} {{was a matter of}} {{reconnaissance}} and discovery related {{to the question of whether}} Se would be found in <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bodies</b> of fish throughout the Fountain Creek watershed and if so, to what extent was the accumulation? (However, not anticipated was finding mercury in all fish). Our initial plan was to collect, as much as possible, a single fish species from 14 sites for comparisons of contamination by site, or at least, comparison of stream segments; however, collecting a single species was not possible because upper Fountain and Monument Creeks begin as cold water streams with markedly different assemblages of fish. Therefore, this report will focus on baseline data for selenium and mercury in the tissues of brown trout, a cold-water species and five warm-water species plus an initial study on the localization of Se and Hg in four selected tissues including the ovaries. We were not able to subject the data to rigorous statistical analysis but we were able to indicate trends of tissue-Se and tissue-Hg in fish <b>whole</b> <b>bodies</b> and selected tissues. We used regression analysis to determine whether a direct or inverse relationship existed between concentrations of Se and Hg in <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bodies</b> of fish at the 14 sites.|$|R

40|$|The oxygen isotope {{composition}} of bivalve shells (δ 18 Oshell) can potentially record environmental variability of shallow lakes {{and therefore it}} has been extensively used as a proxy in the reconstruction of past climate and environmental conditions. As δ 18 Oshell reflects - besides the water temperature - the oxygen isotope {{composition of}} lake water (δ 18 OL), it is required to interpret the quality and impact of parameters influencing the δ 18 OL. Using the isotope mass balance model, I tested the hypothesis that Balaton lake water δ 18 O variability {{can be described as}} a result of the combined effects of three main climatic parameters such as river runoff, precipitation and evaporation. I calculated δ 18 OL time series for the period 1999 - 2008 for <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> water <b>body</b> at Siófok (eastern part of Lake Balaton, Hungary) based on measured precipitation, inflow and evaporation amount and measured inflow, precipitation δ 18 O and calculated vapour δ 18 O data. The comparison of the modelled δ 18 OL time series to measured surface δ 18 OL data revealed that δ 18 O of Balaton water is sensitive for variation of climatic parameters. This variability is most striking at the surface, while according to the results of <b>the</b> model, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> water <b>body</b> itself is less sensitive. Monthly differences suggest that generally during summer <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> water <b>body</b> is mixed up, while moderate isotope stratification (0. 3 - 0. 7 ‰ difference between surface and <b>whole</b> water <b>body)</b> can be assumed in early spring and autumn. Predictions of shell δ 18 O values were made using the measured surface water δ 18 O data and the modelled δ 18 O values for <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> water <b>body.</b> High-resolution sampling was conducted on two Unio pictorum shells covering the period of 2001 - 2008, and both predictions were compared to measured shell δ 18 O records. The results showed that the prediction for <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> water <b>body</b> gives a better fit to the measured shell δ 18 O, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> water <b>body</b> better describes the isotope variability of shell carbonate. As a practical application of the isotope mass balance model was used to present the effect of precipitation and evaporation on δ 18 Oshell. The relationship between intra-shell δ 18 O-variability and precipitation amount (precipitation/evaporation ratio) were determined, which allows the quantified prediction the impact of meteorological parameters affecting the oxygen isotope composition of shell carbonate...|$|R
