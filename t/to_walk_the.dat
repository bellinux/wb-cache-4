With Australia in the field, Bradman sent Miller to the fine leg boundary as a punishment—between overs, he was forced <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>the</b> length of the field. One of the spectators felt sorry for Miller and lent him his bicycle, which Miller used to cycle around the circumference of the ground.|$|E

5|$|Apatosaurus is {{a member}} of the family Diplodocidae, a clade of {{gigantic}} sauropod dinosaurs. The family includes some of the longest creatures ever <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>the</b> earth, including Diplodocus, Supersaurus, and Barosaurus. Apatosaurus is sometimes classified in the subfamily Apatosaurinae, which may also include Suuwassea, Supersaurus, and Brontosaurus. Othniel Charles Marsh described Apatosaurus as allied to Atlantosaurus within the now-defunct group Atlantosauridae. In 1878 Marsh raised his family to the rank of suborder, including Apatosaurus, Atlantosaurus, Morosaurus (=Camarasaurus) and Diplodocus. He classified this group within Sauropoda, a group he erected in the same study. In 1903 Elmer S. Riggs said the name Sauropoda would be a junior synonym of earlier names; he grouped Apatosaurus within Opisthocoelia. Sauropoda is still used as the group name. In 2011, John Whitlock published a study that placed Apatosaurus a more basal diplodocid, sometimes less basal than Supersaurus.|$|E
5|$|By 1604, when Charles {{was three}} and a half, he was able <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>the</b> length of the great hall at Dunfermline Palace without assistance, and {{it was decided that}} he was strong enough to make the journey to England to be reunited with his family. In mid-July 1604, Charles left Dunfermline for England where he was to spend {{most of the rest of}} his life. In England, Charles was placed under the charge of Elizabeth, Lady Carey, the wife of courtier Sir Robert Carey, who put him in boots made of Spanish leather and brass to help {{strengthen}} his weak ankles. His speech development was also slow, and he retained a stammer, or hesitant speech, for the rest of his life.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{has been}} around horses since she was four months old, {{and was able to}} ride on her own {{by the time she was}} two years old, before she learned <b>to</b> <b>walk.</b> <b>The</b> sport gave her a degree of independence. She started {{competing}} in 2005, and first represented Australia in 2006, winning her first test in England that year.In 2008, she became the youngest-ever winner of the Australian national championships. She finished first at the March 2009 inter-schools cup at the St Ives Showground, and second at the 2009 Australian national championships, but her horse, Lucifer's Dream, was injured in 2009. In 2009 and 2010, she searched for another horse to assist her in getting through Paralympic qualification. She won the Australian national championships again in 2011, along with the Oceania Championships and the National Titles team events. By 2012, she was the top-ranked Australian competitor in her event and class.|$|E
