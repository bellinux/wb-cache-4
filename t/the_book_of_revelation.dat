5|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{feared that}} they would be assassinated, and taught their {{followers}} that their deaths would be {{similar to those of the}} two witnesses of <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Revelation.</b> Balch and Taylor believe that Applewhite's prison experience and early rejection by audiences contributed to this fear. Applewhite and Nettles later explained to their followers that the former's treatment by the press was a form of assassination and had fulfilled their prophecy. Applewhite took a materialistic view of the Bible, seeing it as a record of extraterrestrial contact with humanity. He drew heavily from <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Revelation,</b> although he avoided traditional theological terminology and took a somewhat negative tone towards Christianity. He only lectured about a small number of verses and never tried to develop a system of theology.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Rutherford {{published}} a systematic reinterpretation of <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Revelation.</b> Many of the symbols {{recorded in the}} book were applied to events following 1918, specifically to Watch Tower conventions held in the years 1922 through 1928. These reinterpretations reflected both a wholesale rejection of his own earlier views {{as well as the}} historicist interpretations of Pastor Russell.|$|E
5|$|Although the Gospel of John is anonymous, Christian {{tradition}} {{historically has}} attributed it to John the Apostle, son of Zebedee {{and one of}} Jesus' Twelve Apostles. The gospel is so closely related in style and content to the three surviving Johannine epistles that commentators treat the four books, along with <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Revelation,</b> as a single corpus of Johannine literature, albeit not necessarily written by the same author.|$|E

5|$|Irenaeus' eschatology {{was based}} on a literal {{interpretation}} of the Bible, especially <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Revelation.</b> He believed that there would be 6000 years of suffering before the world ends in a fiery purge. This fire would purify believers ahead of a new human community existing in the New Jerusalem. The afterlife, Irenaeus proposed, focuses more on time than space; he looked forward to a time in which humans are fully developed and live the life of God.|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the three}} narthex entrances sits below a tympanum. These 3 tympana were {{designed}} and sculpted by John Angel. The tympanum above the main, west entrance depicts Jesus as described in <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Revelation,</b> together with the four beasts and other relevant iconography. It resembles the tympanum of the Royal Portal of Chartres Cathedral. Beneath the figure of Christ is Princeton University's shield, illustrating the university's motto, Dei sub numine viget ("Under the power of God she flourishes"). The tympana above {{the north and south}} entrances depict the Annunciation and the Baptism of Christ, respectively.|$|E
5|$|For the Gospels, Sinaiticus is {{generally}} considered among scholars as the second most reliable witness of the text (after Vaticanus); in the Acts of the Apostles, its text is {{equal to that of}} Vaticanus; in the Epistles, Sinaiticus is the most reliable witness of the text. In <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Revelation,</b> however, its text is corrupted and is considered of poor quality, and inferior to the texts of Codex Alexandrinus, Papyrus 47, and even some minuscule manuscripts in this place (for example, Minuscule 2053, 2062).|$|E
5|$|Claiming that {{corporations}} and government {{are planning to}} track every move of consumers and citizens with RFID as the latest step toward a 1984-like surveillance state, consumer privacy advocates, such as Katherine Albrecht and Liz McIntyre, have become Christian conspiracy theorists who believe spychips must be resisted because they argue that modern database and communications technologies, coupled with point of sale data-capture equipment and sophisticated ID and authentication systems, now {{make it possible to}} require a biometrically associated number or mark to make purchases. They fear that the ability to implement such a system closely resembles the Number of the Beast prophesied in <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Revelation.</b>|$|E

5|$|It {{soon became}} {{evident that the}} Dominicans needed to {{reestablish}} themselves in Ciudad Real, and the hostilities with the colonists were calmed. In 1547, while de las Casas was in Spain, Francisco Marroquín, bishop of Guatemala, placed the first stone for the new Dominican convent in Ciudad Real. The Dominicans dedicated themselves to destroying indigenous temples and idols, and preached sermons with destructive imagery, such as from <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Revelation,</b> that were more familiar to the Mesoamerican worldview. Saints were associated with animals, {{in much the same}} way as the Indians identified themselves with nahual spirit-forms. Different Mesoamerican otherworlds were tied to Christian concepts, where the Mictlan world of the dead became Hell, Ihuicatl became Heaven, and Tlalocan became Paradise.|$|E
5|$|Manuscripts 1eap and 1rK Erasmus {{borrowed}} from Johannes Reuchlin. The {{rest of the}} manuscripts he {{borrowed from}} Dominicans. It is significant {{that he did not}} use the Codex Basilensis, which was held at the Basel University Library, and was available for him. Erasmus had three manuscripts of the Gospels and Acts, four manuscripts of the Pauline epistles, but only one manuscript with <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Revelation.</b> In every book of the New Testament he compared three or four manuscripts, except the last book, Book of Revelation. Unfortunately, this manuscript was not complete, it lacked the final leaf, which contained the last six verses of the book. Instead of delaying the publication, on account of the search for another manuscript, he decided to translate the missing verses from the Latin Vulgate into Greek. He used an inferior manuscript of Vulgate with textual variant libro vitae (book of life) instead ligno vitae (tree of life) in Rev 22:19. Even in other parts of <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Revelation</b> and other books of the New Testament Erasmus occasionally introduced self-created Greek text material taken from the Vulgate. F. H. A. Scrivener remarked, that in Rev 17:4 he created a new Greek word: ἀκαθαρτητος (instead τὰ ἀκάθαρτα). There is no such word in Greek language as ακαθαρτητος. In Rev 17:8 he used καιπερ εστιν (and yet is) instead of και παρεσται (and shall come). In Acts 9:6 the question that Paul asks {{at the time of his}} conversion on the Damascus road, Τρέμων τε καὶ θαμβὣν εἲπεν κύριε τί μέ θέλεις ποιῆσαι ("And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what will you have me to do?") was incorporated from the Vulgate.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{publication}} of his third edition, Erasmus had seen the Complutensian Polyglot, and used its text for improvement of his own text. In <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Revelation</b> he altered his fourth edition (1527) in about 90 passages {{on the basis of the}} Complutensian text. Unfortunately Erasmus had forgotten what places of the Apocalypse he translated from Latin and he did not correct all of them. Except in the Revelation, the fourth edition differed only in about 20 places from his third (according to Mill about 10 places). The fourth edition was printed in three parallel columns, they contain the Greek, Erasmus' own Latin version, and the Vulgate.|$|E

5|$|The main {{intention}} of the tour was to transform Madonna's old hits musically and display her capacity for transformation and self-reflection. The tour was initially known as the Whore of Babylon World Tour, although Madonna later denied using this name. The idea was to portray Madonna as the Whore of Babylon, the figure of evil as mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Revelation.</b> However it was later changed to the Re-Invention World Tour, {{to make it a}} self-confident dig at all the critics and people who have expressed their views about Madonna re-inventing her image over the years. The official tour poster displayed Madonna in a vintage bolero gown and a large French Renaissance-like hair-bun. Air-conditioning was turned off during the tour on Madonna's request as she claimed it dried up her throat during singing.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the stereotypical}} {{portrayal}} of television angels, Castiel {{does not always}} help people, {{and is willing to}} kill innocents if needed. Collins originally read for the part of a demon, as series creator Eric Kripke did not want fans to find out that angels were being introduced to the series. Collins prepared for the role by reading <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Revelation,</b> and based his portrayal on his younger brother. Critics and fans have responded highly favorably to the character. In response, the show's creators expanded his role in the series, upgrading him to a main cast member in the fifth and sixth seasons. After being a special guest star in the seventh and eighth seasons, Collins was upgraded once again to regular cast member status for the ninth, tenth and eleventh seasons.|$|E
5|$|Jesus for President {{is divided}} into four chapters, the first two of which {{summarize}} the Bible from a New Monastic perspective. The summary of the Old Testament argues that the Israelites had a unique political philosophy, but that they {{failed to live up}} to its implications. The New Testament summary considers Jesus' politics and the qualities of the Christian Church. The third chapter suggests implications of this narrative for citizens of the United States, who the authors describe as members of an empire similar to that of the Romans. This chapter argues that <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Revelation</b> has more to do with living faithfully in an evil empire than with eschatology. The chapter also asserts that Constantinianism had generally negative consequences for the Church. The fourth chapter tells of Christians living in countercultural ways that model divine redemption towards others. Other stories involve heterodox economics, defending the homeless, Amish forgiveness, dumpster diving, missional robotics, Martin Luther King Jr., anti-war protests, and The Simple Way.|$|E

5|$|The {{portion of}} the codex held by the British Library {{consists}} of 346½ folios, 694 pages (38.1cm x 34.5cm), constituting {{over half of the}} original work. Of these folios, 199 belong to the Old Testament, including the apocrypha (deuterocanonical), and 147½ belong to the New Testament, along with two other books, the Epistle of Barnabas and part of The Shepherd of Hermas. The apocryphal books present in the surviving part of the Septuagint are 2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, 1 and 4 Maccabees, Wisdom, and Sirach. The books of the New Testament are arranged in this order: the four Gospels, the epistles of Paul (Hebrews follows 2 Thess.), the Acts of the Apostles, the General Epistles, and <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Revelation.</b> The fact that some parts of the codex are preserved in good condition while others are in very poor condition implies they were separated and stored in several places.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{produced}} {{commentaries on}} most of the books of the Bible. His first commentary on Romans was published in 1540, and he planned to write commentaries on the entire New Testament. Six years passed before he wrote his second, a commentary on First Epistle to the Corinthians, but after that he devoted more attention to reaching his goal. Within four years he had published commentaries on all the Pauline epistles, and he also revised the commentary on Romans. He then {{turned his attention to the}} general epistles, dedicating them to Edward VI of England. By 1555 he had completed his work on the New Testament, finishing with the Acts and the Gospels (he omitted only the brief second and third Epistles of John and <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Revelation).</b> For the Old Testament, he wrote commentaries on Isaiah, the books of the Pentateuch, the Psalms, and Joshua. The material for the commentaries often originated from lectures to students and ministers that he reworked for publication. From 1557 onwards, he could not find the time to continue this method, and he gave permission for his lectures to be published from stenographers' notes. These Praelectiones covered the minor prophets, Daniel, Jeremiah, Lamentations, and part of Ezekiel.|$|E
