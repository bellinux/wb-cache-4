5|$|In 1862, ex-Sultan of Riau-Lingga, Sultan Mahmud IV Muzaffar Shah went to Terengganu from Bangkok on a Siamese vessel. The British {{requested}} that the ex-Sultan to be withdrawn because the British accused the ex-Sultan and also the Sultan of Terengganu, Sultan Omar of supporting Wan Ahmad. Wan Ahmad had constantly attacked Pahang using Kemaman as his base and British trade there were disrupted by the constant attacks. The Siamese agreed to British request, but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> follow through with their agreement. The Strait Settlements Governor, Sir Orfeur Cavenagh sent three ships, HMS Scout, HMS Coquette and a steamer Tonze to Kuala Terengganu, {{under the command of}} Captain Corbett, accompanied by Major MacPherson. They were sent with orders to compel the ex-Sultan of Riau-Lingga to be sent back by the British to Siam, and to call upon the Sultan to cease supporting Wan Ahmad. After the Sultan of Terengganu declined to surrender the ex-Sultan to the British, the ships bombarded Kuala Terengganu. The Sultan of Terengganu and the ex-Sultan had fled Kuala Terengganu during the bombardment. The ships then returned to Singapore. Kuala Terengganu was ravaged by a fire in 1882. The fire that swept through Kuala Terengganu destroyed many buildings, including Green Palace (Istana Hijau), the Sultan’s palace. Maziah Palace (Istana Maziah) was later built to replace the destroyed palace.|$|E

25|$|This LTM availability/accessibility {{dichotomy}} {{is analogous}} to a more contemporary explanation of Plato's doctrine of reminiscence, which postulates that an individual hedge {{as a result of}} information carried over from past lives. While evidence for or against immortality is outside the bounds of scientific research, one can see similarities between LTM availability/accessibility and the doctrine of reminiscence. LTM availability is highly unrestricted and practically unlimited as a storage system while LTM accessibility corresponds to what we can actually recall at any given moment. Plato, through his doctrine of reminiscence, would say that knowledge available through reminiscence is practically unrestricted but we are not cognizant of many of those ideas because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> be recalled.|$|E
25|$|There {{are about}} 4,000 Karaites {{living in the}} United States. The Congregation B'nai Israel is located in Daly City, California, which is a suburb of San Francisco.

The congregation's acting Rav (Ḥakham), Joe Pessah, was also among those who were arrested by the Egyptian government.

Ryan noted that many Let's Play videos, gathering {{more than a million}} views, of That Dragon, Cancer had simply played through the game without commenting on it or providing viewers with links and information about the game, giving viewers no incentive to purchase the title once they had seen it in its entirety. Numinous Games used YouTube's ContentID system to flag and take down some of these videos, leading some players to complain and which Ryan admitted was not the best approach towards addressing the issue. Ryan felt that they would be satisfied if these viewers had left small tips on Numinous Games' website in lieu of purchasing the game, so that Numinous could continue to develop more titles.|$|E

Little and his team reported the discovery of an entire second layer of square-cut rocks with similar dimensions beneath the stones of the Bimini Road. However, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> formally publish in any detail the evidence and observations that demonstrate the presence of this underlying layer and the square-cut nature of its blocks.

He has also published an informal critique of Shinn's Skeptical Inquirer article.

25|$|Leeds United, {{the last}} champions of English {{football}} before {{the creation of}} the Premier League, played in the first 12 seasons of the Premier League, peaking at third place in 2000, before being relegated in 2004 {{in the midst of a}} serious financial crisis which was the direct result of heavy spending on players in the previous few seasons and a failure to net the extra revenue that successful challenges for domestic and European silverware would have brought them. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> return to the Premier League more than a decade later, and even spent three seasons in the league's third tier. A spectacular decline in similar circumstances also befell Portsmouth, who reached the Premier League in 2003 and stayed there for seven seasons, lifting the FA Cup in 2008. The South Coast club were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2009–10 season, having become the first club at this level to enter administration, and were deducted nine points at a result. In 2013, a third relegation in four seasons saw them relegated to the league's fourth tier for the first time in 35 years.|$|E
25|$|Fred Trueman (0/59) gave Bobby Simpson and Bill Lawry a torrid time, {{his first}} ball to Simpson rolled onto the stumps, {{but failed to}} {{dislodge}} the bail and they survived the day with 16/0. They moved along to 104 by lunch, but not without a few scares. Brian Statham missed a simple caught and bowled off Simpson and Trueman's strong left arm nearly had Lawry run out while backing up. Simpson had made 109, 66 not out, 28, 122, 130, 9, 110 and 50 {{so far in the}} season and looked tired when he edged Ted Dexter (2/78) behind to the vigilant England wicket-keeper Alan Smith for 71 in a stand of 136. Norm O'Neill came in and promptly drove Dexter for 4, then hooked him for another. He took a boundary off Barry Knight and even Lawry joined in the act, hooking Statham to the boundary as they added 80 runs in 79 minutes. Knight was reduced to bowling down the leg-side without a slip and O'Neill hooked to the boundary and smashed him over mid-on, which even brought applause from Dexter. Lawry moved smoothly to 98 then hooked a long hop from Fred Titmus (1/81) into the hands of David Sheppard in the deep. Neil Harvey came out to attack the bowling - he rarely did anything else - and the runs flowed regardless of Dexter's attempts to plug the gaps. O'Neill was out to a beautiful ball from Statham (1/67) that cut back and had him lbw for 56 with 9 fours and Harvey's 57 with 6 fours ended when he tried to hit Dexter out of the ground and was caught by Statham at deep mid-off. Peter Burge (47 not out) had kept Harvey company in a stand of 84, and added 37 runs with Brian Booth (19 not out) in the last half hour and Australia were 362/4, 377 runs ahead {{by the end of the}} fourth day. Benaud's decision to not declare and have a bowl that evening was criticised by the press and several theories were advanced as to why. Some thought he was playing mind-games with the English batsmen, giving them an uncertain and nervous night, others that he was afraid of Dexter's batting power. A more likely explanation was that Benaud had suffered a groin strain after his 42 over marathon in the first innings and he didn't want to declare until he knew he would be fit on the last day. In any case after inspecting the wicket with Neil Harvey and bowling a few balls in front of the pavilion he declared ten minutes before play started. England were given 378 runs to win, a total that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> make in a fourth innings against Australia.|$|E
