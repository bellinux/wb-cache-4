5|$|In February 1998, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ricardo Torres {{dismissed}} Coppola's claim. Although Torres {{agreed that}} Sagan violated some {{terms of the}} contract, he explained that Coppola waited too long to file his lawsuit, and that the contract might not be enforceable as it was written. Coppola then appealed his suit, <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> California Courts of Appeal (CCA). In April 2000, the CCA dismissed his suit, finding that Coppola’s claims were barred because they were brought too late. The court noted {{that it was not}} until 1994 that the filmmaker thought about suing over Contact.|$|E
5|$|Mathilde's orbit is eccentric, <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outer {{reaches of}} the main belt. Nonetheless, the orbit lies entirely between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter; it does not cross the {{planetary}} orbits. It also {{has one of the}} slowest rotation periods of the known asteroidsmost asteroids have a rotation period in the range of 224 hours. Because of the slow rotation rate, NEAR Shoemaker was only able to photograph 60% of the asteroid's surface. The slow rate of rotation may be accounted for by a satellite orbiting the asteroid, but a search of the NEAR images revealed none larger than 10km in diameter out to 20 times the radius of Mathilde.|$|E
5|$|Yugoslavia's socialist {{government}} suppressed or discouraged public religious celebrations {{until the}} early 1990s. Since then, the Serbian Orthodox Church has, together with local communities, organized public celebrations on Christmas Eve. There are typically three elements to such celebrations: the preparation, the ritual, and the festivity. The preparation consists of cutting down the oak sapling {{to be used as}} the badnjak, <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> church yard, and preparing drink and food for the assembled parishioners. The ritual includes Vespers, placing the badnjak on the open fire built in the church yard, blessing or consecrating the badnjak, and an appropriate program with songs and recitals. In some parishes they build the fire on which to burn the badnjak not in the church yard but at some other suitable location in their town or village. The festivity consists of gathering around the fire and socializing. Each particular celebration has its own specific traits however, reflecting the traditions of the local community.|$|E

25|$|Kcne2-/- mice exhibit achlorhydria, gastric hyperplasia, and mis-trafficking of KCNQ1 to the parietal cell basal membrane. The mis-trafficking {{occurs because}} KCNE3 is {{upregulated}} in the parietal cells of Kcne2-/- mice, and hijacks KCNQ1, <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> basolateral membrane. When both Kcne2 and Kcne3 are germline-deleted in mice, KCNQ1 traffics to the parietal cell apical membrane but the gastric phenotype {{is even worse}} than for Kcne2-/- mice, emphasizing that KCNQ1 requires KCNE2 co-assembly for functional attributes other than targeting in parietal cells. Kcne2-/- mice also develop gastritis cystica profunda and gastric neoplasia. Human KCNE2 downregulation is also observed in sites of gastritis cystica profunda and gastric adenocarcinoma.|$|E

25|$|Route of the E59 {{starts in}} Prague, Czech Republic, and {{proceeds}} southeast along the D1 motorway towards Jihlava, where {{it leaves the}} motorway and turns south along the route 38, a regular road comprising at-grade intersections. The route passes near Moravské Budějovice and Znojmo. It crosses from the Czech Republic to Austria between Chvalovice and Haugsdorf as it switches to Austrian B303 state road, representing another two-lane road with at-grade intersections. South of Hollabrunn, the E59 transfers to the S3 expressway until it reaches Stockerau and the A22 which carries the E59 east to Vienna. Within the city, the E59 turns south once again in Donaustadt, transferring to the A23 <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southern outskirts of the city. There it proceeds further south along the A2 motorway taking the route past Wiener Neustadt {{to the city of}} Graz. Graz itself is bypassed by the motorway and the E59 switches there to the A9 motorway marking the final southbound leg of the E59 through Austria until it reaches Spielfeld/Šentilj border crossing to Slovenia. South of the border crossing the E59 route follows the Slovenian A1 motorway to the south of Maribor where the E59 leaves the A1 route and joins the A4 towards Ptuj. At Draženci near Ptuj, the route defaults to route 9, another two-lane road comprising at-grade intersections, taking it to Gruškovje/Macelj border crossing to Croatia. South of the border, the E59 follows Croatian A2 motorway running past Krapina to Zagreb. The E59 terminates at Jankomir interchange of the Zagreb bypass, where southbound E59 traffic defaults to the eastbound A3 motorway. Originally the E59 extended further south past Zagreb, to Bihać, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Split at the Adriatic Sea coast, however, that segment of the route was subsequently transferred to the European route E71. Nonetheless, the E59 shares segments of the route with a number of other European routes. A part of the E59 spanning Prague and Vienna corresponds to the Pan-European Corridor IV, and the segment spanning Graz and Zagreb corresponds to the Pan-European Corridor Xa.|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} argued that Wittgenstein's response, unlike either Moore's or Wright's, is <b>the</b> right answer <b>to</b> scepticism about <b>the</b> {{existence}} of an external world.

As <b>it</b> fails <b>to</b> address <b>the</b> intuitions which give rise <b>to</b> scepticism, however, <b>it</b> seems merely dogmatic. Wright's more detailed argument invokes a principle to delineate factual from non-factual claims and thereby turns the sceptical argument on itself, but depends on our accepting this fundamental epistemological principle as a convention, which the sceptic need not. Wittgenstein declines <b>to</b> legitimate <b>the</b> sceptic by arguing with her, but presupposes that she has made a mistake.
