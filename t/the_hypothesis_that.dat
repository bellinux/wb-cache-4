5|$|The {{first of}} these {{planetary}} rings was detected in 1968 by {{a team led by}} Edward Guinan. In the early 1980s, analysis of this data along with newer observations led to <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>that</b> this ring might be incomplete.|$|E

5|$|Although {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} a biped, {{it has been suggested}} since the mid-1970s that Spinosaurus was at least an occasional quadruped.

Analyzing current use of the Internet by unions in the United Kingdom and United States, we develop five <b>hypothesis</b> about <b>the</b> impact of the Internet on unions. 1) <b>the</b> Customized Services <b>hypothesis</b> <b>that</b> unions will individualize services; 2) <b>the</b> Cyber-organizing <b>hypothesis</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Web will ease organization and produce virtual minority unions at many non-union firms; 3) <b>the</b> Cyber-democracy <b>hypothesis</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Web will enhance democracy in unions; 4) <b>the</b> Cyber-dispute <b>hypothesis</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Web will become an important space for industrial disputes; and 5) <b>the</b> New Internationalism <b>hypothesis</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Web will strengthen the international labor community.

5|$|Bates {{put forward}} <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>that</b> the close {{resemblance}} between unrelated species was an antipredator adaptation.

He reasoned that these butterflies were unpalatable to birds and other insectivores, and were thus avoided by them. He extended this logic to forms that closely resembled such protected species, mimicking their warning coloration but not their toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Histological {{examination}} {{reveals that}} pachycephalosaurid domes {{are composed of}} a unique form of fibrolamellar bone which contains fibroblasts that {{play a critical role}} in wound healing, and are capable of rapidly depositing bone during remodeling. Peterson et al. (2013) concluded that taken together, the frequency of lesion distribution and the bone structure of frontoparietal domes, lends strong support to <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>that</b> pachycephalosaurids used their unique cranial structures for agonistic behavior. CT scan comparisons of the skulls of Stegoceras validum, Prenocephale prenes, and several head-striking artiodactyls have also supported pachycephalosaurids as being well-equipped for head-butting.|$|E

40|$|Our {{research}} {{explored the}} incidence and {{appropriateness of the}} much-maligned confirmatory approach to testing scientific hypotheses. Psychological scientists completed a survey about their research goals and strategies.

As expected, few scientists reported testing universal hypotheses. Most indicated an inclination to use a confirmation strategy to test <b>the</b> non-absolute <b>hypotheses</b> <b>that</b> a particular relation sometimes occurs or sometimes does not occur, and a disconfirmation strategy to test <b>the</b> absolute <b>hypotheses</b> <b>that</b> a particular relation always occurs or never occurs. The confirmatory search that dominates the field {{was found to be}} associated with the testing of non-absolute hypotheses. Our analysis indicates that a confirmatory approach is the normatively correct test of <b>the</b> non-absolute <b>hypotheses</b> <b>that</b> are <b>the</b> starting point of most studies.
