500|$|Etna {{served in}} the Squadra Permamente (Permanent Squadron) from her {{commissioning}} to 1893 and then served in North and South American waters {{until the end of}} 1895. From April to June 1893, she participated in the International Naval Review at Hampton Roads {{that was part of the}} Columbian Exposition. Afterward she was stationed in the Red Sea during the First Italo-Ethiopian War of 1895–6 and then supported Italian interests during the Cretan Revolt of 1898. The ship was then transferred to the Far East, returning home in 1902. Etna was disarmed that same year and she was flagship of the Superior Torpedo-Boat Command in 1904. The ship was rebuilt between 1905 and 1907, her superstructure was enlarged and she was given two [...] guns, one each fore and aft, as well as four 6-inch guns in her waist, <b>two</b> <b>per</b> <b>side.</b> In 1909 she participated in the Hudson-Fulton Celebration along with the cruiser [...] She served as a training ship after her rebuild until the start of World War I when she became the stationary flagship of the Commander-in-Chief in Taranto for the duration of the war. Etna was disarmed again in 1920 and sold for scrap in 1921.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standardized}} [...] round {{sealed beam}} headlamp, one per side, {{was required for}} all vehicles sold in the United States from 1940, virtually freezing usable lighting technology in place until the 1970s, for Americans.

2500|$|Hurricane Mk IIA Series 1 {{equipped}} with new and slightly longer propeller spinner, and fully replaced the machine-gun armament with four 20mm (.79in) Hispano Mk II cannons, <b>two</b> <b>per</b> <b>side.</b> Hurricane IIA Series 2 became the Mk IIC in June 1941, using a slightly modified wing. The new wings {{also included a}} hardpoint for a [...] bomb and, later in 1941, fuel tanks. By then performance was inferior to the latest German fighters, and the Hurricane changed to the ground-attack role, {{sometimes referred to as}} the Hurribomber. The mark also served as a night fighter and intruder.|$|E

2500|$|The French {{placed a}} number of spare Mle 1893 guns on four-axle {{railroad}} carriages in 1915 to use as mobile heavy artillery. The mount with its gun weighed [...] and was [...] long. It could traverse a full 360° if its outriggers, <b>two</b> <b>per</b> <b>side,</b> were deployed. Photographic evidence shows that some mounts had built-up cargo compartments {{at both ends of}} the mount, which limited the gun's firing arc to approximately 90° on each side. It had a circular platform for the crew that had to be folded up for travel. Some guns were fitted with gun shields. It shared its railroad carriage with the 164mm Mle 1893/96 M and the Canon de 194 mm 1870/93.|$|E
2500|$|ERA-3B: Eight RA-3Bs {{converted}} as electronic aggressor aircraft (primarily for war-at sea exercises) with ECM in new extended tail cone, ventral [...] "canoe" [...] fairing, cylindrical fairing atop vertical fin, and two detachable {{ram-air turbine}} powered ALQ-76 countermeasures pods (one under each wing). Added chaff (radar countermeasure) dispensers (streaming chaff from the tail cone and two self-protection chaff dispensers on the aft fuselage) and four ram-air turbines (<b>two</b> <b>per</b> <b>side)</b> {{to power the}} equipment located in the former bomb bay. Crew increased to four: pilot, navigator, crew chief, and Electronic Countermeasures Officer (ECMO) with one generally unused [...] "jumpseat" [...] in the aft crew compartment (formerly the weapon bay). There was no equipment position for a second Electronic Countermeasures Officer or enlisted crewman in the converted weapon bay. The [...] "jump seat" [...] was used for qualified instructor ECMOs training new ECMOs, for guest observers on operational flights, or for passengers during operational deployment transits. While the ERA-3B could withstand the stresses of a cable arrested landing, the ALT-40 and ALR-75 equipment in the former bomb bay was not stressed to withstand a catapult launch and the ERA-3B was never deployed aboard carriers. The ERA-3B served with VAQ-33 and later with VAQ-34.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{differences}} between baseball and Test cricket is the primary intent of the batsman. Usually, in Test/First Class cricket, wickets come at a far higher premium, since survival is of primary importance. While nine innings per side are played in a baseball game within a few hours, only <b>two</b> <b>per</b> <b>side</b> are played in Test cricket over five days (thirty hours), so {{the cost of a}} dismissal is far higher in cricket. It should be kept in mind that a batsman in cricket is not obligated to take a run after striking the ball, nor is there any penalty for swinging at the ball and missing unless it hits the stumps (i.e. the wicket) (or, as often happens, makes a glancing contact with the bat and is caught) and there is no limit to the number of deliveries a batsman can face; a batsman with the required concentration, determination and technical ability often bats for several hours (occasionally days) without being dismissed. By contrast, in baseball a batter takes a serious penalty (a [...] "strike") if he swings and misses: three strikes result in an out, and if the batter hits he must run. This contrast means that in cricket, unlike baseball, the quality of a batsman's defensive game and footwork (unlike baseball batters, cricket batsmen are not required to keep their back foot grounded when hitting the ball) are of the utmost importance. The nuances of batting technique are also greater in cricket, since the interplays between bowling variations, field placements and scoring strengths are more dynamic. Since cricket is played over an extended duration, the bowler and the fielding captain have time to [...] "work over" [...] a batsman (e.g. trying several different bowlers). Thus, cricket batting requires a very tight technique and the ability to withstand sustained examinations.|$|E
50|$|When used on {{the common}} mounting, the Sd.Kfz. 251 halftrack, a frame with six base plates were used, with three on each side. The Chenillette UE {{employed}} either <b>two</b> <b>per</b> <b>side</b> or four frames on the rear. The Hotchkiss H35 mounting used <b>two</b> <b>per</b> <b>side</b> also. Some captured American M3 halftracks also mounted Wurfrahmen, with four frames at <b>two</b> <b>per</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E

50|$|Chaley first {{presented}} {{a proposal for}} the Grand Pont Suspendu in February 1830, and was awarded the contract in June of that year. His estimated cost of less than 300,000 florins was well below other competitors, including Guillaume Henri Dufour. Chaley's bridge was supported on four main cables (<b>two</b> <b>per</b> <b>side),</b> each consisting of 1056 wires each 3.08mm in diameter. It carried 2000 people on its opening day.

The other four screens, <b>two</b> <b>per</b> <b>side,</b> were installed within the PIT 3. Special effects were produced by 2,100 light points and 140 lasers.
