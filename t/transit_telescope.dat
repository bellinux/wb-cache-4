5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} <b>Transit</b> <b>Telescope</b> at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio {{telescope}} that could only point directly upwards; {{the next logical step}} was to build a telescope that could look at all parts of the sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the <b>Transit</b> <b>Telescope</b> had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E
5|$|The {{east and}} west wings of the {{building}} once each contained a transit room. Each of the rooms had a mounted <b>transit</b> <b>telescope</b> on a brick pier; the piers are still visible in the basement below the transit rooms. The western transit rooms were converted into office space by the 1920s. The eastern transit rooms were converted to office space more recently.|$|E
5|$|Interferometry at Jodrell Bank started {{before the}} Lovell {{telescope}} was constructed, using the <b>Transit</b> <b>Telescope</b> with a 35 square meter broadside array {{to determine the}} size of radio-loud nebulae. Once construction of the Lovell telescope was complete, the broadside array was put on a steerable mount and the pair were used as a tracking radio interferometer. This was then {{used to determine the}} 2D shape of quasars on the sky.Rowson (1963) In the summer of 1961, a 25-foot (8-m) diameter paraboloid telescope was constructed (it was made of aluminium tubing and was mounted on the rotating structure of an old defence radar). This was then used as a steerable interferometer with the Mark I, with a resolution of 0.3 arcseconds, to determine the sizes of some high-redshift (z~0.86) quasars.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{there were}} three other smaller <b>transit</b> <b>telescopes,</b> two clocks by Clemens Riefler of Munich, and other accessories including sextants, chronometers, and teaching tools.|$|R
50|$|Sextants for astronomical {{observations}} were devices depicting a sixth of a circle, used primarily {{for measuring the}} positions of stars. They are of significant historical importance, but have been replaced over time by <b>transit</b> <b>telescopes,</b> astrometry techniques, and satellites such as Hipparcos.|$|R
50|$|Sometime around 1810 {{he decided}} to {{fabricate}} surveying instruments, selling chains, compasses, and small <b>transit</b> <b>telescopes.</b> He also fabricated for sale magnets, electrical apparatus and leveling instruments. He was quite successful in the surveying trade, however left it in 1825 and went into civil engineering.|$|R
5|$|Astronomy {{classes at}} the University of Illinois date to its {{earliest}} days. The first courses focused on measurement {{of the night sky}} and was taken by civil engineering students to sharpen their surveying skills. A small observatory consisting of a 4-inch refractor and a small <b>transit</b> <b>telescope</b> was constructed by 1872. The astronomy courses were typically taught by the mathematics department and by the early 1890s, several mathematics instructors wanted to do more with astronomy. An expanded astronomy curriculum would require a new larger facility. The Illinois state legislature voted in 1895 to fund a new teaching observatory at the University of Illinois, providing $15,000 for construction. The site chosen was a grass knoll between Matthews Avenue and Burrill Avenue, just north of the Morrow Plots, a National Historic Landmark that is the nation's oldest experimental field. Contracts were extended to Charles A. Gunn, the architect and an instructor on campus, and Bevis and Company in Urbana as the general contractor with construction beginning in April 1896. The building was completed by August at a total cost of $6,800. The principle telescope was installed in November and the final telescope was in place by February 1897.|$|E
25|$|Langley {{arrived in}} Pittsburgh in 1867 {{to become the}} first {{director}} of the Allegheny Observatory, after the institution had fallen into hard times and been given to the Western University of Pennsylvania. By then, the department was in disarray – equipment was broken, there was no library and the building needed repairs. Through the friendship and aid of William Thaw, a Pittsburgh industrial leader, Langley was able to improve the observatory equipment and build additional apparatuses. One of the new instruments was a small <b>transit</b> <b>telescope</b> used to observe the position of the stars as they cross the celestial meridian. He raised money for the department in large part by distributing standard time to cities and railroads. Up until then, correct time had only occasionally been sent from American observatories for public use. Clocks were manually wound in those days and time tended to be imprecise. Exact time had not been especially necessary. It was enough to know that at noon the sun was directly above the head. All that until railroad tracks were installed.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Transit</b> <b>Telescope</b> was a [...] {{parabolic}} reflector zenith telescope built at Jodrell Bank in 1947. At the time, {{it was the}} largest radio telescope in the world. It consisted of a wire mesh suspended from a ring of [...] scaffold poles, which focussed radio signals to a focal point [...] above the ground. The telescope mainly looked directly upwards, but the direction of the beam could be changed by small amounts by tilting the mast to change the position of the focal point. The focal mast was originally going to be wood, but this was changed to a steel mast before construction was complete. The telescope was replaced by the fully steerable [...] Lovell Telescope, and the Mark II telescope was subsequently built on the same location.|$|E
50|$|The {{observatory}} {{also contains}} several <b>transit</b> <b>telescopes,</b> zenith scopes, and other antique astronomical instruments used by Civil Engineers {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries for geodesy and timekeeping.

500|$|The {{university}} {{decided that}} it was time to increase the size of the department and hired Dr. George C. McVittie as the next director. After his arrival in the fall of 1952, McVittie began the refurbishment of the Observatory's major instruments. [...] The 12-inch refractor and the 3-inch <b>transit</b> <b>telescope</b> were restored in 1954 by J.W. Fecker Company. He also began expanding the faculty. Dr. Stanley Wyatt joined the faculty in 1953, George Swenson and Ivan King in 1956, Kennth Yoss, John Dickel and James Kaler in 1964 and Edward Olson in 1966. With George Swenson's arrival, Illinois began a program of radio astronomy resulting in the Vermillion River Radio Observatory that opened in 1962. Prairie Observatory was an optical observatory consisting of a 40-inch telescope and was completed in 1967. By the time of Dr. McVittie's retirement in 1971, the one-astronomer department had expanded to nine faculty with research interests in relativity, cosmology, celestial mechanics, perturbation theory, dynamics of star clusters, planetary nebulae, planets, supernovae and radio astronomy. [...] The department which produced only five advanced degrees prior to 1951 graduated 29 Masters and 14 Doctoral student during the McVittie administration.|$|E
2500|$|The Mark II is a radio {{telescope}} located at Jodrell Bank Observatory, near Goostrey, Cheshire, in the north-west of England. It {{was built on}} the site of the 218ft (66.4m) <b>Transit</b> <b>Telescope.</b> Construction was completed in 1964.

2500|$|The {{observatory}} is a sandstone {{building in}} the Italianate style. [...] There are two telescope domes on octagonal bases and a four-storey tower for the time-ball. [...] The 1858 building designed by the Colonial Architect, Alexander Dawson, comprised a dome to house the equatorial telescope, a room with long, narrow windows for the <b>transit</b> <b>telescope,</b> an office for calculations, and a residence for the astronomer. A western wing was added in 1877 with office and library space and a second dome for another telescope. [...] Some of the first astronomical photographs of the southern sky were taken at the observatory, {{under the direction of}} Henry Chamberlain Russell. [...] The observatory also took part in the compilation of the first atlas of the whole sky, The astrographic catalogue. [...] The part completed at Sydney took over 70 years, from 1899 to 1971, and filled 53 volumes.|$|E
50|$|Taylor was {{appointed}} {{director of the}} East India Company's observatory at Madras, arriving there on 15 September 1830. He brought with him new equipment including <b>transit</b> <b>telescopes</b> and a mural circle. He worked with four Indian assistants, who took observations {{when he went to}} join the Great Trigonometrical Survey. Taylor collaborated with John Caldecott of the Travancore observatory to make observations on the magnetic field, especially the magnetic equator, of the earth around 1837.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>transit</b> <b>telescopes</b> use a {{basin of}} mercury {{to form a}} flat and {{absolutely}} horizontal mirror, useful in determining an absolute vertical or perpendicular reference. Concave horizontal parabolic mirrors may be formed by rotating liquid mercury on a disk, the parabolic form of the liquid thus formed reflecting and focusing incident light. Such telescopes are cheaper than conventional large mirror telescopes by up to a factor of 100, but the mirror cannot be tilted and always points straight up.|$|R
50|$|Transit mounts {{are single}} axis mounts fixed in azimuth while {{rotating}} in altitude, usually oriented on a north-south axis. This allows the telescope {{to view the}} whole sky, but only when the Earth's rotation allows the objects to cross (transit) through that narrow north-south line (the meridian). This type of mount is used in <b>Transit</b> <b>telescopes,</b> designed for precision astronomical measurement. Transit mounts are also used to save on cost or where the instruments mass makes movement {{on more than one}} axis very difficult, such as large radio telescopes.|$|R

40|$|Over {{a century}} ago, astronomers using <b>transit</b> <b>telescopes</b> to {{determine}} precise stellar positions were hampered by an unexplained periodic shifting {{of the stars}} they were observing. With the advent of CCD <b>transit</b> <b>telescopes</b> {{in the past three}} decades, this unexplained motion, now known as “anomalous refraction,” is again being observed. Anomalous refraction is described as a low frequency, large angular scale motion of the entire image plane with respect to the celestial coordinate system as observed and defined by previous astrometric catalogs. These motions of typically several tenths of an arcsecond with timescales on the order of ten minutes are ubiquitous to drift-scan groundbased astrometric measurements regardless of location or telescopes used and have been attributed to the effect of tilting of equal-density layers of the atmosphere. The cause of this tilting has often been attributed to atmospheric gravity waves, but never confirmed. Although theoretical models of atmospheric refraction show that atmospheric gravity waves are a plausible cause of anomalous refraction, an observational campaign specifically directed at defining this relationship provides clear evidence that anomalous refraction is not consistent with the passage of atmospheric gravity waves. The source of anomalous refraction is found to be meter scale slowly evolving coherent dynamical structures in the boundary-layer below 60 meters. PhysicsDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

By 1840 he felt he had come to a suitable design using shadows, however when he communicated his ideas to Mr J.M. Bloxam (a barrister), he found he had also been working on his own design using reflections, which Dent felt was superior. The two formed a partnership and worked together on the device, and after a further 2 years work they finalised the design and patented it (GB Patent 9793 of 1843), with Mr Dent manufacturing and selling it as Dent's Dipleidoscope. The instrument could use the moon as well as the sun and when correctly calibrated and aligned the accuracy was said to be less than a second.
