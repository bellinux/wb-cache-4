The rise in demand for polypropylene has encouraged the growth of the DCCU, which is operated very much like an FCCU.

40|$|Abstract I Widespread use of fuel oxygenates, {{coupled with}} their high water {{solubility}} and slow degradation rate, {{have led to}} an increase in the potential for human exposure. We developed an accurate, precise, sensitive, and high-throughput analytical method to simultaneously quantify trace levels (low parts-per-trillion) of four fuel oxygenates in human blood: methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), di-isopropyl ether (DIPE), and <b>tert-amyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> (TAME). The analytes were extracted from the head space above human blood samples, using solid-phase microextraction, desorbed into the heated injector, and chromatographically resolved by capillary gas chromatography.

Bare alumina, the support of perfluorinated acid, did not show any catalytic activity. This paper is also an attempt to propose the mechanism of ozone reactions with the ethers studied with or without the catalyst.

40|$|Experiments for the {{determination}} of vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data with a Non-Recycle Flow Still (NFS) are described. Due to short residence times, the NFS is especially suited for systems with thermally unstable components and for reactive mixtures. VLE data of the latter are necessary for modeling reactive distillation processes. With the NFS isobaric data both at atmospheric and at reduced pressure can be gained. The potential of this technique is demonstrated and validated with the well-known, non-reactive systems methanol-ethanol and ethanol-water. The other (mainly reactive) binary mixtures investigated stem from two esterification systems (methyl formate and ethyl acetate production) and one etherification system (<b>tert-amyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> production). The NRTL equation is used for modeling of the VLE data. The data acquired with the NFS are compared with literature data (whenever possible) or with results of group contribution methods. (orig.)

40|$|Interaction of the amido/bis(phosphine) -supported (PNP) Ir {{fragment}} with {{a series}} of linear and cyclic ethers is shown to afford, depending on substrate, products of α,α-dehydrogenation (carbenes), α,β-dehydrogenation (vinyl ethers), or decarbonylation. While carbenes are exclusively obtained from <b>tert-amyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether,</b> sec-butyl methyl ether (SBME), n-butyl methyl ether (NBME), and tetrahydrofuran (THF), vinyl ethers or their adducts are observed upon reaction with diethyl ether and 1, 4 -dioxane. Decarbonylation occurs upon interaction of (PNP) Ir with benzyl methyl ether, and a mechanism is proposed for this unusual transformation, which occurs via a series of C−H, C−O, and C−C bond cleavage events. The intermediates characterized for several of these reactions as well as the α,α-dehydrogenation of tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE) are used to outline a reaction pathway for the generation of PNP-supported iridium(I) carbene complexes, and it is shown that the long-lived, observable intermediates are substrate-dependent and differ for the related cases of MTBE and THF. Taken together, these findings highlight the variety of pathways utilized by the electron-rich, unsaturated (PNP) Ir fragment to stabilize itself by transferring electron density to ethereal substrates through oxidative addition and/or the formation of π-acidic ligands...|$|E

40|$|The {{toxicology}} of CO is {{very well}} known to alter oxygen saturation in red blood cells, but only at concentrations that are far above those observed in England during the time period 1996 – 2004. Exposure to CO at the current criterion concentration (9 ppm) pro-duces carboxyhaemoglobin of only about 1. 4 – 2. 0 %, which is clinically insignificant. Hence, I find it less than plausible that the very low ambient levels of CO in England could be the direct cause of so many deaths from respiratory disease. I can present an alternative hypothesis to explain these pollutant–mortality correla-tions. I have argued 3 {{that the use of}} methyl ether (such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) or <b>tert-amyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> (TAME)) in gasoline creates MN in the exhaust. As CO is primarily an engine exhaust product, increased CO would be expected to be strongly correlated with MN exhaust.

The effect of catalyst swelling was studied with several mixtures of reagents (MeOH and IA) and product (TAME) on Amberlyst 16. The particle size influenced the steady state reaction rates most notably at higher temperatures and with substoichiometric feed of the reagents (methanol/isoamylenes), i. e. when the reaction rate should be fast. The estimated effectiveness factors (0. 5 – 1. 0) decreased with increasing particle size and increasing temperature. At nonstoichiometric feed ratios of the reagents {{the value of the}} estimated effectiveness factor decreased more when methanol was fed in excess. Recalculations of the earlier results of TAME-synthesis demonstrated that when modifying the rate constants obtained from the batch reactor experiments by dividing them by the effectiveness factors, the R-squared values of the regression analysis against temperature increased (improved fit for Arrhenius-type dependency) and the activation energies increased by about 9 kJ mol− 1...|$|E
30|$|High {{viscosity}} at reservoir {{conditions is}} a major setback to heavy crude oil and bitumen recovery and transportation via pipelines. Thus, blending or dilution of heavy crude oil and bitumen to reduce viscosity {{is one of the}} several means to improve transportation via pipelines that is a most commonly used technique in the petroleum industry since the 1930 s. The blending fluid or diluents is always less viscous than the heavy crude and bitumen. Generally, it well know that the lower the viscosity of the diluents, the lower is the viscosity of the blended mixture of heavy crude and bitumen (Gateau et al. 2004). The widely used diluents include condensate from natural gas production, naphtha, kerosene, lighter crude oils, etc. However, the use of organic solvents such as alcohol, methyl tert-butyl ether, <b>tert-amyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> has been investigated (Anhorn and Badakhshan 1994). The use of these solvents is prompted based on their use in improving the octane number of gasoline. Subsequently, a mixture of hydrocarbons and organic solvents with polar group in their molecular structure has shown some effectiveness in viscosity reduction of heavy crude oil at constant dilution rate (Gateau et al. 2004). The use of diluents allows the transportation of large quantity or volume of heavy crude oil and bitumen.|$|E

Inhalation is a major route for human exposure to MTBE and other gasoline ethers. The possible adverse effects of MTBE in humans are a public concern {{and some of the}} reported symptoms attributed to MTBE exposure appear to be related to olfactory sensation. In the present study, we have demonstrated that the olfactory mucosa of the male Sprague-Dawley rat possesses the highest microsomal activities, among the tissues examined, in me-tabolizing MTBE, ETBE, and TAME.

This is for technological reasons (solvent removal, product drying), although {{on the assumption that}} solvent distillation is necessary, which may not always be the case. Although a perfectly valid concern it does mean that glycerol and other benign solvents appear to be environmentally damaging. In addition to a number of green alcohols and esters (including the bifunctional ethyl lactate), <b>tert-amyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> (TAME) has been identified as an amenable replacement for less desirable ether solvents.

Despite being considered as ‘problematic’, p-cymene has no red shaded scores, and as a renewable hydrocarbon is well placed to substitute toluene and other aromatic solvents [79 – 84]. Cyclic carbonates [70, 85], and Cyrene [69], suffer in the environmental assessment because of their high boiling points, but offer clear health advantages over classical dipolar aprotic solvents (Fig.  13).
