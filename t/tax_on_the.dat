5|$|The {{measures}} of taxation in {{the reign of}} Augustus were determined by population census, with fixed quotas for each province. Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes, while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces. Indirect taxes included a 4% <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> price of slaves, a 1% tax on goods sold at auction, and a 5% <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inheritance of estates valued at over 100,000 sesterces by persons other than the next of kin.|$|E

5|$|By 1914, at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Vizzini was the undisputed head of the Mafia in Villalba. The war provided the mafiosi with new opportunities for self-enrichment when the Italian Army requisitioned horses and mules in Sicily for the cavalry and artillery. Vizzini came to {{an agreement with the}} Army Commission to delegate the responsibilities to him. He collected a poll <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> animals whose owners wanted to avoid requisition. He was also the broker for animals that were rustled for the occasion, buying at a low price from the hustlers and selling at market prices to the Army.|$|E

50|$|The Imperial Tax Register of 1241 was {{the first}} {{register}} to include <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Jews. The total of <b>the</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Jews listed in the Register amounted to 857 silver marks; the total contribution of all the cities together amounted to 4.290 silver marks. These local taxes served wholly or in part to finance town-building. Not all of the contributions reached the central administration. In contrast, {{it is clear from}} the Register that the payments made by the Jews reached the Exchequer in their entirety. <b>The</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Jews were first described as the ’’Jewish Tax’’ in 1330.|$|R
5|$|In 1817, Sharp {{was again}} {{elected to the}} Kentucky House of Representatives.

Most notably, he supported the creation of 46 new banks in the state, and proposed a <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> branches of the Bank of the United States in Lexington and Louisville.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the Internal Revenue Service began {{investigating}} the Reagans over allegations they owed additional <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gifts and loans of high-fashion clothes and jewelry to the First Lady during {{their time in}} the White House (recipients benefiting from the display of such items recognize taxable income even if they are returned). In 1992, the IRS determined the Reagans had failed to include some $3 million worth of fashion items between 1983 and 1988 on their tax returns; they were billed for a large amount of back taxes and interest, which was subsequently paid.|$|E

The ballot measure was rejected by 61 percent of voters, with support mostly coming from Bainbridge Island, downtown Bremerton, and Kingston.|$|E
5|$|Tax {{law also}} makes special {{exemptions}} for charitable trusts. They are {{free from the}} income tax paid by individuals and companies, and also the corporation tax paid by incorporated and unincorporated associations. There is no requirement for charitable trusts to pay capital gains tax or council tax, although they are obliged to pay VAT. This freedom from tax liability applies not just to charitable trusts, but also to people who donate to them. Individuals who donate via Gift Aid are free from paying tax on that amount, while companies who give gifts to charity can claim <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> amount back from HM Revenue & Customs.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{played a}} leading {{military}} and political role in the American Revolution. His involvement began in 1767, when he first took political stands against the various acts of the British Parliament. He opposed the 1765 Stamp Act, the first direct <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> colonies imposed by the British Parliament, which included no representatives from the colonies; he began taking {{a leading role in}} the growing colonial resistance when protests became widespread against the Townshend Acts (enacted in 1767). In May 1769, he introduced a proposal, drafted by his friend George Mason and calling for Virginia to boycott English goods until the Acts were repealed.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{took the}} crusader's cross in an {{elaborate}} ceremony on 24June 1268, {{with his brother}} Edmund and cousin Henry of Almain. Among others who committed themselves to the Ninth Crusade were Edward's former adversaries – like the Earl of Gloucester, though de Clare did not ultimately participate. With the country pacified, the greatest impediment to the project was providing sufficient finances. King LouisIX of France, who {{was the leader of}} the crusade, provided a loan of about £17,500. This, however, was not enough; the rest had to be raised through a <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> laity, which had not been levied since 1237. In May 1270, Parliament granted a tax of a twentieth, in exchange for which the King agreed to reconfirm Magna Carta, and to impose restrictions on Jewish money lending. On 20August Edward sailed from Dover for France. Historians have not determined the size of the force with any certainty, but Edward probably brought with him around 225knights and altogether fewer than 1000men.|$|E
5|$|Following a fall in game {{attendance}} in 2009 and 2010, Start decided {{ahead of the}} 2011 season to reduce the stadium's capacity. Advertisement banners were sold to cover the corners, thus reducing the capacity to 11,700 tickets. The club stated that the intention was to move spectators closer together to increase the atmosphere, {{and at the same}} time making it easier to sell out the stadium. In February 2012, Kristiansand District Court sentenced Start to pay NOK6.4 million in value added <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> naming rights. The club stated that they believed the naming rights were exempt. After the 2011 season, Start was again relegated to the First Division. In an attempt to better the club's financial situation, Start agreed to lay artificial turf on Sparebanken Sør Arena, in exchange for NOK250,000 in municipal funding to use the stadium for recreational sports. Removal of the natural pitch started on 28 May 2012.|$|E
5|$|Narvesen had an {{exclusive}} agreement with NSB to operate newsagent's shops at all railway stations, except in stations with restaurants, which were operated by Spisevognselskapet. Narvesen had a near-monopoly on newsagents in Norway, and rented facilities in many public places. The owners of Narvesen intended {{to create a}} foundation to obtain the company; when plans for this started in 1972, they had difficulties {{finding a way to}} transfer shares to the foundation without having to pay <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> transaction. However, the tax laws permitted a tax-free transaction if {{it was part of a}} restructuring. A merger with Spisevognselskapet would be considered a restructuring, and in 1974 Fritt Ord was established to take over Narvesen's owners' share of the company. The agreement between Narvesen and NSB was made in July 1974; in December it was passed by Parliament, although the Conservative Party and Progress Party voted against the merger. A.S Narvesen–Spisevognselskapet was established on 1 January 1975. Fritt Ord owned 50% of the new company and NSB 41%. It assumed the Narvesen name in 1979.|$|E

5|$|Pulsford was {{a leading}} proponent of the free-trade cause, {{although}} an intended candidacy for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1891 did not eventuate. He had contested a by-election for East Sydney earlier that year, losing to protectionist candidate Walter Bradley. He was nevertheless nominated to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1895 by the Free Trade Premier, George Reid. He continued his support of free trade policies, but differentiated himself from his colleagues by firmly opposing restrictions on Asian immigration. He had expressed regret concerning {{the fate of the}} Australian Aborigines in a Telegraph article in 1888 and also opposed Sir Henry Parkes's poll <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Chinese, and now opposed the continuing restrictive measures passed in 1896 and 1898. He {{served as president of the}} Australian Free Trade and Liberal Association's New South Wales branch in 1900 and was deputy president of the federal election campaign committee, standing himself for the Senate in New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|The {{siege of}} Bedford Castle {{required}} huge resources. Siege engines were brought from Lincoln, Northampton and Oxfordshire, while carpenters built others on site using timber from Northamptonshire; ropes from London, Cambridge and Southampton; hides from Northampton and tallow from London. Labourers from across Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire were {{gathered by the}} relevant sheriffs, and miners from Hereford and the Forest of Dean. Crossbow bolts were ordered from a depot at Corfe Castle and from the provinces; 43,300 crossbow bolts {{are known to have}} been ordered by the king. Local trees were cut down, and stone quarrying begun to provide ammunition for siege engines. Tents and pavilions for the King were sent from London along with supplies of luxury foods and wine, also for the King. In total, Henry's wage bill for the siege came to £1,311; it is uncertain exactly how large Henry's army was, but potentially there were between 1,600 and 2,700 men present at any one time. To support the siege, Langton instructed his bishops to mobilise one man from every 24 hectares (60 acres) of land they owned and levied a special <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> churches' estates.|$|E
5|$|The stay of Cardinal Ottobono Fieschi (later Pope Adrian V) in England from 29 October 1265, until July 1268, {{led to a}} {{great deal}} of {{diplomatic}} activity in the Scottish church, in which Albin was perhaps involved. Cardinal Ottobono imposed a general <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> English church, which he extended to Scotland. King Alexander III forbade the payment of this money, and appealed to the papacy; but in 1267 the Scottish clergy persuaded Alexander to abandon his appeal, while they made their own reduced payments. Meanwhile, Cardinal Ottobono's legatine council, to which the Scottish church had sent four delegates, promulgated canons for the English church which he expected the Scottish church to incorporate; the Scottish church {{does not appear to have}} done so, however.|$|E
