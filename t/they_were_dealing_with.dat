5|$|The British, Americans and Soviet Union {{discussed}} the proposal. British Foreign Secretary (later Prime Minister) Anthony Eden wrote a memo on 26 June outlining the options. The British were convinced <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> a Himmler trick, perhaps {{an attempt to}} broker a peace deal without the Soviet Union. If the deal had gone ahead and large numbers of Jews had been released in central Europe, Allied airborne and possibly land-based military operations might have had to stop. Bauer believes the British feared this was Himmler's motive– to turn the Jews into human shields– {{because it would have}} allowed the Germans to devote their forces to fighting the Red Army.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{earliest}} of the Lourdes apparitions, {{there has been}} intense debate regarding their veracity. The earliest investigators, including the priest Abbé Dominique Peyramale and the Chief of Police, Dominique Jacomet, were both initially convinced <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> a hoax (both later changed their minds), and several researchers have since called several aspects of the Lourdes phenomenon into question.|$|E
25|$|Bucharest {{was shaken}} {{by a series}} of crimes {{committed}} {{in the latter half of}} 1970 and the first months of 1971. An unknown individual would use a hammer, a small ax, an iron bar or a knife to attack restaurant waitresses who were alone and returning from work. He struck after midnight during unusual weather conditions such as snowstorms, driving rain, high winds, freezing cold or fog. Many women would not go outside after 9:00 pm except in large groups or with men. Their terror was heightened by the police's reluctance to release details, leading to wildly exaggerated rumors. After a few crimes, the police realized that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> a serial killer; a yearlong investigation, with the help of victims who had survived, led to Rîmaru's arrest on May 27, 1971.|$|E

25|$|ROC and American {{authorities}} {{reached an}} agreement in 1958 to create the 35th Squadron, nicknamed the Black Cat Squadron, composed of two U-2Cs in Taoyuan Air Base in northern Taiwan, at an isolated part of the air base. To create misdirection typical of the time, the unit was created {{under the cover of}} high altitude weather research missions for ROCAF. To the U.S. government, the 35th Squadron and any U.S. CIA/USAF personnel assigned to the unit were known as Detachment H on all documents. But instead of being under normal USAF control, the project was known as Project Razor, and was run directly by the CIA with USAF assistance. Each of the 35th Squadron's operational missions had to be approved by both the U.S. and the ROC presidents beforehand. A further layer of security and secrecy was enforced by all U.S. military and CIA/government personnel stationed in Taoyuan assigned to Detachment H having been issued official documents and IDs with false names and cover titles as Lockheed employees/representatives in civilian clothes. The ROCAF personnel would never know their U.S. counterparts' real names and rank/titles, or which U.S. government agencies <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with.</b>|$|E

So you are kind of trying to teach us something else." [...] Many European fans saw the split as an attempt to increase profits by forcing audiences to pay twice for what was shown as a single film in the United States.|$|E

[...] Charged with contempt in 1956 for having violated the injunction, Reich was sentenced to two years' imprisonment, and that summer over six tons of his publications were burned by order of the court. He died in prison of heart failure {{just over a year}} later, days before he was due to apply for parole.|$|E

500|$|The oil spill, located {{immediately}} {{north of}} Refugio State Beach in Santa Barbara County, California, originated in a [...] diameter underground pipeline named Line 901 owned by Plains All American Pipeline. Crude oil produced by offshore platforms was transported from onshore receiving plants to another pipeline that transported the oil inland for processing. The oil pipeline operators in Midland, Texas had turned off an alarm {{that would have}} notified them of the leak as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> a separate problem with a pump. The 28 year old pipeline was not equipped with an automatic shut-off valve and was eventually shut down by control operators when they were notified of the leak from parties who visually located the spill.|$|E
500|$|In July 1947 Dr. J. J. Durrett, {{director}} of the Medical Advisory Division of the Federal Trade Commission, wrote to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asking them to investigate Reich's claims about {{the health benefits of}} orgone. The FDA assigned an investigator to the case, who learned that Reich had built 250 accumulators. The FDA concluded that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> a [...] "fraud of the first magnitude." [...] According to Sharaf, the FDA suspected a sexual racket of some kind; questions were asked about the women associated with orgonomy and [...] "what was done with them."

500|$|The attackers used a {{satellite}} phone {{and cell phones}} {{to talk to each}} other as well as their handlers that were based in Pakistan. [...] In transcripts intercepted by Indian authorities between the attackers and their handlers, the handlers provided the attackers with encouragement, tactical advice, and information gained from media coverage. The attackers used both personal cell phones and those obtained from their victims to communicate with each other and the news media. Although the attackers were encouraged to murder hostages, the attackers were in communication with the news media via cell phones to make demands in return for the release of hostages. This was believed to be done in order to further confuse Indian authorities that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> primarily a hostage situation.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year Palmer switched the magazine's focus to flying saucers. [...] To {{try to maintain}} the existing readership while attracting new readers, Palmer emphasized sf and flying saucers in alternate issues: for example, the June 1957 issue was titled FLYING SAUCERS from Other Worlds, and the July issue was Flying Saucers from OTHER WORLDS. [...] He also hoped that each issue would be kept longer on newsstands if the distributors thought <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> two magazines. [...] The experiment did not last; from the July/August 1958 issue the title was shortened to Flying Saucers, and the magazine ceased to carry fiction. [...] Palmer retired to Amherst, Wisconsin, and took over its printing. [...] Bibliographic sources focus on the science fiction issues, and do not index the magazine after 1958, but it continued publication until 1976 as a non-fiction magazine.|$|E
