25|$|Film {{historian}} Stephen Bowles {{notes that}} Lumet was most comfortable and {{effective as a}} director of serious psychodramas, as opposed to light entertainments. His Academy Award nominations, for example, were all for character studies of men in crisis, from his first film, Twelve Angry Men, to The Verdict. Lumet excelled at putting drama on the screen. Most of his characters are driven by obsessions or passions, such as the pursuit of justice, honesty, and truth, or jealousy, memory, or guilt. Lumet was intrigued by <b>those</b> <b>kinds</b> of obsessive conditions, writes Bowles.|$|E

25|$|Ceramic {{is on the}} {{one hand}} a very solid material; on the other hand, it breaks even at {{relatively}} low mechanical stress. MLCC chips as surface-mounted components are susceptible to flexing stresses since they are mounted directly on the substrate. They are stuck between soldered joints on the printed circuit board (PCB), and are often exposed to mechanical stresses, for example, if vibration or a bump impacts the circuit board. They are also more sensitive to thermal stresses than leaded components. Excess solder fillet height can multiply these stresses and cause chip cracking. Of all influencing factors, causing a mechanical shock stress to the PCB proved to be the most critical one. The reason is that forces induced by <b>those</b> <b>kinds</b> of stresses are more or less transmitted undampened to the components via the PCB and solder joints.|$|E

[...] During her career, Gaven has sung in both mezzo-soprano and soprano roles, and has been cited for her belting. According to Alvin Klein, theatre critic for The New York Times, she [...] "is categorically a mezzo soprano."

Alaphilippe said that he had briefly thought that he was going to win the sprint; his second-place finish was, however, the most important result of his career so far. He said, [...] "For my first time performance here, I can't help but be pleased." [...] Albasini's third place was better than his team had expected: before the race, 's directeur sportif Matt White had not expected him to be as strong because of the addition of the extra climb.

500|$|Later, in his autobiography, Matlock would {{describe}} the primary impetus for his departure as his increasingly acrimonious relationship with Rotten, {{which he described}} as being exacerbated by the rampant inflation of Rotten's ego [...] "once he'd had {{his name in the}} papers" [...] and instigated by McLaren. Lydon would later claim that [...] "God Save the Queen," [...] the belligerently sardonic song planned as the band's second single, had been the final straw: [...] " [...] couldn't handle <b>those</b> <b>kinds</b> of lyrics.

500|$|Impressed by {{her work}} in Dick, the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman cast Williams in his directorial debut Synecdoche, New York, {{alongside}} Philip Seymour Hoffman and Emily Watson. A box office bomb, it was praised in the media, appearing on many top ten critics' lists for 2008. Wendy and Lucy, an acclaimed small-budget, low-key drama directed and co-written by Kelly Reichardt, follows Wendy, a drifter looking {{to start a new}} life, searching for her dog Lucy after a series of setbacks. Unlike others, including the director, Williams did not find the film depressing. [...] "Personally I like seeing <b>those</b> <b>kinds</b> of movies.

Houston Chronicle writer Amy Biancolli said her performance, [...] "a bare-bones accomplishment of no small heft," [...] was the [...] movie's key.

500|$|In February 2009, Samuel L.

However, in an April 2010 interview, Jackson stated that he would not be appearing in Thor. When asked why not Jackson explained, [...] "I have no idea.

[...] Sims regretted not seeing the fight, and although he claimed to understand the budget constrictions, he felt that [...] "all this off-screen fighting is just getting my blood rushing for some on-screen fighting." [...] Sepinwall concludes: [...] "Ideally, we'd get a few epic, Braveheart-level battle scenes at some point, but I also respect the demands of time and budget here. <b>Those</b> <b>kinds</b> of sequences cost a fortune, and they eat up a lot of screen time, and I think ultimately I'd have rather had the time, say, that we spent in Tyrion's tent the night before the battle, with the mortifying story of his ex-wife, and then whatever it cost to make the execution sequence look as good as it did, than for the episode to have given us one or two long fight scenes." ...|$|E

Certainly, I don't want it back under <b>those</b> <b>kinds</b> of terms." [...] DC Comics co-publishers Dan DiDio and Jim Lee responded: [...] "DC Comics would only revisit these iconic {{characters}} if the creative vision of any proposed new stories matched the quality set by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons nearly 25 years ago, and our first discussion on any of this would naturally be with the creators themselves." [...] Following months of rumors about a potential Watchmen follow-up project, in February 2012 DC announced it was publishing seven prequel series under the [...] "Before Watchmen" [...] banner. Among the creators involved are writers J. Michael Straczynski, Brian Azzarello, Darwyn Cooke, and Len Wein, and artists Lee Bermejo, J. G.

500|$|In January 2016, Joss Whedon {{noted that}} this process [...] "unfortunately just means the TV show gets, you know, leftovers." [...] He stated that, for example, the series' {{creative}} team initially wanted to use Loki's scepter from The Avengers but were unable due to Whedon's plans for it in Age of Ultron. On how their ability {{to connect with the}} films changed {{over the life of the}} series, Jed Whedon said, [...] "The rule when we started was we couldn't say anything about spies, we couldn't say anything about Hydra, we couldn't have any A.I. or robots or anything like that, because all of that was coming in movies that year or the year after. Since then, they've blown those doors wide open." [...] He added, [...] "We have relatively free rein we just can't go anywhere that [...] going. They know their stories so much further out than we do, which is good for us to tee up things that we know are coming to them or avoid things that they want to be special on the big screen. As long as we are not covering bases that they're going to cover, we haven't been told [...] "no" [...] that much". As an example, Whedon noted the fourth season's Framework storyline as [...] "something that's pretty significant in our world, but is also a little eddy in the river that doesn't affect anything else because it's an alternate universe. So <b>those</b> <b>kinds</b> of stories help us go big without sending ripples through the whole MCU." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{his arrival}} in the United States, Woo went through several scripts before {{deciding}} on Hard Target.

I'd done a lot of them already." [...] One of the scripts offered to Woo at this period was for Face/Off, which he turned down at the time, turned off by the science fiction aspect of the story. The script for Hard Target was written by Chuck Pfarrer. Director Andrew Davis was interested in the script, but ultimately turned it down. Woo read Pfarrer's script for Hard Target appreciating that it was a [...] "simple but powerful story, with a lot of feeling underneath. For a good action film you need a solid structure. Chuck gave me that". Woo also stated that the story is [...] "less John Woo" [...] but the visual aspect would be [...] "very John Woo". Pfarrer wrote the script originally basing it on the film The Naked Prey. After the script did not turn out Pfarrer worked on a script influenced by the film Aliens that became the basis for his comic Virus. The final attempt was a script based on the 1932 film The Most Dangerous Game. Pfarrer had the story take place in New Orleans to give an explanation of Jean-Claude Van Damme's accent.|$|E
500|$|Similarly to {{the editing}} process of their {{previous}} DVD Disasterpieces, Crahan watched and analysed all of the footage recorded for the DVD. However in contrast to Disasterpeices this DVD was intended to show a previously unseen side to the band. During an interview in 2006 guitarist Mick Thomson explained that with the DVD the band intended to [...] "bring something new", he also went on to add [...] " [...] more backstage stuff, getting to see more inside stuff {{as opposed to just}} a concert performance." [...] Crahan explained how he wanted to allow the viewer in on more of their time instead of just their performance, recalling a moment when the band were in Australia. He included the footage in the film, explaining; [...] "So I go down to Australia and I go ‘Jesus, there’s bats in the air.’ I’m going to film it and share it with you because it’s part of our lives together. But most bands and people don’t want to share that side of it and I think that’s wrong." [...] Throughout the movie whenever the band members appear unmasked, their faces are blurred, whereas on the second disc, during the interviews, they are completely revealed. When questioned on the subject during an interview on The Sauce in 2007, Crahan explained that when the band perform, the masks are always a part of their show and footage of them unmasked is blurred to represent this. Further adding; [...] "We chose to blur it because, it's really an intrusion. [...] That's our safe place and I kind of broke the veil a little bit by grabbing a camera and trying to show everybody <b>those</b> <b>kinds</b> of things that go on." ...|$|E
