5|$|In 1659, {{shortly before}} the {{restoration}} of the monarchy, the Protector's Council was abolished. Charles II restored the Royal Privy Council, but he, like previous Stuart monarchs, chose to rely on a small group of advisers. Under George I even more power transferred to this committee. It now began <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of the sovereign, communicating its decisions to him after the fact.|$|E
5|$|Considering the ICBM problem, {{the study}} {{went on to}} suggest that the system would have to be {{effective}} between 95 and 100% of the time in order to be worthwhile. They considered attacks against the RV while the missile was in the midcourse, just as it reached the highest point in its trajectory and was traveling at its slowest speed. Practical limitations eliminated this possibility, as it required the ABM to be launched {{at about the same time}} as the ICBM in order <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle, and they could not imagine a way to arrange this. Working at much shorter ranges, during the terminal phase, seemed the only possible solution.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{one can see}} Gaelic {{written on}} the walls of the parish church, but the {{language}} has effectively died out, and English is totally dominant. Nevertheless, there are still some 72 residents (4.3%) of the village who know the language. The village is also a big location on the Highland folk-circuit, and enjoys a vibrant musical culture in the Gaelic tradition. It is a regular practice for local musicians <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Balconie Inn, one of the two licensed establishments of the town, and engage in evening-long sessions. Many prominent musicians on the Celtic music scene have visited, including Eilidh Steel and Dougie MacLean.|$|E

5|$|Visitation, {{for those}} {{able to make}} the journey, was {{strictly}} controlled by school officials {{in a manner similar to}} the procedures enforced in the prison system. In some cases visitors were altogether denied access to their children, while in others families were required <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of school officials and forced to communicate in English. For parents unable to speak the language, verbal communication with their children was impossible. The obstacles families faced to visit their children were further exacerbated by the pass system. Introduced by Reed without legislative authority to do so, the system restricted and closely monitored the movement of Indigenous peoples off reserves. Launched in 1885 as a response to the North-West Rebellion, and later replaced by permits, the system was designed to prevent Indigenous people from leaving reserves without a pass issued by a local Indian agent.|$|E
5|$|Between 2011–12, {{they met}} in four {{consecutive}} Grand Slam tournament finals, just {{the second time in}} tennis history this has happened. In doing so, they also became the second pair in history, after Venus and Serena Williams, <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> finals of each of the four different Grand Slam events. Djokovic defeated Nadal in the first three (from Wimbledon to the Australian Open), making Nadal the first player in history to lose three consecutive Grand Slam event finals. However, Nadal defeated Djokovic in the French Open final, denying him a Career Grand Slam and the opportunity to become the first man since Rod Laver to hold all four Majors at once. The two also share the record for the longest Australian Open and Grand Slam tournament final match ever played (5 hours and 53 minutes), at the 2012 Australian Open final. This and the 2013 French Open semifinal they contested, are considered two of the greatest matches of all time. At ATP Masters 1000 level, they have met 26 times, 12 of which were in the final (a record), including the 2013 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters, where Djokovic ended Nadal's 47-match winning run and eight-year winning streak at the event.|$|E
5|$|Many of the weekend's Premier League {{fixtures}} were {{rescheduled to}} avoid a clash with the final, with some kicking off at 12:45 on Saturday and others on Sunday. By coincidence, Manchester City and Stoke City were scheduled <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league on cup final day. The league match was rearranged for the Wednesday after the final. This prompted criticism from Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp, whose team was challenging Manchester City for {{a place in the}} 2011–12 Champions League. Redknapp stated that if Manchester City won the final, it would then be in Stoke City's interest to lose against Manchester City in the league match, as it would make Europa League qualification for Stoke more likely. Stoke City refuted this accusation strongly, but ultimately this scenario was avoided. Champions League qualification was settled four days before the final, when Manchester City beat Tottenham Hotspur 1–0 in a league match.|$|E

5|$|Mega Man and Bass begin a final {{confrontation}} with Dr. Wily in his newly regained laboratory. When Wily is beaten, Bass demands {{to know why}} he deceived him. Wily explains that he created King simply to test Bass' abilities. Wily shows him written plans for making a newer version of King to join with Bass in this venture, promising that the two would be invincible together. Proto Man appears and immediately destroys these plans. Wily then demands Bass to destroy Proto Man, but Bass is unsure. It was then Proto Man tells Bass that although he is a strong robot of free will, he can never defeat his rival because he has nothing for which to fight. Bass doesn't care and forces Proto Man to leave, saying that he will still destroy Mega Man to prove his cause. Mega Man returns home where his sister Roll presents him a letter from King, who has somehow escaped the destruction of his castle. King wishes to atone for his own crimes against humans and hopes {{for them to be}} friends if they were <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future.|$|E
5|$|With {{the growth}} of bowl games, it became {{difficult}} to determine a national champion in a fair and equitable manner. As conferences became contractually bound to certain bowl games (a situation known as a tie-in), match-ups that guaranteed a consensus national champion became increasingly rare. In 1992, seven conferences and independent Notre Dame formed the Bowl Coalition, which attempted to arrange an annual No.1 versus No.2 matchup based on the final AP poll standings. The Coalition lasted for three years; however, several scheduling issues prevented much success; tie-ins still took precedence in several cases. For example, the Big Eight and SEC champions could never meet, since they were contractually bound to different bowl games. The coalition also excluded the Rose Bowl, arguably the most prestigious game in the nation, and two major conferences—the Pac-10 and Big Ten—meaning that it had limited success. In 1995, the Coalition {{was replaced by the}} Bowl Alliance, which reduced the number of bowl games to host a national championship game to three—the Fiesta, Sugar, and Orange Bowls—and the participating conferences to five—the ACC, SEC, Southwest, Big Eight, and Big East. It was agreed that the No.1 and No.2 ranked teams gave up their prior bowl tie-ins and were guaranteed <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> national championship game, which rotated between the three participating bowls. The system still did not include the Big Ten, Pac-10, or the Rose Bowl, and thus still lacked the legitimacy of a true national championship.|$|E
5|$|Bianca tells Whitney she {{is moving}} to Milton Keynes with her partner Terry Spraggan (Terry Alderton), and wants her to move with them and the children. Although {{originally}} agreeing, Lee persuades her to stay and she moves into the pub with the Carters. Lee develops depression, and when Whitney finds out, she struggles to support him at his lowest points. At Mick's stag party before his wedding to Linda, Lee knocks himself unconscious and is carried upstairs by Mick and Whitney. Whitney confesses to Mick that she intends to break up with Lee after the wedding, unable to handle his depression. However, she is unaware that Lee has overheard her via the baby monitor. On {{the day of the}} wedding, Lee goes missing and Whitney and Mick find him drunk at the park. Lee tells Whitney that he blames himself for her wanting to break up with him, and she promises him that they will work things out. Whitney later thanks Mick for helping her with Lee, but accidentally kisses him on the lips in the process. While Mick and Linda are on their honeymoon, Whitney invites Ryan back to Walford to see Lily, but while at the pub, he steals the cash from the safe, causing Whitney and Nancy to fight, just as Mick and Linda walk in on them. The next morning, Whitney contacts Ryan and he asks <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park. Mick accompanies Whitney and assures a scared Ryan that he can trust him. It then emerges that Whitney told Mick that Ryan killed Rob, so Whitney and Mick convince Ryan to return the money and hand himself to the police, and Whitney will back him up in the hope of him being charged with manslaughter instead of murder, to which Ryan agrees. Whitney shares an emotional goodbye with Ryan as he heads into the police station. On the ride home from the police station, an upset Whitney tells Mick that she has feelings for him and kisses him again. Mick tells Linda what happened, so Linda tells her to stay away from Mick and not to give up on Lee. Whitney later visits Ryan in prison, stating that she is worried about Lee. When she accidentally says Mick's name, he guesses that she has feelings for Mick, which she denies. He then urges Whitney to help Lee, so she gets him a job interview at a local pub, however this causes major grievances between Lee and Nancy. Whitney is forced by Babe to tell Lee about her kissing Mick, and although Nancy tells her to move out, Lee's response is to propose marriage.|$|E
