25|$|Psychologist Daniel Wegner {{has argued}} that an introspection {{illusion}} contributes to belief in psychokinesis. He observes that in everyday experience, intention (such as wanting to turn on a light) is followed by action (such as flicking a light switch) in a reliable way, but the underlying neural mechanisms are outside awareness. Hence, though subjects may feel that they directly introspect their own free will, the experience of control is actually inferred from relations between the thought and the action. This theory of apparent mental causation acknowledges the influence of David Hume's view of the mind. This process for detecting when one is responsible for an action is not totally reliable, and when it goes wrong there can be an illusion of control. This can happen when an external event follows, and is congruent with, a thought in someone's mind, without an actual causal link. As evidence, Wegner cites a series of experiments on magical thinking in which subjects were induced to <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> influenced external events. In one experiment, subjects watched a basketball player taking a series of free throws. When they were instructed to visualize him making his shots, they {{felt that they had}} contributed to his success. Other experiments designed to create an illusion of psychokinesis have demonstrated that this depends, to some extent, on the subject's prior belief in psychokinesis.|$|E
500|$|Other {{accomplished}} {{early works}} include the two string quartets, composed between 1928 and 1930, in which Tippett sought {{to combine the}} styles of Beethoven and Haydn respectively with folk-song, as Beethoven had in his Rasumovsky quartets of 1806. Tippett explains the withdrawal of these and the other early works: [...] "I realised very clearly {{that they were not}} totally consonant with myself. I didn't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> the stamp of artistic durability. So I took the whole lot along to R.O. Morris who agreed that they didn't show enough technical mastery." ...|$|E
500|$|Casting for mermaids {{required}} the actresses to have natural breasts—no implants. As Bruckheimer explained to EW, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> breast augmentation in the 1700s, [...] So it's natural for casting people to say, 'We want real people.'" [...] Marshall invited Spanish-French actress Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey to play Syrena after seeing {{her in a}} French magazine article on up-and-coming actresses. Bergès-Frisbey had to take lessons of English, swimming and breath control for the role. The rest of the mermaid portrayers, such as Australian supermodel Gemma Ward, were chosen for having [...] "exotic sense, an otherworldly sensibility, but also under those layers a deadly quality", according to Marshall, and had to take swimming lessons to learn movements such as the dolphin and eggbeater kicks.|$|E

500|$|In 2015, Shearsmith {{said that}} he and Pemberton had no {{intention}} to write any further silent episodes, as they would not want viewers to <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> run out of ideas, while Pemberton separately said that the pair had no desire to do what would be an inferior version of [...] "A Quiet Night In". [...] "Cold Comfort", the fourth episode of the second series of Inside No. 9, was compared to [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] by Pemberton, Shearsmith and some critics. [...] "Cold Comfort" [...] was also filmed an experimental style, with most of the episode shot from fixed cameras and displayed on a split screen. Despite this—with its focus on listening {{and the fact that it}} was mostly static—"Cold Comfort" [...] could, for Pemberton, be seen as the [...] "polar opposite" [...] of [...] "A Quiet Night In".|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} [...] "guinea" [...] in [...] "guinea pig" [...] {{is harder to}} explain. One {{proposed}} {{explanation is that the}} animals were brought to Europe by way of Guinea, leading people to <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> originated there. [...] "Guinea" [...] was also frequently used in English to refer generally to any far-off, unknown country, so the name may simply be a colorful reference to the animal's exotic appeal. Another hypothesis suggests the [...] "guinea" [...] in the name is a corruption of [...] "Guiana", an area in South America. A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold {{for the price of a}} guinea coin; this hypothesis is untenable, because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663, and William Harvey used the term [...] "Ginny-pig" [...] as early as 1653. Others believe [...] "guinea" [...] may be an alteration of the word [...] (rabbit); guinea pigs were referred to as [...] "pig coneys" [...] in Edward Topsell's 1607 treatise on quadrupeds.|$|E
500|$|Secret Service {{and other}} {{authorities}} {{said they were}} treating the plot very seriously, but acknowledged it {{did not appear to}} have moved to an advanced stage. Authorities said there {{did not appear to be}} any formal assassination plan and said they were unable to immediately assess how capable the men were of carrying out the attack. Federal authorities told the Associated Press they did not believe Schlesselman and Cowart had the means to carry out their threat. Barack Obama did not have any campaign appearances planned for Tennessee. One federal law enforcement official told the AP that [...] plans did not include Obama's schedule or a specific time and place for the assassination because, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> that level of detail." [...] Authorities said they made several mistakes during their planning, including drawing too much attention to themselves with their car markings. Authorities also felt their inability to carry out a home robbery together indicated they would be unable to carry out a sophisticated assassination plot. When asked whether the alleged threats were real, Daniel Cowart's lawyer, Joe H. Byrd, told reporters, [...] "White top hats and tuxedos? You tell me." ...|$|E

500|$|Tony Blair {{recorded}} his {{part for the}} episode in April 2003, in ten minutes at Downing Street. Blair was sent the script {{early on in the}} writing process, and it took eight months of negotiation between Fox and Blair's director of communications Alastair Campbell before Blair could appear as a guest star. In the original script, Blair was supposed to welcome the Simpsons to the United Kingdom [...] "with a garland of 'genuine Newcastle coal' and hand [...] a complimentary Corgi", but Campbell had them changed, as Blair [...] "made it very clear that he was only interested in doing the show if he could promote tourism in Britain". The show's staff did not know whether Blair would actually record his lines until showrunner Al Jean and his wife were in London promoting the 300th episode of The Simpsons. They received a call stating: [...] "If you go over to Downing Street tomorrow and can promise to get the recording done in 15 minutes, then the Prime Minister will do it". Jean was [...] "so nervous, it was ridiculous" [...] when he met Blair, an event he has cited as [...] "one of the most fantastic moments of his life". Blair was the top choice to guest star in the episode, but the staff did not <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> a chance to get him to appear. Blair is the only head of government to guest star in the show, with Rudy Giuliani (who played himself in the episode [...] "Stop! Or My Dog Will Shoot") the only other politician to guest star.|$|E
2500|$|Rumours later {{suggested}} that the Irish had ensured their opponents would be intoxicated the night before, but speaking in 2003 Goodwin denied that, saying [...] "They were very late getting in {{on the plane and}} they had a long drive from the airport. We might have had a few, but I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> time to have a drink". The Irish drew the subsequent two-day game, thus winning the series.|$|E

2500|$|Founding era Acts of Congress {{imposing}} obligations {{on state}} judges are not evidence of federal power over state officials because, {{according to the}} Court, the Madisonian Compromise had agreed to leave the creation of lower federal courts optional. The Court rejected the Government’s argument that Federalist No. 36, Federalist No. 45, and Federalist No. 27 anticipated that Congress would “make use” of state officials. [...] Rather, the Court viewed “almost two centuries of apparent congressional avoidance of the practice” as strong evidence that Congressmen did not <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> the power to command state officials.|$|E
2500|$|Accepting the Award, Mr Eastwood said: [...] "Any kind of {{association}} with John Ford is most directors' dream, {{as he was}} certainly a pioneer of American filmmaking and I grew up on his films. His Westerns had a great influence on me, as I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> on everybody.

I want to thank everybody who is here from the Irish Academy, the John Ford family and thank you to John Ford Ireland." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the April 2014 Bundy standoff, {{in which}} the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) {{attempted}} to round up cattle belonging to rancher Cliven Bundy, who refused to vacate public land, Jerad Miller {{was said to have}} been among the armed protesters who joined Bundy during the incident. According to Bundy's son, Ammon Bundy, the Millers were present during the standoff for a few days, but had been instructed by a militia member to leave due to [...] "their radical beliefs", which did not align with the protest's main issues. They were also instructed to leave because Jerad Miller was a felon in possession of a firearm. Carol Bundy later commented, [...] "I have not seen or heard anything from the militia and others who have came to our ranch that would, in any way, make me <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> an intent to kill or harm anyone." ...|$|E

2500|$|Krauthammer {{has said}} of his writing {{in support of the}} Reagan Doctrine, [...] "I {{basically}} came to the conclusion ... the Soviets had overextended their empire, and they were getting what the West had gotten with its overextended empire decades before a reaction, they got a rebellion, they got resistance. And the Soviets were now beginning to feel it, and the genius of Reagan, although I don’t <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> a plan in doing this is he instinctively realized that one of the ways to go after the Soviets was indirect, and that is you go after their proxies, you go after their allies, you go after their clients, or even in Afghanistan you go after them directly. So that’s what I called the Reagan Doctrine, it was sort of the opposite of the Brezhnev Doctrine, which was whatever we control we keep. And Reagan was saying, no you don’t." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{factor in}} the Phillies' decline was the {{acquisition}} of Iván DeJesús from the Cubs in return for Bowa and a young prospect named Ryne Sandberg. [...] Although the trade is now reckoned {{as one of the}} most lopsided trades in baseball history, it may have made some sense at the time from the Phillies' perspective. [...] Although Sandberg had clearly earned a spot in the majors (he'd hit [...]290 in the minors for two years in a row), the Phillies didn't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> a position for him. [...] He'd seen time in the minors at shortstop, second base, third base and center field—spots held by Bowa, Manny Trillo, Schmidt and Maddox, respectively. [...] Nonetheless, the Phillies didn't get nearly enough in return. [...] DeJesus only batted [...]249 in three years with the Phillies, and was out of baseball by 1988. [...] Meanwhile, Sandberg went on to a Hall of Fame career.|$|E

[...] Carol Bundy said, [...] "I have not seen or heard anything from the militia {{and others who have}} came to our ranch that would, in any way, make me <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> an intent to kill or harm anyone." [...] Bundy's son said that the couple had been asked to leave the ranch after a few days because they were [...] "very radical" [...] and did not align themselves with the protest's main issues. According to Mark Potok, a spokesperson for the Southern Poverty Law Center, Jerad and Amanda Miller considered the outcome of the standoff as [...] "a huge victory against the federal government", which reportedly motivated them to commit the shooting spree.|$|E

2500|$|Johnson {{became a}} Christian {{following}} a divorce, {{and later became}} an elder in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). Johnson recounts that on sabbatical in England he sought, through prayer, inspiration for {{what he should do}} with the rest of his life, and then received an epiphany after he read Richard Dawkins' The Blind Watchmaker (1986) and Michael Denton's [...] (1985). Johnson later said, [...] "Something about the Darwinists' rhetorical style made me <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> something to hide." [...] Despite having no formal background in biology, he felt that could add insight into the premises and arguments. [...] Johnson stated that he approaches the creation evolution dispute not as a scientist but as an academic lawyer by profession, with a specialty in analyzing the logic of arguments and identifying the assumptions that lie behind those arguments. He noted that what people think about evolutionism depends very heavily on the kind of logic they employ and the kind of assumptions they make. Further, he pointed out that four of the eleven members of the special committee appointed by the National Academy of Sciences to prepare its official booklet titled Science and Creationism were lawyers. Since the publication of the first edition of Darwin on Trial in 1991, he has become a prominent critic of evolutionary theory.|$|E
