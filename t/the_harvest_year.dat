40|$|Bamboo is an {{important}} resource for humans, particularly in Asia, providing shoots for food and calms for construction. It is also an ideal subject for intensive management. However, most of the resource is obtained from wild stands for which the sustainability of harvests is poorly documented and intensive management is often impractical or inappropriate. I conducted two shoot harvest trials in riparian stands of the north Australian bamboo Bambusa arnhemica F. Muell. (Poaceae), testing a harvest protocol in which stands are rotated among years. In both trials, harvest {{had no effect on}} recruit numbers, but recruits were markedly smaller than in control clumps. There was no residual effect of the harvest on recruit size or number in subsequent years. However, both trials demonstrated that the harvest clumps failed to increase recruitment in subsequent years to compensate for the loss of biomass in <b>the</b> <b>harvest</b> <b>year.</b> This rotational harvest system cannot be recommended because a cumulative loss of biomass is predicted with multiple harvest cycles.

The relative K+ content and distribution in the skin cells was determined by energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis, revealing a non-uniform accumulation of K+ in grape skin cells. Storage at 0 °C in air causes a significant decrease in bound water levels and greater soluble-water K+ accumulation, irrespective of <b>the</b> <b>harvest</b> <b>year.</b> Furthermore, low temperature-scanning electron microscopy images revealed that the epidermal and the first hypodermal layers of the cells were compressed in the skin of fruit stored in air.

Observations on the anamorphic structures (conidiophores and conidia) allowed separation of isolates into three groups. Pseudothecia, asci and ascospores from sexual crosses between isolates from a same anamorphic group but originated from different regions showed the typical characteristics of three recognized species (anamorph/ teleomorph) : Bipolaris cynodontis (Cochliobolus cynodontis); B. curvispora (C. melinidis) and B. oryzae (C. miyabeanus). All species were widely distributed across the rice-growing regions. Overall, the most prevalent species were B. oryzae (44. 6 %) and B. curvispora (42, 9 %) followed by B. cynodontis (24, 1 %).
