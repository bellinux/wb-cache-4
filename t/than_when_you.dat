6000|$|... "Tired and miserable, poor heart. Years {{and years}} older <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> saw her last. Quite a staid, worn woman now. 'Tis the man--she can't stomach un, even now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tell your {{grandfather}} I trust {{you all to}} him. He must forgive. Say so to him. You'll be a better son to him <b>than</b> I. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> know all, don't remember it against me.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Fielding H. Yost, who was {{not known}} to praise his players publicly, said of Craig: [...] "Is Jimmy Craig 'game?' You’ll have to invent a new word, more {{emphatic}} <b>than</b> that, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> describe him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, {{there is}} another fraud. I was told it would help your appetite, {{and here you are}} with less <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> left Hot Springs. If I'd had my way----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Walkirk," [...] said I, [...] "as my under-study {{go ahead}} and finish this book. You never came nearer the truth <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> said that that {{material}} is vastly interesting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No idea," [...] she answered. [...] "One {{would imagine}} that it was someone of importance. Are you any wiser <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> came dear master?" [...] she added under her breath.|$|E
6000|$|... "Busy!" [...] said Elinor. [...] "There must be {{something}} even more unusual <b>than</b> that, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are too low spirited to keep up a quarrel with me. Why dont you sit on the easy chair, or sprawl on the ottoman, after your manner?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Because, I am {{thankful to}} say, {{your life is}} no longer in danger. And I have told you that she is gone because, strange as it may seem, I believe you can stand this news better now <b>than</b> later <b>when</b> <b>you</b> get stronger.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Less <b>than</b> ever <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{learn that}} I am very closely {{concerned}} in {{the visit of}} M. de La Tour d'Azyr. I am the object of this visit." [...] And {{she looked at him}} with sparkling eyes and lips parted in laughter.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{expect that}} since he lost your mother's {{influence}} and help he may have sunk lower <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> had seen him before. Did your father give you any directions about him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{like you}} much better {{as you are}} now <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> indulge that bitter vein of yours, Razumov. And nobody in the house saw you return--eh? That might have {{appeared}} queer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No idea," [...] she answered. [...] "One {{would imagine}} that it was some one of importance. Are you any wiser <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> came, dear master?" [...] she added, under her breath.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{may not be}} so all-fired {{smart as}} you think you are, but I ain't quite a fool. Why, I've managed bigger things <b>than</b> this <b>when</b> <b>you</b> was around beggin' for something' to eat, 'cause you was too chicken-hearted {{to do this kind of}} work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would ask}} you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant no more <b>than</b> this <b>when</b> <b>you</b> first spoke to me, why should you not wish your brother to overhear what you said? There is nothing to which he, or anyone else, could object." ...|$|R

6000|$|DON JUAN. Consider, Senora: was {{not this}} true {{even when you}} lived on earth? When you were 70, were you really older {{underneath}} your wrinkles and your grey hams <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were 30? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, well. You {{are not so}} {{advanced}} in life but that if you came into anything good, you might marry and start on a new lease! You are pounds better <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> came here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I DON'T WANT to {{know their}} names, I tell you! What do I care about folk dead and gone? Upon my soul you are more sober when you've been {{drinking}} <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have not!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] we said, [...] "you {{are showing}} {{that we are}} more comfortably housed <b>than</b> the Europeans, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> should be {{treating}} the fact of relative cheapness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{think that}} serious {{conversation}} upon the whole has more allurements <b>than</b> conversation which <b>when</b> <b>you</b> come {{to examine it}} is found to mean nothing. Don't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please don't, mamma! I meant old for darling. You {{are hardly}} twenty-five years older <b>than</b> I am. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> talk {{in that way}} my life shrivels up before me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "St. Paul? Why, don't {{you like}} it? I don't {{know of any}} lovelier view <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> stand on Summit Avenue and look across Lower Town to the Mississippi cliffs and the upland farms beyond." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, what a path {{you have}} worn here, Septimius!" [...] said the girl. [...] "You walk {{miles and miles}} on this one spot, and get no farther on <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> started. That is strange walking!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Alban ran in, and {{received}} the visitor cordially with both hands. [...] "Welcome back to England! I needn't ask if the sea-voyage has done you good. You are looking ten years younger <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> went away." ...|$|E
5000|$|However, Barker {{has also}} stated, [...] "It's {{really hard to}} accept {{anything}} less <b>than</b> perfect <b>when</b> <b>you</b> start to get wrapped up in this process {{of being able to}} constantly make changes. Eventually you have to kind of bring down the hammer at the color stage and live with what you've got." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is perfect! I won't {{say more}} <b>than</b> that. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> are praising {{a person to}} another who is to know her, it is bad policy to go into details. I won't exaggerate. I simply {{recommend}} her. Among all women I have known she stands alone; she is of a different clay." ...|$|R
6000|$|With silent indignation Fanny {{repeated}} to herself, [...] "Never happier!--never happier <b>than</b> <b>when</b> {{doing what}} <b>you</b> must know was not justifiable!--never happier <b>than</b> <b>when</b> behaving so dishonourably and unfeelingly! Oh! what a corrupted mind!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Except {{for your}} mental condition, you're {{in better shape}} now <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> came home." [...] Doctor Bronson peered at Lane from under his shaggy brows, walked to the window, looked out, and returned, evidently deep in thought.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, I always eat well. But I'm thinner <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{were here}} last. I'm {{glad to be}} thinner, I didn't like being so fat. Dr. Wigram thinks I'm all the better for being thinner than I was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{was never}} more {{surprised}} <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> came in yesterday, Bob; regular floored I was. It {{was only a}} few days ago I was thinking over that rig we were in together. We made a good bit out of that.' ...|$|E
60|$|But let us {{step inside}} {{of this great}} edifice. I think you will be there even more {{impressed}} with its height and extent <b>than</b> <b>you</b> were <b>when</b> <b>you</b> stood on the outside.|$|R
6000|$|... "It ain't blowin' any harder <b>than</b> it was <b>when</b> <b>you</b> went below," [...] Jim {{replied in}} surprise, {{understanding}} by {{the tone of}} the voice that it was Bob Brace who had spoken.|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} the {{environment}} has become central, which is where it belongs, in the vicissitudes of human life.
