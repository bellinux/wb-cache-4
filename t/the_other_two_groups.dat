Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the traditional Papilionoidea is paraphyletic with respect to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups,</b> so they should both be included within Papilionoidea, to form a single butterfly group, thereby synonymous with the clade Rhopalocera.|$|E

25|$|The {{journey to}} Grant-Hibbert's {{position}} took Farran {{and his men}} four days; the first 50 miles were uneventful, as local French resistance fighters were able to help the SAS troopers avoid German positions. To increase the chances of not being discovered, Farran split the jeeps into three groups, and ordered them to maintain a distance of 30 minutes and avoid all German resistance; unfortunately the first group disobeyed the orders and drove through the village of Mailly-le-Chateau, occupied by a German garrison. Although the group {{made it through the}} village, losing a jeep in the process, Farran and the next group were ambushed and came under fire, forcing his group and the following one to divert south to the Foret de St Jean, rendezvousing with the first group. The same process took place on the following day, but once again the leading group encountered German troops and suffered heavy losses, only the commander surviving and escaping; they were unable to warn <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups,</b> which were also attacked. Farran and his men were able to skirt the Germans, but the third group were all but destroyed, with only a few surviving.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> of protesters, however, {{maintained}} their positions for weeks to come. The art gallery {{closed for the}} duration of the occupation, probably more because of the spectacle of shabbily dressed homeless men juxtaposed against the opulent exhibits of high art than for any logistical reasons. The RCPU emphasized discipline among its members in order to win rather than alienate public sympathy, which was evident at the other two locations that remained open to the public. Chief Constable Colonel W. W. Foster attempted to persuade the men to leave, telling them that they had made their point and should now go home. Brodie responded that if they had homes, they would be in them, and invited the colonel to arrest them. They offered to submit to arrest peacefully, and continued to do so {{for the duration of}} the occupation. Foster refused, and instead sought to manage the situation rather than clog the local prison with 1000 demonstrators and giving them the publicity they sought. The attorney-general agreed with Colonel Foster that the strikers would likely vacate on their own in a matter of days. But even as the strike dragged on from days into weeks, the police stood by awaiting orders before proceeding with an eviction. Colonel Foster had earned a reputation for diplomacy with the unemployed during the 1935 strike, which he appeared to be cultivating again in 1938. Behind the scenes, however, Foster was plotting with politicians and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to evacuate the post office and art gallery.|$|E
500|$|There was {{a boom in}} {{interest}} in astrology in the late 1960s. The sociologist Marcello Truzzi described three levels of involvement of [...] "Astrology-believers" [...] to account for its revived popularity {{in the face of}} scientific discrediting. He found that most astrology-believers did not claim it was a scientific explanation with predictive power. Instead, those superficially involved, knowing [...] "next to nothing" [...] about astrology's 'mechanics', read newspaper astrology columns, and could benefit from [...] "tension-management of anxieties" [...] and [...] "a cognitive belief-system that transcends science." [...] Those at the second level usually had their horoscopes cast and sought advice and predictions. They were much younger than those at the first level, and could benefit from knowledge of the language of astrology and the resulting ability to belong to a coherent and exclusive group. Those at the third level were highly involved and usually cast horoscopes for themselves. Astrology provided this small minority of astrology-believers with a [...] "meaningful view of their universe and [...] them an understanding of their place in it." [...] This third group took astrology seriously, possibly as a sacred canopy, whereas <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> took it playfully and irreverently.|$|E
