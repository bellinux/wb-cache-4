40|$|Traction {{tests were}} carried out using a {{constant}} speed motor to drag a studded metal sled, acting as a simplified shoe sole, across an artificial surface. The traction force of studded footwear is dependent {{on a number of}} variables including stud geometry, turf type, depth of stud penetration and velocity. In order to investigate the significance of each variable on <b>traction,</b> an <b>effort</b> was made to carry out tests in which as many variables as possible were kept constant. This study evaluates the effect of stud depth, cross-sectional area and velocity for cylindrical studs on XL artificial turf. Previous studies have shown that lift forces can arise during such testing causing the sled to rise out of the surface. Therefore, a traction rig, built in-house, has been modified to maintain a constant penetration level during movement. The static traction, dynamic traction and initial loading rate were compared for each stud type. Dynamic traction shows strong dependence on the cross-sectional area of the stud penetrated in the surface. An increase in sled velocity increases dynamic traction but the effect is less severe than stud area. Static traction and loading rate area are influenced similarly to dynamic traction, but the effects are not as significant due to greater uncertainties in these measurements. Such tests have implications on the design of studs in that the change in traction force for proposed subtle geometry changes to studs can be predicted...|$|R

40|$|O bambu é uma planta renovável, perene, {{tropical}} e que apresenta uma série de vantagens, tais como: crescimento rápido, elevada resistência mecânica, grande versatilidade, beleza, e não necessita do replantio de colmos. Certamente, fica evidente que o bambu é um material de grande potencial, para diversos setores, sobretudo da construção civil, em que o mesmo vem sendo utilizado desde os tempos mais remotos. Nas estruturas de concreto, o bambu tem sido estudado como um elemento passível de resistir aos esforços de tração. Entretanto, como desvantagens, o bambu é um material orgânico e higroscópico. Após a concretagem, durante a cura do concreto, o bambu absorve água e, consequentemente, tem suas dimensões aumentadas. Com o concreto endurecido, o bambu começa a perder a água absorvida e se retrai, sofrendo uma redução de seu volume, o que diminui a eficiência da aderência entre os materiais. Outra desvantagem do bambu é a região do nó, cuja resistência à tração é muito inferior à da região internodal. O presente trabalho tem como principal objetivo avaliar o comportamento estrutural de vigas de concreto armado, sem e com reforço adicional de taliscas de bambu, por meio de ensaios de flexão. As taliscas de bambu utilizadas como reforço adicional à armadura são de dois tipos: com e sem reforços nas regiões nodais. Com o intuito de analisar a condição de aderência entre a talisca de bambu e o concreto, foram realizados ensaios de arrancamento. As taliscas foram elaboradas a partir de colmos da espécie Bambusa vulgaris, disponível na cidade de Ilha Solteira, algumas com e outras sem reforços nas regiões nodais. Todas as taliscas foram impermeabilizadas com látex de seringueira. Para a colagem dos reforços nos nós das taliscas, foi utilizada uma resina poliuretana bicomponente à base de óleo de mamona. As taliscas com reforços colados apresentaram um aumento da resistência à tração. Com relação ao ensaio de arrancamento, a existência do reforço nos nós permitiu acréscimos em relação à tensão normal, provocando a ruptura da talisca e não o seu escorregamento. Quanto ao ensaio de flexão das vigas, concluiu-se que a presença das taliscas de bambu aumentou a capacidade resistente das vigas e, portanto, poderia se pensar na redução da quantidade de aço a ser utilizado. O reforço nos nós das taliscas de bambu proporcionou um melhor comportamento com relação às flechas e um discreto aumento na capacidade resistente das vigas. No que diz respeito ao padrão de fissuração, observou-se que a ruptura das vigas ocorreu na região central, região submetida aos maiores momentos fletores, e, embora as vigas com reforço adicional de taliscas de bambu reforçadas nos nós tenham apresentado maior número de fissuras, aparentemente, o padrão de fissuração foi basicamente o mesmo para todas as vigas ensaiadas. Bamboo is a renewable, perennial {{and tropical}} plant, and that presents {{a number of}} advantages, such as: growth quickly, high mechanical resistance, versatility, beauty, and {{does not require the}} replanting of culms. Certainly it is clear that bamboo is a great potential material for various industries, especially construction, in which it has been used since ancient times. In concrete structures, bamboo has been studied as an element capable of resisting the <b>traction</b> <b>efforts.</b> However, as disadvantages, bamboo is an organic and hygroscopic material. After the concrete, during curing of the concrete, bamboo absorbs water and, therefore, has increased their dimensions. With the hardened concrete, bamboo begins to lose water absorbed and retracts suffering a reduction of its volume, which decreases the efficiency of adhesion between the materials. Another disadvantage of bamboo is the node region, whose tensile strength is much lower than the internode region. This study has as main objective to evaluate the structural behavior of reinforced concrete beams, with and without additional reinforcement bamboo splints through bending tests. The bamboo splints used as additional reinforcement to armor are of two types: with and without reinforcements in the node regions. In order to examine the condition of adhesion between the concrete and bamboo splint pull out tests were done. The splints were prepared from culms of Bambusa vulgaris species, available in the city of Ilha Solteira, some with and some without reinforcements in the node regions. All splints were coated with rubber trees latex. For bonding reinforcements in nodes of splints, we used a two-component polyurethane resin oil-based of castor plant. Samples with glued reinforcements showed an increase in the tensile strength. Regarding the pull out test, the existence of reinforcement in the nodes allowed increases in relation to normal tension, causing the rupture of splint and not its slipping. As for the bending test of the beams, it is concluded that the presence of bamboo splints increased bearing capacity of the beams and, therefore, could think of reducing the amount of steel to be used. Strengthening the nodes of bamboo splints provide better performance with respect to deflections and a slight increase in resitente capacity of beams. With regard to the crack pattern, it was observed that the breakage of the beams occurred in the central region, region subjected to higher bending moments, and, although the beams with additional reinforcement bamboo splints reinforced in the nodes had a higher number of cracks, apparently, the crack pattern was essentially the same for all tested beams...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the dynamics of}} the tractor-implement combination in traction works, in the specific soil conditions present in Southern Portuguese agriculture. The tillage operations are very power demanding and are therefore responsible for significant energy inputs. The inappropriate operation of the tractor, in regarding to engine and gearbox speeds and poor management of ballast and tire inflation pressure, combined with poor regulation of tillage implements can result in significant energetic efficiency losses with impact on the economic returns that can be provided by agriculture to farmers and the viability of agricultural enterprises. The purpose of this project was to study tractor-implement dynamics in tillage operations. A portable computer- based recording system (data acquisition system) was developed and installed on tractors to monitor engine speed, fuel consumption, actual forward speed, wheel slip and draught force required for trailed implements. The field tests were performed under real working conditions. Field trials carried out under different working conditions allowed, firstly, to establish predictive models for <b>traction</b> <b>effort</b> and fuel consumption per unit of area that can be used by farmers as a reference when working with trailed offset disc harrows, and secondly, to quantify the actual fuel savings that can be obtained by selecting an engine speed of about 80 % of rated speed, using the highest allowed gear ratio, by adjusting the tire inflation pressure and liquid ballast for each work situation (according to the coefficient of traction and traction-wheel slip) and adjusting the gang angle of the trailed disc harrow (and the working width and depth) to the soil conditions (soil type and moisture content) ...|$|E
