50|$|When {{a column}} {{is too long}} to be built or transported in one piece, {{it has to be}} {{extended}} or spliced at the construction site. A reinforced concrete column is extended by having the steel reinforcing bars protrude a few inches or feet above the top of the concrete, then placing the next level of reinforcing bars to overlap, and pouring the concrete of the next level. A steel column is extended by welding or bolting splice plates on the flanges and webs or walls of the columns to provide a few inches or feet of load transfer from the upper to the lower column section. A timber column is usually extended by the use of a steel tube or wrapped-around sheet-metal plate bolted onto the two connecting <b>timber</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The playshed is a {{symmetrical}} open timber structure, {{which is}} rectangular in plan. It has a gabled roof framed in large <b>timber</b> <b>sections</b> and clad in hand-split hardwood shingles. There is wide overhang {{on all four}} sides, leaving large gablets clad in weatherboard. There are metal ridge and hip cappings. The roof is supported on ten stop-chamferred square posts, about 140mm (6 inch) square, which are bolted to buddy posts of a similar size, all set into the ground. There is triangular strutting to these posts which is also stop-chamferred, but some are replaced and some are missing. There are 120mm. (5") square perimeter roof beams, and 190x70mm. (8"x3") tie-beams. Where the struts are missing, {{the quality of the}} workmanship is evident in the precision of the recessed housings.

40|$|A {{problem has}} been {{observed}} by many researchers regarding the cracks caused mainly by moisture variation in timber structures. However, this effect has been neglected over the past decades. In addition, many design codes {{do not have a}} room for a realistic formulation of the moisture diffusion and its effect in causing internal stress, deformation, and cracks. Moreover, if this effect occurs in connection areas, usually the weakest structural section, it has and also had shown a devastating effect on the service life of many wooden structures. In the current work, a Fickian moisture diffusion model is implemented by use of finite element simulation {{with the help of the}} commercial software ABAQUS for a dowelled beam column connection. The results of such moisture diffusion were used to analyse the stress situation inside the <b>timber</b> <b>section.</b> Moreover, an extended finite element method was applied in ABAQUS to investigate how moisture induced crack develops into the <b>timber</b> <b>section.</b> Furthermore, a parametric study was performed by using Python scripting to investigate the effect of dowel spacing (horizontal and vertical) and critical energy release rate on the development of the moisture-induced crack. The results obtained revealed that for the same material property when the dowel spacing increases (either horizontal or vertical) the crack length increases significantly. Likewise, the crack length increases when the critical energy release rate requirement of the timber is decreasing...|$|R
50|$|In the 1860s and 1870s the {{district}} between Enoggera Creek and Kedron Brook was occupied principally by farmers, tanneries along Kedron Brook, {{and middle class}} commuter families residing in semi-rural hilltop retreats - such as Daniel Rowntree Somerset's Rosemount (established in the late 1850s), and Justice Cockle's Oakwal (erected 1864-65). These estates were virtually self-supporting, with vegetable gardens, orchards, domestic livestock and dairies. On some properties, crops were cultivated also. Wilston, established in the mid-1870s {{at the pinnacle of}} William Wilson's career (during his period {{as a member of the}} Queensland Legislative Council), belonged to this tradition.In July 1876, James Cowlishaw called tenders for a villa residence at Enoggera for William Wilson, which is understood to refer to Wilston House. Early photographs (circa late 1870s) show a core in face brickwork, with verandahs on three sides (to the west, south and east), a rendered masonry portico to the southern front entrance, a <b>timber</b> <b>section</b> along the north (rear) side of the house with a bay window at the eastern end, and an attached timber kitchen wing at the rear of the main building. The <b>timber</b> <b>section</b> of the house is understood to have contained one large room at the eastern end, divided by two sets of cedar doors from two smaller rooms, possibly guest bedrooms, at the western end. The cedar doors could be opened out to create a ballroom. Whether this wing was part of the original design, or a slightly later addition, is not clear. The portico to the front entrance may be a later addition, as the roof slates continue behind the portico roof structure. Slightly later photographs, thought to have been taken during the Wilsons' residence and therefore prior to 1885, reveal that the core had been rendered and bay windows to the two front rooms (at the southeast and southwest corners of the house) had been added. These matched in design the bay window of the earlier <b>timber</b> <b>section</b> on the north side of the house. By this period, three terraces on the southern (front) side of the house had been established, with concreted steps leading to each. It is understood that the lower terrace contained a croquet or tennis lawn, on which a portable dance floor and marquee could be erected when the Wilsons entertained.|$|R

5000|$|RTÉ {{launched}} the last revamp while Kenny was host on Friday 7 September 2007 - involving {{a new set}} but retaining the title sequence in use since 2003. Designed by Darragh Treacy of RTÉ Production Design, that set consisted of metal, timber and polycarbonate, with carpet as a floor covering; it made for a more complex and layered background than the previous arrangement, and was heavily dependent on saturated lighting and modern construction materials. According to Treacy: [...] "I wanted something contemporary that would be architectural and structural, example the horizontal lines and boxes that you see running throughout the set. ... The {{back wall of the}} area has textured panels which just take the light beautifully and give a great three-dimensional effect. Then the polycarbonate boxes sit in front of that. The fins - the large <b>timber</b> <b>sections</b> - {{to the left of the}} chat area are replicated in the entertainment area as well, and are large pieces of timber with a paint finish that take the light." ...|$|E
50|$|The River Tyne at Wylam {{has been}} forded {{for a very}} long time but because of the {{industrial}} revolution in Great Britain, a more suitable method of crossing the river at this point was required to link the ironworks on the north bank with the railway on the south bank so that goods could be taken to Newcastle upon Tyne and other parts of the country. At this time there was a waggonway on the north bank but it only went as far as Lemington. In 1836 a bridge was built over the river constructed from <b>timber</b> <b>sections</b> supported on stone piers, carrying road traffic and a waggonway. In 1897 the bridge ceased to be used for carrying the waggonway because of the construction of Wylam Railway Bridge. In the same year the bridge was strengthened by being reconstructed using steel. A couple of years later in 1899 a new toll house was built on the north side of the bridge, although the original toll house on the south side still stood up until 1960. The toll for pedestrians to cross the bridge was one penny but in 1936 an opposition to the tolls led to their acquisition by Northumberland County Council. The bridge was strengthened again during World War II in 1942 so that tanks and other heavy military vehicles could use it. Improvements to the bridge continued in the 1950s when two piers were replaced because of erosion and in 1959 when the bridge was widened to 24 ft. Improvements continued as recently as 2007, when the railings were strengthened following a fatal car crash in which three people died.|$|E
