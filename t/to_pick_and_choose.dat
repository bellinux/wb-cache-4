5|$|On 19 February, Hausser's SS Panzer Corps {{was ordered}} to strike southwards, to provide a screen for the 4th Panzer Army's attack. Simultaneously, Army Detachment Hollidt {{was ordered to}} contain the {{continuing}} Soviet efforts to break through German lines. The 1st Panzer Army was ordered to drive north {{in an attempt to}} cut off and destroy Popov's Mobile Group, using accurate intelligence on Soviet strength which allowed the Wehrmacht <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>choose</b> their engagements and bring about tactical numerical superiority. The 1st and 4th Panzer Armies were also ordered to attack the overextended Soviet 6th Army and 1st Guards Army. Between 20–23 February, the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH) cut through the 6th Army's flank, eliminating the Soviet threat to the Dnieper River and successfully surrounding and destroying a number of Red Army units south of the Samara River. The 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich advanced in a northeastern direction, while the 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf was put into action on 22 February, advancing parallel to the Das Reich. These two divisions successfully cut the supply lines to the Soviet spearheads. First Panzer Army was able to surround and pocket Popov's Mobile Group by 24 February, although a sizable contingent of Soviet troops managed to escape north. On 22 February, alarmed by the success of the German counterattack, the Soviet Stavka ordered the Voronezh Front to shift the 3rd Tank Army and 69th Army south, in an effort to alleviate pressure on the Southwestern Front and destroy German forces in the Krasnograd area.|$|E
25|$|This is a {{book that}} contradicts itself a hundred times; {{but that is not}} a {{criticism}} of it, because its author thinks contradictions are a sign of intellectual ferment and vitality. This {{is a book}} that systematically distorts and selects historical evidence; but that is not a criticism, because its author thinks that all interpretations are biased, and she regards it as her duty <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>choose</b> her facts to favor her own brand of politics. This is a book full of vaporous, French-intellectual prose that makes Teilhard de Chardin sound like Ernest Hemingway by comparison; but that is not a criticism, because the author likes that sort of prose and has taken lessons in how to write it, and she thinks that plain, homely speech is part of a conspiracy to oppress the poor.|$|E

500|$|As well as {{the scale}} of the response, critics {{questioned}} the criteria against which patients were selected for evacuation. At first the UK was challenged over its decision to include only children in the transports while tens of thousands of adults remained wounded in the city. Sylvana Foa, spokesperson for the UNHCR, commented that Sarajevo should not be regarded as a [...] "supermarket" [...] of photogenic potential refugees, asking [...] "Does this mean Britain only wants to help children? Maybe it only wants children under six, or blond children, or blue-eyed children?" [...] Patrick Peillod, head of the United Nations medical evacuation committee, said that the UK had treated Bosnian children [...] "like animals in a zoo" [...] and was trying <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>choose</b> evacuees to suit a public relations agenda. When the government revised its approach and included adults on flights out of the city, claims were made that wounded combatants had been among those taken to the UK, Sweden, and Italy, and that patients had paid bribes {{to be included in the}} transports.|$|E

500|$|Davis gained {{international}} attention after her refusal to issue marriage licenses {{and the ensuing}} controversy her actions caused. Many legal experts asserted that Davis had no standing under the law to refuse to issue the licenses. Columbia Law School professor Katherine Franke said, [...] "Kim Davis has all sorts of religious liberty rights secured under the First Amendment and under other laws, {{but they are not}} at stake in this case. All she's asked to do with couples that come before her is certify that they've met the state requirements for marriage, so her religious opposition to same-sex marriage is absolutely irrelevant." [...] Professor Stephen Vladeck of American University's Washington College of Law said that Davis [...] "waived any right to have an objection to issuing same-sex marriage licenses when she ran for the job". Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin and others compared Davis' refusal to follow orders of the U.S. Supreme Court to Alabama Governor George Wallace's futile [...] "Stand in the Schoolhouse Door" [...] protest of desegregation in 1963. The Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT civil rights group, said, [...] "Ms. Davis has the fundamental right to believe what she likes... but as a public servant, she does not have the right <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>choose</b> which laws she will follow or which services she will provide." [...] Attorney and author Roberta A. Kaplan, who argued for the plaintiffs in United States v. Windsor, wrote that [...] "Kim Davis is the clearest example of someone who wants to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate, yet she swore an oath to uphold the Constitution. It is laughable that she can then decide which laws to enforce, which is why every decision in her case has gone against her." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Motoman SV 3 X {{manipulator}} {{was used}} <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> fruit <b>and</b> <b>chosen</b> as research object. Under the instance of known space coordinates {{of fruit and}} space position and pose of erect obstacle, a kind of multi-joint angle computation and path planning method for Motoman SV 3 X was proposed. Firstly, several sets of joint angles were computed according to relative space position between fruit and erect obstacle. And then, one set of joint angle was chosen as terminal angle of path planning. Finally, algorithm was used to plan a obstacle-avoiding path from start angle to terminal angle. The method solved the computation problem of multi-joint angle, and has universality for the problem of avoiding erect obstacle for fruit-picking manipulator. Simulation tests under the environment of Matlab showed that solved joint angles of manipulator can both make Motoman SV 3 X avoid erect obstacle and end-effector reach preconcerted position with given position error, and validated the correctness of the path planning method...|$|R

2500|$|According to {{the profit}} squeeze theory, profits fell {{essentially}} because, {{in the course}} of the long boom, unemployment had reduced to a low level. This allowed workers <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>choose</b> their jobs, meaning that employers had to pay extra to attract and keep their staff. The increased labor costs therefore [...] "squeezed" [...] profits. This could be sustained for some time, while markets were still growing, but at the expense of accelerating price inflation. In the 1970s, employers began to scale back their investments in production, and there was enormous political pressure on the state to curb wage increases and reduce price inflation, bringing the long post-war boom to an end. Orthodox Marxists however argued that the main cause of falling profits was the rising organic composition of capital, and not wage rises. On this view, the falling average rate of profit on production capital in the end choked off the growth of the total mass of profit, leading to a stagnation of business investment and rising unemployment.|$|E

The screenplay for Space Case was developed by Boam and screenwriter Richard Outten, and written by Outten.

40|$|Background - Supply is {{nowadays}} {{higher than}} the demand, {{making it possible for}} consumers <b>to</b> <b>pick,</b> <b>choose</b> <b>and</b> purchase brands that responds to their individual identity. Due to the numerous offerings available, consumers have started to become resistant and they are now withstanding the influence of brands marketing activities. The concept of brand avoidance is one type of personal anti-consumption behaviour which deals with understanding why consumers actively avoid purchasing a specific brand, although the consumer has the financial and physical abilities to do so. Purpose - People are deliberately avoiding brands due to their marketing communication, but the existing research of the underlying reasons are limited and unexplored. Knittel, Beurer and Berndt (2016) previously added advertising as a fifth reason for brand avoidance, though {{it is not clear whether}} there are further factors or reasons that affects brand avoidance. By using the elements in the IMC promotional mix as a base, all communication activities a brand is using are included, which makes the study more comprehensive. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate and gain a broader understanding of why consumers deliberately chose to avoid certain brands because of their marketing communication efforts. Method - To fulfil the purpose of the study, an exploratory research design with a qualitative and abductive approach was applied. In the data collection method, focus groups were used and complemented by semi-structured interviews. The aim of using such combination of methods is to limit the risks associated with only having one method for collecting data and further to increase the trustworthiness of this qualitative study. The participants in the study are self-supporting people over the age of 20, living in Sweden. Conclusion - The findings of the study resulted in a revised category called IMC avoidance, based on Knittel et al. ´s (2016) advertising avoidance. This, since findings showed that there are more communications tools than advertising that influences a brand avoidance behaviour. The IMC avoidance category includes six components: advertising, direct marketing, interactive/internet marketing, sales promotion, publicity/public relations and personal selling. Researchers within the subject area and marketing managers will benefit from this study in the future, as it contributed with findings within in the fields of brand avoidance, marketing communication and consumer behaviour. ...|$|R
