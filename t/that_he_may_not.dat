5|$|The Amaury Sport Organisation {{announced}} the wildcard entries to the Tour de France in January, much earlier in than in past years. Cofidis, who {{had participated in}} the Tour every year of their existence, were among the four teams added to the 18 UCI ProTeams obligated to attend. After not racing the Tour in 2010 and indicating at the time <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> return to it, Moncoutié decided instead to ride the 2011 Tour with hopes of winning the King of the Mountains title. The decision put a bit of doubt to his potential return to the Vuelta a España, notwithstanding the team needing a wildcard for that race as well, in spite of his three-year string of winning the mountains classification at that race. Taaramäe, Dumoulin, El Fares, and Vogondy were also named to the squad.|$|E
5|$|While Walter and Agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) {{ensure that}} the witness is safe at the hospital, Olivia takes Peter back to the lab. Peter, {{suffering}} from a headache, takes an aspirin and drinks out of what he believes to be an ordinary bottle of milk from the fridge. In reality, the milk contains a serum developed by Walter {{in order to help}} him recover his full mental function. However, the serum was incorrectly prepared, which causes Peter to begin convulsing. Over the phone, Walter directs Olivia to inject Peter with the correct compounds in order to save his life. Walter realizes that the serum would have killed him if he had consumed it, and that this was another step in the Observer's plot. Later that evening, September meets with another Observer, and identifies the fact that Walter was able to let Peter go, despite believing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> survive, and that when the time comes, they can expect Walter to do it again.|$|E

25|$|The {{story is}} {{loosely based on}} a 1926 short story by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, {{published}} in Chūōkōron in September 1926. The film opens {{as an artist and}} a young woman are in a dentist's waiting room. Though he is attracted to the woman, he says nothing to her. They are later in the same examining room. When the artist is given an anaesthetic, he begins to imagine a series of scenes in which the woman undergoes various forms of sexual abuse at the hand of the dentist, including rape and torture. When the artist recovers from the anaesthetic, he finds bite marks on the woman's breast, indicating <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have been hallucinating.|$|E

Joy is horrified when she awakens and sees their interaction, slapping Old Nick away. As punishment, he cuts their heat and power. Joy decides to tell Jack about the outside world; he reacts with disbelief and incomprehension, but also curiosity. She has Jack fake a fever, hoping that Old Nick will take him to a hospital where he can alert the authorities, but Old Nick says he will return the following day with antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|Revis {{entered the}} 2012 season hinting <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> attend {{training}} camp, {{with the hope}} of reworking his contract. Despite the uncertainty regarding his contract status, Revis attended training camp. The Jets' season opener was played against the Buffalo Bills on September 9, 2012. Revis intercepted a Ryan Fitzpatrick pass which set up a Mark Sanchez touchdown on the ensuing drive. The Jets would go on to defeat the Bills 48–28. Revis recorded five tackles in addition to the interception but was taken out of the game in the fourth quarter after teammate Bart Scott accidentally hit Revis in the head with his knee while Revis was still on the ground. Revis was diagnosed with a mild concussion and subsequently ruled out for Week 2 against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He returned the following week against the Miami Dolphins where he recovered a fumble but later left the game with an undisclosed knee injury. An MRI taken the following day revealed Revis suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and would be out {{for the remainder of the}} season. He was placed on injured reserve on October 12, 2012.|$|E

500|$|As Mulder remembers it, {{that night}} he found Schaefer, in a dazed state, walking naked down a highway in Klass County. After getting him some clothes, Mulder takes Schaefer to a diner, where the pilot {{explains}} {{that he and his}} partner were dressed as aliens while flying a secret U.S. military vehicle designed to resemble a UFO. He thinks that he, his partner, and the two teenagers were abducted by real aliens in a real UFO, but Schaefer is also unsure if his surroundings are real or a hallucination, and he tells Mulder <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> even exist himself, as he cannot be sure.

500|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Abdallah al-Battal's origin or early life. Much later {{accounts}} claim that he hailed from Antioch or Damascus, {{and that he was}} a mawla of the Umayyad family. He is also given various kunya, Abu Muhammad, Abu Yahya, or Abu 'l-Husayn, by which he is usually known. The use of the nisba of al-Antaqi ("of Antioch") rather than a tribal affiliation suggests <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have been of Arab origin; in this context, his name [...] "Abdallah" [...] further suggests that he was a convert to Islam, as this name (meaning [...] "servant of Allah") was often given to new converts in early Islamic times. Khalid Yahya Blankinship suggested that he might be the same person as a certain [...] "'Amr" [...] recorded by the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor in the Nicaea campaign of 727, and hence that [...] "'Amr" [...] could be his actual personal name or a patronymic (i.e. his name could be 'Amr ibn Abdallah or Abdallah ibn 'Amr), while alternatively [...] "Abdallah" [...] could simply be an honorific.|$|E
500|$|Whitman had intense {{friendships with}} many {{men and boys}} {{throughout}} his life. Some biographers have suggested <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have actually engaged in sexual relationships with males, while others cite letters, journal entries, and other sources that they claim as proof of the sexual nature {{of some of his}} relationships. English poet and critic John Addington Symonds spent 20 years in correspondence trying to pry the answer from him. In 1890 he wrote to Whitman, [...] "In your conception of Comradeship, do you contemplate the possible intrusion of those semi-sexual emotions and actions which no doubt do occur between men?" [...] In reply, Whitman denied that his work had any such implication, asserting [...] "hat the calamus part has even allow'd the possibility of such construction as mention'd is terrible—I am fain to hope the pages themselves are not to be even mention'd for such gratuitous and quite at this time entirely undream'd & unreck'd possibility of morbid inferences—wh' are disavow'd by me and seem damnable," [...] and insisting that he had fathered six illegitimate children.
