Wooden postcards light enough for the postcard rate required 1 cent postage until 1952; 2 cents from 1952 to 1958; and 3 cents from 1958 to 1963. The postage rates were once commonly printed on the cards.|$|R

50|$|The {{postage meter}} {{normally}} {{consists of a}} keyboard for entering the postage, three seals, and a stamping mechanism. Years ago, users needed to take their meter to a postal office in order to add additional postage (sometimes called a “reset” or “refill”). That changed in 1979 when Pitney Bowes invented remote meter resetting, otherwise known as Postage by Phone. Today, users can add to their postage balance by telephone, prepaid cards, via the web or through a direct connection over the Internet. The first counter shows the remaining balance. The second counter shows the <b>total</b> <b>postage</b> of the franked consignments. The third one counts the number of prints and is for statistic purposes only.|$|R

The design, a portrait of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, the parish priest who led an unsuccessful bid for Mexican independence in 1810, reflected the reform politics of the Comonfort government. The stamps were somewhat crudely engraved and imperforate. Five values were issued from 1856-1859; ½ real, 1r, 2r, 4r, and 8r. The stamps usually, but not always, had district overprints with the name of the district post office.|$|R
