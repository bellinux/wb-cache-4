40|$|Cancer is a {{significant}} health care concern worldwide that is often treated by using chemotherapy. Nurses working in Oncology/Hematology are not only responsible for the administration of chemotherapy agents but also play {{a significant}} role in teaching patients about their treatments. From my personal experience as an Oncology/Hematology nurse, I noted barriers to providing effective patient chemotherapy education which led to inconsistencies in the teaching being provided. From these observations, the idea of a resource manual was constructed. <b>To</b> <b>substantiate</b> <b>the</b> felt <b>need</b> for a resource manual a comprehensive literature review as well as key stake holder consultations were conducted. The management of nausea and vomiting for individuals undergoing chemotherapy was identified as a priority need. This report provides an overview of the findings of the literature review and key stake holder consultations. Findings were used in conjunction with Morrison, Ross, Kalman and Kemp’s (2013) instructional design model and Knowles Principles of Adult Learning (1984) to develop this manual.

Major findings from the study include: 1. The public has a real need for weather information in the 0 - 6 hour bracket. 2. The visual medium is preferred but due to the lack of frequent (0 - 6 hours) forecasts, the audio media only, i. e., telephone recordings and radio weathercasts, were more frequently used. 3.

Over its 28-year existence, ACUS served as an independent agency charged with studying [...] "the efficiency, adequacy, and fairness of the administrative procedure used by administrative agencies in carrying out administrative programs." [...] Most of its approximately 200 recommendations were implemented, and they, in turn, helped save taxpayers many millions of dollars. ACUS {{was considered to be}} [...] "an invaluable mechanism set into place by Congress to improve federal administrative law." [...] A commentator observed that [...] "as long as {{there is a need for}} regulatory reform, there is a need for something like the Administrative Conference." [...] ACUS is credited with playing an important role in improving the nation's legal system by issuing recommendations designed [...] "to eliminate excessive litigation costs and long delays." [...] For example, Congress, in response to an ACUS recommendation, passed the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act in 1990, which established a framework for agencies to resolve administrative litigation through alternative dispute resolution. [...] Among its [...] "most influential government-wide recommendations" [...] were ACUS's proposals facilitating judicial review of agency decisions and eliminating various technical impediments to such review. [...] It also issued proposals leading to the enactment of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act, which encourages consensual resolution through a process that takes into account <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of various affected interests.

This paper addresses these limitations by introducing the cost model for a fault tolerant system taking into account the reliability factor of a system. This model will help designers analyze the need for a fault tolerant system and its feasibility in the industry. This paper models the costs involved during the life cycle of a chip.

40|$|Anaphora occurs very {{frequently}} in written texts and spoken dialogues. Almost all NLP {{applications such as}} machine translation, information extraction, automatic summarization, question answering system, natural language generation, etc., require successful identification and resolution of anaphora.

In this paper, we present a review of work done in the field of anaphora resolution in Hindi. We also cover different issues and challenges in developing computational models for Hindi [...] The paper covers issues related to syntactic/semantic structure of Hindi and influence of cases on pronouns, mainly personal pronoun. The work is mainly dedicated to pronominal anaphora. As the pronouns in Hindi do not differentiate gender, it is the verb and case markers that signify different genders. Influence of case markers in deciding the antecedent is explored.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2002 In Alaska, {{contemporary}} Native {{artists are}} creating compelling works of art, yet, {{in the literature}} and exhibitions about Native North American contemporary art, Alaska Native art receives little if any attention. In this study, I assess how contemporary Alaska Native art is presented to the public to evaluate whether these representations marginalize this artwork. I examine the creation, exhibition and reception of contemporary Alaska Native art based on the perspectives of the artists, exhibit evaluations and viewer responses. My goal {{in this study is}} <b>to</b> <b>substantiate</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to address the way Alaska Native art is presented and to analyze current practices. In particular, I seek to emphasize the importance of creating contextualized presentations of contemporary Alaska Native art using multiple perspectives and interpretive media based on collaboration between the exhibitors of public art and Native artists and communities. By creating more inclusive, informative representations of Alaska Native art, presentations can begin to address the differing requirements of a variety of audiences, utilize the critical attention given to Native American and Euro-American art elsewhere and provoke a re-thinking of preconceptions that continue to diminish the accomplishments of Alaska Native artists...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of Science and Technology has bolstered {{the use of}} English Language around the world. The purpose of teaching English to non-native speakers of English is to help them in communicating, and more precisely sharing knowledge and information with speakers of other languages. In the field of higher education, the learners need English for Academic purposes (EAP) and learn to use it later for occupational purposes (EOP). Students who had their primary education in English, manage to cope up with this way of the world; whereas students from sub-standard schools or vernacular medium of instruction, many times {{find it very difficult}} to cope up with the trend. This paper analyses the need to teach technical writing as a course to students of technical education in order to make them competent in academics and later in their work place.

40|$|Transnationalism as {{perspective}} {{study of}} {{new forms of}} migration has gained importance in recent decades, showing that many migrants have closed and sustained links with their home communities. Many transnational studies focus on the identification and enumeration of transnational activities of migrants to differentiate what is a transnational migration than it is not. We proceed from the assumption that transnational activity manifested does not necessarily match with the potential insofar as factors that influence it change. Among these factors is the Law and the rules on foreigners´ residence and stay permits. The article aims <b>to</b> <b>substantiate</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to open a space for reflection and a solid line of research {{that focuses on the}} impact of the law on the creation or impeding the migrant transnationalism. To do this we rely on the information provided by a comprehensive study on the Andean population in the Basque Country (604 respondant survey and 35 interviews-in-depth) which give us solid evidence to support further research. These findings show how there are migration decisions and activities transnational that migrants undertake forced by specific norms (induced trasnationalism); while in other cases, migrants would like to engage in transnational relations with origin (or third countries) but the legal conditions surrounding them which prevent them from them (latent transnationalism) ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is <b>to</b> <b>substantiate</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for {{eliminating}} the excessive spatial polarization of territorial socio-economic development as a necessary condition for advanced development of human resources potential. The authors explore the basic problems and contradictions of modern regional and local labor markets in Russia. Based on generalization and systematization of foreign and domestic research outcomes, the paper reveals the main condition for eliminating the territorial polarization threats, which implies formation of a new institutional environment in order to provide co-operation of participants in the territorial interest zone in personnel training and new jobs creating. The research findings demonstrate the increased disproportions between the workforce and labor markets of municipal formations in Sverdlovsk region, and emphasize the need for territorial industrial educational clusters maximizing the network co-operation of the involved parties. The scientific novelty combines adaptation of theoretical concepts of the “new economic geography” applied to reorganization processes in the Russian economy; and elaboration of the cluster model of advanced development of territorial human resources potential by means of territorial centers coordinating the interests of administration, business society, and households. Practical significance of the research results is related to facilitating the administrative efficiency of regional and municipal formations, employers, territorial employment centers, and thereby the advanced development of human resources potential. </p...|$|E

The chapter is designed in a manner that promotes knowledge development and inspiration, and for the more proactive reader a rich experience of colour can be gained by working through the chapter activities, initially at a computer and later with pigments (paints, dyes), which is highly encouraged and recommended. This workshop approach enables you to experiment with colour mixing and colour schemes to better appreciate colour and its application, without which the theories become just a concept; there really is little substitute for experimentation. A short history of colour is given that focuses on the building of the scientific underpinning of the most predominant theories of colour used today in relation to textile-based products (fashion). Insight is also given into colour psychology in relation to creating colour-ways, colour ranges and colour themes and to colour forecasting. Colour terminology is given and discussed throughout the chapter and the following fundamental theories and colour characteristics are also discussed: •	The principles of additive colour mixing and subtractive colour mixing •	The six-hue colour wheel and the twelve-hue colour wheel •	Colour schemes and colour combinations •	Metamerism •	Colour deficiency (colour blindness) •	Colour measuremen...|$|E
