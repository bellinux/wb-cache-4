5|$|After 1912 thirty-one M7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} push-pull train capabilities with {{the provision of}} a primitive cable and pulley device. This was a modification {{that was designed to}} save time on country branch lines where the locomotive would usually have <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>around</b> its train {{in order to make a}} return journey. As a result, it was possible for the driver to drive his train from a cab located at the front of a designated push-pull coach, leaving the fireman to tend the fire and operate the injectors on the locomotive footplate.|$|E
5|$|Aided by his serve, Raonic employs an all-court {{style with}} an {{emphasis}} on short points. His groundstrokes are both good, but his forehand is stronger than his backhand. Because of this, he has been known <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>around</b> his backhand and hit inside-out forehands instead. He attempts to dictate play and is generally more aggressive than his opponent, as evidenced by usually having more winners and more unforced errors. To finish points quickly, Raonic occasionally approaches the net, with either a serve and volley or chip and charge strategy.|$|E

5|$|Basic indoor venues may {{be adapted}} gymnasiums, which can easily {{accommodate}} high jump competitions and short track events. Full-size indoor arenas (i.e. those fully equipped to host all events for the World Indoor Championships) bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents. Typically, a central area {{is surrounded by}} a 200-metre oval track with four to eight lanes. The track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>around</b> the radius more comfortably. Some have a second running track going straight across the field area, parallel to the straights of the main circuit. This track is used for the 60 metres and 60 metres hurdles events, which are held almost exclusively indoors.|$|E
5|$|While games such as Street Fighter and Tekken require {{players to}} {{memorize}} relatively lengthy and complicated button-input combinations often specific {{to only a}} particular character, Super Smash Bros. uses the same control combinations to access all moves for all characters. Characters are additionally not limited to only facing opponents, instead being allowed <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>around</b> freely on the stage. The game focuses more on aerial and platforming skills than other fighting games, with relatively larger, more-dynamic stages rather than a simple flat platform. Smash Bros. also implements blocking and dodging mechanics. Grabbing and throwing other characters is also possible.|$|E
5|$|M-80 {{starts at}} exit378 along Interstate 75 (I-75) near Kinross. A short section of it runs {{concurrently}} with H-63 (Mackinac Trail) {{to connect to}} ramps in the interchange. This section runs northeast–southwest across the freeway from Mud Lake before the M-80 designation turns southeasterly along Tone Road running past Kinross Lake in a forested area. Tone Road curves sharply northeasterly and then southeasterly <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>around</b> {{the north end of}} the runway complex at the Chippewa County International Airport. The highway runs due east past the airport terminal area to the south and a prison and the residential area of the former Kincheloe Air Force Base to the north. Near Dukes Lake, M-80 crosses Gaines Highway and leaves the former base and runs through forest to the intersection with M-129 where M-80 terminates. The roadway continues eastward as 17Mile Road in Pickford Township.|$|E

When the body was cut down, Howell started stamping on Frank's face and chest; Morris quickly placed the body in a basket, and he and his driver John Stephens Wood drove it out of Marietta.|$|E
5|$|Thutmose I {{organized}} great {{building projects}} during his reign, including many temples and tombs, but his greatest projects {{were at the}} Temple of Karnak {{under the supervision of}} the architect Ineni. Previous to Thutmose, Karnak probably consisted only of a long road to a central platform, with a number of shrines for the solar bark along the side of the road. Thutmose was the first king to drastically enlarge the temple. Thutmose had the fifth pylon built along the temple's main road, along with a wall <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>around</b> the inner sanctuary and two flagpoles to flank the gateway. Outside of this, he built a fourth pylon and another enclosure wall. Between pylons four and five, he had a hypostyle hall constructed, with columns made of cedar wood. This type of structure was common in ancient Egyptian temples, and supposedly represents a papyrus marsh, an Egyptian symbol of creation. Along the edge of this room he built colossal statues, each one alternating wearing the crown of Upper Egypt and the crown of Lower Egypt. Finally, outside of the fourth pylon, he erected four more flagpoles and two obelisks, although one of them, which now has fallen, was not inscribed until Thutmose III inscribed it about 50 years later. The cedar columns in Thutmose I's hypostyle hall were replaced with stone columns by Thutmose III, however at least the northernmost two were replaced by Thutmose I himself. Hatshepsut also erected two of her own obelisks inside of Thutmose I's hypostyle hall.|$|E
25|$|Another {{scene in}} the film recreates the Great Court Run, in which the runners attempt <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>around</b> the {{perimeter}} of the Great Court at Trinity College, Cambridge {{in the time it takes}} the clock to strike 12 at midday. The film shows Abrahams performing the feat for the first time in history. In fact, Abrahams never attempted this race, and at the time of filming the only person on record known to have succeeded was Lord Burghley, in 1927. In Chariots of Fire, Lindsay, who is based on Lord Burghley, runs the Great Court Run with Abrahams in order to spur him on, and crosses the finish line just a moment too late. Since the film's release, the Great Court Run has also been successfully run by Trinity undergraduate Sam Dobin, in October 2007.|$|E

25|$|Forwards tend to run {{straight}} and {{hard at the}} opposition, while the backs run at gaps between players or use speed and guile <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>around</b> them. In modern games of rugby some backs can {{be as big as}} forwards and attempt to break through the defensive line using brute force and many forwards possess the running skills of backs. Players run straight at the opposition with the aim of either breaking the tackle or getting forward momentum from which to set up another attack. If they are close to the try line they can drive in low to aid grounding the ball. Players can also try to break through tackles by spinning after making contact or by using the hand not carrying the ball to fend (push) off the defender.|$|E
25|$|While in battle, {{characters}} {{status is}} displayed in special {{windows on the}} battle screen: their window shows their current health, their Blast gauge (an energy bar linked to special abilities), and Spirit Chain (SC) gauge, which fuels the ability to link characters and perform special attacks. A high level of SC points grants conditional boons to characters, such as dealing higher damage and faster recovery of SC. Characters {{have the option to}} side-step (dodge forward, backward or to the side), and precisely timed dodges can allow characters to stagger enemies and fill the SC gauge. The Blast gauge allows characters to trigger a blast of energy which knocks enemies back and heals injuries. The SC gauge allows for a maximum of four linked attacks, and any remaining points in the gauge can be used for later linked attacks. The order of activation for linked attacks cannot be changed. At the end of battles, if certain requirements are fulfilled, characters can learn skills called Battle Acts, abilities that grant the characters advantages in battle, such as being able <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>around</b> the field freely.|$|E

David Foster Wallace compared the brute force of Federer's forehand motion with that of [...] "a great liquid whip", while John McEnroe has referred to Federer's forehand as [...] "the greatest shot in our sport."
