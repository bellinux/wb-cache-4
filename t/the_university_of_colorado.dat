5|$|In Yellowstone's hot waters, {{bacteria}} form mats {{of bizarre}} shapes consisting of trillions of individuals. These bacteria {{are some of}} the most primitive life forms on earth. Flies and other arthropods live on the mats, even in the middle of the bitterly cold winters. Initially, scientists thought that microbes there gained sustenance only from sulfur. In 2005 researchers from <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Colorado</b> at Boulder discovered that the sustenance for at least some of the diverse hyperthermophilic species is molecular hydrogen.|$|E

When tasked three years later by friend Brian Graden to create another short as a video Christmas card that he could send to friends, Parker and Stone created another similarly-animated The Spirit of Christmas short, dubbed Jesus vs. Santa. In this short, Kenny is given his first name, and first appears as he does in the series.|$|E

5|$|McConnell {{was raised}} in Colorado and after {{studying}} chemistry she became a high school teacher. She later attended medical school at <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Colorado</b> Denver, graduating in 1925.

In addition to working as Denver's city toxicologist, she held positions in multiple hospitals and administrative boards. After battling lifelong health problems, including rheumatic heart disease and a leg amputation, McConnell died in 1975. She was posthumously inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Research {{focused on}} four {{individual}} days that accumulated more than 5.9 inches (15cm) of hail in 30 {{minutes on the}} Colorado front range has shown that these events share similar patterns in observed synoptic weather, radar, and lightning characteristics, suggesting the possibility of predicting these events prior to their occurrence. A fundamental problem in continuing {{research in this area}} is that, unlike hail diameter, hail depth is not commonly reported. The lack of data leaves researchers and forecasters in the dark when trying to verify operational methods. A cooperative effort between <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Colorado</b> and the National Weather Service is in progress. The joint project's goal is to enlist the help of the general public to develop a database of hail accumulation depths.|$|E
