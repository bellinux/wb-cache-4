5|$|Susan {{attempts}} to console Edie's husband, Dave Williams (Neal McDonough), following Edie's death. She explains the truth behind her own accident, completely unaware that Lila and Paige Dash were Dave's wife and daughter, respectively, {{and that he}} had been seeking revenge on Mike since moving to Wisteria Lane. Meanwhile, Jackson returns to Fairview and proposes to Susan, revealing that his visa has expired and he needs to marry an American citizen. When Susan learns that Mike, who is engaged to Katherine, will no longer have to pay alimony once she is married, she explains the false pretenses of her engagement. Dave, who now understands that Susan was driving the car that killed his family, overhears this and reports Jackson to immigration officials. With Jackson out of the picture, Dave invites Susan and M.J. on a fishing <b>trip,</b> <b>planning</b> to kill M.J. just like Susan killed his own child. Mike discovers Dave's plans and is able to save Susan and M.J. After the ordeal, Susan and Mike share a brief, yet romantic kiss. Dave is sent to a psychiatric hospital in Boston and two months later, Mike marries an unidentified bride.|$|E

25|$|After an {{extended}} period of popular dissatisfaction and economic decline under the neoliberal administration of Carlos Andrés Pérez, Chávez made extensive preparations for a military-civilian coup d'état. Initially planned for December 1991, Chávez delayed the MBR-200 coup until the early twilight hours of February 4, 1992. Chávez at the time held the loyalty of some 10% of Venezuela's military forces. On that date, five army units under Chávez's command moved into urban Caracas to seize key military and communications installations throughout the city, including the presidential residence (Miraflores Palace), the defense ministry, La Carlota military airport, and the Military Museum. Chávez's ultimate goal was to intercept Pérez, take custody of him and allegedly execute him before he returned to Miraflores from an overseas <b>trip,</b> <b>planning</b> to capture the president at Maiquetía airport.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, the County Connection {{partnered with}} Moore & Associates, Inc., a public transit {{marketing}} firm, {{to develop and}} produce a targeted Spanish language outreach program. This resulted in the transit agency's Amigos de Viajar program. The program was created to provide one-on-one instructional outreach to Spanish-speaking persons within Concord's Monument Corridor community. As a result, 12 volunteers were trained in how to provide fellow community members with <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> assistance. The volunteers, identified by their high-visibility yellow vests, {{can be seen at}} area bus stops, transit centers, and aboard the County Connection's buses. Developed in support of the program, Moore & Associates scripted and produced a nine-minute film outlining the public transportation options in Contra Costa County, benefits of utilizing public transportation, detailed illustrations on how to ride transit, and options with connecting transit systems - including BART and AC Transit, among others. The film was printed to DVD and distributed to organizations throughout the Monument community and greater Concord.|$|E

40|$|The {{rail freight}} carload service segment enables the {{distribution}} of freight volumes down to the unit of single rail cars, and stand as an important alternative to road transportation. However, this service segment {{is often associated with}} significant uncertainties and variations in daily freight volumes. Such uncertainties are challenging to manage since operating plans generally are established long in advance of operations. Flexibility can instead be found in the way <b>trip</b> <b>plans</b> are generated. Previous research has shown that a commonly used <b>trip</b> <b>plan</b> generation policy does not exploit the available flexibility to the full extent. In this paper, we therefore suggest an optimization-based freight routing and scheduling (OFRS) policy to address the rail freight <b>trip</b> <b>plan</b> generation problem. This OFRS-policy generates <b>trip</b> <b>plans</b> for rail cars while still restricted by the customer commitments. The policy involves a MIP formulation with a continuous time representation and is solved by commercial software. We apply the OFRS-policy on a case built on real data provided by the Swedish rail freight operator, Green Cargo, and assess the performance of the policy comparing the current industry practice. The results show that by using the OFRS policy, we can achieve a reduction in the total transportation times, number of shunting activities and potentially also a reduction in the service frequency given the considered transport demand.

50|$|This {{step is to}} read {{individual}} activities previously generated, then {{determine the}} fastest route {{at that time of}} the day. The route planner has several features. Households are routed in a coordinated fashion to allow for ride sharing. The algorithm includes time-dependent optimization of the network based on link delays that vary during the day. The router does not choose the transportation mode but finds the best route given the mode. The router starts by using well-known traffic assignment function BPR+ to estimate link delays {{based on the number of}} trips routed through each link. It then determines the optimal route for each trip and creates precise <b>trip</b> <b>plans.</b> A <b>trip</b> <b>plan</b> is a sequence of modes, routes, and planned departure and arrival times at the origin and destinations, and mode changing facilities projected to move individuals to activity locations.|$|R

40|$|Recently, the {{management}} of transportation systems has become increasingly important in many real applications such as location-based services, supply chain management, traffic control, and so on. These applications usually involve queries over spatial road networks with dynamically changing and complicated traffic conditions. In this paper, we model such a network by a probabilistic time-dependent graph (PT-Graph), whose edges are associated with uncertain delay functions. We propose a useful query in the PT-Graph, namely a trip planner query (TPQ), which retrieves <b>trip</b> <b>plans</b> that traverse a set of query points in PT-Graph, having the minimum traveling time with high confidence. To tackle the efficiency issue, we present the pruning methods time interval pruning and probabilistic pruning to effectively rule out false alarms of <b>trip</b> <b>plans.</b> Furthermore, we design a pre-computation technique based on the cost model and construct an index structure over the pre-computed data to enable the pruning via the index. We integrate our proposed pruning methods into an efficient query procedure to answer TPQs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our TPQ query answering approach...|$|R
