Civil liberties, freedom of speech, privacy, etc. have been decreasing since 9/11. The sun in the image could either be setting or rising and this ambiguity shows that there is still hope to turn things around... The U.S. is the dominant global force.

25|$|Hearing {{begins in}} utero, but the central {{auditory}} system continues to develop {{for at least}} the first decade. There is considerable interest in the idea that disruption to hearing during a sensitive period may have long-term consequences for auditory development. One study showed thalamocortical connectivity in vitro was associated with a <b>time</b> <b>sensitive</b> developmental window and required a specific cell adhesion molecule (lcam5) for proper brain plasticity to occur. This points to connectivity between the thalamus and cortex shortly after being able to hear (in vitro) as at least one critical period for auditory processing. Another study showed that rats reared in a single tone environment during critical periods of development had permanently impaired auditory processing. ‘Bad’ auditory experiences, such as temporary deafness by cochlear removal in rats leads to neuron shrinkage. In a study looking at attention in APD patients, children with one ear blocked developed a strong right-ear advantage but were not able to modulate that advantage during directed-attention tasks.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "schizoid" [...] {{was coined}} in 1908 by Eugen Bleuler to {{designate}} a human tendency to direct attention toward one's inner life {{and away from}} the external world, a concept akin to introversion in that it was not viewed in terms of psychopathology. Bleuler labeled the exaggeration of this tendency the “schizoid personality.” He described these personalities as [...] "comfortably dull and at the same <b>time</b> <b>sensitive,</b> people who in a narrow manner pursue vague purposes".|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{treatment}} involves {{stabilizing the}} patient enough to ensure adequate airway, breathing, and circulation, and identifying other injuries. [...] Surgery {{may be needed}} to repair injured organs. Surgical exploration is necessary for people with penetrating injuries and signs of peritonitis or shock. [...] Laparotomy is often performed in blunt abdominal trauma, and is urgently required if an abdominal injury causes a large, potentially deadly bleed. The main goal is to stop any sources of bleeding before moving onto any definitive find and repair any injuries that are found. Due to the <b>time</b> <b>sensitive</b> nature, this procedure also emphasizes expedience in terms of gaining access and controlling the bleeding, thus favoring a long midline incession. Intra-abdominal injuries are also frequently successfully treated nonoperatively as there is little benefit shown if there is no known active bleeding or potential for infection. The use of CT scanning allows care providers to use less surgery because they can identify injuries that can be managed conservatively and rule out other injuries that would need surgery. [...] Depending on the injuries, a patient may or may not need intensive care.|$|E
40|$|The {{tendency}} of platelets and leukocytes to lyse after their interaction with antibody and complement was studied {{by measuring the}} release of 51 Cr from cells labeled with this isotope. Platelets from six patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) were 15 - 230 <b>times</b> more <b>sensitive</b> to antibodies and 10 - 32 <b>times</b> more <b>sensitive</b> to complement than normal platelets or platelets from patients {{with other types of}} thrombocytopenic or hemolytic disorders.

PNH platelets, like PNH erythrocytes, lysed more readily than normal platelets in acidified serum and in media of reduced ionic strength, but these characteristics were not demonstrable with PNH WBC's under the conditions of study. In PNH, platelets appear to comprise a single population with respect to their sensitivity to immune lysis, yet their survival time as measured with 51 Cr falls within normal limits. PNH granulocytes likewise appear to consist of a single, uniformly sensitive population...|$|R

2500|$|Grand Trunk Western was one {{of three}} Michigan railroads, along with the Ann Arbor Railroad and Pere Marquette Railway, that {{operated}} separate railcar ferry service across Lake Michigan between Michigan and Wisconsin. Loading rail cars onto ships that had rails mounted to their decks, and ferrying the cars east and west across Lake Michigan, allowed railroads to bypass the congested rail interchanges in Chicago and move <b>time</b> <b>sensitive</b> freight more quickly. GTW's ferry service was originally operated by the former Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway (DGH) which Grand Trunk Railway acquired in 1882. [...] DGH initially had agreements with ferry companies operating on Lake Michigan to transfer its passengers and freight onto ships bound for Milwaukee form Grand Haven, Michigan. GTW's rail car ferry service began in 1902 with an operating agreement with the steamship company, Crosby Transportation Company. The railway constructed ferry slip docks at Grand Haven and Milwaukee and had two steamships built, the SS Grand Haven and SS Milwaukee, capable of carrying 26 freight railcars. In 1905 Grand Trunk assumed Crosby's interest and incorporated the Grand Trunk Milwaukee Car Ferry Company to operate the ships. [...] In Milwaukee GTW interchanged rail cars with The Milwaukee Road, Chicago and North Western and the Soo Line. The ownership of the ferry company was shared with the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) from 1927 until 1954 and sailed as the Grand Trunk-Pennsylvania Route. The SS Milwaukee sank loaded with rail cars in a storm after departing Milwaukee in October 1929 with everyone aboard lost. [...] Three new ships, the Grand Rapids, Madison, and the City of Milwaukee constructed between 1926 and 1931, replaced the Grand Haven and Milwaukee. The ships required a crew of 34 and with strengthen ice breaking hauls operated year round. On PRR's request GTW moved its Michigan docks to Muskegon in 1937 where its subsidiary the Muskegon Railway and Navigation Company initially operated ferry loading and switching operations. GTW had also changed its route into Muskegon with trackage rights over PRR's line from Grand Rapids. [...] By 1968 GTW was shipping over [...] of freight a year across Lake Michigan. However, the ferry service began running deficits of over $1 million annually in the 1970s and in 1975 GTW petitioned the ICC to end the service. Permission was eventually granted and the last ferry sailed on October 31, 1978.|$|E
