5|$|Several {{measures}} {{can be taken}} to control infection in aquaculture once an S.iniae outbreak has been confirmed. Decreasing the quantity of feed given <b>to</b> <b>fish</b> has been shown to reduce mortality rates, as the uptake of bacteria in water is expedited by feeding. Decreasing the density of the fish stock increases survival by reducing injury <b>to</b> <b>fish</b> and lowering the general stress level in the population. Lowering the water temperature and keeping optimal oxygen levels has also been shown to reduce stress <b>to</b> <b>fish</b> and inhibit bacterial growth.|$|E
5|$|Animal welfare advocates raise {{concerns}} about the possible suffering of fish caused by angling. Some countries, such as Germany have banned specific types of fishing, and the British RSPCA now formally prosecutes individuals who are cruel <b>to</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|E

5|$|Members of this {{community}} also herd zebu and catch fish in Lake Alaotra. The work of fishing was traditionally subdivided by gender: men were only allowed <b>to</b> <b>fish</b> for eels, while women were tasked to use nets to catch small fish, and children {{were the only ones}} allowed <b>to</b> <b>fish</b> using poles.

5|$|Fishing {{is popular}} in the park. Some of the finest fly fishing in North America {{can be found in}} the streams that flow through Glacier National Park. Though the park {{requires}} that those fishing understand the regulations, no permit is required <b>to</b> <b>fish</b> the waters within the park boundary. The threatened bull trout must be released immediately back to the water if caught; otherwise, the regulations on limits of catch per day are liberal.|$|E
5|$|For 15,000 years, {{native peoples}} {{gathered}} at Wyam <b>to</b> <b>fish</b> and exchange goods.

Historically, an estimated fifteen to twenty million salmon passed through the falls every year, {{making it one of the}} greatest fishing sites in North America.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, the LISPC {{approved}} $37,000 (1947USD) {{to construct}} a stone ornate gasoline station along the Meadowbrook in Jones Beach State Park. The gas station, one of eight constructed by Robert Moses throughout Long Island, would serve drivers, when there were fewer stations throughout the area. After 1975, NYSDOT, who {{took control of the}} parkways from the LISPC, started demolishing some of the stations, including the Meadowbrook, which ended up being one of the first buildings to go. The stations, which were once useful, would fork from the left lane into the median. However, according to NYSDOT, with the change in traffic patterns, the entrances to these stations became dangerous. By 1997, over two decades after demolition, the station site became a problematic place for people parking and walking up the Meadowbrook and Loop <b>to</b> <b>fish</b> on the bridges. According to the New York State Police, the site is legal for use as a repair stop or for emergencies. However, not for use of dropping people off for fishing, which is also illegal <b>to</b> <b>fish</b> from atop the bridge, except it is around and under the bridges.|$|E

5|$|Like many ancient {{medicinal}} plants (Pliny the Elder describes {{it in his}} Naturalis Historia), great mullein was linked to witches, although the relationship remained generally ambiguous, and the plant was also widely held to ward off curses and evil spirits.

5|$|A few lemurs {{have been}} noted to have {{relatively}} large brains.

5|$|A few species, the Caribbean fire sponge Tedania ignis, cause {{a severe}} rash in humans who handle them. Turtles and some fish feed mainly on sponges.

5|$|At these sites, {{the study}} also found averages of 1.7, 2.23, and 5.56 parts per million of aluminum, respectively.

The toxicity of aluminum <b>to</b> <b>fish</b> is increased by a water pH of below 4.5 to 6.5.
