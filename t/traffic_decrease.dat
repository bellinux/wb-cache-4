The Municipality of Buenos Aires had stated that there could be no level crossings in the freeway which obligated BAPR to build a bridge over it. The line had been thought for freight services mainly, carrying merchandise to Riachuelo. However the creation of Port of Buenos Aires made cargo <b>traffic</b> <b>decrease</b> in the South of the city. The BAPR decided to close the line, leaving the Villa Real district without services and virtually isolated from public transport. When it was first completed, the new line provided the provinces of the Cuyo with a direct rail link to the federal capital, instead of the much longer route, via Villa María to Rosario and then by river steamer to Buenos Aires.|$|E
5000|$|In 1983 the {{domestic}} traffic operated by Linjeflyg moved from Bromma to Arlanda, using the terminal {{now known as}} Terminal 4. In 1990 two new domestic terminals called [...] "Domestic 2 and 3" [...] were built south of the first domestic terminal. In 1992 the terminal 2 was partly abandoned because of <b>traffic</b> <b>decrease.</b> It started {{to be used for}} international traffic the year after, and the main domestic and international terminals were renumbered into 4 and 5. The third runway was built between 1998 and 2002. However, a recession in 2002 delayed its opening until 2003. At that time protests were raised by people living under its flight path in the municipality of Upplands Väsby. Traffic has recovered since and is now showing healthy increases but the third runway is only used during peak hours for environmental reasons. In September 2010 the first Airbus A380 superjumbo landed at the airport.|$|E

Lane Street between 5th and 6th Avenues South. The Lane Street closure was controversial within the community, especially among some local small-business owners who were concerned that it would increase <b>traffic,</b> <b>decrease</b> emergency vehicle access, and have a negative economic impact on other businesses. The International District saw a protest of over 500 strong, the biggest street protests since the Kingdome was built. Save Lane Street, a group formed to stop the street closure, collected over $140,000 and 4,000 signatures and sued both the city of Seattle and Uwajimaya. The group lost their case, eventually appealing to the King County Superior Court and then the state Court of Appeals. In the end S. Lane Street was vacated to allow Uwajimaya to provide a pedestrian walkway to customer parking to the South.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{reports in}} the popular media suggest a {{significant}} decrease in peer-to-peer (P 2 P) file-sharing traffic, attributed to the public's response to legal threats. Have we {{reached the end of the}} P 2 P revolution? In pursuit of legitimate data to verify this hypothesis, we embark on a more accurate measurement effort of P 2 P traffic at the link level. In contrast to previous efforts we introduce two novel elements in our methodology. First, we measure traffic of all known popular P 2 P protocols. Second, we go beyond the "known port" limitation by reverse engineering the protocols and identifying characteristic strings in the payload. We find that, if measured accurately, P 2 P traffic has never declined; indeed we have never seen the proportion of p 2 p <b>traffic</b> <b>decrease</b> over time (any change is an increase) in any of our data sources...|$|E
50|$|Increase in {{wheel loads}} has {{important}} implications for the rail infrastructure needed to accommodate future grain hopper car shipments.

40|$|One of {{the best}} known cases of {{struggle}} for the commons in Italy, characterized by bitter controversies over the last 20 years, is the popular opposition to the construction of the High Speed Railway line (HSR, "TAV" in Italian) between Turin and Lyon, designed to cross the Susa Valley (at the Italian-French border) and the Alps. This HSR project still carries, in spite of twenty years of continuous updating and reworking, a great deal of environmental and economic issues. An issue of insufficient cost-benefit balance has recently come to clear evidence, especially in view of the non-negligible passenger and freight <b>traffic</b> <b>decrease</b> along the Turin-Lyon direction. The most important aspects dealing with economic costs and claimed benefits, energetic considerations, legal constraints, environmental impact, health impact potential, and the negative experience of other projects, are discussed: they all suggest that the High-Speed Train Turin-Lyon is not a priority for Italy and France, and its construction should be immediately stoppe...|$|E
40|$|Proxy caching is a {{commonly}} accepted methodology {{used to reduce}} Internet <b>traffic,</b> <b>decrease</b> back-end related user delays, and generally improve web performance. Nevertheless, {{it seems to be}} inadequate when it comes to caching dynamic web pages, due to their low degree of reusability and strong dependency on the back-end site infrastructure. In order to overcome these drawbacks we present DOMProxy (Dynamic Objects Manager Proxy), a new Proxy architecture that enables front-end web caching for dynamically generated web pages. Instead of caching web pages produced dynamically or their fragments, the proposed architecture provides methods for ""caching"" their generation process. This is achieved by caching both the applications and the back-end data content that are used to create dynamic web pages. We discuss the new challenges and issues raised by this approach, with special emphasis on the caching and manipulation of different types of web objects at a front-end caching point. © 2005 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|Free-viewpoint {{video is}} {{a new type of}} {{interactive}} multimedia service allowing users to control their viewpoint and generate new views of a dynamic scene from any perspective. The uniquely generated and displayed views are composed from two or more high bitrate camera streams that must be delivered to the users depending on their continuously changing perspective. Due to significant network and computational resource requirements, we proposed scalable viewpoint generation and delivery schemes based on multicast forwarding and distributed approach. Our aim was to find the optimal deployment locations of the distributed viewpoint synthesis processes in the network topology by allowing network nodes to act as proxy servers with caching and viewpoint synthesis functionalities. Moreover, a predictive multicast group management scheme was introduced in order to provide all camera views that may be requested in the near future and prevent the viewpoint synthesizer algorithm from remaining without camera streams. The obtained results showed that even 42 % <b>traffic</b> <b>decrease</b> can be realized using distributed viewpoint synthesis and the probability of viewpoint synthesis starvation can be also significantly reduced in future free viewpoint video services...|$|E

40|$|New type {{of video}} {{streaming}} may {{appear in the}} future networks, called Free-viewpoint Television (FTV) allowing customers to control their viewpoint and generate new views of a dynamic scene from any 3 D position. The desired viewpoint is synthetized from two or more camera views requiring significant network and computational resources. We propose to distribute the viewpoint synthesis functionality in the network in so called proxy servers. In this paper we investigated how to localize the proxy servers in order to generate the lowest traffic load, but avoid the overload of the disposable resources. Finding the optimal layout is a NP-complete problem, so {{our goal was to}} analyze the achievable gain in a simple hierarchical network with several nodes, where the runtime of the brute force optimization algorithm is still acceptable. The obtained results paper showed that even 42 % <b>traffic</b> <b>decrease</b> can be realized using distributed viewpoint synthesis for FTV services, so it is worth to continue our work and investigate new alternative optimization algorithms that are capable to find near optimal proxy server layouts and fast enough to adapt the proxy server arrangement continuously according to actual user requirements...|$|E
40|$|Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) {{systems have}} brought two serious {{problems}} for Internet Services Providers (ISPs) : traffic surges and network congestion. Proxy caching for P 2 P traffic {{is an effective}} means of easing the burden imposed by P 2 P traffic on ISPs. The deployment strategy of proxy caches has a significant impact on their effect on ISPs. It has two important components: one is cache operation that is what P 2 P traffic caches monitor and serve; the other is cache deployment algorithm that is where to deploy caches. In this paper, we propose a deployment strategy of proxy caches, called LHCDS (Cache Deployment Strategy for Lower and Higher networks), including a new type of cache operation and its corresponding deployment algorithm. It can serve P 2 P traffic not only from the local lower access network to the higher transit ISP's network but also within the higher transit ISP's network itself. In LHCDS, caches are deployed at or near core routers of the transit ISP. We develop several deployment algorithms based on the new cache operation. We then evaluate the algorithms, and conclude that the proposed greedy algorithm is a viable and practical algorithm whose performance is close to optimal. Experiments also show that ISPs can achieve more P 2 P <b>traffic</b> <b>decrease</b> on links using LHCDS than previous strategies. 7 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The Internet {{is one of}} the {{important}} infrastructures in our daily life, and its highly distributed and autonomous natures have been said to be robust against failures. This paper reports an impact of an unexpectedly large earthquake (M 9. 0) hit to the northern part of Japan at 14 : 46 : 18 on 11 th March (UTC+ 9), 2011 (the East Japan Earthquake) [2] on a nationwide research and education network (SINET 4 [10, 12, 13]) in Japan. We show that the network managed to run even after the earthquake thanks to two different levels of redundancies, though some physical links were damaged; consequently, the impact on the routing (both BGP and OSPF) was insignificant. At the epicenter area, some network nodes (i. e., universities) were disconnected from the network by the blackout upto 70 hours. In the view of long-term traffic trend, it took 5 - 6 weeks for recovery of the traffic volume there. On the other hand, in the backbone network, the rapid decrease (40 - 50 %) in the traffic volume only lasted for a few hours due to the blackout near the epicenter, and the impact of the <b>traffic</b> <b>decrease</b> in the epicenter area on the backbone traffic is estimated to 15 - 25 %.

40|$|Caching is {{fundamental}} to performance in distributed information retrieval systems such as the World Wide Web. This thesis introduces novel techniques for optimizing performance and cost-effectiveness in Web cache hierarchies. When requests are served by nearby caches rather than distant servers, server loads and network <b>traffic</b> <b>decrease</b> and transactions are faster. Cache system design and management, however, face extraordinary challenges in loosely-organized environments like the Web, where the many components involved in content creation, transport, and consumption are owned and administered by different entities. Such environments call for decentralized algorithms in which stakeholders act on local information and private preferences. In this thesis I consider problems of optimally designing new Web cache hierarchies and optimizing existing ones. The methods I introduce span the Web from point of content creation to point of consumption: I quantify the impact of content-naming practices on cache performance; present techniques for variable-quality-of-service cache management; describe how a decentralized algorithm can compute economically-optimal cache sizes in a branching two-level cache hierarchy; and introduce a new protocol extension that eliminates redundant data transfers and allows “dynamic” content to be cached consistently. To evaluate several of my new methods, I conducted trace-driven simulations on an unprecedented scale. This in turn required novel workload measurement methods and efficient new characterization and simulation techniques. The performance benefits of my proposed protocol extension are evaluated using two extraordinarily large and detailed workload traces collected in a traditional corporate network environment and an unconventional thin-client system. My empirical research follows a simple but powerful paradigm: measure {{on a large scale}} an important production environment’s exogenous workload; identify performance bounds inherent in the workload, independent of the system currently serving it; identify gaps between actual and potential performance in the environment under study; and finally devise ways to close these gaps through component modifications or through improved inter-component integration. This approach may be applicable {{to a wide range of}} Web services as they mature...|$|E
