You are to understand, first, that it is the request of the person from whom I take my {{instructions}} that you always bear the name of Pip.

6000|$|... "I {{should think}} not! Now {{you are to}} understand, secondly, Mr. Pip, that {{the name of the}} person who is your liberal benefactor remains a {{profound}} secret, until the person chooses to reveal it. I am empowered to mention that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by word of mouth to yourself. When or where that intention may be carried out, I cannot say; no one can say. It may be years hence. Now, you are distinctly to understand that you are most positively prohibited from making any inquiry on this head, or any allusion or reference, however distant, to any individual whomsoever as the individual, in all the communications you may have with me. If you have a suspicion in your own breast, keep that suspicion in your own breast. It is not the least to the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition are; they may be the strongest and gravest reasons, or they may be mere whim. This is not for you to inquire into. The condition is laid down. Your acceptance of it, and your observance of it as binding, is the only remaining condition that I am charged with, by the person from whom I take my instructions, and for whom I am not otherwise responsible. That person is the person from whom you derive your expectations, and the secret is solely held by that person and by me. Again, not a very difficult condition with which to encumber such a rise in fortune; but if you have any objection to it, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> mention it. Speak out." ...|$|E
