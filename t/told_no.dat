5|$|Shortly after Darren {{returns to}} Hollyoaks village from America three years later, Darren begins a {{skimming}} scam which {{is found out}} by his boss Scott who refuses to give him time off work. In retaliation he plants incriminating evidence on Scott's computer before calling the police. Scott sets fire to The Loft with Darren inside, but Scott becomes trapped and Darren leaves him for dead. Darren is <b>told</b> <b>no</b> trace of Scott has been found, but Scott is alive and sends threatening postcards to Darren. Scott attacks Darren, who pleads with Scott not to kill him, but the police arrive shortly after.|$|E
25|$|Mark's account (which in the {{earliest}} extant manuscripts) ends abruptly and claims that the women <b>told</b> <b>no</b> one. The Gospels of Matthew and Mark do not present any further involvement at the tomb. Luke describes Peter as running to the tomb to check for himself, and John adds that the Beloved Disciple did so too, the beloved disciple outrunning Peter.|$|E
25|$|After the Anschluss, {{his brother}} Paul left almost {{immediately}} for England, {{and later the}} US. The Nazis discovered his relationship with Hilde Schania, a brewer's daughter {{with whom he had}} had two children but whom he had never married, though he did later. Because she was not Jewish, he was served with a summons for Rassenschande (racial defilement). He <b>told</b> <b>no</b> one he was leaving the country, except for Hilde who agreed to follow him. He left so suddenly and quietly that for a time people believed he was the fourth Wittgenstein brother to have committed suicide.|$|E

25|$|There {{was some}} {{controversy}} over the takeover, with it being revealed that a senior accountant with the Gas and Fuel Corporation had bought 11,000 shares in the Geelong Gas Company shortly before the takeover was made public. It was proved that the accountant had used insider knowledge to buy the shares, but the State Government was <b>told</b> <b>no</b> action could be taken. The issue remained alive until late 1971 when then Opposition Leader Mr Clyde Holding called for a further investigation. This move was quashed by then Premier Sir Henry Bolte {{on the advice of}} the Victorian Auditor General.|$|E
25|$|Also on November 26, Crow Neck, a {{returning}} warrior, told Bad Man (also {{known as}} Cranky Man) {{that he had}} left an exhausted horse along the trail to rest. When {{he went back to}} retrieve the horse that day, he saw moving figures to the north who looked like soldiers. Fearful, he turned back without getting his horse. Bad Man doubted Crow Neck had seen soldiers; he said perhaps he had a guilty conscience from having gone against the chiefs' wishes by joining the war party. Crow Neck <b>told</b> <b>no</b> one else what he had seen, fearing that he might be laughed at, or chastised by Black Kettle for having been part of the raid.|$|E
25|$|Giorgione also {{introduced}} a new range of subjects. Besides altarpieces and portraits he painted pictures that <b>told</b> <b>no</b> story, whether biblical or classical, or if they professed to tell a story, neglected the action and simply embodied in form and color moods of lyrical or romantic feeling, much as a musician might embody them in sounds. Innovating with the courage and felicity of genius, he had for a time an overwhelming influence on his contemporaries and immediate successors in the Venetian school, including Titian, Sebastiano del Piombo, Palma il Vecchio, il Cariani, Giulio Campagnola (and his brother), and even on his already eminent master, Giovanni Bellini. In the Venetian mainland, Giorgionismo strongly influenced Morto da Feltre, Domenico Capriolo, and Domenico Mancini.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1887, Addams read in a {{magazine}} about the new idea of starting a settlement house. She decided to visit the world's first, Toynbee Hall, in London. She and several friends, including Ellen Gates Starr, traveled in Europe from December 1887 through {{the summer of}} 1888. After watching a bullfight in Madrid, fascinated by what she saw as an exotic tradition, Addams condemned this fascination and her inability to feel outraged at {{the suffering of the}} horses and bulls. At first, Addams <b>told</b> <b>no</b> one about her dream to start a settlement house; but, she felt increasingly guilty for not acting on her dream. Believing that sharing her dream might help her to act on it, she told Ellen Gates Starr. Starr loved the idea and agreed to join Addams in starting a settlement house.|$|E
25|$|Some drivers {{elected to}} make pit stops {{for the change}} to the soft {{compound}} tyres; Ferrari brought both their drivers in {{to enable them to}} reach the end of the race without making another pit stop. Hamilton's race engineer Peter Bonnington warned him about the debris but Hamilton did not receive the warning fast enough and drove over shards of wing. He asked his team about tyre pressures and was <b>told</b> <b>no</b> issues had been discovered. Sutil was issued with a five-second stop-and-go penalty for the collision with Pérez. The safety car was withdrawn {{at the end of the}} 37th lap and racing resumed with Hamilton leading the field back up to speed. Hamilton set the fastest lap of the race at one minute and 50.417 seconds on lap 39 to pull out a 5.8 second advantage over Vettel. Sutil's car developed a water leak and retired two laps later to prevent the risk of his engine failing. Button drew closer to Bottas while Hülkenberg moved ahead of Kvyat for 11th position. Pérez took advantage of a battle between Ericsson and Kvyat and overtook both drivers for 14th on lap 49.|$|E
500|$|Grant {{took part}} in [...] "Reporters Remember 11-22-63" [...] at Southern Methodist University in Dallas in November 1993. The panel discussion, {{broadcast}} on C-SPAN as Journalists Remember the JFK Assassination, featured {{members of the press}} who spoke of their experiences on the day 30 years earlier that Kennedy was killed. From the dais, Grant offered his memories of the motorcade, and recalled asking his boss afterward if he should go back to Washington, D.C., with Kennedy's body and being <b>told</b> <b>no.</b> Grant said he returned to Love Field to retrieve his luggage ahead of a planned visit to Vice President Johnson's ranch nearby; just as he reached the planes he saw Judge Sarah T.

500|$|Galland {{took part}} in many engagements {{throughout}} the 1960s and 1970s. In 1974, {{he was part of}} the remaining German General Staff that {{took part in}} the Operation Sea Lion wargame at Sandhurst in the United Kingdom, replicating the planned German invasion of Britain in 1940 (which the German side lost). In 1975, he was a guest at the RAF Museum Hendon, during the unveiling of the Battle of Britain Hall, where he was entertained by Prince Charles. In 1980, Galland's eyesight became too poor for him to fly and he retired as a pilot. However, he continued to attend numerous aviation events, to include being a periodic guest of the U.S. Air Force for their annual [...] "Gathering of Eagles" [...] program at the Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, USA. On 16 October, he was reunited with two Merkel shotguns stolen by American soldiers after his capture in 1945. Galland had located them before and had tried to buy them back, only to be <b>told</b> <b>no,</b> as they would be worth more after his death. Towards the end of the 1980s, Galland's health began to fail.|$|E

[...] Kennedy then requested the keys to his mother's car from his chauffeur, Crimmins. Asked why he did not have his chauffeur drive them both, Kennedy explained that Crimmins and some other guests [...] "were concluding their meal, enjoying the fellowship and it didn't appear to me necessary to require him to bring me back to Edgartown."

2500|$|For {{the band}}'s three New York performances, {{the band members}} wore exactly the same clothes to {{facilitate}} seamless editing of the film, except for John Paul Jones and Jimmy Page who wore different sets of attire {{on some of the}} nights, which created continuity problems. Page is seen wearing a different dragon suit in [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] and the [...] "Celebration Day" [...] remaster. In an interview from 1997 Jones said that the reason he didn't wear the same stage clothes was that he asked the crew if they would be filming on those nights and was <b>told</b> <b>no.</b> [...] "I'd think 'not to worry, I'll save the shirt I wore the previous night for the next filming'.

2500|$|It {{was here}} that the third Selma to Montgomery march ended on March 25, 1965, with 25,000 protesters {{at the foot of}} the capitol steps on Dexter Avenue.

2500|$|On an {{isolated}} island, Mary lives {{with a man}} who is known to the other islanders as a holy man. This man works at his scriptures desperate for a vision to enable him to complete them. Two men arrive on the island as they have heard that the Queen of Heaven lives there. Sent by the islanders to the croft where Mary and the man live, they are <b>told</b> <b>no</b> such person lives on the island and they should stop their search for false gods. The two men leave. Soon after, another boat arrives on the island with Jesus in the company of Simon and Andrew. Jesus takes Mary away with him, walking on water to reach the boat. John remains on the island and is reinspired to complete his work..."It was the Lord's Day, and at once he knew that this was to be the great day of his life!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Although the ALF members reject {{violence}} against people, many activists support attacks on property, comparing {{the destruction of}} animal laboratories and other facilities to resistance fighters blowing up gas chambers in Nazi Germany. Their argument for sabotage is that the removal of animals from a laboratory simply means they will be quickly replaced, but if the laboratory itself is destroyed, it not only slows down the restocking process, but increases costs, possibly {{to the point of}} making animal research prohibitively expensive; this, they argue, will encourage the search for alternatives. An ALF activist involved in an arson attack on the University of Arizona <b>told</b> <b>No</b> Compromise in 1996: [...] "t is much the same thing as the abolitionists who fought against slavery going in and burning down the quarters or tearing down the auction block ... Sometimes when you just take animals and do nothing else, perhaps that is not as strong a message." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early December 2003, Passion of the Christ co-producer Stephen McEveety {{provided}} {{the film to}} Archbishop Stanisław Dziwisz, the pope's secretary. Archbishop Dziwisz returned the film to McEveety {{and said he had}} watched it with John Paul II. On December 16, Daily Variety reported that the pope had seen the film, and on December 17, The Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan reported that John Paul II had said: [...] "It is as it was," [...] sourcing McEveety, who said he heard it from Dziwisz. National Catholic Reporter journalist John Allen published a similar account on the same day, quoting an unnamed senior Vatican official. The following day, Reuters and the Associated Press each independently confirmed the story, citing Vatican sources. On December 24, an anonymous Vatican official told Catholic News Service, [...] "There was no declaration, no judgment from the pope." [...] On January 9, John Allen defended his earlier reporting, saying that his official source was adamant about the veracity of the original story. In a January 18 column, Frank Rich interviewed the Italian translator who quoted Dziwisz as saying that the pope called the film [...] "incredible" [...] and said [...] "it is as it was." [...] Rich attacked the marketing of the film and suggested Dziwisz wielded too much influence over the pope. The next day Archbishop Dziwisz told CNS, [...] "The Holy Father <b>told</b> <b>no</b> one his opinion of this film." [...] This denial resulted in a round of commentators who accused the film producers of fabricating a papal quote to market their movie.|$|E
