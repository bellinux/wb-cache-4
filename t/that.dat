5|$|A 2009 {{study showed}} <b>that</b> {{holes in the}} skulls of several {{specimens}} <b>that</b> were previously explained by intraspecific attacks might {{have been caused by}} Trichomonas-like parasites <b>that</b> commonly infect avians. Further evidence of intraspecific attack were found by Joseph Peterson and his colleagues in the juvenile Tyrannosaurus nicknamed Jane. Peterson and his team found <b>that</b> Jane's skull showed healed puncture wounds on the upper jaw and snout which they believe came from another juvenile Tyrannosaurus. Subsequent CT scans of Jane's skull would further confirm the team's hypothesis, showing <b>that</b> the puncture wounds came from a traumatic injury and <b>that</b> there was subsequent healing. The team would also state <b>that</b> Jane's injuries were structurally different from the parasite-induced lesions found in Sue and <b>that</b> Jane's injuries were on her face whereas the parasite <b>that</b> infected Sue caused lesions to the lower jaw.|$|E
5|$|A related {{objection}} is <b>that</b> {{evolution is}} based on unreliable evidence, claiming <b>that</b> evolution is not even well-evidenced. Typically, this is either based on the argument <b>that</b> evolution's evidence is full of frauds and hoaxes, <b>that</b> current evidence for evolution {{is likely to be}} overturned as some past evidence has been, or <b>that</b> certain types of evidence are inconsistent and dubious.|$|E
5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or a test <b>that</b> could be made <b>that</b> would demonstrate <b>that</b> the {{statement is}} false. Statements <b>that</b> are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests <b>that</b> evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed <b>that</b> any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to demonstrate <b>that</b> evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E

5|$|A year later, Mechnikov {{studied a}} fresh water {{crustacean}} called Daphnia, a tiny transparent animal <b>that</b> can be examined directly under a microscope.

He went on to extend his observations to the white blood cells of mammals and discovered <b>that</b> the bacterium Bacillus anthracis could be engulfed and killed by phagocytes, a process <b>that</b> he called phagocytosis. Mechnikov proposed <b>that</b> phagocytes were a primary defense against invading organisms.|$|E

5|$|Any {{married person}} who alleges <b>that</b> {{reasonable}} grounds exist for supposing <b>that</b> {{the other party}} to the marriage is dead may apply to court to have it presumed <b>that</b> the other party is dead {{and to have the}} marriage dissolved. If the court is satisfied <b>that</b> such reasonable grounds exist, it may make an interim judgment of presumption of death and of divorce. In such proceedings, the fact <b>that</b> for seven years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has no reason to believe <b>that</b> the other party has been living within <b>that</b> time, is evidence <b>that</b> the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|E
5|$|As Rosenbaum {{describes}} it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming {{girl with}} a little naïveté. It is this naïveté <b>that</b> allows Lex to believe <b>that</b> he can trust and confide in Lana, and <b>that</b> she is his one true love. Lex also knows <b>that</b> Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who he is just the same. Rosenbaum does not believe <b>that</b> Lana gives <b>that</b> to Lex. Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and <b>that</b> of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe <b>that</b> these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends <b>that</b> Lex is not using Lana {{in an effort to}} hurt Clark, but <b>that</b> he really does love her. The actor believes <b>that</b> Lex's problem lies in the fact <b>that</b> every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been hurt, or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past. Rosenbaum believes <b>that</b> the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is a moment <b>that</b> solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.|$|E

5|$|As for the BIA's assurance, the Court <b>that</b> {{only meant}} <b>that</b> the {{termination}} act did not terminate the claim, not <b>that</b> {{the statute of}} limitations would not begin to run.

5|$|Because of the {{possible}} single-egg clutch and the bird's large size, it has been proposed <b>that</b> the dodo was K-selected, meaning <b>that</b> it produced a low number of altricial offspring, which required parental care until they matured. Some evidence, including the large size and the fact <b>that</b> tropical and frugivorous birds have slower growth rates, indicates <b>that</b> the bird {{may have had a}} protracted development period. The fact <b>that</b> no juvenile dodos have been found in the Mare aux Songes swamp may indicate <b>that</b> they produced little offspring, <b>that</b> they matured rapidly, <b>that</b> the breeding grounds were far away from the swamp, or <b>that</b> the risk of miring was seasonal.|$|E

5|$|Colonel Harvey's {{account of}} the smoke-filled room had Harding being sent for {{in the early morning}} hours, to be {{informed}} by Harvey <b>that</b> the Ohioan would be the candidate. Harvey stated he asked if there was anything in Harding's background <b>that</b> might harm his candidacy, to which the senator, who had had at least one extramarital affair, replied there was not. Harding biographer Charles W. Murray noted <b>that</b> there is no evidence besides Harvey's word <b>that</b> Harding went to the Hays suite <b>that</b> night, and <b>that</b> other participants denied <b>that</b> Harding was there.

5|$|Ethicist Tom Regan {{rejected}} Kant's {{assessment of}} the moral worth of animals on three main points: First, he rejected Kant's claim <b>that</b> animals are not self-conscious. He then challenged Kant's claim <b>that</b> animals have no intrinsic moral worth because they cannot make a moral judgment. Regan argued <b>that,</b> if a being's moral worth is determined by its ability to make a moral judgment, then we must regard humans who are incapable of moral thought as being equally undue moral consideration. Regan finally argued <b>that</b> Kant's assertion <b>that</b> animals exist merely {{as a means to}} an end is unsupported; the fact <b>that</b> animals have a life <b>that</b> can go well or badly suggests <b>that,</b> like humans, they have their own ends.|$|E

5|$|Even though Lana {{eventually}} marries Lex {{in season}} six, Al Gough argues <b>that</b> Lana still loved Clark and Clark still loved her. The only reason Lana was with Lex was because Clark forced her in <b>that</b> direction and {{she ended up}} getting in over her head. By contrast, writer Caroline Dries feels <b>that</b> Lana did love Lex, and <b>that</b> she did not make any hasty decisions when she agreed to marry him. Dries believes <b>that</b> the progression of the show demonstrates <b>that</b> Lex earned Lana's love. To answer viewers <b>that</b> hated to see Lana marry Lex, Dries contends <b>that</b> as viewers we are seeing all of Lex, including how evil he truly is, while Lana only sees the portion of Lex <b>that</b> appears good.|$|E

Sextus Empiricus argued <b>that</b> it was absurd to link human {{attributes}} with myths about the signs of the zodiac. Carneades argued <b>that</b> belief in fate denies free will and morality; <b>that</b> people born at different times can all die in the same accident or battle; and <b>that</b> contrary to uniform influences from the stars, tribes and cultures are all different.|$|E
