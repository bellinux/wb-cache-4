500|$|Atkinson {{has said}} that in the buildup to the final episode, he began to psychologically {{experience}} something of his character's apprehension. Speaking to Michael Parkinson in 2003, he recalled [...] "I remember...in {{the weeks leading up to}} the one day recording of that final episode when we went over the top, for the first time in my acting career...knowing that even though the rest of the episode was its usual standard funny sitcom self, there was this deep twist in my stomach throughout that week thinking along with your character that you were doomed. It was most peculiar. I'm sure serious character actors feel <b>this</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time...</b> Obviously if you're trying to feel the character and his dilemma then you're going to experience some of the fictional feelings for real. You felt swept along by it." ...|$|E
500|$|Conway {{continued}} McConnell's line {{of attack}} on Bevin's finances, specifically the issue of delinquent taxes. While McConnell's charges involved delinquent taxes against Bevin Brothers Manufacturing, Theo Keith of Louisville's WAVE reported in June that Bevin had been late at least 10 times paying property taxes on his vacation homes in Maine and Louisiana between 2002 and 2009. He further reported in July that Bevin's company, Integrity Holdings, also had multiple past delinquency issues. In total, Keith estimated that Bevin had paid about $1,800 in penalties for late tax payments. Bevin became irritated with Keith's reporting and refused to answer questions from him at subsequent press conferences; he did not buy ads on WAVE, despite running ads on Louisville's other three network broadcast stations. The Associated Press' Adam Beam eventually reported that Bevin had paid his taxes late on 30 different occasions. In an October interview with Beam, Bevin said, [...] "Sometimes you do pay it late and you pay interest on having paid it late. But you pay the taxes. ... You do <b>this</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> in business." [...] He added that his critics [...] "could have done just as breathless a story of all the times I paid my taxes early and gotten a discount on it." [...] He also reiterated that, as {{of the time of}} the interview, he had paid all of his taxes: [...] "Do I actually owe taxes to anyone, anywhere? The answer is no." ...|$|E
2500|$|A patch was {{released}} September 9, 2010 to fix {{issues in the}} game. [...] Players can no longer use collision glitches with the world geometry {{to find ways to}} cheat on the game's leaderboards.

The patch also decreases the amount of time to wait on players who do not finish multiplayer races. [...] Vector Unit later removed glitched times from the game's leaderboards in November 2010. When asked {{about the possibility of a}} PlayStation 3 port of the game, the company stated [...] "People ask us <b>this</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and unfortunately the answer is no.

500|$|The {{graphics}} {{were seen}} {{as one of the}} strongest aspects of the game. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot wrote: [...] "graphically, Banjo-Kazooie takes it to another level. The game maintains {{the look and feel of}} Mario 64, but instead of flat, shaded polygons, [...] uses a lot of textures". The game's long draw distance, solid frame rate, special lighting, transparency effects, and animations were also highlighted very positively. Critics also praised the game's dynamic soundtrack. Schneider remarked that it [...] "lets players know where they are going. <b>This</b> happens <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and in every level. It's all very Disney-esque." [...] The sound effects received similar praise, with several editors crediting the unique and diverse speech patterns of the characters.|$|R

Also if David wearies of you he scruples not to say so, but Porthos, in like circumstances, offers you his paw, meaning 'Farewell,' and to bearded men he does <b>this</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> (I think because of a hereditary distaste for goats), so that they conceive him to be enamoured of them when he is only begging them courteously to go.

60|$|I dressed at George's; then, {{like one}} of those bewildering shifts of a cinematograph, comes the scene in church, the glimpse of my mother's wistful face in the front pew; and I found myself in front of the austere Mr. Doddridge {{standing}} beside Maude--or rather beside a woman I tried hard to believe was Maude--so veiled and generally encased was she. I was thinking of <b>this</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> I was mechanically answering Mr. Doddridge, and even when the wedding march burst forth and I led her out of the church. It was as though they had done their best to disguise her, to put our union on the other-worldly plane that was deemed to be its only justification, to neutralize her sex at the very moment it should have been most enhanced. Well, they succeeded. If I had not been as conventional as the rest, I should have preferred to have run away with her in the lavender dress she wore when I first proposed to her. It was only when we had got into the carriage and started for the house and she turned to me her face from which the veil had been thrown back that I realized what a sublime meaning it all had for her. Her eyes were wet. Once more I was acutely conscious of my inability to feel deeply at supreme moments. For months I had looked forward with anticipation and impatience to my wedding-day.|$|E

Unfortunately, many companies are forced to use an all-encompassing lifting limit that is safe for all people in all situations. Since a general lifting limit {{does not take into account}} any of the relative specific variables it will almost certainly be overly restrictive for any specific application. At InfoPrint the corporate lifting limits were unnecessarily restrictive for the specific task of lifting network printers which created inefficiencies in the development process. Therefore, a set of more specific corporate lifting guidelines for printers were developed for workgroup laser printers which streamlined the printer development and approval process...|$|R

40|$|The ever {{growing demand}} for photorealism sets high {{expectations}} for the graphics hardware and to the APIs exploiting these features. In the last few years, the graphics hardware has evolved to the level where other reflection models than the traditional Phong model can {{be considered to be}} used in real-time. This thesis reviews the reflection and illumination models currently used in real-time graphics and discusses the future possibilities according to recent academic publications. Also, the currently supported features in hardware and in the APIs, and the possibilities they provide, are discussed. The implementation part will provide an implementation of five different reflection models and their visual inspection along with the associated degrade in performance. The results indicate that modern graphics accelerators actually make it possible to move to more complex reflection models. Also, the constantly evolving GPUs create new possibilities for the application developers in <b>this</b> field <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time...</b>|$|R
