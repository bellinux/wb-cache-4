5|$|This was {{followed}} on April 4, 1968, by Apollo 6 (AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{mission was to}} achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the Service Module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced pogo oscillation, a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines {{in the second and}} third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the Service Module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo 6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn V ready to fly men, cancelling a third unmanned test.|$|E

25|$|As {{ships of}} wooden {{construction}} {{gave way to}} iron and steel, the cruiser stern—another design without transoms and known variously as the canoe stern, parabolic stern, and the double-ended stern—became the next prominent development in ship stern design, particularly in warships of {{the latter half of}} the 20th century. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> re-design was to protect the steering gear by bringing it below the armor deck. The stern now came to a point rather than a flat panel or a gentle curve, and the counter reached from the sternpost all the way to the taffrail in a continuous arch. It was soon discovered that vessels with cruiser sterns experienced less water resistance when under way than those with elliptical sterns, and between World War I and World War II most merchant ship designs soon followed suit.|$|E
25|$|The {{elevated}} {{section is}} supported by steel-reinforced concrete columns. The roadway itself was constructed on top of concrete slabs supported by steel girders. The height of the elevated section is higher than required to cross city streets and provide clearance underneath. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> was to reduce traffic noise at ground level. The highest point of the elevated section is the eastbound ramp from the Gardiner to the Don Valley Parkway which goes {{up and over the}} westbound lanes, then drops to ground level. The elevated sections of the Gardiner use a tall wall concrete barrier topped with green metal blades. The blades act to reduce the glare of oncoming headlights from the opposing direction of traffic. During the original construction concrete parapet walls with metal railings were used in the outer sections as well as a divider between west bound and east bound traffic. At grade sections west of Bathurst Street use steel guard rails, but originally featured a narrow grass median.|$|E
25|$|All {{ambulances}} are to {{be equipped}} with highly reflective green and yellow 'checkerboard' markings (the English term is 'Battenburg' pattern), of specified proportions, running {{the entire length of}} the vehicle. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> measure was to provide specific 'visual identities' for emergency vehicles, by reserving this pattern for ambulances, blue and yellow Battenburg for police cars, and red and yellow Battenburg for fire service vehicles. In addition, all lettering on the vehicle is required to be highly reflective, in order to boost vehicle visibility in all conditions. The colour combination selected was chosen for specific reasons. Under night time conditions, green is among the most visible (exceeded only by blue) of colours, creating high visibility (and safety) for ambulance vehicles. Unfortunately, for many of those who suffer from colour-blindness, neither green nor red is visible, washing out to shades of grey or dark yellow. In fact, almost 99 percent of all colour vision deficiency involves some form of red-green colour blindness, and includes an estimated 7-10 percent of all males, depending on location. However, even for these individuals, the colour yellow is always visible (see diagram). The resulting pattern is both high visibility and eye-catching for the average person, provides improved night time visibility for most, and provides a combination which is identifiable, at least in part, by the majority of the population.|$|E

2500|$|The Treasury Note (also {{known as}} a Coin Note) was a type of {{representative}} money issued by the United States government from 1890 until 1893 under authority of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in denominations of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100 and $1000.

[...] A $500 note was designed but never issued. A distinguishing feature of the Series 1890 notes (and one that greatly appeals to collectors) is the extremely ornate designs on the reverse side of the notes. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> was to make counterfeiting much more difficult, but opponents of the design argued that the extensive detail would {{make it more difficult}} to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit notes.
