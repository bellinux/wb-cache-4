In the second part, Chitosan was added to emulsion and viscosity, storage stability and break time were tested. Results of first part indicated that Chitosan replacement was only possible up to 10 % replacement for cationic slow setting type of emulsions but rheological properties of rapid setting emulsions could be improved by replacing up to 60 % of amine emulsifier with Chitosan. A significant increase in viscosity from 16 SSU (with 0 % Chitosan) to 43 SSU (with 60 % Chitosan) was observed for rapid setting emulsions. Storage Stability showed the optimum value of zero at 40 % replacement and all the values up to 60 % replacement were found to be within the ASTM specified level of ± 1 %. Break time measurements suggested that for slow setting type emulsions Chitosan use as an emulsifier has increased the emulsion breaking rate. Further high viscous and stable rapid setting emulsion could be obtained without hindering the compliance to ASTM standard by replacing the amine emulsifier with Chitosan. Results of second part suggested that Chitosan acts as a viscosity modifier and increases the emulsion viscosity from 26 SSU to 92 SSU when added at 0. 2 % of emulsion weight.

30|$|The {{following}} {{is one example}} to illustrate the synthesis process for nanocomposite gels. First, 30  g of AM was dissolved in 100  g of distilled water in a double-necked flat-bottomed reactor equipped with inlet and outlet tubes for nitrogen gas. The mixture was stirred {{at room temperature for}} 10  min. Then, 0.2  % (0.26  g) of Calcium Montmorillonite was added to the solution and stirred vigorously for about 24  h to ensure complete exfoliation of clay nanomaterial. Then, 250  ppm of the labile crosslinker PEG- 200 was added to the mixture and stirred for 10  min. The mixed solution was then purged with nitrogen gas for 30  min before 100  ppm of KPS initiator was added to the solution. This resulting solution was kept for 10  h at 40  °C in a water bath to ensure complete gelation. The strong and elastic bulk gel formed was cut into small pieces. It was then purified by soaking in a large amount of distilled water for 3  days to remove the unreacted monomers and additives, followed by drying in an oven at 60  °C until the weight could not change any more. The dried gel solids were crushed into very small particle sizes, called preformed particle gels (PPGs), by blending in a blender machine (Black & Decker). PPGs with the particle size between 80 and 100 mesh (180 – 250  µm) were selected through the standard <b>testing</b> <b>sieves</b> (Fisher Scientific Company) for further characterization and evaluation. For gels with no nanomaterial, the same procedure was followed except that nanoclay was excluded.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the application of}} an imprinted mercury(lI) polymer that we synthesized by copolymerizing the functional and cross-linking monomers, N'-[3 -(Trimethoxysilyl) propyl] diethylenetriamine (TPET) and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) {{in the presence of}} mercury (II) ions as template. A bulk polymerization method following a double-imprinting procedure and employing hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), as a second template to improve the efficiency of the polymer was employed in the synthesis. The imprinted polymer particles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and their average size determined by screen analysis using standard <b>test</b> <b>sieves.</b> The relative selective coefficients (k') of the imprinted polymer evaluated from selective binding studies between Hg ²⁺and Cu²⁺ or Hg²⁺ and Cd²⁺, were 10588 and 3147, respectively. These values indicated highly favored Hg²⁺ extractions over the two competing ions. Application of the polymer to various real water samples (tap, sea, river, pulverized coal solution, treated and untreated sewerage from the vicinity of Grahamstown in South Africa) showed high extraction efficiencies (EEs) of Hg²⁺ ions; (over 84 % in all cases) as evaluated from the detected unextracted Hg²⁺ ions by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The limit of detection (LOD, 3 ơ) of the method was evaluated to be 0. 036 ng ml⁻¹ and generally the data (n= 10) had percentage relative standard deviation (%RSD) of less than 4 %. These findings indicate that the double-imprinted polymer has potential to be used as an efficient extraction material for the selective pre-concentration of mercury(lI) ions in aqueous environments.
