5|$|Under Protocol 3, Jersey {{is part of}} the European Union Customs Union of the European Community. The common customs tariff, levies {{and other}} {{agricultural}} import measures apply to trade between the island and non-Member States. There is free movement of goods and trade between the island and Member States. EU rules on freedom of movement for workers do not apply in Jersey. However, Article 4 of the Protocol requires the island's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities. In Pereira, the ECJ held that <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> included any matter governed by the Treaties in a territory where the Treaties are fully applicable. The island is therefore within the scope of the Treaties to a limited extent, as a European Territory. To infer, as the French Ambassador and finance minister have attempted to argue, namely that the island is outside the European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic, in law false. The French blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out. As a result, Jersey {{is not part of the}} single market in financial services. It is not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as movement of capital, company law or money laundering. However, the island's close proximity (135km south) and its close association with the financial sector of the U.K. has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with several mainline publications (e.g., The Wall Street Journal) labelling the island a tax haven.|$|E

This information is, by and large, not contended.

Since this body of literature deals with mixtures containing synephrine as only one of several biologically-active components, even, in some cases, without explicit confirmation of the presence of synephrine, further discussion is outside <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>article.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Yugoslav Partisans formed {{operational}} detachments (...) in Bosnia and Herzegovina {{after the}} German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia during World War II.

The detachments were named after a district, town, region or geographic feature, and ranged in size from 16 to 3,000 fighters.

Some detachments had a very brief existence, whereas others existed for most of the war and a few were disestablished and re-established several times.
