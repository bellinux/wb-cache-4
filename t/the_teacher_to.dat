25|$|The second {{purpose of}} the 8LMQs is to {{transition}} ‘teaching’ from ‘teacher centred activities’ to a more responsive ‘student-centred learning' approaches.

40|$|There {{are four}} {{objectives}} of this research: (1) {{to describe the}} development of pedagogical competence (2) to describe the development of personality competence; (3) to describe the development of Social Competence and (4 to describe the development of professional competence This research is a descriptive qualitative one. Data of the research were gained through interview, observation, documentation, by involving the vice principal of curriculum, the vice principal of public relation, <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> and <b>the</b> students of the school. The data were analyzed by using an interactive model of analysis. Validity of the data was obtained through extended time of the research, regular observation, triangulation, and interview of key informants. The results of the research show that most of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> at <b>the</b> State Senior High School 2 Kebumen have mastered the pedagogical competence, social competence, and professional competence. The development of teachers’ competence is meant to fulfil three needs. They are 1) a social need to increase the ability of educational system efficiently and socially, 2) needs to find out ways to develop social potential and academic potential, and 3) needs to develop their personalities. How to develop the pedagogy competence and professional competence is <b>to</b> send <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>to</b> join seminars, trainings, In House Trainings, courses and workshops. And how to develop personal competence and social competence of <b>teachers</b> are <b>to</b> ask <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>to</b> join in <b>the</b> students’activities, religion activities, outbonds, fieldtrips, and <b>to</b> ask <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>to</b> help <b>the</b> poor students. There are some problems to develop the competence: 1) <b>the</b> attitude of <b>teachers</b> who do not support, 2) inadequate infrastructures and facilities, and 3) limited time. Efforts {{to cope with the}} problems are <b>to</b> ask <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>to</b> use E-Learning facilities, <b>to</b> ask <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>to</b> join in <b>the</b> students’activities, to involve themselves in the religious activities and to participate in the social activities...|$|R

25|$|Finally, the {{psychology}} of cognitive development is concerned with individual differences {{in the organization of}} cognitive processes and abilities, in their rate of change, and in their mechanisms of change. The principles underlying intra- and inter-individual differences could be educationally useful, because knowing how students differ in regard to the various dimensions of cognitive development, such as processing and representational capacity, self-understanding and self-regulation, and the various domains of understanding, such as mathematical, scientific, or verbal abilities, would enable <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>to</b> cater for the needs of the different students so that no one is left behind.|$|E

This use is closest to the goal and practice of Mrs. Reed, the original 6th grade teacher who had taken training with Dr. William Glasser on Reality Therapy for classroom teachers. The training led her to use the private written conversations to model the pragmatic, problem-solving perspective of Reality Therapy and {{to encourage students to}} think through issues and problems with her guidance. Of her writing with the students, she said, “I cannot think of any better way to learn so much about my students, myself, and my own teaching”.|$|E

25|$|The 8 LMQs {{have two}} key purposes. Firstly, {{they act as}} a ‘professional {{knowledge}} organiser’. This means the 8 LMQs enable <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>to</b> identify and then organise the fundamental consideration, or elements, required for the successful development and execution of learning experiences, units of work or individual lessons. For the student-teacher the 8LMQs act as a ‘knowledge organiser’ whereby essential professional knowledge, learnt {{as part of their}} preparation program, is organised such they have a bank of ‘considerations’ that they can call upon as they engage with each question. By this is meant the teacher education program should be presented so as to inform each LMQ. This has the effect of providing the student-teacher with a ‘ready-reference’ arrangement of knowledge that they can draw upon and unpack when designing and then executing successful learning experiences.|$|E

However, the group's navigator gave evidence that she and Shaw had been happy to continue the expedition.

500|$|Upon {{receiving}} the King's invitation, Leonowens sent her daughter, Avis, {{to school in}} England, to give Avis the social advantage of a prestigious British education, and traveled to Bangkok with her five-year-old son, Louis. King Mongkut had sought a Briton to teach his children and wives after trying local missionaries, who used the opportunity to proselytize. Leonowens initially asked for $150 in Singapore currency per month. Her additional request, to live {{in or near the}} missionary community to ensure she was not deprived of Western company, aroused suspicion in Mongkut, who cautioned in a letter, [...] "we need not have teacher of Christianity as they are abundant here". King Mongkut and Leonowens came to an agreement: $100 per month and a residence near the royal palace. At a time when most transport in Bangkok was by boat, Mongkut did not wish to have to arrange for <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>to</b> get to work every day. Leonowens and Louis temporarily lived as guests of Mongkut's prime minister, and after the first house offered was found to be unsuitable, the family moved into a brick residence (wooden structures decayed quickly in Bangkok's climate) {{within walking distance of the}} palace.|$|E
