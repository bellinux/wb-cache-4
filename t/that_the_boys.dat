5|$|In 1966, Tony {{married the}} family's {{housekeeper}} Joan Gustafson. They had two children, Jennifer and Mario. Madonna resented her father for getting remarried, and began rebelling against him. They {{would have a}} strained relationship for many years afterward. She attended St. Frederick's and St. Andrew's Catholic Elementary Schools, and West Middle School. Madonna was known for her high grade point average, and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior. She would perform cartwheels and handstands in the hallways between classes, dangle by her knees from the monkey bars during recess, and pull up her skirt during class—all so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> could see her underwear.|$|E
5|$|In October 1840, their {{paternal}} grandfather Kamanawa II requested his grandsons {{to visit}} him {{on the night before}} his execution for the murder of his wife Kamokuiki. The next morning the Cookes allowed ʻĪʻī to bring Kaliokalani and his brother Kalākaua to see Kamanawa for the last time. It is not know if their sister was also taken to see him. Later sources, especially in biographies of Kalākaua indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> witnessed the hanging of their grandfather at the gallows. Historian Helena G. Allen noted the indifference the Cookes' had toward the request and the traumatic experience it must have been for the boys.|$|E
5|$|Tom Comstock {{comes home}} {{the next day}} to find his son {{returned}}, alive but shaken. Black deduces that the paint swatch matches paint used on the vehicle that killed Burke's son; he also realizes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> are being kidnapped to force their fathers to confess hidden sins—Comstock's son was returned after he revealed his affair, while Orlando's son was killed because he kept secret a crime involving money. From there, Black sees that Charlie's kidnapping means that Birckenbeuhl is the hit-and-run driver.|$|E
50|$|The three donkeys: Small One's barn mates. They seem jealous <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> {{spends more}} time with Small One than them, but they {{understand}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> represents a forerunner of the Christ {{in the tradition of}} John the Baptist, and they forgive <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> for his favoritism.|$|R
50|$|France Pilon, the {{assistant}} director of the school board, said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy's</b> parents were repeatedly invited to meet with school officials, but declined, reportedly on legal advice. Pilon also said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy's</b> parents have instructed him to eat apart from other students.|$|R
25|$|Nicholson, {{pursuing}} Teddy to {{the indoor}} swimming pool, hears, {{but does not}} see, <b>the</b> event <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> prophesized, providing <b>the</b> reader with tantalizing evidence <b>that</b> leaves <b>the</b> <b>boy's</b> ultimate fate a mystery.|$|R
5|$|Yubaba {{has many}} {{similarities}} to The Coachman from Pinocchio, {{in the sense}} that she transforms humans into pigs in a similar way <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> of Pleasure Island were transformed into donkeys. Upon gaining employment at the bathhouse, Yubaba's seizure of Chihiro's true name symbolically kills the child, who must then assume adulthood. She then undergoes a rite of passage according to the monomyth format; to recover continuity with her past, Chihiro must create a new identity.|$|E
5|$|A week-long {{visit to}} White House Farm had been {{arranged}} for the August at the Bambers' request; the plan was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> would visit their grandparents with Sheila before going on holiday to Norway with their father. Daniel and Nicholas were reluctant {{to stay at the}} farm. They disliked that June made them pray, and in the car on the way asked their father to speak to her about it. In addition Daniel had become a vegetarian and was worried about being forced to eat meat. When their father dropped them off at the house on 4 August, {{it was the last time}} he saw them. The boys are buried together in Highgate Cemetery. Sheila was cremated, and the casket with her ashes was placed in their coffin.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{visited the}} farm {{on the evening}} of Tuesday, 6 August. He told the court that his parents {{suggested}} to Sheila that evening <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> be placed in day-time foster care with a local family. Bamber said Sheila did not seem bothered by the suggestion and had simply said she would rather stay in London. The boys had been in foster care before, although in London rather than near White House Farm, and it had not appeared to cause a problem for Sheila. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Ferguson, told the Court of Appeal in 2002 that any suggestion that the children be removed from her care would have provoked a strong reaction from Sheila, but that she might have welcomed daytime help.|$|E

5|$|Beiderbecke {{attended}} Davenport High School from 1919 to 1921. During this time, {{he sat in}} {{and played}} professionally with various bands, including those of Wilbur Hatch, Floyd Bean and Carlisle Evans. In the spring of 1920 he performed for the school's Vaudeville Night, singing in a vocal quintet called the Black Jazz Babies and playing his horn. He also performed, {{at the invitation of}} his friend Fritz Putzier, in Neal Buckley's Novelty Orchestra. The group was hired for a gig in December 1920, but a complaint was lodged with the American Federation of Musicians, Local 67, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> did not have union cards. In an audition before a union executive, Beiderbecke was forced to sight read and failed. He did not earn his card.|$|E
5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boys</b> have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E
5|$|When {{his brother}} King Edward IV died in April 1483, Richard was named Lord Protector {{of the realm}} for Edward's eldest son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. Arrangements were made for Edward's {{coronation}} on 22 June 1483; but, before the young king could be crowned, the marriage of his parents was declared bigamous and therefore invalid, making their children officially illegitimate and thus barring them from inheriting the throne. On 25 June, an assembly of Lords and commoners endorsed a declaration to this effect and proclaimed Richard the rightful king. The following day, Richard III began his reign, and he was crowned on 6 July 1483. The young princes, Edward {{and his younger brother}} Richard, Duke of York, were not seen in public after August, and accusations circulated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> had been murdered on Richard's orders.|$|E

5|$|When {{they are}} young, Sam breaks into the orphanage {{he was thrown}} out of to get to Nathan, and tell him some grim news. To make up for the bad part, Sam leads Nathan to the house of Evelyn,a {{historian}} who was legally sold their mother's belongings. They attempt to retrieve the items, but are caught. Evelyn called the police before she knew <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> were the offspring of Cassandra Morgan, an employee of hers. Evelyn collapses from her lung disease and the boys are associated with her death. They flee, and Sam prompts Nathan that they can become explorers, under the new surname of Drake. It is implied that Sam , around 19 or 20 years old was behind bars when Nathan around 14 or 15 years old stole Francis Drake's ring in Columbia, and when he first partnered with Victor Sullivan, he presumably later met Victor but never saw him eye to eye, and distrusted him.|$|E
5|$|Producers chose {{boys who}} were {{students}} of Tariq bin Ziad High School. The school was {{holding on to the}} notion of a united Iraq, even as the country was becoming increasingly racially and religiously segregated. Having worked in Iraq in 2003, Winter knew that the Baghdad district Karrada was mixed and integrated with high numbers of Shiites and Christians. She asked her former driver and translator, who had attended the school, if he would contact the principal. Initially the school was suspicious of their intentions, but decided to trust the judgement of Winter's translator. Principal Ra'ad Jawad selected eight boys {{to take part in the}} documentary because he knew they could be discreet about making the documentary, would not get bored, and would remain committed to filming their lives for a year. The producers wanted their cast to include girls, and had found a school and families willing to take part in the documentary, but the then-Minister of Education refused to let them take part. Jawad travelled to London to meet the producers and he was trained to operate the video cameras <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> were to use. The cameras and tapes were sent into Iraq via the BBC News department, which were then passed onto the school. Jawad and two Iraqi associate producers trained the boys how to use the cameras. Two months into filming, four of the boys dropped out of the project, leaving Hayder Khalid, Anmar Refat, Ali Shadman, and Mohammad Raed. O'Mahoney and Winter never met the boys while the documentary was being produced because it was such a high-risk assignment.|$|E
25|$|Graphic {{video footage}} shot by law {{enforcement}} officers in 2009 shows 6 Romani boys aged between 6-16 being forced to strip naked, kiss, and slap each other. It is alleged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> were then set upon by police dogs, {{with at least two}} sustaining serious injury. Officers attempted to justify their behaviour on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> were suspected of theft against an elderly citizen. However, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment by police, regardless of whether a crime has been suspected or committed, is prohibited under international law.|$|E

25|$|Miss Eirlys Edwards, a {{clerk in}} Newport Education Department (with no {{training}} or experience in matters of child welfare), testified {{on the second day}} that she visited Bank Farm on 20 December 1944, and observed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> were treated with little affection, and while Terence appeared to be well cared for, Dennis appeared ill and frightened; she asked Mrs Gough to call a doctor to examine him, which she said she would do. She had recommended to her superiors <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> be removed and Mr W. J. Edmonds, Newport's Deputy Director of Education, confirmed that he had requested Shropshire Education Committee to do so, although the Goughs had not yet been informed of this decision.|$|E
25|$|On 30 January 1406, the Yongle Emperor {{expressed}} horror {{when the}} Ryukyuans castrated {{some of their}} own children to become eunuchs to serve in the Ming imperial palace. The emperor said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> who were castrated were innocent and did not deserve castration, and he returned the boys to Ryukyu and instructed them not to send eunuchs again.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} day of the committal {{proceedings}} Terence gave another three hours of testimony about their mistreatment. The following day he was recalled again and admitted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> had sometimes misbehaved and deserved to be punished. Gough had played cricket and football with them and the Goughs insisted the boys said their prayers every night. This time he said that they all ate the same food.|$|E

5000|$|Newspaper {{accounts}} {{differ with}} regard to the initial reaction between <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> and Lessie Dunbar. [...] While one account indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> immediately shouted [...] "Mother" [...] upon seeing her and the two then embraced, another said only <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> cried and quoted Lessie Dunbar as saying she was unsure whether he was her son. Other newspaper accounts quote both the Dunbars as initially stating doubts as to <b>the</b> <b>boy's</b> identity. There were similar contradictions in newspaper accounts of <b>the</b> <b>boy's</b> first sighting of the Dunbars' younger son, Alonzo, with one newspaper claiming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> showed no sign of recognizing Alonzo, while another saying <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> recognized him instantly, called him by name and kissed him. The next day, after bathing <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> Lessie Dunbar said she positively identified his moles and scars and was then certain that he was her son. <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> returned to Opelousas with the Dunbars to a parade and much fanfare celebrating the [...] "homecoming".|$|R
25|$|In 2013 in Campbellton, New Brunswick, Canada, two {{brothers}} of ages four and six were reportedly {{killed by a}} 14– to 16-ft, 45-kg African rock python kept by a pet shop owner. The circumstances of the incident prompted some skepticism from experts {{not involved in the}} case, An autopsy showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> died of asphyxiation, which does not fit with how constricting snakes kill. The owner was charged with criminal negligence for not adequately protecting the boys from the snake. (See main article).|$|E
25|$|The verse form of Doctrinale in fact arose by accident. Alexander {{had been}} {{employed}} by the bishop of Dol-de-Bretagne to teach Latin to his nephews, using the grammar of Priscian. He had noticed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> could not remember Priscian as prose, so he translated its rules into verse form. When Alexander was away one day, the bishop asked his nephews a grammar question, and was surprised when they answered in verse. The bishop persuaded Alexander to compile and to publish an entire book of such verses, which became the Doctrinale.|$|E
25|$|Lemieux {{was born}} in Montreal, to Pierrette, a stay-at-home mom, and Jean-Guy Lemieux, an engineer. He and his older {{brothers}} Alain and Richard {{grew up in a}} working class family in the Ville-Émard district. Mario began practicing hockey at age three in his basement; before using real equipment, he and his brothers used wooden kitchen spoons as hockey sticks and bottle caps as pucks. His father created a rink on the front lawn so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> could practice as much as possible, and according to family legend, the family sometimes packed snow onto the living room carpet so the brothers could practice indoors when it was dark.|$|E
