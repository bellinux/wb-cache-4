40|$|Metalworking fluids (MWFs) {{are used}} in {{manufacturing}} as coolants, lubricants,mand corrosion inhibitors. Growing MWF acquisition and disposal costs, together with concerns about microbiological health hazards and environmental impact have led to increased interest in MWF recycling, contaminant control, and alternative application strategies. Membrane filtration can remove microbes, particulate, and <b>tramp</b> <b>oils</b> that contaminate metalworking fluids and {{has the potential to}} reduce health risks and extend MWF life in the machine tool industry. However, poorly understood relationships between the compatibility of metalworking fluid ingredients, contaminants, membrane materials, and membrane pore-size distributions have precluded the widespread industrial application of the technology. This research assesses the mechanisms of productivity decline during the microfiltration of an uncontaminated synthetic MWF using aluminum oxide membranes. It is revealed that while the majority of synthetic MWF ingredients have a negligible impact on microfiltration productivity, specialty additives such as lubricants, defoamers, and biocides can significantly reduce productivity. This is due to adsorption of these ingredients to the membrane surface that serves to increase resistance to MWF flow through the membrane pores. MWF ingredient characteristics such as hydrophilic/hydrophobic content and electrostatic charge can influence adsorption and productivity-loss during microfiltration. These findings demonstrate that the chemistry and concentration of specialty additives are important to account for during the design of membrane filtration systems for MWF recycling.

30|$|Scenario 1 {{consists}} of the basic coolant obtained from a lathe machine after 6 months of usage. Scenario 2 {{consists of}} the basic coolant mixed with 10 % of <b>tramp</b> <b>oil.</b> The amount of <b>tramp</b> <b>oil</b> in the effluent waste {{was found to be}} between 1 % and 16 % [18]. <b>Tramp</b> <b>oil</b> originates as lubrication oil seeping out from the slideways and washing into the coolant mixture, as the protective film with which the steel supplier coats the bar stock to prevent rusting, or as hydraulic oil leaks. In extreme cases, it {{can be seen as a}} film or skin on the surface of the coolant or as floating specks of oil. A <b>tramp</b> <b>oil</b> level above 2 % could cause health issues due to emulsification [18]. Scenario 3 {{consists of the}} basic coolant mixed with 10 % oil and around 10 g of ferrous material chips in near-powdered form [19]. Generally the effluent waste from a grinding machine includes minute particles of iron and worn-out or burnt-out abrasives from the wheel, which are difficult to segregate from the used coolant. The complexity of the fluid is compounded by contamination from a combination of substances from the manufacturing process, such as tramp oils, hydraulic fluids, and particulate matter from the machining operations [19]. Scenario 4 consists of 10 % sludge mixed with the basic coolant. Sludge is a heavy residue that lies at the bottom of the sump or in a drum where the used coolants are stored before disposal. Microorganisms such as bacteria tend to multiply and grow in the sludge that is present in the effluent waste. Scenario 5 consists of the basic coolant mixed with 10 % sludge and 2 % solvent. Solvents are used to clean and degrease the finished goods and even certain machine parts after the machining operation. The effluents, in combination with oil and grease, can form a toxic substance for the aquatic organisms [8].|$|E

40|$|Aqueous {{solutions}} (mixed waste) {{generated from}} various LLNL operations, such as debris washing, sample preparation and analysis, and equipment maintenance and cleanout, were combined for storage in the B 695 tank farm. Prior to combination the individual waste streams had different codes {{depending on the}} particular generating process and waste characteristics. The largest streams were CWC 132, 791, 134, 792. Several smaller waste streams were also included. This combined waste stream was treated at LLNL's waste treatment facility using a vacuum filtration and cool vapor evaporation process in preparation for discharge to sanitary sewer. Prior to discharge, the treated waste stream was sampled {{and the results were}} reviewed by LLNL's water monitoring specialists. The treated solution was discharged following confirmation that it met the discharge criteria. A major source, accounting for 50 % for this waste stream, is metal machining, cutting and grinding operations in the engineering machine shops in B 321 /B 131. An additional 7 % was from similar operations in B 131 and B 132 S. This waste stream primarily contains metal cuttings from machined parts, machining coolant and water, with small amounts of <b>tramp</b> <b>oil</b> from the machining and grinding equipment. Several waste reduction measures for the B 321 machine shop have been taken, including the use of a small point-of-use filtering/tramp-oil coalescing/UV-sterilization coolant recycling unit, and improved management techniques (testing and replenishing) for coolants. The recycling unit had some operational problems during 2006. The machine shop is planning to have it repaired in the near future.

40|$|The primary {{processes}} used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) {{for treatment}} of radioactively contaminated machine coolants are industrial waste treatment and in situ carbon adsorption. These two processes simplify approaches to meeting the sanitary sewer discharge limits and subsequent Land Disposal Restriction criteria for hazardous and mixed wastes (40 CFR 268). Several relatively simple technologies are used in industrial water treatment. These technologies are considered Best Demonstrated Available Technologies, or BDAT, by the Environmental Protection Agency. The machine coolants are primarily aqueous and contain water soluble oil consisting of ethanol amine emulsifiers derived from fatty acids, both synthetic and natural. This emulsion carries away metal turnings from a part being machined on a lathe or other machining tool. When the coolant becomes spent, it contains chlorosolvents carried over from other cutting operations {{as well as a}} fair amount of <b>tramp</b> <b>oil</b> from machine bearings. This results in a multiphasic aqueous waste that requires treatment of metal and organic contaminants. During treatment, any dissolved metals are oxidized with hydrogen peroxide. Once oxidized, these metals are flocculated with ferric sulfate and precipitated with sodium hydroxide, and then the precipitate is filtered through diatomaceous earth. The emulsion is broken up by acidifying the coolant. Solvents and oils are adsorbed using powdered carbon. This carbon is easily separated from the remaining coolant by vacuum filtration...|$|E
30|$|Ferrous block metals {{are used}} {{frequently}} {{in large quantities}} in various sectors of industry for making automotive, furniture, electrical and mechanical items, body parts for consumables, and so forth. During the manufacturing stage, the block metals are subjected {{to some form of}} material removal process either through turning, grinding, milling, or drilling operations to obtain the final product. Wastes are generated from the machining process in the form of effluent waste, solid waste, atmospheric emission, and energy emission. These wastes, if not recycled or treated properly before disposal, will have a detrimental impact on the environment through air, water, and soil pollution. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to determine the impact of the effluent waste from the machining process on the environment through water analysis. A twofold study is carried out to determine the impact of the effluent waste on the water stream. The preliminary study consists of a scenario analysis where five scenarios are drawn out using substances such as spent coolant, <b>tramp</b> <b>oil,</b> solvent, powdered chips, and sludge, which are commonly found in the effluent waste. The wastes are prepared according to the scenarios and are disposed through the Institute of Product Design and Manufacturing (IPROM) storm water drain. Samples of effluent waste are collected at specific locations according to the APHA method and are tested for parameters such as pH, ammoniacal nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, and total suspended solids. A subsequent study is done by collecting 30 samples of the effluent waste from the machining operations from two small- and medium-scale enterprise locations and the IPROM workshop to test the quality of water. The results obtained from the tests showed high values of chemical oxygen demand, ammoniacal nitrogen, and total suspended solids when compared with the Standard B specification for inland water bodies as specified by the Department of Environment, Malaysia.|$|E
