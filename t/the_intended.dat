5|$|All tiger sharks {{generally}} swim slowly, which, {{combined with}} cryptic coloration, may make them difficult for prey to detect in some habitats. They are especially well camouflaged against dark backgrounds. Despite their sluggish appearance, tiger sharks {{are one of}} the strongest swimmers of the carcharhinid sharks. Once the shark has come close, a speed burst allows it to reach <b>the</b> <b>intended</b> prey before it can escape.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only the}} first movement, copied by Voigt, is fully {{accepted}} as having been completed, <b>the</b> <b>intended</b> scale and general character of the Eighth Symphony may be inferred from several sources. Sibelius's correspondence with Voigt and with his binders, in 1933 and 1938 respectively, indicates {{the possibility of a}} notably large-scale work. Apart from Nils-Eric Fougstedt's 1947 observation, there are also indications from Voigt that the work may have contained choral elements, along the lines of Beethoven's Ninth.|$|E

5|$|Biological control {{can affect}} {{biodiversity}} through predation, parasitism, pathogenicity, competition, or other attacks on non-target species. An introduced control {{does not always}} target only <b>the</b> <b>intended</b> pest species; it can also target native species. In Hawaii during the 1940s parasitic wasps were introduced to control a lepidopteran pest and the wasps are still found there today. This may {{have a negative impact}} on the native ecosystem, however, host range and impacts need to be studied before declaring their impact on the environment.|$|E
5|$|Courageous carried four BL 15-inch Mk I guns in two {{hydraulically}} powered twin gun turrets, designated 'A' and 'Y' {{from front to}} rear. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen BL 4-inch Mk IX guns mounted in six manually powered mounts. The mount placed three breeches too close together, causing the 23 loaders to get in one another's way, and preventing <b>the</b> <b>intended</b> high rate of fire. A pair of QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted abreast the mainmast on Courageous. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and carried 10 torpedoes for them.|$|E

Sometimes an emergency minimum decompression schedule and a more conservative schedule will be generated to allow the diver further options.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the late}} 1950s-era threat of surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAMs) that could threaten high-altitude aircraft, seen in practice in the 1960 U-2 incident, <b>the</b> <b>intended</b> use of B-52 was changed {{to serve as a}} low-level penetration bomber during a foreseen attack upon the Soviet Union, as terrain masking provided an effective method of avoiding radar and thus the threat of the SAMs. Although never intended for the low level role, the B-52's flexibility allowed it to outlast several intended successors as the nature of aerial warfare changed. The B-52's large airframe enabled the addition of multiple design improvements, new equipment, and other adaptations over its service life.|$|E

5|$|Even so, {{and partly}} because of Sickles's {{unexpected}} location, Longstreet's assault did not proceed according to Lee's plan. Instead of wheeling left to join a simultaneous two-division push {{on either side of the}} Emmitsburg Road, Hood's division attacked in a more easterly direction than intended, and McLaws's and Anderson's divisions deployed brigade by brigade, in an en echelon style of attack, also heading more to the east than <b>the</b> <b>intended</b> northeast.|$|E

5|$|Flight tests {{revealed}} difficult handling, {{and a lack}} of power due to the non-availability of <b>the</b> <b>intended</b> ACh-30BF engines. Flight tests continued without the waist guns and their gunner until the ACh-30BF's were fitted between May and July 1944. Despite modifications, the aircraft still suffered from poor controllability at low speeds and high weights as well as very poor gliding performance. Throughout the flight tests the engines performed satisfactorily in the air, but were found {{to be very difficult to}} start in low ambient temperatures and had slow response to throttle movements. Further development was canceled.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{controversy}} and {{the demolition of}} the Star Ferry Pier in Edinburgh Place in early 2007, activists declared Queen's Pier the next battle-ground against the conservation policy of the Government of Hong Kong. The criticism received over its handling of the Star Ferry Pier caused Michael Suen, the Secretary for Housing, Planning and Lands, to propose a piece-by-piece relocation of the pier to a new location on the reclaimed waterfront during a Legco session on 21 March 2007. The Government later unveiled four design options for such relocation. <b>The</b> <b>intended</b> closure of the pier was 26 April 2007.|$|E

He continued playing with Carter into 1998. In the late 1990s, Taborn also recorded with saxophonist Roscoe Mitchell (Taborn's first appearance on the ECM label), and for techno producer Carl Craig's album Programmed as part of Innerzone Orchestra.|$|E
