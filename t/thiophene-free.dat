40|$|Rate {{studies were}} made for the oxygen-free {{reaction}} between steel powder and 1 N H~SO~, both uninhibited and inhibited. In particular, it was shown that the retardation of the reaction by organic polar compounds was influenced more markedly by molecular structure than by molecular weight or area. This study is a cont inuat ion of the work reported by Hackerman and Cook (1) on the adsorption of polar organic compounds on steel and their effect on its react iv ity in acid solution. A comprehensive theory of the general adsorption of organic inhibitors and subsequent inhib i t ion of acid dissolution by polar izat ion of the anodic reaction was given by Hackerman and Makrides (2). The invest igat ions under taken here were {{for the purpose of}} obta in ing addit ional in format ion as a basis for confirming or deny ing the theory as stated. Experimental The essential features of the exper imenta l ap-proach have been described (1). The pr inciple used was to determine grav imetr ica l ly the increase in weight of a sample of steel powder on being exposed to a solution of benzene contain ing the organic in-hibitor. The metal used was SAE 1010 steel powder purchased from the Vanad ium-A l loys Steel Com-pany. It had a composit ion of 0. 10 C, 0. 10 St, 0. 24 Mn, 0. 012 P, 0. 012 S, and test Fe. It was purchased as powder which passed No. 100 sieve mesh and further sieved, the 140 to 200 range being used. The benzene was <b>thiophene-free,</b> C. P. grade and was free also from H~S, CS 2, and SO 2. The polar organic compounds were obtained from several sources. Hexamethy len imine and heptamethy len i-mine were obtained from Dr. P. D.

40|$|Organic bulk {{heterojunction}} (BHJ) photovoltaics {{have received}} substantial interest as promising sources of renewable energy. To better understand their performance, {{it is important}} to have an accurate picture of the material distribution through the depth of the photoactive layer. Recent advances in argon cluster ion beams as sputter sources in conjunction with ToF-SIMS analysis have enabled gentle depth profiling of such layers. The photoactive layer of a BHJ photovoltaic cell is typically a blend of a donor and acceptor material. The most widely used acceptor material in such devices is PCBM. Commonly employed donors are P 3 HT, MDMO PPV, PCDTBT and DPP 5 T. In this study, we systematically extend previous investigations of the thiophene-containing donor materials to a <b>thiophene-free</b> donor material (MDMO PPV) in order to study the effect of this unit on observed ionization effects. We propose general guidelines regarding the optimisation of critical parameters, such as the choice of analysis beam, dose ratio between the analysis and the sputter beam, cluster size and energy of the sputter beam that provide plausible depth profiles. For instance, in each of these systems, it has been observed that sputter beams exceeding the value of 10 eV/atom cause irreversible damage [1] in these organic layers. Quantification of the depth profiles is posed with several challenges. Firstly, there is a strong matrix effect on the steady state intensity of the fullerene ion, which peaks at different sample composition for each donor:acceptor system. This matrix effect has a complex relation with the concentration of strongly electronegative elements in the donor molecule. Secondly, we observe a large intensity enhancement of the fullerene ion at the interface between the organic layer and the substrate. We elucidate the origin of this enhancement by comparing Arn+ depth profiles obtained by ToF-SIMS with those obtained from XPS. Taking these effects into consideration, we are able to fully quantify all donor:acceptor systems from this study and to confirm segregation effects at the surface and at the interface with the substrate. Sputter yield variation between the polymer, the fullerene material and their mixtures have also been investigated using the models from Seah [2] and Cumpson [3] et al. The fitting parameters show a strong dependence on the composition of each system. The relevance of these models for predictive purposes on our samples will also be discussed. References [1] T.
