However, when the actual results for <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> were announced Cowboys & Aliens won <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> with $36.4 million just beating out The Smurfs, which grossed $35.6 million. The film grossed $100,240,551 in the U.S. and Canada (making it the 500th $100 million domestic movie) as well as $74,581,774 internationally, bringing its worldwide total to $174,822,325.
