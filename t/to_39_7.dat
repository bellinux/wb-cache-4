Two models for AF, namely, fixed gain and fixed power relaying, have been extensively studied. In fixed gain relaying, the relay gain is fixed but its transmit power varies {{as a function of}} the source-relay (SR) channel gain. In fixed power relaying, the relay’s instantaneous transmit power is fixed, but its gain varies. We propose a general AF cooperation model in which an average transmit power constrained relay jointly adapts its gain and transmit power {{as a function of the}} channel gains. We derive the optimal AF gain policy that minimizes the fading-averaged symbol error probability (SEP) of MPSK and present insightful and tractable lower and upper bounds for it.

Utilizing an hierarchical linear regression model we were able <b>to</b> explain <b>39.</b> <b>7</b> % of the variance in PTSD symptoms.

40|$|The {{indirect}} haemagglutination (IHA) test using sensitized turkey erythrocytes and the {{indirect immunofluorescence assay}} (IgM-IFA) was confirmed to be sensitive in the detection of a recent or current Pseudomonas pseudomallei infection in 19 culture-confirmed Singapore melioidosis patients. All {{were found to have}} antibody titres from 4 to 32768 in the IHA test and 10 to 320 in the IgM-IFA test. When these tests were employed on sera from 16 immigrant Thai construction workers who died of sudden unexplained death syndrome (SUDS) and 73 healthy Thai fellow workers, 93. 8 % and 68. 8 % of SUDS cases had IHA titre of {{greater than or equal to}} 4 and IgM-IFA titre of greater than or equal to 10 respectively, in contrast <b>to</b> <b>39.</b> <b>7</b> % and 12. 3 % found among healthy Thai workers. These data indicate that at the time of death, most of the SUDS patients had an active infection with P. pseudomallei, possibly resulting from reactivation of a latent infection. The aetiological role of P. pseudomallei as the major cause of SUDS is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Determination of biokinetic {{parameters}} for tyrosol (4 -hydroxyphenethyl alcohol) and caffeic acid (3, 4 dihydroxy cynammic acid) (the two most representative phenolic compounds present in Olive Mill Wastewater, OMW) was achieved using a simplified Monod kinetic model. The experimental procedure utilized acclimated microbial cultures to which substrate was added {{at low concentration}} relative to the microbial mass. Nonlinear regression analysis confirmed the application of this approach {{by being able to}} accurately predict substrate utilization rates. Values for the maximum specific growth rate, ?max, and the half-saturation coefficient, Ks, for tyrosol ranged from 0. 4 to 3. 5 days- 1 and from 6. 2 to 18. 5 mg/ 1 respectively. The corresponding values for caffeic acid were 0. 9 to 2. 3 days- 1 and 9. 5 <b>to</b> <b>39.</b> <b>7</b> mg/ 1. The biomass yield coefficients for tyrosol and caffeic acid were 0. 55 and 0. 62 mg VSS/mg substrate and the corresponding decay rates were 0. 15 and 0. 12 days- 1. The simplified approach yielded results that were comparable to values reported for other phenolic compounds determined using more sophisticated experimental and mathematical techniques...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{predominant}} bacterial genera {{present in}} the fish tank water of a sustainable tilapia fish farm system were found <b>to</b> be Vibrio (<b>39.</b> <b>7</b> - 69 %), Aeromonas (16 - 21. 6 %), Pseudomanas (1. 8 - 2. 0 %), and Shewanella (4. 0 - 9. 9 %). Each of the 69 Vibrio isolates obtained on March 5, 2003 from tilapia fish tank water was subjected to RAPD-PCR analysis separately with three decamer primers PB 1, PB 4 and HLWL 74. Based on the analysis of band patterns, the 69 Vi-brio isolates yielded 32 RAPD types with primer PB 4, 40 with primer PB 1, and 38 with primer HLWL 74 respectively. There were 67 composite RAPD profiles derived from the 69 Vibrio isolates. A total of 9 genomic Vibrio clusters were identified. These results indicated that a considerable genomic heterogeneity existed among the Vibrio isolates {{and that no one}} clone exerted numerical dominance among these Vibrio isolates...|$|R
40|$|A hybrid {{approach}} has been adopted by {{using a combination of}} colloidal graphite (CG) as a conducting filler, 5 -lithium sulfoisophthalic (LiSIPA) acid as a dopant, and polyaniline (PANI) as a matrix to prepare LiSIPA doped PANI–CG composites. The thermal stability (∼ 300 °C) and electrical conductivity (67. 4 [*]S/cm at 17. 4 % CG content) have been improved significantly as compared to PANI doped with conventional inorganic dopants like HCl or H 2 SO 4 (130 – 150 °C). The maximum shielding effectiveness value was found <b>to</b> be − <b>39.</b> <b>7</b> [*]dB. X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy showed a systematic shifting of the characteristic peaks and bands with increase in the amount of CG, which indicates significant interaction exists between CG and PANI. The UV–Vis spectra showed the characteristic bands of PANI, with a shift to shorter wavelength with increase in the CG content. The interaction mechanism between doped PANI and CG in the resultant composites has been proposed...|$|R
40|$|In this work, an {{effective}} gas diffusion coefficient of a porous medium {{was measured using}} photothermal deflection (PD) technique. An in-house made Loschmidt diffusion cell with a photothermal-deflection probe were employed to measure the effective gas diffusion coefficient of a gas diffusion layer (GDL) with a porosity 3 ̆b 5 2 ̆ 248 0. 7. The concentration evolutions of CO 2 in O 2 with and without the GDL were measured, respectively, using a transverse normal PD technique. The concentration variations were used to deduce the gas diffusion coefficients in the presence and absence of the GDL by solving mass diffusion equations. The effective gas diffusion coefficient of the GDL was calculated from the diffusion coefficients using a model of an equivalent resistance to diffusion and found <b>to</b> be 4. <b>39</b> <b>7</b> 10 - 62 ̆ 009 m 2 s- 1, demonstrating that PD technique can be employed to determine the effective gas diffusion coefficient of a porous medium.
