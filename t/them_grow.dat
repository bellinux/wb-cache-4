5|$|Hundreds is {{a mobile}} puzzle video game where players touch circles to make <b>them</b> <b>grow</b> without overlapping. In the game's 100 levels, the player interacts with {{different}} types of circles to bring a counter to the number 100. The game was developed and published by Semi Secret Software in collaboration with Greg Wohlwend and was released for iOS on January 7, 2013, and on Android later that year.|$|E
5|$|The star {{formation}} process naturally {{results in the}} appearance of accretion disks around young stellar objects. At the age of about 1million years, 100% of stars may have such disks. This conclusion {{is supported by the}} discovery of the gaseous and dusty disks around protostars and T Tauri stars as well as by theoretical considerations. Observations of these disks show that the dust grains inside <b>them</b> <b>grow</b> in size on short (thousand-year) time scales, producing 1centimeter sized particles.|$|E
5|$|In Hundreds, players touch circles to make <b>them</b> <b>grow</b> without overlapping. There are 100 puzzles that {{increase}} in complexity. The Flash version was much simpler in design, and added circles onscreen {{as the game}} progressed. The iOS version added a new gameplay mode and a narrative element based on ciphers and codes, and was released on January 7, 2013 for iPhone and iPad, and later for Android. It was nominated for several Independent Games Festival awards, and The Atlantic critic Ian Bogost wrote that the game functioned like a design object, a feat unique for the video game medium.|$|E

5|$|At Hinata House, Keitarō meets Naru Narusegawa, {{who is also}} {{studying}} to enter Tokyo University. Naru ranks first {{in the whole of}} Japan on the practice exams, and Keitarō convinces her to help him study. As the two of <b>them</b> <b>grow</b> closer through their studies, and after Keitarō accidentally reads a small section of Naru's diary, he becomes increasingly convinced that Naru may be the girl with whom he made the promise. On {{the second day of the}} Tokyo University exam, Keitarō asks Naru about the promise and is stunned when she tells him he is mistaken. Despite their studying, and Naru's mock exam results, they both fail the exams. The pair then have an argument and independently run off to Kyoto to clear their heads. While on their trip they settle their differences and meet Mutsumi Otohime, who lives in Okinawa and is also studying for the Tokyo University exams.|$|E
25|$|Kiwifruit may {{be eaten}} raw, made into juices, used in baked goods, {{prepared}} with meat or {{used as a}} garnish. The whole fruit, including the skin, is suitable for human consumption; however, the skin is often discarded due to its texture. Sliced kiwifruit has long {{been used as a}} garnish atop whipped cream on pavlova, a meringue-based dessert. Traditionally in China, kiwifruit was not eaten for pleasure, but was given as medicine to children to help <b>them</b> <b>grow</b> and to women who have given birth to help them recover.|$|E
500|$|Players touch circles onscreen to make <b>them</b> <b>grow</b> in size. Numbers {{within the}} circles count upwards with the {{duration}} of the touch. If a growing circle overlaps another, the player must restart the puzzle. Levels are completed when the numbers within the circles total 100. There are 100 levels that progress in complexity from a simple circle with no nearby obstructions to the advanced mechanics, such as linked circles that need to be touched at once, buzzsaws that reset the numbers within the circles, and snowflakes that freeze other circles.|$|E

Aural Intensity is named runner-up, and Vocal Adrenaline wins, with New Directions coming in last. Emma argues with Figgins about the club's future, but he remains intent on {{disbanding}} it, since it failed to place. Will has accepted their loss, and professes his love for Emma and kisses her. Sue overhears New Directions' performance of [...] "To Sir With Love" [...] in appreciation of all that Will has done to help <b>them</b> <b>grow.</b> It is revealed that Sue voted for New Directions to win, and has agreed to end her blackmail of Principal Figgins in exchange for giving New Directions {{at least one more}} year to prove themselves and win Regionals. She explains to Will that she may not like him, but she respects his work with the students.

500|$|Wright {{intended}} for the film to be [...] "as subjective as possible" [...] in being from Elizabeth's perspective; the audience first glimpses Darcy when she does. This focus on Elizabeth features some dramatic changes from the novel. Knightley's Elizabeth has an [...] "increasingly aloof and emotionally distant" [...] relationship with her family. Evidence {{of this can be}} seen with Elizabeth's gradual alienation from Jane as the film progresses; this is in contrast to the book, where Elizabeth confides more of her feelings to Jane after difficult events. Wright wanted to create a [...] "real" [...] relationship between the two sisters and have <b>them</b> <b>grow</b> apart, as he thought the book depicted them as too [...] "syrupy." [...] Moggach's intent was for Elizabeth to [...] "keep secrets to herself. They are a great burden to her... As she keeps all this to herself, we feel for her more and more. The truest comedy, I believe, is born from pain." ...|$|E
500|$|Unique {{terminology}} is {{used when}} referring to games within the series. In 2007, Yoshizumi announced two classes of Tales games, [...] "Mothership Titles" [...] and [...] "Escort Titles". [...] "Mothership" [...] essentially means [...] "Main series", where as [...] "Escort" [...] essentially means [...] "Spinoff". One of the recurring {{differences between the two}} game types internally is that [...] "Escort" [...] titles don't supply inspiration for main entries in the series, but draw the most popular elements from them. The games are also frequently given what is called a [...] "Characteristic Genre Name", which is essentially a short subtitle or phrase that outlines the game's overall theme. The main reason for this, as stated by Yoshizumi, was that the series was not seen as a role-playing series by the development team, but rather [...] "Character Playing Game", with the player learning about the game's characters and watching <b>them</b> <b>grow</b> rather than using them as avatars: the genre names are meant to distinguish them from other role-playing games. The terms, however, are largely removed from the English localized versions. There are also terms that are used in remakes or ports of games: [...] "R" [...] stands for [...] "remake" [...] or [...] "Re-imagination" [...] (as in Hearts R), while [...] "F" [...] in Graces f stood for [...] "future", in reference to the game's extra story content.|$|E
500|$|Singers and {{bands of}} various genres have covered {{the song in}} their own style. Scottish band Marmaduke Duke {{performed}} a cover version in April 2009 on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge show. In October 2009, it was released on Radio 1's Live Lounge – Volume 4, a compilation of Live Lounge recordings. Australian singer Stan Walker sang a jazzier version of the song on the seventh series of Australian Idol in October 2009. The same year, elementary school group PS22 chorus covered [...] "Single Ladies" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] (2009) during Billboards annual Women In Music luncheon held at The Pierre in New York City. In her short-lived Broadway revue [...] "All About Me" [...] in March 2010, Dame Edna Everage performed {{a version of the}} song with backup dancers Gregory Butler and Jon-Paul Mateo. It was also covered by Jeff Tweedy and British singer-songwriter Alan Pownall. According to Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly, Tweedy sang only a few bars; he gave [...] "Single Ladies" [...] an acoustic feel and recited the rest of the song's lyrics. He performed the hand movements that Beyoncé and her dancers do in the song's video. Pomplamoose, an American indie music duo consisting of Jack Conte and Nataly Dawn, recorded a cover of [...] "Single Ladies" [...] on video, which makes use of split screens to show Dawn on vocals and Conte playing the instruments. Inspired by the avant-garde Dogme 95 movement in cinema, Conte began to record songs on video as a quick way to create [...] "organic and raw" [...] music. They chose [...] "Single Ladies" [...] as they believed that it would help <b>them</b> <b>grow</b> their audience.|$|E

2500|$|While Unconditional Parenting (2005) is Kohn's {{first book}} that deals {{primarily}} with raising children, he devoted two chapters to this topic in Punished by Rewards (1993). He discusses {{the need for}} parents {{to keep in mind}} their long-term goals for their children, such as helping <b>them</b> <b>grow</b> into responsible and caring people, rather than on short-term goals, such as obedience. The key question, he argues, is [...] "What do kids need – and how do we meet those needs?" ...|$|E

That's why I'm writing. Not only to teach children about the disabilities or the diseases, but to help <b>them</b> <b>grow</b> up to be better, more caring people.
