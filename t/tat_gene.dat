25|$|HIV, the {{retrovirus}} {{that causes}} AIDS in humans, produces a single primary RNA transcript, which is alternatively spliced in multiple ways to produce over 40 different mRNAs. Equilibrium among differentially spliced transcripts provides multiple mRNAs encoding different {{products that are}} required for viral multiplication. One of the differentially spliced transcripts contains the <b>tat</b> <b>gene,</b> in which exon 2 is a cassette exon that may be skipped or included. The inclusion of tat exon 2 in the RNA is regulated by competition between the splicing repressor hnRNP A1 and the SR protein SC35. Within exon 2 an exonic splicing silencer sequence (ESS) and an exonic splicing enhancer sequence (ESE) overlap. If A1 repressor protein binds to the ESS, it initiates cooperative binding of multiple A1 molecules, extending into the 5’ donor site upstream of exon 2 and preventing the binding of the core splicing factor U2AF35 to the polypyrimidine tract. If SC35 binds to the ESE, it prevents A1 binding and maintains the 5’ donor site in an accessible state for assembly of the spliceosome. Competition between the activator and repressor ensures that both mRNA types (with and without exon 2) are produced.|$|E

Anti-Tat IgG Abs directed against this epitope were found in mice immunized with all tat DNA constructs, whereas different Tat epitopes were detected in mice immunized with the Tat protein. Similarly, IgG 2 a was the predominant isotype in DNA-immunized mice, with both mutants and wild-type <b>tat</b> <b>genes,</b> as compared with protein immunization, which induced mostly IgG 1 and IgG 3. Sera from most immunized mice neutralized the effect of extracellular Tat in activating HIV- 1 replication. A cellular response was also elicited as indicated by the proliferation of splenocytes when stimulated with wild-type Tat. These results indicate that the wild-type Tat Ag is recognized by Abs and T cells induced by DNA immunization with mutated <b>tat</b> <b>genes,</b> suggesting the possible use of these Tat transdominant mutants, lacking viral trans activation activity and capable of blocking wild-type Tat activity, in the development of an anti-HIV- 1 vaccine...|$|R

A comparative genomic analysis in the a-proteobacteria class confirmed the presence of tatA, tatB, and tatC genes in almost all genomes, but significant variations in gene synteny and rearrangements were found in the order Rickettsiales with respect to the typically described operon organization.

The tat response element of HIV- 2 and of SIVmac was more complex than that of HIV- 1. Two structurally similar subelements within the HIV- 2 tat response element could be identified. Both of these subelements were required for optimal transactivation by the HIV- 2 <b>tat</b> <b>gene</b> product. Either of these subelements, however, was sufficient for transactivation by the HIV- 1 <b>tat</b> <b>gene</b> product.

40|$|DNA {{vaccines}} {{have been}} successful in eliciting potent immune responses in mice. Their efficiency, however, is restricted in larger animals. One reason for the limited performance of the DNA vaccines is the lack of molecular strategies to enhance immune responses. Additionally, genes directly cloned from pathogenic organisms may not be efficiently translated in a heterologous host expression system as a consequence of codon bias. To evaluate the influence of codon optimization on the immune response, we elected to use the Tat antigens of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) (subtype C) and HIV- 2, as these viral antigens are poorly immunogenic in natural infection and in experimental immunization and they are functionally important in viral infectivity and pathogenesis. Substituting codons that are optimally used in the mammalian system, we synthetically assembled <b>Tat</b> <b>genes</b> and compared them with the wild-type counterparts in two different mouse strains. Codon-optimized <b>Tat</b> <b>genes</b> induced qualitatively and quantitatively superior immune responses as measured in a T-cell proliferation assay, enzyme-linked immunospot assay, and chromium release assay. Importantly, while the wild-type genes promoted a mixed Th 1 -Th 2 -type cytokine profile, the codon-optimized genes induced a predominantly Th 1 profile. Using a pepscan strategy, we mapped an immunodominant T-helper epitope to the core and basic domains of HIV- 1 Tat. We also identified cross-clade immune responses between HIV- 1 subtype B and C Tat proteins mapped to this T-helper epitope. Developing molecular strategies to optimize the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines is critical for inducing strong immune responses, especially to antigens like Tat. Our identification of a highly conserved T-helper epitope in the first exon of HIV- 1 Tat of subtype C and the demonstration of a cross-clade immune response between subtypes B and C are important for a more rational design of an HIV vaccine...|$|R

Surprisingly, large-scale mutagenesis of the conserved amphipathic regions of TatA and TatB leads only to minor effects on Tat-dependent export suggesting that this particular feature is not central to the translocation mechanism.

It is proposed that this protein domain serves to efficiently target the <b>tat</b> <b>gene</b> product to its appropriate site or substrate within the nucleus of expressing cells...|$|E
40|$|The twin-arginine {{translocation}} (Tat) system catalyzes {{the transport}} of folded proteins across the bacterial plasma membrane or the chloroplast thylakoid membrane. In Escherichia coli and most other species, three important <b>tat</b> <b>genes</b> have been identified but the structure and mechanism of this system are poorly understood; the role and location of TatA are particularly unclear. In this report we have used site-specific mutagenesis to probe the significance of conserved features of the related TatA/B subunits. We find that an apparent 'hinge' region between the transmembrane (TM) span and an adjacent amphipathic region is important in both proteins, in that substitution of turn-inducing residues inhibits the export of a natural Tat substrate. Surprisingly, large-scale mutagenesis of the conserved amphipathic regions of TatA and TatB leads only to minor effects on Tat-dependent export suggesting that this particular feature is not central to the translocation mechanism. This domain is, however, critical for the translocation process and we identify Gly/Pro residues in these regions of TatA/B that are essential for efficient export.

40|$|Several viral trans-activators and a tumor {{promoter}} were examined for {{the ability to}} activate human papillomavirus type 18 (HPV- 18) gene expression. A plasmid containing the HPV- 18 noncoding region placed upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene was cotransfected with different herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) genes into several cell lines. Both HSV- 1 TIF and ICP 0 activated HPV- 18 expression; however, activation by TIF was observed only in epithelial cells, while ICP 0 stimulated expression {{in a wide variety}} of cells. The element activated by both TIF and ICP 0 was mapped to a 229 -base-pair fragment which also contains an HPV- 18 epithelial cell-preferred enhancer. The inclusion of a papillomavirus E 2 trans-activator with TIF and ICP 0 further increased HPV- 18 expression. In contrast, the HSV- 1 ICP 4 and ICP 27 genes, as well as the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 <b>tat</b> <b>genes,</b> were found to have no effect on HPV- 18 expression. In transient assays, the addition of the {{tumor promoter}} 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) also activated HPV- 18 expression. The region of HPV- 18 activated by TPA was localized to a sequence which is homologous to other TPA-responsive elements...|$|R
40|$|Monomethyl {{branched-chain}} {{fatty acids}} (mmBCFAs) {{are essential for}} Caenorhabditis elegans growth and development. To identify factors acting downstream of mmBCFAs for their function in growth regulation, we conducted a genetic screen for suppressors of the L 1 arrest that occurs in animals depleted of the 17 -carbon mmBCFA C 17 ISO. Three of the suppressor mutations defined an unexpected player, the P-type ATPase TAT- 2, which belongs to the flippase family of proteins that are implicated in mediating phospholipid bilayer asymmetry. We provide evidence that TAT- 2, but not other <b>TAT</b> <b>genes,</b> has a specific role in antagonizing the regulatory activity of mmBCFAs in intestinal cells. Interestingly, we found that mutations in tat- 2 also suppress the lethality caused by inhibition of {{the first step in}} sphingolipid biosynthesis. We further showed that the fatty acid side-chains of glycosylceramides contain 20 %- 30 % mmBCFAs and that this fraction is greatly diminished in the absence of mmBCFA biosynthesis. These results suggest a model in which a C 17 ISO-containing sphingolipid may mediate the regulatory functions of mmBCFAs and is negatively regulated by TAT- 2 in intestinal cells. This work indicates a novel connection between a P-type ATPase and the critical regulatory function of a specific fatty acid...|$|R
