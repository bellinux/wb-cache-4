5|$|By the mid-1970s, Ike Turner's {{excessive}} cocaine habit {{had gotten}} out of hand. During this period, Tina adopted the Nichiren Buddhism faith and chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo to help her deal with a stressful marriage and career. Due to Ike Turner's drug abuse, some shows were either canceled or postponed. In July 1976, Ike Turner had plans to leave United Artists Records for a five-year, $150,000 deal with Cream Records. The deal was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>signed</b> on July 6. On July 1, 1976, Ike and Tina were en route from Los Angeles to Dallas where the Revue had a gig at the Dallas Statler Hilton. Ike and Tina got into a fight during their ride to the hotel. Shortly after arriving to the hotel, Tina fled from the hotel and later hid at a friend's house. On July 27, Tina sued for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.Ike claims in his book that Tina initiated the fight by purposely irritating him so that she'd have a reason to break up with him before they were scheduled to sign a new 5-year contract upon their return from Dallas.|$|E
5|$|On 22 July B Company, 2 RAR was {{relieved}} on The Hook by D Company, and subsequently moved into reserve. The following day, with the ceasefire {{believed to be}} imminent, Wilton limited patrols to only those considered essential {{for the security of}} his forward positions. Rumours spread quickly among the troops that the truce was expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>signed</b> on 26 July. However, by 24 July the Chinese shelling had once again grown in intensity, while large bodies of Chinese infantry were increasingly seen on the forward slopes by the Australians. Meanwhile, similar concentrations of Chinese were also reported by the US Marines. With the Chinese eager to gain a last-minute victory over the UN forces and the tactical advantage offered to the side that held The Hook after the truce, simultaneous attacks were soon launched against 2 RAR and the US 7th Marine Regiment on the left flank, in two major actions on the nights of 24/25 and 25/26 July.|$|E
5|$|Shah Rukh Khan was {{the first}} actor to be {{approached}} with the script and {{was the first}} lead actor <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>signed</b> for the film. Rohit Shetty stated that despite the title, Khan would not play a South Indian in the film. The casting of the lead heroine was the subject of much press speculation; Kareena Kapoor, Asin and Deepika Padukone were rumoured to be involved. Shetty denied those rumours, stating that the cast would be finalised in April 2012, and {{that he was going to}} cast an established actress in the role. In October 2012, it was confirmed that Deepika Padukone had been signed to play the female lead opposite Khan, and photographs showing Padukone and Khan shooting were released. This was Padukone's second film opposite Khan, with whom she made her Bollywood debut in the 2007 blockbuster Om Shanti Om. Starting with this film, which was released on Women's Day, Khan wished to have the name of his female co-star appear above his own in the credits.|$|E

5|$|The Court of King's Bench did {{act as an}} appellate body, hearing appeals {{from the}} Court of Common Pleas, eyre circuits, assize courts and local courts, but was not a court of last resort; its own records were sent to Parliament <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>signed</b> off on. The {{creation}} of the Court of Exchequer Chamber in 1585 created a court from which King's Bench decisions could be appealed to, and with {{the expansion of the}} Exchequer Chamber's jurisdiction in 1830 the King's Bench ceased to be an appellate court. Thanks to the Bill of Westminster and other legal fictions, the King's Bench gained much of the Common Pleas's jurisdiction, although the Common Pleas remained the sole place where real property claims could be brought.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the major}} record {{companies}} dominate the American music industry, an independent music industry (indie music) does exist. Most indie record labels have limited, if any, retail distribution outside a small region. Artists sometimes record for an indie label and gain enough acclaim <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>signed</b> {{to a major}} label; others choose to remain at an indie label for their entire careers. Indie music may be in styles generally similar to mainstream music, but is often inaccessible, unusual, or otherwise unappealing to many people. Indie musicians often release {{some or all of}} their songs over the Internet for fans and others to download and listen. In addition to recording artists of many kinds, there are numerous fields of professional musicianship in the United States, many of whom rarely record, including community orchestras, wedding singers and bands, lounge singers, and nightclub DJs. The American Federation of Musicians is the largest American labor union for professional musicians. However, only 15% of the Federation's members have steady music employment.|$|E
5|$|Twelve years later, the Kingsglaive {{fight to}} protect Lucis's borders from attacks by Niflheim's Magitek army and Daemons, unnatural monsters tamed for {{military}} use. During one such operation, Nyx Ulric defies his orders to withdraw to rescue his friend Libertus from a Daemon. Regis, whose magic powers the Wall and is growing weaker due to advancing age, accepts Imperial Chancellor Ardyn Izunia's offer of peace. This causes dissension among the Kingsglaive, who feel Regis is abandoning their families. Two {{days before the}} treaty is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>signed,</b> Kingsglaive member Crowe is sent {{on a mission to}} escort Lunafreya to Lucis, but is killed en route. Her death causes Libertus to leave the Kingsglaive and join a group of Lucian rebels. At a party dedicated to the signing of the treaty, attended by both Regis and Niflheim's emperor Iedolas Aldercapt, Lunafreya meets with Nyx before being secretly abducted by Glauca. Nyx discovers this and finds that Niflheim has stationed their army outside Insomnia.|$|E

5|$|Gouverneur Morris is credited, {{both now}} and then, {{as the chief}} {{draftsman}} of the final document, including the stirring preamble. Not all the delegates were pleased with the results; thirteen left before the ceremony, and three of those remaining refused to sign: Edmund Randolph of Virginia, George Mason of Virginia, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts. George Mason demanded a Bill of Rights if he was to support the Constitution. The Bill of Rights {{was not included in}} the Constitution submitted to the states for ratification, but many states ratified the Constitution with the understanding that a bill of rights would soon follow. Shortly before the document was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>signed,</b> Gorham proposed to lower the size of congressional districts from 40,000 to 30,000 citizens. A similar measure had been proposed earlier, and failed by one vote. George Washington spoke up here, making his only substantive contribution to the text of the Constitution in supporting this move. The Convention adopted it without further debate. Gorham would sign the document, although he had openly doubted whether the United States would remain a single, unified nation for more than 150 years. Ultimately, 39 of the original 55 delegates ended up signing, but it is likely that none were completely satisfied. Their views were summed up by Benjamin Franklin, who said, I confess that There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them.... I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may be able to make a better Constitution.... It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does; and I think it will astonish our enemies...|$|E
5|$|The Baltimore Beltway {{was first}} planned in 1949 by Baltimore County; the state {{eventually}} {{took over the}} project and it {{became part of the}} Interstate Highway System planned in 1956. The length of the route from MD 2 south of Baltimore clockwise to U.S. Route 40 (US40) northeast of the city opened in stages from 1955 to 1962, providing an Interstate bypass of Baltimore. It was the first beltway in the United States to be built as part of the Interstate Highway System. Plans were made to finish the remainder of the route, with a diversion to the Windlass Freeway and the Patapsco Freeway, opened in 1973, following the cancellation of a more outer route that was to partly follow what is today MD702 (Southeast Boulevard). The Outer Harbor Crossing over the Patapsco River, which was dedicated to Francis Scott Key, who wrote The Star-Spangled Banner, and its approaches were finished in 1977, completing the route around Baltimore. The approaches to the bridge were originally two lanes to accommodate a tunnel that was originally proposed to run under the river; in subsequent years, they were upgraded to a four-lane configuration compliant with Interstate Highway standards, allowing for this portion of route <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>signed</b> as I-695 rather than MD695. There are future plans for I-695 that include high-occupancy toll lanes to ease traffic. In addition, the northeastern interchange with I-95 has been reconstructed to accommodate express toll lanes that were added to I-95 (completed in 2014, but construction is in progress in 2016 to remove I-695's carriageway crossovers here).|$|E
