5|$|An {{animal that}} is {{commonly}} {{thought to be}} dazzle-patterned is the zebra. The bold stripes of the zebra have been claimed to be disruptive camouflage, background-blending and countershading. After many years in which {{the purpose of the}} coloration was disputed, an experimental study by Tim Caro suggested in 2012 that the pattern reduces the attractiveness of stationary models to biting flies such as horseflies and tsetse flies. However, a simulation study by Martin How and Johannes Zanker in 2014 suggests that when moving, the stripes may confuse observers, such as mammalian predators and biting insects, by two visual illusions: the wagon-wheel effect, where <b>the</b> <b>perceived</b> motion is inverted, and the barberpole illusion, where <b>the</b> <b>perceived</b> motion is in a wrong direction.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{population}} {{now appears to}} be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. <b>The</b> <b>perceived</b> decline {{may be due to the}} loss of invertebrate-rich pastures and mixed farms through conversion to arable agriculture or more intensively managed grassland. Adult survival, clutch size and fledging success are all lower in arable landscapes than in areas with extensive pasture. In Finland, the loss of ancient forests is thought to have led to a local decline.|$|E
5|$|Although this species' {{population}} {{now appears}} to be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria.

Eradication of rats protects seabird colonies and may enable recolonisation of islands cleared of rodents. Predation of cave-nesting petrels in the Balearics by yellow-legged gulls is restricted to relatively few individual gulls specialising in this prey item; this means that the problems can be controlled by selective culling and the provision of plastic nest boxes.|$|E
