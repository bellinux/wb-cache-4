40|$|Restriction of the {{distribution}} of Mesoclemmys vanderhaegei (Bour, 1973) (Testudines: Chelidae) in Argentina. The presence of the chelid turtle Mesoclemmys vanderhaegei in Argentina is currently restricted to some localities in Misiones, Corrientes and Formosa provinces. The only record for the last province was based in two specimens originally referred as M. vanderhaegei from the “Reserva Ecológica El Bagual”, which have been considered lost from the herpetological collection of the reserve. In a revision of the turtles at the herpetological collection of the Museo de La Plata both specimens were found. Both specimens, male and female, bear hypertrophied tubercles on the posterior face of the <b>thigh,</b> <b>supporting</b> that they actually correspond to Acanthochelys pallidipectoris.

30|$|The dial test, {{performed}} in prone and supine position, {{was described by}} Loomer in 1991 [81] and then modified by Veltri and Warren [82]. The patient lies in supine position with both <b>thighs</b> <b>supported</b> by a holder or is allowed to hang {{off the end of}} the examining table and stabilized by an assistant at 30 ° of knee flexion. The examiner externally rotates the lower legs and compares the tibial tuberosity external rotation side by side. In prone position an assistant is not needed, and the thigh–foot angle is measured. The test is positive for a PLC lesion if there is an increase of at least 10 – 15 ° in comparison with the other knee at 30 ° of knee flexion. The test is then performed at 90 ° of flexion; if a further increase in external rotation is present, a PCL lesion is associated.|$|R
50|$|Only {{small parts}} of {{the legs of the}} {{sculpture}} have remained. The small remaining piece of the left <b>thigh</b> <b>supports</b> a conclusion that the ruler was wearing fluted trousers. The fact that the trousers of Shapur I originally reached the ground is evident from the traces of folds encircling the original feet of the sculpture at irregular intervals. It stands to reason that the sculptor designed the length of the trousers not only for aesthetical reasons but also to increase the sculpture's stability. The long trousers would have functioned to enlarge contact area with the ground and to spread the stress of the colossal statue, which weighs several tonnes. The two feet of the sculpture are slightly spread. The left foot is lying a little ahead of the right foot. The original shoes of the colossal statue now have a contrasting conservation status. The right shoe is largely destroyed. The left shoe is virtually intact and has a round toe cap. The broad shoelaces, pleated lengthways, meander in an S-shape onto the ground.|$|R

The engine fitted was the 1.8-liter L18 engine paired to a four-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmission; Datsun upgraded the SSS to a five-speed manual in 1975. Over the base Deluxe, GL models added: vinyl roof, radio with separate speaker, upgraded interior upholstery and trim, cut-pile interior carpeting, chrome exhaust extension, rear mounted GL badge, and whitewall tyres. In early 1974, wrap-around front indicators, new tail-lights and cabin trim changes heralded a range-wide facelift, while a fully imported (not locally manufactured) luxury GX sedan arrived in November 1974.The GX model {{could only be}} differentiated on the exterior by its grille, wipers and badges, although the interior gained luxuries such as cloth inserts for the vinyl upholstery and a three-way adjustable driving seat (fore/aft, recline, <b>thigh</b> <b>support).</b> A GX wagon followed in June 1975, followed by a minor trim and grille facelift in 1976.

40|$|Abstract The {{effects of}} back angle and leg height on sitting {{forces in a}} {{wheelchair}} were studied, using a force plate mounted on a wheelchair seat. Readings of both normal force (perpen-dicular to the seat) and shear force were measured while the chair's back angle and footrest height were changed. Pressure under the ischial tuberosities was also measured during the footrest height adjustments. Five normal subjects sat directly on the plate as well as upon ROHO and Jay cushions placed on the force plate. Returning the back to the upright position after a recline caused the normal force (± SD) to increase 5. 4 ± 2. 5, 9. 5 ± 4. 0, and 10. 0 ± 2. 3 kg for the hard surface, Jay cushion, and ROHO cushion respectively, while shear at the plate increased to 5. 1 ± 2. 2, 11. 6 ± 2. 6, and 12. 3 ± 2. 7 kg for the hard surface, Jay cushion, and ROHO cushion respectively. Leaning forward (away from the back) caused all the forces to return to measurements close to the starting values. The {{results suggest that the}} wheelchair user should momentarily lean forward after a recline to reduce undesired forces. If a cushion with firm <b>thigh</b> <b>support</b> is used, ischial tuberosity pressure can be reduced by lowering the leg height as much as possible, which causes a levering action by lifting the pelvis.

30|$|To {{avoid this}} problem, Wroble and Lindenfeld [29] {{introduced}} the “stabilized Lachman test,” {{in which the}} patient’s <b>thigh</b> is <b>supported</b> on a bolster.

In 1995 [26], Draper and Schulthies described the “alternate Lachman test” as a modification of the “prone Lachman test” first introduced by Feagin [27]. They found that {{the sensitivity of the}} standard Lachman test was 28  %, that of the anterior drawer test was 59  %, while that of the alternate Lachman test was 78  % in subjects with large thigh girths (more than 43  cm).

40|$|A newly {{developed}} work seat for industrial sewing operations was {{compared with a}} traditional sewing work seat {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of design features. The new seat was designed with special seat-pan and backrest features to accommodate the musculoskeletal geometry of a low sit-stand posture. The seat-pan consisted of a pelvic support which supported the ischial tuberosities and areas behind them, and a <b>thigh</b> <b>support</b> which maintained the theghs at a 15 [deg] downward angle, resulting in a 105 [deg] trunk-thigh angle. The backrest consisted of a lumbar support which preserved lumbar lordosis and a thoracic support which supported the upper back during backward leaning. The traditional work seat was similar to an office chair (i e, a large horizontal seat-pan and a wide backrest) with the exception of having a higher than normal seat-height. This investigation consisted of three studies to compare the seats: (1) A user comfort and acceptance experiment which compared the initial psychophysical responses of 50 industrial sewers when introduced to the new seat; (2) a backrest usage experiment which compared the duration of backrest use among 10 industrial sewers; and (3) a follow-up experiment to evaluate chair preference after extended use of the new seat. The results of the user comfort and acceptance experiment found that the new work seat had greater comfort and user preference; the results of the backrest usage experiment found that the new seat had greater backrest use than the traditional seat; the results of the follow-up experiment found that the preference for the new seat was maintained over time and not due to a Hawthorne Effect...|$|E

40|$|Biodynamic {{responses}} of the seated human body are usually measured and modelled assuming a single point of vibration excitation. With vertical vibration excitation, this study investigated how forces are distributed over the body-seat interface. Vertical and fore-and-aft forces were measured beneath the ischial tuberosities, middle thighs, and front thighs of 14 subjects sitting on a rigid flat seat in three postures with different thigh contact while exposed to random vertical vibration at three magnitudes. Measures of apparent mass were calculated from transfer functions between the vertical acceleration of the seat and the vertical or fore-and-aft forces measured at the three locations, and the sum of these forces. When sitting normally or sitting with a high footrest, vertical forces at the ischial tuberosities dominated the vertical apparent mass. With feet unsupported to give increased thigh contact, vertical forces at the front thighs were dominant around 8 Hz. Around 3 - 7 Hz, fore-and-aft forces at the middle thighs dominated the fore-and-aft cross-axis apparent mass. Around 8 - 10 Hz, fore-and-aft forces were dominant at the ischial tuberosities with feet supported but at the front thighs with feet unsupported. All apparent masses were nonlinear: as the vibration magnitude increased the resonance frequencies decreased. With feet unsupported, the nonlinearity in the apparent mass was greater at the front thighs than at the ischial tuberosities. It is concluded that when the <b>thighs</b> are <b>supported</b> on a seat it is not appropriate to assume the body has a single point of vibration excitation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sperber, A; 1997. Articular Distension in Arthroscopy. An Experimental Study on Intra- and Extra {{articular}} Effects of Pressure ISBN 91 - 628 - 2414 - 7 The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to analyse the effects of various intra-articular pressures (IAP) on soft tissues and to provide guidelines for the choice of safe infusion pressures during arthroscopy. The tensile properties of the knee-joint capsule were recorded from stress-strain-relaxation tests within 170 mmHg IAP. During stepwise infusion, there was a linear increase in stiffness without signs of plastic deformation. The mean volume increase after 15 min of stress-relaxation was 7. 4 % which was attributed to capsular adaptation. Extra-articular fluid loss had little significance for the pressure fall during stress-relaxation. Short-term pressures below 170 mmH can be used during knee arthroscopy without harming the joint capsule The IAP in three different knee joint compartments was recorded during arthroscopy at 75 mmHg or 100 mmHg resting IAP. During a standardised ROM between 45 - 0 - 90 - 45 ° with and without external rotation of the lower leg, there were pressure peaks at 350 mmHg in flexion and extension in the 100 mmHg group. In all joints there was a pressure equiliblium between the anteromedial, posteromedial and suprapatellar compartments. Intra-articular flow obstruction during arthroscopy is not {{a risk factor for}} the development of a capsular rupture. Using the duplex ultrasound technique, the flow velocity, diameter and cross sectional area of the great saphenous vein and one of the postelior tibial veins of the lower leg were recorded during knee arthroscopy at 0, 100 and 180 mmHg IAP. At all pressure Ievels, recordings were made with the <b>thigh</b> <b>supported</b> and unsupported by a leg holder. Thigh compression caused a significant blood flow redistribution from the deep system to the superficial. system - an effect that was pronounced at 180 mmHg. The thigh should be compressed in tbe Ieg holder for as short periods as possible and the IAP should not be raised above 100 mmHg. The intramuscular pressure (IMP) of the supraspinatus and the deltoid muscles, and the intravascular absorption of ethano-labeled irrigation fluid, was recorded during arthroscopic acromioplasty at 100 or 150 mmHg of bursa fluid prcssure. The IMP in the subacromial procedure averaged 60 mmHg while pressure peaks were recorded at 120 mmHg IMP. Fluid absorption amounted to 100 ml in the 100 mmHg group and 37 ml in the 150 mHg group. Arthroscopic acromioplasty at 150 mmHg produces IMP levels that may affect the muscular blood flow, while the fluid absorption is negligeble. The capsular elasticity and joint volume in post-traumatic anteriorly unstable shoulders were measured from stress-strain infusion curves obtained from infusion at 100 ml/min during arthroscopy. In all patients, the contralateral stable shoulder was examined using the same technique. The capsular elasticity was the same in the stable and the unstable shoulder. The joint volume was 27 ml at 100 mmHg and 33 ml at 180 mmHg in the stable and the unstable shoulder in the same patient. Recurrent dislocation cause neither a pelmanent capsular distension nor an increased joint volume that maintains the instability.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to design an artificial shape and a function {{for use in the}} body. Designed shapes and functions sometimes ruin the surrounding tissue, because they disorder the adaptive self-remodeling of living tissue. For example, if a fractured <b>thigh</b> bone was <b>supported</b> by a rigid fracture plate for a long time, then the strength of the supported bone reduced gradually because of disuse bone atrophy. This thought to be an example that the function of thigh bone was ruined by artificially designed function. Our theme is "Bio-Environment Designing " which is thought to be the key concept for successful tissue-engineering treatment and advocates that the object of designing is not the biological functions but the environments. As living things show a proper shape and a function in proper environment, bio-environment setting has been commonly used in several fields such as agriculture and so on. On the other hand, function designing is a dominant concept of engineering where the function is analyzed and reconstructed in an optimized structure. Back-grounds for the bio-environment setting are rather teleological, but that for designing are mechanical. Fundamental methods for the "Bio-Environment Designing " are similar to that for the bio-environment setting, but do not based on only teleological arguments. So, before explaining concrete methodologies of the "Bio...|$|R
40|$|Seated human {{subjects}} {{have been exposed}} to vertical whole-body vibration so as to investigate the non-linearity in their biodynamic responses and quantify the response in directions other than the direction of excitation. Twelve males were exposed to random vertical vibration in the frequency range 0. 25 – 25 Hz at four vibration magnitudes (0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 625, and 1. 25 m s? 2 r. m. s.). The subjects sat in four sitting postures having varying foot heights so as to produce differing thigh contact with the seat (feet hanging, feet <b>supported</b> with maximum <b>thigh</b> contact, feet <b>supported</b> with average <b>thigh</b> contact, and feet <b>supported</b> with minimum <b>thigh</b> contact). Forces were measured in the vertical, fore-and-aft, and lateral directions on the seat and in the vertical direction at the footrest. The characteristic non-linear response of the human body with reducing resonance frequency at increasing vibration magnitudes was seen in all postures, but to a lesser extent with minimum thigh contact. Appreciable forces in the fore-and-aft direction also showed non-linearity, while forces in the lateral direction were low and showed no consistent trend. Forces at the feet were non-linear with a multi-resonant behaviour and were affected by the position of the legs. The decreased non-linearity with the minimum thigh contact posture suggests the tissues of the buttocks affect the non-linearity of the body more than the tissues of the thighs. The forces in the fore-and-aft direction are consistent with the body moving in two directions when exposed to vertical vibration. The non-linear behaviour of the body, and the considerable forces in the fore–aft direction should be taken into account when optimizing vibration isolation devices...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Opening wedge high tibial {{osteotomy}} (HTO) is {{an accepted}} treatment option for medial compartment knee osteoarthritis with associated varus lower limb axis in younger, more active patients. A {{concern with the}} use of this technique is that posterior tibial slope (PTS) and tibial rotation can be altered. We hypothesized that {{there is a tendency to}} increase the PTS and internal rotation of the distal tibia during the procedure and that certain intra-operative parameters may influence the amount of change that can be expected. Methods A cadaveric model and surgical navigation system were used to evaluate the influence of certain intra-operative factors of the degree of PTS and tibial rotation change observed during medial opening HTO. Parameters evaluated included: degree of osteotomy opening, knee flexion angle, location of limb <b>support</b> (<b>thigh</b> versus foot), performance of a posteromedial release, the status of the lateral cortical hinge, and the degree of osteoarthritis present in the knee. Results Combining measurements of all specimens and parameters, a mean PTS increase of 2. 7 ° ± 3. 9 ° and a mean tibial internal rotation of 1. 5 ° ± 2. 9 ° were observed. Clinically, significant changes in tibial slope (> 2 °) occurred in 50. 4 % of corrections, while significant changes in tibial rotation (> 5 °) occurred in only 11. 9 % of corrections. Patients with significant osteoarthritis and concomitant flexion contracture, cases where large corrections were required, and procedures in which the lateral cortical hinge was disrupted were associated with increased PTS change. The other factors evaluated did not exert a significant influence of the degree of PTS change observed. Conclusions Surgeons should be vigilant for possible PTS change, particularly in high-risk situations as outlined above. Routine use of an intra-operative measure of PTS is recommended to avoid inadvertent slope change...|$|R
40|$|Seated {{subjects}} {{have participated}} in two experiments with fore-and-aft whole-body vibration to investigate dynamic responses at the seat and footrest {{in the direction of}} vibration and in other directions. In the first experiment, 12 males were exposed to fore-and-aft random vibration (0. 25 – 20 Hz) at four magnitudes (0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 625, and 1. 25 m s? 2 rms) while sitting on a seat with no backrest in four postures with varying foot heights to produce differing thigh contact with the seat (feet hanging, feet <b>supported</b> with maximum <b>thigh</b> contact, feet <b>supported</b> with average <b>thigh</b> contact, and feet <b>supported</b> with minimum <b>thigh</b> contact). In the second experiment, six subjects were exposed to three vibration magnitudes (0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 625 m s? 2 rms) in the average thigh contact posture, both with and without a rigid backrest. Forces were measured in the vertical, fore-and-aft, and lateral directions on the supporting seat surface (in the first experiment) and in the fore-and-aft and vertical directions at the footrest (in the second experiment). On the seat, there were three vibration modes in the fore-and-aft apparent mass on the seat at frequencies below 10 Hz in all postures (around 1 Hz, between 1 and 3 Hz, and between 3 and 5 Hz); large vertical forces were dependent on foot support while lateral forces were relatively small. At the feet, the fore-and-aft apparent mass showed a resonance between 3 and 5 Hz, which increased in frequency and magnitude when a backrest was used. The fore-and-aft vibration produced high vertical forces at the footrest. At frequencies below resonance, the backrest reduced vertical and fore-and-aft forces at the footrest. On the seat and the footrest, the forces showed a nonlinear characteristic that varied between postures. The presence of appreciable vertical forces indicate that during fore-and-aft excitation the body moved in two dimensions. It is concluded that forces in directions other than the direction of excitation should be taken into account when considering biodynamic responses to fore-and-aft whole-body vibration...|$|R
40|$|Background: There {{is a high}} {{prevalence}} of injury and low back pain prevalence associated with professional drivers, including mobile police officers. In particular, the reduction in lumbar lordosis has been hypothesized as a contributing risk factor for injury during prolonged seated periods. Furthermore, {{the use of the}} mobile data terminal (MDT) and the protective equipment worn by officers creates a unique interface between the occupant and the car seat. Purpose: To evaluate a novel thoracic support that was designed to address the unique seated working demands of mobile police officers. Methods: Fourteen participants: 7 male (21. 3 (1. 9) years, 1. 71 (0. 06) m, 75. 1 (9. 3) kg) and 7 female (23. 3 (4. 4) years, 1. 69 (0. 06) m, 68. 2 (7. 7) kg) were recruited from a university student population. Participants attended two 120 minute driving simulations on separate days; using a standard Crown Victoria Interceptor seat and the same seat equipped with a retrofitted surface mounted thoracic support. Time-varying spine postures, seat pressure measures and perceived discomfort were measured. Results: The introduction of a thoracic support changed postures, reduced lower seat back interface pressures but did not reduce discomfort compared to a standard seat during a 2 hour exposure period. Average discomfort scores were low with all values below 10 mm out of a possible 100 mm for both seating conditions. Discomfort was found to have small increases over time in the neck and right <b>thigh</b> with the <b>support,</b> but mean values remained low (under 3 mm). Lumbar angles became more flexed with the support compared to a standard seat. Posterior pelvic rotation was reduced in female participants while in males there was greater posterior pelvic rotation with the support. There was a reduction in interface pressures on {{the bottom half of the}} seat back, the area where the duty belt is in contact with the seat. Conclusions: The postural and seat interface information support further field evaluations using a retrofitted thoracic insert as an in-vehicle ergonomic intervention for police officers. Further investigations focussed on prolonged exposure to the intervention will guide future design iterations...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Bodybuilders {{and fitness}} {{competitors}} are aiming to reduce fat mass and maintain lean mass during the competition phase. Low carbohydrate diets compared to low fat diets have {{claimed to be}} more effective in weight loss, but the results are still controversial. Low carbohydrate intake and high protein intake have been reported in bodybuilders during the diet, but the evidence of its effectiveness is limited. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of carbohydrate content on body composition during weight loss in female fitness competitors. Methods. A total of 50 female subjects participated in this study, 27 were competitors, and 23 were weight training stable controls. Twelve of the competitors were followed with relatively low carbohydrate (LC) to high carbohydrate (HC) diets. The HC group included six subjects (mean ± SD; age 27. 5 ± 4. 4 y, weight 64. 8 ± 4. 4 kg, and height 1. 65 ± 0. 03 m), whose carbohydrate intake during the weight loss was set > 145 g/d, and the proportion from the energy less than 7 % decrease from the baseline. The LC group included six subjects (mean ± SD; age 29 ± 3. 3 y, weight 63. 9 ± 7. 7 kg and height 1. 64 ± 0. 06 m), and the values for carbohydrate intake during weight loss was < 120 g/d, and the proportion from the energy at least 10 % decrease from the baseline. Nutritional data was analyzed based on the food diaries by nutrient analysis software (Aivodiet, Flow-team Oy, Oulu, Finland). The body composition was measured at two time points, before the diet and the day after the competition. The body composition was measured by both InBody bioimpedance and Dual Energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Muscle cross sectional area of vastus lateralis (VL) muscle and thickness of triceps brachii (TB) muscle was measured using ultrasound. The energy expenditure was calculated by activity diaries as MET-hours and training frequency. Results. The energy intake was significantly lower in the LC group than in the HC group during the diet (P= 0. 002), similarly the absolute carbohydrate intake (P= 0. 001), per kg body weight (P= 0. 002) and relative (P= 0. 02) was lower in LC. Protein intake was absolutely (P= 0. 03) and per kg body weight (P= 0. 04) lower in the LC group. Fat intake decreased slightly in both groups, but the relative intake decreased only in LC (P= 0. 05). Fat mass decreased in both groups as measured with all methods, but the loss was not significant between the groups. Fat in VL decreased more in the HC group (P= 0. 006) compared to the LC group (P= 0. 05), but was not significant between the groups (P= 0. 47). No significant change between the groups in fat or thickness of TB was observed. The VL CSA decreased in the LC group by 2. 8 cm 2 (P= 0. 023) and increased in the HC group by 0. 9 cm 2 (P= 0. 25), but the VL CSA was greater in the LC group at the baseline (P= 0. 005). Lean mass slightly increased during the diet in both groups when measured by DXA, but LBM remained unchanged, when measured by InBody bioimpedance. Conclusion. The main finding of the study was that there were no consistent effects between the low and high CHO groups in the body composition and muscle or fat size changes. However, there were few differences between the groups. Fat mass decreased in both groups, but the VL CSA decreased only in the LC group compared to the HC group who even managed slightly to increase muscle size in front <b>thighs.</b> The findings <b>support</b> the fact that the energy deficit is the most important thing in weight loss rather than macronutrient content. It might be that normal carbohydrate with high protein intake would provide better outcomes in weight loss in female fitness competitors, for sparing muscle size at least in thighs, but the future investigation is needed...|$|R
