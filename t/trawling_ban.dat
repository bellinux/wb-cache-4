40|$|The Malindi-Ungwana Bay fishery Kenya {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} marine fisheries of the Western Indian Ocean. There are two fishing grounds: Formosa and Malindi, with a designated 5 -nMno-trawl zone offshore. However, the fishery was faced with numerous resource use conflicts and a decline in catches, culminating in a <b>trawl</b> <b>ban</b> in 2006. This study analyses catches and fishery dynamics before and after the 2006 <b>trawl</b> <b>ban.</b> Results show that artisanal landings declined before the ban, but rapidly recovered within 2 years after the ban was imposed. However, shrimp landings in the artisanal fishery remain low. Commercial shrimp landings gradually declined before the ban: similar to 550 t in 2001 to 250 t in 2006, and the shrimp: fish bycatch ratio was 1 : 1. 5 compared to early reports of 1 : 7 in 1999. SIMPER analyses shows that 6 and 16 families (groups) accounted for 91. 0 and 90. 2 % of the similarity in catch within the Formosa and Malindi fishing grounds, respectively. Formosa was important for Claridae, Cichlidae and Protopteridae, while Malindi recorded Carangidae, Siganidae, Carcharhinidae and Lethrinidae as the main families.

Comparisons were made for three size classes of hake encompassing 60 to 410 mm total length. Fish were collected from 50 to 200 m depth on muddy bottoms. The diets of hake of small and medium size were similar overall but more selective in the untrawled gulf. Greater differences were detected between the diets of larger specimens from trawled and untrawled areas. In the untrawled gulf large hake mainly preyed on clupeoid fish, while in the trawled gulfs other fish prey were found in the stomach contents. Î´ 15 N values of hake did not vary significantly between trawled and untrawled areas, while there was a clear effect of size, with larger individuals being significantly more enriched than juveniles. Conversely, Î´ 13 C values were generally more depleted for individuals collected in the untrawled area, suggesting a more pelagic source of carbon.

Using a stochastic frontier analysis, this study demonstrates that engine power, household size and operating characteristics of vessels strongly affect technical efficiency.

Despite the <b>ban</b> on <b>trawling,</b> the vessels operating {{in the vicinity of the}} MPA are still more technically efficient than those operating in an alternative unprotected area.

40|$|Since June 2010 the Italian {{government}} {{prohibited the}} trawling activity within three nautical {{miles from the}} coast or within the 50 m isobath. This decision was {{expected to have a}} great impact on trawl fishing activities, but at the moment no real assessment of the effects on catches and possible ecological implications has been undertaken. In order to fill this gap, an assessment on the North Western Adriatic Sea coast has been performed. Landings per Unit of Effort (kilograms per boat per day) for each trawling fleet segment have been analysed, by comparing on a monthly basis the before (2007 - 2009) and after ban (2011 - 2013) period. The comparison was carried out considering total landings and the six main species targeted inside the three miles area (sand smelt, cuttlefish, red mullet, sole, turbot, and mantis shrimp). Within a general reduction of total landings, a differential effect based on the analysed metiers was detected, with small trawlers being more negatively affected than the large and rapido ones, which showed, for some species, positive impacts. From an ecological point of view, though, no positive overall effects were detected, probably {{due to the fact that}} the adopted measure is not sufficient to reduce the overexploitation.

40|$|Trawling is {{a widely}} {{employed}} fishing method worldwide, but it can destructively damage the benthic ecosystem, non-selectively collect animals of all sizes, and lead to overfishing. To promote sustainable fishery, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region implemented a <b>trawling</b> <b>ban</b> within Hong Kongâ€™s territorial waters on 31 th December 2012. As this policy intervention can lower the impact to marine benthic habitats that were formerly brought by trawling activities, gradual recoveries of these habitats and their associated fisheries resources are to be expected. This study, aimed {{to test the hypothesis}} that the trawl-ban would lead to a recovery of the benthic molluscan community in Hong Kong waters in terms of their species richness, species composition and food web structure. Systematic trawl surveys were conducted between 2012 (pre trawl-ban) and 2014 (post trawl-ban) while temporal comparison was also made by contrasting these survey results with those reported in the available literature dated back to the 1970 s. The composition of mollusc communities within Hong Kong waters shown significant changes over the decades. The mollusc community in the 1980 s was once dominated by scavenger and pollution-tolerant species, but their populations notably declined in 2014. Their declines can be regarded as a sign of ecosystem recovery, despite the abundance of commercially important molluscan species remained low. This temporal trend implies that the Governmentâ€™s environmental policies such as measures for water quality improvement and the trawl-ban may have led to some slight improvements in the benthic ecosystem. For the surveys between 2012 and 2014, there were obviously spatial, seasonal and temporal variations in diversity and biomass of molluscs. Generally, the diversity indices were low in 2012, increased throughthe 2013 wet season tothe 2014 wet season but declined again inthe 2014 dry season. The results also suggested that marine pollution (e. g. eutrophication, red tides and hypoxia) possibly played a role in shaping the mollusc community in addition to the influence of the trawl-ban. Furthermore, massive blooms of species, such as the sea urchin Temnopleurus reevesi and starfish Archaster typicus, were encountered during the survey. These blooming of these species could outcompete the molluscs and other benthic species, leading to a change in community structure. Stable isotope analysis was applied to study the trophic dynamics among the six mollusc communities in Hong Kong, between wet and dry seasons, between 2012 (pre-trawl-ban) and 2014 (post-trawl-ban). Although the results were highly seasonally dependent, there were some positive post trawl-ban changes in terms of food web structure of the mollusc community at Southern Lantau and Po Toi areas, indicating some signs of ecosystem recovery. However, the other sites within and nearby Tolo area did not show any improvement. Therefore, the recovery is likely remained to be a slow process. A lack of clear improvement might due to continued impacts from other anthropogenic activities, including illegal trawling, eutrophication (i. e., harmful algal blooms) and suboptimal water quality. Without addressing these anthropogenic impacts, a full recovery of the benthic ecosystems and their associated fishery resources remains uncertain. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|Oral PresentationConference Theme: Ecological Sustainability: Engineering ChangeHong Kongâ€™s {{government}} imposed {{an indefinite}} territory-wide <b>ban</b> on <b>trawl</b> fishing in December 2012 {{in an attempt}} to facilitate ecosystem and fisheries recovery. Understanding if and to what extent recovery is proceeding is a challenge that is further complicated by spatial diversity of habitats from estuarine to oceanic, and strong monsoon seasonality. As such, Hong Kong has high marine biodiversity that suggests spatially variable recovery responses, and strong migratory patterns that infer recovery will not simply be a response to localised reductions in fishing mortality. We focus on examining benthic fish communities using year-long monthly trawl survey data at twelve sites. Detecting early-stage recovery within benthic habitats will require identifying suitable ecological indicators, and here we focus on two levels of organisation: i) at a community level by examining food web structure (using stable isotope approaches) and ii) at the species level by identifying resident species (based on phenological patterns) and trawl-sensitive species (based on a maximum size index). Isotopic proxy measures of food web structure show strong seasonal and spatial differences in trophic structure that infers a need to account for site and season specific recovery, and allows identification of appropriate food web indicators to examine recovery. At a species level, quantifying proportion of community composed of resident and trawl-sensitive species infers what proportion of species will likely benefit from a localised <b>trawl</b> <b>ban</b> and thus what recovery might look like, while providing an appropriate baseline indicator of community composition against which to assess future recovery. Given the scarcity of <b>trawl</b> <b>bans</b> globally, and the context of high diversity and migratory patterns, we discuss our approaches to identifying effective ecological recovery indicators and the key insights this study provides into the likely effectiveness of a localised resource management policy within a larger region of high exploitation...|$|R
