5|$|A {{series of}} biotic and abiotic cues, such as {{individual}} genetics, foraging quantity and quality, or population density, may trigger the maturation of the reproductive organs {{and the production}} of gametes and thus determine sexual maturity.

5|$|An ancient {{solution}} to a flow problem is a curve whose evolution can be extrapolated backwards for all time, without singularities. All of the self-similar solutions that shrink or stay <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>size</b> rather than growing are ancient solutions in this sense; they can be extrapolated backwards by reversing the self-similarity transformation that they would undergo by the forwards curve-shortening flow. Thus, for instance, the circle, grim reaper, and Abresch–Langer curves are all ancient solutions.|$|E

5|$|Chickenpox was {{commonly}} {{confused with}} smallpox {{in the immediate}} post-eradication era. Chickenpox and smallpox can be distinguished by several methods. Unlike smallpox, chickenpox does not usually affect the palms and soles. Additionally, chickenpox pustules are of varying size due to variations in the timing of pustule eruption: smallpox pustules are all very nearly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>size</b> since the viral effect progresses more uniformly. A variety of laboratory methods are available for detecting chickenpox in evaluation of suspected smallpox cases.|$|E

Estimates of rate of occurrence of short-duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation, but are probably comparable.|$|E
5|$|Fossil (or subfossil) black {{vultures}} cannot {{necessarily be}} attributed to the Pleistocene or the recent species without further information: <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>size</b> variation found in the living bird was also present in its larger prehistoric relative. Thus, in 1968, Hildegarde Howard separated the Mexican birds as Coragyps occidentalis mexicanus as opposed to the birds from locations farther north (such as Rancho La Brea) which constituted the nominate subspecies C. o. occidentalis. The southern birds were of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>size</b> as present-day north black vultures and can only be distinguished by their somewhat stouter tarsometatarsus and the flatter and wider bills, and even then only with any certainty if the location where the fossils were found is known. As the Pleistocene and current black vultures form an evolutionary continuum rather than splitting into two or more lineages, some include the Pleistocene taxa in C. atratus.|$|E
