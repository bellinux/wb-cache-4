25|$|The Turkic runiform scripts, {{unlike other}} typologically close scripts of <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>do</b> {{not have a}} uniform palaeography as, for example, have the Gothic runes, noted for the {{exceptional}} uniformity of its language and paleography. The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, {{the best known of}} them is the Orkhon version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the Göktürks from the 8th century to record the Old Turkic language. It was later used by the Uyghur Empire; a Yenisei variant is known from 9th-century Kyrgyz inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the Talas Valley of Turkestan and the Old Hungarian script of the 10th century.|$|E

The site has a rich biodiversity. Nowhere else in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>do</b> 37% of Socotra's 825 plants, 90% of its reptiles and 95% of its snails occur. It is home to 192 bird species, 253 species of coral, 730 species of coastal fish, and 300 species of crab and lobster, {{as well as a}} range of Aloes and the Dragon's Blood Tree (Dracaena cinnabari). The cultural heritage of Socotra includes the unique Soqotri language.|$|E

25|$|As the {{combustion}} flue gas exits the boiler it is routed through a rotating flat basket of metal mesh which picks up heat and returns it to incoming fresh air as the basket rotates. This {{is called the}} air preheater. The gas exiting the boiler is laden with fly ash, which are tiny spherical ash particles. The flue gas contains nitrogen along with combustion products carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. The fly ash is removed by fabric bag filters or electrostatic precipitators. Once removed, the fly ash byproduct can sometimes {{be used in the}} manufacturing of concrete. This cleaning up of flue gases, however, only occurs in plants that are fitted with the appropriate technology. Still, the majority of coal-fired power stations in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>do</b> not have these facilities. Legislation in Europe has been efficient to reduce flue gas pollution. Japan has been using flue gas cleaning technology for over 30 years and the US has been doing the same for over 25 years. China is now beginning to grapple with the pollution caused by coal-fired power stations.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, when Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta {{outlined}} {{a plan to}} withdraw U.S. combat troops by 2013 if possible, Romney criticized the announcement, saying, [...] "Why in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>do</b> {{you go to the}} people that you’re fighting with and tell them the date you’re pulling out your troops?" [...] Romney's 2012 presidential election campaign website similarly criticized the Obama Administration for announcing a timetable for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, and reiterated his position that in a Romney presidency, decisions about when to withdraw troops would be made based on the advice of commanders in the field, not electoral politics.|$|E

[...] Despite kissing being wide spread, in some parts of the world it still is taboo to kiss publicly and is often banned in films or in other media.|$|E
2500|$|B finally {{discusses}} {{the idea of}} salvation and the organized institutions in the Taker society that he calls [...] "salvationist religions." [...] He states that humans only {{began to think that}} they needed saving from humanity (i.e. themselves) because of the historical evolution of war, famine, etc., that resulted from totalitarian agriculture. The need for salvation by a , he argues, like civilization and war, is not inherent to humanity but is a condition created by any human society, such as our own global one, that violates the Law of Life i.e. by practicing totalitarian agriculture. B asserts that humanity and <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>do</b> not need spiritual salvation, but, rather, that members of our one particular type of culture need to change their minds and actions if the human species is to survive in the world.|$|E

2500|$|Gramsci, {{like the}} early Marx, was an {{emphatic}} proponent of historicism. In Gramsci's view, all meaning {{derives from the}} relation between human practical activity (or [...] "praxis") and the [...] "objective" [...] historical and social processes {{of which it is}} a part. Ideas cannot be understood outside their social and historical context, apart from their function and origin. The concepts by which we organise our knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>do</b> not derive primarily from our relation to things (to an objective reality), but rather from the social relations (economic, for Marx) between the bearers of those concepts. As a result, {{there is no such thing}} as an unchanging [...] "human nature". Furthermore, philosophy and science do not [...] "reflect" [...] a reality independent of man. Rather, a theory can be said to be [...] "true" [...] when, in any given historical situation, it expresses the real developmental trend of that situation.|$|E
2500|$|Solar {{cells have}} a great {{potential}} to help rural electrification. [...] An estimated two million villages near the equator have limited access to electricity and fossil fuels and that approximately 25% of people in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>do</b> {{not have access to}} electricity. [...] When the cost of extending power grids, running rural electricity and using diesel generators is compared with the cost of solar cells, many times the solar cells win. [...] If the efficiency and cost of the current solar cell technology is decreased even further, then many rural communities and villages around the world could obtain electricity when current methods are out of the question. [...] Specific applications for rural communities would be water pumping systems, residential electric supply and street lights. [...] A particularly interesting application would be for health systems in countries where motorized vehicles are not overly abundant. [...] Solar cells could be used to provide the power to refrigerate medications in coolers during transport.|$|E
