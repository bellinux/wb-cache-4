Patch Brown had replaced Henwood, but due to stylistic differences during recording, he was replaced in turn by Jason Slack, a Slippery Rock Graduate. Tim Cashmere of Undercover felt that [...] "they are just as powerful as before" [...] with McLeod [...] "singing better than ever over her chunkier-than-ever riffs." [...] MediaSearch's Carmine Pascuzzi cautioned that [...] "Those who have been ready to write them off should rethink as Sarah McLeod sings beautifully and the band work in harness efficiently to produce a strong effort.

2500|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Eduardo Rivadavia, editor for AllMusic, criticized the album for using more modern commercial conventions and heavy use of synthesizers and keyboards {{in an attempt}} to reinvent the band's style. Rivadavia specifically pointed out [...] "Somebody Put Something in My Drink" [...] which he wrote [...] "wastes an aggressive vocal performance from Joey Ramone by supporting it with a shamelessly polished synthesizer backing track." [...] He goes on to call [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] "unbearably soft," [...] summing up that the album was a [...] "career low," [...] while he still rated the album three out of five stars. Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "B+" [...] deemed both [...] "She Belongs to Me" [...] and [...] "Crummy Stuff" [...] to be [...] "defensive-sounding" [...] but called [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] an anthem, while also praising [...] "My Head Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg)." [...] Rolling Stone critic David Fricke called the album a [...] "reductionist masterpiece" [...] that [...] "proves <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot more to give," [...] claiming it to rival previous albums Leave Home and Rocket to Russia.|$|E

60|$|Perhaps some individuals, {{who have}} had some {{collision}} with their trustees or committee, will ask me if I mean, that a teacher ought to be entirely and immediately under the supervision {{and control of the}} trustees, just as a mechanic is when employed by another man. By no means. There are various circumstances connected with the nature of this employment; the impossibility of the employers fully understanding it in all its details; and the character and the standing of the teacher himself, which always will, in matter of fact, prevent this. The employers always will, in a great many respects, place more confidence in the teacher and in his views, than they will in their own. But still, the ultimate power is theirs. Even if they err,--if they wish to have a course pursued which is manifestly inexpedient and wrong, <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> right to decide. It is their work: it is going on at their instance, and at their expense, and the power of ultimate decision, on all disputed questions, must, from {{the very nature of the}} case, rest with them. The teacher may, it is true, have his option either to comply with their wishes or to seek employment in another sphere; but while he remains in the employ of any persons, whether in teaching or in any other service, he is bound to yield to the wishes of his employers, when they insist upon it, and to submit pleasantly to their direction, when they shall claim their undoubted right to direct.|$|E

6000|$|It is by {{the mines}} and {{fisheries}} (of both of which I shall speak particularly in another place) that Cornwall is compensated for a soil, too barren {{in many parts of}} the county, to be ever well cultivated except at such an expenditure of capital as no mere farmer can afford. From the inexhaustible mineral treasures in the earth, and from the equally inexhaustible shoals of pilchards which annually visit the coast, the working population of Cornwall derive their regular means of support, where agriculture would fail them. At the mines, the regular rate of wages is from forty to fifty shillings a month; but miners have opportunities of making more than this. By what is termed [...] "working on tribute," [...] that is, agreeing to excavate the mineral lodes for a per centage on the value of the metal they raise, some of them have been known to make as much as six and even ten pounds each, in a month. When they are unlucky in their working speculations, or perhaps thrown out of employment altogether by the shutting up of a mine, <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fair opportunity of obtaining farm labour, which is paid for (out of harvest time) at the rate of nine shillings a week. But this is a resource of which they are rarely obliged to take advantage. A plot of common ground is included with the cottages that are let to them; and the cultivation of this, helps to keep them and their families, in bad times, until they find an opportunity of resuming work; when they may perhaps make as much in one month, as an agricultural labourer can in twelve.|$|E
