However, Mahlon Sands {{and his family}} stayed in England and travelled among European countries. They also visited the United States annually and were there for an extended visit from 1877 to 1879. <b>They</b> <b>kept</b> their house in Newport, Rhode Island throughout this time.|$|E
5|$|The Duke and Duchess {{effectively}} took on {{the role}} of celebrities and were regarded as part of café society in the 1950s and 1960s. They hosted parties and shuttled between Paris and New York; Gore Vidal, who met the Windsors socially, reported on the vacuity of the Duke's conversation. The couple doted on the pug dogs <b>they</b> <b>kept.</b>|$|E

5|$|By 1 March, the {{withdrawal}} was complete. His forces were mostly intact, but the fighting had been fierce: his Shield and Sword counter-attacks alone had cost him some 10,000–12,000 men. These counter-attacks usually failed to recover ground, but <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> the Red Army off-balance and won Model time {{to pull his}} units back. They also allowed him to say to Hitler that he was pursuing an aggressive approach, even as the front moved steadily to the west.|$|E

He suffered a heart attack later that year. In the 1950s he supported Joseph McCarthy in his crusade to root out Communists in Hollywood and Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, the Bedouin {{tracked the}} ancestry of each horse through an oral tradition. Horses of the purest blood {{were known as}} Asil and {{crossbreeding}} with non-Asil horses was forbidden. Mares were the most valued, both for riding and breeding, and pedigree families were traced through the female line. The Bedouin {{did not believe in}} gelding male horses, and considered stallions too intractable to be good war horses, thus <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> very few colts, selling most, and culling those of poor quality.|$|E

5|$|Hiryū {{reinforced}} the CAP with launches of 3 more Zeros at 08:25. These fresh Zeros helped defeat the next American air strike from Midway, 11 Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers from VMSB-241, which attacked the battleship Haruna starting around 08:30. Haruna escaped damage and 3 of the Vindicators were shot down. Although all the American air strikes had thus far caused negligible damage, <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> the Japanese carrier forces off-balance as Nagumo endeavored {{to prepare a}} response to news, received at 08:20, of the sighting of American carrier forces to his northeast.|$|E
5|$|Raynald {{accompanied}} Baldwin to Antioch in 1151 {{and settled}} in the principality, according to Steven Runciman. It is certain that Raynald fought in Baldwin's army during the Siege of Ascalon in early 1153. He may have already been engaged to Constance of Antioch (as Runciman suggests), or their betrothal took place during Raynald's visit to the principality {{before the end of}} the siege (as Malcolm Barber proposes). <b>They</b> <b>kept</b> their betrothal a secret until Baldwin gave his permission to their marriage.|$|E
5|$|The CAP {{defeated}} the next American air strike from Midway, shooting down {{three of the}} eleven Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers from VMSB-241, which attacked the battleship Haruna unsuccessfully, starting at around 08:30.

Around 08:30 Sōryū launched one of her D4Ys {{on a mission to}} confirm the location of the American carriers.|$|E

They {{received}} murderous {{fire from the}} 99th Pennsylvania and Hazlett's battery on Little Round Top, but <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> pushing forward. Capt. Smith's New York battery was under severe pressure from three sides, but its supporting infantry regiments were suffering severe casualties and could not protect it. Three 10-pound Parrott rifles were lost to the 1st Texas, and they were used against Union troops the next day.|$|E
5|$|Angband (1990) was {{developed}} by Alex Cutler and Andy Astrand while attending the University of Warwick. Having played UMoria, they wanted to expand the game even further. Working from UMorias code, they {{increased the number of}} levels and monsters, flavored the game based on Angband, the massive fortress controlled by Morgoth from Tolkien's fiction, and incorporated more of the deadlier creatures described within the Middle Earth mythology. <b>They</b> <b>kept</b> the Balrog as a difficult creature that must be overcome at a mid-game level, while Morgoth became the final boss the player must defeat to win the game. Following Cutler and Astrand's graduation, Sean March and Geoff Hill took over the development to see the game through to a public release outside of the university, adding in elements such as giving the player a sense of the rewards and dangers of a level when they entered it the first time.|$|E
5|$|Before 1600, a major {{war broke}} out in eastern North America among Native Americans; it was later called the Beaver Wars. Five American Indian Iroquois tribes confederated to battle against their neighbors. The Iroquois were opposed by a {{confederation}} of primarily Algonquian tribes including the Shawnee, Miami, Wea, Pottawatomie, and the Illinois. These tribes were significantly less advanced than the Mississippian culture that had preceded them. The tribes were semi-nomadic, used stone tools rather than copper, and did not create the large-scale construction and farming works of their Mississippian predecessors. The war continued with sporadic fighting {{for at least a}} century as the Iroquois sought to dominate the expanding fur trade with the Europeans. They achieved this goal for several decades. During the war, the Iroquois drove the tribes from the Ohio Valley to the south and west. <b>They</b> <b>kept</b> control of the area for hunting grounds.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{their failure}} to score any hits, the American torpedo attacks {{achieved}} three important results. First, <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> the Japanese carriers off balance and unable to prepare and launch their own counterstrike. Second, the poor control of the Japanese combat air patrol (CAP) meant {{they were out of}} position for subsequent attacks. Third, many of the Zeros ran low on ammunition and fuel. The appearance of a third torpedo plane attack from the southeast by VT-3 from Yorktown at 10:00 very quickly drew the majority of the Japanese CAP to the southeast quadrant of the fleet. Better discipline, and the employment of a greater number of Zeroes for the CAP might have enabled Nagumo to prevent (or at least mitigate) the damage caused by the coming American attacks.|$|E
5|$|Destruction Derby is a {{vehicular}} combat racing {{video game}} developed by Reflections Interactive {{and published by}} Psygnosis. Based on the sport of demolition derby, the game tasks the player with racing and destroying cars to score points. The developers implemented simulated physics to make the results of collisions easier to predict, and <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> the game's tracks small {{to increase the number}} of wrecks. Versions of Destruction Derby were released for MS-DOS, PlayStation and Sega Saturn. A Nintendo 64 version, Destruction Derby 64, was released in 1999 by Looking Glass Studios and THQ. Critics found Destruction Derby enjoyable and they praised its graphics and car damage system, but the Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn releases received mixed reviews. It doesn't work fully on all PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 models due to game save file issues. The game started the Destruction Derby franchise, beginning with its 1996 sequel, Destruction Derby 2.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the large}} {{interest}} in the group, the Herberts quickly set about creating a binding contract for them. Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the showcase, all five members delayed signing contracts on the legal advice from, amongst others, Victoria Beckham's father, Anthony Adams. In March 1995, because of the group's frustration at their management's unwillingness {{to listen to their}} visions and ideas, they parted from Heart Management. In order to ensure <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> control of their own work, the group retrieved the master recordings of their discography from the management offices. The next week they were supposed to meet with Sheffield-based producer Eliot Kennedy. The Herberts arranged the session weeks before the group's departure.|$|E

5|$|Due to the missed field goal, Air Force {{took over}} from {{the point at which}} the kick was missed, the 27-yard line. Despite gaining a bit of {{momentum}} when <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> Virginia Tech from scoring, the Falcons were unable to gain a first down and went three and out, punting the ball away. Tech declined to return the ball, which rolled to the Virginia Tech three-yard line, where the Hokies' offense took over. On the first play after the punt, Tech's Nigel Bowe fumbled the ball, which was leapt upon by several Air Force defenders, who recovered it. After the fumble recovery, it took the Falcons just one play to score a touchdown and gain a 107 lead.|$|E
5|$|Early {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} outrigger canoes from southern Borneo. Upon arrival, early settlers practiced slash-and-burn agriculture {{to clear the}} coastal rainforests for cultivation. The first settlers encountered Madagascar's abundance of megafauna, including giant lemurs, elephant birds, giant fossa and the Malagasy hippopotamus, which have since become extinct due to hunting and habitat destruction. By 600AD groups of these early settlers had begun clearing the forests of the central highlands. Arab traders first reached the island between the seventh and ninth centuries. A wave of Bantu-speaking migrants from southeastern Africa arrived around 1000AD. They introduced the zebu, a type of long-horned humped cattle, which <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> in large herds.|$|E
5|$|In either late-1938 or early-1939 Lutteroth and EMLL {{declared}} that Gus Kallio, due to holding the National Wrestling Association World Middleweight Championship was also {{recognized as the}} World Middleweight Champion in Mexico. On February 19, 1939 Kallio lost the championship to EMLL wrestler Octavio Gaona, to create EMLL's main championship for the middleweight division. In 1952 EMLL joined the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and the middleweight championship was rebranded as the NWA World Middleweight Championship from that point forward. In 1989 EMLL left the NWA because the promoters {{did not want to}} deal with the internal politics of the NWA at the time. While they left the NWA <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> promoting the NWA World Middleweight Championship as well as the NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship and the NWA World Welterweight Championship that they had controlled for years.|$|E
