2500|$|Synthesizers became {{easier to}} {{integrate}} and synchronize with other electronic instruments and controllers {{with the introduction}} of Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) in 1983. First proposed in 1981 by engineer Dave Smith of Sequential Circuits, the MIDI standard was developed by a consortium now known as the MIDI Manufacturers Association. MIDI is an opto-isolated serial interface and communication protocol. It provides for the transmission from one device or instrument to another of real-time performance data. [...] This data includes note events, commands for the selection of instrument presets (i.e. sounds, or programs or patches, previously stored in the instrument's memory), the control of performance-related parameters such as volume, effects levels and the like, as well as synchronization, <b>transport</b> <b>control</b> and other types of data. [...] MIDI interfaces are now almost ubiquitous on music equipment and are commonly available on personal computers (PCs).|$|E
2500|$|British-Irish {{co-operation}} was {{a controversial}} proposal for both sides, as {{most members of}} the Irish political establishment had been combatants in the Irish War of Independence between 1919 and 1921. However, because of the threat of German occupation and seizure of Ireland and especially the valuable Irish ports, Plan W was developed. Northern Ireland was to serve as the base of a new British Expeditionary Force that would move across the Irish border to repel the invaders from any beach-head established by German paratroopers. In addition, coordinated actions of the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy were planned to repel German air and sea invasion. According to a restricted file prepared by the British Army's [...] "Q" [...] Movements <b>Transport</b> <b>Control</b> in Belfast, the British would not have crossed the border [...] "until invited to do so by the Irish Government," [...] and it is not clear who would have had the operational authority over the British troops invited into the State by Éamon de Valera.
