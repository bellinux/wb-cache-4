40|$|As {{software}} {{becomes more}} complicated and large-scaled, user's demands become various and the expectation level about a software product becomes higher. Therefore, {{it is very important}} that a software engineer analyzes user's requirements precisely and applies them effectively in the development step. This paper proposes a requirement analysis supporting system that effectively reduces and revises errors of requirements analysis. The proposed system measures the similarity between requirements specifications or sentences. It extracts the sentences that contain ambiguous words. An indexing method for the similarity measurement combines a sliding window model and a parser model. This method can complement each model's weak points. Using these methods in information retrieval, the proposed system supports a function to trace dependency between documents, improve completeness in a document, reduce inconsistency between sentences, and improve document quality.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method of}} {{coalition}} formation for assigning tasks to appropriate agents to improve the efficiency of multiagentsystems. To form a coalition, weintroduce subjective information to agents, which are the internal information of the agents. The subjective information reflect the agents' cooperativebehavior of the past. Next, we introduce loose coalition, a concept of a coalition of agents based on the subjective information. Using the agents' sense of values defined by their subjective information, eachagent can give priority to the loose coalitions {{to ask for the}} working status or to assign tasks. Thus loose coalitions with higher priority will be better cooperating candidates. Furthermore, loose coalitions enable agents to collect information (e. g. busyness of loose coalitions) for task assignment efficiently. Therefore, the agents on the system can decide its behavior properly, depending on the current status of the system, and thus <b>the</b> <b>efficie</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an empirical {{study of the}} SPECjvm 98 benchmarks, using the Jalape~no virtual machine. The study employs two compilers, a nonoptimizing compiler that is initially used to compile all application methods, and an optimizing compiler that is selectively used to recompile a parameterized set of hot methods based on past profiling. We view this study as a step in examining the feasibility of adaptive optimization in this environment. The results show promise for adaptive optimization. In particular, they show that the combined time (execution and compilation) of selective opt-compilation can be less than the execution time of no opt-compilation and the combined time of full opt-compilation. The results also show that the combined time of selective opt-compilation can be competitive with static compilation (full opt-compilation not counting compilation time) for the SPECjvm 98 benchmarks with input size 100. 1 Introduction One technique for increasing <b>the</b> <b>efficie</b> [...] ...|$|E

40|$|In {{functional}} programming, small {{programs are}} often glued together {{to construct a}} complex program. Program fusion is an optimizing process whereby these small programs are fused into a single one and intermediate data structures are removed. Recent work {{has made it clear}} that this process is especially successful if the recursive definitions are expressed in terms of hylomorphisms. In this paper, we propose an algorithm which can automatically turn all practical recursive definitions into structural hylomorphisms making program fusion be easily applied. 1 Introduction The compositional style of functional programming has the advantages of clarity and higher level of modularity. It constructs a complex program by gluing components which are relatively simple, easier to write, and potentially more reusable. However, some data structures, which are constructed in one component and consumed in another but never appear in the result of the whole program, give rise to <b>the</b> problem of <b>efficie</b> [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a balancing controller for a 3 D multibody {{model of a}} human biped. This model-based controller forms a model using a recursive formulation of workspace control. The recursive techniques free the control designer from generating the complicated equations of motion. The paper describes first the biped model and then the recursive workspace controller. Simulation results of the human model reacting to a disturbance are presented. 1 Introduction The balancing controller described in this paper {{is part of a}} research effort to develop predictive models of human motion. These predictive models must appropriately react to disturbances and produce behaviors that mimic those of human beings. The approach used to develop predictive models is first to create a multibody model of a human biped and then to design control algorithms to command the system to balance, walk, run, jump, adapt to loads, and change directions.

40|$|Gastrointestinal {{parasitism}} (GI) is a {{major health}} and welfare problem of farmed ruminants. It affects animal health and has {{a negative impact on}} overall productivity of herds. Since the 1960 s, chemotherapy is the principal means of nematode control. However, the emergence of resistance of strongyles to chemical anthelmintics has become a widespread phenomenon in the world. These factors led the search to consider alternative solutions to fight against GI parasites of ruminants. This thesis is part of the scientific program of the INRA - URZ unit on multicriteria evaluation of plant resources and integrated management against GI parasites of ruminants. Integrated management combines several control methods including herbal medicines. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the nematicidal activity of some plant resources against the Haemonchus contortus digestive strongyles, and secondly to characterize the chemical class responsible for the activity and then to explain the mode of action. In a first part, a literature survey of plant resources available in the Antilles - Guyane for health use has been made. This has shown that these regions have a veritable arsenal of plants {{for a wide range of}} pathologies. A screening for in vitro egg hatching and larval development with the model H. contortus was then performed on 14 plants, all showed anthelmintic effect on at least one stage. <b>The</b> <b>efficie</b> ncy varies between 20 % and 55 % on the hatching of eggs, and 26 % to 98 % for larval development. In a second part, the 4 plants: Cucurbita moschata, Tabernaemontana citrifolia, Musa x paradisiaca and Manihot esculenta, were selected in relation to diversity in secondary metabolites of interest that they contain: condensed tannins, flavonoids, lkaloids, amino compounds, terpenoids, to carry out in vitro tests. The in vitro targeting the 4 key developmental stages: egg hatching, development of L 1 to L 2, L 3 lar val migration and motility of adult worms. These plants have all shown a nematicidal action with variations depending on the stage, highlighting the specificity of the molecules with respect to parasitic stages. Thus, indole alkaloids act on the 4 stages, flavonoids and terpenoids affect the adult stage, while condensed tannins, amino compounds, flavonoids and terpenoids have an impact on the larval development. In a third part, both models banana (Musa x paradisiaca) and cassava leaves (Manihot esculenta) were evaluated in vivo. In addition to their potential nutritional and nematicidal effects, these two resources have the interest to allow recovery of co-products from agricultural crops. The involvement of condensed tannins from cassava was confirmed by the use of PEG as a specific inhibitor. Effects on the installation of infective larvae (only for cassava), on the fertility of female worms and on the larval development were observed (both plants). In conclusion, these studies show first, that plant resources are a real alternative to synthetic anthelmintics, and secondly, the interest to combine phytochemical knowledge with zootechnical knowledge, particularly in order to develop the concept of nutriceuticals. The solution for the control of GI strongyles by limiting the use of anthelminthic chemicals seems to be integrated management, with a multi-criteria approach in which the herbal take a share. For this it is necessary to standardize research on antiparasitic plants (in vitro methods, threshold values for the active antinutrutional factors). A comprehensive approach taking into account not only the antiparasitc potential, the immunomodulator potential and nutrition but also the economic criterion, would incorporate the best plant resources in livestock production systems in order to improve the level of production while reducing agricultural inputs...|$|E
40|$|The title {{compounds}} (1 and 2, above) were synthesized by Sonogashira {{coupling reactions}} of appropriate Ru(1 I) complexes with the electron a cceptors. Characterization {{was conducted in}} solution and in frozen ma trices. Finally, the title compounds were evaluated as dopants of sol-gel materials. It was found that <b>the</b> intramolecular quenching <b>efficie</b> ncy of 4 -benzoyl-Nmethylpyridinium cation in solution depends on the solvent: photoluminescence is quenched completely in CH,CN, but not i n methanol or ethanol. On the other hand, intramolecular emission que nching by 4 -benzyl-N-methyl viologen is complete in all solvents. The {{difference between the two}} quenchers is traced electrochemically to t he solvation of the 4 -benzoyl-Nmethylpyridiniums by alcohol. In froze n matrices or adsorbed on the surfaces of silica aerogel, both Ru(I 1) complex/electron acceptor dyads of this study are photoluminescent, and the absence of quenching has been traced to the environmental rigi dity. When doped aerogels are cooled at 77 K, the emission intensity increases by approximately 4 x, and the spectra shift to the blue, analogous to what is observed with Ru(I 1) complexes in solutions undergoi ng fluid-to-rigid transition. However, in contrast to frozen solution s, the luminescent moieties in the bulk of aerogels kept at low tempe ratures are still accessible to gas-phase quenchers diffusing through the mesopores, leading to more sensitive platforms for sensors than o ther room-temperature configurations. Thus the photoluminescence of o ur Ru(I 1) complex dyads adsorbed on aerogel is quenchable by O 2 both at room temperature and at 77 K. Furthermore, it was also found that O 2 modulates the photoluminescence of aerogels doped with 4 -benzoyl -N -methylpyridinium-based dyads over a wider dynamic range compared wi th aerogels doped with either our vislogen-based dyads or with Ru(I 1) tris(1,lO-phenanthroline) itself...|$|R
