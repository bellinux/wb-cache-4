5|$|Amenhotep's reign saw {{literary}} developments. The Book of What {{is in the}} Underworld ('the Egyptian Book of the Dead'), {{an important}} funerary text used in the New Kingdom, {{is believed to have}} reached its final form during Amenhotep's reign, since it first appears in the decoration of the tomb of his successor Thutmose I. The Ebers papyrus, which is the main source for information on ancient Egyptian medicine, also seems to date to this time (the mention of the Heliacal rise of Sothis by which the early New Kingdom chronology is usually calculated was found on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> document).|$|E
5|$|In their {{descriptions}} of Plesiorycteropus, Lamberton and Patterson posited different {{interpretations of the}} location of the mandibular fossa, where the mandible (lower jaw) articulates with the cranium. MacPhee found problems with either interpretation and suggested that the true mandibular fossa was part of the area Lamberton identified as such, {{at the side of the}} braincase. The fossa is small and low, suggesting that the animal was not capable of powerful biting. At <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> fossa is a pseudoglenoid proces, which is more prominent in P.germainepetterae. In P.germainepetterae but not P.madagascariensis, a small opening, perhaps the vascular foramen, is present next to the foramen ovale. The petrosal bone forms a relatively large portion of the roof of the tympanic cavity, which houses the middle ear; parts of the petrosal are more developed in P.madagascariensis. Endocasts (casts of the inside of the skull) indicate that the neopallium part of the brain was relatively small.|$|E

Finally upon {{re-entering}} the 1964 event, he won the English Amateur title, defeating John Spencer 11–8 in the final. This victory led to an invitation to tour South Africa. This proved to be so successful that Reardon was offered the chance to tour it again as a professional. On <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> Reardon resigned as a policeman and duly turned professional in 1967.|$|E
25|$|By 1820, Hobart Town {{had grown}} to {{accommodate}} over 10,000 people, and had become an important Pacific base for the Royal Navy. The plentiful natural resources of the island also proved useful for the Royal Navy, who had soon turned Hobart into a thriving port. The docks were busy as the Navy shipped materials such as timber, flax and rum from Hobart Town. By this time {{it had become a}} vital Southern ocean re-supply stop for international shipping and trade, and therefore a major freight hub for the British Empire. Wealth poured into the port on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> trade, and in 1823 the Van Diemen's Land Bank, the first in the colony, began operations.|$|E
25|$|Marshall's initial senior {{appearance}} was a Geddes Grant/Harrison Line Trophy (List A) match for Barbados on 13 February 1978; again {{he made a}} duck and did not take a wicket. Four days later, he made his first-class debut against Jamaica, and whilst he failed to score runs, he claimed 6–77 in the Jamaican first innings. On <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> single first-class appearance he was selected to tour India in 1978/79, many first-choice West Indian stars being unavailable having committed themselves to playing World Series Cricket. Marshall heard of his selection on the radio while working in the storeroom at Banks Brewery and later claimed {{he did not know}} where India was.|$|E

25|$|Ahead of the 2011–12 season Hyde {{appointed}} Gary Lowe as manager, with Martyn Booty as his assistant. Their first 10 matches of {{the season}} saw Hyde win every match, equalling Hyde's best ever start to a season {{dating back to the}} 1925–26 season and also breaking the record for the best ever start to a season in Conference North.

25|$|He {{returned}} to Great Britain in 1767, where he once more {{became involved in}} the politics of the East India Company. He had previously been {{one of a number of}} his family to support Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive in 1764, but by 1767 Clive was persecuting George's brother John Johnstone, who was at this time a member of the company's council in Bengal. George Johnstone spoke out and voted against Clive, gaining a reputation as an orator. He sought election to Parliament on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> reputation, and after securing the patronage of Sir James Lowther was elected to represent Cockermouth in 1768. He became part of the parliamentary group supporting Lowther's interests, and retained his membership after his election to the constituency of Appleby in 1774. He continued to be active in the politics of the East India Company, using his parliamentary position to make speeches attacking the North Ministry's schemes for Indian reform, and laying the blame for the chaos in Bengal at Clive's door. He found favour for doing so with the company's court of proprietors, who made him chair of a proprietary committee aiming to block plans for company reform. Despite these efforts, the Prime Minister, Lord North, was able to pass an act regulating the East India Company in 1773.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics for [...] "My Happiness" [...] {{were written}} by Bernard Fanning, Powderfinger's lead singer and songwriter.

Fanning called it [...] "a sad story of touring and the absence loneliness that comes with it". The extensive time spent touring took its toll on the band, and it was on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> that Fanning wrote [...] "My Happiness". Thus, he expressed confusion at its being considered a romantic song.|$|E
