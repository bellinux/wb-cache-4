500|$|When Diane first played me {{what she}} had begun with the song, I needed no convincing about the record... it was about sharing that part of myself with the world... We {{talked a lot about}} what I felt the song needed in order to reach as many young people as possible. I felt that it needed to not stay in a purely {{emotional}} state, but {{that it was going to}} somehow grow throughout the performance and the song and by the end, kind of be full of rage. I feel like what this song accomplishes is women—or men—rising to say, 'You think you can hurt me? You don't know about power. Because after what you did <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>you</b> don't even know how much stronger I am.' ...|$|E

500|$|A career-high 23 goals led Suter's 81-point {{campaign}} in 1992–93, but he again struggled {{with a pair}} of knee injuries that caused him to miss three months of the 1993–94 season and limited him to 25 games for the Flames. His tenure with Calgary ended on March 10, 1994, when the team included him in a six-player trade. [...] The Flames sent Suter, along with Paul Ranheim and Ted Drury, to the Hartford Whalers in exchange for James Patrick, Zarley Zalapski and Michael Nylander. The move surprised Suter: [...] "Calgary's meant a great deal <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>You</b> always hear how trades are part of the game and that you don't have any control over them.

500|$|Taraborrelli {{noted in}} Madonna: An Intimate Biography that {{the lyrics of}} the song consist of [...] "a series of button-pushing anomalies". With Madonna's {{inclusion}} of double entendres in the lyrics, [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] sounded religious to him but has an undertone of sexual tension. This was achieved by the gospel choir, whose voice heightens the song's spiritual nature, while the rock guitar sound keeps it dark and mysterious. For O'Brien, the lyrics describe Madonna receiving a vocation from God. Certain portions of the lyrics also alluded to Sean Penn and their failed marriage. According to Priya Elan from NME, the line [...] "Just like a muse <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>You</b> are a mystery" [...] {{was an example of}} this, befitting the description of an unattainable lover. This was also evident in the artwork for the 12" [...] version, painted by her brother, Christopher Ciccone. It shows the letters MLVC, standing for Madonna Louise Veronica Ciccone, with a prominent letter P for Penn, detached from the group.|$|E
500|$|After Jean's {{version of}} [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] was {{rejected}} by her record company, she was upset that Beyoncé recorded and released the ballad. Roger Friedman of Fox News wrote that Jean was first informed that Beyoncé recorded the song by a stranger. The Daily Telegraph reported that Beyoncé's father and then-manager Mathew Knowles pursued the publishing rights of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] after realizing that it {{had the potential to}} become a big hit. Jean used her Myspace account to express her frustration: [...] "I have been reading some of these comments and {{to set the record straight}} from the horse's mouth – IF I WERE A BOY is my song; YES, I wrote this song; It is my story; a painful one, and the song is very dear <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>You</b> can hear the original version on my myspace site." [...] Friedman later reported that Beyoncé and Jean had come to terms. The deal included a promise that Beyoncé would record a duet with Jean for her debut album.|$|E

500|$|Dykins later managed several bars in Liverpool, {{which allowed}} Julia {{to stay at}} home at Blomfield Road, to look after Baird, Jackie, a cat named [...] "Elvis", and the 11-year-old Lennon, who had started to visit and {{occasionally}} stayed overnight. Baird would give up her bed to Lennon, and share Jackie's double bed. Dykins used to give Lennon weekly pocket money (one shilling) for doing odd jobs, such as collecting golf balls on the local course, on top of the five shillings that Lennon's Aunt Mimi gave him. During Lennon's visits, he would climb trees with Baird and Jackie, test Baird's spelling, and once gave Baird half-a-crown to leave him alone when he wanted to kiss his first girlfriend. Baird remembered that after Lennon had visited them, her mother would often play a record called, My Son John, <b>To</b> <b>Me</b> <b>You</b> Are So Wonderful, [...] "by some old crooner, and sit and listen to it". [...] "My Son John"—sung by David Whitfield—was released in 1956. Although Mimi sent Lennon to his Aunt's croft in Sango Bay, Durness, Scotland, for his holidays, he later persuaded Mimi to let him take short holidays in North Wales with the Dykins family. Julia took Baird and Jackie to Rosebury Street, Liverpool, to watch Lennon play with The Quarrymen {{on the back of a}} flatbed coal truck on 22 June 1957. Baird was allowed to sit on the back, but as the music was too loud she asked to be taken off. The Quarrymen played twice that day as part of a celebration to mark the 750th anniversary of the granting of Liverpool's charter by King John. Lennon and McCartney would later rehearse in the bathroom of Blomfield Road because they said the acoustics [...] "sounded like a recording studio".|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} themes {{found in this}} book; some that are {{recurring}} are roles in society, religion, relationships, and also hybrid nature of American and Mexican ethnicities. Within these short stories Cisneros concentrates on the identities which women appropriate {{as a result of}} relationships, and how these are connected with their roles in society. [...] Critic Mary Reichart observes that in Cisneros's previous work as well as [...] "in Woman Hollering Creek (1991), the female characters break out of the molds assigned to them by the culture in search of new roles and new kinds of relationships. Cisneros portrays women who challenge stereotypes and break taboos, sometimes simply for the sake of shocking the establishment, but most often because the confining stereotypes prevent them from achieving their own identity." [...] An example of this is Cleófilas, who had hoped for a better life after leaving her home in Mexico to live in the United States. [...] The soap operas she had seen had led her to believe that her life {{was going to be a}} fairy tale. [...] Instead, with a failing marriage and another child on the way she sees that her life resembles only the saddest aspects of a soap opera. [...] Another example of this is found in the final section of this book, entitled [...] "There Was A Man, There Was A Woman", where Cisneros illustrates how women can use their bodies as political instruments in their attempts to fight against male domination. [...] The two female protagonists in [...] "Never Marry a Mexican" [...] and [...] "Eyes of Zapata" [...] use their bodies in attempts to gain recognition and acceptance from husband and lover. [...] However, in doing so, they face the problems of objectification and oppression; two issues which end up adversely shaping the characters' identities. [...] In the end, the illegitimate societal roles of these women influence their quest for female identity. For example, Inés, in [...] "Eyes of Zapata", talks about the role she plays as lover, not a wife: [...] "You married her, that woman from Villa de Ayala, true. But see, you came back <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>You</b> always come back. In between and beyond the others. That's my magic. You come back to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Scholars {{and authors}} have also commented on these changes. Southern Methodist University's Director of Medieval Studies Bonnie Wheeler is [...] "convinced {{that the new}} Robert Zemeckis movie {{treatment}} sacrifices {{the power of the}} original for a plot line that propels Beowulf into seduction by Angelina Jolie—the mother of the monster he has just slain. What man doesn’t get involved with Angelina Jolie?' Wheeler asks. 'It’s a great cop-out on a great poem.' ... 'For me, the sad thing is the movie returns to…a view of the horror of woman, the monstrous female who will kill off the male,' Wheeler says. 'It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> could do so much better now. And the story of Beowulf is so much more powerful.'" [...] Other commentators pointed to the theories elucidated in John Grigsby's work Beowulf and Grendel, where Grendel's mother was linked with the ancient Germanic fertility goddess Nerthus.|$|E

We want to govern Fiji in every respect as this land is governed. I have come to white man's land to be trained at Newington College. I am anxious to be taught.

2500|$|Ibn Qutaybah, a 9th-century Sunni Islamic scholar narrates of Ali:I am {{the servant}} of God and {{the brother of}} the Messenger of God. I am thus more worthy of this office than you. I shall not give {{allegiance}} to you [...] when it is more proper for you to give bay’ah <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>You</b> have seized this office from the Ansar using your tribal relationship to the Prophet as an argument against them. Would you then seize this office from us, the ahl al-bayt by force? Did you not claim before the Ansar that you were more worthy than they of the caliphate because Muhammad came from among you (but Muhammad was never from AbuBakr family) – and thus they gave you leadership and surrendered command? I now contend against you with the same argument…It is we who are more worthy of the Messenger of God, living or dead. Give us our due right if you truly have faith in God, or else bear the charge of wilfully doing wrong... Umar, I will not yield to your commands: I shall not pledge loyalty to him.' Ultimately Abu Bakr said, [...] "O 'Ali! If you do not desire to give your bay'ah, I am not going to force you for the same.Ali's wife, and daughter of Muhammad, Fatimah, refused to pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr and remained angry with him until she died due to the issues of Fadak and her inheritance from her father and the situation of Umar at Fatimah's house. This is stated in sahih Sunni Hadith, Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim. Fatimah did not at all pledge allegiance or acknowledge or accept the caliphate of Abu Bakr. Almost all of Banu Hashim, Muhammad's clan and many of the sahaba, had supported Ali's cause after the demise of the prophet whilst others supported Abu Bakr.|$|E
