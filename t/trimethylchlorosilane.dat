The modified calcium hydroxide obtained at three repetitive stages of the silylation reaction has been investigated by the x-ray phase analysis, IR spectroscopy, thermal analysis, electron microscopy in a combination with the elemental analysis. It has been determined that at the first stage of the interaction the processes of the <b>trimethylchlorosilane</b> hydrolysis and of the hydrolysis products condensation dominate, {{and at the same time}} an adsorption process of the <b>trimethylchlorosilane</b> and its derivatives starts. Further, the hydrolysis of the <b>trimethylchlorosilane</b> by the «new» portions of a water formed in the reaction of a calcium hydroxide with a hydrogen chloride takes place, simultaneously the secondary reactions of the Si-O-Ca – ties’ formation and cleavage occur including as a silylation-desilylation dynamic equilibrium process...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} study on the hydrophobization of spin-on Silicalite- 1 zeolite films through {{silylation}} with <b>trimethylchlorosilane.</b> Microporous and micro-mesoporous Silicalite- 1 films were synthesized by spin coating of suspensions of Silicalite- 1 nanozeolite crystallized for different times. Ellipsometric porosimetry with toluene and water adsorbates reveals that silylation decreases the porosity and makes the films hydrophobic. The decrease in porosity depends on the exposed surface area in the pores. Water contact angle measurements confirm the hydrophobicity. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveals that the trimethylsilyl groups are chemisorbed selectively on isolated silanols and less on geminal and vicinal silanols due to steric limitations. Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy and in situ ellipsometry analysis of the reaction kinetics show that the silylation is a bulk process occurring in the absence of diffusion limitation. Electrical current leakage on films decreases upon silylation. Silylation with <b>trimethylchlorosilane</b> is shown to be an effective hydrophobization method for spin-on Silicalite- 1 zeolite films. No Full Tex...|$|E
