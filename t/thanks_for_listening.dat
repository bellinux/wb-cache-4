[...] and [...] "The Love Bug Will Bite You." [...] Hollywood beckoned, and Tomlin was featured in films for various studios. In 1935 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer offered to groom the young singer and build him up as an actor. Tomlin, however, preferred to concentrate on his musical career, although he did appear in three MGM films released that year: Times Square Lady, Smart Girl, and King Solomon of Broadway. [...] He soon, however, returned to the [...] "big screen," [...] appearing or starring in seven more feature films between 1936 and 1938: Paddy O'Day, Don't Get Personal, With Love and Kisses, Sing While You're Able, Swing It Professor, <b>Thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>Listening,</b> and Down in 'Arkansaw'.A guest appearance on Eddie Cantor's Texaco Town radio show in June 1937 subsequently led to a regular spot on the program, which Cantor rescinded when his sponsor's publicity man tried to recruit Tomlin as Cantor's replacement. Tomlin met this professional setback by organizing his own swing band in 1938. For more than two years [...] "Pinky Tomlin and His Orchestra" [...] played in theaters, nightclubs, and school proms across most of America, on a whirlwind schedule prepared by the agency. The band was successful, but the constant travel became difficult for Tomlin, as he was devoted to his family. After the tour, apart from a wartime stint with the USO, he confined his appearances to occasional motion pictures and television shows.|$|E

[...] An alternate radio edit of the song without the lyric exists, with the following explanation by the artist: [...] "To the radio community: The enclosed CD contains two versions of [...] "LA Song" [...] the first single from my new album, Screamin' for My Supper. The original version of the song includes a line where, {{in the midst of}} a dark period in my life, I talk about having a gun. I wrote this song before the recent tragic shootings that have so shaken this country. In light of these horrible events, and especially out of respect for those who have been deeply affected by them, I have chosen to record an alternate version with a new lyric which remains true to the essence of the song. Ultimately [...] "LA Song" [...] is about emerging from depression and self-doubt to the realization that who you are isn't about where you are or what's around you but that [...] "THE GOOD LIFE LIES WITHIN." [...] I don't want one particular lyric to prevent the song's positive message from reaching as many listeners as possible. As an Artist, I have the responsibility to not compromise my work. As a radio programmer, you have the responsibility to decide what's most appropriate for your audience. <b>Thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>listening!</b> Love, Beth" [...] Despite this, some radio stations, such as Cities 97, play the song with the original lyric.|$|E

40|$|The {{polyhedron}} model provides {{one possible}} approach to model-based program analysis and transformation. Over the years, it has undergone many improvements {{in order to}} handle a still growing class of programs. A recent approach enabled the use of non-linear parameters, which was in that generality not possible before. While this new framework uses real quantifier elimination, the present work examines possibilities to describe the integral solutions to certain problems occurring in the polyhedron model exactly. In particular, we study the solvability of systems of linear Diophantine equations in one and several non-linear integral parameters and demonstrate {{the applicability of the}} developed methods for Banerjee’s data dependence analysis.
