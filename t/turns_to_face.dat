5|$|Simultaneously, Peter (Joshua Jackson) {{has decided}} {{to open up to}} Olivia (Anna Torv) and shows her the five data discs from the shapeshifters he killed after the doomsday device weaponized him. As he {{discusses}} it with her, Olivia hears the sound of the bell. She <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Peter, revealing herself to now be possessed by Bell.|$|E
5|$|The {{control pad}} {{may be used}} to move the hero in any {{direction}} and to move the flashing cursor in menu displays. Additional buttons confirm and cancel commands. In the English version, players use menu commands to talk to people, check their status, search beneath their feet, use items, take treasure chests, open doors, and go up or down stairs. However, in some of the game's later remakes, certain commands were assigned to buttons, navigating stairs became automatic, and the hero's speed was increased. In the Japanese version, characters always face forward, so players must choose a command and then a direction in which to perform that action. In the North American version, the hero <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the direction he is moving, making direction selection unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|The {{positioning}} of these figures closely {{resembles that of}} two persons depicted in the van Eyck panel. In that painting the right-hand figure <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> his companion, gesturing at him to look outwards. In the van der Weyden, the equivalent figure seems protective of his friend, who here is female, while the left-hand figure in the earlier panel might represent {{a tribute to the}} artist's brother Hubert who had died in the 1420s. A red headdress was an indicator of self-portraiture for van Eyck. As in the van Eyck, the figures act as examples of repoussoir, in that they draw our attention to the picture's underlying theme – the painting's ability to visualize the infinity of the world in the landscape. The painting may allude to the concept of paragone; the man points to the landscape, perhaps highlighting the ability of painting, unlike sculpture, to supply its foreground with background.|$|E

2500|$|Often, the batsman is {{only allowed}} <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the next {{delivery}} if {{they hit the}} ball. If they miss and are not dismissed, they must attempt to play the next ball (which is bowled from where the ball ended up after the previous delivery) without being allowed <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> it. Sometimes additionally, if the batsman does not <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the ball before a fielder picks it up, they would have <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> their waist and face the fielder bowling in order to hit the ball.|$|R

5|$|The boar-hunting scene is, in contrast, {{laden with}} detail. Boars were (and are) much more {{difficult}} to hunt than deer; approaching one with only a sword was akin to challenging a knight to single combat. In the hunting sequence, the boar flees but is cornered before a ravine. He <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Bertilak {{with his back to the}} ravine, prepared to fight. Bertilak dismounts and in the ensuing fight kills the boar. He removes its head and displays it on a pike. In the seduction scene, Bertilak's wife, like the boar, is more forward, insisting that Gawain has a romantic reputation and that he must not disappoint her. Gawain, however, is successful in parrying her attacks, saying that surely she knows more than he about love. Both the boar hunt and the seduction scene can be seen as depictions of a moral victory: both Gawain and Bertilak face struggles alone and emerge triumphant.|$|E
25|$|In the 2003 revival {{starring}} Bernadette Peters, {{the final}} dialogue scene remains, but leaves the ending open to more interpretation from the audience. Louise {{walks through the}} stage door, with Rose following behind. Rose then <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the audience, a look of sadness and longing on {{her face as she}} takes one last look at the empty stage. She pauses and slowly closes the door.|$|E

This time the assistant is on a door-sized rectangular board that spins about a central vertical axis. Again the thrower must execute {{a series of}} rapid, consistent and carefully timed throws to land knives on parts of the board {{not covered by the}} assistant's body. Sometimes the aim is to hit the back of the board in the moments that the assistant is turned away from the thrower. Other throwers have placed a vertical row of knives down the sides of the assistant at the moments when the assistant <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> them.|$|E

500|$|Delphine {{does not}} visit Goriot as he lies on his deathbed, and Anastasie arrives too late, only once {{he has lost}} consciousness. Before dying, Goriot rages about their disrespect toward him. His funeral is {{attended}} only by Rastignac, a servant named Christophe, and two paid mourners. Goriot's daughters, rather than being present at the funeral, send their empty coaches, each bearing their families' respective coat of arms. After the short ceremony, Rastignac <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Paris as the lights of evening begin to appear. He sets out to dine with Delphine de Nucingen and declares to the city: [...] "À nous deux, maintenant!" [...] ("It's {{between you and me}} now!") ...|$|E
500|$|The series premiere {{begins at}} Sunnydale High School, where a boy (played by Carmine Giovinazzo) breaks {{into the school}} during the night with a {{seemingly}} reluctant girl (Julie Benz), promising her mischief and therefore fun. Nervous and on edge, the girl says she thinks she heard something and fears someone is in the school, other than the two of them. The boy calls out but gets no response, leading him to say [...] "it's nothing" [...] to the girl and assure her that they [...] "are alone". The girl says [...] " [...] ok, that's good", after which she <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the boy, revealing her facial morph into her true identity; a vampire. She then bites the boy's neck. She is later revealed to be Darla.|$|E
500|$|Stepping {{back into}} the bedroom, the woman <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the man and confronts him, asking slowly [...] "what the fuck is going on?" [...] He motions to her to join him {{on the bed and}} at her prompting, he reveals in the ensuing {{conversation}} that he has been living in the hotel room for [...] "more than a month", and that he had left to escape their relationship. They lie back on the bed looking at one another before being interrupted by the arrival of room service. Once alone again, the two kiss and the man begins to undress the woman. They have an uncomfortable exchange about not having slept with other people and when he notices bruises on her arm after undressing her further, the woman chooses not to comment on them. Lying on top of him, she tells the man that she does not want to lose his friendship, that she loves him and never meant to hurt him. He responds coldly that he [...] "will never be [...] friend", but holds her when she embraces him. [...] "Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?" [...] starts again and the man offers to show the woman his view of Paris.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the climax}} of the [...] "M Fanfare", the drum major {{performs}} a signature move. The drum major moves {{from the middle of the}} band to the north end 20-yard line. He/she then takes off their hat, <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the south end zone, and bends backwards to touch his/her head to the ground. This is done every game. [...] Originally, drum majors kept their hat on and touched its plume to the ground. The first drum major to do this was Mark Brown in the late 1960s. Brown was extremely flexible and could touch the plume to the ground between his heels.|$|E
2500|$|The handler {{leaves the}} dog in a sitting {{position}} at {{one side of the}} ring, walks to the opposite side, and <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the dog. [...] On the judge's command, the handler calls or signals the dog to come. [...] The dog must come directly to the handler at a brisk trot or gallop, and sit squarely in front, close enough that the handler can touch the dog's head without bending or stretching, but not between the handler's feet. [...] On the judge's order, the handler commands or signals the dog to [...] "finish". [...] The dog must go briskly to the heel position and sit squarely at heel..|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, {{the track}} {{garnered}} generally positive reviews by music critics. Alex Macpherson of The Guardian declared [...] "Right Here (Departed)" [...] Humans [...] "finest moment" [...] and wrote that [...] "Norwood <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the world, though: 'Right Here (Departed)' is a cosmic, ride-or-die declaration of epic scope." [...] Emmanuel Ezugwu, reviewer for RWD Magazine, called the song a [...] "joyous ode to overcoming insurmountable odds." [...] Los Angeles Times writer Mikael Wood, barely satisfied with Human in general, called [...] "Right Here (Departed)" [...] {{one of the}} [...] "few highlights" [...] on the album, stating: [...] "Catchy lead single 'Right Here (Departed)' manages to dial down Brandy's introspection and increase the groove factor." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band then <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> {{east and}} plays Wilson's [...] "For I, For S". The {{students}} in the [...] "S" [...] mark time while the [...] "I" [...] and the [...] "U" [...] march {{together to form a}} grand central block. They then flip and march back out, having reversed the [...] "floating ISU" [...] to face the east stands and students' section. [...] "The National Anthem Fanfare" [...] is the next song performed, while the band forms a star-like shape in front of the central [...] line ladder. [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] is played under the colors of Iowa State's Reserve Officer Training Corps unit (conducted by the director of a visiting band if one is present). This is followed by [...] "The Bells of Iowa State"―a song inspired by the Campanile.|$|E
2500|$|NY364 {{begins at}} a four-way {{intersection}} with NY14A (Liberty Street) {{in the northern}} portion of the village of Penn Yan in Yates County. The route heads west as Maple Avenue, passing north of the Penn Yan Central School District's campus before leaving the village for more rural areas {{of the town of}} Benton. NY364 crosses open farmland and rapidly ascends in elevation as it travels northwestward out of the valley surrounding Keuka Lake. After ascending [...] in roughly , the route begins to level off as it heads toward the town of Potter. In Potter, NY364 <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> due west, taking on a linear eastwest alignment for most of its first [...] in the town. At the end of the stretch, the road descends approximately [...] into another valley containing Flint and Nettle Valley Creeks, both of which flow into a large marsh known as Potter Swamp.|$|E
2500|$|At the chiming of midnight, the revelers and Prospero {{notice a}} figure in a dark, blood-splattered robe {{resembling}} a funeral shroud. The figure's mask resembles the rigid face of a corpse and exhibits the traits of the Red Death. Gravely insulted, Prospero demands to know {{the identity of the}} mysterious guest so they can hang him. The guests, too afraid to approach the figure, instead let him pass through the six chambers. The Prince pursues him with a drawn dagger and corners the guest in the seventh room. When the figure <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> him, the Prince lets out a sharp cry and falls dead. The enraged and terrified revelers surge into the black room and forcibly remove the mask and robe, only to find to their horror that there is nothing underneath. Only then do they realize the figure is the Red Death itself, and all of the guests contract and succumb to the disease. The final line of the story sums up, [...] "And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held [...] dominion over all".|$|E

2500|$|The band {{begins the}} {{performance}} in the south end zone of the stadium and is called to attention by the drum major right before he marches out across the end zone {{in front of the}} band. [...] Stopping at the goal line, the drum major wields his mace and uses his whistle to signal the band to take the field. [...] The band marches out of the end zone to the beat of a single bass drum in fronts separated by five-yard intervals. [...] The drum major halts at the 40 yard line on {{the far end of the}} field and the band is now spread across the southern half of the field with the color guard at midfield and the southern goal line. The golden girls line up next on the west sideline next to the band. The band stands at attention and awaits the percussion introduction to [...] "Pregame Salute." [...] As the band plays the stirring opening chords of the salute (which are taken from the tune [...] "Tiger Rag"), the band <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> all four corners of the stadium. [...] The crowd explodes in cheers. [...] Once the band salutes each part of the stadium, the pace of the music and the marching picks up, the music transitions into Long’s [...] "Touchdown for LSU," [...] and the band sweeps the field. [...] Toward the end of the song, the band breaks the fronts and spells out [...] "LSU." ...|$|E
