40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} reinsurance or risk sharing from a macroeconomic point of view. Our {{aim is to}} find socially optimal <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties.</b> In our setting we assume that there are $n$ insurance companies each bearing a certain risk and one representative reinsurer. The optimization problem is to minimize {{the sum of all}} capital requirements of the insurers where we assume that all insurance companies use a form of Range-Value-at-Risk. We show that in case all insurers use Value-at-Risk and the reinsurer's premium principle satisfies monotonicity, then layer <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties</b> are socially optimal. For this result we do not need any dependence structure between the risks. In the general setting with Range-Value-at-Risk we obtain again the optimality of layer <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties</b> under further assumptions, in particular under the assumption that the individual risks are positively dependent through the stochastic ordering. At the end, we discuss the difference between socially optimal <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties</b> and individually optimal ones by looking at a number of special cases...|$|R

50|$|Most of {{the above}} {{examples}} concern reinsurance contracts that cover more than one policy (<b>treaty).</b> <b>Reinsurance</b> can also be purchased on a per policy basis, in which case it is known as facultative reinsurance. Facultative reinsurance can be written on either a quota share or excess of loss basis. Facultative reinsurance contracts are commonly memorialized in relatively brief contracts known as facultative certificates and often are used for large or unusual risks that do not fit within standard reinsurance treaties due to their exclusions. The term of a facultative agreement coincides with the term of the policy. Facultative reinsurance is usually purchased by the insurance underwriter who underwrote the original insurance policy, whereas <b>treaty</b> <b>reinsurance</b> is typically purchased by a senior executive at the insurance company.|$|E

50|$|A co-insurance, which {{typically}} governs non-proportional <b>treaty</b> <b>reinsurance,</b> is an excess {{expressed as a}} proportion of a claim in percentage terms and applied to the entirety of a claim. Co-insurance is a penalty imposed on the insured by the insurance carrier for under reporting/declaring/insuring the value of tangible property or business income. The penalty is based on a percentage stated within the policy and the amount under reported. As an example: a vessel actually valued at $1,000,000 has an 80% co-insurance clause but is insured for only $750,000. Since its insured value is less than 80% of its actual value, when it suffers a loss, the insurance payout will be subject to the under-reporting penalty, the insured will receive 750000/1000000th (75%) of the claim made less the deductible.|$|E

40|$|Satellite {{insurance}} liabilities for {{a portfolio of}} direct insurance contracts or facultative reinsurance contracts consist largely of unearned premium liabilities, with relatively smaller contributions from reported and unreported losses. As in life insurance, {{there is a high}} probability of loss at launch (birth),and in the early period of operation (infancy), a period of low risk of loss throughout the majority of operation, and a period of high probability of loss {{towards the end of the}} satellite's life. This paper describes the risks covered under a satellite policy and discusses the value of using a simulation model based on an active life approach to estimate the expected losses related to a satellite insurance portfolio's unearned exposure. In addition to providing an estimate of the expected losses, such a model allows for the evaluation and incorporation of the benefits from a reinsurance program protecting the portfolio. This model can also be used to estimate the anticipated benefit from reinsurance protections being considered for the portfolio and to price <b>treaty</b> <b>reinsurance</b> contracts. This paper discusses the concepts underlying the construction of such a model and describes the types of information needed to estimate the model parameters. As part of this discussion, we provide a brief history of the industry and discuss some of the hazards to which satellites are exposed...|$|E

Facultative reinsurance is normally purchased by ceding companies for individual risks not covered, or insufficiently covered, by their <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties,</b> for amounts {{in excess of}} the monetary limits of their <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties</b> and for unusual risks. Underwriting expenses, and in particular personnel costs, are higher for such business because each risk is individually underwritten and administered. However, as they can separately evaluate each risk reinsured, the reinsurer's underwriter can price the contract more accurately to reflect the risks involved. Ultimately, a facultative certificate is issued by the reinsurance company to the ceding company reinsuring that one policy.|$|R

40|$|In many {{branches}} of the insurance business the insurance company is not willing (or not able) to hold the entire risk on its own. There are several types of treaties which an insurance company can use to cede an amount of its claims to another insurance company. A substantial amount of research has been performed to find individually optimal structures {{for each of these}} types of <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties.</b> However only few results exist when the goal is to find optimal combinations of <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties</b> because of computational complexity or non-convexity of the objective functions. In our paper we introduce a novel approach to solve this task. For the first time this problem will be treated like a true multiobjective optimization problem. We apply two state-of-theart MOEAs, the NSGA-II and the ɛ-MOEA and compare their results in our problem setting. The presented approach is flexible with respect to real world modifications concerning risk measurement, cost calculation principles and different combinations of <b>reinsurance</b> <b>treaties.</b> Finally, we do not only solve open mathematical problems on complex reinsurance combinations but we consequently give new heuristic interpretations to supplement existing theoretic results...|$|R
