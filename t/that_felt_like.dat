500|$|The {{first single}} from Matthew West's new album, [...] "My Own Little World" [...] was {{released}} on August 23, 2010. The album, The Story of Your Life, was released October 5, 2010, and according to West, {{is a response to}} thousands of life stories his fans shared with him. [...] "The first day, I got 1,000 stories. All of a sudden, I was like, 'holy cow, something special is about to take place'. I rented a cabin in Tennessee, about 25 minutes from my house <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it was {{out in the middle of}} nowhere. And I spent two months in that cabin reading 10,000 stories," [...] the singer/songwriter reported in an interview with CBN.com. Matthew is also starring in The Heart of Christmas.|$|E
500|$|... "Oh {{it was so}} fun, it was amazing. For me it {{was like}} being on a Martin Scorsese set. I've been so low budget for so long, and to have this {{incredibly}} amazing video was really very humbling. It was really fun, but you'll see if you ever come to a video shoot of mine one day– I'm very private about those things, I don't really talk to everybody. I'm not like the party girl running around. I might even seem to {{be a bit of a}} diva. I'm sort of with myself, in my work head space worrying about costumes, and if extras look right, and placement. I don't just show up for things, you know. That video was a vision of mine. It was Melina the director who wanted to do something, to have a performance art aspect that was so pop but it was still commercial, but <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> lifestyle. It was all those things, I love it." ...|$|E
500|$|Franco did {{extensive}} research for his role. He {{went from being}} a non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, but has since quit the habit. He learned how to ride a motorcycle, play guitar, as well as the conga and bongo drums. The actor also carefully studied Dean's mannerisms by watching his three films (East of Eden, Rebel Without a Cause and Giant). Franco also read numerous biographies on Dean's life. The actor also took advice from some of Dean's closest friends, including Martin Landau, Dennis Hopper, Liz Sheridan (Dean's former girlfriend) and Leonard Rosenman. [...] "Martin was the most informative person that I spoke to. He helped me tremendously with James's physical mannerisms," [...] Franco reflected. [...] "I isolated myself a lot during the filming. I did this because I think he had a pervasive loneliness throughout his life and I wanted to feel what <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like.</b> Not talking to my family or loved ones had quite an emotional effect on me." ...|$|E

500|$|Steve Kandell of New York {{magazine}} {{compared it}} to the second season episode [...] "Hunting Trip", but said [...] "Camping" [...] was [...] "somewhat more of a placeholder". Kandell compared the characters' pressure to meet the city's expectations to those the show faces {{now that they have}} been renewed for a fourth season. ChicagoNow writer Andy Daglas called it [...] "a fun episode, but also one <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> sort of a pause, a chance to reset the pins". He compared the pressure on Leslie {{to come up with an}} idea on the harvest festival to pressure on the show's writing staff to follow up on the harvest festival story arc. The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow called it funny and charming, but also a low point in the season following seven excellent episodes. He said it depended too much on the show's romantic relationships, which he feels are growing stale, although he praised Rashida Jones's performance and the focus on the strong platonic relationship between Leslie and Ron.|$|E
500|$|... "Hold On to Sixteen" [...] {{received}} a mixed reception from reviewers, though {{the music was}} more favorably received. Robert Canning of IGN called it [...] "very underwhelming" [...] and gave it an [...] "okay" [...] rating of 6.5 out of 10; he noted that competition episodes {{such as this one}} spend more time on performance, and deemed the non-performance segments [...] "blase". Rolling Stone Erica Futterman characterized [...] "the moral of this week's story: embrace your youth" [...] as [...] "overkill", but noted that once the competition began, the episode [...] "succeeded in spite of itself". Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times called it a [...] "feel-good episode" [...] that came as a [...] "huge relief" [...] after the show [...] "had lost its moral footing these last few weeks", and AOLTV Crystal Bell said it gave her [...] "some hope {{for the rest of the}} season". Rae Votta of Billboard summarized the episode this way: [...] "Overall, it was a Glee <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> the plots were dealt with as fast as humanly possible to cram in as much singing and dancing as we can." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of the American film Jaws, a {{proposition}} came from the [...] Toho film studio for Nobuhiko Obayashi to develop a similar script. To find inspiration for the story, Obayashi discussed ideas with his pre-teen daughter Chigumi Obayashi. Nobuhiko sought her ideas, believing that adults [...] "only think about things they understand ... everything stays on that boring human level" [...] while [...] "children can come up with things that can't be explained". Several of Chigumi's ideas were included in House such as a reflection in a mirror attacking the viewer, a watermelon being pulled out of a well appearing like a human head, and a house that eats girls. Other themes Chigumi suggested drew upon her own childhood fears. These fears included a pile of futons falling on her <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a monster attacking her, a large loud clock at her grandparents home, and getting her fingers caught in between her piano keys. Nobuhiko shared these story ideas with screenwriter Chiho Katsura. These ideas reminded Katsura of a short story by Walter de la Mare about an old woman who is visited by her granddaughters who then puts them in a trunk.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. John Kubicek of BuddyTV {{called it}} [...] "easily my favorite {{episode of the}} past two seasons, and quite possibly one of the best episodes the show has ever made". Damian Holbrook of TV Guide described it and the episode that followed, [...] "Nationals", as [...] "clever, funny and filled with moments <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> little gifts to the fans who have hung in there". Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson said the [...] "double feature continued the recent hot streak" [...] of episodes, and Michael Slezak of TVLine highlighted this episode's [...] "script that winkingly acknowledged fan complaints that Ryan Murphy & Co. all too often ignore some of Glee original players in favor of new and more-hyped flavors". The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff wrote that it showcased writer and director Ian Brennan's [...] "strengths of acid comedy and sad stories of small-town teenagers who'll never get anything but to sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream"; he gave [...] "Props" [...] a [...] "B" [...] grade. Rae Votta of Billboard said, [...] "It felt organically Glee, zany but with heart." ...|$|E
500|$|Edwards {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{in front of}} the crowd of 153,000 people to celebrate his second victory of the season, earning him $425,675. He was pleased with the result, saying it was [...] "a very special win" [...] and that he felt he was close to the form he had achieved in 2005: [...] "I tried hard to stay calm. And I'm not the best at it sometimes. We all know that." [...] He added, [...] "We do this to win. Winning these races is the greatest. Winning a championship would be the ultimate. What we’re trying to do is win the championship this year. That’s our number-one goal.” Second-place finisher Earnhardt was disappointed, saying he had his car in his chosen position but the red-flag period prevented him from winning the race: [...] "Carl wasn't going to get beat today. He had it in the bag. He was so strong... I was terrible on cold tires. I wish all of you knew what <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like.</b> I hate it." [...] Biffle was philosophical as he argued that he had the fastest car but did not gain the track position he needed to challenge Edwards because he slid on pit road.|$|E
500|$|Hyde {{used the}} digital audio {{workstation}} Pro Tools during the engineering, [...] production, and audio mixing {{stages of the}} album. Slayer members {{wanted to keep the}} use of computer effects to a minimum, only to include a small amount of delay and distortion. As with previous recordings, the drum tracks were recorded first. Drummer Paul Bostaph follows a simple rule suggested by Rubin when in the studio: [...] "The perfect take is the one <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it was going to fall apart but never did." [...] Seven-string guitars were used on the tracks [...] "Scarstruck" [...] and [...] "Here Comes the Pain," [...] the first time Slayer had done so. King was at the B.C. Rich guitar company (manufacturer of his signature model, the KKV) and decided to borrow a seven string guitar. After writing one song, King ordered a seven string as he thought [...] "there's no point having one tuning for just one song," [...] so he wrote another, going on to comment [...] "you don't have to be good to make up a seven-string riff." [...] The album features two songs on seven string guitars, four songs with guitars tuned to Drop-B and all other songs in C# Standard.|$|E

500|$|In April 2016, the ABC-owned {{cable network}} Freeform {{announced}} Marvel's Cloak & Dagger, {{based on the}} characters of the same name, with a straight-to-series order for 2018. The network confirmed that the series would be [...] "its first venture into the Marvel Cinematic Universe", and described the show as a [...] "superhero love story", a premise that Variety called [...] "a seamless fit for Freeform" [...] given the network's target audience of [...] "Becomers" [...] (the 14-34 age demographic). This younger-skewing content was continued with the comedy series Marvel's New Warriors ordered in April 2017, with Freeform executive Karey Burke saying, Marvel [...] "started to see our strength with young adults and together we could create a pipeline for content that was specific to our audience that felt younger than what they're doing at the other channels... It was important {{to both of us}} to find the right characters <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> they would speak directly to Freeform's audience. The Avengers wouldn't work here but the about-to-be-Avengers works here." [...] Loeb noted that it was [...] "exciting" [...] to Marvel [...] "to be able to explore the world of the hero and how it affects someone who {{is trying to figure out}} who they are as opposed to already knows who they are and now their whole life has to take a left. That's the journey we're going on with these kinds of characters" [...] in Cloak & Dagger, New Warriors and Hulu's Runaways. In November 2017, it was announced that New Warriors would no longer air on Freeform and was being shopped to other networks.|$|E
2500|$|Hall {{mentioned}} that achieving a unique {{look for the}} mechanical armor took some time and [...] "just trying to get something <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> {{the personality of the}} character." [...] Co-director Williams stated, [...] "A big part of the design challenge is when he puts on the armor you want to feel that he's a very powerful intimidating presence…at the same time, design-wise he has to relate to the really adorable simple vinyl robot underneath." [...] Baymax's face design was inspired by a copper suzu bell that Hall noticed while at a Shinto shrine.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{publications}} praised Mass Effect: Andromeda for its larger-scale visuals, such as PC Gamer, which wrote, [...] "Andromeda looks stunning. It's out on {{the surface}} of each explorable alien world that the benefit of the Frostbite Engine is most keenly felt, rendering environments at a scale that previous Mass Effect games couldn't match." [...] GameSpot remarked that the game's worlds were [...] "breathtaking to behold and exciting to explore", but also noted that there were too many repetitive, inconsequential quests <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> [...] "padding". RPGamer observed that the game's atmosphere was enhanced by its score, writing, [...] "The music drifts nicely between providing a spacey background in complement to the setting and a rousing up when required, particularly during the final few missions." ...|$|E
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} for Everville has been mixed. The Sun-Sentinel panned Everville as inconsistent and stated <b>that</b> they <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>like</b> its predecessor, it contained too many characters and that [...] "when you weed out the subplots, you find {{there is no}} main plot." ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the 1991 success of Nirvana's Nevermind, {{underground}} music and subcultures were widely noticed in the United States. New distribution networks emerged, touring routes were codified, and regional and independent acts accessed the national stage. Young people across the country became fans of independent music, and punk culture became mainstream. In this new musical climate, the aesthetics of emo also expanded into the mainstream and altered its perception. [...] "Punk rock no-nos like the cult of personality and artistic abstraction suddenly become de rigueur", writes Greenwald. [...] "If one definition of emo has always been music <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a secret, Jawbreaker and Sunny Day Real Estate were cast in the roles of the biggest gossips of all, reigning as the largest influences on every emo band that came after them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} concept art of {{the hotel}} was far more megalithic in scale than what was built. Underwood's original design concept called for a massive six story structure. Tresidder and the board originally had requested a hotel with only 100 guest rooms <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a luxurious country home and not a hotel. The design was changed several times {{and at one point}} was to be no larger than three stories, with a wooden and stone construction. Plans then changed again, to a larger scale. Interior designs and designers had also changed. The husband and wife team of Ackerman and Pope were chosen over artist/interior designer Henry Lovins from Los Angeles. Lovins' interior design renderings, provided by Elizabeth Lovins (Director of the Hollywood Art Center Archive), depict a [...] "Mayan revival" [...] drawing of Hispano-Moresque styling. Historians, Ackerman and Pope created a style that mixed Art Deco, Native American, Middle Eastern, and Arts and Crafts. A lot of decoration originally used was Persian. (Ackerman and Pope actually became consultants in Iran. Pope even has a mausoleum built for him by the Shah.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Eminem also {{addressed}} the mindstate he had {{while working on}} 2009's Relapse saying: [...] "It was interesting, man. I don't know if before Relapse, if we're talking the Infinite album and pre-signing with Dre and all that, from that point on, I don't know if I ever did anything or did much sober at all. Relapse was the first album and first recordings that I did when the lights went on and I was sober. I {{was still trying to}} figure things out...It's interesting. Fun time. I had a fun time." [...] and reiterated his feeling about the album [...] "I felt Relapse was, I don't know. I don't know if people know what I really had to go through {{to be able to make}} Relapse and to be able to write again and to be able to think again and just normal everyday bodily functions and functions in my mind. I don't want to say I wasn't in a place to record again, but I needed time. I needed time to be able to figure out things. I wanted to be able to make my songs feel like something again. I know a lot of stuff on Relapse was comical and funny punchline jokes, but a lot of the songs didn't really feel like anything. I had to go back and listen to some of my older music to try to figure out what I was doing wrong. Once I felt like I figured that out, I started making songs <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> something again." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{comparing}} the 2009 film to its 1972 counterpart, Newsdays Rafer Guzman stated that Iliadis's film contains better [...] "production values" [...] than the 1972 original, but overall {{it keeps the}} [...] "marrow of the story". Guzman suggests {{that some of the}} violence may have ventured too close to hysteria, and that this film is no Virgin Spring—which Guzman reminds that Roger Ebert [...] "famously compared the original to"—but overall the film is [...] "horribly, shamefully satisfying". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune, who disliked the 1972 film and {{went so far as to}} call the original [...] "unstable trash", found the remake to be a better film. Phillips noted that the 2009 film was well written—apart from a couple of moments <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> they belonged in a different movie—well acted, and contains characters that seem like [...] "real people [...] plausible behavior, amid plausible tension, borne of a terrible situation". He also suggests that, contrary to other critic opinion, the 2009 remake does not attempt to follow the current trend of Hostel or Saw-like films simply because audiences are gravitating toward them as of late. Mark Olsen, of the Los Angeles Times, believes the 2009 remake is [...] "deeply misguided refraction of the original". Olsen points to what he feels is the addition of unnecessary back story for the family, and Iliadis's choice to film the rape scene in a [...] "verdant, scenic forest", which gave the sequence an [...] "art-directed falseness, draining the audience-implicating authenticity and replacing it with the easy distance of knowing entertainment". Olsen also felt that changing the trinket Mari holds in the original film to a keepsake from her deceased brother turns the family into [...] "heroic characters" [...] who appear to be [...] "defending their entitlement to a rustic second home and vintage motorboat, not their right to exist".|$|E
2500|$|He {{slowed down}} his {{feelings}} about the album after that saying [...] "I don’t hate Relapse. I don’t hate it at all, but when I’m looking back at an album I do have a tendency, and especially with that album, to run things into the ground. That {{was one of those}} instances where I got in a zone, like, [...] "Yo I just want to be this demented serial killer on this album. And part of that was a growing process to get to Recovery, working through those steps, relearning how to rap, and relearning where I need to be at." [...] He reiterates this statement during his 2013 Q with Rolling Stone saying [...] "I don't hate the record. I want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically, {{but at the same time}} find the right balance between that and making the right songs. And you know, I don't know if I necessarily found that balance yet, because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like [...] "Ha ha this is funny!" [...] You know, walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it. Because when I got sober it was like – I've said this before – but it just was like [...] "Oh shit! I can think straight again!" [...] So I don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs, writing songs <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> something, that brought some kind of emotion. I ran accents into the grounds. I got stuck on that kind of serial killer, crazy vibe and just kind of went with it.|$|E
