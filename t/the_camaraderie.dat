5|$|Benchley {{enrolled}} at Harvard University in 1908, again with Duryea's financial help. He joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity {{in his first}} year, and continued to partake in <b>the</b> <b>camaraderie</b> that he had enjoyed at Phillips Exeter while still doing well in school. He did especially well in his English and government classes. His humor and style began to reveal themselves during this time: Benchley was {{often called upon to}} entertain his fraternity brothers, and his impressions of classmates and professors became very popular. His performances gave him some local fame, and most entertainment programs on campus and many off-campus meetings recruited Benchley's talents.|$|E
5|$|In April 1982, Mandela was {{transferred}} to Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai, Cape Town, along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada, and Raymond Mhlaba; they {{believed that they were}} being isolated to remove their influence on younger activists at Robben Island. Conditions at Pollsmoor were better than at Robben Island, although Mandela missed <b>the</b> <b>camaraderie</b> and scenery of the island. Getting on well with Pollsmoor's commanding officer, Brigadier Munro, Mandela was permitted to create a roof garden; he also read voraciously and corresponded widely, now permitted 52 letters a year. He was appointed patron of the multi-racial United Democratic Front (UDF), founded to combat reforms implemented by South African President P. W. Botha. Botha's National Party government had permitted Coloured and Indian citizens to vote for their own parliaments, which had control over education, health, and housing, but black Africans were excluded from the system; like Mandela, the UDF saw this as an attempt to divide the anti-apartheid movement on racial lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} Siddharth {{was because of}} the sheer {{relevance}} to the character in real life. However, they finalized the choice of the actor only after the script was ready. The choice of Genelia was based on her natural vivacity in real life. This and her eyes, according to Bhaskar, made her an obvious choice for her character. More so, she liked the one line story that Raju told and also a few scenes that he narrated to her. She immediately liked the character and consented for the role. The fact that her co-actor, Siddharth and she acted earlier together in Boys (2003), made them more comfortable to work with. <b>The</b> <b>camaraderie</b> that the lead actors shared during the filming, added to their good performances. The choice of Prakash Raj was easy as he befitted the character he portrayed while, Jayasudha was persuaded {{to play the role of}} the lead actor's mother.|$|E

50|$|In {{the context}} of human relationships, male bonding is used to {{describe}} friendship between men, or {{the way in which}} men befriend each other. The expression is sometimes used synonymously with <b>the</b> word <b>camaraderie.</b> <b>The</b> first widely noticed use of the term was in Men in Groups (1969; 2004) by anthropologist Lionel Tiger.|$|R

Arthor Munday, George Charlmers, Lesley Sinclair, Sue Vanderkelen, Ian Robertson, Helen Lempriere, John Smith, John Busst and Myra Skipper. Percy Leason and his family lived next door {{and then there were the}} many friends who came to join in the work and <b>the</b> <b>camaraderie</b> of the camp.

25|$|The OBPA holds {{a breakfast}} event every Wednesday at a Denny's {{restaurant}} in Oceanside, California. The breakfast starts at 8 am although members start showing up {{as early as}} 6:30 am to get {{a head start on}} the festivities. The group occupies the back room of the restaurant which is decorated with model aircraft hanging from the ceiling and photos of aircraft and pilots lining the walls. Attendees come from communities throughout southern California. Less frequent are visitors from around the world including Germany, Australia, Hungary and South Africa. Some come for <b>the</b> <b>camaraderie</b> while others find relief discussing the rigors of combat with people who have had similar experiences.|$|E
25|$|After World War I, {{veterans}} {{affected the}} Corps and VPI at large, both as new and returning cadets. In 1921, women were admitted to VPI as civilian students and attended classes as day students. The {{next year the}} Corps was reorganized into a regiment of two battalions. Two years later (1923) military service as a cadet was reduced from four years to two; however, {{after two years of}} <b>the</b> <b>camaraderie</b> of Corps life very few cadets chose to convert to civilian student status. During the national rail strike of 1923 the corps again volunteered to the Virginia Governor for active military service. They were not called upon.|$|E

30|$|Six {{experience}} goals {{address the}} issue that enabling human-to-human interaction in organizational events, nurturing organizational heritage, and fostering immediate sharing of success may instill {{a sense of belonging}} to an organization and thus lead to other-focus long-term pride.

25|$|Stargate SG-1 {{takes place}} in a {{military}} science fiction environment and employs the common science fiction concepts of strongly differentiated characters fighting an unequivocally evil enemy (the Goa'uld). However, it links alien races with well-known Earth mythologies, by use of the central Stargate device. Near-instantaneous interplanetary travel allows quick narrative shifts between the politics on Earth and the realities of fighting an interstellar war. Stargate SG-1 gradually evolves the basic premise of the Stargate film into its own unique mythological superstructure, expanding upon Egyptian mythology (notably the gods Apep/Apophis and Anubis as Goa'uld villains), Norse mythology (notably the god Thor as an Asgard ally) and Arthurian legend (notably Merlin as an Ancient ally against the god-like Ori), among others. SG-1 introduces new alien races (as opposed to alien human civilizations) less often than other science fiction television series and integrates newly encountered races or visited planets in stand-alone episodes into its established mythology while leaving the plotlines accessible for new audience members. Despite the show's extensive intergalactic mythology and science fiction elements, scholar M. Keith Booker considered SG-1 ultimately character-driven and heavily dependent on <b>the</b> <b>camaraderie</b> among the SG-1 members.|$|E
500|$|The master for {{the track}} was finally {{completed}} on April 10, 1967, also at Olympic. [...] At this session, the spoken sections and sound effects were recorded {{and the final}} audio mixing took place.

[...] Hendrix biographer and later producer John McDermott notes that it shows <b>the</b> <b>camaraderie</b> enjoyed by the two during {{the early days of}} the Experience.|$|E
500|$|Wish You Were Here is Floyd's {{second album}} with a {{conceptual}} theme written entirely by Roger Waters. [...] It reflects his feeling that <b>the</b> <b>camaraderie</b> that had served the band was, by then, largely absent. [...] The album {{begins with a}} long instrumental preamble and segues into the lyrics for [...] "Shine On You Crazy Diamond", a tribute to Syd Barrett, whose mental breakdown had forced {{him to leave the}} group seven years earlier. [...] Barrett is fondly recalled with lines such as [...] "Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun" [...] and [...] "You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon".|$|E

5000|$|In 1990, the 20th Lancers {{were given}} {{permission}} {{to add the}} suffix Haidri to its title.

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>camaraderie</b> {{among the}} four Beatles was at its highest {{throughout}} this period. A disagreement between McCartney and his bandmates nevertheless resulted in McCartney {{walking out of the}} studio during the final session, for Lennon's [...] "She Said She Said", on 21 June, two days before the band were due to fly to West Germany for the first leg of their world tour. The Beatles spent over 220 hours recording Revolver – a figure that excludes mixing sessions, and compares with less than 80 hours for Rubber Soul. Final mixing of the album took place on 22 June. The Beatles celebrated the project's completion by attending the opening of Sibylla's, a nightclub in which Harrison had a financial stake.|$|E
500|$|In his comics and {{animation}} McCay used stock ethnic stereotypes common in his era. [...] A conscious attempt to offend is not apparent. [...] He depicted blacks as savages, or wishing {{they could be}} white. [...] Most prominent were a pair of characters in Little Nemo: the ill-tempered Irishman Flip and the rarely speaking grass-skirted African Little Imp. [...] In the animated Little Nemo, the Anglo-Saxon Nemo is shown drawn in a dignified Art Nouveau style, and controls by magic the more grotesquely caricatured Flip and Imp. [...] Women were few in McCay's work, and were depicted as superficial, jealous, and argumentative; the Princess in Little Nemo never partook in <b>the</b> <b>camaraderie</b> the males shared.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The New York Times Magazine, Jay Caspian Kang {{outlined}} {{his position}} on the fairness and skill-based aspects of DFS, explaining that [...] "D.F.S., the game itself, is not inherently crooked. Most of the benefits praised by its enthusiasts — the ease of play, <b>the</b> <b>camaraderie</b> among fans, the challenge of solving what amounts to a math puzzle — are real. It does take skill to parse game film, diligently follow the news and interpret the thousands of bits of sports information that are generated each night. If a problem gambler at the poker rooms I frequent in New York City were to hire a programmer and flood the D.F.S. market with his lineups, he would almost certainly hemorrhage money." ...|$|E

500|$|At the age {{of twelve}} in 1894, to his great joy, Wodehouse was able to follow his brother Armine to Dulwich College. He was entirely at home there; Donaldson {{comments}} that Dulwich gave him, for the first time, [...] "some continuity and a stable and ordered life." [...] He loved <b>the</b> <b>camaraderie,</b> distinguished himself at cricket, rugby and boxing, and was a good, if not consistently diligent, student. The headmaster at the time was A.H. Gilkes, a respected classicist, who was a strong influence on Wodehouse. In a study of Wodehouse's works, Richard Usborne argues that [...] "only a writer who was himself a scholar and had had his face ground into Latin and Greek (especially Thucydides) as a boy" [...] could sustain the complex sequences of subordinate clauses sometimes found in Wodehouse's comic prose.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{sense of}} self-seriousness and <b>the</b> <b>camaraderie</b> amongst the {{characters}} were generally cited as positive aspects. Maslin wrote that certain tacky {{elements of the}} film's television roots were outweighed by {{the closeness of the}} Enterprise crew and [...] "by their seriousness and avidity about what seem to be the silliest minutiae [...] That's what longtime Trekkies love about the series, and it's still here—a little the worse for wear, but mostly untarnished." [...] The Los Angeles Times wrote that despite its spectacle, the film's [...] "humanity once again outweighs the hardware, and its innocence is downright endearing". Mackay offered an alternate view, calling the characters' actions and dialogue [...] "wooden" [...] and saying that the film's monsters had more life than the acting. Lloyd's portrayal of Kruge received praise from New Yorks David Denby and The Daily Newss Hunter Reigler.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Stephen Badsey {{wrote that}} Wittmann's {{engagement}} of the spearhead of the 22nd Armoured Brigade group, had overshadowed {{the period between}} D-Day and 13 June in historical accounts. Carlo D'Este wrote that Wittmann's attack was [...] "one {{of the most amazing}} engagements in the history of armoured warfare", Max Hastings called it [...] "one of the most devastating single-handed actions of the war" [...] and Antony Beevor wrote that it was [...] "one of the most devastating ambushes in British military history". Hubert Meyer attributed the failure of Operation Perch to Wittmann's [...] "courage, his tactical and technical abilities and [...] the valor, the expertise and <b>the</b> <b>camaraderie</b> of his Panzer crew". Henri Marie called the attack a [...] "spur of the moment" [...] decision, that showed Wittmann's quick grasp of the possibility of surprising the British but described the action as foolhardy and that other historians had got carried away by Wittmann's ambush; Wittmann lost the first Tiger knocked out in Normandy.|$|E
5000|$|Cox's {{book has}} been praised for the author's [...] "detailed battle accounts, {{descriptions}} of the campaign’s larger strategic implications, and above all, her portrayal of <b>the</b> men’s <b>camaraderie</b> and of <b>the</b> bonds that connected them during their shared coming-of-age experience." [...] Cox drew upon primary sources of the diaries and letters written by the five American soldiers to construct her book.|$|R
50|$|The year 1964 saw {{the gradual}} {{demise of the}} Royal George Hotel as the prime focal venue of the Sydney Push which {{dispersed}} its bustling social life to other traditional venues like the Newcastle, Orient and Port Jackson hotels in The Rocks near Circular Quay and the Rose, Crown and Thistle at Paddington, but also to alternative central-city pubs including the United States and Edinburgh Castle. By the early 1970s, the Criterion Hotel {{on the corner of}} Liverpool and Sussex Streets had become the watering hole of the last of the Push diehards. Meanwhile, Push hangers-on and 'tourists', now numbering hundreds, patronised pubs like the Four-in-Hand (Paddington) and the Forth and Clyde at Balmain, but these were venues of social entertainment, lacking <b>the</b> intellectual <b>camaraderie,</b> <b>the</b> informal folksong and the bohemian flavour of the 'George'.|$|R

500|$|Acting {{gradually}} became {{a passion for}} Hoffman: [...] "I loved <b>the</b> <b>camaraderie</b> of it, the people, and that's when I decided it was what I wanted to do." [...] At the age of 17, he was selected to attend the 1984 New York State Summer School of the Arts in Saratoga Springs, where he met his future collaborators Bennett Miller and Dan Futterman. Miller later commented on Hoffman's popularity at the time: [...] "We were attracted {{to the fact that}} he was genuinely serious about what he was doing. Even then, he was passionate." [...] Hoffman applied for several drama degree programs and was accepted to New York University's (NYU) Tisch School of the Arts. Between starting on the program and graduating from Fairport High School, he continued his training at the Circle in the Square Theatre's summer program. Hoffman had positive memories of his time at NYU, where he supported himself by working as an usher. With friends, he co-founded the Bullstoi Ensemble acting troupe. He received a drama degree in 1989.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Brian Howard of The Journal News {{described it}} as [...] "classic Office" [...] and praised <b>the</b> <b>camaraderie</b> the staff showed {{for each other and}} the [...] "bizarre discomfort" [...] of the double date with Jim, Pam, Phyllis and Bob. Howard described Dwight and Kevin as the episode's stand-outs. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the episode lacked many laugh-out-loud moments, but was effective because the characters are so well developed: [...] "The Office has, over the years, become as much of a kitchen sink drama as it is a comedy. ... The characters are so well-drawn by now, {{and for the most part}} so likable, that a sweet, low-key episode about Michael and the staff bonding over their singlehood worked even without a lot of memorable jokes." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN described the episode as [...] "familiar territory, but it has plenty of fun moments." [...] Fickett praised the scene with Carell and the mystery woman, and Jim and Pam's lunch. But Fickett said the series needed to address why Pam was staying with the company: [...] "Jim and Pam still work there because, well, that's part of the show – but there really isn't a very good reason as to why these two would still be at this dead end job." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{intended}} to be a bottle episode, meaning that it would be an episode that would be based in a single location and help save money, but bad weather plagued production, {{and it was one of}} the toughest episodes of the season for the crew. The episode was shot on location in Lynn Valley, British Columbia, in the Lower Seymour Conservation Reserve, known as the Seymour Demonstration Forest. The atmosphere amongst many of the crew had grown quite tense towards the end of the shooting schedule, and it culminated in a heated argument between director Joe Napolitano and first assistant director Vladimir Steffof, after which Napolitano did not appear on location again. [...] "Darkness Falls" [...] was [...] the last episode of the series that Napolitano directed. The weather delayed production at the site so much that pick-up shots and inserts had to be filmed at a later date to finish the episode. Delays were also caused by the inaccessibility of the location, as only generators, camera equipment, and first aid crew were able to stay on-site, and time was wasted commuting staff in each day. Jason Beghe, who played Ranger Larry Moore, was a childhood friend of David Duchovny and helped convince him to pursue an acting career. <b>The</b> <b>camaraderie</b> between the two actors is said to have helped lighten the mood during the episode's difficult production.|$|E

5000|$|The {{film was}} panned by most {{mainstream}} critics and has 31% on Rotten Tomatoes. Janet Maslin of The New York Times stated, [...] "On the one hand, this obviously talented film maker celebrates all the aggrandizing {{features of the}} genre: the laconic tough talk, <b>the</b> manly <b>camaraderie,</b> <b>the</b> proud posturing, the power of walking tall past the awestruck citizenry of a prairie town. On the other hand, [...] "Posse" [...] does its best to reject and avenge what it regards as the flagrant distortions of the past." [...] Roger Ebert described it as [...] "an overdirected, overphotographed, overdone movie that is so distracted by its hectic, relentless style that the story line is rendered almost incoherent." [...] And Entertainment Weekly gave it a C+ {{and said it was}} [...] "a glossy, kinetic pastiche of Western conventions." ...|$|R
