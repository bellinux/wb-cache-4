500|$|... #1's is {{the first}} {{compilation}} album released by recording group Destiny's Child through Columbia Records on October 25, 2005. It marked their last album before a formal disbandment in late 2005, announced during the tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It. The greatest hits album features the highest-charting singles from Destiny's Child's four studio albums released between 1998 and 2004 {{as well as a}} song from their remix album This Is the Remix released in 2002. In addition to already existing material, three new songs were recorded for the compilation—"Stand up For Love", [...] "Feel <b>the</b> <b>Same</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> Do" [...] and group member Beyoncé's collaboration with Slim Thug, [...] "Check on It".|$|E
500|$|The {{music on}} the album was noted to be {{contemporary}} R, pop and new age soul music; Sputnikmusic's John Hanson further described it as [...] "filled" [...] with bubblegum R pop. In addition to already released material, new songs were also recorded for the album, including [...] "Stand Up for Love", Beyoncé's [...] "Check on It" [...] featuring Slim Thug and [...] "Feel <b>the</b> <b>Same</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> Do". [...] "Stand Up for Love" [...] was written by David Foster, his daughter Amy Foster-Gillies and Beyoncé while its production was handled by both Foster and Humberto Gatica. The ballad was inspired by poverty-stricken children and families which receive funds from charitable organization. [...] "Check on It" [...] was originally written by Beyoncé, Slim Thug, Angela Beyince and Sean Garrett for The Pink Panther 2006 soundtrack but was included on the compilation album and during the closing credits of the aforementioned film. It was later included on the track list of the international deluxe edition of Beyoncé's second studio album B'Day (2006). Slim Thug raps his lines backed by a bassline, while Beyoncé's vocals, further described as [...] "R pipes" [...] by Bret McCabe from the Baltimore City Paper, received comparisons to Donna Summer. A dance beat {{is present in the}} song along with quick hooks sung by Beyoncé. [...] "Feel <b>the</b> <b>Same</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> Do" [...] was described as a track similar to soul songs by American group The Supremes instrumentally complete with [...] "exotic" [...] strings. Jess Harvell from Pitchfork Media felt its sound was suitable for Mariah Carey's The Emancipation of Mimi (2005).|$|E

Patrick is [...] "enormously entertaining to portray" [...] because, according to Fagerbakke, [...] "when I'm performing Patrick, there are many secrets that I could never divulge". Fagerbakke's approach in voicing Patrick is [...] "much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> would do [...] any kind of character." [...] "I'm always looking for opportunities to explore that freewheeling imagination and insanity of children. To be able to plug in to that and let that carry you in to a performance is such a gas, I have so much fun with that. I love kids; I raised two girls and I love being a parent," [...] he said. The cast members record as a whole cast. Fagerbakke says that the situation improves his performance as a voice actor because [...] "there is something remarkable that happens when people are working together that is unique to that." [...] Fagerbakke modeled his performance whenever Patrick is angry after that of American actress Shelley Winters.|$|E

500|$|The {{tour was}} chronicled in the {{documentary}} titled I'm Going to Tell You a Secret. Originally called The Re-Invented Process {{in reference to the}} tour and the exhibition X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS, the documentary was filmed during Madonna's visit to North America and Europe from May 24 to September 14, 2004. It was directed by Jonas Åkerlund, whose previous endeavors included music videos, commercials and the cult film, Spun (2003). The documentary emerged from Madonna's urge to show her artistic side on the tour and her devotion towards the Jewish mysticism Kabbalah. Unlike her 1991 documentary, , which portrayed Hollywood glamour, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret clarified from its beginning that it was about the singer's views on life and spirituality. [...] "It's a different me, I have a husband, I have a family, my whole life has changed. It would be pretty strange if I was behaving <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> did 12 years ago— that would be a little freaky.

500|$|In the off-season, it was speculated {{by many in}} {{the media}} whether Luongo should remain Vancouver's captain, citing the added {{pressure}} of the goaltending position. After the Canucks' 3–1 series deficit in the second round, Luongo ceased to make himself available for pre-game interviews – a customary practice for goaltenders, but not for captains. When asked after the Canucks' elimination whether he thought he should remain team captain, he told reporters he did not think it was an issue. However, Gillis, who appointed him captain two seasons prior, asserted it was a topic to be addressed in the off-season. On September 13, 2010, Luongo confirmed he was stepping down, stating that [...] "Serv as captain...in a Canadian city for a team with such passionate fans is a privilege and an experience I will always take pride in. I {{will continue to be a}} leader on this team and support my teammates <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> always have while focusing on our ultimate goal." [...] Centre Henrik Sedin, who won the Hart Trophy for the 2009–10 season, was named Luongo's successor in a pre-game ceremony to the Canucks' season-opener.|$|E
500|$|One of Jolie's {{requests}} was {{to rework}} the third act, which originally had Salt rescue {{his wife and son}} from a coalition of villains, because she did not believe a mother would neglect her child in this kind of situation. Wimmer decided to then make Salt more crucial to the villain's schemes, and add a sequence where Salt breaks into [...] "a place harder than Fort Knox" [...] – after considering Camp David, Wimmer settled on the White House. When asked if the script written for Cruise was the same for Jolie, he said [...] "I think that it’s just been a continual process, obviously accelerating by changing the central character. But the ideas – the locomotive of ideas that drive the film are the same. An undercover CIA operative is accused of being a Russian mole, and has to go on the run to defend himself. That’s been the same since day one. The tone of the film has changed in this evolution. In <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> guess, as – you know – action thrillers have changed {{along the lines of the}} Bond films and the Bourne films".|$|E

2500|$|During {{this time}} Ramblin' Jack Elliott studied {{extensively}} under Guthrie, visiting {{his home and}} observing how he wrote and performed. Elliott, like Bob Dylan later, idolized Guthrie and was inspired by his idiomatic performance style and repertoire. Because of Guthrie's Huntington's disease, Dylan and Guthrie's son Arlo later claimed they learned much of Guthrie's performance style from Elliott. When asked about Arlo's claim, Elliott said, [...] "I was flattered. Dylan learned from me <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> learned from Woody. Woody didn't teach me. He just said, If {{you want to learn}} something, just steal it—that's the way I learned from Lead Belly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regarding his {{religious}} beliefs, Carolla has stated, [...] "I am not agnostic. I am atheist. I don't {{think there is}} no God; I know there's no God. I know there's no God <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> know many other laws in our universe. I know there's no God and I know most of the world knows that as well. They just won't admit it because there's another thing they know: they know they're going to die, and it freaks them out. So most people don't have the courage to admit there's no God and they know it. They feel it. They try to suppress it. And if you bring it up they get angry because it freaks them out." ...|$|E

2500|$|Levy {{and many}} others have {{supported}} Dylan {{in the context of}} a larger, older blues and folk tradition of songwriters evolving old songs into new ones, which Dylan was no stranger to in the 1960s. Pete Seeger himself has previously expressed the view that Dylan is a link in this chain of folk and blues songwriters. Seeger has spoken many times about the folk process, often recounting that his friend Woody Guthrie once said to him [...] "That guy stole that from me, but I steal from everybody". Ramblin' Jack at one time expressed similar sentiments: [...] "Dylan learned from me <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> learned from Woody. Woody didn't teach me. He just said, 'If you want to learn something, just steal it—that's the way I learned from Lead Belly'".|$|E
2500|$|Searching for the Young Soul Rebels was {{released}} to positive reviews from music critics. Melody Maker named {{it one of}} the best albums of 1980 in its year-end list, while NME named it the tenth best album of the year. David Hepworth, however, reviewing the album in Smash Hits, was dismissive and felt that [...] "potentially good songs are dragged down by mannered vocals and would-be epic arrangements". Calling it [...] "a weird record", Robert Christgau wrote: [...] "Never have soul horns sounded remotely as sour, and Kevin Rowland can't carry a tune to the next note. There are horn interjections that make me laugh out loud at their perfectly timed wrong rightness, and with Kevin Rowland quavering through his deeply felt poesy and everybody else blaring away, I enjoy it in much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> enjoy a no wave band on a good night".|$|E

Sales for Bryant's replica jersey fell significantly from their previous highs. However, in September 2004, the assault case was dropped by prosecutors after the accuser refused {{to testify in}} the trial. Afterward, Bryant agreed to apologize to her for the incident, including his public mea culpa: [...] "Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now {{that she did not}} and does not view this incident <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter."
