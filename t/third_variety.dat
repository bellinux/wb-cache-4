60|$|In a <b>third</b> <b>variety</b> of {{this type}} the human-headed body is united at the waist with the {{shoulders}} of a bull's body, in which it terminates. This occurs on an early vase. (Brit. Mus., No. 452.) On the coins of Oeniadæ in Acarnia, and on those of Ambracia, all of the period after Alexander the Great, the Achelous has a bull's body, and head with a human face. In this variety of the type the human element is almost absorbed, as in the first variety cited above, the coin of Metapontum, the bull portion of the type is only indicated {{by the addition of}} the horns and ears to the human head. On the analogy between these, varieties in the type of the Achelous and those under which the metamorphoses of the marine goddess Thetis are represented, see Gerhard, Auserl. Vasenb. ii. pp. 106-113. It is probable that, in the type of Thetis, of Proteus, and also of the Achelous, the singular combinations and transformations are intended to express the changeful nature of the element water.|$|E
60|$|If I {{am right}} in believing that allied or {{representative}} species, when inhabiting a continuous area, are generally so distributed that {{each has a}} wide range, with a comparatively narrow neutral territory between them, in which they become rather suddenly rarer and rarer; then, as varieties do not essentially differ from species, the same rule will probably apply to both; and if we in imagination adapt a varying species to a very large area, we shall have to adapt two varieties to two large areas, and a <b>third</b> <b>variety</b> to a narrow intermediate zone. The intermediate variety, consequently, will exist in lesser numbers from inhabiting a narrow and lesser area; and practically, as far as I can make out, this rule holds good with varieties {{in a state of}} nature. I have met with striking instances of the rule in the case of varieties intermediate between well-marked varieties in the genus Balanus. And it would appear from information given me by Mr. Watson, Dr. Asa Gray, and Mr. Wollaston, that generally when varieties intermediate between two other forms occur, they are much rarer numerically than the forms which they connect. Now, if we may trust these facts and inferences, and therefore conclude that varieties linking two other varieties together have generally existed in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect, then, I think, we can understand why intermediate varieties should not endure for very long periods;--why as a general rule they should be exterminated and disappear, sooner than the forms which they originally linked together.|$|E

60|$|Some highly {{porphyritic}} though coarse-grained masses, evidently of sedimentary origin, {{and divided}} into thin layers, differing {{from each other}} chiefly {{in the number of}} embedded grains of quartz, interested me much from the peculiar manner in which here and there some of the layers terminated in abrupt points, quite unlike those produced by a layer of sediment naturally thinning out, and apparently the result of a subsequent process of metamorphic aggregation. In another common variety of a finer texture, the aggregating process had gone further, for the whole mass consisted of quite short, parallel, often slightly curved layers or patches, of whitish or reddish finely granulo-crystalline feldspathic matter, generally terminating at both ends in blunt points; these layers or patches further tended to pass into wedge or almond-shaped little masses, and these finally into true crystals of feldspar, with their centres often slightly drusy. The series was so perfect that I could not doubt that these large crystals, which had their longer axes placed parallel to each other, had primarily originated in the metamorphosis and aggregation of alternating layers of tuff; and hence their parallel position must be attributed (unexpected though the conclusion may be), not to laws of chemical action, but to the original planes of deposition. I am tempted briefly to describe three other singular allied varieties of rock; the first without examination would have passed for a stratified porphyritic breccia, but all the included angular fragments consisted of a border of pinkish crystalline feldspathic matter, surrounding a dark translucent siliceous centre, in which grains of quartz not quite blended into the paste could be distinguished: this uniformity {{in the nature of the}} fragments shows that they are not of mechanical, but of concretionary origin, having resulted perhaps from the self-breaking up and aggregation of layers of indurated tuff containing numerous grains of quartz,--into which, indeed, the whole mass in one part passed. The second variety is a reddish non-porphyritic claystone, quite full of spherical cavities, about half an inch in diameter, each lined with a collapsed crust formed of crystals of quartz. The <b>third</b> <b>variety</b> also consists of a pale purple non-porphyritic claystone, almost wholly formed of concretionary balls, obscurely arranged in layers, of a less compact and paler coloured claystone; each ball being on one side partly hollow and lined with crystals of quartz.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The physiological, anatomical, {{morphological}} and ultrastructural {{characteristics of}} the three varieties occidentiales, lamourouxii and turbinata of the genus Caulerpa racemosa collected from the Mediterranean Sea at Abu Qir bay, Alexandria, Egypt were investigated. The {{results showed that the}} three varieties have similar characteristics in some physiological aspects. The urease enzyme is the constitutive enzyme and responsible for urea-degradation; the mechanism by which C-urea was taken was the active transport; the 14 contents of the amino and fatty acids and the composition of free and protein hydrolysates were comparable; the amount of radiations determined in each of the cell constituents was almost constant, except for carbohydrates. The morphological studies using scanning electron microscope showed a great variation among all varieties, the anatomical structure of the stolons were greatly similar. Similarity in shape and size of mitochondria, chloroplasts, nucleus and some characteristic deposits in filament and in cell vacuoles was evident among the second and <b>third</b> <b>varieties.</b> The occidentiales and lamourouxii varieties were similar in cell wall structure, while starch granules were similar in all varieties. The two varieties occidentiales and lamourouxii seems to be more related to each other than to the turbinata variety. Combination of morphological criteria with those of physiological, anatomical and ultrastructure aspects are more useful in plant identification and confirmation...|$|R
