40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} report on our {{participation}} in the mixed monolingual web task of the 2005 Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF). We compared the result of web page retrieval based {{on the content of}} <b>the</b> <b>page,</b> <b>the</b> target domain and <b>the</b> <b>page</b> content, and a combination of <b>the</b> <b>page</b> title and <b>the</b> target domain. The result shows that combining <b>the</b> <b>page</b> title and <b>the</b> target domain resulted in better retrieval performance than using only <b>the</b> <b>page</b> content or <b>the</b> target domain and <b>the</b> <b>page</b> content. ...|$|R

5|$|Alan {{receives}} {{a call from}} a man purporting to be Alice's kidnapper, demanding <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> of Departure in exchange for her. Meeting at a state park, Alan is about to turn over <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> when the man is consumed by a dark tornado and Alan is knocked out. He awakes in Barry and Dr. Hartman's care in the lodge overlooking Cauldron Lake. Dr. Hartman listens to Alan's story, and believes he is suffering a psychotic break; everything that he's witnessed being part of his imagination. Alan attempts to escape the lodge as the shadowy force starts to attack it; while running, Alan finds evidence that Dr. Hartman is aware of the supernatural events surrounding the lake. Barry helps Alan to escape the lodge before the shadow subsumes it and all those inside. Returning to town, they find the FBI have arrived, and attempt to arrest him, before the shadowy forces intervene, allowing Alan and Barry to escape.|$|E
5|$|Cornelis Suijk—a former {{director}} of the Anne Frank Foundation and president of the U.S. Center for Holocaust Education Foundation—announced in 1999 {{that he was in the}} possession of five pages that had been removed by Otto Frank from the diary prior to publication; Suijk claimed that Otto Frank gave these pages to him shortly before his death in 1980. The missing diary entries contain critical remarks by Anne Frank about her parents' strained marriage and discuss Frank's lack of affection for her mother. Some controversy ensued when Suijk claimed publishing rights over the five pages; he intended to sell them to raise money for his foundation. The Netherlands Institute for War Documentation, the formal owner of the manuscript, demanded <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> be handed over. In 2000 the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science agreed to donate US$300,000 to Suijk's foundation, and <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> were returned in 2001. Since then, they have been included in new editions of the diary.|$|E
5|$|Data {{is written}} to the flash memory in units called pages (made up of {{multiple}} cells). However, the memory can be erased only in larger units called blocks (made up of multiple pages). If the data in some of <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> of the block are no longer needed (also called stale pages), only <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> with good data in that block are read and rewritten into another previously erased empty block. Then the free pages left by not moving the stale data are available for new data. This is a process called garbage collection (GC). All SSDs include some level of garbage collection, but they may differ in when and how fast they perform the process. Garbage collection {{is a big part}} of write amplification on the SSD.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Paging</b> Supervisor (part of the {{operating}} system) manages all memory, both real and virtual, moving pages between real memory and disk as needed, keeping <b>the</b> <b>Page</b> Table updated, servicing memory allocation requests, and cleaning up after itself. As the load on the system increases, a page can be referenced when all page frames are in use. When this happens, <b>the</b> <b>paging</b> supervisor typically identifies <b>the</b> <b>page</b> {{that has not been}} read or written for the longest interval of time (least-recently used), copies <b>the</b> <b>page</b> to <b>the</b> <b>paging</b> file (on disk), updates <b>the</b> <b>Page</b> Table, and uses <b>the</b> newly available <b>page</b> frame to satisfy the memory request.|$|R

5|$|Drake is a playable {{character}} in PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale. Nathan's rival {{in the game}} is Sly Cooper, the reason being that Drake found pages of Sly's book the Thievius Racoonus and {{at the start of}} his storyline was on a desert island with Sully similar to that found on Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. When Drake reaches the boss arena, he starts to decipher <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> of the Thievius Racoonus, then Sly appears and explains he's the rightful owner of <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> that Nathan possesses. Drake refuses and Sly mocks his abilities in an attempt to intimidate him, as a result Drake responds insultingly and the two battle. After defeating the boss in the game, Nathan returns to the same island as before and using the All-Star Power he obtained from the boss, he greatly enhanced Sully's plane, as the screen turns to black, Drake randomly says 'I punched a chicken'.|$|E
5|$|I Love Bees {{was first}} advertised by a hidden {{message in a}} Halo 2 trailer; players who {{investigated}} the titular website discovered that <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> appeared to be hacked by a mysterious intelligence. As players solved puzzles, audio logs were posted to the ilovebees.com site which gradually revealed more of the fictional back-story, involving a marooned artificial intelligence stranded on Earth and its attempts to put itself back together. 250,000 people viewed the ilovebees website when it was launched in August 2004, and more than 500,000 returned to the site every time <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> were updated. More than three million visitors viewed the site {{over the course of}} three months, and thousands {{of people around the world}} participated in the game.

50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>page</b> {{is loaded}} in memory {{at the time}} the fault is generated, but is not marked in the memory {{management}} unit as being loaded in memory, then it is called a minor or soft <b>page</b> fault. <b>The</b> <b>page</b> fault handler in the operating system merely needs to make the entry for that <b>page</b> in <b>the</b> memory management unit point to <b>the</b> <b>page</b> in memory and indicate that <b>the</b> <b>page</b> is loaded in memory; it does not need to read <b>the</b> <b>page</b> into memory.

50|$|The {{flowchart}} provided {{explains the}} working of a TLB. If it is a TLB miss, then the CPU checks <b>the</b> <b>page</b> table for <b>the</b> <b>page</b> table entry. If the ‘present bit’ is set, then <b>the</b> <b>page</b> is in main memory, and the processor can retrieve the frame number from <b>the</b> <b>page</b> table entry {{to form the}} physical address. The processor also updates the TLB to include <b>the</b> new <b>page</b> table entry. Finally, if the present bit is not set, then <b>the</b> desired <b>page</b> {{is not in the}} main memory and a page fault is issued. Then a page fault interrupt is called which executes <b>the</b> <b>page</b> fault handling routine.|$|R

However, <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> of the book soon scatter across London and Palethorn gains a demon-like appearance as a result. The spell Palethorn casts once again brings Sir Daniel Fortesque, who was resting at a nearby museum, back to life.

50|$|This {{part of the}} {{operating}} system creates and manages <b>page</b> tables. If <b>the</b> hardware raises a <b>page</b> fault exception, <b>the</b> <b>paging</b> supervisor accesses secondary storage, returns <b>the</b> <b>page</b> that has <b>the</b> virtual address that resulted in <b>the</b> <b>page</b> fault, updates <b>the</b> <b>page</b> tables to reflect the physical location of the virtual address and tells the translation mechanism to restart the request.|$|R
50|$|Page {{tables are}} used to {{translate}} the virtual addresses seen by the application into physical addresses used by the hardware to process instructions; such hardware that handles this specific translation is often known as the memory management unit. Each entry in <b>the</b> <b>page</b> table holds a flag indicating whether <b>the</b> corresponding <b>page</b> is in real memory or not. If it is in real memory, <b>the</b> <b>page</b> table entry will contain the real memory address at which <b>the</b> <b>page</b> is stored. When a reference is made to a <b>page</b> by <b>the</b> hardware, if <b>the</b> <b>page</b> table entry for <b>the</b> <b>page</b> indicates {{that it is not}} currently in real memory, the hardware raises a page fault exception, invoking <b>the</b> <b>paging</b> supervisor component of the operating system.|$|R
