5|$|I. atherfieldensis, {{described}} by R.W. Hooley in 1925, was smaller and less robust <b>than</b> <b>I.</b> bernissartensis, with longer neural spines. It was renamed Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis in 2007. The Bernissart specimen RBINS 1551 {{was described as}} Dollodon bampingi in 2008, but McDonald and Norman returned Dollodon to synonymy with Mantellisaurus.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of times}} rather than {{time-out}} and I've got times rather <b>than</b> <b>I</b> call time {{appears to have}} been influenced by older forms such as kings and I've got kings X. There was also one report of times X. Similarly derivatives of time-out are often accompanied by the traditional crossed fingers.|$|E
5|$|I. lakotaensis was {{described}} by David B. Weishampel and Philip R. Bjork in 1989. The only well-accepted North American species of Iguanodon, I. lakotaensis {{was described}} from a partial skull from the Barremian-age Lower Cretaceous Lakota Formation of South Dakota. Its assignment has been controversial. Some researchers suggest {{that it was more}} basal <b>than</b> <b>I.</b> bernissartensis, and related to Theiophytalia, but David Norman has suggested that it was a synonym of I. bernissartensis. Gregory S. Paul has since given the species its own genus, Dakotadon.|$|E

5|$|These were {{difficulties}} {{which seemed}} rather {{to require the}} superior force of a Wycherley, or a Congreve, than of a raw and unexperienced pen; for I believe I may boast that none ever appeared so early upon the stage.

5|$|What {{were the}} {{possibilities}} which thus presented themselves? Firstly, in that {{of making a}} film not noticeably similar to any previously made in the English language.

Thirdly, that of making a picture which paid no regard whatever to established, although not practised, moral convention.|$|E

5|$|Whether it {{involved}} {{the history of}} the number zero or the invention of the transistor, two things stood out to me.

40|$|Despite {{their ability}} to perform better <b>than</b> CEM <b>I,</b> {{available}} data have shown that cement combination concetes have been under-utilised in construction. To investigate the permeation resistance of cement combination concrete, this paper examined the sorptivity of CEM I and some binary and ternary cement concretes containing fly ash and silica fume at equal water/cement ratios and strengths. At equal water/cement ratio, fly ash binary cement concretes have higher sorptivity <b>than</b> CEM <b>I</b> and while their sorptivity increased with increasing content of fly ash, they decreased with curing age. Silica fume binary and ternary cement concretes have lower sorptivity <b>than</b> CEM <b>I</b> and fly ash binary cement concretes at both early and later ages and their sorptivity reduced with increasing content of silica fume. At equivalent strengths, cement combination concretes generallyhave lower sorptivity <b>than</b> CEM <b>I</b> and they reduced with increasing total content of the cement additions...|$|R

25|$|Based on its smaller dorsal and caudal fins, the largetooth cookiecutter shark is {{believed}} to be less active <b>than</b> <b>I.</b> brasiliensis and an overall weak swimmer. Much of its body cavity is occupied by an enormous oil-filled liver, which allows it to maintain neutral buoyancy in the water column with little effort. Unlike I. brasiliensis, this shark possesses binocular vision, which may allow it to target its prey with greater precision. Virtually nothing is known of its biology; it is presumed to be aplacental viviparous.|$|E

25|$|After some {{search for}} the girl, I interviewed a nightclub dancer who had just scored in a small {{emotional}} part in a play that did not run (The Noose).

40|$|Clover {{seedlings}} {{were grown}} at different nitrogen concentrations (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 mM NO(3) (-) i. e.

Net photosynthetic rate (P (N)), photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE), leaf chlorophyll (Chl) content, maximum photochemical efficiency (F(v) /F(m)), and actual photochemical efficiency of photosystem 2 (PS 2) (Phi(PS 2)) increased from N(5) to N(15) and decreased with N(15) to N(25).
