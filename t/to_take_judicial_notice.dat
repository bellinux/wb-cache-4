5000|$|In the United States, Article II of the Federal Rules of Evidence ("FRE") {{addresses}} {{judicial notice}} in federal courts, and {{this article is}} widely copied by U.S. States. FRE 201(b) permit judges <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> of two categories of facts: ...|$|E
50|$|The FRE {{also notes}} that {{judicial}} notice may be permissive or mandatory. If it is permissive, then the court may choose <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> of the fact proffered, or may reject the request and require the party to introduce {{evidence in support of}} the point. If it is mandatory, then the court must take judicial notice of the fact proffered. Although the FRE does not expand upon the kinds of facts that would fall into one category or another, courts have ruled that judicial notice must be taken of federal public laws and treaties, state public laws, and official regulations of both federal and local government agencies.|$|E
50|$|Occurring {{under the}} {{presidency}} of John Tyler, Prigg v. Pennsylvania weakened the enforcement mechanisms of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 by allowing states to forbid their officials from cooperating in the return of fugitive slaves — but by asserting federal government authority and responsibility over the area of fugitive slave return, it {{set the stage for}} future more stringent laws which would bypass the states (such a law was later passed in 1850). Also, by refusing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> any <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> of the problem of the kidnapping of free blacks into slavery, the decision established an implicit precedent that blacks were entitled to fewer procedural protections than whites.|$|R
50|$|The sole {{exception}} to the no-evidence rule is that a court may <b>take</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> of certain things. For example, the court can <b>take</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> of commonly known facts not reasonably subject to challenge such as the Gregorian calendar or of public records such as a published legislative report showing {{the intent of the}} legislature in enacting a particular statute.|$|R

5000|$|Next, the Court of Appeals {{acknowledged}} that on appeal both parties had requested judicial notice of facts {{contained within the}} record of a parallel proceeding, involving different plaintiffs, in a Nigerian Court. The Court of Appeals referred to the Nigerian litigation as Zango v. Pfizer (“Zango litigation”). The Zango litigation had recently been dismissed in Nigeria. The court declined <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> of the [...] "Zango litigation", instead opting to vacate the district court’s dismissal on grounds of forum non conveniens and remanding {{the case to the}} district court to consider the implications of the [...] "Zango litigation" [...] on its forum non conveniens analysis.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a matter}} known to all persons of common {{intelligence}} {{in the state of}} Oklahoma that the Governor takes the position that legal executions are judicial murder; and that he refuses to permit them to be carried into effect, upon the ground that he would thereby become a party thereto; and that he has expressed his fixed determination to strictly adhere to this policy until the expiration of his term of office. As this is a capital conviction, and as the Governor's action presents an absolute bar to the enforcement of the law in Oklahoma, we cannot, without a failure to discharge our duty, omit <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> of, and pass upon, this position of the Governor, as unpleasant as it is for us to do so. If we remained silent, the Governor and the people would have the right to think that the courts acquiesced in the position which he has assumed, when {{as a matter of fact}} nothing is further from the truth. We therefore cannot avoid deciding this matter.|$|E
40|$|In Maine v. Norton, Maine {{and several}} Maine {{business}} associations filed suit challenging the {{decision made by}} the Department of the Interior to list the distinct population segment (DPS) of Gulf of Maine Atlantic salmon as endangered. Upon cross-motions for summary judgment, the court established that the listing decision was based upon the best scientific data available and clearly supported by the administrative record. The court granted defendant 2 ̆ 7 s motion and, accordingly, the listing decision was upheld. This case presented to the federal court the decision whether to dismiss the Plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 motions for lack of standing or, alternatively, to determine whether listing the DPS of Gulf of Maine Atlantic salmon was accurate and lawful under the Endangered Species Act. Although the Maine court chose to dismiss the Maine business associations 2 ̆ 7 motion, the court took judicial notice of the facts necessary to establish standing by the State of Maine, noting {{the importance of the}} issues to be determined in this case. This application of rule 201 of the Federal Rules of Evidence enabled the court to make a detailed determination of the issues raised by this listing decision. The question now becomes: was this an appropriate application of judicial notice under Federal Rule 201 ? This Note reviews the purpose of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and the roles that both the State and federal agencies have played throughout the process of listing the DPS of Gulf of Maine Atlantic salmon. The Note considers the elements required <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> under the Federal Rules of Evidence, and the court 2 ̆ 7 s authority to utilize this adjudicative procedure. Further, this Note weighs the Maine court 2 ̆ 7 s application of Rule 201 to this case, and concludes that the decision <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> in order to establish standing by Plaintiff, the State of Maine, was judicious and well-timed, considering the current economic climate of the State and the continued threats to the survival of the wild Maine salmon population...|$|E
50|$|One special {{category}} {{of information in}} this area includes things of which the court may <b>take</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>notice.</b> This category covers matters that are so well known that the court may deem them proved without the introduction of any evidence. For example, if a defendant {{is alleged to have}} illegally transported goods across a state line by driving them from Boston to Los Angeles, the court may <b>take</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> {{of the fact that it}} is impossible to drive from Boston to Los Angeles without crossing a number of state lines. In a civil case, where the court <b>takes</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> of the fact, that fact is deemed conclusively proved. In a criminal case, however, the defense may always submit evidence to rebut a point for which <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> has been <b>taken.</b>|$|R

40|$|The Guantánamo {{prosecution}} of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the alleged mastermind behind the deadly USS Cole bombing, highlights an unresolved issue in military commissions: whether the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution applies to bar hearsay statements of unavailable witnesses. While al-Nashiri 2 ̆ 7 s counsel recently moved {{for the military}} judge <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> that the Confrontation Clause applies, it is worth considering that the question may be framed differently. Rather than ask whether the Confrontation Clause applies in a military commission, we may ask whether a 2 ̆ 2 testimonial statement 2 ̆ 2 - {{the only kind of}} hearsay evidence that triggers the Confrontation Clause-is a concept consistent with wartime tribunals. This Article proposes that a testimonial statement is a uniquely civilian concept, situating military commissions outside the scope of the Confrontation Clause. The military commission trying al-Nashiri nonetheless preserves the constitutional value of reliability while offering different procedural protections than are offered in federal courts, such as admitting hearsay statements from witnesses made unavailable by war...|$|E
40|$|The Internet is {{a temptation}} which many courts {{have been unable}} to resist. Over the past twenty years, judges at trial and appellate levels have {{increasingly}} used Internet research in crafting their judicial opinions. Judge Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit is a huge proponent of this proposition, and in August 2015, he authored an opinion which took this independent Internet research to a new level. In Rowe v. Gibson, Judge Posner 2 ̆ 7 s opinion reversed summary judgment for a pro se litigant partly based on independent Internet research performed by the court. His justification for using this Internet research was due to the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s lack of resources as a pro se litigant. Rowe, a prisoner, was not knowledgeable enough to build a proper record by himself, and {{he did not have the}} resources to hire his own attorney. As such, he was unable to avoid summary judgment. Judge Posner argued that a court 2 ̆ 7 s careful use of Internet research would assist pro se litigants whose cases are in danger of being dismissed due to procedural failure. Judge Posner is correct that pro se litigants are at a severe disadvantage with regard to procedure in a courtroom. He is also correct that a court must be free to use information from the Internet in litigation. This Article proposes a way to allow judges to use Internet research as a form of judicial notice, as well as to assist pro se and underrepresented litigants have their day in court. First, courts must develop a standardized way to consider pro se litigants 2 ̆ 7 pleadings. Many courts construe pro se litigants 2 ̆ 7 pleadings liberally, but have little regulation for this proposition. By using a factor-balancing approach, a court may determine which litigants are the most deserving of lowered pleading standards. These litigants will also potentially benefit from judicial Internet research. Next, a court may consider taking judicial notice of facts on the Internet. These facts and websites consulted must meet the standards of the Federal Rules of Evidence for accuracy and reliability. If a pro se litigant is flagged as vulnerable based on the first part of the test, a court has the ability <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> of certain facts in early stages of the proceedings. This test tracks with the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s desire to not allow pro se litigants to become an underrepresented class in court. In Rowe, Judge Posner 2 ̆ 7 s sentiment was admirable, but still not an entirely permissible use of judicial Internet research. In order for a court to be able to assist pro se litigants to create opportunities for their cases to go to trial, it must use Internet research according to specific rules. Only then can pro se litigants get a fair chance in court...|$|E
