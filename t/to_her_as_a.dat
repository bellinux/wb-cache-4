5|$|According to some later accounts, {{before the}} {{eruption}} of the Peloponnesian War (431 BC404 BC), Pericles, some of his closest associates (including the philosopher Anaxagoras and sculptor Phidias) and Aspasia faced a series of personal and legal attacks. Aspasia, in particular, was reportedly accused of corrupting the women of Athens {{in order to satisfy}} Pericles' perversions. According to Plutarch, she was put on trial for impiety, with the comic poet Hermippus as prosecutor. The historical nature of the accounts about these events is disputed, and apparently no harm came <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result.|$|E

5|$|As {{time goes}} by, Rumpelstiltskin and Belle develop a strong bond with each other. After {{a few months}} of living with him, Belle asks the dark one why she found children's {{clothing}} upstairs. Rumpelstiltskin tells her it belonged to his son whom he unfortunately lost along with his wife. Gaston arrives to take Belle back but Rumpelstiltskin turns him into a rose and presents it <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> gift. When asked about Gaston, Belle says that it was an arranged marriage, not one of love. She left him because she wanted to be heroic and there are not many chances for women to be heroic. Rumpelstiltskin asks Belle to go into town to buy more straw, and she cannot believe he trusts her to come back. Rumpelstiltskin says he does not expect to see her again.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth {{ordered the}} Burmese Ruby Tiara in 1973, {{and it was}} made by Garrard & Co. using stones from her private collection. It is {{designed}} {{in the form of}} a wreath of roses, with silver and diamonds making the petals, and clusters of gold and rubies forming the centre of the flowers. A total of 96 rubies are mounted on the tiara; they were originally part of a necklace given to her in 1947 as a wedding present by the people of Burma (now Myanmar), who credited them with having the ability to protect their owner from sickness and evil. The diamonds were also given <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> wedding present, by the Nizam of Hyderabad and Berar, who possessed a vast jewellery collection of his own.|$|E
5|$|No {{official}} canonization {{procedures have}} begun for Richard, though the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lafayette began collecting testimonials about reputed help obtained through her in 1991. Unlike the traditional support for canonization of a saint, which begins with popular devotion {{and is only}} later recognized by the Church, support for Richard began outside her immediate home area and was first promoted by the clergy, beginning with Brennan, Crowley, and Calais. The bishop of the Lafayette diocese {{at the time of}} her death, Maurice Schexnayder, visited her grave multiple times and referred <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> saint. Another bishop of the diocese, Harry Flynn, presided at the thirtieth anniversary mass in 1989, along with sixteen other priests. The diocese also approved the creation of a private organization, the Friends of Charlene, to spread her story.|$|E

Amos has said that her {{maternal}} grandparents each had an Eastern Cherokee grandparent of their own; of particular importance <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> child was her maternal grandfather, Calvin Clinton Copeland, who was {{a great source of}} inspiration and guidance, offering a more pantheistic spiritual alternative to her father and paternal grandmother's traditional Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Following her husband's death, Constanze {{recovered}} from her despair and addressed {{the task of}} providing financial security for her family; the Mozarts had two young children, and Mozart had died with outstanding debts. She successfully appealed to the Emperor on 11 December 1791 for a widow's pension due <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of Mozart's service to the Emperor as a part-time chamber composer. Additionally, she organized a series of concerts of Mozart's music and the publication of many of her husband's works. As a result, Constanze became financially secure over time.|$|E

25|$|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang did not, however, restart {{her film}} career or launch a career {{for her in}} episodic {{television}} despite several guest-starring roles in , Marcus Welby, M.D., Branigan and The Men From Shiloh. Even the pilot Prudence and the Chief, which was a spoof on The King and I, did not get picked up as a TV series. In addition, musicals were now failing {{at the box office}} and that avenue was closed <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, she returned almost exclusively to the musical stage, appearing in only a few more films and TV productions.|$|E
25|$|Herod had {{to lease}} back the royal estate at Jericho from Cleopatra, after Mark Antony {{had given it}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> gift. After their joint suicide in 30 BC, Octavian assumed control of the Roman Empire and granted Herod {{absolute}} rule over Jericho, {{as part of the}} new Herodian domain. Herod's rule oversaw the construction of a hippodrome-theatre (Tell es-Samrat) to entertain his guests and new aqueducts to irrigate the area below the cliffs and reach his winter palaces built at the site of Tulul Abu el-Alaiq (also written Alayiq). In 2008 the Israel Exploration Society published an illustrated volume of Herod's third Jericho palace.|$|E

Peter reveals that he is in a relationship with Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold), the mother of Phil's granddaughter and Ian's niece, Lexi Pearce. Phil threatens Ian and forces him to end the relationship. Ian tells Peter this, and Peter tells Ian that he has found £10,000 that Cindy stole from Phil. They return the money, and Phil blames Ian, believing that he put Cindy up to stealing it. In January 2014, just as Ian is about to propose to Denise, Jane arrives unannounced. Jane later buys into Ian's restaurant and they begin running it together, leading Ian to harbour feelings for Jane.|$|E
60|$|With this youth Ellen Langton became familiar, {{and even}} intimate; {{for he was}} her only companion, of an age suited <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own, and the {{difference}} of sex did not occur <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> objection. He was her constant companion on all necessary and allowable occasions, and drew upon himself, in consequence, {{the envy of the}} college.|$|R
5000|$|Later on, Keiichi also {{temporarily}} and involuntarily {{hosted the}} familiar/angel hybrid Blue Lance (then unnamed). She chose Keiichi <b>as</b> <b>her</b> host {{because he was}} the only person who referred <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> [...] "angel" [...] and not <b>as</b> <b>a</b> “former devil".

25|$|Modern {{scholars}} have proposed {{the town of}} Currium or Curria, Quirinus, *quir(i)s or *quiru, the Sabine word for spear and curia. The *quiru- would design the sacred spear that gave the name to the primitive curiae. The discovery at Sulmona of a sanctuary of Hercules Curinus lends support to a Sabine origin of the epithet and of the cult of Juno in the curiae. The spear could also be the celibataris hasta (bridal spear) that in the marriage ceremonies was used to comb the bridegroom's hair as a good omen. Palmer views the rituals of the curiae devoted <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> reminiscence {{of the origin of}} the curiae themselves in rites of evocatio, practise the Romans continued to use for Juno or her equivalent at later times as for Falerii, Veii and Carthage. Juno Curitis would then be the evoked deity after her admission into the curiae.|$|E
25|$|Most of Twelver Shia criticize Abu Bakr because, after Muhammad's death, Abu Bakr {{refused to}} grant Muhammad's daughter, Fatimah, {{the lands of}} the village of Fadak which she claimed her father had given <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> gift before his death. He {{refused to accept the}} {{testimony}} of her witnesses, so she claimed the land would still belong to her as inheritance from her deceased father. However, Abu Bakr replied by saying that Muhammad had told him that the prophets of God do not leave as inheritance any worldly possessions and on this basis he refused to give her the lands of Fadak. However, as Sayed Ali Asgher Razwy notes in his book A Restatement of the History of Islam & Muslims, Muhammad inherited a maid servant, five camels, and ten sheep. This proves that prophets can receive inheritance, and can pass on inheritance to others as well.|$|E
25|$|The Tiara {{immediately}} {{brings them}} to the World of Sleeping Beauty. The three fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather, provide gowns and outfits for the trio, but Kilala's dress turns into that of a maid and is forced {{to work at the}} castle's party for Princess Aurora's 17th birthday. Kilala helps Prince Phillip's little cousin find a glass bead. When they do find it, the little princess gives it <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> token for her help. Sylphy laughs at Kilala for being naïve and unsuitable to be a real princess. Princess Aurora finds Kilala on the balcony and tells her to keep on believing in herself and her love for Rei. Maleficent appears (disguise as Lady Malecent) and attempts to curse Aurora with magic rose thorns. Kilala shields the princess and falls under the spell. Rei breaks Maleficent's magic with true love's kiss. Right after Maleficent is defeated, the glass bead turns into a rose quartz and joins with the Tiara.|$|E
5000|$|Her first {{mathematical}} publication was {{an article}} on perfect numbers for Scientific American.
