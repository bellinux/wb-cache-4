Given the rank of Lieutenant, he was posted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> School of Physical Training at Frankston, Victoria, {{to act as a}} divisional supervisor of physical training. The exertion of the job aggravated his chronic muscular problems, diagnosed as fibrositis.

5|$|A {{prototype}} Mark 2 {{was tested}} and proven on 8 April 1918, {{and the gun}} was scheduled to go into naval service in 1923.

Before the war was over, on March 13, 1865 Raynolds was brevetted to brigadier general for meritorious service.|$|E

Vizzini came to {{an agreement with the}} Army Commission to delegate the responsibilities to him. He collected a poll tax on the animals whose owners wanted to avoid requisition.
