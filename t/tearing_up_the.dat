25|$|The {{difference}} that Martí established between prose and poetry are conceptual. Poetry, as he believes, is {{a language of}} the permanent subjective: the intuition and the vision. The prose is an instrument and a method of spreading the ideas, and has the goal of elevating, encouraging and animating these ideas rather than having the expression of <b>tearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> heart, complaining and moaning. The prose is a service to his people.|$|E
25|$|To {{manage this}} rapid growth, Opelika was {{incorporated}} as a town on February 9, 1854, then within Russell County. As {{a result of}} Opelika's transportation infrastructure, many warehouses for storing cotton and other goods were built. With {{the onset of the}} Civil War these warehouses were converted to Confederate supply depots. In 1864 and 1865, Union raids commanded by Lovell Rousseau and James H. Wilson attacked Opelika, <b>tearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> railroads and destroying all government property, including Opelika's warehouses.|$|E
25|$|On December 28, 2011, UC Berkeley bulldozed {{over the}} west end of People's Park, <b>tearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> decades-old {{community}} garden and plowing down mature trees in what a press release issued by the school described as an effort to provide students and the broader community with safer, more sanitary conditions. This angered some Berkeley students and residents, who noted that the bulldozing took place during winter break when many students were away from campus, and followed the administration-backed police response at Occupy Cal which occurred less than two months prior.|$|E

25|$|On September 12, 2013, a ten-alarm fire swept {{from the}} Funtown Pier northward. The fire is {{believed}} to have started under the boardwalk, below the Kohr's Kustard stand {{at the southern end of}} the pier. The wind pushed it northward, and fire crews were able to make a stand at Lincoln Avenue by <b>tearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> newly replaced boardwalk which was destroyed less than a year before by Hurricane Sandy. Jack & Bill's Bar and Kohr's Kustard were two businesses that were both destroyed in the 1955 and 2013 fires.|$|E
25|$|To his sister, he gave {{good advice}} and {{promises}} of help {{if she and}} her husband could escape from Paris. The émigrés who followed him pertinaciously were refused audience, or when they forced themselves on him, were peremptorily denied all help. Leopold was too purely a politician not to be secretly pleased at the destruction of the power of France and of her influence in Europe by her internal disorders. Within six weeks of his accession, he displayed his contempt for France's weakness by practically <b>tearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> treaty of alliance made by Maria Theresa in 1756 and opening negotiations with Great Britain to impose a check on Russia and Prussia.|$|E
25|$|The Polish king Sigismund III and {{his successors}} of the Vasa dynasty — Władysław IV Vasa and John II Casimir Vasa — {{collected}} many rich {{works of art}} in the castle, such as oriental fabrics, tapestries, and numerous paintings by such famous artists as Titian, Veronese, Jacopo, Leandro Bassano, Tintoretto, Palma il Giovane, Antonio Vassilacchi, Tommaso Dolabella, Guercino, Guido Reni, Joseph Heintz, Bartholomeus Spranger, Roelant Savery, Rembrandt, Pieter Soutman, Peter Danckerts de Rij, Peter Paul Rubens, Jan Brueghel the Elder, Daniel Seghers, Georg Daniel Schultz and sculptures by Giambologna, Giovanni Francesco Susini and Adriaen de Vries. These splendid works of art were either destroyed or plundered during the invasions of Poland by Sweden and Germans of Brandenburg during (The Deluge, in 16551657). The Swedes and Germans took all the priceless pictures, furniture, tapestries, the royal library, the crown archive, numerous sculptures, whole floors and royal flags. In the castle they had a military Lazareth field hospital, which additionally contributed to the devastation of the buildings. A few months later armies destroyed the rest, plundering most of the copper elements and <b>tearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> rest of castle's floor.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{arriving}} {{across the}} river from Point of Rocks the Rangers found the village held by two companies of Federal infantry and two companies of cavalry {{in the form of the}} Loudoun Rangers, totaling 350 Federals in all. One of the companies of infantry inhabited Patton's Island in the middle of the Potomac, while the second occupied a small fort on high ground above the C Canal. The Loudoun Rangers were encamped in the village. Mosby immediately set to work clearing Patton's Island in preparation for crossing the river. He deployed Ranger Sam Chapman with his lone howitzer on the bluff above the river bank and ordered a detachment of sharpshooters under Lt. Albert Wrenn to wade into the river and attack the Federal position on the island. The Federal infantry exchanged fire with the Rangers for several minutes before giving way to the combined rifle and artillery fire and fled to the Maryland shore, <b>tearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> small bridge over the canal as they crossed it. The Rangers then dashed {{across the river}} to the Maryland shore where they began exchanging fire with the Federals across the canal. Many of the Rangers immediately set about repairing the bridge using planking from an old building. As soon as it was complete the Rangers ran across, led by Henry Hatcher who ran into the Union camp under heavy fire and captured its flag. Once across the canal the Rangers quickly drove the Federals from the town.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} debuted on March 27, 2011. The music video {{begins with a}} young Porcelain Black being teased {{by a group of}} blonde girls, who {{resemble}} [...] "The Plastics" [...] in Mean Girls (2004). As Porcelain Black is being teased, a young version of Lil Wayne comes to the defense of Porcelain Black, scaring away the group of blonde girls. The video then fast forwards nine years where Black, accompanied by her own entourage, walks past a group of snobby girls, giving them the middle-finger as she walks away leaving them in shock. As the video continues, Black gets revenge on her high school enemies by <b>tearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> school's library and cafeteria. During Lil Wayne's verse, the two are seen raging in the school's gym. Rapper Birdman makes a cameo appearance in this scene.|$|E
500|$|King Charles II patronised Cresswell's establishments, as he {{did those}} of Madam Damaris Page; he {{declared}} Cresswell's to be [...] "a Sound organisation". She became as well known as the politicians of her time, largely shielded from legal proceedings by her extensive London network of clients across the court, the guilds and government. Her increasing immunity from prosecution furthered her stature as a hate figure, particularly with the many thousands of London apprentices who could not afford her bawds, and bound {{by the terms of}} their contracts, were forbidden to marry. The houses of Cresswell and Page were a target for the 1668 Bawdy House Riots that swept London. Starting on Shrove Tuesday, the rioting lasted for five days, as young apprentices burnt and smashed the royally supported brothels. To some, the brothels symbolised Charles's continental style court: licentious and awash with unaffordable debauchery. The apprentices attacked her [...] "cathouse" [...] in Moorfields, assaulting the women, <b>tearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> bedding, looting the property and destroying the building.|$|E

500|$|... "You Got Me" [...] was {{released}} {{as a single}} on August 26 with a live acoustic version of [...] "Sad Savior" [...] as the B-side. The group went on a US fall tour in October and November with support from The Maine and Bad Rabbits. On November 7, a music video {{was released}} for [...] "You Got Me". The video begins with the band wondering about Reyes whereabouts, before shifting to Reyes dancing on an empty stage. The idea for it was proposed by the group's tour manager. Cooper said: [...] "Back before we even started touring, we’d go out to clubs on Long Island together and Eddie [...] would be <b>tearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> dance floor ... {{is by far the}} best dancer of the band." [...] On March 21, 2012, a music video was released for [...] "This Is All Now". Directed by Greg Hunter and Josh Romero of Dionysian Entertainment, they had shot the footage during the previous summer and created a music video with it. The group was so impressed they selected it as an official video. In April, the band toured Australia with New Found Glory and This Time Next Year. Between June and August, they were one of the headliners of the 2012 edition of Warped Tour.|$|E
500|$|The {{tour was}} met with high praise from critics. Ashley Zimmerman from the New Times Broward-Palm Beach called the opening night of the tour [...] "memorable", {{describing}} the set by Thirty Seconds to Mars as [...] "a bit like a party", during which lead vocalist Jared Leto provided [...] "raw and beautiful vocals". She further wrote that co-headliner Linkin Park played a [...] "great mix {{of old and new}} songs" [...] that was able to please those who brought the band to fame, while still showcasing the newest work. Jay Cridlin of the Tampa Bay Times commented that the two bands made Steinbrenner Field's return to concert a [...] "smashing spectacle" [...] creating a [...] "powerful, festival-like feeling". He felt that Thirty Seconds to Mars delivered a [...] "fully committed performance", praising the band's energy on stage, and noticed the [...] "futuristic" [...] production of the show by Linkin Park. Alison Angel, writing for Creative Loafing Charlotte, opined that the tour offered fans a chance to catch [...] "three big rock bands" [...] on a single event and felt that each performance was a [...] "sight to behold". She further said, [...] "between AFI <b>tearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> stage before the headliners even appeared, to the theatrics in Thirty Seconds to Mars' act and the grand performance of hard-rocking Linkin Park, fans walked out with a sense that this moment was truly once in a lifetime." [...] Danny Crandall of The Sun Chronicle commented that Linkin Park [...] "blitzed through an intense, head-bobbing" [...] set, while Thirty Seconds to Mars played a [...] "rousing performance" [...] high on audience interaction.|$|E

On the occasion of his visit to Australia in 1938, the Sydney Labor Daily published a cartoon showing Kaiser Wilhelm <b>tearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Belgian Neutrality Pact, Adolf Hitler tearing up another agreement, and Luckner tearing up a directory, with the caption [...] "They All Have the Habit".|$|E

2500|$|Many in America {{were not}} happy with the draft-card burners, or with the {{frequent}} depiction of them in the media.

All of our young people are not <b>tearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> flag. All of our youth are not supporting North Vietnam and carrying Viet Cong flags." [...] In October 1967 at a rally in support of the government a news photograph was snapped of a man kissing his draft card, his girlfriend smiling at his side. In Playboys November 1967 issue, Playboy Playmate Kaya Christian wrote that her [...] "turn-offs" [...] were [...] "hypocrites" [...] and [...] "draft card burners".|$|E
2500|$|Kobach {{was married}} on June 23, 2001 to Heather Mannschreck, a former {{environmental}} systems engineer {{who now has}} a part-time photography business in addition to homeschooling their five daughters. Kobach, his wife, and their children live on their farm near LeCompton, north of Lawrence, Kansas. Their residence is in a building, the permits for which Kobach originally received lower taxation and permitting fees due to claimed intent for agricultural exemptions, rather than residential use. He stated he intends to build a residential home on the property. When building it, Kobach [...] "closed in" [...] the plumbing and electric work {{so it was not}} possible for the building inspector to examine it without <b>tearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> floor and removing walls that covered wiring. There was no septic system or water source. Despite those difficulties, he was granted permit waivers by the county administration, precipitating public controversy.|$|E

[...] The single turret of the new class contained one 11" [...] Dahlgren in addition to the 15". [...] On January 27, 1863 the monitor USS Montauk, three gunboats, and a mortar schooner again engaged the fort. Commander John L.

[...] Likewise, thirteen hits scored by the fort's artillery did little beside denting the monitor's plate and sink a small launch. [...] The defenders simply repaired the damaged earthworks during the night.|$|E
2500|$|Anti-vehicle {{barriers}} {{along the}} inner German border grew increasingly impenetrable throughout its existence. In the early days, the East Germans blocked border crossings by simply <b>tearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> road surface, digging ditches {{and using the}} earth and rubble to build ramparts that physically blocked the carriageways. These were then enhanced with wire and wooden posts. As border fortifications developed into permanent barriers, purpose-built obstacles became standard. The most common types were Czech hedgehogs (Panzersperre) or cheval de frise (Stahligel or [...] "steel hedgehogs"). These anti-vehicle devices were constructed from three or four pairs of [...] rails welded {{together to form a}} steel obstacle weighing over – heavy enough to stop a motor vehicle from pushing them aside. Distributed at intervals narrow enough to prevent even the smallest East German vehicle, such as Trabants, from passing between them, they became a common sight along the entire inner German border and the Berlin Wall.|$|E
2500|$|Weston {{began the}} 1917 college {{football}} {{season as a}} second substitute quarterback for Fielding H. Yost's University of Michigan football team. Cliff Sparks started {{the first two games}} as Michigan's quarterback, with Lowell Genebach as his substitute. Sparks was injured in the second game of the season, and Yost gave Weston the start against Mount Union College. Weston seized the opportunity and put on an offensive display that attracted national attention. On the second play of the game, Weston [...] "straight-armed and dodged the entire Mount Union team, running sixty-five yards for a touchdown." [...] Weston scored a total of five touchdowns in the first two quarters and led the Wolverines to a 69-0 win over Mount Union. Following the game, one newspaper called him a [...] "sensation" [...] under the headline: [...] "Yost Discovers Star Performer.""Weston celebrated his first day of play on a Michigan varsity team by <b>tearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> enemy so fast that [...] had to quit giving himself the ball -- he made so many gains that he was wearing out his team making them keep up with him." ...|$|E
