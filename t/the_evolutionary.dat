5000|$|<b>The</b> High <b>Evolutionary</b> {{appears in}} Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H., voiced by Corey Burton. At {{some point in}} the future, a gamma meteor struck Earth when the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. weren't around. This caused {{humanity}} to regress back to the primitive times until <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary</b> was able to be their salvation by turning them into Animal Men. When the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. arrived in this time in the episode [...] "Future Shock" [...] thanks to Leader tricking Skaar into going into a temporal distortion wormhole, they end up attacked by some Lizard Men until <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary</b> arrived where he explained what happened to Earth. Afterwards, <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary</b> traps <b>the</b> Hulk in an energy cage and devolves the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. <b>The</b> High <b>Evolutionary</b> retreats with Hulk upon finding that Skaar can't be devolved. Upon some advice from Leader (who is trapped on bathroom duty after tricking Skaar), Skaar leads the devolved teammates into finding <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary's</b> lair. At his lair, <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary</b> uses his Evolution Chamber to evolve Hulk into a smarter appearance that has bat-like wings. When Skaar and the devolved teammates attack <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary's</b> lair, <b>the</b> evolved Hulk turns on <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary</b> stating that he would be superior to <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary.</b> Skaar and Hulk fought <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary</b> after Skaar had evolved Red Hulk in the evolution chamber. After A-Bomb and She-Hulk are evolved, <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary</b> devolved Hulk back to his own original state. Skaar ends up destroying <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary's</b> staff where its power regresses <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary</b> to a baby which ends up in the care of the arriving Lizard Men. The Agents of S.M.A.S.H. then return to their own time {{to make sure that they}} get back to Earth and prevent the gamma meteor from impacting Earth. They succeed in destroying the gamma meteor in the episode [...] "Enter the Maestro" [...] with the unlikely help of Maestro which prevents <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary's</b> future from happening.|$|R

Captain America also appeared on the scene, where he had overcame his transformation after the tree-like creatures had been summoned to battle, and fought for Lowtown. Vision saved Scarlet Witch from Luminous, while Doctor Voodoo heavily damaged <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary.</b> Quicksilver delivered <b>the</b> final blow to <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary,</b> who fled Counter-Earth with Luminous.|$|R

However, the team has disbanded and abandoned their headquarters, leaving its computers to assemble an ad hoc team of inactive reservists: The Captain, the Falcon, Hercules, the Beast, and the Hulk. Yellowjacket (Rita DeMara) answers the summons (which she received via the communications equipment she stole from her predecessor) and is allowed to join the team.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>evolutionary</b> {{biologist}} Richard Dawkins {{described himself}} as a neo-Paleyan in The Blind Watchmaker (1986), where he argued, following <b>the</b> <b>evolutionary</b> biologist and humanist Julian Huxley, that Paley's watch analogy fails to recognise the difference between the complexity of living organisms and that of inanimate objects. Living organisms can reproduce themselves, so they can change to become more complex from generation to generation. Inanimate objects such as watches are unable to pass on any changes, so they never become more complex unless a watchmaker redesigns them. The comparison breaks down, in Dawkins's view, because of this important distinction.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> High <b>Evolutionary</b> has {{appeared}} in the 2015 Uncanny Avengers series. He has apparently created a new Counter-Earth, no longer inhabited by humans but instead by millions of New Men. <b>The</b> High <b>Evolutionary</b> routinely exterminates <b>the</b> entire population of New Men when they ultimately fail to meet his standards of perfection and then re-creates them. He was served in his plans by a human called the Master Scientist and Luminous (a female who was created from the genetic templates of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch while also having the same abilities as them). A human called <b>the</b> Low <b>Evolutionary</b> was one of a few humans living on Counter-Earth who opposed <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary.</b> After being tracked down and defeated by Luminous, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch were brought to <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary</b> himself. He revealed to them that Django and Marya Maximoff were their true parents. He also told them the truth where they were supposedly not mutants, but they had been experimented on by <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary.</b> <b>The</b> High <b>Evolutionary</b> later confronted <b>the</b> Avengers Unity Division when they interfered with his plan to destroy Lowtown (a refuge for a resistance formed by <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary's</b> rejects, led by <b>the</b> Low <b>Evolutionary).</b> He was defeated after Doctor Voodoo unleashed upon him the thousands of souls of those he had exterminated and was forced to flee through a portal with Luminous.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{earliest}} phases of its construction, <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary's</b> Counter-Earth was aggressively targeted for [...] "collection" [...] by the Beyonders (not {{to be confused}} with the Beyonder). Agents of the Beyonders manipulated Adam Warlock into murdering <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary</b> to allow theft of Counter-Earth, but he was revived by Moondragon and Warlock's counterpart, Her. When <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary</b> discovered <b>the</b> disappearance of Counter-Earth, alongside the Thing, Alicia Masters, Starhawk, Moondragon, and Her, <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary</b> pursued <b>the</b> Beyonders to rescue his world. When <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary</b> arrived at <b>the</b> Beyonders' planet museum, he himself reported that his mind snapped when he witnessed the scope of their powers and how effectively insignificant he was compared to these alien beings. It is this encounter that marks the beginning of <b>the</b> High <b>Evolutionary's</b> mental instability.|$|R

5|$|Aside {{from this}} {{immediate}} effect, the case represented a clear {{recognition that the}} Australia Act 1986 finally and completely ended all legal ties between the United Kingdom and Australia, and that Australia has been a fully independent and sovereign nation {{in its own right}} since at least 3 March 1986, when the Act came into force. Some commentators have criticised <b>the</b> <b>evolutionary</b> approach adopted by the court, and the court's resultant failure to find a certain date on which Australia became independent, arguing that the distinction is more than merely symbolic and could have real consequences. However, even Justice Callinan, who questioned <b>the</b> <b>evolutionary</b> approach in this case, affirmed in a later case (Attorney-General Western Australia v Marquet) that the effect of the Australia Act in finally recognising independence could not be doubted.|$|E
5|$|Because DNA {{collects}} mutations over time, {{which are}} then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer <b>the</b> <b>evolutionary</b> history of organisms, their phylogeny.

A chaotic fight ensues, with the prisoners, Sun Girl, Mark and the New Warriors forming an impromptu team that manages to defeat the small army of Evolutionaries through their diverse and very different powers and abilities.|$|R
5|$|Early {{fish from}} the fossil record are {{represented}} {{by a group of}} small, jawless, armored fish known as ostracoderms. Jawless fish lineages are mostly extinct. An extant clade, the lampreys may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish. The first jaws are found in Placodermi fossils. The diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate <b>the</b> <b>evolutionary</b> advantage of a jawed mouth. It is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force, improved respiration, or a combination of factors.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{studies of}} {{globular}} clusters {{can also be}} used to determine changes due to the starting composition of the gas and dust that formed the cluster.

Recent years have been fruitful for the discovery of several dinosaurs related to ancestors of Triceratops. Zuniceratops, the earliest known ceratopsian with brow horns, was described in the late 1990s, and Yinlong, the first known Jurassic ceratopsian, in 2005.|$|E
