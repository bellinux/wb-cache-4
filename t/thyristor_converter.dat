5000|$|One of {{the last}} major uses of mercury arc valves was in HVDC power transmission, where they were used in many {{projects}} until the early 1970s, including the HVDC Inter-Island link between the North and South Islands of New Zealand and the HVDC Kingsnorth link from Kingsnorth power station to London. However, starting about 1975, silicon devices have made mercury-arc rectifiers largely obsolete, even in HVDC applications. The largest ever mercury-arc rectifiers, built by English Electric, were rated at 150-kV, 1800 A and were used until 2004 at the Nelson River DC Transmission System high-voltage DC-power-transmission project. The valves for the Inter-Island and Kingsnorth projects used four anode columns in parallel, while those of the Nelson River project used six anode columns in parallel {{in order to obtain}} the necessary current rating.

40|$|AbstractThyristor {{electric}} drives {{of the rolling}} mills {{are known to be}} the most power-intensive consumers at the iron and steel works. Obviously, significant losses of electric power are connected with consumption of reactive power that depends on the value of the reserve of rectified EDV of the <b>thyristor</b> <b>converter.</b> The paper mentions characteristic dynamic modes providing a maximum reserve of the rectified EDV. It estimates the influence of the rectified EDV on the value of reserve for overcorrection in the impact-loading mode. Experiments have proven the impact of the network voltage deviation in amount of 10 – 12 % decreasingly. The reserve of the rectified EDV has been divided into components. The paper provides a defined concept for generation of the power-saving systems of two-region speed control based on the principles of rearranging the reserve of the rectified EDV in the steady state and dynamic modes. It considers the method and system of two-region dependent speed control {{as a function of the}} rectified EDV of the <b>thyristor</b> <b>converter.</b> The system is proved to provide a constant reserve of the rectified EDV of the <b>thyristor</b> <b>converter</b> within the load range of the electric drive that is lower than the rated one.
