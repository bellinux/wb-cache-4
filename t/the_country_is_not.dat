25|$|In {{what became}} known as the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 24 August – 3 October 1572, Catholics killed {{thousands}} of Huguenots in Paris. Similar massacres took place in other towns in the weeks following. The main provincial towns and cities experiencing the Massacre were Aix, Bordeaux, Bourges, Lyons, Meaux, Orleans, Rouen, Toulouse, and Troyes. Nearly 3,000 Protestants were slaughtered in Toulouse alone. The exact number of fatalities throughout <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known. On 23–24 August, between about 2,000 and 3,000 Protestants were killed in Paris and between 3,000 and 7,000 more in the French provinces. By 17 September, almost 25,000 Protestants had been massacred in Paris alone. Beyond Paris, the killings continued until 3 October. An amnesty granted in 1573 pardoned the perpetrators.|$|E

25|$|Chenin blanc (known also as Pineau de la Loire {{among other}} names) {{is a white}} wine grape variety from the Loire Valley of France. Its high acidity means {{it can be used}} to make {{everything}} from sparkling wines to well-balanced dessert wines, although it can produce very bland, neutral wines if the vine's natural vigor is not controlled. Outside the Loire it is found in most of the New World wine regions; it is the most widely planted variety in South Africa, where it is also known as Steen. The grape may have been one of the first to be grown in South Africa by Jan van Riebeeck in 1655, or it may have come to that country with Huguenots fleeing France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Chenin blanc was often misidentified in Australia as well, so tracing its early history in <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> easy. It may have been introduced in James Busby's collection of 1832, but C. Waterhouse was growing Steen at Highercombe in Houghton, South Australia by 1862.|$|E
25|$|In {{sites such}} as Angkor, tourism is inevitable. Therefore, the site {{management}} team cannot exclusively manage the site. The team has to manage the flow of people. Millions of people visit Angkor each year, making the management of this flow vital to the quickly decaying structures. Western tourism to Angkor began in the 1970s. The sandstone monuments and Angkor are not made {{for this type of}} heightened tourism. Moving forward, UNESCO and local authorities at the site {{are in the process of}} creating a sustainable plan for the future of the site. Since 1992, UNESCO has moved towards conserving Angkor. Thousands of new archaeological sites have been discovered by UNESCO, and the organization has moved towards protected cultural zones. Two decades later, over 1000 people are employed full-time at the site for cultural sensitivity reasons. Part of this movement to limit the impacts of tourism has been to only open certain areas of the site. However, much of the 1992 precautionary measures and calls for future enforcement have fallen through. Both globally and locally the policy-making has been successful, but the implementation has failed for several reasons. First, there are conflicts of interest in Cambodia. While the site is culturally important to them, Cambodia is a poor country. Its GDP is marginally larger than Afghanistan’s. Tourism is a vital part to the Cambodian economy, and shutting down parts of Angkor, the largest tourist destination in <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> an option. A second reason stems from the government’s inability to organize around the site. The Cambodian government has failed in organizing a robust team of cultural specialists and archaeologists to service the site.|$|E

2500|$|Reinhardt's {{majority}} opinion {{is grounded in}} details specific {{to the case of}} California and supported by a narrow Constitutional principle.

William Eskridge, writing at the Stanford Law Review, described the courts as being [...] "unable, and usually unwilling, to strongly challenge entrenched inequalities", and went on to suggest that while California may be ready to embrace same-sex marriage, <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> and as a result, the Supreme Court would be [...] "wise to deny review ... or to go along with Judge Reinhardt's narrow ruling." [...] Jane S. Schacter, writing at the Harvard Law Review, framed the opinion in terms of an incremental, federalist approach to securing LGBT rights. Schacter and many other commentators also suggested that Reinhardt's decision may be deliberately directed at Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is widely regarded as a swing vote in any Supreme Court decision on the case.|$|E

In 1961, Diệm suggested the second 5-year plan (1962–1966) to continue the first 5-year plan. During the first Republic of Vietnam, some indigenous industrial zones or factories were founded, such as: paper factory Cogido in An Hảo (1961), Textile factories Vinatexco and Vimytex, glassware factory Khánh Hội, Cement factories Hà Tiên and Thủ Đức, Hydroelectric power factory Đa Nhim (1961), Đà Lạt nuclear research centre (1963), Biên Hòa industrial zone (1963)... During 1956–1960, Diệm built a relatively stable RVN with a stable economy along with the development in infrastructure and people's standards of living due to export of home comforts. Nevertheless, Diệm also admitted the dependence of RVN's economy on the US assistance: [...] "Today, <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> self-sufficient.

They returned with archbishop Ebo of Rheims, who had gone to preach {{in the land of the}} Danes on the counsel of the emperor and with the approval of the Roman pontiff and had baptized many converts to the faith during the previous summer."
