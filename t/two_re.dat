500|$|The only Italian ironclads to be {{built in}} the United States, the <b>two</b> <b>Re</b> d'Italia-class ships formed the core of the Italian armored fleet {{at the start of the}} Third Italian War of Independence fought against the Austrian Empire in mid-1866. Re d'Italia and Re di Portogallo served as the {{flagship}}s of the Second and Third Divisions, with the former also acting as the fleet flagship under Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano. The war broke out in June 1866, as Italy, which had allied with Prussia, sought to take advantage of the Austro-Prussian War to seize Austrian-controlled Venice. After initially remaining in port, the Italian fleet launched an attack on the island of Lissa in mid-July; the Austrian fleet under Rear Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff sortied to mount a counterattack, which resulted in the Battle of Lissa on 20 July. Shortly before the two fleets clashed, Persano transferred to the new turret ship [...] without informing the fleet, leaving the Italian vessels without effective leadership. In the ensuing melee, Re d'Itala was rammed and sunk by the Austrian flagship, the ironclad , with heavy loss of life. Re di Portogallo was also rammed, by the wooden ship of the line , but was only lightly damaged.|$|E

40|$|The resolvase-catalysed {{reaction}} between <b>two</b> <b>res</b> {{sites in}} a circular DNA substrate normally gives two circular recombination products linked in a two-noded catenane. Homology between the <b>two</b> <b>res</b> sites at the central overlap dinucleotide of subsite I is important for recombination. Reactions between res sites differing at one position in the central dinucleotide (AC × AT) gave a low yield of recombinants containing mismatched base-pairs, but gave large amounts of a non-recombinant four-noded knot. This result was predicted by a 'simple rotation' model for strand exchange. The mismatch is evidently recognized only after commitment to an initial 180 ° rotation of the resolvase-linked DNA ends, and it induces a second 180 ° rotation which restores correct base-pairing at the overlap, giving the four-noded product. Correct base-pairing is not essential for religation, but may be important for release of the products. Characteristic patterns of 4, 6, 8 and 10 node knots, or 4, 8, 12 and 16 node knots were obtained, depending on the reaction conditions and the resolvase. Two pathways for multiple rounds of rotation in 360 ° steps are inferred. The results support a model for strand exchange by supercoildirected subunit rotation within a resolvase tetramer...|$|R

40|$|We have {{isolated}} in quantitative yield the synaptic intermediate formed during site-specific recombination by Tn 3 resolvase and characterized it by restriction endonuclease mapping, electron microscopy and topological methods. The intermediate accumulates at low reaction temperatures and is stabilized by crosslinking of the resolvase protomers with glutaraldehyde. The DNA-resolvase complex that maintains {{the structure of}} the intermediate (the synaptosome) is approximately 100 A in diameter, forms specifically at resolution (res) sites, and requires <b>two</b> <b>res</b> sites in a supercoiled DNA molecule. Resolvase bound to individual res sites protects approximately - 0. 5 supercoil per site from relaxation by a topoisomerase, whereas the formation of the synaptosome protects - 3 supercoils and condenses the associated DNA to a supercoil density 2. 5 times that of the non-complexed substrate. Although recombination requires <b>two</b> directly repeated <b>res</b> sites, both direct and inverted sites form synaptosomes. We conclude that the specificity of recombination is achieved by a three-stage recognition system: binding of resolvase to separate sites, formation of the synaptosome and determination of site orientation from within the complex...|$|R
