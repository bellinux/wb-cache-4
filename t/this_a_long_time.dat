2500|$|In addition, {{there were}} {{divisions}} within the Japanese government between one faction that {{wanted to use the}} crisis to start a war with Britain and another that argued that since the war with China was already compounded the border war with the Soviet Union, starting a third war at this time was unwise. Even more astonishing to the Japanese Army who expected an easy triumph, the Red Army defeated them at the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, which came as a great shock and caused many Japanese generals to lose their bellicosity, if only for a moment. The Japanese Foreign Minister Hachirō Arita regularly met with Cragie and by 22 July 1939 felt that he was winning in his talks. On 26 July 1939, the United States gave the six-month notification that it would not renew the 1911 Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which increased the amount of economic pressure the British could bring against Japan. The Roosevelt administration had carried its version of appeasement in the Far East, but actions such as the Tientsin incident had persuaded the Americans that Japan was out of control, and the United States needed to start applying economic pressure via such moves like cancelling the 1911 treaty to pressure the Japanese to stop challenging the existing international order in Asia. The Showa Emperor was furious, telling his aide-de-camp Hata Shunroku: [...] "It could be a great blow to scrap metal and oil. Even if we can purchase [...] for the next six months, we will immediately have difficulties thereafter. Unless we reduce the size of our army and navy by one-third, we won't make it...They [...] should have prepared for something like <b>this</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> ago. It's unacceptable for them to be making a commotion about it now." [...] The American historian Herbert Bix wrote it was typical of the Emperor to criticize his generals and admirals for not anticipating the American move and preparing for it, instead of considering ending the war with China that had brought about the cancellation of the 1911 treaty.|$|E

"'We tried <b>this</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> {{but not a}} bite {{could we}} get; and then Fanny went {{wandering}} up the stream {{to see if she}} could find a spring, because she said she had heard that trout were often found in cold streams. After a while she came running back, and said she had found the spring, and what on earth did I think it was? She had soon come to what seemed to be {{the upper end of the}} rill, and went down on her hands and knees and looked under the edge of a great flat rock, and there she saw the end of an iron pipe through which the water was running. When I heard this I threw down my fishing-rod and would have nothing to do with an artificial rill. I remembered then that I had thought, two or three times, it had improved very much since I had first seen it; and when I asked Mr. Baxter about it last night, he said the original rill had not water enough in it for the little cataracts and ponds, and all that, and so he had brought down water from some other stream about half a mile away.|$|E

6000|$|This, then, is {{our second}} {{requirement}} for the ideal of progress. First, it must be fixed; second, it must be composite. It must not (if it is to satisfy our souls) be the mere victory of some one thing swallowing up everything else, love or pride or peace or adventure; {{it must be a}} definite picture composed of these elements in their best proportion and relation. I am not concerned at this moment to deny that some such good culmination may be, by the constitution of things, reserved for the human race. I only point out that if this composite happiness is fixed for us it must be fixed by some mind; for only a mind can place the exact proportions of a composite happiness. If the beatification of the world is a mere work of nature, then it must be as simple as the freezing of the world, or the burning up of the world. But if the beatification of the world is not a work of nature but a work of art, then it involves an artist. And here again my contemplation was cloven by the ancient voice which said, [...] "I could have told you all <b>this</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> ago. If there is any certain progress it can only be my kind of progress, the progress towards a complete city of virtues and dominations where righteousness and peace contrive to kiss each other. An impersonal force might be leading you to a wilderness of perfect flatness or a peak of perfect height. But only a personal God can possibly be leading you (if, indeed, you are being led) to a city with just streets and architectural proportions, a city in which each of you can contribute exactly the right amount of your own colour to the many coloured coat of Joseph." ...|$|E

40|$|The media {{industry}} {{in general and}} the newspaper in particular is going through major changes – technological, logistical, economical – due to the dropping sales and width of the printed daily newspaper.

Some have been preparing for <b>this</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> others have never entered the digital world of news. In qualitative interviews with informants from six swedish newspapers, coming daily, we study their strategies for a digital future – where the attention of the audience is hard to get, advertising incomes are sparse, many of the competitors offer their products for free and development of new technology, new competition and changing consumer patterns is accelerating exponentially.   The results show that those not yet successful on the internet will implement paywalls of the metered model within the next six months, {{to make up for lost}} income, one already uses a hard paywall and have lost most of its traffic, and one will not use a paywall – though they have a premium service – fearing all readers will stop visiting their site.
