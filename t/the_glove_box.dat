These {{items included}} various restraining devices including lengths of nylon cord, {{an assortment of}} knives, a tire iron, and household implements such as pliers and coat hangers. Furthermore, both the interior of Bonin's van and sections of his home were extensively bloodstained, and the inner handles from the passenger-side and rear doors of his vehicle had been removed in an obvious effort to prevent a victim escaping the vehicle.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide {{radiological}} engineering services for the design of special contamination containments. These containments were to be used during the replacement of leaking and damaged gaskets on <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> in Technical Area- 55 (TA- 55). The damaged gaskets involved 18 windows and 5 interconnecting spool pieces in fuel processing <b>glove</b> <b>boxes.</b> <b>The</b> work scope included the design and manufacture of special contamination containment enclosures (containments), the preparation of procedures and tool lists to support gasket replacement while using the containments, and the training of appropriate TA- 55 personnel in the proper installation, operation and removal of the containments. It was originally anticipated that two basic containment designs would be required, one for the windows and one for spool pieces. Upon examination of <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> it was evident that the individual space envelopes and interferences associated with each <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> would require uniquely designed containments for effective gasket replacement. This resulted in 13 individual containment designs that accommodated the interferences and allowed gasket replacement within the containment. Successful use of <b>the</b> containments for <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> gasket replacement was a significant accomplishment. The operation has proven that a properly managed containment program can enhance routine maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> while preventing a contamination release. The ability to perform these operations in containments reduces costs by preventing a contaminant release and eliminating the associated cleanup expenses, reduced radioactive waste and fuel processing down time...|$|R

25|$|The 1978 {{model year}} VAM Pacers gained new hood and grille designs, which in Mexico {{were just a}} {{facelift}} {{due to the lack}} of a V8 engine. The only technical difference of the year was the replacement of the Holley 2300 carburetor in favor of a Motorcraft 2150 unit with a built-in altitude compensator despite having a slightly lower flow. This took away a small amount of power but allowed easier passing of emission certification and was more reliable in changing altitudes. New standard features included a hood light, a speedometer in both kilometers and miles per hour, door panels including a vertical stripe pattern over their top edges, a different AM/FM radio model, a new flat-faced luxury steering wheel design with an AMC logo, and new seat designs. The heater was improved in the form of air vents appearing to the left of the instrument cluster, the center of the dashboard above the ashtray and over the top right corner of the glovebox door regardless of the presence of the air conditioning system. The heater controls were revised, obtaining the VENT option in airflow selection, which was now a sliding lever instead of the five buttons used in the prior two years. The two remaining air vents, the passenger's side one over the top left corner of <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> door and driver's side one integrated to the cover under the steering column, could only be obtained with the A/C system.|$|E

In this period, 40 metric tons of plutonium (HM) has been processed into 90 reloads of MOX fuel for commercial light water reactors. The decision to stop the production in 2006 and to decommission the MOX plant {{was the result of}} the shrinkage of the MOX fuel market owing to political and customer’s factors. As a significant part of the decommissioning project of the Dessel MOX plant, about 170 medium-sized <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> and about 1. 300 metric tons of structure and equipment outside <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> are planned for decommissioning.

5|$|On {{the evening}} of September 11, 1957, {{plutonium}} shavings in a <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> located in building 771 (the Plutonium Recovery and Fabrication Facility) spontaneously ignited. The fire spread to <b>the</b> flammable <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> materials, including plexiglas windows and rubber <b>gloves.</b> <b>The</b> fire rapidly spread through <b>the</b> interconnected <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> and ignited <b>the</b> large bank of High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters located in a plenum downstream. Within minutes the first filters had burned out, allowing plutonium particles {{to escape from the}} building exhaust stacks. The building exhaust fans stopped operating due to fire damage at 10:40 PM, which ended the majority of the plutonium release. Fire fighters initially used carbon dioxide fire extinguishers because water can act as a moderator and cause plutonium to go critical.

40|$|<b>Glove</b> <b>boxes</b> are {{extensively}} used in {{a nuclear}} industry to handle hazardous materials. They are generally interconnected with each other through a flexible link and stand freely on the floor. To check the seismic stability of <b>the</b> interconnected <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> and evaluate safety margins in design, extensive full scale shake table testing of two interconnected <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> had been carried out. Objective was to observe effects of rigid body and elastic motions, arising due to base excitation, on stability and integrity of the system. It was observed that sliding was predominant mode of motion with associated low amplitude rocking motion. Elastic deformations were very limited to affect {{the integrity of the}} system. It was observed that to increase seismic stability of <b>the</b> interconnected <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> system, relative sliding displacement between the two should be controlled. Further to shake table testing, nonlinear time history finite element analysis was also carried out. Analysis results were found to be coherent with the corresponding test results. In addition to that, to determine a safe upper bound on sliding displacement, a numerical method is proposed. This paper discuss the test results to enhance understanding of seismic behavior of two interconnected <b>glove</b> <b>boxes.</b> Important interpretations are accentuated to give a clear understanding to the designers.
