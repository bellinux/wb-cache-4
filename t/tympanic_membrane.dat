5|$|The {{outer ear}} is the {{external}} {{portion of the}} ear and includes the fleshy visible pinna (also called the auricle), the ear canal, and the outer layer of the eardrum (also called the <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane).</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{round window}} {{allows for the}} fluid within the inner ear to move. As the stapes pushes the {{secondary}} <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane,</b> fluid in the inner ear moves and pushes the membrane of the round window out by a corresponding amount into the middle ear. The ossicles help amplify sound waves by nearly 15–20 times.|$|E
5|$|Primary Secretory Otitis Media (PSOM), {{also known}} as glue ear, {{consists}} of a highly viscous mucus plug which fills the dog's middle ear and may cause the <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> to bulge. PSOM has been reported almost exclusively in Cavaliers, and it may affect over half of them. Because the pain and other sensations {{in the head and}} neck areas, resulting from PSOM, are similar to some symptoms caused by syringomyelia (SM), some examining veterinarians have mis-diagnosed SM in Cavaliers which actually have PSOM and not SM.|$|E

40|$|A 3 -year-old girl {{is brought}} to your office by her mother because she has a fever and {{complains}} that her ear hurts. She has no significant medical history. The child is not pleased {{to be in the}} physician 2 ̆ 7 s office and has been crying. Her mother explains that she developed a cold about 3 days ago with sniffles. Her temperature is 37. 8 degreesC (100 degreesF), {{and the rest of the}} physical examination is completed with some difficulty. The only abnormalities are slight redness of the throat. a nose full of thick green mucus, and injected <b>tympanic</b> <b>membranes.</b> You wonder what findings other than red <b>tympanic</b> <b>membranes</b> should lead you to diagnose otitis media and also consider the recent controversy about whether to treat acute otitis media (AOM) with antibiotics...|$|R
25|$|This {{hearing loss}} is mainly due to fluid {{in the middle}} ear or rupture of the <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane.</b> Prolonged {{duration}} of otitis media is associated with ossicular complications and, together with persistent <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> perforation, contributes to {{the severity of the}} disease and hearing loss. When a cholesteatoma or granulation tissue is present in the middle ear, the degree of hearing loss and ossicular destruction is even greater.|$|E
25|$|Use {{of certain}} {{medications}} with a ruptured <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> can cause tinnitus, vertigo, dizziness and hearing loss in some cases.|$|E
25|$|In severe or {{untreated}} cases, the <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> may perforate, {{allowing the}} pus in the middle-ear space to drain into the ear canal. If there is enough, this drainage may be obvious. Even though the perforation of the <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> suggests a highly painful and traumatic process, {{it is almost}} always associated with a dramatic relief of pressure and pain. In a simple case of acute otitis media in an otherwise healthy person, the body's defenses are likely to resolve the infection and the ear drum nearly always heals.|$|E
50|$|In many classifications, the Crambidae {{have been}} treated as a {{subfamily}} of the Pyralidae or snout-moths. The principal difference is a structure in the ears called the praecinctorium, which joins two <b>tympanic</b> <b>membranes</b> in the Crambidae, and is absent from the Pyralidae. The latest review by Munroe and Solis, in Kristensen (1999), retains the Crambidae as a full family.|$|R
50|$|The Arabian toad has {{a rounded}} head and snout, {{prominent}} eyes and small <b>tympanic</b> <b>membranes.</b> Its back {{is covered with}} small warts and it varies in colour, being grey, tan, brown or green, often with golden speckles. The male is generally smaller than the female. The long croak of the male sounds like a rusty door hinge.|$|R
50|$|The jaws {{of early}} synapsids, {{including}} {{the ancestors of}} mammals, {{were similar to those}} of other tetrapods of the time, with a lower jaw consisting of a tooth-bearing dentary bone and several smaller posterior bones. The jaw joint consisted of the articular bone in the lower jaw and the quadrate in the upper jaw. The early pelycosaurs (late Carboniferous and early Permian) most probably did not have <b>tympanic</b> <b>membranes</b> (external eardrums), and their massive stapes bones supported the braincase, with the lower ends resting on the quadrates. But their descendants the therapsids (including mammals' ancestors) probably did have <b>tympanic</b> <b>membranes</b> and these probably were in contact with the quadrate bones; and the stapes bones were still in contact with the quadrates but functioned as auditory ossicles rather than braincase supports; so the therapsids' quadrates had a dual function, as part of the jaw joint and as parts of the hearing system.|$|R
25|$|The tensor tympani acts {{to dampen}} the noise {{produced}} by chewing. When tensed, the muscle pulls the malleus medially, tensing the <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> and damping vibration {{in the ear}} ossicles and thereby reducing the perceived amplitude of sounds.|$|E
25|$|An {{option for}} severe {{acute otitis media}} in which analgesics are not {{controlling}} ear pain is to perform a tympanocentesis, i.e., needle aspiration through the <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> to relieve the ear pain and to identify the causative organism(s).|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} ear, {{the energy of}} {{pressure}} waves is translated into mechanical vibrations by the three auditory ossicles. Pressure waves move the <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> which in turns moves the malleus, the first bone of the middle ear. The malleus articulates to incus which connects to the stapes. The footplate of the stapes connects to the oval window, {{the beginning of the}} inner ear. When the stapes presses on the oval window, it causes the perilymph, the liquid of the inner ear to move. The middle ear thus serves to convert the energy from sound pressure waves to a force upon the perilymph of the inner ear. The oval window has only approximately 1/18 the area of the <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> and thus produces a higher pressure. The cochlea propagates these mechanical signals as waves in the fluid and membranes, and then converts them to nerve impulses which are transmitted to the brain.|$|E
40|$|There is no {{preferred}} {{method for}} establishing the infectious etiology of {{acute otitis media}} (AOM). Bacterial or viral pathogens are found in most cases.

40|$|Natural passive {{mechanical}} {{systems such as}} ear <b>tympanic</b> <b>membranes</b> may show active responses by incorporating feedback mechanisms which then affect their mechanical structure.

Experimental results, given by a proposed-built real-time embedded system, show time and amplitude dependency towards dynamic frequency adaptation according to the intensity of acoustic input signals...|$|R
25|$|The {{cause of}} AOM {{is related to}} {{childhood}} anatomy and immune function. Either bacteria or viruses may be involved. Risk factors include exposure to smoke, use of pacifiers, and attending daycare. It occurs more commonly among Indigenous peoples {{and those who have}} Down syndrome. OME frequently occurs following AOM and may be related to viral upper respiratory infections, irritants such as smoke, or allergies. Looking at the eardrum is important for making the correct diagnosis. Signs of AOM include bulging or a lack of movement of the <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> from a puff of air. About 4.4% of the population develop CSOM.|$|E
25|$|The avian ear {{is adapted}} {{to pick up on}} slight and rapid changes of pitch found in bird song. General avian <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> form is ovular and {{slightly}} conical. Morphological differences in the middle ear are observed between species. Ossicles within green finches, blackbirds, song thrushes, and house sparrows are proportionately shorter to those found in pheasants, Mallard ducks, and sea birds. In song birds, a syrinx allows the respective possessors to create intricate melodies and tones. The middle avian ear is made up of three semicircular canals, each ending in an ampulla and joining to connect with the macula sacculus and lagena, of which the cochlea, a straight short tube to the external ear, branches from.|$|E
25|$|The stapes (stirrup) ossicle bone of {{the middle}} ear transmits {{vibrations}} to the fenestra ovalis (oval window) {{on the outside of the}} cochlea, which vibrates the perilymph in the vestibular duct (upper chamber of the cochlea). The ossicles are essential for efficient coupling of sound waves into the cochlea, since the cochlea environment is a fluid–membrane system, and it takes more pressure to move sound through fluid–membrane waves than it does through air; a pressure increase is achieved by the area ratio of the <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> to the oval window, resulting in a pressure gain of about 20 from the original sound wave pressure in air. This gain is a form of impedance matching – to match the soundwave travelling through air to that travelling in the fluid–membrane system.|$|E
50|$|Moths {{are known}} to engage in {{acoustic}} forms of communication, most often as courtship, attracting mates using sound or vibration. Like most other insects, moths pick up these sounds using <b>tympanic</b> <b>membranes</b> in their abdomens. An example {{is that of the}} polka-dot wasp moth (Syntomeida epilais), which produces sounds with a frequency above that normally detectable by humans (about 20 kHz). These sounds also function as tactile communication, or communication through touch, as they stridulate, or vibrate a substrate like leaves and stems.|$|R

Methods: In this observational prospective study, 237 patients were recruited from the intensive care unit of Imam Ali Hospital of Kermanshah. The patients’ body temperatures were measured by four peripheral methods; oral, axillary, tympanic, and forehead along with a standard central nasopharyngeal measurement. After data collection, the results were analyzed by paired t-test, kappa coefficient, receiver operating characteristic curve, and using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 19, software. Results: There was a significant meaningful correlation between all the peripheral methods when compared with the central measurement (P< 0. 001). Kappa coefficients showed good agreement between the temperatures of right and left <b>tympanic</b> <b>membranes</b> and the standard central nasopharyngeal measurement (88 %). Paired t-test demonstrated an acceptable precision with forehead (P= 0. 132), left (P= 0. 18) and right (P= 0. 318) <b>tympanic</b> <b>membranes,</b> oral (P= 1. 00), and axillary (P= 1. 00) methods. Sensitivity and specificity of both the left and right <b>tympanic</b> <b>membranes</b> were more than for other methods. Conclusion: The tympanic and forehead methods had the highest and lowest accuracy for measuring body temperature, respectively. It is recommended to use the tympanic method (right and left) for assessing a patient’s body temperature in the intensive care units because of high accuracy and acceptable precision.

40|$|The dictum that {{patients}} who have plastic ventilation tubes (grommets) inserted in their <b>tympanic</b> <b>membranes</b> should not go swimming is questioned. A theoretical assessment is made of the pressure necessary to push water through a grommet. This value is compared with practical observations.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{studies have}} shown that the {{formation}} of myringosclerosis could be reduced by the application of antioxidant enzymes and elements. ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of coenzyme Q 10 on the prevention of experimentally induced myringosclerosis. MethodForty-eight healthy female wistar albino rats were bilaterally myringotomized and divided into four groups randomly. Group A received no treatment, group B was administered oral coenzyme Q 10. Group C was treated with topical saline solution, group D received topically coenzyme Q 10. On the 15 th day of treatment, <b>tympanic</b> <b>membranes</b> were examined by otomicroscopy. Myringosclerotic lesions were documented semiquantitatively by using 4 -point scale. After harvesting <b>tympanic</b> <b>membranes</b> were evaluated histopathologically. ResultsIn group D (topical coenzyme Q 10), we observed otitis within the first four days of the study and this group was excluded from the study. Regarding otomicroscopic examinations, there were no significant differences among groups in myringosclerosis formation (p = 0. 241). When group A (non treatment) compared to groups B and C regarding histopathologic examination, the results demonstrated statistical significant differences (p = 0. 004; p < 0. 001), respectively. There was no statisticaly significant difference between groups B and C (p = 0. 160).

2500|$|Motorcycle {{and other}} power-sport riders benefit by wearing foam earplugs when legal {{to do so}} to avoid {{excessive}} road, engine, and wind noise, but their ability to hear music and intercom speech is actually enhanced when doing so. The ear can normally detect 1-billionth of an atmosphere of sound pressure level,Pa (...) Standard atmospheric pressure is 101,325Pa. 2 x 10−5 / 100,000 = 0.2 x 10−9, a ratio of less than a billionth. hence it is incredibly sensitive. At very high sound pressure levels, muscles in the ear tighten the <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> and {{this leads to a}} small change in the geometry of the ossicles and stirrup that results in lower transfer of force to the oval window of the inner ear (the acoustic reflex).|$|E
2500|$|The tympanic reflex {{helps prevent}} {{damage to the}} inner ear by {{muffling}} the transmission of vibrations from the <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> to the oval window. [...] The reflex has a response time of 40 milliseconds, not fast enough to protect the ear from sudden loud noises such as an explosion or gunshot. [...] Thus, the reflex most likely developed to protect early humans from loud thunder claps which do not happen in a split second. [...] The reflex works by contracting {{the muscles of the}} inner ear, the tensor tympani and the stapedius. [...] This pulls the manubrium of the malleus inwards and tightens it. This tightening prevents the vibrations from disturbing the perilymph. Withdrawal from drugs such as benzodiazepines had been known to cause tonic tensor tympani syndrome (TTTS) during withdrawal. The tympanic reflex will also activate when loud vibrations are generated by the person themselves. The tensor tympani can often be observed vibrating while shouting at an increased volume, dampening the sound somewhat.|$|E
2500|$|For solids and liquids like bone, {{muscle and}} blood, this added {{pressure}} {{is not much}} of a problem; but it is a problem for any air-filled spaces like the mouth, ears, paranasal sinuses and lungs. This is because the air in those spaces reduces in volume when under pressure and so does not provide those spaces with support against the higher outside pressure. Even at a depth of [...] underwater, an inability to equalize air pressure in the middle ear with outside water pressure can cause pain, and the <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> (eardrum) can rupture at depths under 10ft (3 m). The danger of pressure damage is greatest in shallow water because the ratio of pressure change is greatest near the surface of the water. For example, the pressure increase between the surface and 10m (33ft) is 100% (100 kPa to 200 kPa), but the pressure increase from 30m (100ft) to 40m (130ft) is only 25% (400 kPa to 500 kPa).|$|E
