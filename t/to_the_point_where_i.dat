You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E

500|$|Soon after {{completing}} [...] "Make It Happen", Carey eagerly presented the final {{song on the}} set list, [...] "I'll Be There".

Several days after the concert, Carey sat down with Melinda Newman from Billboard, telling her of the experience recording the show, as well as her view on it from a creative perspective.

From late July to early September, the band participated in the 2007 Projekt Revolution tour with Linkin Park. On August 3 {{it was announced that}} O'Connell had injured his back, and he was replaced by Matchbook Romance drummer Aaron Stern {{for the remainder of the}} tour. Shortly after the tour Mascherino left the band, although his departure was not announced until early October. He said, [...] "It was getting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> felt I had taken the road as long as I possibly could," [...] and his compositions were [...] "more pop than anyone else [...] wanted to go." [...] Mascherino had written over 45 songs, most intended for Louder Now but turned down by the band. He began a solo project, the Color Fred.|$|E

In October, the group revealed that their next album was [...] "in its very early stages". In December, Rubano said the group was in New York City working on new material, having already written six songs. Prior to demoing, O'Connell had to have back surgery, having injured it during the Projekt Revolution tour. During the demoing process, the group tried different drummers, but according to Rubano: [...] "They just weren't Mark. Not enough ferocity, intensity." [...] Following this, the band's members took time to refocus themselves after several years of constant touring. Lazzara sorted his life out following addiction issues, ending his engagement to Chauntelle DuPree of Eisley. He subsequently moved to another town, got married, and had a child. O'Connell also got married, Reyes spent time with his family, and Rubano recorded music for the TV show Electric Company.|$|E

[...] Although a Hobart nomination had been talked about at least since Griggs' victory the previous November, Hobart expressed reluctance {{in a letter to}} his wife from the convention: [...] "It looks to me I will be nominated for Vice-President whether I want it or not, and as I get nearer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> may, I am dismayed at the thought...

[...] Despite Hobart's expressed hesitation, he was welcomed home by a crowd of 15,000 at the Paterson Armory. [...] City officials, feeling they had insufficient fireworks to properly honor Hobart, obtained more from New York City.|$|E
500|$|... "Fire Water Burn" [...] {{played a}} major role in the slow build of {{interest}} that ultimately led to the band's mainstream breakthrough. Because the band could not afford financially solvent national tours, they promoted themselves by sending their music to alternative rock-based radio stations across the country. Eventually, an intern brought the band to the attention of the music director of 107.7 The End in Seattle. The director, liking what he heard, played [...] "Fire Water Burn" [...] on his Friday night show. After airing, the station was flooded with phone calls asking about the song and the band and the director passed the song onto the music director at KROQ-FM in Los Angeles. This snowball effect eventually overwhelmed the band with demands for their new record. After hearing of the underground success One Fierce Beer Coaster was receiving, many record labels began courting the band. According to manager Brett Alperowitz in an interview with HitQuarters, Madonna's label Maverick [...] "really wanted to sign the band in the worst possible way, even <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> had to tell Madonna that I couldn’t put her on the phone with Jimmy Pop."

He recorded 30wins {{and the lowest}} GAA average of his career to that point, 3.41. The Bears finished the regular season as league leaders, and won the John D. Chick Trophy as the South Division Champions. Hextall lived up to his aggressive reputation in the Conference final, played against the St. Catharines Saints, fighting three different members of the opposition side during a single bench-clearing brawl. The Bears advanced to the Calder Cup final, having beaten the New Haven Nighthawks 4–1 and the St.Catharines Saints 4–3. In the final, they faced the Adirondack Red Wings, who won the championship by four games to two. Hextall played 13games in the playoffs, of which his team won five, and his GAA was3.23. He was named as the Dudley [...] "Red" [...] Garrett Memorial Award winner, as the AHL's outstanding rookie player.

[...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix also praised the Glee-spoofing, saying [...] "'Regional Holiday Music' was the logical, clever, funny endpoint to it." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said, [...] "As with its best theme-episodes, the show bridged the gap between high-concept parody and character-based comedy." [...] TV Fanatic's Leigh Raines gave the episode a 4/5 rating, saying while the show [...] "definitely went out with a bang, it didn't totally blow my socks off... While there were a few moments that upped the ick factor, overall this episode fell on the positive side." [...] She praised Troy and Abed's rap performance, but called the scene where Annie seduces Jeff [...] "creepy". Robert Canning of IGN said it was a [...] "great" [...] episode, but [...] "faltered just a bit" [...] at the end: [...] "Abed's realization that his attempts to brighten the holiday only made things darker, as Jeff had previously suggested, fit the character well enough, but the study group's follow-up felt a bit forced and holiday hokey.
