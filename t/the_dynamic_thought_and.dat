5000|$|Early {{philosophers}} {{believed the}} body to have a rational, inner nature that helped guide our <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> bodies. This intuitive force, our soul, was viewed as having supreme control over our entire being. However, this view changed during the intellectual revolution of the 17th century. [...] The mind versus the body was a forever evolving concept that received great attention {{from the likes of}} Descartes, Locke and Kant. From once believing that the mind and body interact, to thinking the mind is completely separate from the body, rationalist and empirical views were deeply rooted in the understanding of this phenomenon. Field Theory emerged when Lewin considered a person's behavior to consist of many different interactions. He believed people to have <b>dynamic</b> <b>thoughts,</b> forces, <b>and</b> emotions that shifted their behavior to reflect their present state.|$|R

30|$|Our {{focus on}} freedom of {{movement}} stems from the potential ability of this dimension to conceptually distinguish between streams of thought that are more constrained (such as ruminative or goal-directed <b>thoughts)</b> <b>and</b> spontaneously unfolding streams of thought—an experience that is often intuitively considered to occur when the mind wanders. Within <b>the</b> <b>Dynamic</b> Framework of <b>Thought</b> (Christoff et al., 2016) which emphasizes how thoughts unfold over time, different sources of constraints—for example, automatic (e.g. habits, affect, salient distractors) and deliberate constraints (e.g. goal-directed focus)—dynamically influence the way thoughts unfold over time. In this model, some thought streams are more constrained (or focused on a particular topic) while other thought patterns are more “free,” i.e. {{they are less likely}} to be focused on a particular topic and will tend towards greater content variability over time (Mills, Herrera-Bennett, Faber, & Christoff, 2018). For example, night-time dreaming is considered to have low levels of constraint and thus higher degrees of freedom that are less bound to reality, compared to creative thinking which involves spontaneity but also elements of topical constraint; however, both can be considered forms of spontaneous thought (Christoff et al., 2016). Freedom of movement in thought would vary on a continuum from high to low based on the amount of net constraints that operate on <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> flow of <b>thought</b> at any moment, which can come from a variety of sources including (but not limited to) conscious or latent goal pursuits, habits, as well as perceptual or emotional demands.|$|R

5000|$|A deeper problem, {{to which}} Mandel alludes with his book Trotsky: A study in <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> of his <b>thought,</b> {{is that if}} we regard certain {{conditions}} as possible to change for the better, {{we might be able to}} change them, even if currently people believe it is impossible—whereas if we regard them as unchangeable, we are unlikely to change them at all, even although they could possibly be changed ( [...] a similar insight occurs in pragmatism). That is, we make things possible, by doing something about them rather than do nothing.

To avoid doing this, this article indicates wherever possible whose critical theory is at issue and at what phase in its development. The Frankfurt School critical theory is a particular kind of Gesellschaftskritik or social criticism, the practical aims of which are essential to and inseparable from it. Indeed, as distinct from social theory or sociology, critical theory is, in the eyes of its architects and practitioners, a kind of practice. Yet critical theory is still very much philosophy. Furthermore, critical theory from early on had an almost entirely negative view of instrumental reasoning. This raises the question which asks about the kind of practical upshot that critical theory can have, absent of all political, moral, and prudential considerations...|$|R
40|$|My {{sense of}} {{contemporary}} moral psychology – {{a field of}} research that has been my interest for all of my scholarly career – {{is that it has}} provided rich understandings regarding the development of moral reasoning, but has been relatively impoverished in terms of its appreciation of moral personality and character.

The basic goal of my recent research is to formulate a more balanced account of moral functioning that meaningfully integrates moral cognition with moral character and action – a research direction that I will illustrate today through the study of moral exemplarity.

However, it is not known whether swarming queens produce a chemical bouquet that is distinct from non-swarming queens, containing either unique chemicals or altered proportions of chemicals. We found that queens emitted higher quantities and greater numbers of unique volatiles at liftoff than they did prior to swarming or in clustered bivouacs, and swarming workers tended to be attracted to these liftoff volatile blends. Pentadecane and heptadecane were collected most frequently and emitted in significantly higher quantities by queens at liftoff; these compounds have been described as pheromone components in other social insects, but not yet in honey bees.

40|$|In {{saying that}} meaning is a physiognomy, Wittgenstein invokes a {{philosophical}} tradition of critical physiognomy, one that developed {{in opposition to}} a scientific physiognomy. The form of a critical physiognomic judgment is one of reasoning that is circular <b>and</b> <b>dynamic,</b> grasping intention, <b>thoughts,</b> <b>and</b> emotions in seeing the expressive movements of bodies in action. In identifying our capacities for meaning with our capacities for physiognomic perception, Wittgenstein develops an understanding of perception and meaning as oriented and structured by our shared practical concerns and needs. For Wittgenstein, critical physiognomy is both fundamental for any meaningful interaction with others and a capacity we cultivate, and so expressive of taste in actions and ways of living. In recognizing how fundamental our capacity for physiognomic perception is to our form of life Wittgenstein inherits and radicalizes a tradition of critical physiognomy that stretches back to Kant and Lessing. Aesthetic experiences such as painting, poetry, and movies can be vital to the cultivation of taste in actions and in ways of living...|$|R

40|$|A pool of low-ozone air {{resides in}} the Arctic {{stratosphere}} in summer. Its formation and maintenance arise {{from a combination of}} chemical ozone-destruction and transport processes. The summertime ozone destruction is induced by gas-phase chemistry dominated by nitrogen and hydrogen catalytic cycles, which are efficient due to long summertime insolation at high latitudes. It is shown that, during events referred to as low-ozone episodes (LOEs), column ozone can locally decrease to values comparable with the seasonal minimum. A combination is used of (i) assimilation of satellite ozone observations from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment, (ii) chemical trajectory modelling, and (iii) the gathering of new lidar and in situ ozone observations in the European Arctic in summer 2000. Hence it is shown that such LOEs involve the displacement of the pool of lowozone air in the middle stratosphere, which is more <b>dynamic</b> than previously <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> undergoes pronounced meridional excursions, in particular towards northern Europe. The thinner the ozone layer, the more ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaches the ground, where it can impact on human health and ecosystems.

40|$|The present set of {{experiments}} developed a novel behavioral paradigm {{to examine whether}} taste-like sensory signals are detected in the intestine and functionally integrated with ongoing ingestive behavior. Using a modified conditioned taste aversion procedure, these experiments show that rats detect and track with high temporal resolution {{the presence of a}} bitter cue in the intestine to temporarily suspend intake. This response to bitter is partially mediated by the gut peptide cholecystokinin acting in a paracrine fashion. The results also show that rats encode information about sweet cues in the intestine to proactively control intake in anticipation of malaise, but only under conditions in which the sweet taste is received in combination with a functional carbohydrate in training. Consistent with this, intestinal sweet taste reception alone does not contribute to the unconditioned negative feedback of two carbohydrates. These results provide evidence that post-oral preabsorptive chemoreception is more <b>dynamic</b> than previously <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> chemical qualities of foods, beyond their macronutrient content, are encoded. The intestinal taste aversion paradigm developed here provides a sensitive and effective protocol for evaluating which tastants—and concentrations of tastants—in the lumen of the gut can control ingestion. ...|$|R

Rural farm landscapes lie in the middle of the landscape spectrum between cultural and natural systems. These are some of our most <b>dynamic</b> landscapes, recording <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> expressing our cultural values on the land. (NZFS 1985). This dissertation is concerned primarily with planted shelter in our rural landscapes.

It is important to understand why shelter is important not only from a philosophical viewpoint but also from a practical and functional viewpoint. These are what ultimately provides benefits to people and the environment. Chapter three examines the evolution of shelter in our rural landscapes and proposes an evolutionary cycle which we have followed. Changing attitudes and people's perception of shelter over time is also studied. Chapter four reviews the organizations and individuals who are responsible for influencing shelter establishment in the last forty years. Chapter five studies a series of real life situations and suggests changes to improve benefits obtained from planting.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between death and artistic creativity {{has always been}} an interesting and important point of view from which to understand the development of Western (but not only Western) art in its capacity to represent the spirit of the ages and of history, the {{relationship between}} subject and object, between artist and the reality around him. Within this perspective, German Romantic thought, which is at the beginning of Western aesthetic modernity, has a particularly significant meaning: in the poetics {{of one of the most}} important exponents of this tradition, Friedrich Hölderlin, the concept of “negative” represents <b>the</b> essential <b>dynamic</b> of <b>thought,</b> i. e. tragic dialectic, the power of dissolution and of death. In the context of the artistic avant-garde of the early twentieth century, the Romantic philosophical tradition is a moment of extraordinary and often controversial symbolic meaning. The concept of abstraction is the main feature of the much-celebrated modern art revolution and in the development of the so called “post-auratic art” it is involved in a very intense dialogue with life, with its dynamics and contradictions. With regards to the theme of death and of flesh decay, the British artist Damien Hirst, one of the most celebrated in contemporary art, develops one of the most interesting and challenging phases of its production, in which the same desecration of the taboo of death becomes a powerful communicative gesture and a pure artistic transfiguration act...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: There {{is limited}} {{evaluation}} of clinical and theoretical claims that sexual <b>thoughts</b> of children <b>and</b> coercing others facilitate sexual offending. The {{nature of these}} thoughts (what they contain) also is unknown. Aim: To examine the relation between child or coercive sexual <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> sexual offending and to determine {{the nature of these}} <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> any differences among sexual offending (SO), non-sexual offending (NSO), and non-offending (NO) men. Methods: In a cross-sectional computerized survey, anonymous qualitative and quantitative self-reported sexual <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> experience data were collected from 279 adult volunteers composing equal numbers of SO, NSO, and NO men recruited from a medium-security UK prison and a community sample of 6, 081 men. Main Outcome Measures: Computerized Interview for Sexual <b>Thoughts</b> <b>and</b> Computerized Inventory of Sexual Experiences. Results: Three analytical approaches found child sexual thoughts were related to sexual offending; sexual thoughts with coercive themes were not. Latent class analyses identified three types of child sexual thought (primarily differentiated by interpersonal context: the reporting of own emotions, emotions of others, or both) and four types of sexual thoughts of coercing others (chiefly discriminated by the other person's response: no emotional states reported, consent, non-consent, or mixed). Type of child sexual <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> participant group were not significantly related. Type of coercive sexual <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> group were marginally related; the consensual type was more common for the NO group and the non-consensual type was more common for the SO group than expected statistically. Conclusion: Child sexual thoughts are a risk factor for sexual offending and should be assessed by clinicians. In general, sexual thoughts with coercive themes are not a risk factor, although thought type could be important (ie, thoughts in which the other person expresses an enduring lack of consent). Exploring <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> risk factors associated with each type of child <b>and</b> coercive <b>thought</b> could lead to more targeted treatment...|$|R
