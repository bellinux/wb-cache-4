In this study, we investigated the impact of urbanization on <b>trace</b> element <b>contamination</b> and stress physiology in a wild bird species, the common blackbird (Turdus merula), along an urbanization gradient (from rural to moderately urbanized areas). Specifically, we described the contamination levels of blackbirds by 4 non-essential (Ag, Cd, Hg, Pb) and 9 essential trace elements (As, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Se, Zn), and explored the putative disrupting effects of the non-essential element contamination on corticosterone levels (a hormonal proxy for environmental challenges). We found that non-essential trace element burden (Cd and Pb specifically) increased with increasing urbanization, indicating a significant <b>trace</b> element <b>contamination</b> even in medium sized cities and suburban areas. Interestingly, the increased feather non-essential trace element concentrations were also associated with elevated feather corticosterone levels, suggesting that urbanization probably constrains birds and that this effect may be mediated by <b>trace</b> element <b>contamination.</b> Future experimental studies are now required to disentangle the influence of multiple urban-related constraints on corticosterone levels and to specifically test the influence {{of each of these}} trace elements on corticosterone secretion...|$|R

40|$|Processing silicon {{substrates}} for PV applications involves texturing, cleaning and/or etching wafer surfaces {{with chemical}} solutions. Depending on the cleanliness {{of the industrial}} equipment and {{the purity of the}} chemical solutions, surface contamination with metals or organic residues is possible [1]. The presence of <b>trace</b> <b>contamination</b> at PV junctions leads to both mid-level traps and photonic defects, which ultimately cause reduced efficiency and rapid cell degradation. Metallic impurities have a greater impact on PV cell lifetime due to their deeper energy levels in the silicon band gap [2].

40|$|Defect-induced {{ferromagnetism}} {{has triggered}} {{a lot of}} investigations and controversies. The major issue is that the induced ferromagnetic signal is so weak that it can sufficiently {{be accounted for by}} <b>trace</b> <b>contamination.</b> To resolve this issue, we studied the variation of the magnetic properties of SiC after neutron irradiation with fluence covering four orders of magnitude. A large paramagnetic component has been induced and scales up with defect concentration, which can be well accounted for by uncoupled divacancies. However, the ferromagnetic contribution is still weak and only appears in the low fluence range of neutrons or after annealing treatments. First-principles calculations hint towards a mutually exclusive role of the concentration of defects: Defects favor spin polarization at the expense of magnetic interaction. Combining both experimental and first-principles calculation results, the defect-induced ferromagnetism can be understood as a local effect which cannot be scaled up with the volume. Therefore, our investigation answers the long-standing question why the defect-induced ferromagnetic signal is weak. Comment: 30 pages, 14 figure...|$|E

40|$|The highly {{heterogeneous}} genus Bacillus {{comprises the}} largest species group of endospore forming bacteria.

40|$|We used a {{standard}} {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) /Southern blot assay (sensitivity > 10 − 5) to detect human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type I (HTLV-I) proviral pX, pol, and env genes in the lesional skin of 42 American patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). As in some prior reports using similar methods, a variable proportion of PCR tests were positive (seven of 42 for pX, three of 42 for pol, and two of 37 for env), resulting in an overall positive test rate of 12 of 121 (10 %). To determine {{the significance of these}} positive test results, we performed several additional studies. D 1 S 80 polymorphism analysis of CTCL cases and HTLV-I PCR analysis of non-CTCL dermatosis controls showed no evidence that positive PCR tests resulted from sample mislabeling, gross HTLV-I contamination, or human endogenous retro-viruses. We then modified the standard PCR assay to incorporate ultraviolet (UV) light to destroy low-level PCR contamination. With this modified assay (sensitivity > 10 − 5, only three of 12 previously positive cases were still positive, suggesting that the earlier positives were due to <b>trace</b> <b>contamination</b> of PCR reagents or <b>trace</b> <b>contamination</b> of sample DNA. This interpretation was also supported by: (i) a match between pX and pol sequences cloned from one PCR-positive specimen and the MT 4 -positive control, (ii) our inability to confirm HTLV-I in any PCR-positive case using genomic dot blotting (sensitivity > 10 − 2), and (iii) negative PCR results when new samples from two of the remaining positive cases were analyzed. Finally, we used our modified UV/PCR/Southern blot assay to test an additional 28 cases of American CTCL for pX. All of them were negative. Although these studies of 70 cases of American CTCL do not exclude the possibility that another virus is involved in the pathogenesis of this disease, they provide strong evidence against a role for HTLV-I. Furthermore, they emphasize the need for special strategies to control for false-positive PCR tests that can result from even trace levels of contamination with viral DNA. As a consequence, assciations between disease and viruses should be viewed skeptically if they are based primarily on conventional PCR data...|$|E
