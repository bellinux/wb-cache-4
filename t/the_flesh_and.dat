5|$|Various {{chemical}} color {{tests can}} be used to help identify fruit bodies suspected to be S.amygdalinus. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) will turn the cap flesh dingy orange, while it turns the cap cuticle red, or darker. Ammonia (as ammonium hydroxide, NH4OH) produces a dingy yellow on <b>the</b> <b>flesh,</b> <b>and</b> brown on the cap. Iron sulphate (FeSO4) produces either no change to a pale grey color with both <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> <b>and</b> the cuticle. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) causes the flesh to turn orange or pink, but has no color reaction with the cuticle.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius rubidus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to L.rufulus, but it has watery to whey-like latex and develops a strong odor of maple syrup or butterscotch when dried. Another lookalike is Lactarius thiersii, {{but it has a}} smaller cap and stem and has mild-tasting flesh and latex. <b>The</b> <b>flesh</b> <b>and</b> latex of Lactarius rufus have a strongly acrid taste, and its fruit bodies are stouter and lack an umbo. Additionally, L.rufus typically grows in a caespitose manner—with the fruit bodies clustered at a common base, and has more pallid colors and a more intense odor than L.rufulus. L.vinaceorufescens has a yellowing latex.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius sanguifluus is {{classified}} in the section Dapetes of the genus Lactarius. This section, which also includes other popular edible species such as L.deliciosus, and the less popular L.deterrimus, is characterized by mushrooms with orange or red latex that often impart a greenish stain on <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> <b>and</b> gills, an often sticky cap, and association with conifers.

5|$|Tyler {{cuts from}} Charlotte's buttocks, frying {{a strip of}} her flesh on a stove. Squires tells of how he began an affair with Monica, Tyler's wife and mother of his twin children, {{destroying}} Tyler's career. Tyler hands Squires <b>the</b> <b>flesh,</b> <b>and</b> he eats, fearing Charlotte will die. Tyler reveals how he hates cryptic crosswords, and how his son entered the Cambridge Crossword Competition, attempting to beat his mother's new husband: Squires. Squires realises that Charlotte is Tyler's daughter. Charlotte and Tyler sought revenge on Squires, but Tyler changed plans so Squires would include clues in the crossword. However, Simon's autopsy—Tyler explains—revealed that Simon and Charlotte were actually Squires's children, meaning Monica and Squires's relationship began earlier than he previously thought. Charlotte is past saving, and Tyler places a bullet on Squires's desk, quoting Chekhov's gun. Squires confirms that his middle name is Hector as he weeps over Charlotte, and Tyler circles something on the crossword. Charlotte is dead, and Squires loads the gun, placing it in his mouth. Blood splatters over the crossword and a second nina: RIP NHS.|$|E

25|$|The esteem {{which the}} islanders {{nevertheless}} held for Cook {{caused them to}} retain his body.

On the other hand, scholars such as Mosché Lazar claim it was adulterous sexual love with physical possession of the lady the desired end.|$|E

The second is to cut the eye of the hook off and then push the remainder of the hook through <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> <b>and</b> the third is to place pressure on the shank towards the flesh which pulls the barb into the now oval hole then push the hook out the way it came in.|$|E

The outermost layer of the rind can be thinly grated with a zester to produce orange zest. Zest is popular in cooking because it contains oils and has a strong flavor {{similar to that of}} the orange pulp.
