40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this {{prospective}} study was to quantitate the diagnostic value of several tachycardia features and pacing maneuvers in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) in the electrophysiology laboratory. BACKGROUNDNo study has prospectively compared the value of multiple diagnostic tools in {{a large group of}} patients with PSVT. METHODSOne hundred ninety-six consecutive patients who had 200 inducible sustained PSVTs during an electrophysiology procedure <b>were</b> included. The <b>diagnostic</b> values of four baseline electrophysiologic parameters, nine tachycardia features and five <b>diagnostic</b> pacing maneuvers <b>were</b> quantified. RESULTSThe only tachycardia characteristic <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>diagnostic</b> of atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentry was a septal ventriculoatrial (VA) time of < 70 ms, and no pacing maneuver <b>was</b> <b>diagnostic</b> for AV nodal reentry. An increase in the VA interval with the development of a bundle branch block was the only tachycardia characteristic <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>diagnostic</b> for orthodromic tachycardia, but it occurred in only 7 % of all tachycardias. An atrial-atrial-ventricular response upon cessation of ventricular overdrive pacing <b>was</b> <b>diagnostic</b> of atrial tachycardia, and this maneuver could be applied to 78 % of all tachycardias. Burst ventricular pacing excluded atrial tachycardia when the tachycardia terminated without depolarization of the atrium, but the result could be obtained only in 27 % of patients. CONCLUSIONSThis prospective study quantitates the diagnostic value of multiple observations and pacing maneuvers <b>that</b> <b>are</b> commonly used during PSVT in the electrophysiology laboratory. The findings demonstrate that diagnostic techniques rarely provide a diagnosis when used individually. Therefore, careful observations and multiple pacing maneuvers are often required for an accurate diagnosis during PSVT. The results of this study provide a useful reference with which new <b>diagnostic</b> techniques can <b>be</b> compared...|$|R

50|$|Although {{there are}} no {{biological}} tests <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>diagnostic</b> of bipolar disorder, blood tests and/or imaging may be carried out to exclude medical illnesses with clinical presentations {{similar to that of}} bipolar disorder such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, metabolic disturbance, a chronic disease, or an infection such as HIV or syphilis. A review of current and recent medications and drug use is considered to rule out these causes; common medications that can cause manic symptoms include antidepressants, prednisone, Parkinson's disease medications, thyroid hormone, stimulants (including cocaine and methamphetamine), and certain antibiotics. An EEG may be used to exclude neurological disorders such as epilepsy, and a CT scan or MRI of the head may be used to exclude brain lesions. Additional testing is especially indicated when age of first onset is mid to late life. Investigations are not generally repeated for a relapse unless there is a specific medical indication.|$|E
