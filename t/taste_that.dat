5|$|Christiaan Persoon first {{described}} Boletus calopus in 1801. Modern molecular phylogenetics {{showed that it}} was only distantly related to the type species of Boletus and required placement in a new genus; Caloboletus was erected in 2014, with C.calopus designated as the type species. Although Caloboletus calopus is not typically considered edible due to an intensely bitter <b>taste</b> <b>that</b> does not disappear with cooking, there are reports of it being consumed in eastern Europe. Its red stipe distinguishes it from edible species, such as Boletus edulis.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius subdulcis has a mild {{taste with}} a {{slightly}} bitter after-taste. Though considered edible after cooking, it is not recommended, as it has a taste reminiscent of ivy. There {{are a number of}} other mushrooms that appear at the same time and in the same areas as L.subdulcis that are preferable to it, including L.mitissimus, meaning that L.subdulcis is not particularly useful as a foodstuff. The milk is one of distinguishing features, having a sweet <b>taste</b> <b>that</b> turns bitter in the mouth, with L.subdulcis being considered a sweet milk mushroom.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} karmas provide different {{abilities of}} tastes to the bodies: tikta rasa nama-karma gives a bitter <b>taste</b> (like <b>that</b> of the nimba fruit), kasaya rasa nama-karma gives an astringent <b>taste</b> (like <b>that</b> of bibhitaka), amla rasa nama-karma gives a sour <b>taste</b> (like <b>that</b> of tamarind) and madhura rasa nama-karma gives a sweet <b>taste</b> (like <b>that</b> of sugar). The salt taste {{is produced by}} a combination of the sweet taste with another. Bitter and biting tastes are considered unpleasant, the others pleasant.|$|R
5|$|In Virginia and Carolina, the Palladian {{manner is}} epitomised in {{numerous}} Tidewater plantation houses, such as Stratford Hall or Westover Plantation, or Drayton Hall near Charleston. These examples are all classic American colonial {{examples of a}} Palladian <b>taste</b> <b>that</b> was transmitted through engravings, {{for the benefit of}} masons—and patrons, too—who had no first-hand experience of European building practice. A feature of American Palladianism was the re-emergence of the great portico, which again, as in Italy, fulfilled the need of protection from the sun; the portico in various forms and size became a dominant feature of American colonial architecture. In the north European countries the portico had become a mere symbol, often closed, or merely hinted at in the design by pilasters, and sometimes in very late examples of English Palladianism adapted to become a porte-cochere; in America, the Palladian portico regained its full glory.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, {{when he was growing}} up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good <b>taste</b> <b>that</b> they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed at last to be happening.|$|E

25|$|Crème fraîche is {{produced}} by adding a starter culture to heavy cream, and allowing it to stand at appropriate temperature until thick.

This is what gives it the <b>taste</b> <b>that</b> distinguishes it from similar dairy products like sour cream.

25|$|Chile {{has benefited}} from an influx of foreign {{investment}} and winemaking talent {{that began in the}} late 20th century. Flying winemakers introduced new technology and styles that helped Chilean wineries produce more internationally recognized wine styles. One such improvement was the use of oak. Historically Chilean winemakers had aged their wines in barrels made from rauli beechwood which imparted to the wine a unique <b>taste</b> <b>that</b> many international tasters found unpleasant. Gradually the wineries began to convert to French and American oak or stainless steel tanks for aging.|$|E
25|$|MSG {{is used in}} {{the food}} {{industry}} as a flavor enhancer with an umami <b>taste</b> <b>that</b> intensifies the meaty, savory flavor of food, as naturally occurring glutamate does in foods such as stews and meat soups. It was first prepared in 1908 by Japanese biochemist Kikunae Ikeda, who was trying to isolate and duplicate the savory taste of kombu, an edible seaweed used as a base for many Japanese soups. MSG as a flavor enhancer balances, blends, and rounds the perception of other tastes.|$|E
25|$|The chapel is {{important}} in the history of architecture for it introduced the new rocaille or rococo style into Portugal. The decorative elements of rocaille inspiration – festoons, garlands, angels – combined with the classical austerity of the structural composition are the basis of an evolving <b>taste</b> <b>that</b> would decide the future trends of Portuguese gilt woodwork. The use of columns with straight channelled shafts with gilt fillets on a lapis lazuli background, the austerity of geometric lines reinforced by the employment of precious marbles and mosaics, as well as the rocaille decoration illustrate the combination of innovations introduced by this chapel into the Portuguese decorative tradition.|$|E

The increase in the standardization of life after World War II (Suburbanization, Mass marketing, the spread of television) may be linked to the appeal of [...] "alternative" [...] lifestyles for individuals in search of “identity”. Industrial production, particularly in the sphere of fashion, was not only the popularization of stylists’ <b>tastes</b> <b>that</b> move from high fashion, through pre`t-a`-porter, to the peripheries of the system.

25|$|Commercial {{fisheries}} do not target or {{utilize the}} blind shark, as its flesh {{has a strong}} ammonia-like <b>taste</b> <b>that</b> is not easily removed. It is caught incidentally by prawn trawl and other fisheries off Queensland and New South Wales, though post-discard survival may be high due to its ability to tolerate being out of water. Small numbers of blind sharks are caught by recreational fishers, who regard them as a nuisance because its small mouth and strong jaws make removing lodged hooks difficult. It is generally {{too small to be}} susceptible to shark nets used to protect beaches. The impact of collection for the aquarium trade on this shark is unknown but not thought to be severe. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the blind shark under Least Concern, as it remains abundant and the various pressures on its population do not seem to pose significant threats. Its range overlaps a number of current and proposed Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).|$|E
25|$|To the Pennimans {{were born}} four children; Hortensia, who married Judge Brayton of Swanton; Udney, who {{inherited}} the homestead in Colchester; Julietta, who married Dr. Nathan Ryno Smith, a physician of Baltimore; and Adelia, {{who became the}} wife of Dr. Moody, {{one of the early}} physicians of Burlington. Two daughters of Adelia were well known in Burlington, Mrs. Mary M. Howe, and Mrs. Ella M. Goodrich, wife of Prof. E. Goodrich. Penniman’s descendants had in their possession some interesting Allen relics, but two beautiful old Copley portraits of Penniman and her mother, Mrs. Crean Brush, passed into the possession of Mr. Pell, the owner of Ft. Ticonderoga. They were painted in New York in 1771, when Frances was eleven years of age. She is quaintly arrayed in a long bodice and long full skirt with her hair pompadoured and powdered like her mother’s. But her face is strikingly bright and expressive. She holds in one slender hand a basket of flowers, a prophetic hint of that <b>taste</b> <b>that</b> brought her so much satisfaction when she became middle-aged. A Female Academy was started in Middlebury, Vermont in 1802, and Mrs. Emma Willard began the Middlebury Female Seminary there in 1811. It was to her school, first in Middlebury and then in Troy (Emma Willard School), that Adelia Penniman was sent for her education.|$|E
