25|$|Penny Sparrow is {{one such}} {{high-profile}} case. She posted the following through her Facebook account:These monkeys that are allowed to be released on New Year’s eve and New Year’s day on to public beaches towns etc obviously have no education what so ever so to allow them loose is inviting huge dirt and troubles and discomfort to others. I’m sorry <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> among the revellers and all I saw were black on black skins what a shame. I do know some wonderful and thoughtful black people. This lot of monkeys just don’t want to even try. But think they can voice opinions about statute and get their way oh dear. From now I shall address the blacks of South Africa as monkeys as I see the cute little wild monkeys do the same, pick drop and litter.|$|E
500|$|In 1960 Leigh {{recalled}} her ambivalence {{towards her}} first experience of critical acclaim and sudden fame, commenting, [...] "that some critics saw {{fit to be}} as foolish as <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a great actress. And I thought, that was a foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't able to carry. And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices. I find it so stupid. I remember the critic very well and have never forgiven him." ...|$|E
500|$|Simpson {{described}} {{the process of}} writing the album's twelve songs as being similar to keeping a diary, and before the album's US release she said that [...] "My inspiration came from what I have gone through in the past three years. Every single day I was thinking of what I was going through and would write songs about it." [...] The lyrics primarily deal with love and heartbreak; in particular, much of the album's lyrical content was inspired by Simpson's breakup with her boyfriend at the time, Josh Henderson. She has {{described the}} album as being [...] "very honest" [...] and [...] "very true to my emotions"—"I wasn't afraid <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hurting and how I got over it." [...] Simpson worked closely with a number of experienced songwriters on the album. The album's producer, John Shanks—who won a Grammy in February 2005, in part for his work as producer on Autobiography—receives songwriting credit alongside Simpson on all but two songs. Kara DioGuardi also receives songwriting credit, together with Simpson and Shanks, on seven of the songs, including the three singles. (See the track listing.) ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{is not a}} {{day that}} goes by that I do not feel remorse for what {{happened}} that day in My Lai", he told members of the club. [...] "I feel remorse for the Vietnamese who were killed, for their families, for the American soldiers involved and their families. I am very sorry....If you are asking why I did not stand up to them when I was given the orders, I will have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a 2nd lieutenant getting orders from my commander and I followed them—foolishly, I guess.|$|E
2500|$|One {{of the two}} quotes {{appearing}} on the Stone of Hope and attributed to King, [...] "I was a drum major for justice, peace and righteousness", is a paraphrased version of King's actual words, which were: [...] "If you want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And {{all of the other}} shallow things will not matter." [...] The Washington Posts Rachel Manteuffel noticed the change and publicized it in an August 25, 2011 column, arguing that the revised quote misrepresented both King himself and the meaning of the 1968 sermon from which it was taken, in which King imagined the sort of eulogy he might receive.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Milano auditioned for nearly every film role in her age bracket, {{including}} B movies, and finally tried to shed her [...] "nice girl" [...] image by appearing nude in several erotic films targeted at adults, such as Embrace of the Vampire, Deadly Sins and [...] She said the nude appearances {{taught her to}} begin requiring a nudity clause in her contracts giving her [...] "full control" [...] over all her nude scenes. In a 1995 interview, she explained her motivation for some explicit scenes in Embrace of the Vampire: [...] "I'm not going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> manipulated into doing things that I didn't want to do. I did {{it because it was}} a woman director and I felt protected. And I learned a lot as far as knowing where the camera is and what coverage they need so that it's not all explicit." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the fourteen quotations on the Inscription Wall, {{each side of the}} Stone of Hope includes an additional statement attributed to King. The first, from the [...] "I Have a Dream" [...] speech, is [...] "Out of the Mountain of Despair, a Stone of Hope"—the quotation that serves {{as the basis for the}} monument's design. The words on the other side of the stone used to read, [...] "I Was a Drum Major for Justice, Peace, and Righteousness", which is a paraphrased version of a longer quote by King: [...] "If you want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter." [...] The memorial's use of the paraphrased version of the quote was criticized, and was removed in August 2013.|$|E

"Nobody's been {{slinging}} any {{lies about}} ye, Miss Budd," [...] he said slowly, recovering himself resignedly from this last back-handed stroke of fate; [...] "I warn't talkin' o' you, but myself.

6000|$|Mr. Grey {{repeated}} the query, and Rose answered, [...] "Nobody; I knew {{my aunt and}} the Colonel and Lady Temple were gone in to Avoncester, and Aunt Ermine got a note from the Colonel <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{to come in to}} him with Tibbie in a fly." ...|$|E
