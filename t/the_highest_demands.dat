50|$|Orbital welding {{has almost}} always {{exclusively}} {{been carried out}} by the Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG / GTAW) technique using non-consumable electrodes, with additional cold-wire feed where necessary. The easy control of heat input makes TIG-welding the ideal welding method for fully orbital welding of tubes with specialist orbital welding heads, that incorporate a clamping device, a TIG electrode on an orbital travel device and a shielding gas chamber. Many different types of metal can be welded; high-strength, high-temperature and corrosion-resistant steels, unalloyed and low-alloyed carbon steels, nickel alloys, titanium, copper, aluminum and associated alloys. Carried out in an inert atmosphere, this controlled technique produces results that are extremely clean, have low particle counts and are free from unwanted spatter. This enables <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>demands</b> to be met regarding the mechanical and optical properties of a weld seam.|$|E

50|$|The {{final stage}} of amplification, after preamplifiers, is the output stage, where <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>demands</b> are placed on the {{transistors}} or tubes. For this reason, the design choices made around the output device (for single-ended output stages, such as in single-ended triode amplifiers) or devices (for push-pull output stages), such as the Class of operation of the output devices is often taken as {{the description of the}} whole power amplifier. For example, a Class B amplifier will probably have just the high power output devices operating cut off for half of each cycle, while the other devices (such as differential amplifier, voltage amplifier and possibly even driver transistors) operate in Class A. In a transformerless output stage, the devices are essentially in series with the power supply and output load (such as a loudspeaker), possibly via some large capacitor and/or small resistances.|$|E

A total of 21 young healthy women were examined their mean age was 24 ± 4. The analysis was carried out by means of the 3 D videographic examination method. The differences between sitting-to-standing III and stsm I and II reached a statistically significant level. Increasing postural demands prolongs the total duration of the task in these three variations and changes the proportional time ratios of individual phases of the sitting-to-standing action. The results show that <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>demands</b> are made on the body in the stsm with modified proprioception from the lower limbs.

40|$|Mozambique {{is one of}} {{the poorest}} {{countries}} in the world. It also has one of the world's highest birth rates. Until recently there has been virtually no way to study Mozambique's high fertility because of the civil war. This paper uses a very recent survey of Mozambican women from 1997. The objective {{of this paper is to}} assess the impact of modernization on fertility in Mozambique, using as a background the "supply-demand theory" presented by Easterlin and Crimmins (1985). The first part of this paper describes the indicators of modernization for Mozambique by using maps, and indicates eventual correlations. The second part deals with the estimation of equations for demand for children, the supply of children and the use of contraception. The third part shows how the modernization variables visualized in the first part of the paper influence all these equations.

40|$|ABSTRACT—We {{examined}} {{the relation between}} pressureinduced performance decrements, or ‘‘choking under pressure,’ ’ in mathematical problem solving and individual differences in working memory capacity. In cognitively based academic skills such as math, pressure is thought to harm performance by reducing the working memory capacity available for skill execution. Results demonstrated that only individuals high in working memory capacity were harmed by performance pressure, and, furthermore, these skill decrements were limited to math problems with <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>demands</b> on working memory capacity. These findings suggest that performance pressure harms individuals most qualified to succeed by consuming the working memory capacity that they rely on for their superior performance. For many people, the desire to perform their best in academics is high. Consequences for suboptimal performance, especially in examinations, include poor evaluations by mentors, teachers, and peers; lost scholarships; and relinquished educational and employment opportunities. However, in comparison to research examining the cognitive processes underlying skill learning an...|$|E
