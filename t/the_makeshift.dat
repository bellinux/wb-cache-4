5|$|A {{black-and-white}} photo of Adenhart {{along with his}} name and number {{was added to the}} center field fence at Angel Stadium. A makeshift shrine, dedicated to Adenhart, was established outside the home plate gates to Angel Stadium. <b>The</b> <b>makeshift</b> shrine was maintained by Angels personnel until its removal in December 2009. The Angels do not have any plans to create a permanent memorial.|$|E
5|$|Following the Union {{defeat at}} Bull Run, panicked {{efforts were made}} to {{strengthen}} the forts built by Barnard in order to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack. Many of <b>the</b> <b>makeshift</b> trenches and blockhouses that resulted would later be renovated and expanded into permanent defenses surrounding Fort Runyon.|$|E
5|$|After the 1793 {{beheading}} of Louis XVI {{sparked a}} war between Britain and France (see the French Revolutionary Wars), Nova Scotia Governor John Wentworth rented Kavanagh's Island to house 600 French prisoners that had been captured on St. Pierre and Miquelon. The commander of the Halifax garrison, Brigadier General James Ogilvie, objected to the plan, and instead housed the prisoners at Cornwallis Barracks in Halifax. Several prisoners were able to escape from <b>the</b> <b>makeshift</b> prison, and the rest were sent to Guernsey in June 1794.|$|E

5|$|Monmouth then marched {{overnight}} to Frome {{arriving on}} 28 June. The morale of Monmouth's forces started to collapse as {{news of the}} failure of the rebellion in Scotland arrived that day, while <b>the</b> <b>makeshift</b> army was camped in Frome. Argyll's small force had been involved in minor skirmishes at Greenock and Ellangreig. He took Ardkinglass castle, but after disagreements with key supporters about when and where to fight the royalists commanded by Rosse and William Cleland, his supporters dwindled away and the Scottish rebellion failed.|$|E
5|$|When the Persians {{heard that}} the Allied fleet was approaching, they set sail from Samos towards the Ionian mainland. According to Herodotus, this was because they had decided in council {{that they could not}} beat the Allies in a naval battle. They sent the Phoenician ships away (Herodotus does not explain why), and then sailed to the shore near Mount Mycale. Xerxes had left an army there, under the command of Tigranes, to guard Ionia. The Persians beached their ships, built a {{palisade}} around them, and prepared to guard <b>the</b> <b>makeshift</b> fort.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's three-year {{exploration}} of the northern coast of Canada {{in search of the}} Northwest Passage had ended in disaster amid accusations of murder and cannibalism, with 11 of the 20members of the group killed and the survivors reduced to eating lichen, their own boots, and the remains of rotten carcasses abandoned by wolves. The party had become stranded {{on the wrong side of}} the Coppermine River after their boats had been destroyed in a storm; John Richardson had attempted to swim to safety and suffered severe hypothermia. A single member of the party had fashioned a small canoe from canvas and willow, and the survivors had been obliged to cross the river one at a time using <b>the</b> <b>makeshift</b> canoe.|$|E
50|$|Although no toy for Scoop and Holepunch {{was ever}} {{released}} {{they appear to}} be identical to the toys for Transformers movie Grindcore and <b>the</b> X-Dimension Mini-Con <b>Makeshift.</b> <b>The</b> only visiable difference is that Scoop has a purple Autobot symbol on his chest, while the movie toy has a silver one.|$|R
5000|$|Otis Ferguson, however, said, [...] "When the man Fields {{is funny}} he is terrific... but <b>the</b> story is <b>makeshift,</b> <b>the</b> other {{characters}} are stock types, the only pace discernible is {{the distance between}} drinks or {{the rhythm of the}} fleeting seconds it takes Fields to size up trouble and duck the hell out." ...|$|R

5|$|General McDowell then ordered Shelby and Clarke to take Musgrove's Mill, a British encampment on the Enoree River. They rode {{all night}} with two hundred men, {{reaching}} their location about dawn on August 18, 1780. The colonists had estimated the enemy force was of comparable size, but an advance scout brought word there were approximately 500 British soldiers in the camp who were preparing for battle. Shelby's men and horses were too tired for a retreat and they had lost the element of surprise. He ordered his men to construct a breastwork from nearby logs and brush. In half an hour <b>the</b> <b>makeshift</b> fortifications were complete, and twenty-five colonial riders charged the British camp to provoke the attack. The British pursued {{them back to the}} main colonial force. Despite being outnumbered, the colonists killed several British officers and put their army to flight.|$|E
5|$|In another project, {{the village}} of La Vang in Quảng Trị Province near the border with North Vietnam, {{was the scene of}} a female {{apparition}} in the late 19th century. Buddhists claimed that the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (also known as Kuanyin; Vietnamese: Quan Âm) performed the miracle. Diệm's brother, Ngô Đình Thục, was the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Huế and the foremost religious figure in South Vietnam's nepotistic regime. Thục declared that the apparition was the Virgin Mary, and ordered that a cathedral be built in place of <b>the</b> <b>makeshift</b> Buddhist pagoda that occupied the site. Thơ made notable financial donations to the project for political reasons.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>makeshift</b> raft {{is shown}} as barely {{seaworthy}} as it rides the deep waves, {{while the men}} are rendered as broken and in utter despair. One old man holds the corpse of his son at his knees; another tears his hair out in frustration and defeat. A number of bodies litter the foreground, waiting to be swept away by the surrounding waves. The men in the middle have just viewed a rescue ship; one points it out to another, and an African crew member, Jean Charles, stands on an empty barrel and frantically waves his handkerchief to draw the ship's attention.|$|E

50|$|On December 30, 1992, a fire razed the Quiapo six-story {{building}} to <b>the</b> ground. <b>Makeshift</b> rooms were set up, {{and the lack}} of full facilities adversely affected the school’s enrollment in the ensuing terms.|$|R

5|$|The {{producers}} faced a stiff {{challenge in}} securing a rural bungalow {{to serve as}} the landlady's mansion. Even after obtaining a building as the best possible fit in the coastal town of Bobbili, infestation of snakes and bats posed a problem for the crew. In addition, the building was not strong enough to support the filming equipment. Under these circumstances, <b>the</b> <b>makeshift</b> production designers refurbished the building with space for chicken coops and goat pens as required by the script. To make the space look inhabited, local help was sought for trampling the ground with their livestock. The local people wanted to act as extras in exchange for providing farming tools, bullock carts and other material. As a result, the crew had to ensure that these extras didn't look into the camera during filming.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{formally}} leased for prisoner housing in 1803 after fifteen French fishermen, three surgeons, and 188 seamen {{were brought to}} Halifax as prisoners during the Napoleonic Wars. Though many of these prisoners were later sent to England or Bermuda, one of the surgeons (Antoine Noel) was hired {{to care for the}} prisoners, while at least sixteen other prisoners were able to escape. Melville was purchased for £1000 in 1804 (£68,634 as of 2010) by Robert Murray, appointed by the British Admiralty as prison agent; he was replaced shortly thereafter by John MacKellar. At the time, the facility had a maximum capacity of 200 prisoners. <b>The</b> <b>makeshift</b> prison was noted for discipline problems.|$|E
5|$|While the Potomac River forts {{were being}} built, {{planning}} and surveying was ordered for an enormous new ring of forts {{to protect the}} city. Unlike the fortifications under construction, the new forts would defend the city in all directions, not just the most direct route through Arlington. In mid-July, this work was interrupted by the First Battle of Bull Run. As the Army of Northeastern Virginia marched south to Manassas, the soldiers previously assigned to construction duties marched instead to battle. In {{the days that followed}} the Union defeat at Bull Run, panicked efforts were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack. <b>The</b> <b>makeshift</b> trenches and earthworks that resulted were largely confined to Arlington and the direct approaches to Washington.|$|E
50|$|Vursatyl and Jumbo met playing {{basketball}} and ripping free-style in Portland city parks.

50|$|Thompsons Creek {{attracted}} campers {{and fishermen}} from the 1870s onwards and by <b>the</b> 1920s, <b>makeshift</b> huts were being built by regular campers. During the 1930s depression, squatters constructed more permanent buildings, rate-free, and eked out meals from {{the creek and}} the ocean.|$|R
5000|$|The {{public housing}} program {{introduced}} [...] "multi story building" [...] with fire- and flood-proof construction. The clearance {{of the fire}} debris and demolition of <b>the</b> remaining <b>makeshift</b> houses paved <b>the</b> way for construction of the Shek Kip Mei Low-cost Housing Estate (石硤尾廉租屋邨).|$|R
5|$|Aboard the Doctor's TARDIS, House {{threatens to}} kill Amy and Rory. He plays with their senses {{as they try}} to flee through the corridors, and then sends Nephew after them. Idris makes a psychic {{connection}} with Rory to give him directions to a secondary control room (identical to the 9th and 10th Doctor's TARDIS), where he and Amy are able to lower the TARDIS's shields without House's interference. This allows the Doctor to land <b>the</b> <b>makeshift</b> TARDIS in the secondary control room, which atomises Nephew. House deletes the secondary control room as he prepares to break through the rift, which the Doctor anticipates. The TARDIS's safety protocols transfer them to the main control room, where the dying Idris releases the TARDIS's matrix back to the TARDIS, destroying House. A remnant of the TARDIS's matrix, in Idris' body, sadly states that she {{will not be able to}} speak to the Doctor again but will be there for him. Idris's body then disappears as the TARDIS matrix is fully restored.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} {{that had been}} required to provide effective coverage {{in response to the}} crises caused by the initial Japanese movements a review of <b>the</b> <b>makeshift</b> organisation was undertaken. In October 1942, the NGAWW Company was officially formed as part of New Guinea Force Signals to consolidate the Army, RAAF and Coastwatcher stations. Meanwhile, efforts were made to standardise equipment across the network and to implement common procedures. The company subsequently came under command of New Guinea Force Signals and its headquarters was established at 9-mile near Port Moresby. Captain Thomas Warren was in command of the company at this time. The establishment of the company at this time included a headquarters, a Moresby area section, a sub-area section, and a spotting station. Sub-area sections were raised as required and at various times were located at Milne Bay, Dobodura, Wau, Bena Bena, Bulolo, Nadzab, Gusap, Hollandia and Aitape. By the end of 1942 the company was maintaining 61 operational stations and had a strength of 180 men. In mid-1943, Warren was transferred to Milne Force and he handed over command temporarily to Captain Gordon King.|$|E
5|$|Plaman Mapu {{was a tiny}} Malaysian village {{only half}} a mile behind {{the western part of}} the border between Sarawak and Kalimantan. There the British had {{established}} a base for 'B' Company of the Parachute Regiment. Apart from the two 3-inch mortars stationed there, the place had little strategic value beyond being a lookout point for the British to detect Indonesian raids over the border. By the low standards of <b>the</b> <b>makeshift</b> British jungle bases, it was fairly well defended, equipped with aforementioned mortars, an interconnected trench network, and a command bunker, with supporting artillery weapons within range of the base to supply cover. The defenders of the base, by contrast, were wholly unprepared for combat. The undermanned 'B' Company had recently been supplied with a platoon of inexperienced troopers who had pitiful experience in jungle warfare. Due to the intensity of recent fighting, the base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Ted Eberhardie, had only been able to spare a few of the new men for a training course in such combat at Singapore, but one of those was Sergeant Major John Williams, who would play a crucial role in the coming battle.|$|E

50|$|While McGowan {{directed}} {{a number of}} Our Gang entries in the late-1920s, his work is considered lesser than that of his uncle. He appears on-screen in the 1932 short Free Wheeling, {{in which he is}} socked by a boxing glove attached to <b>the</b> kids' <b>makeshift</b> taxi.|$|R
25|$|He died on 31 May 1929 of {{lung cancer}} after {{a long period of}} ill health {{connected}} to <b>the</b> <b>makeshift</b> operation. 20,000 people lined the route of the procession to Aberdeen station at his funeral on the 4th of June, before he was interred at Newington Cemetery in Edinburgh.|$|E
25|$|The first {{official}} parade was held January 1, 1901. The first string band, Trilby, was organized in 1898, first paraded in 1902, and last paraded in 1924. In {{the early years}} of the official parade, <b>the</b> <b>makeshift</b> costumes of most celebrants were gradually replaced by more elaborate outfits funded by associations' fund-raising efforts.|$|E
25|$|In case of war/terrorism emergency, <b>the</b> <b>makeshift</b> pontoon bridges {{are to be}} {{established}} in the city.
