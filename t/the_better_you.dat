25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the decoding stage a child will often be devoting so much mental capacity to the process of decoding that they will have no comprehension of the meaning of the words being read. This is most likely if the text being read is at or above their skill level. It is nevertheless an important stage. Such decoding practice allows the child to improve their decoding skills with the ultimate goal of becoming automatic as it is for most skilled readers with most text they encounter. Like every skill, the more you do it <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>you</b> get. Though comprehension may be poor at this stage, it is nevertheless an important step towards comprehension. As the skill of decoding improves and the more automatic it becomes the more the child has mental capacity to devote to comprehension. Therefore, understanding of what is being read increases.|$|E

2500|$|Author Phillip Evans said in 2014 that [...] "Henderson's central {{idea was}} {{what you might call}} the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass against weakness, of {{overwhelming}} the enemy. What Henderson recognized was that, in the business world, there are many phenomena which are characterized by what economists would call increasing returns—scale, experience. The more you do of something, disproportionately <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>you</b> get. And therefore he found a logic for investing in such kinds of overwhelming mass in order to achieve competitive advantage. And that was the first introduction of essentially a military concept of strategy into the business world. ... It was on those two ideas, Henderson's idea of increasing returns to scale and experience, and Porter's idea of the value chain, encompassing heterogenous elements, that the whole edifice of business strategy was subsequently erected." ...|$|E

2500|$|I am {{told that}} the more you rehearse, <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>you</b> play. This is wrong. We often try to reduce the {{unforeseen}} to a controllable level, to prevent a sudden impulse that escapes our ability to control, yet also responds to an obscure desire. Let's allow improvisation to have its place and play its role. I think that the true interpreter {{is the one who}} improvises. We have mechanized the art of conducting to an awful degree, in the quest of perfection rather than of dream [...] As soon as rubato is obtained and calculated scientifically, it ceases to be true. Music making is something else than searching to achieve an accomplishment. But striving to attain it is beautiful. Some of Michelangelo's sculptures are perfect, others are just outlined and the latter ones move me more than the first perfect ones because here I find the essence of desire, of the wakening dream. That's what really moves me: fixing without freezing in cement, allowing chance its opportunity.|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, Dragon Quest III {{introduced}} a character progression system allowing the player {{to change the}} party's character classes {{during the course of}} the game, and keep a character's stats and skills learned from previous classes. This class-changing system shaped the gameplay of future console RPGs, especially the Final Fantasy series, while predating the similar class-changing system that later appeared in [...] and [...] While the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non-linear, Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open-world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games. It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will, and another [...] "major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day." [...] Final Fantasy II, is considered [...] "the first true Final Fantasy game", introducing an [...] "emotional story line, morally ambiguous characters, tragic events," [...] and a story to be [...] "emotionally experienced rather than concluded from gameplay and conversations."

Final Fantasy II also featured open-ended exploration, and had a dialogue system where keywords or phrases can be memorized and mentioned during conversations with NPCs, the theme of an evil empire against a small band of rebels (similar to Star Wars), and the iconic chocobo, a fictional creature inspired by Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.
