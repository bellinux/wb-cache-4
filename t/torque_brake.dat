40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> {{distribution}} strategy for electric {{vehicles equipped with}} a hybrid hydraulic braking and regenerative braking system. The <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> distribution strategy is proposed based on the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> and the regenerative braking system 2 ̆ 7 s status. To get the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque,</b> a new strategy is designed based on the road conditions and driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions. Through the estimated road surface, a robust wheel slip controller is designed to calculate the overall maximum <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> required for the anti-lock braking system (ABS) under this road condition. Driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions are classified as the emergency braking and the normal braking. In the case of emergency braking, the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> is to be equal to the overall maximum <b>braking</b> <b>torque.</b> In the case of normal braking, the command <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> {{is proportional to the}} pedal stroke. Then the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> is chosen as the smaller one between the overall maximum <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> and the command <b>braking</b> <b>torque.</b> To acquire both high regenerative efficiency and good braking performance when the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> is smaller than the maximum <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> of the regenerative braking system, the whole <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> can be provided by the regenerative braking system; when the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> is bigger than the maximum <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> of the regenerative braking system, the whole <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> can be provided by both the hydraulic braking system and the regenerative braking system, while the maximum <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> of the regenerative braking system is obtained based on the battery state of charge (SOC) and vehicle speed in real-time.

The research is conducted by varying injection timing at constant engine speed and load while measuring engine emissions and in-cylinder pressure, revealing the premixed and diffusion burn fractions as well as important engine and exhaust design criteria such as maximum in-cylinder pressure and exhaust composition.

One dimensional simulation was conducted using the renowned commercial software for diesel and its blend fuels with 5 % (E 5) and 10 % ethanol (E 10) (in vol.) under full load condition at variable engine speed ranging from 1000 to 2750 rpm with 250 rpm increment. The model was then validated with other researcher’s experimental result. Model consists of intake and exhaust systems, cylinder, head, valves and port geometries. Performance tests were conducted for volumetric efficiency, brake engine <b>torque,</b> <b>brake</b> power, brake mean effective pressure, brake specific fuel consumption, and brake thermal efficiency, while exhaust emissions were analyzed for carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (HC. The results showed that blending diesel with ethanol increases the volumetric efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption and brake thermal efficiency, while it decreases brake engine <b>torque,</b> <b>brake</b> power and brake mean effective pressure. In term of emission characteristics, the CO emissions concentrations in the engine exhaust decrease significantly with ethanol as additive.
