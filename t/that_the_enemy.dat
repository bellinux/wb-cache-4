5|$|By June 1942, Royal Navy commanders {{considered}} that camouflage was largely unnecessary, given <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> would be using RDF and submarine hydrophones. In April 1943, the Admiralty decided that diffused lighting was impractical, and development was halted, though discussions continued with the Canadian Navy.|$|E
5|$|The J79 engines {{produced}} noticeable {{amounts of}} black smoke (at mid-throttle/cruise settings), a severe disadvantage in <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> could spot the aircraft. This was solved on the F-4S fitted with the −10A engine variant which used a smokeless combustor.|$|E
5|$|Instead {{of being}} sobered by their 3,000 casualties, Archduke John {{and his staff}} became {{convinced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> was on the run. The Austrian general ordered a pursuit of the French through forested terrain. But, instead of fleeing, Moreau and his troops {{were waiting for the}} Austrians. The two armies met in the decisive Battle of Hohenlinden two days later.|$|E

5|$|A March 1779 {{letter from}} Washington to Scott, still on {{furlough}} in Virginia, {{ordered him to}} recruit volunteers in Virginia and join Washington at Middlebrook on May 1. Men and supplies proved difficult to obtain, delaying Scott's return; during the delay, Washington ordered the recruits to South Carolina to join Benjamin Lincoln, who was {{in command of the}} militia forces there. Reports of significant British troop movements toward Georgia had convinced Washington <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> was preparing an invasion from the south.|$|E
5|$|American {{analysts were}} elated when they {{discovered}} {{that the number of}} trucks ordered by North Vietnam from its communist allies in late 1971 exceeded those of previous years. 6,000 vehicles had been ordered from the Soviet Union alone (as opposed to the usual 3,000) and this seemed to indicate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> was hurting for transportation and that the campaign was working. However, since 80 percent of the vehicles arrived in North Vietnam at least six weeks before the launching of the Nguyen Hue Offensive (known to the U.S. as the Easter Offensive, they probably reflected anticipated losses.|$|E
5|$|By September, several Blenheims were {{equipped}} {{with what was}} now officially known as AI Mk. I and training of the crews began with No. 25 Squadron at RAF Northolt. Robert Hanbury Brown, a physicist who would later work on radar in the US, and Keith Wood joined them in August 1939, helping fitters keep the systems operational, {{and coming up with}} useful methods for interception. Near the end of August, Dowding visited the base and saw the radars in the nose and pointed out to Bowen <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> gunners would see the light from the CRTs and shoot the operator. The sets were re-fitted once again, returning {{to the rear of the}} fuselage, which caused more delays.|$|E

5|$|Lee's {{original}} {{plan called for}} Hood and McLaws to attack in concert, but Longstreet held back McLaws while Hood's attack progressed. Around 5 p.m., Longstreet saw that Hood's division was reaching its limits and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> to its front was fully engaged. He ordered McLaws to send in Kershaw's brigade, with Barksdale's to follow on the left, beginning the en echelon attackone brigade after another in sequencethat {{would be used for}} the rest of the afternoon's attack. McLaws resented Longstreet's hands-on management of his brigades. Those brigades engaged in some of the bloodiest fighting of the battle: the Wheatfield and the Peach Orchard.|$|E
5|$|Still {{in pursuit}} of the debris of the enemy force, late on 13 February, Napoleon {{received}} reports that Marmont's Corps had been attacked and pushed out of his position at Étoges. The Emperor deduced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> force before him {{would have to be a}} much reduced one and promptly decided to go to Marmont's aid. The Emperor left Château-Thierry on 14 February, towards 3 o'clock in the morning, leaving a small portion of his forces with Marshal Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise, with orders to continue the pursuit of the enemy. Taking with him the cavalry of the Guard and Grouchy's Cavalry Reserve, Napoleon headed for the village of Vauchamps.|$|E
5|$|The Navy's {{experience}} in this war was encouraging in that it had won but also cautionary in <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> {{had one of the}} weakest of the world's modern fleets. Also, the Manila Bay attack was extremely risky in which the American ships could have incurred severe damage or run out of supplies, as they were 7,000 miles from the nearest American harbor. That would {{have a profound effect on}} Navy strategy and American foreign policy for next several decades.|$|E

50|$|As of 2008, {{there is}} a remake {{available}} for the PC, with enhanced graphics, sound and music taken from the film's theatrical score. Gameplay remains unchanged. Another difference is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> are more plentiful than the original.|$|R
5|$|By March, Clarke's {{deception}} operations {{had grown}} {{and it was}} decided to create a formal department. He chose the name Advanced Headquarters 'A' Force - the 'A' being a subtle reference to airborne - in the hope that it would help support the existence of paratroopers in the area (as well as hide the true purpose of the department). Clarke continued actively promoting the existence of 1st SAS until around June 1941, and it appears that Axis commanders accepted the brigade as real. Clarke had created the unit with no specific aims, although it did mean <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> command had to factor the existence of airborne troops into any battle plan. However, Abeam and the 1st SAS represented his first attempt at inflating the apparent strength of Allied forces, a tactic he would use significantly over the rest of the war. The brigade occasionally featured in Clarke's tactical deceptions; such as a March 1941 threat to Axis supply lines near Tripoli.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeated}} army suffered greatly, {{not only}} from the Byzantine pursuit, but also due to lack of water: before the battle, Kardarigan had ordered the water supplies poured to the ground, trying to make his men fight harder to break through the Byzantine army and reach the Arzamon. In addition, the surviving Persians were refused entry into Dara since, according to Simocatta, Persian custom forbade entrance to fugitives. Simocatta also narrates that many Persians died of thirst or from water poisoning when they drank too much water from wells after their ordeal. Kardarigan himself had managed to find refuge on a nearby hilltop with a small detachment and withstood several Byzantine attacks. Finally, after three or four days, the Byzantines, not aware <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> commander was there, abandoned the effort. Kardarigan thus escaped, although his men suffered further casualties in the process, up to a thousand according to Simocatta, from Byzantine patrols.|$|E
5|$|Cornelio Saavedra {{was aware}} that the Junta would be {{resisted}} by factions still loyal to the old authorities. It was resisted locally by the Cabildo and the Royal Audiencia; the nearby plazas of Montevideo and Paraguay did not recognize it; and Santiago de Liniers organized a counter-revolution at Córdoba. During this early period, the Junta worked united against the royalist threats. Mariano Moreno, the secretary of war, drafted the decrees and regulations to deal with royalists. First, a decree ordered punishment for anyone attempting to generate disputes, and for those concealing conspiracies against the Junta or other people. The Royal Audiencia swore loyalty to the Regency Council, in defiance to the Junta, so they were summoned, along with former viceroy Cisneros, and exiled to Spain with the pretext {{that there was a}} threat to their lives. The Junta appointed new members for the Audiencia loyal to the revolution. Moreno organized as well the Paraguay campaign and the First Upper Peru campaign, to the plazas that resisted the Junta. The second one, headed by Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo, would move to Córdoba and attack the counter-revolution; before marching to Upper Peru. Ocampo's initial orders were to capture the counter-revolutionary leaders and send them to Buenos Aires, so that they could be judged. When the counter-revolution became stronger Moreno called the Junta and proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> leaders should be shot {{as soon as they were}} captured instead of brought to trial. The new orders were carried out by Juan José Castelli. Cornelio Saavedra supported all these measures.|$|E

5000|$|Nelson {{was careful}} {{to point out that}} {{something}} had to be left to chance.

[...] In short, circumstances would dictate the execution, subject to <b>the</b> guiding rule <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> rear was to be cut off and superior force concentrated on <b>that</b> part of <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> line.|$|R

25|$|Again on 4 August the Regiment marched from Memphis, {{with the}} rest of General Smith’s command, for Holly Springs, where after being {{detained}} a few days, the force moved on to Oxford, Mississippi.

50|$|The 2002 Army Combatives manual {{dictates}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fighter {{should first}} ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> head goes underneath {{one of their}} arms.

With the other hand, the fighter grasps the first hand, ensuring {{that they have not}} reached around <b>the</b> <b>enemy's</b> arm, and pulls upward with both hands. They now sit down and place <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> within their guard, and finish the choke by pulling with their arms and pushing with their legs.|$|R
