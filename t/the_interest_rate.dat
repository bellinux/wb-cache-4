5|$|In economics, the {{loanable funds}} {{doctrine}} {{is a theory}} of the market interest rate. According to this approach, <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> {{is determined by the}} demand for and supply of loanable funds. The term loanable funds includes all forms of credit, such as loans, bonds, or savings deposits.|$|E
5|$|Uncovered {{interest}} rate parity asserts that an investor with dollar deposits will earn <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> available on dollar deposits, while an investor holding euro deposits will earn <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> {{available in the}} eurozone, but also a potential gain or loss on euros depending on the rate of appreciation or depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Economists have extrapolated a useful approximation of uncovered {{interest rate}} parity that follows intuitively from these assumptions. If uncovered interest rate parity holds, such that an investor is indifferent between dollar versus euro deposits, then any excess return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected loss from depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Conversely, some shortfall in return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected gain from appreciation of the euro against the dollar. The following equation represents the uncovered interest rate parity approximation.|$|E
5|$|Marguerite Louise's extravagances perturbed Ferdinando {{because the}} Tuscan {{exchequer}} was nearly bankrupt; {{it was so}} empty that when the Wars of Castro mercenaries were paid for, the state {{could no longer afford}} to pay interest on government bonds. Accordingly, <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> was lowered by 0.75%. The economy, too, was so decrepit that barter trade became prevalent in rural market places. In August 1663 Marguerite Louise delivered a boy: Ferdinando. Two more children followed: Anna Maria Luisa in 1667 and Gian Gastone in 1671.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> CIR <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> model characterizes <b>the</b> {{short-term}} <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> as a mean-reverting stochastic projection.

Below is the formula.|$|R
5|$|The {{loanable funds}} {{doctrine}} extends the classical theory, which determined <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> solely by savings and investment, {{in that it}} adds bank credit. The total amount of credit available in an economy can exceed private savings because the bank system {{is in a position}} to create credit out of thin air. Hence, the equilibrium (or market) interest rate is not only influenced by the propensities to save and invest but also by the creation or destruction of fiat money and credit.|$|E
5|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{that results}} from the relationship between forward and spot exchange rates {{within the context of}} covered interest rate parity is responsible for eliminating or correcting for market inefficiencies that would create potential for arbitrage profits. As such, arbitrage opportunities are fleeting. In order for this equilibrium to hold under differences in interest rates between two countries, the forward exchange rate must generally differ from the spot exchange rate, such that a no-arbitrage condition is sustained. Therefore, the forward rate is said to contain a premium or discount, reflecting <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> differential between two countries. The following equations demonstrate how the forward premium or discount is calculated.|$|E
5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate (also referred to as forward rate or forward price) is the exchange rate at which a bank agrees to exchange one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a forward contract with an investor. Multinational corporations, banks, and other financial institutions enter into forward contracts {{to take advantage of}} the forward rate for hedging purposes. The {{forward exchange}} rate is determined by a parity relationship among the spot exchange rate and differences in interest rates between two countries, which reflects an economic equilibrium in the foreign exchange market under which arbitrage opportunities are eliminated. When in equilibrium, and when interest rates vary across two countries, the parity condition implies that the forward rate includes a premium or discount reflecting <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> differential. Forward exchange rates have important theoretical implications for forecasting future spot exchange rates. Financial economists have put forth a hypothesis that the forward rate accurately predicts the future spot rate, for which empirical evidence is mixed.|$|E

5000|$|By specifying , the Taylor rule {{says that}} an {{increase}} in inflation by one percentage point should prompt the central bank to raise <b>the</b> nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> {{by more than one}} percentage point (specifically, by , the sum of the two coefficients on [...] in the equation above). Since <b>the</b> real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> is (approximately) <b>the</b> nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> minus inflation, stipulating [...] implies that when inflation rises, <b>the</b> real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> should be increased. The idea that <b>the</b> real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> should be raised to cool the economy when inflation increases (requiring <b>the</b> nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> to increase more than inflation does) has sometimes been called the Taylor principle.|$|R

5|$|In {{the interim}} between the Import Duties Act and the Ottawa Conference, Chamberlain {{presented}} his first budget, in April 1932. The gold standard {{had been abandoned}} {{in the early days}} of the National Government; the Bank of England sought its restoration. Chamberlain, on advice from his officials, declined to restore the gold standard, realising that a devalued pound would improve the balance of trade. Otherwise, Chamberlain maintained the severe budget cuts that had been agreed to at the inception of the National Government: Chamberlain cut means-tested benefits and public sector wages, which proved to be an unpopular move. He also cut interest rates, which led to a house-building boom in the south of England and supported plans to clear slums. Interest on the war debt had been a major cost in each budget. Chamberlain was able to reduce <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> on most of Britain's war debt from 5% to 3.5%. Between 1932 and 1938, Chamberlain halved the percentage of the budget devoted to payment of interest on the war debt.|$|E
5|$|Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E

50|$|The {{horizontal}} axis represents national income or real {{gross domestic product}} and is labelled Y. The vertical axis represents <b>the</b> real <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> r. Since this is a non-dynamic model, there is a fixed relationship between <b>the</b> nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and <b>the</b> real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> (<b>the</b> former equals the latter plus the expected inflation rate which is exogenous in the short run); therefore variables such as money demand which actually depend on <b>the</b> nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> can equivalently be expressed as depending on <b>the</b> real <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|R
