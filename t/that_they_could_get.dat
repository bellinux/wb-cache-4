5|$|Meanwhile, Leonard, Raj, and Howard {{attempt to}} solve their Comic-Con problem by {{illegally}} buying scalped tickets. After arranging for a scalper to come to Leonard's apartment, they begin to get worried, remembering Sheldon's warning <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> charged for petty theft, then have to disclose the crime in the future. When the scalper is heard arriving, they quickly turn off the lights and stay silent.|$|E
5|$|The O class' design {{reflected}} {{their intended}} role; a heavy main armament (six 380mm guns in three dual turrets) for possible encounters with escorting -armed heavy cruisers, enough armor {{to defend against}} the same and nothing more, and a high top speed so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> away from slower but much better armored capital ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Rich Moore. Barney's apartment, which Homer spends the night in when he is kicked out by Marge, is partly based on an apartment Jim Reardon, Moore, {{and a few other}} animators of The Simpsons shared in college. One of the strip clubs Homer and Bart visit when they are trying to find Princess Kashmir is based on the Seventh Veil Strip Club in Los Angeles, California. The staff went around Hollywood taking pictures of strip clubs so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> inspiration for the interior design of the strip club buildings in Springfield. The character designer designed over fifty different international showgirl costumes for the showgirls in the burlesque show sequence. Carl Carlson made his first appearance on The Simpsons in this episode.|$|E

5|$|At the time, much of {{the rural}} ricelands had been {{abandoned}} due to war and lay fallow. The Americans pressured Diem to assume control of such lands and distribute it to the new settlers and {{to allow them to}} start their new lives and ease the overcrowding in the camps, but no action was taken in 1954. At the time, there was a severe wastage of personnel due to the placement of refugees in land that was inappropriate to them. Vietnamese officials had resolved to place the settlers in land similar to their northern origins so that they could be productive, but bureaucratic difficulties hampered COMIGAL and no plan was produced. Throughout 1954, 60% of the new arrivals identified themselves as having an agrarian background, but only 20% of the total refugees were placed in arable farming areas, meaning that at least 40% of the northerners were in areas not appropriate for their skill set. There were also severe problems in finding and then distributing farming equipment to the northerners so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> to work and resuscitate the agricultural sector that was hindered by the war.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 2002 Aspect {{published}} Alan Grant's Smallville: Dragon, {{about an}} ex-convict who assumes the abilities and {{appearance of a}} dragon after he is exposed to kryptonite in a cave; the mutation drives {{him to try to}} kill everyone who testified against him. In the novel, Clark is hypnotized into believing that he is a normal teenager with no special abilities. A month after the publication of Grant's novel Bennett and Gottesfeld wrote Little, Brown Young Readers' Flight, about a young girl (Tia) who Clark discovers has wings. He and his friends believe that Tia is being abused by her father, and teach her to overcome her fear of flying so she can find her mother. Flight (like See No Evil) was a planned episode, but the crew was uncertain <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> the flying effects right and the idea was scrapped. Nancy Holder wrote the third novel in the Aspect series. Published on January 1, 2003, Hauntings follows Clark and his friends as they investigate a ghostly presence in a Smallville house. Little, Brown Young Readers then published Animal Rage by David and Bobby Weiss, about animal-rights activist Heather Fox (who can change into any animal she touches). Heather uses this ability to harm people who hurt animals until Clark discovers it and stops her. Aspect published Dean Wesley Smith's Whodunit, in which Clark, Chloe, Lana and Pete investigate the murder of a boy and his sister while Lex tries to decide whether to ransom his kidnapped father or try rescuing Lionel himself.|$|E
25|$|The Banu Musa also invented an {{automatic}} flute player {{which may have}} been the first programmable machine. The flute sounds were produced through hot steam and the user could adjust the device to various patterns so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> various sounds from it.|$|E
5000|$|Reviewing a pre-release {{copy of the}} single, Filter {{magazine}} {{said the}} song contained [...] "Morrissey’s classic croon" [...] and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> enough of it.|$|R

25|$|While {{attempting}} to make a living, they began to experiment with tape machines, photography, and anything remotely to do with art <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> their hands on. Word of their experimentation spread and in 1969, a British guitarist and multi-instrumentalist named Phil Lithman and the mysterious (and perhaps apocryphal) N. Senada (whom Lithman had picked up in Bavaria where the aged avant-gardist was recording birds singing) paid them a visit, and decided to remain.|$|E
25|$|In 1994 {{the company}} was still having {{financial}} difficulties. There were rumours that Euro Disney was getting close to having to declare bankruptcy. The banks and the backers had meetings to work {{out some of the}} financial problems facing Euro Disney. It was in March 1994 that Team Disney went into negotiations with the banks so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> some help for their debt. As a last resort, the Walt Disney Company threatened to close the Disneyland Paris park, leaving the banks with the land.|$|E
25|$|The Provisional IRA {{claimed that}} they had put the bomb on the {{aircraft}} but that {{it had never been}} intended to detonate but to show <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> through the security at Belfast Airport. The way in which the bomb gained access to the aircraft remains unknown. Three police officers from the Royal Ulster Constabulary were on board the flight. The Chief Constable of Northern Ireland, James Flanagan together {{with his wife and two}} police officers with their families were travelling to London to attend an investiture; the two officers were to receive the British Empire Medal from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace for their work during the Northern Ireland Troubles. The MP James Molyneaux, Chief Whip for the Ulster Unionist Party and a senior member of the Orange Order was also on the flight. Bob Rae, who would later become Premier of the Canadian province of Ontario and leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, was also a passenger.|$|E

25|$|Arabs relying {{largely on}} Berbers conquered the Iberian Peninsula {{starting}} in 711, subduing the whole Visigothic Kingdom by 725. The triumphant Umayyads got conditional capitulations probably {{in most of}} the towns, so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a compromise with the native population. This was not always so. For example, Mérida, Cordova, Toledo, or Narbonne were conquered by storm or after laying siege on them. The arrangement reached with the locals was based on respecting the laws and traditions used in each place, so that the Goths (a legal concept, not an ethnic one, i.e. the communities ruled by the Forum Iudicum) continued to be ruled on new conditions by their own tribunals and laws. The Gothic Church remained in place and collaborated with the new masters. Al-Andalus or Muslim ruled Iberian peninsula, was conquered by northern Christian kingdoms in 1492, {{as a result of their}} expansion taking place especially after the definite collapse of the Caliphate of Cordova in 1031.|$|E
500|$|Friedgen {{stated that}} the curfew {{violations}} occurred over several nights, and that different players violated the rule to separate degrees. He informed Maryland athletic director Deborah Yow of the infractions and initially suggested sending all of the curfew violators back to Maryland by bus. Yow dissented, and they agreed to suspend the players {{for part of the}} game. Describing the incident, Friedgen said that [...] "Five percent of [...] guys thought they didn't need to listen to me, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> bed checked and sneak out." [...] He added, [...] "But I checked again at 1 o'clock. [...] "This is not my first rodeo." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the writing}} process, the [...] "Yoda" [...] {{character}} gradually became younger. Taylor later explained {{that this was}} not a specific decision but instead something that just occurred naturally. Casting director Ron Surma contacted agents of a few well known actors in the hope <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a notable actor to portray the character, now named Arturis. One of those actors who were not required to audition was Ray Wise, as he had previously appeared in the [...] episode [...] "Who Watches the Watchers". Meanwhile, Taylor and Braga auditioned over 50 unknown actors. The crew hoped to get a classically trained actor, as they wanted to ensure that they did not show any 20th-century mannerisms in the portrayal of a futuristic character.|$|E
25|$|Title IX made {{it easier}} to move civil rights cases from state courts to federal court. This was of crucial {{importance}} to civil rights activists who contended <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> fair trials in state courts.|$|R
60|$|It {{was easy}} to get Anderson Rover to explain, but {{not so easy to}} get him to consent to their going out to Colorado. At last he said <b>that</b> if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> Jack Wumble to go with them they might go.|$|R
50|$|At {{school the}} next day, Giles prepares to leave for a Watchers' retreat. He warns Buffy about seeing Angel and she {{promises}} that nothing will happen between them. Xander tells Willow that he wishes <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> just <b>get</b> rid of their mutual attraction.|$|R
500|$|Further {{changes were}} made after the March 2007 preview {{screenings}} of the film in Portland, Oregon and Phoenix, Arizona. This included the deletion of Kang and Kodos heavily criticizing the film during the end credits. A lot {{of people at the}} screenings found the original film too coarse, and some of Homer's behavior too unkind, so several scenes were toned down to make him appear nicer. Russ Cargill was redesigned several times, originally appearing as an older man whose speech patterns Albert Brooks based on Donald Rumsfeld. The older model was the one used by Burger King for the action figure. Cargill's scene with Bart and Homer at the film's conclusion was added in to fully resolve his story, and the [...] "Spider-Pig" [...] gag was also a late addition. One excised scene, before the dome is put over Springfield, had Mr. Burns reminding viewers that it was the last point in the film <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a refund. Other deletions included Homer's encounter with a sausage truck driver, which was featured on the DVD, a scene with Plopper the pig at the end, and a news report, showing the dome's effect on daily life in Springfield in areas such as farming and sport, was cut because it did not fit the overall context of the film. Several musical numbers, at various intervals throughout the film, were cut. These included a song about Alaska, featuring music by Dave Stewart of Eurythmics. Jean said it [...] "got pretty far along in the animation, and then we got scared that the movie began to drag in that section." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} The Office website {{included three}} cut scenes from [...] "Golden Ticket". One 72-second clip includes Michael eavesdropping from the men's bathroom on Angela, Oscar, Kelly and Meredith, who discuss how unfair Michael is treating Dwight in making him take the fall over the failed golden ticket promotion. Kelly {{also makes the}} remark, [...] "I hope Dwight gets fired and they get a hot new guy to replace him," [...] to which Oscar replies, [...] "Seriously." [...] In another 52-second scene, Michael asks Dwight {{to go on a}} stroll, but Dwight suggests turning it into a [...] "power stroll", which he prepares Michael for by applying sunscreen to his face. And in a follow-up to the scene where workers discuss that Michael should be fired, a visibly angry and upset Michael confronts the office. When he says [...] "Can any of you imagine this office without me?" [...] everyone gleefully raises their hands, but Michael then asks them if they've thought about what kind of terrible person they could get to replace him; he then pointedly says <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> someone who knows they don't actually need three accountants (Oscar, Kevin, and Angela look visibly ashamed that Michael knew this going back to Season 2's Halloween episode but has never taken any action about it) or someone who doesn't approve of romantic relationships and would transfer one or both people having one to separate branches (Jim and Pam in turn get this message and look thoughtful), and tells the office that they should mind what they're saying about him [...] "when I'm hiding in the bathroom pretending to be pooping." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the {{characters}} were separated on screen, they had gained a fan {{base on the}} Internet that believed Martha should be with Jack and wanted the pair to reunite. Gordon herself backed the pairing, stating that she believed they should be together. She said: [...] "I actually love Jack and Martha together, I'm a sucker for romance so, I want {{want them to be}} together [...] I want them to continue on, [...] the timing is not right, they are not mature enough. Jack's in a relationship with someone else as Martha is, there just seems to be things {{getting in the way of}} them getting back together all the time." [...] Gordon also hoped for a happy ending for the two characters if they were to ever leave the serial adding: [...] "If I had it my way, and I got to write the scripts then I'd make it happily ever after, Martha and Jack riding off into the sunset." [...] Gordon has spoken of her understanding from the audiences point of view, that together Jack and Martha are [...] "the ultimate couple". She also reiterated her belief that it would be to tough at the time of Martha's downward spiral for them to work together, but if Martha is to get through her troubles and have a happy ending, that it would be with Jack. The Daily Telegraph commented on the Martha and Jack situation, saying it is played out in a [...] "classic soapie technique". They said [...] "Bring {{the characters}} together, push them apart, but always leave open the possibility <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> back together. It has worked for Days of Our Lives John Black and Marlena Evans".|$|E
60|$|Dick and Tom {{walked down}} to the stream.

50|$|Books-A-Million {{was founded}} in 1917 in Florence, Alabama as a {{newsstand}} by 14-year old Clyde B. Anderson, {{who dropped out of}} school to support his family after his father died.

60|$|The man {{replied that}} he was very sorry, but that those were his instructions.

2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Drowned in Sound in June 2009, Bixler-Zavala stated {{that he had been}} in discussions with the band's former members and suggested <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> back together after they sorted their financial business out. He added, [...] "I wouldn't mind it. It might happen, we just have to iron out a lot of personal things. A lot of it we've dealt with already and I've apologized for a lot of things I've said and the way it ended... we'll see what happens." ...|$|E
2500|$|Domestic {{violence}} {{may happen}} in immigrant communities, and often {{there is little}} awareness in these communities of the laws and policies of the host country. A study among first generation South Asians in the UK found that they had little knowledge about what constituted criminal behavior under the English law. The researchers found that [...] "There was certainly no awareness {{that there could be}} rape within a marriage". A study in Australia showed that among the immigrant women sampled who were abused by partners and did not report it, 16.7% did not know DV was illegal, while 18.8% did not know <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> protection.|$|E
2500|$|As well as {{yielding}} {{many more}} available numbers, {{it was a}} handy way for vehicle buyers to know {{the age of the}} vehicle immediately. However, the year letter changing on 1 January each year meant that car retailers soon started to notice that buyers would tend to wait until the New Year for the new letter to be issued, so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a [...] "newer" [...] car. This led to major peaks and troughs in sales over the year, and to help flatten this out somewhat the industry lobbied to get the scheme changed, so that the change of year letter occurred on 1 August rather than 1 January. This was done in 1967, when [...] "E" [...] suffixes ran only from 1 January to 31 July, before [...] "F" [...] suffixes commenced on 1 August.|$|E
60|$|In {{the midst}} of all this they met a {{wonderful}} vessel--it was a dough-trough, in which there sat an old woman. She called to them, and said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> still <b>get</b> to shore alive if they would promise her the son that was next to come to their mother the queen.|$|R
50|$|The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) {{loosened}} mortgage {{restrictions in}} the mid-1990s so first-time buyers could qualify for loans <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> never <b>get</b> before. In 1995, the GSE began receiving affordable housing credit for purchasing mortgage backed securities which included loans to low income borrowers. This resulted in the agencies purchasing subprime securities.|$|R
50|$|The {{usefulness}} of special forces units was reaffirmed. British special forces destroyed many Argentine aircraft (notably in the SAS raid on Pebble Island) {{and carried out}} highly informative intelligence-gathering operations. Contrary to popular understanding, the Argentine special forces also patrolled hard, in appalling climatic conditions, against a professional enemy and showed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> sometimes <b>get</b> the upper hand.|$|R
