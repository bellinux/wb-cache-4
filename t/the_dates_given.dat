25|$|Whether {{there is}} any {{historical}} reality behind the Trojan War remains an open question.

500|$|If <b>the</b> <b>dates</b> <b>given</b> by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle are {{accurate}} to within half a century, then Ælle's reign {{lies in the}} middle of the Anglo-Saxon expansion, and prior to the final conquest of the Britons. It also seems consistent with <b>the</b> <b>dates</b> <b>given</b> to assume that Ælle's battles predate Mons Badonicus.This in turn would explain the long gap, of fifty or more years, in the succession of the [...] "bretwaldas": if the peace gained by the Britons did indeed hold till the second half of the 6th century, it is not to be expected that an Anglo-Saxon leader should have anything resembling overlordship of England during that time. The idea of a pause in the Anglo-Saxon advance is also supported by the account in Procopius of 6th century migration from Britain to the kingdom of the Franks. [...] Procopius's account is consistent with what is known to be a contemporary colonization of Armorica (now Brittany, in France); the settlers appear to have been at least partly from Dumnonia (modern Cornwall), and the area acquired regions known as Dumnonée and Cornouaille. [...] It seems likely that something at that time was interrupting the general flow of the Anglo-Saxons from the continent to Britain.|$|E
500|$|Penda (died 15 November 655) Others have {{accepted}} Bede's given dates as meaning what {{they appear to}} mean, considering Bede's year to have begun on 25 December or 1 January (see S. Wood, 1983: [...] "Bede's Northumbrian dates again"). The historian D. P. Kirby suggested the year 656 as a possibility, alongside 655, in case <b>the</b> <b>dates</b> <b>given</b> by Bede are off by one year (see Kirby's [...] "Bede and Northumbrian Chronology", 1963). The Annales Cambriae gives the year as 657. [...] was a 7th-century King of Mercia, the Anglo-Saxon kingdom in what is today the English Midlands. A pagan {{at a time when}} Christianity was taking hold in many of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, Penda took over the Severn Valley in 628 following the Battle of Cirencester before participating in the defeat of the powerful Northumbrian king Edwin at the Battle of Hatfield Chase in 633.|$|E
500|$|Bede, in his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, says of Penda {{that he was}} [...] "a most warlike man of {{the royal}} race of the Mercians" [...] and that, {{following}} Edwin of Northumbria's defeat in 633 (see below), he ruled the Mercians for 22 years with varying fortune. The noted 20th-century historian Frank Stenton was {{of the opinion that}} the language used by Bede [...] "leaves no doubt that ... Penda, though descended from the royal family of the Mercians, only became their king after Edwin's defeat". The Historia Brittonum accords Penda a reign of only ten years, perhaps dating it {{from the time of the}} Battle of Maserfield (see below) around 642, although according to the generally accepted chronology this would still be more than ten years. Given the apparent problems with <b>the</b> <b>dates</b> <b>given</b> by the Chronicle and the Historia, Bede's account of the length of Penda's reign is generally considered the most plausible by historians. Nicholas Brooks noted that, since these three accounts of the length of Penda's reign come from three different sources, and none of them are Mercian (they are West Saxon, Northumbrian, and Welsh), they may merely reflect the times at which their respective peoples first had military involvement with Penda.|$|E
