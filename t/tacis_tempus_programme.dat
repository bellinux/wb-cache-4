It draws attention to the relatively poor international and bilateral support for library development compared with that formerly received by the ‘developing’ countries, despite their economic similarities. It notes that the activities of international governmental and non-governmental agencies to offset the catastrophic effects of the disintegration of the centralized Soviet system have lacked coordination, and emphasizes the need for national governments to be encouraged to take a comprehensive, strategic approach to ensure more sustainable development of their library and information services, suggesting that this approach could be appropriate for the other post-Soviet Republics.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a preliminary analysis of TEMPUS {{contribution to the}} development and upgrading of the higher education sector in Syria. By comparing the priorities of Syrian higher education sector and the objectives of thirty three TEMPUS projects implemented in Syria, the study shows different levels of contribution of each project to the national priorities. An innovative concept of the National Project based on two dimensions was suggested. The two dimensions are the number of national priorities that the project meets, {{and the number of}} Syrian higher education institutions involved in each project. It is found that more than 50 % of these projects meet the national priorities, and an individual project is relatively serving a few number of universities. In accordance with the concept of the national project that was proposed in this study, the results insist on the need for more national-oriented projects in the future. To guarantee the sustainability of the Programme, the study suggests that <b>TEMPUS</b> <b>Programme</b> should stress on developing more national-oriented projects based on the concept of the national project suggested in this study. However, from macro point of view, the results indicate that <b>TEMPUS</b> <b>Programme</b> could be considered as a national Programme. Empirically, this study provides decision makers of the higher education sector in Syria with relevant information regarding the intended future directions of the projects, and their contribution to the higher education development process...|$|R

The paper is based on a review of the published literature and data gathered during the implementation of the project, and addresses {{a wide range of issues}} that were encountered. It provides some background information on the country, the state of publishing and bookselling, and the dissemination of research results; briefly describes the development of libraries and information services, and professional education; outlines the international development assistance that they have received during the last twenty years; describes their current situation; and indicates some of their future needs. It notes that, while the activities of international governmental and non-governmental agencies to offset the catastrophic effects of the disintegration of the centralised Soviet system may have lacked coordination, the national government of Uzbekistan appears to be taking a more strategic approach to the development of its library and information services.

The Universities involved in the collaboration are the University of Strathclyde, the University of Rome (La Sapienza), the University Polytechnic of Catalunya and the University of Zagreb.  The unique character of Split, catalogued by the University of Zagreb and the Split Institute of Urban Planning, owes much to the decision of the Emperor Deocletia to build his Palace on the coast south of Salona - which in the 4 th century was the capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia. The Slav invasion of the 6 th century drove citizens from Salonia south to Split to found a new city.  After being dominated by the Byzantine Empire, Split then enjoyed free commune status, and subsequently became part of the Republic of Venice.

40|$|The aim {{of present}} {{research}} was to conceptualize the way the European level political incentives are transferred to the national level and acquire their practical embodiment in domestic policy practices and developments. Policy transfer and policy network are the core concepts placed in {{the centre of the}} theoretical framework of the research. Through the prism of these concepts the major issue of the Bologna process ideas transfer to the level of national higher education policy formulation is explored. The object of the study is the higher education system of the Republic of Moldova. Moldova joined the Bologna Process in 2005. Key developments since then include: implementing the new two-cycle system in all higher education institutions from 2005 - 2006; introducing ECTS; drafting a new higher education law based on the concept of modernization; and approving a working plan for 2005 - 2010 to align the national higher education with Bologna principles. Policy transfer concept, operationalised into four variables, is applied to analyze the Bologna-related developments in the Republic of Moldova. The undertaken analysis has resulted in several basic findings. It has been concluded that the Bologna process ideas are predominately transferred to the state level by the internationally active higher education institutions of Moldova which, through the establishment of fruitful international collaboration with partner universities {{within the framework of the}} <b>Tempus</b> <b>programme,</b> essentially facilitate the incoming flow of European policies in the area of higher education.

40|$|With {{the ever}} {{increasing}} progress and achievement {{in science and}} technology it is evident that higher education is under pressure to continue to produce new generations of highly skilled individuals who will be capable of contributing further intellectual and technical advances in the 21 st century. Therefore, higher education (HE) systems around the globe are facing an enormous challenge to develop programmes that will help produce such scientific graduate leaders and the necessary new generations of scientists and technologists. To further this aim of developing modern scientists who are competitive on a world stage we have created a joint-project, funded by the European Union’s <b>TEMPUS</b> <b>programme,</b> which aims to respond to current societal needs to develop and modernise existing Chemistry programmes in Serbia with a view of making programme outcomes consistent with best practice in the rest of Europe. To achieve this aim the following objectives and work programmes have been formulated: • Revisit current benchmarking statements and align them with 21 st century needs. • Modernisation of the HE quality assurance (QA) system. • Staff development – both pedagogical and scientific. • Implementation of modern technologies in teaching practice. • Aligning assessment criteria and methodology with new teaching strategies. Higher education modernisation is often driven by its desire to establish the most effective ways of delivering teaching and learning. When talking about modernisation of curricula in the 21 st century we often think about the use of interactive boards, public response systems and virtual learning environments. Although, it is evident that computer aided teaching and learning processes are often dominant, implementation of new teaching strategies is often dictated by: • An effective understanding of how learners learn (teaching theories). • The desired learning outcomes (stake holders input) • Available tools (technologies). • Latest scientific discoveries (research informed teaching) ...|$|R

The purpose was to foster teamwork and produce better outcomes than those potentially achieved through individual work. We evaluated the results of these online courses on the basis of the course test results and students' evaluation questionnaires. [...] - RESULTS: Of 68 students enrolled in all e-courses, 97 % (n= 66) successfully passed the final exam. An anonymous online questionnaire was filled out by 83 % (n= 50) of the students. The majority expressed their satisfaction with the online electives, mostly because they had more contact with tutors and peers (n= 47), better possibilities of self-assessment (n= 38), more flexible learning (n= 33), better access to learning materials (n= 32), faster and easier information retrieval (n= 31), and better quality of communication with tutors and peers (n= 28). Although 38 of 50 students claimed that participating in e-courses was more demanding than participating in traditional electives, more than half (n= 27) would enroll in an e-course again.
