25|$|At the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) {{the debate}} on papal primacy and {{authority}} re-emerged, and in the dogmatic constitution Lumen gentium, the Roman Catholic Church's teaching on {{the authority of the}} pope, bishops and councils was further elaborated. Vatican II sought to correct the unbalanced ecclesiology left behind by Vatican I. The result is the body of <b>teaching</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> papacy and episcopacy contained in Lumen gentium.|$|E
25|$|Paul's <b>teaching</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> end of {{the world}} is {{expressed}} most clearly in his letters to the Christians at Thessalonica. He assures them that the dead will rise first and be followed by those left alive. This suggests an imminent end but he is unspecific about times and seasons, and encourages his hearers to expect a delay. The form of the end will be a battle between Jesus and the man of lawlessness whose conclusion is the triumph of Christ.|$|E

25|$|Terms {{with similar}} {{etymology}} {{are also used}} in various social sciences and humanities to describe patriarchal or patriological aspects of social, cultural and political processes. Adjective patriological {{is derived from the}} noun patriology that comes from two Greek words: πατέρας (pateras, father) and λογος (logos, <b>teaching</b> <b>about).</b> <b>The</b> term patriology originated in theological studies as a designation for particular theological discipline that studies the person and works of God the Father (see: Patriology (Christianity)). In modern times, the term was borrowed by social sciences and humanities and its meaning was widened in order to describe and define particular male-dominated and male-centered aspects of cultural and social life.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the first decision to omit these books entirely from the Bible was made by Protestant laity rather than clergy. Bibles dating from shortly after the Reformation have been found whose tables of contents included the entire Roman Catholic canon, but which did not actually contain the disputed books, leading some historians to think that the workers at the printing presses took it upon themselves to omit them. However, Anglican and Lutheran Bibles usually still contained these books until the 20th century, while Calvinist Bibles did not. Several reasons are proposed for the omission of these books from the canon. One is the support for Catholic doctrines such as Purgatory and Prayer for the dead found in 2 Maccabees. Luther himself said he was following Jerome's <b>teaching</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Veritas Hebraica.|$|E
500|$|Outside the school, Winn and a {{group of}} Bajorans protest Keiko's {{teaching}} methods. Winn offers Keiko a solution—all she has to do is simply stop <b>teaching</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> wormhole. When Keiko refuses to accept Winn's proposal, Winn leads the Bajoran parents to take their children out of school. Sisko visits Vedek Bareil (Philip Anglim) for advice on the problem. [...] Bareil opposes Winn's views but he cannot support Sisko as he is attempting to become the next Kai, the leader of the Bajoran religion. Sisko returns to DS9 and asks for help from Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor), but she also refuses to help. Meanwhile, Odo (René Auberjonois) and Doctor Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) finish investigating the remains of the Starfleet ensign Miles and Neela found earlier. [...] They discover that the ensign had been murdered by a phaser when he became aware of someone tampering with the Runabout security controls.|$|E

500|$|The text {{has been}} {{attributed}} to Christoph Birkmann by Christine Blanken of the Bach-Archiv Leipzig. He combined the topics of the readings, the gospel of the Flight into Egypt and <b>teaching</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> suffering of Christians from the First Epistle of Peter, in a structure of unusual symmetry with a duet as the first and last of the five movements. Both duets are dialogues of the Soul, represented by a soprano, and Jesus, sung by a bass as the [...] (voice of Christ). Both duets are set as a chorale fantasia, combining a stanza from a hymn, sung by the soprano as the cantus firmus, with original poetry set in counterpoint. Both stanzas are sung to the same melody, but come from different hymns, Martin Moller's [...] "Ach Gott, wie manches Herzeleid", and Martin Behm's [...] "". While the poet wrote the duets to fit the same music, Bach composed them in contrast, even changing the meter of the tune, to fit the different mood: lamenting heartbreak in the beginning, comfort in the end.|$|E
500|$|For Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin, a {{librettist}} {{kept the}} first and the last stanza and paraphrased the two inner stanzas in four movements. The second movement, based on Luther's second stanza, is focused on Simeon's perspective as a means of how to anticipate one's own death. The third movement interweaves Luther's complete text with a free recitative. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that the librettist had room to add his own text because Luther's hymn is rather short. The allusion to [...] "light for the heathen" [...] from the gospel and the hymn refers to [...] "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved" [...] (...) [...] Luther's third stanza forms the basis for the fourth and fifth movements. The fourth movement refers to Paul's <b>teaching</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> grace of God, ("Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God") (...) [...] It declares the Lutheran teaching of justification [...] "by grace alone through faith alone because of Christ alone" [...] even more clearly than Luther's song.|$|E
500|$|This commandment demands {{respect for}} human life and is more {{accurately}} translated as [...] "thou shalt not murder." [...] Indeed, killing may, under limited circumstances, be justified within Catholicism. Jesus expanded it to prohibit unjust anger, hatred and vengeance, and to require Christians to love their enemies. The basis of all Catholic <b>teaching</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fifth commandment is the sanctity of life ethic, which Kreeft argues is philosophically opposed {{to the quality of}} life ethic, a philosophy which he characterizes as introduced by a book entitled Die Freigabe der Vernichtung des Lebensunwerten Lebens (The Permission to Destroy Life Unworthy of Life) (see Life unworthy of life) and which he asserts was the [...] "first to win public acceptance... by German doctors before World War II—the basis and beginning of Nazi medical practices." [...] This interpretation is supported by modern medical journals that discuss the dilemma posed by these opposing philosophies to physicians who must make life or death decisions. Some bioethicists characterize the use of the [...] "Nazi analogy" [...] as inappropriate when applied to quality of life decisions; Arthur Caplan called this rhetoric [...] "odiously wrong". The Church is actively involved in the public debates over abortion, capital punishment and euthanasia, and encourages believers to support legislation and politicians it describes as pro-life.|$|E

500|$|In {{the wake}} of Nettles' death, Applewhite became {{increasingly}} paranoid, fearing a conspiracy against his group. One member who joined in the mid-1980s recalled that Applewhite avoided new converts, worrying that they were infiltrators. He feared a government raid on their home and spoke highly of the Jewish defenders of Masada in ancient Israel who showed total resistance to the Roman Empire. Increasingly, he began to discuss the Apocalypse, comparing the Earth to an overgrown garden {{that was to be}} recycled or rebooted and humanity to a failed experiment. In accordance with the garden metaphor, he stated that the Earth would be [...] "spaded under". Woodward notes that Applewhite's <b>teaching</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Earth's recycling is similar to the cyclical perspective of time found in Buddhism. Applewhite also utilized New Age concepts, but he differed from that movement by predicting that apocalyptic, rather than utopian, changes would soon occur on Earth. He contended that most humans had been brainwashed by Lucifer, but that his followers could break free of this control. He specifically cited sexual urges as the work of Lucifer. In addition, he stated that there were evil extraterrestrials, whom he referred to as [...] "Luciferians", who sought to thwart his mission. He argued that many prominent moral teachers and advocates of political correctness were actually Luciferians. This theme emerged in 1988, possibly in response to the lurid alien abduction stories that were proliferating at the time.|$|E
