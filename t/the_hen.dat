5|$|External parasites of the {{mistle thrush}} include <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> flea, the moorhen flea, the {{castor bean tick}} and the brightly {{coloured}} harvest mite. Internally, the thrush may be hosting tapeworms, nematodes, and Syngamus merulae a relative of the gapeworm. Blood parasites include Trypanosoma and Plasmodium species.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>hen</b> flea (Ceratophyllus gallinae) is {{the most}} common flea in their nests. The small, pale house-sparrow flea C. fringillae, is also {{occasionally}} found there and probably arises from the habit of its main host of taking over the nests of other species. This flea does not occur in the US, even on house sparrows. Lice include Menacanthus eurystemus, Brueelia nebulosa and Stumidoecus sturni. Other arthropod parasites include Ixodes ticks and mites such as Analgopsis passerinus, Boydaia stumi, Dermanyssus gallinae, Ornithonyssus bursa, O. sylviarum, Proctophyllodes species, Pteronyssoides truncatus and Trouessartia rosteri. <b>The</b> <b>hen</b> mite D. gallinae is itself preyed upon by the predatory mite Androlaelaps casalis. The presence of this control on numbers of the parasitic species may explain why birds are prepared to reuse old nests.|$|E
5|$|Looking outward, Dál Riata's {{neighbours}} {{in north}} Britain were the Picts and the Britons of <b>the</b> <b>Hen</b> Ogledd, the Brittonic-speaking parts {{of what is}} now Northern England and southern Lowland Scotland. The most powerful Brittonic kingdom in the area was Alt Clut, later known as Strathclyde and Cumbria.

5|$|Mallards are opportunistically {{targeted}} by brood parasites, occasionally having eggs laid in their nests by redheads, ruddy ducks, lesser scaup, gadwalls, northern shovellers, northern pintails, cinnamon teal, common goldeneyes, and other mallards. These eggs are generally accepted when they resemble the eggs {{of the host}} mallard, but <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> may attempt to eject them or even abandon the nest if parasitism occurs during egg laying.|$|E
5|$|The Ornithological Dictionary is George Montagu's best-known work, and the {{one that}} {{established}} his reputation as a pioneer of British ornithology. He compiled the book at his home Knowle House, near Kingsbridge in Devon. It was published soon after the first volume of Thomas Bewick's illustrated handbook, A History of British Birds, which appeared in 1797. It does not describe what is now called Montagu's harrier, which he separated from <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> harrier in 1803, after the publication of the book.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>hen</b> alone incubates {{the eggs}} for 22 to 24 {{days before they}} hatch. The precocial downy chicks are then led by the female to the nearest body of water, where they feed on dead insects on the water surface.

5|$|It interbreeds {{regularly}} and extensively with the mallard, {{to which it}} is closely related. The female lays six to fourteen oval eggs, which have smooth shells and come in varied shades of white and buff green. Hatching takes 30 days on average. Incubation usually takes 25 to 26 days, with both sexes sharing duties, although the male usually defends the territory until the female reaches the middle of her incubation period. It takes about six weeks to fledge. Once the eggs hatch, <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> leads the brood to rearing areas with abundant invertebrates and vegetation.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Aneirin {{manuscript}} is {{from the}} later 13th century, but Y Gododdin has been dated to anywhere between the 7th and the early 11th centuries. The text is partly written in Middle Welsh orthography and partly in Old Welsh. The early date would place its oral composition soon after the battle, presumably in <b>the</b> <b>Hen</b> Ogledd ("Old North"); as such {{it would have been}} written in the Cumbric dialect of Common Brittonic. Others consider it the work of a poet from Wales in the 9th, 10th or 11th century. Even a 9th-century date would make it one of the oldest surviving Welsh works of poetry.|$|E
5|$|The Gododdin, {{known in}} Roman times as the Votadini, held territories {{in what is}} now {{southeast}} Scotland and Northumberland, part of <b>the</b> <b>Hen</b> Ogledd (Old North). The poem tells how a force of 300 (or 363) picked warriors were assembled, some from as far afield as Pictland and Gwynedd. After a year of feasting at Din Eidyn, now Edinburgh, they attacked Catraeth, which is usually identified with Catterick, North Yorkshire. After several days of fighting against overwhelming odds, nearly all the warriors are killed. The poem is similar in ethos to heroic poetry, with the emphasis on the heroes fighting primarily for glory, but is not a narrative.|$|E

50|$|When small, {{the chicks}} are dark brown. The roosters weigh 2-3.25 kg and <b>the</b> <b>hens</b> from 1.5-2 kg. <b>The</b> <b>hens</b> are nonsitters, and produce 160 eggs per year of 55-60 g weight. A chicken starts to produce eggs when eight months old. Chicks hatch out brown.|$|R
40|$|A {{longer life}} for laying hens is desired from an ethical point of view. Not only because <b>the</b> <b>hens</b> {{can be used}} for a longer period but also less male chicks would have to be killed at the age of one day. In large flocks of laying hens {{moulting}} has to be induced to prevent social instability in the flock. In this study, a method was investigated, to moult laying hens without too much stress for <b>the</b> <b>hens.</b> <b>The</b> chosen method with daily access to a bad weather hen run had no detectable negative effect on the behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>hens.</b> <b>The</b> moulting succeeded in improving egg quality and plumage condition...|$|R
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Hen</b> and Chicken Islands, Pacific rats were {{eradicated}} on Whatupuke in 1993, Lady Alice Island in 1994, and Coppermine Island in 1997. Following this program, juveniles {{have once}} again been {{seen on the}} latter three islands. In contrast, rats persist on Hen Island of the same group, and no juvenile tuatara had been seen there as of 2001. In the Alderman Islands, Middle Chain Island holds no tuatara, but it is considered possible for rats to swim between Middle Chain and other islands that do hold tuatara, and the rats were eradicated in 1992 to prevent this. Another rodent eradication was carried out on the Rangitoto Islands east of D'Urville Island, {{to prepare for the}} release of 432 Cook Strait tuatara juveniles in 2004, which were being raised at Victoria University as of 2001.|$|E
5|$|Phasianidae {{consists}} of the pheasants and their allies. These are terrestrial species, variable in size but generally plump with broad relatively short wings. Many species are gamebirds or have been domesticated as a food source for humans. Turkeys have a distinctive fleshy wattle that hangs from {{the underside of the}} beak and a fleshy protuberance that hangs from the top of its beak called a snood. As with many galliform species, the female (<b>the</b> <b>hen)</b> is smaller and much less colorful than the male (the tom). With wingspans of , the turkeys are the largest birds in the open forests in which they live and are rarely mistaken for any other species. Grouse inhabit temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. In all of Maryland's species, males are polygamous and have elaborate courtship displays. These heavily built birds have legs feathered to the toes. Most species are year-round residents and do not migrate. Four species of Phasianidae have been recorded in Maryland.|$|E

5|$|The main {{language}} of Strathclyde {{and elsewhere in}} <b>the</b> <b>Hen</b> Ogledd in the opening years of the High Middle Ages was Cumbric, a variety of the British language akin to Old Welsh. Some time after 1018 and before 1054, the kingdom {{appears to have been}} conquered by the Scots, most probably during the reign of Máel Coluim mac Cináeda who died in 1034. At this time the territory of Strathclyde extended as far south as the River Derwent. In 1054, the English king Edward the Confessor dispatched Earl Siward of Northumbria against the Scots, then ruled by Mac Beth. By the 1070s, if not earlier in the reign of Máel Coluim mac Donnchada, it appears that the Scots again controlled Strathclyde, although William Rufus annexed the southern portion in 1092. The territory was granted by Alexander I to his brother David, later King David I, in 1107.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{agree that}} the place-name element eccles-, from the Brythonic word for church, represents evidence of the British church of the Roman and immediate post-Roman period. In Scotland {{most of these are}} located in the south of the country {{in the area of the}} British successor states that would be known as <b>the</b> <b>Hen</b> Ogledd, or the Old North. From the fifth and sixth centuries, inscribed stones indicate Christianity through their dedications and are spread across southern Scotland. The earliest is the so-called Latinus stone of Whithorn, dating to around 450. A slightly later stone at Kirkmadrine commemorates sacerdotes, which may be bishops. Among the key indicators of Christianisation are cemeteries containing long cists, which are generally east-west in orientation, like Christian graves. These cemeteries are suspected, or known to be Christian, because of their proximity to a church, or because they have Christian inscriptions. They are found from between the end of the Roman era in the early fifth century and the twelfth century. They are concentrated strongly in eastern Scotland south of the River Tay, in the modern East and Borders of Scotland. Writing in the sixth century, St. Patrick also mentioned Coroticus, who probably ruled from the fort at Dumbarton rock and who had already accepted Christianity. The poem Y Gododdin, set in the early sixth century and probably written in what is now Scotland, indicates that the warriors of Gododdin, probably a kingdom based the site of modern Edinburgh, were Christian, receiving communion and confessing their sins before battle.|$|E
