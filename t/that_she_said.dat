5|$|Back at FBI headquarters, Scully {{testifies to}} Skinner that she {{believes}} Mulder is mentally sound and fit for duty, noting that Pincus {{and several others}} mysteriously disappeared, {{that there was an}} intruder in Mulder's room, and that Backus did have some sort of chemical in his system. Afterward she tells Mulder <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> it was Folie à deux, and describes it as 'a madness shared by two'. But she does not specify who the two were.|$|E
5|$|During the happenings of the episode, a man playing Santa at a Christmas-themed ranch {{is shown}} videotaping the {{children}} at his ranch. Billie later tells Mulder that she saw a vision of her daughter in her room and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> the number 74. Mulder decides he cannot finish the case and wants {{to take time off}} because he's too close to make any sound judgment. On their way to the airport, Scully comes across the Santa park (situated off of California State Route 74) and decides to stop because of the reference to Santa Claus in the notes. Here they find the videotape setup and tapes dating {{all the way back to}} the '60s, including one of Amber Lynn LaPierre. The man who runs the park is promptly arrested, and Mulder finds graves of children all over his ranch.|$|E

5|$|Interior Minister Anne Holmlund, who {{had ordered}} the {{original}} investigation into the police officers' conduct in the Kauhajoki incident, said that legislation would be introduced to aid police officers in accessing information about the {{mental and physical health}} of applicants for firearms licenses. This included, potentially, the ability to gain detailed information about an applicant's health, the right to subpoena records from the Finnish Social Insurance Institution, and the right to request further information if the applicant had a history of using medication. In addition to this, Holmlund said that the referencing process for being granted a firearms license would be intensified: two referees would have to be personally interviewed before a license was granted. Holmlund also pointed to legislation of the EU as her starting point. Other reforms, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> would be introduced as late as spring 2009, included a national register of gun owners. Parliamentary debates occurred on whether to raise the age at which one could own a gun, or whether to put further checks in place, in September 2009.|$|E

Janine meets a man named Richard Monroe (Andrew Hall), who settles her bill. Impressed by his car, Janine leaves with him. Worried about her son Phil (Steve McFadden) because of his addiction to the drug crack cocaine, Peggy enlists the help of Minty Peterson (Cliff Parisi) and Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) to abduct him from the flat he is living in. They {{bring him back to}} The Queen Victoria, locking him in the living room upstairs, where the windows have been boarded up to stop him from escaping. Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner) reveals to Dot Branning (June Brown) that her deceased husband Bradley (Charlie Clements) is not the father of her baby Lily.|$|E

25|$|Dushku {{came to the}} {{attention}} of casting agents when she was 10. She was chosen in a five-month search for the lead role of Alice in the film That Night. In 1993, Dushku landed a role as Pearl alongside Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio in This Boy's Life, a role <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> opened a lot of doors. The following year, she played the teenage daughter of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis in True Lies.

25|$|On {{the evening}} of 17 July 2008, a woman was {{approached}} by Ghazni Province police officers {{in the city of}} Ghazni outside the Ghazni governor's compound. She was holding two small bags at her side while crouching on the ground. This aroused the officer's suspicion, raising concerns that she might be concealing a bomb under her burqa. Previously, a shopkeeper had noticed a woman in a burqa drawing a map, which is suspicious in Afghanistan where women are generally illiterate. There had also been a report that a Pakistani woman in a burqa with a boy were traveling in Afghanistan urging women to volunteer for suicide bombing. She was accompanied by a young boy <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> was her adopted son. She said her name was Saliha, that she was from Multan in Pakistan, and that the boy's name was Ali Hassan. Discovering that she did not speak either of Afghanistan's main languages, Pashtu or Dari, the officers regarded her as suspicious. She told the police she was looking for her husband, needed no help, and started to walk away. She was arrested and taken to the police station for questioning. She initially claimed the boy was her stepson, Ali Hassan. (The woman was not identified as Siddiqui until after hospitalized and fingerprinted. She subsequently admitted he was her biological son when DNA testing proved the boy to be Ahmed.|$|E

500|$|On 2 March 1882, Roderick Maclean, {{a disgruntled}} poet {{apparently}} offended by Victoria's refusal to accept {{one of his}} poems, shot at the Queen as her carriage left Windsor railway station. Two schoolboys from Eton College struck him with their umbrellas, until he was hustled away by a policeman. Victoria was outraged when he {{was found not guilty}} by reason of insanity, but was so pleased by the many expressions of loyalty after the attack <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> it was [...] "worth being shot at—to see how much one is loved".|$|E
500|$|When the Pam {{character}} discusses her impressive volleyball ability, {{she says}} she played volleyball in junior high, senior high, college and went to volleyball camps most summers. However, in the episode [...] "Job Fair", she said her high school gym brings back memories of her faking PMS {{to get out of}} playing basketball and volleyball. Writer Jen Celotta acknowledged this was a continuity error: [...] "Yeah, we screwed up. I didn't remember <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that, specifically about volleyball. And we really do try to be careful about those things." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Arguably, {{the single}} most {{important}} legislative responsibility that aldermen have is voting on the city budget each year," [...] Shiller said. She was the lone dissenting vote on Daley's 1996, 1997 and 1998 budgets. During hearings on Daley's 1996 budget, which included a $19.5 million property-tax increase, she submitted 123 questions on the budget in writing to department heads, but only 35 were answered. She objected to the tax increase in a period of several years of budget surpluses. She attended every hearing on Daley's 1997 budget armed with policy questions <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> went unanswered. She was often the only alderman present at budget hearings.|$|E

500|$|The episode also {{features}} several callback references to previous episodes. Oscar saying [...] "Whazzup!" [...] {{serves as a}} reference to a scene from [...] "Pilot" [...] between Michael, Dwight, and Jim. Jim's description in his final talking head of his job is a direct quote from his first talking head in [...] "Pilot". Dwight hires Devon back after Creed quits, a reference to [...] "Halloween", when Creed convinced Michael to fire Devon. Pam sits at reception one final time and answers the phone, saying [...] "Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam." [...] This is a reference to Pam's former role as office receptionist and a common phrase <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> during the early seasons. Pam's painting of the office building, introduced in [...] "Business School", plays a prominent role in the final scene.|$|E
500|$|A Fast-Track {{audition}} {{that was}} to be held at SM City Sta. Mesa was canceled, leading to complaints from hopefuls and their parents. [...] After hours of waiting, a representative of ABC arrived and relocated each of the 160 frustrated applicants to other scheduled screening. [...] Meanwhile, Filipinos living in Mindanao reacted negatively to what Philippine Idol judges said after a low Gold Pass turnout at the Davao Main Auditions, with Corrales (a Cebuana herself) saying that [...] "Davao {{is not the place to}} look for an Idol" [...] and [...] "all the good ones are in Cebu". [...] Corrales later clarified in the Wildcard Round <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> such a statement because of the low turnout in the Davao auditions and the even lower Gold Pass output. She added that [...] "Davao's best talents" [...] might have probably auditioned earlier in Manila.|$|E
500|$|Bonfire {{competed with}} Van Grunsven {{at his first}} Olympic Games (her second Games) in 1992 at the Barcelona Games. There, the pair took 4th individually, while helping the Dutch team to a silver medal. At the 1996 Summer Olympics, they {{repeated}} the team performance, while improving to take an individual silver medal. In 2000, at the Sydney Games, the pair won their first (and only) individual gold, while helping the Dutch team to a third silver medal. After the Sydney Games, Van Grunsven replaced Bonfire with Salinero as her Olympic horse. Bonfire and Van Grunsven also competed in two World Equestrian Games. The first, the 1994 The Hague Games, resulted in two medals for the pair – an individual gold and a team silver. At the second, the 1998 World Equestrian Games in Rome, the pair took home both the individual and team silver. However, Van Grunsven considered the judging at this Games so poor <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I thought I would quit dressage." ...|$|E

500|$|As part of {{the annual}} Guild Day {{procession}} of the inauguration of the new mayor of Norwich it was tradition for the head boy to deliver a short speech in Latin from the school porch [...] "commending justice and obedyence" [...] to the mayor and corporation. Afterwards the orator would attend the guild dinner, historically riding in the procession on a white horse, but in later years taken in the mayor's carriage. When Elizabeth I visited Norwich on a separate occasion in 1578 the master at the time, Stephen Limbert, {{is said to have}} delivered an oration, which [...] "so pleased Her Majesty <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> it had been the best she had heard, and gave him her hand to kiss, and afterwards sent back to enquire his name." [...] The encounter has been said to characterise the public image of Elizabeth I as a monarch who indulged her subjects with goodwill and has been used for the interpretation of the character of Theseus in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E
500|$|Anna Wintour {{attended}} the film's New York premiere, wearing Prada. Her friend Barbara Amiel reported <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> shortly afterward {{that the movie}} would go straight to DVD. But {{in an interview with}} Barbara Walters that aired the day the DVD was released, she called the film [...] "really entertaining" [...] and said she appreciated the [...] "decisive" [...] nature of Streep's portrayal. [...] "Anything that makes fashion entertaining and glamorous and interesting is wonderful for our industry. So I was 100 percent behind it." [...] Streep said Wintour was [...] "probably more upset by the book than the film". Anna Wintour’s popularity skyrocketed after her portrayal in The Devil Wears Prada. She was happy with the portrayal she got from Meryl Streep that did not place her in a position of complete villainy in which she felt was an unfair representation of her. [...] Meryl Streep said she did't base her character in the The Devil Wears Prada on Anna Wintour, instead saying she was inspired by men she had known previously: [...] "Unfortunately you don't have enough women in power, or at least I don't know them, to copy." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Ruth Norman began {{publishing}} Tesla Speaks, {{a series}} of messages <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> were given to her by the American inventor and engineer Nikola Tesla from his dwelling in outer space; she stated that he also relayed messages from scientists Albert Einstein and Louis Pasteur to her. Norman asserted that the Tesla Tower held secrets which were to be recovered by Unarius. The American journalist Alexander S. Heard argues that Tesla's rumored interests in death rays and free energy drew the group to him. In 1973, Norman recounted an experience in which she spiritually married the archangel Michiel at a lavishly decorated temple on another planet; the event {{was said to have}} culminated with her being crowned the Queen of Archangels, Uriel, by the Archangel Raphiel. She and Spiegel envisioned the events of the ceremony over several days, and she published their recollections later that year. Her students subsequently referred to her as Uriel, an acronym of [...] "universal, radiant, infinite, eternal light". She and Spiegel re-enacted the ceremony for her followers, and the group celebrated the anniversary of the event annually. After her spiritual marriage, Norman increased her channeling of historical figures, including Plato, Tesla, and John F. Kennedy.|$|E
