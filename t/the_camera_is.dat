5|$|Resident Evil – Code: Veronica {{features}} traditional survival horror gameplay {{found in}} most early Resident Evil games. This includes the series signature controls, interface, puzzles, as well as zombies and monsters to battle. Unlike previous games in the series which used pre-rendered backgrounds, Code: Veronica uses real-time 3D environments. Because of this, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> more dynamic than in previous games. The camera will follow, pan, and zoom as the player navigates their character through the environment, similar to Capcom's own Dino Crisis (1999). The story is told through cinematic CGI sequences and in-game cutscenes.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{clouds are}} very {{difficult}} to detect from aircraft as no onboard cockpit instruments exist to detect them. However, a new system called Airborne Volcanic Object Infrared Detector (AVOID) has recently been developed by Nicarnica Aviation, a daughter company of the Norwegian Institute for Air Research, which will allow pilots to detect ash plumes up to 100 km (62 mi) ahead and fly safely around them. The system uses two fast-sampling infrared cameras, mounted on a forward-facing surface, that are tuned to detect volcanic ash. This system can detect ash concentrations of <1 mg/m3 to > 50 mg/m3, giving pilots approximately 7–10 minutes warning. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> currently being tested by easyJet airline company.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{comes in}} the form of both avoidable random {{encounters}} and scripted fights where <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> fixed within the fighting area: enemies and bosses are primarily drawn from Japanese folklore and mythology. Battles are triggered only when enemies are near, with the player character otherwise keeping their weapons sheathed. In combat, characters attack and guard using a single-button prompt, while another button accesses items such as healing potions. Continuously attacking triggers combos. Different moves include sword slashes combined with directional buttons, which have different effects such as throwing an enemy into the air with an upward slash. Additional offensive items such as smoke bombs are acquired during the course of the game. At the end of each battle, experience points are awarded to the player character depending on how fast the battle was finished: leveling up increases a character's health, stats, and the amount of damage inflicted upon enemies.|$|E
30|$|As {{previously}} mentioned <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> identical in every respect. <b>The</b> left <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> operated {{as a master}} while <b>the</b> right <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> operated as a slave but this distinction is merely {{the result of the}} way the outputs from <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> treated by <b>the</b> video concentrator.|$|R
5000|$|While some {{disposables}} {{contain an}} actual cartridge as used for loading normal, reusable cameras, others {{just have the}} film wound internally on an open spool. <b>The</b> whole <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> handed in for processing. Some of <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> recycled, i.e. refilled with film and resold. <b>The</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> returned for [...] "processing" [...] {{in the same fashion}} as film cameras.|$|R
5000|$|In older analog {{security}} <b>camera</b> systems, <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> [...] "dumb" [...] devices only {{capable of}} producing a video signal continuously, and any video signal processing {{had to be done}} by the recording VMS. With modern megapixel network <b>cameras,</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> much more sophisticated.|$|R
5|$|Production on {{the game}} started at the {{beginning}} of 2001 with a team of only four programmers. Since Resident Evil was one of Capcom's first titles developed for the GameCube, the development team had to study the system's performance during the first stages of development. Initially, the team considered the possibility of creating the game's environments with computer graphic animation, but then realized that this approach would require too much hardware capacity and processing to achieve realistic graphics. As a result, the graphical style of the remake features 3D models over pre-rendered backgrounds like the Resident Evil games for the PlayStation. Despite this, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> more dynamic and can track the player at varying angles. The backgrounds also make use of particle effects and full motion video layers to simulate effects such as rushing water or swaying tree branches. Causing fear to the player was a high priority, and many of the game's backgrounds were designed to have a high contrast between dark and light so that enemies could appear unexpectedly.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> used as a loop antenna for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E
5|$|The {{dancing is}} {{restrained}} {{with a single}} prop: that of a solitary chair. At {{one point in the}} first segment of the video, she is filmed dancing but <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> almost still and the motions of the dance are confined within the small range of the camera. As the screens inside the viewing booths open and close, the camera slices the shots of Madonna each with its own angle and duration. The same imagery is exhibited by the little boy outside who tries to frame Madonna's playbill image into different angles. There are four other men in the booths who are made of wood with paintings of artist Tamara de Lempicka on them. Madonna at one point takes off her gloves like Rita Hayworth in Gilda and points towards one of the wooden paintings. It collapses and she blows on her finger.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> {{capable of}} {{interchangeable}} lenses.|$|R
50|$|A <b>camera</b> {{mounted to}} <b>the</b> {{shuttles}} external tank captured Atlantis ascent to orbit. This {{was the first}} time such footage was recorded. However, after solid rocket booster separation, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> fogged with <b>the</b> propellant, and <b>was</b> rendered unusable. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> moved downward after STS-112.|$|R
50|$|In {{a typical}} scene, objects close to <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>are</b> at <b>the</b> {{bottom of the}} image, and objects far from <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>are</b> at <b>the</b> top. This is less true if the image {{includes}} significant height as well as depth; a tall object near <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> can extend <b>the</b> height of the entire image.|$|R
5|$|The player {{controls}} the protagonist Leon S. Kennedy from a third-person perspective. The gameplay focuses on action and shootouts involving crowds of enemies in large open areas but still features some Horror elements. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> placed behind Leon and zooms {{in for an}} over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms, instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons, and headshots instantly kill most human enemies. Players can shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{photography}} {{has raised}} {{a number of}} concerns on its effect on society. In Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954), <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> presented as promoting voyeurism. 'Although <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> an observation station, the act of photographing is more than passive observing'.|$|E
25|$|The {{new game}} engine also {{supported}} real-time shadows and dynamic lighting, {{as well as}} being capable of blending six to seven different texture layers, depending on how close <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> to the action.|$|E
50|$|Canon {{announced}} <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> on 26 August 2008. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> {{released on}} 6 October 2008.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> {{available}} in one color: black (suffix K).|$|R
5000|$|Karl Freund is the {{inventor}} of <b>the</b> unchained <b>camera.</b> With its first appearance in Der letzte Mann, <b>the</b> unchained <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> a revolution in early film. For the first time, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> free of <b>the</b> tripod and could move around the set. Because {{it was no longer}} confined to one position, thousands of new shots were possible. Freund was known to wear <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> on his stomach and walk around while it was filming. He would also put <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> on a cart that moves along a track. Several other innovative ways of moving <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>were</b> introduced by Freund, including putting <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> on a crane.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> the image-forming device, and a {{photographic}} plate, photographic film or a silicon electronic image sensor is the capture medium. The respective recording medium {{can be the}} plate or film itself, or a digital magnetic or electronic memory.|$|E
25|$|Grandia's environments are {{depicted}} as three-dimensional maps, with characters represented by 2-D animated bitmap sprites. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> fully rotational and follows the party from an angled third-person perspective; {{it is often}} necessary to rotate the camera {{in order to see}} hidden items or passageways.|$|E
25|$|Early DSLRs {{lacked the}} ability to show the optical viewfinder's image on the LCD display – a feature known as live preview. Live preview is useful in {{situations}} where the camera's eye-level viewfinder cannot be used, such as underwater photography where <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> enclosed in a plastic waterproof case.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The cinematographer Gunnar Fischer (Operating <b>the</b> <b>camera)</b> <b>was</b> born in Ljungby.|$|R
5000|$|Objects at {{the same}} {{distance}} from <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>are</b> rendered equally sharp.|$|R
5000|$|Early blimped {{motion picture}} film <b>cameras</b> like <b>the</b> Mitchell <b>Camera</b> BNCR <b>were</b> not reflex finder cameras. Instead a {{viewfinder}} similar in concept to the Alan Gordon Mark Vb {{bolted to the}} side of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> employed by <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> operator to frame a shot when filming. In between takes, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> could <b>be</b> [...] "racked over" [...] to allow viewing of the actual taking lens.|$|R
25|$|Optical flowto determine, {{for each}} {{point in the}} image, how that point is moving {{relative}} to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding 3D point {{is moving in the}} scene and how <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> moving relative to the scene.|$|E
25|$|Tanaka {{felt that}} the rhythmically closer camera view {{technique}} would feel gimmicky just by itself, {{which is why he}} introduced the high school girl as a secondary character whose perspective <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> seeing. By placing a school girl into the video, Tanaka felt that this established that the video was shot in the present, emphasizing the oddness of the performance troupe Sakanaction play.|$|E
25|$|To me {{the ideal}} film— which I've never succeeded in making— {{would be as}} though the reel were behind one's eyes and you were {{projecting}} it yourself, seeing what you wish to see. This {{has a great deal}} in common with thought processes... That's why I think <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> an eye as well as a mind. Everything we do with the camera has physiological and mental significance.|$|E
30|$|No prior {{knowledge}} about the number and types of <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> available.|$|R
5000|$|Scenes {{would often}} {{continue}} after the characters believed <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> turned off.|$|R
5000|$|Objects at {{significantly}} different distances from <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>are</b> rendered with unequal sharpness.|$|R
25|$|The film {{ends with}} a montage of {{characters}} who stop {{in the middle of}} everyday chores to look up into the sky. Dixieland music is once again played as <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> put on the wing of an airplane. A large formation of B-52 bombers appears {{in front of the camera}} as they fly menacingly in over a large city. This bookends with the opening scene where a man wakes up and tells the audience that he had a nightmare about bombers coming.|$|E
25|$|At first, Android {{did not use}} a gesture-based lock screen, electing to just {{require the}} user to press the phone's Menu button. On Android 2.0, a new gesture-based lock screen was introduced, {{displaying}} two icons: one for unlocking the phone, and one for setting the volume mode, activated by dragging the relevant icon {{to the center of}} the screen on a curve (similarly to a rotary dial). On Android 2.1, the rotary dial was replaced by two tabs on either end of the screen. Android 3.0 introduced a new design: a ball with a padlock icon is dragged to the outside of a circular area. On 4.0, the option to unlock straight to <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> provided, while 4.1 adds the ability to unlock into a Google Search screen by dragging up. Android 4.2 makes additional changes to the lock screen, allowing users to add widgets to pages accessible on the lock screen by swiping from the left edge of the screen. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> accessed in a similar manner by swiping from the right edge of the screen. Android also allows devices to be locked using a password, passcode, a pattern on a grid of 9 circles, fingerprint sensing, or with facial recognition.|$|E
25|$|Norshteyn uses {{a special}} {{technique}} in his animation, involving multiple glass panels {{to give his}} animation a three-dimensional look. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> placed at the top looking down {{on a series of}} glass panels about a meter deep (one every 25–30cm). The individual glass panels can move horizontally as well as toward and away from the camera (to give the effect of a character moving closer or further away). Some scenes required a different approach, {{as can be seen in}} the image on the right.|$|E
50|$|Wolcott {{then made}} a camera that day with {{improvements}} on Daguerre's method. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> a wooden box 15 inches long, 8.5 inches high, and 8 inches wide. There was a 7-inch concave mirror {{in the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> constructed so that it had a large opening in front where the light rays of the person of the portrait passed through an aperture. The photo-sensitive 2 inch exposure plate was in a detachable frame in the center of this aperture opening, just inside the box. The operator of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> would set up the focusing of the portrait picture on an unsensitized plate first. Then once <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> focused with all of the mechanical items involved, then <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> operator would replace the focusing plate with the sensitized plate to take the picture.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> battery dependent, needing 2 LR44 or {{equivalent}} button cells to operate.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> {{reviewed}} by Digital Photography Review in February 2008 by Simon Joinson.|$|R
