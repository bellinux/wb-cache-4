50|$|An organic field-effect {{transistor}} device {{consists of three}} major components: the source, the drain and the gate. Generally, a {{field-effect transistor}} has two plates, source in contact with drain and the gate respectively, working as conducting channel. The electrons move from source to the drain, and the gate serves to control the electrons’ movement from source to drain. Different types of FETs are designed based on carrier properties. <b>Thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>transistor</b> (TFT), among them, is an easy fabricating one. In a <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>transistor,</b> the source and drain are made by directly depositing {{a thin layer of}} semiconductor followed by a thin film of insulator between semiconductor and the metal gate contact. Such a thin film is made by either thermal evaporation, or simply spins coating. In a TFT device, there is no carrier movement between the source and drain. After applying a positive charge, accumulation of electrons on the interface cause bending of the semiconductor and ultimately lowers the conduction band with regards to the Fermi-level of the semiconductor. Finally, a highly conductive channel is formed at the interface.|$|E

40|$|The implantable {{electronic}} systems have changed our life greatly and provided crucial support {{for people who}} previously could not live an independent life otherwise. However, current implantable {{electronic systems}} are based on technologies more than 50 years old and more medical problems require advanced implantable electronic systems with small form factors and multiple electrodes. This work explores and evaluates possible alternatives of implantable electronic systems. Parylene, a widely used MEMS/CMOS process compatible material, {{is the cornerstone of}} this work. Parylene has been an ISO 10933 and USP Class VI certiﬁed biocompatible material. Parylene serves as the substrate and protective coating of the implantable electronic systems developed in this work. <b>Thin</b> <b>ﬁlm</b> pentacene is studied in this work and <b>thin</b> <b>ﬁlm</b> pentacene <b>transistors</b> are developed. The <b>thin</b> <b>ﬁlm</b> pentacene <b>transistor</b> uses Parylene as the ﬂexible substrate, the gate insulator and the protective coating. Studies of parylene surface are carried out. And based on this study, pentacene hole mobility is improved using spin-cast smoothing layers and top-contact conﬁgurations. To evaluate the long term reliability and stability of the <b>thin</b> <b>ﬁlm</b> pentacene <b>transistors,</b> saline soaking tests are performed. The results are less than satisfactory. In addition, <b>thin</b> <b>ﬁlm</b> amorphous silicon is studied and <b>thin</b> <b>ﬁlm</b> amorphous silicon <b>transistors</b> are developed.

In order to allow for easier grip and improve the feel, the paddle shifters are made from magnesium alloy. The 8-inch <b>Thin</b> <b>Film</b> <b>Transistor</b> LCD circular dial embedded in the instrument panel is a direct descendent of the LFA design — it moves side-to-side as the driver moves through the various menus and settings, and the appearance will change depending on the selected drive mode. Also borrowed from the LFA is the Drive Mode Select control, which is placed {{to the side of}} the instrument panel.The LC is the first car to be developed on the new Lexus front-engine/rear-wheel drive platform, dubbed the Global Architecture - Luxury (GA-L) platform. The GA-L platform will serve as the starting point for all future rear-wheel drive Lexus vehicles of the future, and it’s meant to provide lower overall mass, improved front/rear weight distribution (54/46 front/rear balance for the gas model, 52/48 for the hybrid), and a low center of gravity. The platform design allowed engineers to push the wheels out further towards the corners of the vehicle, reducing the height of the hood while still accommodating the new multilink suspension. The engine position is also lowered 10 mm and pushed 50 mm closer to the center of the vehicle — this centers the weight of the engine and brings it closer to the drive, mitigating the load shifting from side to side. Run-flat tires are also used to avoid the need for a spare, and the vehicle battery has been relocated to the trunk to help with the overall balance.|$|E
