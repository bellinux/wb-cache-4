5000|$|Previous to the {{conclusion}} of season 10 of Red vs. Blue, Oum had pitched {{an idea for a}} series of his own; anxious to see the production deadline for Red vs. Blue met, Burns told Oum that if he could complete work on season 10 of Red vs. Blue on schedule, Oum would {{be given the opportunity to}} make his series. [...] At PAX East, that new series was announced as RWBY with Oum serving as lead animator and over-all creative director for the project. Like his previous work, RWBY featured highly involved and fantastical combat sequences between super-powered characters that garnered strong fan and critical praise. However, unlike all the series that Oum had worked on previously, the show had no thematic or stylistic links to an existing game franchise. Instead, the show featured characters and storylines of Oums own design, which he chose to base upon existing fairytales and folklore from both western and eastern cultures. In the lead-up to the release of RWBYs first season, Oum and Rooster Teeth generated buzz for the show through the release of four trailers, each of which featured one of the shows main four female protagonists.
