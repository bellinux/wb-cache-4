They would take turns watching the women and, as Marlon recalled, [...] "learned everything <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about ladies". During other residencies, the siblings would perform Joe Tex's [...] "Skinny Legs and All". Joseph Jackson would instruct a young Michael to make his way into the audience, crawl under tables, lift up ladies' skirts and peek at their panties as part of the performance. Though embarrassed by the task, Jackson feigned enjoyment as he knew the audience loved the routine.|$|E
500|$|In July 1840 he {{attempted}} to fuse his desire to make money with his politics by founding a magazine called the Revue Parisienne, funded by his friend Armand Dutacq. Having already worked in the publishing industry, Balzac believed he had learned all <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about the trade. [...] "hat gigantic machine known as journalism", he wrote, [...] "is {{as simple as a}} roasting spit turned by a poodle." [...] Balzac planned to publish his own fiction in the Revue Parisienne, in part to challenge the popularity of the roman-feuilleton serial format. Dutacq, however, stopped funding the project in September, after only three issues, and Balzac's final foray into the world of publishing came to an end.|$|E

2500|$|Thomas Nagel first {{characterized}} {{the problem of}} qualia for physicalistic monism in his article, [...] "What {{is it like to}} be a bat?". Nagel argued that even if we knew everything <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> from a third-person, scientific perspective about a bat's sonar system, we still wouldn't know {{what it is like to}} be a bat. However, others argue that qualia are consequent of the same neurological processes that engender the bat's mind, and will be fully understood as the science develops.|$|E

2500|$|In the 19th century, {{modifications}} to syllogism were incorporated {{to deal with}} disjunctive ("A or B") and conditional ("if A then B") statements. [...] Kant famously claimed, in Logic (1800), that logic was the one completed science, and that Aristotelian logic more or less included everything about logic <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> (This work is not necessarily representative of Kant's mature philosophy, which is often regarded as an innovation to logic itself.) Though there were alternative systems of logic such as Avicennian logic or Indian logic elsewhere, Kant's opinion stood unchallenged in the West until 1879 when Frege published his Begriffsschrift (Concept Script). [...] This introduced a calculus, a method of representing categorical statements (and statements that are not provided for in syllogism as well) {{by the use of}} quantifiers and variables.|$|E
