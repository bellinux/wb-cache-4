40|$|A {{proposed}} rule {{to implement}} Section 183 (e) of the Clean Air Act amendments (1990) will further restrict the {{volatile organic compound}} (VOC) content of rust-preventing coatings. <b>Thermal</b> <b>spray</b> polymers represent one option for protecting steel structures while complying with the new VOC restrictions. <b>Thermal</b> <b>spray</b> technology can apply polymer coatings to many different substrate materials at various thicknesses and under wide range of ambient conditions. Potential benefits of <b>thermal</b> <b>spray</b> polymers could be extended by blending post-consumer commingled polymers (PCCP) into coating feedstock materials; <b>thermal</b> <b>spray</b> polymers have the potential both to lower material costs and reduce {{the volume of the}} solid waste stream.

Also, cost savings resulting from blending 25 percent PCCP with 75 percent virgin polymer are insignificant compared to the total cost of a recoating job using other VOCcompliant systems.

40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>spraying</b> is a technology, {{which is}} used for coating of {{components}} and structures {{in order to achieve}} certain tribological characteristics, or for protection against corrosion, excessive temperature and wear. Within <b>thermal</b> <b>spray,</b> there are processes, which utilise combustion of liquid fuel to obtain high velocities flows providing, therefore, good adhesion of coating materials to substrates. These include High Velocity Oxygen Flame (HVOF) and High Velocity Air Flame (HVAF) process, of which the former one is widely used as it has been developed for at least two decades, while HVAF is less common. However, some studies indicate that HVAF has a number of advantages over HVOF, including the economic benefits. The <b>thermal</b> <b>spray</b> gun, based on the HVAF process, has been developed before, but the system was controlled manually.
