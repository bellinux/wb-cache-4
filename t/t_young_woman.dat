Each experimental group performed the same periodised training program that lasted for 8 weeks, with 2 – 4 sessions per week and 3 – 4 sets of 8 – 15 submaximal reps. A load cell (Isocontrol; ATEmicro, Madrid, Spain) was used to test the evolution of the Maximum Isometric Voluntary Contraction (MIVC) in 3 diff erent exercises: Vertical Rowing (VR), Squat (S) and Back Extension (BE). A mixed model MANOVA [group (CG, TBG, MFWG) x testing time (pre-test, post-test) ] was applied to determine the eff ect of the diff erent resistance training devices on strength. The only groups to improve their MIVC (p < 0. 005) were TBG and MFWG, respectively: VR 19. 87 % and 19. 76 %; S 14. 07 and 28. 88; BE 14. 41 % and 14. 00 %.

40|$|Study Objectives: To {{investigate}} how age influences {{the effects of}} 3 nights of sleep restriction in healthy women. Design: After a baseline night, sleep was restricted to 4 hours during 3 consecutive nights. One recovery night followed the sleep restriction. Setting: The sleep-restriction experiments were conducted under standardized conditions with continuous electroencephalographic ambulatory recordings. Before entering the study, the subjects underwent a polysomnographic recording for exclusion of sleep disorder and adaptation to the laboratory environment. Participants: Eleven <b>young</b> <b>women</b> (aged 20 - 30 years) and 10 older women (aged 55 - 65 years) {{were included in the}} study. Intervention: The subjects were admitted to the sleep laboratory for 5 consecutive nights and days. After 1 baseline night, 3 nights of sleep restriction to 4 hours were performed and were followed by 1 recovery night of 8 hours. Continuous ambulatory electroencephalographic recordings were performed, as well as the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (8 : 30 AM and 1 : 30 PM), the Stanford Sleepiness Scale, and the Psychomotor Vigilance <b>Test.</b> Results: <b>Young</b> <b>women</b> were more affected by sleep restriction than were the older women. This was evidenced by more sleep onsets during the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test sessions in the young subjects, who also rated themselves more sleepy than the older women.

40|$|Many {{scholars}} {{have called for}} an increased focus on positive aspects of sexual health and sexuality. Using a longitudinal design with two assessments, we investigated patterns of entitlement to sexual partner pleasure and self-efficacy to achieve sexual pleasure among 295 <b>young</b> men and <b>women</b> aged 17 – 25 years attending one Australian university. We also tested whether entitlement and efficacy differed by gender, and hypothesized that entitlement and efficacy would be higher in older participants and those with more sexual experience. A sense of entitlement to sexual partner pleasure increased significantly over {{the year of the}} study, whereas, on average, there was no change in self-efficacy over time. At Time 1 (<b>T</b> 1), <b>young</b> <b>women</b> reported more entitlement than young men. Age was positively associated with T 1 entitlement, and experience with a wider range of partnered sexual behaviors was concurrently associated with more entitlement and efficacy and was also associated with increased entitlement to partner pleasure and increased self-efficacy in achieving sexual pleasure at T 2 relative to T 1. A group with the least amount of sexual experience was particularly low in entitlement and efficacy when compared to groups with a history of coital experience. There was no evidence that any association differed between young men and <b>young</b> <b>women.</b> Limitations of the study include a sample of predominantly middle class, Caucasian students at one university and the possibility that students more interested in sex and relationships, and with more sexual experience, chose to participate...|$|R
40|$|Background. Chlamydia trachomatis (C. t.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common STD spread in Europe and in {{developed}} Countries. According to international studies, the highest prevalence is observed among asymptomatic, sexually active, <b>young</b> <b>women,</b> 15 - 24 aged. Objectives. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence and risk factors for genital infection with C. <b>t.</b> in <b>young</b> <b>women</b> under 25 aged attending to family planning clinics of Turin to active screening programs to be cost-effective in reducing the spread of C. t. infection. Study design. All the unrolled women between June 2008 -December 2010, were tested for C. t. infection, using Real time PCR, on a vaginal specimen. A kit and a socio-demographic, behavioral and clinical-gynaecological questionnaire were provided to the participating clinics. Results. The study included 1831 women, of whom 31 % 19 aged. The prevalence was 7. 3 % and was significantly associated being non Italian, having had more lifetime sexual partners and more than 1 partner in the previous six months. Conclusion. Our results are representative of general young female population of Turin. Data are comparable with those of other international studies. The high rate of infection provides information useful to plan health care interventions, like to extend the C. t. free test, not only to <b>young</b> <b>women</b> attending to STD centers but also to those one attending to family planning clinics and to promote prevention interventions to sensitize, not only youth population, on the spread of C. t. and other STD, but also family doctors and gynaecologists in order to reduce the diffusion of infections and relate complications...|$|R
40|$|Serological assays using {{dried blood}} spots from 5221 women {{in rural areas}} of eastern Zimbabwe {{were used to assess}} the {{epidemiology}} of Trichomonas vaginalis infection, and its association with HIV. Antibodies to T. vaginalis and to HIV were detected by enzyme immunoassays. Behavioural and demographic data were collected by confidential questionnaires. In total, 516 (9. 9 %) women were seropositive for T. vaginalis and seroprevalence increased with age among <b>younger</b> <b>women.</b> Divorced, widowed and single women {{were more likely to be}} seropositive. After controlling for age, seropositivity was significantly associated with being sexually active, having multiple sex partners, having a partner who had multiple sex partners, and having a new sex partner in the past year. Seropositivity was associated with a recent history of genital discharge. Overall, 208 (40. 3 %) T. vaginalis-positive samples were also positive for HIV, compared with 1106 (23. 5 %) T. vaginalis-negative samples (age and sex adjusted OR 2. 11, 95 % CI 1. 74 - 2. 55, P < 0. 001). There was increased risk for being HIV-positive amongst T. vaginalis-seropositive women regardless of residence, employment or education. In a logistic regression controlling for common risk factors, the association remained significant. <b>T.</b> vaginalis-seropositive <b>young</b> <b>women</b> with a history of genital discharge were much more likely to be HIV-positive than women who were T. vaginalis-seronegative and had no history of discharge (OR 6. 08, 95 % CI 2. 95 - 12. 53).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{identify}} {{the determinants of}} institutional delivery among <b>young</b> married <b>women</b> in Nepal. DESIGN: Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) data sets 2011 were analysed. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed using a subset of 1662 ever-married <b>young</b> <b>women</b> (aged 15 - 24 years). OUTCOME MEASURE: Place of delivery. RESULTS: The rate of institutional delivery among <b>young</b> married <b>women</b> was 46 %, which {{is higher than the}} national average (35 %) among all women of reproductive age. <b>Young</b> <b>women</b> who had more than four antenatal care (ANC) visits were {{three times more likely to}} deliver in a health institution compared with women who had no antenatal care visit (OR: 3. 05; 95 % CI: 2. 40 to 3. 87). The probability of delivering in an institution was 69 % higher among <b>young</b> urban <b>women</b> than among <b>young</b> <b>women</b> who lived in rural areas. <b>Young</b> <b>women</b> who had secondary or above secondary level education were 1. 63 times more likely to choose institutional delivery than <b>young</b> <b>women</b> who had no formal education (OR: 1. 626; 95 % CI: 1. 171 to 2. 258). Lower use of a health institution for delivery was also observed among poor <b>young</b> <b>women.</b> Results showed that wealthy <b>young</b> <b>women</b> were 2. 12 times more likely to deliver their child in an institution compared with poor <b>young</b> <b>women</b> (OR: 2. 107; 95 % CI: 1. 53 to 2. 898). Other factors such as the age of the <b>young</b> <b>woman,</b> religion, ethnicity, and ecological zone were also associated with institutional delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal health programs should be designed to encourage <b>young</b> <b>women</b> to receive adequate ANC (at least four visits). Moreover, health programs should target poor, less educated, rural, <b>young</b> <b>women</b> who live in mountain regions, are of Janajati ethnicity and have at least one child as such women are less likely to choose institutional delivery in Nepal...|$|R

This paper explores <b>young</b> <b>women</b> 2 ̆ 7 s decisions regarding their sexual relationships and pregnancy in a remote Australian Aboriginal community, called River Town.

40|$|The {{idea that}} men and women live in {{different}} worlds, and that women are shielded from forms of violence men experience, is a common assumption that does not hold true in inner-city neighborhoods. In Girls Fight, I examine how <b>young</b> <b>women</b> who live in distressed inner-city neighborhoods consider and respond to threats of violence in their everyday lives. This study, based on fieldwork conducted from 2001 – 2003 in Liberty, a large northeastern city, reveals the perceived instrumentality of violence in the lives of <b>young</b> Black <b>women</b> in the inner-city setting. Through participant observation, direct observation, and in-depth interviews with <b>young</b> <b>women</b> injured in violent incidents, I found that <b>young</b> Black <b>women</b> who live in distressed inner-city neighborhoods consider violence to be an important social resource. <b>Young</b> <b>women</b> who come of age in this setting learn, through instruction, observation, and experience, that they are primarily responsible for their own well-being. The appreciation of this lesson informs how <b>young</b> <b>women</b> consider and respond to threats of various kinds of violence, including violence in the neighborhood, interpersonal conflict, and gender-specific threats of violence. At times, girls fight. <b>Young</b> <b>women</b> in this setting fight to protect their own personal boundaries and to ensure the respect and security that comes with being able to do so. <b>Young</b> <b>women</b> also fight to gain status. A <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> 2 ̆ 7 s reputation as a “fighter” can facilitate her movement through potentially contentious school hallways and occasionally violent neighborhood blocks. Even those <b>young</b> <b>women</b> who do not achieve status as a consequence of their fighting ability realize the utility of physical violence. Thus, otherwise reluctant fighters will—after exhausting all possible strategies of avoidance—fight. As with any social resource, the utility of <b>young</b> <b>women</b> 2 ̆ 7 s violence has its limits. These limits are exposed in cases of gender-specific violence. Female caretakers in today 2 ̆ 7 s inner city are well aware of the various threats of violence confronting <b>young</b> Black <b>women.</b> Thus, <b>young</b> <b>women</b> are socialized for survival. This socialization process emphasizes <b>young</b> <b>women</b> 2 ̆ 7 s responsibility for their own well-being and the utility of being able to physically and publicly defend one 2 ̆ 7 s personal boundaries. ...|$|R

The notion that youth is a transient stage between childhood dependence and adult independence will be questioned at a theoretical level by looking at <b>young</b> <b>women</b> as <b>women</b> rather than <b>young</b> <b>women</b> as 2 ̆ 2 youths 2 ̆ 2. In doing so, the study is a theoretical challenge, to traditional youth studies notions about youth transition as a linear progression to adult independence. The research contests that for <b>young</b> <b>women,</b> adulthood has a different meaning than it does for young men based on the economic and social subordination of women. Methodologically, the thesis will be exploring a feminist approach in trying to comprehend and understand the experiences of <b>young</b> <b>women.</b> It will also explore how a feminist research process is an important part of the whole research project rather than a means to an end. This research endeavours to illustrate the multifaceted experiences of working class <b>young</b> <b>women</b> through presenting accounts of their experiences, views and perceptions as elicited through a series of dialogues with each <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> in the study. The areas of consideration are the relationships <b>young</b> <b>women</b> have within the economic and social realms of life. The study will convey the similarities and disparities between working class <b>young</b> <b>women</b> and locate these individual and common experiences in the wider structural framework of patriarchal capitalist relations...|$|R
