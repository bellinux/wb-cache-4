When Henson decided to engage Brillstein as his talent agent, Henson was not well known within the industry. Brillstein was an asset to Henson; his clients included Lorne Michaels and three Saturday Night Live cast members, Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, and John Belushi. Henson wanted Muppets incorporated into Saturday Night Live {{as a way to}} expunge the popular view his characters were only for young audiences. With help from Frank Oz, Henson generated The Land of Gorch characters for use on Saturday Night Live. His new characters were featured in the television program's first season. Henson designed <b>the</b> <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> of The Land of Gorch characters to be eccentric.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> several additional factors enabled the GWA studies. One was {{the advent of}} biobanks, which are repositories of human genetic material that greatly reduced the cost and difficulty of collecting sufficient numbers of biological specimens for study. Another was the International HapMap Project, which, from 2003 identified {{a majority of the}} common SNPs interrogated in a GWA study. The haploblock structure identified by HapMap project also allowed the focus on the subset of SNPs that would describe most of the variation. Also the development of the methods to genotype all these SNPs using genotyping arrays was an important prerequisite.|$|E
5|$|Variation and Evolution in Plants was {{the first}} book to provide a wide-ranging {{explanation}} of how evolutionary mechanisms operated in plants at the genetic level. It brought concepts related to plant evolution into line with animal evolution as it emerged from Dobzhansky's 1937 Genetics and the Origin of Species and provided <b>the</b> <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> to organize a disparate set of disciplines into a new field: plant evolutionary biology. In the book Stebbins argued that evolution needed to be studied as a dynamic problem and that evolution must be considered on three levels: first, that of individual variation within an interbreeding population; second, that of the distribution and frequency of this variation; and third, that of the separation and divergence of populations {{as the result of}} the building up of isolating mechanisms leading to the formation of species. He used the work of biosystematists Clausen, Keck, Hiesey, and Turesson to show that it was possible to distinguish between genotypic and phenotypic variationthat is, genetically identical plants could have different phenotypes in different environments. One of the book's most original chapters used the cytogenetics work of C. D. Darlington to show that genetic systems like hybridization and polyploidy were also subject to selection.|$|E

25|$|A {{complete}} homomorphism is {{one that}} preserves all sups that exist, not just the finite sups, and likewise for infs. The category CABA of all CABAs and their complete homomorphisms is dual to the category of sets and their functions, meaning that it {{is equivalent to the}} opposite of that category (the category resulting from reversing all morphisms). Things are not so simple for the category Bool of Boolean algebras and their homomorphisms, which Marshall Stone showed in effect (though he lacked both the language and <b>the</b> <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> to make the duality explicit) to be dual to the category of totally disconnected compact Hausdorff spaces, subsequently called Stone spaces.|$|E

500|$|His most {{important}} publication was Variation and Evolution in Plants, which combined genetics and Darwin's theory {{of natural selection}} to describe plant speciation.

[...] He also researched and wrote widely on the role of hybridization and polyploidy in speciation and plant evolution; his work in this area has had a lasting influence on research in the field.|$|E
500|$|Both {{practicing}} archaeoastronomers {{and observers}} of the discipline approach it from different perspectives. George Gummerman and Miranda Warburton view archaeoastronomy {{as part of an}} archaeology informed by cultural anthropology and aimed at understanding a [...] "group's conception of themselves in relation to the heavens', in a word, its cosmology. [...] Todd Bostwick argued that [...] "archaeoastronomy is anthropology – the study of human behavior in the past and present." [...] Paul Bahn has described archaeoastronomy as an area of cognitive archaeology. Other researchers relate archaeoastronomy to the history of science, either as it relates to a culture's observations of nature and <b>the</b> <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> they devised to impose an order on those observations or {{as it relates to the}} political motives which drove particular historical actors to deploy certain astronomical concepts or techniques. [...] Art historian Richard Poss took a more flexible approach, maintaining that the astronomical rock art of the North American Southwest should be read employing [...] "the hermeneutic traditions of western art history and art criticism" [...] Astronomers, however, raise different questions, seeking to provide their students with identifiable precursors of their discipline, and are especially concerned with the important question of how to confirm that specific sites are, indeed, intentionally astronomical.|$|E

2500|$|Colon's responsa {{are among}} the classic {{productions}} in this field of rabbinic literature and exercised tremendous influence on the subsequent development of Jewish Law or Halakhah. His decisions had massive influence upon all subsequent legal development. His influence is particularly notable in the Ashkenazic orbit, as reflected in Moses Isserles' glosses on the Shulhan Arukh. Colon's responsa were the central pillar of later Italian halakhah, and there is scarcely an Italian rabbi of the 16th, 17th and 18th century who does not quote him. These responsa are distinguished by his encyclopedic knowledge and methodical analysis of sources. He attempts to identify the basic principles underlying his sources and to elucidate <b>the</b> <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> within which he renders his rulings. His legal method also resembles the mode of analysis known as pilpul. [...] Established custom (or minhag) played a unique place in his thinking and he defines its authority. In this context, he served as the defender of a uniquely French school of Ashkenazic Law and Lore. The Mishneh Torah of Maimonides enjoys a preeminent place in his writings. His extensive comments thereupon, scattered throughout his responsa and lecture notes, helped to set the agenda for later scholars. [...] Colon's responsa are marked by tremendous deference to authorities of the past. Hesitating to decide between them, he resorted to methods of legal determination which removed or minimized this necessity (e.g. Halakha k’Bathra’i).|$|E
2500|$|Lack of {{adequate}} legislation which criminalizes domestic violence, or, alternatively legislation which prohibits consensual behaviors, may hinder the progress {{in regard to}} reducing the incidence of DV. Amnesty International’s Secretary General has stated that: [...] "It is unbelievable that {{in the twenty-first century}} some countries are condoning child marriage and marital rape while others are outlawing abortion, sex outside marriage and same-sex sexual activity – even punishable by death." [...] According to WHO, [...] "one of the most common forms of violence against women is that performed by a husband or male partner." [...] The WHO notes that such violence is often ignored because often [...] "legal systems and cultural norms do not treat as a crime, but rather as a 'private' family matter, or a normal part of life." [...] The criminalization of adultery has been cited as inciting violence against women, as these prohibitions are often meant, in law or in practice, to control women's and not men's behavior; and are used to rationalize acts of violence against women. According to High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay: [...] "Some have argued, and continue to argue, that family violence is placed outside <b>the</b> <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> of international human rights. However, under international laws and standards, there is a clear State responsibility to uphold women’s rights and ensure freedom from discrimination, which includes the responsibility to prevent, protect and provide redress – regardless of sex, and regardless of a person’s status in the family." ...|$|E
