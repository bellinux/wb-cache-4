The clip was official released {{few hours after}} she posted a 2000-word thank you message to fans on her official website on August 28, 2013. A part of the letter reads,I may get quiet at times, but when I do have something to say, I mean every word. I decided to share my thoughts with you at length and tell you openly how I feel. Thank you for filling my soul with melody and song … lyrics and love … and giving me a safe place I feel comforted in being brave enough to always bare my soul and come from an honest and genuine place. Be fearless {{enough to be a}} conversation piece … Speak your own truth… As always, thank you for accepting me for who I am. Being human – flaws and all. The music video for [...] "Let There Be Love" [...] was filmed in a DIY style. In the music video, Aguilera is seen in her one-piece swimsuit with the world [...] "love" [...] written all over it. It also featured guest appearances from Nicole Richie, Christina Milian, Chris Mann, Aguilera's son, Max Bratman, and her current boyfriend Matthew Rutler. The video begins with Aguilera' message, [...] "Hey everybody Chrisitina here just <b>thanking</b> <b>you</b> guys so much for filling my life and my heart with so much love continued throughout the years... Standing by me, I appreciate all your support, this one is just for you". Everybody is seen joking around with another friend as they make the [...] "L" [...] sign for [...] "love" [...] with their hands, as well as holding up signs with positive messages such as [...] "Don't judge", [...] "Equality", [...] "Racism sucks", [...] "Accept", and [...] "Amo a mi hijo gay" [...] ("I love my gay son"), while Aguilera's son Bratman [...] "excitedly" [...] "shows off his dancing chops". At the end, Aguilera blows a kiss to the camera.|$|E
