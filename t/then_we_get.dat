[...] The song [...] "Spit" [...] {{was inspired by the}} attitude of local bands towards Kittie. According to Morgan Lander, Spit is [...] "a dark album, but it's about every day life which isn't always peachy". According to Talena Atfield, the album's songs are about [...] "life experiences, basically. Oppression, people mistreating us, people putting you down because you're different, giving you a hard time because of who you are",which she said she experienced or saw in school. Spit was controversial because of its song titles, which made many people think that the album's songs are about sex. In an interview with NY Rock, Atfield said that none of the album's songs are about sex.|$|E

2500|$|More abstractly, the {{integral}} {{can be written}} as the cap product of the homology class of Z and the cohomology class represented by α. [...] By Poincaré duality, the homology class of Z is dual to a cohomology class which we will call , and the cap product can be computed by taking the cup product of [...] and α and capping with the fundamental class of X. [...] Because [...] is a cohomology class, it has a Hodge decomposition. [...] By the computation we did above, if we cup this class with any class of type (p, q) ≠ (k, k), <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> zero. [...] Because H2n(X, C) = Hn, n(X), we conclude that [...] must lie in Hn-k, n-k(X, C). [...] Loosely speaking, the Hodge conjecture asks: ...|$|E
2500|$|Lagrange did {{not prove}} Lagrange's theorem in its general form. He stated, {{in his article}} Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations, that if a {{polynomial}} in n variables has its variables permuted in all n! ways, the number of different polynomials that are obtained is always a factor of n!. [...] (For example, if the variables x, y, and z are permuted in all 6 possible ways in the polynomial x + y - z <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> a total of 3 different polynomials: x + y [...] z, x + z - y, and y + z [...] x. [...] Note that 3 is a factor of 6.) The number of such polynomials is the index in the symmetric group Sn of the subgroup H of permutations that preserve the polynomial. [...] (For the example of x + y [...] z, the subgroup H in S3 contains the identity and the transposition (xy).) So the size of H divides n!. [...] With the later development of abstract groups, this result of Lagrange on polynomials was recognized to extend to the general theorem about finite groups which now bears his name.|$|E

Under a new regulation, he has yielded the church of our watering-place to another clergyman. Upon the whole we get on in church well.
