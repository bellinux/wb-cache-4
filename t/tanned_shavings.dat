40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on an area of {{secondary}} processing of leather waste materials, which belongs together with a problem of waste formation and its disposal among the actual global issues. The emphasis is given to chrome-tanned waste which can represent {{a threat to the}} environment and human health because of the content of hexavalent chromium. This agent is classified as a carcinogen and its repeated exposure to human organism have hazardous impact. Secondary waste processing is a feasible solution against adverse effects resulting from waste materials. Economic and environment-friendly requirements are cardinal aspects of these ways of waste processing. The authors introduce the complex process of collagen protein hydrolysis gained from tannery wastes for the purpose of production inducers of resistance for agricultural plants. Along the treatment the chromium <b>tanned</b> <b>shavings</b> are three times hydrolyzed under different conditions. The intermediate products of the process find further applications. The process can be rank among closed-loop processes by its nature. Mathematical model for the third step of the whole process, the acid hydrolysis of enzymatic hydrolyzate based on balance equations for hydrolysis is presented...|$|E
50|$|Composition leather is {{made from}} {{recycled}} leather off-cuts, trimmings and shavings that would normally be sent by the leather industry to landfill. The type of leather specifically used {{in the manufacture of}} composition leather is called ‘wet blue’. This raw material, which is duck-egg blue in colour (hence the name), comes straight from <b>tanning.</b> The <b>shavings</b> are bonded to a fabric layer commonly using a process such a hydro-entanglement to force the leather dust into the fabric layer. The product is then finished, typically with a polyurethane based system to give a resemblance of leather. The amount of leather shavings within the final product typically constitute less than 50% of the product.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{characterization}} of the properties of wood fibres leather shavings composite board by using the near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and multivariate data analysis. In this study fibreboards were manufactured with different leather amounts by using spruce fibres, as well as vegetable and mineral <b>tanned</b> leather <b>shavings</b> (wet white and wet blue). The NIR spectroscopy was used to analyse the raw materials {{as well as the}} wood leather fibreboards. Moreover, the physical and mechanical features of the wood leather composite fibreboards were determined to characterize their properties for the further data analysis. The NIR spectra were analysed by univariate and multivariate methods using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) method. These results demonstrate the potential of FT-NIR spectroscopy to estimate the physical and mechanical properties (e. g., bending strength). This phenomenon provides a possibility for quality assurance systems by using the NIRS...|$|R
