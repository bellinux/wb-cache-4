25|$|Declines in the {{abundance}} of wild salmon due to over fishing placed greater pressure on hatcheries to increase production and restore the wild salmon stock to supply fisheries. The problem is that hatcheries can never truly replicate the environment of wild salmon, an issue which often results in physiological and behavioral differences between wild salmon and those reared in hatcheries. These differences are often the product of genetic changes associated with inbreeding, artificial selection, and natural selection as well as different environmental pressures acting on hatchery fish than wild populations. Due to the size selective nature of fishing favoring larger fish, a reduction in average size of the adult salmon has been observed over time. The smaller salmon make {{a greater proportion of}} the remaining individuals continuing the population, and problems arise when these hatchery-reared fish are introduced into the wild populations. Unlike wild salmon, larger salmon are selected for in hatcheries and are typically much larger than wild salmon. The result is that hatchery-produced salmon tend to out-compete wild salmon for space, food, and other resources. Some salmon species in hatcheries exhibit predatory behavior toward wild salmon because they grow to be much larger. Regardless of whether predation is observed, natural social interactions are disturbed by the release of large numbers of hatchery-reared salmon where wild populations are low because salmon in hatcheries naturally have a higher propensity towards aggressive behavior. Overall, natural salmon populations are put at risk when hatchery-reared salmon populations are introduced due to competition for resources, predation by larger individuals, and negative social interactions <b>that</b> <b>upset</b> the natural order observed in wild salmon populations. As a result, wild salmon populations are steadily dropping as the pressure to continue breeding salmon in hatcheries increases. Conservation efforts that work to place limitations on hatcheries to increase the wild salmon populations are hindered by financial pressures because hatcheries effectively support many states economically by accounting for over 70% of the salmon harvested for recreational and commercial purposes.|$|E

500|$|King is {{credited}} {{as one of}} the first bowlers to utilise swing bowling deliberately.

He described it as an in-swinger which, if properly bowled, would change direction sharply in the last 10 or [...] of flight. King used this ball only sparingly and only against good batsmen.

[...] Lardner said: [...] "If anyone tells you the East plays the best brand of football, Maulbetsch shot that theory full of holes." [...] According to Runyon, the Wolverines used [...] "the mighty Maulbetsch as their battering ram", and he [...] "gained enough ground against Harvard to bury a German army corps." [...] Football writer Frank G. Menke said: [...] "No westerner ever created half the stir in the east as did this Michigander [...] [...] [...] His peculiar, baffling style of attack, backed by phenomenal strength almost always earned for him gains of 5 to 20yards every time he was called upon to carry the ball." [...] Another writer noted Maulbetsch's skill as a [...] "line breaker" [...] as he [...] "carried the ball repeatedly through the Harvard line and into the secondary defense with bullet-like rushes <b>that</b> <b>upset</b> tackler after tackler."

500|$|Pfeiffer's {{performance}} {{continued to}} draw rave reviews from film critics, who hailed {{it as one}} of the decade's most powerful and sexiest. Film critic Roger Ebert predicted that The Fabulous Baker Boys would become [...] "one of the movies they will use as a document... when they begin to trace the steps by which Pfeiffer became a great star", concluding, [...] "This is the movie of her flowering - not just as a beautiful woman, but as an actress with the ability to make you care about her, to make you feel what she feels." [...] Ebert also identified Pfeiffer as a successor to classic Hollywood actresses Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe. Pfeiffer won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, her first win and second nomination after having been nominated the previous year for her performance as in Married to the Mob (1988). Some critics questioned why she had not been nominated in the award's Comedy or Musical category instead considering her several musical performances given throughout The Fabulous Baker Boys. Pfeiffer was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, her second Academy Award nomination. According to film critic Emanuel Levy, Pfeiffer and fellow nominee Jessica Tandy were considered to be the category's top two contenders due to the lackluster performances delivered by other nominees that year; the competition between Pfeiffer and Tandy was dubbed [...] "Old Hollywood Vs. Young Hollywood" [...] by the media {{as a result of the}} age difference between Pfeiffer (31) and Tandy (80) at the time. Despite being largely favored to win, Pfeiffer ultimately lost the award to Tandy, who won for her performance in Driving Miss Daisy (1989), a result <b>that</b> <b>upset</b> both surprised critics and the general public. Critics believe Tandy won because Academy Award voters felt sentimental towards her age, aided by the fact that her film had been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture while The Fabulous Baker Boys was not. Katey Rich of Vanity Fair insists that the award rightfully belonged to Pfeiffer, ranking the spectacle among [...] "10 Times the Golden Globes Got It Right and the Oscars Didn't". Pfeiffer became one of only seven actresses to win Best Actress awards from all four major United States film critics associations – the New York Film Critics Circle, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, The National Board of Review and the National Society of Film Critics – for a single performance, as well as the only one of these seven actresses who did not go on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress for that same performance.
