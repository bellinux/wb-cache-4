5|$|Echolocating bats {{follow an}} infinity-point path when hunting insects in the dark. This {{is not for}} {{camouflage}} but for {{the efficiency of the}} resulting path, so the strategy is generally called constant absolute target direction (CATD); it is equivalent to CBDR but allowing for the <b>target</b> <b>to</b> manoeuvre erratically.|$|E
5|$|A {{problem with}} early bombsights {{was that they}} could only correct {{for the effects of}} the wind in a simple way and {{required}} the bomber to fly directly up- or down-wind from the <b>target,</b> <b>to</b> minimise the complexity of the required calculations. This made it difficult to attack moving targets and allowed anti-aircraft artillery to sight their weapons along the wind line.|$|E
5|$|At around 07:00, {{the deer}} on the {{expansive}} lawns of the French colonial-era palace were frightened off as Quốc and Cử—flying American-built A-1 Skyraiders (A1H/AD-6 variant) single-seater ground attack planes—flew low over their <b>target</b> <b>to</b> inspect the ruling family's residence. On their second run, they dropped bombs and napalm before firing rockets and strafing the presidential compound with machine-gun fire. The two continued their runs for 30 minutes before units {{loyal to the}} president arrived and launched a counter-attack.|$|E

5|$|Holmes was a {{stand-up}} style goaltender; {{later on in}} his career, Holmes wore a cap when in goal to protect his head from objects thrown by spectators, as it presented a tempting <b>target</b> <b>to</b> them. Holmes coached minor-league teams after his retirement, notably the Toronto Millionaires of the Canadian Professional Hockey League (CPHL) and the Cleveland Indians of the International Hockey League (IHL). Holmes died on June 27, 1941, near Fort Lauderdale, Florida and was inducted posthumously into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1972.|$|E

25|$|This {{classification}} {{refers to}} the position of the N- and C-terminal domains. Types I, II, and III are single-pass molecules, while type IV are multiple-pass molecules. Type I transmembrane proteins are anchored to the lipid membrane with a stop-transfer anchor sequence and have their N-terminal domains <b>targeted</b> <b>to</b> the ER lumen during synthesis (and the extracellular space, if mature forms are located on plasmalemma). Type II and III are anchored with a signal-anchor sequence, with type II being <b>targeted</b> <b>to</b> the ER lumen with its C-terminal domain, while type III have their N-terminal domains <b>targeted</b> <b>to</b> the ER lumen. Type IV is subdivided into IV-A, with their N-terminal domains <b>targeted</b> <b>to</b> the cytosol and IV-B, with an N-terminal domain <b>targeted</b> <b>to</b> the lumen. The implications for the division in the four types are especially manifest at the time of translocation and ER-bound translation, when the protein has to be passed through the ER membrane in a direction dependent on the type.|$|R

40|$|Protein <b>targeting</b> <b>to</b> {{specified}} cellular compartments {{is essential}} to maintain cell function and homeostasis. In eukaryotic cells, two major pathways rely on N-terminal signal peptides <b>to</b> <b>target</b> proteins <b>to</b> either the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or mitochondria. In this study, we show that the ER signal peptides of the prion protein-like protein shadoo, the neuropeptide hormone somatostatin and the amyloid precursor protein have the property <b>to</b> mediate alternative <b>targeting</b> <b>to</b> mitochondria. Remarkably, the targeting direction of these signal peptides is determined by structural elements within the nascent chain. Each of the identified signal peptides promotes efficient ER import of nascent chains containing alpha-helical domains, but <b>targets</b> unstructured polypeptides <b>to</b> mitochondria. Moreover, we observed that mitochondrial targeting by the ER signal peptides correlates inversely with ER import efficiency. When ER import is compromised, <b>targeting</b> <b>to</b> mitochondria is enhanced, whereas improving ER import efficiency decreases mitochondrial targeting. In conclusion, our study reveals a novel mechanism of dual <b>targeting</b> <b>to</b> either the ER or mitochondria that is mediated by structural features within the nascent chain...|$|R

5|$|While small interfering RNAs (siRNA; 20-25nt) {{are often}} {{produced}} by breakdown of viral RNA, {{there are also}} endogenous sources of siRNAs. siRNAs act through RNA interference in a fashion similar to miRNAs. Some miRNAs and siRNAs can cause genes they <b>target</b> <b>to</b> be methylated, thereby decreasing or increasing transcription of those genes. Animals have Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNA; 29-30nt) that are active in germline cells and {{are thought to be}} a defense against transposons and play a role in gametogenesis.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler was {{concerned}} about a Balkan invasion, as the area had {{been the source of}} raw materials for the German war industry, including copper, bauxite, chrome and oil. The Allies knew of Hitler's fears, and they launched Operation Barclay, a deception operation to play upon his concerns and to mislead the Germans into thinking the Balkans were the objective, thereby keeping Sicily less defended than it could have been. In doing so, the deception operation reinforced German strategic thinking about the likely British <b>target.</b> <b>To</b> suggest the eastern Mediterranean was the target, the Allies set up a headquarters in Cairo, Egypt, for a fictional formation, the Twelfth Army, consisting of twelve divisions. Military manoeuvres were conducted in Syria, with numbers inflated by dummy tanks and armoured vehicles to deceive observers. Greek interpreters were recruited and the Allies stockpiled Greek maps and currency. Falsified communications about troop movements were generated from the Twelfth Army headquarters, while the Allied command post in Tunis – which was to be the headquarters of the Sicily invasion – reduced radio traffic by using land-lines wherever possible.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the invading army's entry into Laconia, Sparta was only lightly defended. The {{majority}} of the Spartan army had accompanied Areus on campaign in Crete, where the Lacedaimonians were supporting the polis of Gortyn. As such, Sparta must have seemed like an easy <b>target</b> <b>to</b> Pyrrhus. Arriving outside Sparta in the evening, Cleonymus advised Pyrrhus to attack immediately {{to take advantage of the}} dearth of defenders. Pyrrhus decided against launching an immediate offensive as he feared the destruction that would be wrought by his Gallic soldiers if they were to enter the city at night. Anticipating no resistance, Pyrrhus order his army to make camp and prepared to enter Sparta in the morning.|$|E

B3 was transferred to Leith during mid-1916 where she was fitted with an experimental hull-mounted directional hydrophone system and later sent to Rosyth in 1917 where she was used as either a <b>target</b> <b>to</b> train anti-submarine forces or experimental work {{for the rest of the}} war.

5|$|Early in the Savage's career, squadrons would {{typically}} deploy a detachment to Naval Air Station Port Lyautey, Morocco, {{for service}} with the Sixth Fleet and fly the bombers aboard aircraft carriers {{that were already}} deployed to the Mediterranean as needed. The plan was that the Savages would then be loaded with atomic bombs already aboard the carriers and launched once the carriers were in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The tactic to deliver the bombs was to fly at low level through Bulgaria and Romania before climbing at maximum power to the proper altitude to release the bomb. The aircraft would then perform a wingover maneuver and dive to low altitude, keeping {{the tail of the}} aircraft aimed at the <b>target</b> <b>to</b> avoid serious damage from the shock wave of the explosion.|$|E

5|$|GoldenEye 007 closely {{follows the}} plot of the movie, though with some minor alterations. The game starts in Arkhangelsk in the Soviet Union in 1986, where MI6 has {{uncovered}} a secret chemical weapons facility at the Byelomorye Dam. James Bond and fellow 00-agent Alec Trevelyan are sent to infiltrate the facility and plant explosive charges. During the mission, Trevelyan is apparently killed by Colonel Arkady Ourumov, but Bond escapes by commandeering an aeroplane. Five years later in 1991, Bond is sent to investigate a satellite control station in Severnaya, Russia, where programmers Natalya Simonova and Boris Grishenko work. Two years after the Severnaya mission, in 1993, Bond investigates an unscheduled test firing of a missile in Kyrgyzstan, believed to be a cover for the launch of a satellite known as GoldenEye. This space-based weapon works by firing a concentrated electromagnetic pulse at any Earth <b>target</b> <b>to</b> disable any electrical circuit within range. As Bond leaves the silo, he is ambushed by Ourumov and a squad of Russian troops. Ourumov manages to escape during the encounter.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} {{linked with the}} manager's {{position}} at Bradford City on numerous previous occasions, and after Colin Todd was sacked on 12 February 2007, City chairman Julian Rhodes made McCall his number one <b>target</b> <b>to</b> take over in the summer. Club captain David Wetherall temporarily took over and was later announced as caretaker manager {{for the rest of}} the 2006–07 season. On 22 May 2007, it was announced McCall would become manager of the club where he started his career, and on 1 June 2007 he assumed the position. In less than seven years since McCall's first two-game reign, serious financial problems had driven the club to the verge of closure, and although they survived the threat of oblivion, they were unable to avoid a terrible on-the-pitch decline, which continued after the financial nightmare had been relieved. On McCall's return to Valley Parade, the Bantams had just been relegated to League Two—meaning that they would be playing in the bottom division for the first time in 25 years. McCall set himself a target of earning promotion back to League One in his first season.|$|E
