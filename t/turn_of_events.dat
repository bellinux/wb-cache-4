5|$|The {{goodwill}} {{generated by}} this surprising <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> defused the situation, {{but to many}} observers the scene on the balcony was mere theatricality without long-term resonance. However pleased {{it may have been}} by the royal displays, the crowd insisted that the king come back with them to Paris.|$|E
5|$|This <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> proved highly unpopular {{with the}} local Greek population, and their representatives under Georgios Christakis-Zografos formed the Panepirotic Assembly in Gjirokastër in protest. The Assembly, short of {{incorporation}} with Greece, demanded either local autonomy or an international occupation by forces of the Great Powers for the districts of Gjirokastër, Sarandë, and Korçë.|$|E
50|$|John Joseph Keane (November 3, 1911 — January 6, 1967) was an American {{manager in}} Major League Baseball. Keane participated in one <b>of</b> the strangest <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> in {{baseball}} history in , his final season {{at the helm of}} the St. Louis Cardinals.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the {{prospects}} for the store have remained bleak due to several <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>events,</b> and Morris considers desperate measures. When he is hospitalized after inhaling gas from a radiator he failed to light (claiming afterwards {{that this was not}} deliberate), Frank comes back to run the store over Idas protests.|$|R
40|$|Over all, {{the set of}} {{chapters}} {{contained in}} this volume offers interesting perspectives which have been stimulated by the recent <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> in the foreign exchange market. They provide a useful reference for anyone interested {{in the development of}} exchange rate regimes, and represent considerable reflection and hard thinking by economists half a century after Bretton Woods...|$|R
5|$|With their {{change of}} {{fortunes}} after McElroy's 1958 decision, Army General James M. Gavin publicly stated that Zeus would soon replace strategic bombers as the nation's main deterrent. In {{response to this}} <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>events,</b> the Air Force stepped up their policy by press release efforts against the Army, as well as agitating behind the scenes within the Defense Department.|$|E
5|$|Dream Theater {{began their}} tour {{in support of}} A Dramatic <b>Turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Events</b> on July 4, 2011 in Rome, Italy. The second leg of the tour took place in North America, where the band headlined with Trivium. After a short break to {{conclude}} 2011, the band returned to Europe with Periphery, then to North America with Crimson Projekct before heading to South America for the final leg of the tour. On August 19 and 20, they filmed two shows at Luna Park in Buenos Aires, Argentina for a live Blu-ray release.|$|E
5|$|Isolated {{inside the}} Tower, the royal {{government}} {{was in a}} state of shock at the <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>events.</b> The King left the castle that morning and made his way to negotiate with the rebels at Mile End in east London, taking only a very small bodyguard with him. The King left Sudbury and Hales behind in the Tower, either for their own safety or because Richard had decided it would be safer to distance himself from his unpopular ministers. Along the way, several Londoners accosted the King to complain about alleged injustices.|$|E
50|$|The merger fails, {{in large}} part due to voter apathy, and this major setback in her plans, {{combined}} with a chronic lack of sleep and deep depression, is enough to cause Jammu to commit suicide; meanwhile, tragic <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> end in Barbara Probst being accidentally killed, Martin's family fractured forever due to hidden causes he cannot understand.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{fortunate}} <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>event,</b> which changed Naval's {{fortune and}} life was when Navajbai wife of Ratanji Tata adopted Naval {{while he was}} still at the orphanage. Naval was 13 when he was adopted by Lady Tata. [...] Naval later graduated from Bombay University in Economics and proceeded to London for a short course in Accountancy.|$|R
50|$|Often {{the leaders}} {{are the first}} to change loyalties, for they have had access to privileged {{information}} and are more aware of the hopelessness of the situation for their former cause. This is especially apparent in dictatorships and authoritarian states when most of the population has been fed propaganda and triumphalism and has been kept in the dark about important <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>events.</b>|$|R
5|$|On 17 July, Susi Kentikian defended {{all of her}} titles {{once again}} against Mexico's Arely Mucino. In a disappointing <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>events,</b> the bout was stopped {{in the third round}} after an {{accidental}} clash of heads left Kentikian with an injury, leaving her unable to continue. The fight was declared a no contest. Up until the stoppage, Kentikian was giving Mucino problems with her fast combinations, in and out attacks and power shots.|$|E
5|$|The {{eruption}} of Thera, {{which according to}} archaeological data occurred in c. 1500 BC, resulted in {{the decline of the}} Minoan civilization of Crete. This <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> gave the opportunity to the Mycenaeans to spread their influence throughout the Aegean. Around c. 1450 BC, they were in control of Crete itself, including Knossos, and colonized several other Aegean islands, reaching as far as Rhodes. Thus the Mycenaeans became the dominant power of the region, marking the beginning of the Mycenaean 'Koine' era (from , common), a highly uniform culture that spread in mainland Greece and the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|The train derails en route, {{forcing the}} duo to proceed on foot. As they fight through the disorganized Combine forces and rampant alien infestations, Kleiner {{appears on the}} screens Breen once used to pass out propaganda, and gives out useful updates to the {{evacuating}} citizens about the latest <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> as well as reiterating the Citadel's imminent collapse. Alyx and Gordon eventually meet up with Barney Calhoun {{and a group of}} other survivors who are preparing to move on a train station to escape City 17. Alyx and Gordon provide cover for the passengers as they board.|$|E
50|$|A special {{boundary}} commission {{was sent to}} delinate the Greek-Albanian border. However, being unable to delinate the area on an ethnographic basis, it fell back upon economic, strategic and geographical arguments, {{which resulted in the}} decision of the London Conference to cede most of the disputed area to Albania. This <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>event</b> catalyzed an uprising among the local Greek population, who declared the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus.|$|R
5000|$|The News Journal {{described}} {{the book as}} being filled with [...] "wisecrack anecdotes" [...] and [...] "amazing facts, ludicrous <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>events,</b> and hilarious quotes." [...] Baseball historian Stew Thornley {{described the}} book as [...] "compilation of strange but supposedly true baseball tales", but questioned the veracity of the Oyler story, saying that Bryson [...] "provides more details and great embellishment but did not give {{the date of the}} game." ...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{opens with}} a scene of a happy and {{successful}} community as they share their lot with one another, {{but there is a}} sudden <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>event</b> as three strange beings invade the kingdom in search of an antique; which has the power to protect its people and sustain its royalty. The kingdom’s warriors are overpowered and the invaders take away the sacred emblem, thereby bringing a curse on the land.|$|R
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), the {{subsequent}} peace treaties ceded the region to Albania. This <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> catalyzed an uprising among the local Greeks, which led to the Northern Epirote Declaration of Independence, on February 28, 1914. The International Commission of Control, an organization responsible for securing peace and stability in the region, eventually intervened and the Protocol of Corfu was signed on May 17, 1914. However the protocol’s terms were never implemented because of the politically unstable situation in Albania following the outbreak of World War I, and it was eventually annulled in 1921 during the Conference of Ambassadors.|$|E
5|$|Fighting soon erupted between {{elements}} of the Pathet Lao and the Royal Lao Army. Although tentative negotiations resumed between the factions, matters took {{a turn for the}} worse when neutralist Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma was arrested during a right-wing coup attempt. U.S. Ambassador Leonard Unger then notified the generals that the U.S. government would continue to support Souvanna. This <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> had a profound effect on Laotian politics: First, it affirmed American support for Souvannah, only a few years after the U.S. had denounced him as a tool of the leftists; It also caused the neutralists to shift political allies from the left to the right; Finally, in May 1964, Souvannah announced the political union of the rightists and neutralists against the left.|$|E
5|$|Following Houston's loss to Utah, McGrady {{underwent}} {{arthroscopic surgery}} on both {{his left shoulder}} and left knee. Early in the 2008–09 season, he missed 18 games, including a two-week stretch in January as his knee was not fully healed from his offseason surgery. On February 24, he had microfracture surgery in Chicago, forcing him to miss {{the remainder of the}} year. By then, his averages had declined to 15.6 points and 4.4 rebounds per game. In a surprise <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>events,</b> the Rockets qualified for the playoffs without McGrady and advanced to the second round, pushing the eventual-champion Los Angeles Lakers to seven games.|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} aims {{to analyze}} the rules about parity democracy in Regional statutes and electoral laws (including the transitional State discipline), with instruments as gender electoral quotas and double gender preference: they will be dealt with {{paying attention to the}} evolution of the juridical and political context. This can appear as a three-act play (with a prologue) : its plot is rich <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>events,</b> its structure is marked by some decisions of the Italian Constitutional Court...|$|R
50|$|Local factions with papal support ousted {{the family}} in 1327-29 and again in 1359-75, and at other <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> the bishops were {{expelled}} by the Ordelaffi. Until the Renaissance the Ordelaffi strived to maintain the possession {{of the city and}} its countryside, especially against Papal attempts to assert back their authority. Often civil wars between members of the family occurred. They also fought as condottieri for other states to earn themselves money to protect or embellish Forlì.|$|R
50|$|Game 6 of the 1975 World Series is {{regarded}} by most {{as one of}} the greatest World Series games ever played. It found the Boston Red Sox winning in the 12th inning in Fenway Park, defeating the Cincinnati Reds to force a seventh and deciding game. The game is best remembered for its exciting lead changes, nail-biting <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>events,</b> and a game-winning walk-off home run by Carlton Fisk, resulting in a 7-6 Red Sox victory.|$|R
5|$|Irene {{remained}} {{confined in}} a palace at the Harbour of Eleutherios {{in the capital}} and retained her formal title as empress. Then, on 15 January 792, for reasons not clear, she was recalled to the imperial palace with her title as empress and co-ruler confirmed and her name restored in the imperial acclamations. Staurakios too {{seems to have been}} recalled and, along with Irene, again took {{an active role in the}} governance of the state. This <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> drove the Armeniacs once again to mutiny, but their commander, Alexios Mosele, was in Constantinople. Despite guarantees of safety, Mosele was imprisoned and later blinded at the instigation of Irene and Staurakios, both eager to take revenge for his role in their overthrow in 790.|$|E
5|$|Psycho {{has become}} one of the most {{recognizable}} films in cinema history, and is arguably Hitchcock's best known film. In his novel, Bloch used an uncommon plot structure: he repeatedly introduced sympathetic protagonists, then killed them off. This played on his reader's expectations of traditional plots, leaving them uncertain and anxious. Hitchcock recognized the effect this approach could have on audiences, and utilized it in his adaptation, killing off Leigh's character at the end of the first act. This daring plot device, coupled with the fact that the character was played by the biggest box-office name in the film, was a shocking <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Rejecting this <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>events,</b> Rin travels {{back into}} the {{artificial}} world again (this time created by Riki and Rin) and helps Riki overcome his weakness. Afterwards, {{the two of them}} go back to waking up at the crash site. This time, Riki and Rin work together to save everyone at the crash scene. Kyousuke, who sneaked onto the bus (as a third year he was not allowed to go), managed to block the leak hole on the gas tank to delay the explosion, despite his injuries being far greater than anyone else. Everyone in the bus recovers from their injuries, although Kyousuke's recovery takes longer due to extensive injuries. Finally, after Kyousuke returns, he rents a minibus, {{and the members of the}} Little Busters set out for a trip to the ocean.|$|E
50|$|National {{psychology}} {{has sometimes}} been used to explain why economic development occurred {{in a different way}} in different countries, or why a particular <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> political <b>events</b> happened as it did.|$|R
50|$|After {{his dream}} is finally fulfilled, Eitaro's {{relationship}} with girls change suddenly: he starts feeling more secure {{of himself and}} sex, and meet lots of girls, though a series of humorous as well as tense events which intertwine as each chapter progresses. Three of these girls {{will have a very}} important part on his life (Ninomiya Emu, Ide Miho and Jii Shinako) and his love adventures revolves around those and other women he happens to encounter, mostly during unexpected <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>events.</b>|$|R
50|$|On September 18 Gen. Zhang Xueliang {{declared}} {{his support for}} Chiang. Two days later Zhang's Northeast Army entered the Shanhai Pass. These <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> resulted in the coalition of Yan and Feng collapsing almost immediately. The Shanxi Army withdrew {{to the north of}} the Yellow River, while the Northwest Army was totally defeated. On November 4 Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang announced their retirement. Yan fled to Dalian and Feng's troops were annexed by Zhang. The conflict was now over.|$|R
5|$|The BORAX Experiments were {{a series}} of {{destructive}} tests of boiling water reactors conducted by Argonne National Laboratory in Idaho. The BORAX-1 test was conducted under Zinn's supervision in 1954. He had the control rods removed {{to demonstrate that the}} reactor would shut down without trouble, and it immediately blew up with a loud bang and a tall column of dark smoke, a <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> that he had not anticipated. He shouted to Harold Lichtenberg to put the control rods back in again, but Lichtenberg pointed out that one was already flying through the air. Zinn later had to testify on the experiment before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} {{reaction to}} this latest <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> was varied and greatly colored by national interests. The British were unwilling to defend Madagascar's sovereignty for fear that the French might retaliate and fail to recognize the British claim to certain protectorates of its own. All official British engagement with Madagascar was henceforth transacted through the French resident, but these communiques were not officially recognized by Ranavalona and her court. The United States and Germany, on the other hand, continued to deal directly with the queen's government as the rightful authority in Madagascar. This discrepancy forced a reinterpretation of {{one aspect of the}} treaty, resulting in the queen's authority over internal affairs being maintained.|$|E
5|$|This <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> {{convinced}} Martín de Ursúa that Kan Ek' {{would not}} surrender peacefully, {{and he began}} to organise an all-out assault on Nojpetén. The enlistment of previously authorised reinforcements was now urgent, but was hindered when 70 of 100 soldiers mutinied and never reached García's camp. Work on the road was redoubled and about a month after the battle at Ch'ich' the Spanish arrived at the lakeshore, now supported by artillery. Again a large number of canoes gathered, and the nervous Spanish soldiers opened fire with cannons and muskets; no casualties were reported among the Itza, who retreated and raised a white flag from a safe distance.|$|E
5000|$|The play {{is known}} as one of the biggest hits on Broadway, running for four years with almost 1800 performances. The preface to the {{published}} script describes it as [...] "something so evil that it infects all who touch it. The thing has a life of its own. In Deathtrap, Levin has taken the basic components of thrillers and horror stories; murder, deceit, innocent dialogue with hidden sinister meanings, plot reversals, unexpected <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>events,</b> etc., and twisted and rearranged the pieces again and again." ...|$|R
40|$|In this article, I {{explore how}} the {{traditional}} understanding of uncertainty in project management can be revised {{in light of}} the philosophical input from Kierkegaard, Dewey, and Wittgenstein. Planning models of projects tend to view uncertainty as a threat to successful project implementation. An alternative approach can emerge from a philosophical investigation of the potentials embedded in surprising <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>events.</b> It is possible to retain a planning orientation to projects while also embracing uncertainty as a potentially energizing dimension of projects—one that can activate positive personal and collective drama in project management...|$|R
40|$|According to Lotman in {{the later}} stage of his work, the {{historical}} process consists of periods of stable and predictable <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> and "explosions" which can change {{the direction in which}} culture develops. The vector of this change is impossible to predict a priori. The theory of "explosion", in which coincidence and the extra-structural (human) factor determine the development o the historical process, is at the heat of his view on the way the semiosphere is organised and organises itself. The article confronts yhis model of cultural change with empirical material concerning grass-root experiences of the "great change" at the <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the 80 s and 90 s...|$|R
