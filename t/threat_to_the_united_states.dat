In its findings, the commission concluded that Iraq, Iran, and North Korea could develop intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities in five to ten years and that U.S. intelligence would have little warning before such systems were deployed.|$|E

In his memoirs, Kennan argued that containment did not demand a militarized U.S. foreign policy.

The high cost of maintaining and operating battleships as part of the United States Navy's active fleet became uneconomical; as a result, Wisconsin was decommissioned on 30 September 1991 after 14 total years of active service, and joined the Reserve Fleet at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. [...] She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register (NVR) on 12 January 1995, then on 15 October 1996, she was moved to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, and on 12 February 1998, she was restored to the Naval Vessel Register. On 7 December 2000, the battleship was towed from Portsmouth, Virginia and berthed adjacent to Nauticus, The National Maritime Center in Norfolk. On 16 April 2001 the battleship's weather decks were opened to the public by the Hampton Roads Naval Museum, a U.S. Navy museum charged with Wisconsins interpretation and public visitation. The ship was still owned by the Navy and was considered part of the mothball fleet.|$|E

In the interview with Larry King, Trump was optimistic about his chances indicating a [...] "very strong possibility" [...] of victory. He referenced a non-scientific National Enquirer poll of 100 individuals, showing him in first place against his Democratic and Republican counterparts. [...] When pressed, Trump identified Oprah Winfrey as his ideal choice for a running mate, describing her as [...] "somebody that is very special," [...] and that if she agreed to run, [...] "she'd be fantastic [...] [...] [...] she's popular, she's brilliant, she's a wonderful woman." [...] Oprah's spokesperson later responded [...] "at this point in time [...] [...] [...] Oprah is not running." [...] Trump labeled Rudy Giuliani the greatest Mayor of New York and spoke admirably of Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan, saying that Reagan had a demeanor that contributed to a phenomenal spirit in the nation. [...] Trump argued that President Bill Clinton could have been a great president, but destroyed his legacy with the Lewinsky scandal. [...] As for the Reform Party, Trump offered praise for both Perot and Ventura, and attacked potential primary opponent Buchanan as someone [...] "enamored" [...] with Adolf Hitler, based on Buchanan's thesis that Hitler presented no military <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> ahead of World War II.|$|E

500|$|Under the Shah of Iran, the United States was {{the largest}} seller of arms to Iran, and the vast {{majority}} of the weapons that the Islamic Republic of Iran inherited in January 1979 were American. To maintain this arsenal, Iran required a steady supply of spare parts to replace those broken and worn out. After Iranian students had stormed the American embassy in Tehran in November 1979 and taken 52 Americans hostage, President Jimmy Carter had imposed an arms embargo on Iran. After Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980, Iran had a desperate need for weapons and spare parts to maintain its current weapons. After Ronald Reagan took office as President on 20 January 1981, he vowed to continue Carter's policy of blocking arms sales to Iran on the grounds that Iran was a supporter of terrorism. A group of senior Reagan administration officials in the Senior Interdepartmental Group conducted a secret study on 21 July 1981, which concluded that the arms embargo was ineffective as Iran could always buy arms and spare parts for its American weapons elsewhere, while at the same time the arms embargo opened the door for Iran to fall into the Soviet sphere of influence as the Kremlin could sell Iran weapons if the United States would not. The conclusion was that the United States should start selling Iran arms as soon as it was politically possible to keep Iran from falling into the Soviet sphere of influence. [...] At the same time, the openly declared goal of Ayatollah Khomeini to export his Islamic revolution all over the Middle East and overthrow the governments of Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the other Persian Gulf states led to the Americans perceiving Khomeini as a major <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> In the spring of 1983, the United States launched Operation Staunch, a wide-ranging diplomatic effort to persuade other nations all over the world not to sell arms or spare parts for weapons to Iran. At least part of the reason why the Iran–Contra affair proved so humiliating for the United States when the story first broke in November 1986 that the US was selling arms to Iran was that American diplomats as part of Operation Staunch had, from the spring of 1983 on, been lecturing other nations about how morally wrong it was to sell arms to the Islamic Republic of Iran and applying strong pressure to prevent any arms sales to Iran.|$|E
