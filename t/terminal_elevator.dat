5|$|In mid-1913, Howe {{journeyed to}} Northwestern Ontario {{to take up}} his new post. The Board was {{headquartered}} in Fort William, Ontario, where Canadian wheat was transferred from rail to ship. The Board sought to build a series of large <b>terminal</b> grain <b>elevators,</b> which could process as well as store grain. The project would increase both capacity and competition—grain elevator companies had been accused by farmers' interests of charging excessive prices. The first such elevator for the Board was raised in nearby Port Arthur, Ontario, and was acclaimed {{as one of the}} best grain elevators ever built in Canada, and one of the cheapest. Over the next two years, Howe traveled the West, supervising the construction of <b>terminal</b> <b>elevators</b> near major cities and ports. The capacity would be needed, as Canadian farmers increased production during the First World War.|$|R

5000|$|The Act was amended in 1919 {{by adding}} s. 95(7) which {{provided}} that, {{if at the}} end of any crop year in any <b>terminal</b> <b>elevator</b> [...] "the total surplus of grain is found in excess of one-quarter of one per cent of the gross amount of the grain received in the elevator during the crop year," [...] such surplus would be sold {{for the benefit of the}} Board.|$|E
50|$|Enid hit {{its peak}} {{with a total}} grain storage {{capacity}} of 80,000,000 bushels in 1987. The 1980 grain embargo instated by President Jimmy Carter, a poor economy, and drought lead to the closure {{of several of the}} elevators. In 1989, the Union Equity Co-Operative Exchange Elevators A and B and the Oklahoma Wheat Pool <b>Terminal</b> <b>Elevator</b> were shut down. Enid continues to have the largest grain storage capacity in the United States and the third largest in the world.|$|E
50|$|The {{grading system}} unduly {{emphasized}} color {{and weight of}} the kernel rather than the milled value, and encouraged mixing at the <b>terminal</b> <b>elevators.</b> Partridge proposed to replace this by a market where buyers could make their offer based on visual inspection of the grain being sold, {{eliminating the need for}} grading and letting sellers and buyers interact directly. The end result would also be to eliminate speculation in grain futures, with exporters buying stored grain only as needed based on samples.The far-reaching reform proposals of the Partridge Plan thus addressed a wide range of farmer's concerns.|$|R
50|$|Partridge {{resigned}} {{as president of}} the GGGC at the 1907 convention, in part because the company's original cooperative structure had been modified to meet the requirements of the Grain Exchange, in part because he was not interested in running the company he had launched.Early in 1908 Partridge convinced the Saskatchewan Grain Growers' Association (SGGA) to endorse the principle that inland grain elevators should be owned by the province and <b>terminal</b> <b>elevators</b> by the Dominion of Canada. The Manitoba association passed a resolution supporting this proposal at their convention.In 1917 the GGGC merged with the Alberta Farmers' Co-operative Elevator Company, founded in 1913, to form the United Grain Growers (UGG), which provided grain marketing, handling and supply until 2001.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Bulk grain is a dynamic, {{immature}} ecosystem with non-germinating seeds as “producers. ” Communities and {{populations of}} insects, mites, microflora, and occasionally vertebrates such as birds or rodents become {{associated with the}} seed, forming {{an integral part of}} the stored-grain ecosystem. Canada annually produces an average of 52 million tonnes of cereals. Most of this grain is stored on the farm, delivered to primary elevators, and finally moved by rail to <b>terminal</b> <b>elevators</b> on the coast or on the Great Lakes for sale abroad. There are 146 species of insects found in grain storage and cereal-processing facilities, but only 10 – 15 species occur frequently and most are beetles. Moths are often a problem in heated warehouses and <b>terminal</b> <b>elevators</b> in western and eastern Canada, especially from May through September. Climate, weather, and incoming grain condition dictate which species will become established and lead to major infestation. The diversity of insects and mites and levels of infestations in Canada are less than those in more moderate climates because Canada has a colder climate that limits the growth and population development of these species. Most farm-stored grain contains low levels of insects and mites, and they multiply and become a problem only during the warmer period after harvest. The most common insect pests in grain in western Canada are Cryptolestes ferrugineus and Tribolium castaneum, species that have very high rates of population increase (60 - to 70 -fold per month). Sitophilus granarius and Plodia interpunctella have greater cold hardiness than does T. castaneum, but they have rates of increase of only 15 - t...|$|R

50|$|The {{need for}} grain {{transportation}} {{has led to}} the continued improvement of Enid's infrastructure. In addition to being a grain storage hub, Enid was a rail hub for the Cherokee Outlet. The first elevator built in Enid, the Enid <b>Terminal</b> <b>Elevator,</b> is located next to the Van Buren overpass next to Enid's main rail hub, five of the elevators are on the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad tracks or connecting lines in the north part of town, and U.S. Highway 64 runs in an east-west direction just to the south of Elevators Y and Z.|$|E
50|$|During his administration, Shortridge {{approved}} {{the issuance of}} $50,000 in bonds to construct the south wing of the state capitol and {{approved the}} purchase of an executive mansion for the governor's residence. He also supported an appropriation for a state elevator at Duluth, Minnesota. An out-of-state <b>terminal</b> <b>elevator</b> was not constructed largely due to a provision requiring North Dakota sovereignty over any elevator site. The bill passed, but the provision that Minnesota or Wisconsin would have to cede sovereignty over the site created an unacceptable situation for both states. Governor Shortridge retired from office after one term. He was appointed clerk of the General Land Office at Devils Lake, North Dakota.|$|E
40|$|Barley is an {{important}} crop in the upper Great Plains, yet its economic importance has not been quantified. Expenditures and returns from crop production, grain handling, transportation, and processing activities represented the direct economic impacts from the barley industry. Secondary economic impacts were estimated using an input-output model. Barley production in the tri-state region averaged 3. 3 million planted acres and 165 million bushels from 1994 through 1996. North Dakota had about 2. 5 million acres. Barley production was estimated to generate $ 446 million in direct economic impacts. Total (direct and secondary) annual economic impacts from barley production were estimated at $ 1. 2 billion. Annual direct impacts from handling barley at country (local) <b>elevators</b> and <b>terminal</b> <b>elevators</b> in the region were estimated at $ 13 million. Total annual economic impacts from grain handling activities were estimated at $ 37 million. Annual regional expenditures and returns from transporting barley from country and <b>terminal</b> <b>elevators</b> to various market destinations were estimated at $ 47 million. Total annual economic impacts from barley transportation were estimated at $ 122 million. Impacts from barley processing were limited to regional malting of barley produced in the tri-state region. Annual direct impacts from barley processing were estimated at $ 58 million. Total annual economic impacts from barley processing were estimated at $ 180 million. Processing activities employed 431 full-time jobs, while overall economic activity from the industry supported 18, 450 secondary full-time equivalent jobs. The barley industry was responsible for generating $ 32 million annually in sales and use, corporate income, and personal income taxes. Annual economic impacts from all barley activities were estimated at $ 1. 5 billion in the tri-state region. Total economic impacts in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota were estimated at $ 1. 1 billion, $ 70 million, and $ 371 million, respectively. barley, upper Great Plains, economic impact, Production Economics,...|$|R
50|$|The {{marketing}} of wheat was modernized as well, {{as the cost}} of transportation steadily fell and more and more distant markets opened up. Before 1850, the crop was sacked, shipped by wagon or canal boat, and stored in warehouses. With the rapid growth of the nation's railroad network in the 1850s-1870s, farmers took their harvest by wagon for sale to the nearest country elevators. The wheat moved to <b>terminal</b> <b>elevators,</b> where it was sold through grain exchanges to flour millers and exporters. Since the elevators and railroads generally had a local monopoly, farmers soon had targets besides the weather for their complaints. They sometimes accused the elevator men of undergrading, shortweighting, and excessive dockage. Scandinavian immigrants in the Midwest took control over marketing through the organization of cooperatives.|$|R
