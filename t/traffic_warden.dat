5|$|Abum tells another story, {{which he}} {{believes}} shows that mankind no longer needs demonic temptation to be damned. Abum followed an everyman figure called Brock, watching his grindingly repetitive life. Brock visited {{a strip club}} often but without joy, which led Abum to believe he no longer took pleasure from sinning. One day, Abum added an additional irritation to Brock's life, posing as a <b>traffic</b> <b>warden</b> and giving him a ticket. This was enough to drive Brock to suicide. However, during this time, Abum also encountered Black, who again saw his demonic nature.|$|E
5|$|At about 9:20am on Saturday 15 June 1996, the Ford van {{was parked}} on Corporation Street, outside the Marks & Spencer store, near the Arndale Centre. After setting the bomb's timer, two men – wearing hooded jackets, {{baseball}} caps and sunglasses – left {{the vehicle and}} walked to Cathedral Street, where a third man picked {{them up in the}} Ford Granada. The truck had been parked on double yellow lines with its hazard lights flashing. Within three minutes a <b>traffic</b> <b>warden</b> had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal. At about 9:40am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming that there was a bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour. The caller had an Irish accent and gave an IRA codeword so that police would know the threat was genuine. Four other telephoned warnings were sent to television/radio stations, newspapers and a hospital.|$|E

In Germany, Bohemians shocked the hosts by winning 1–0 thanks to a goal from Glen Crowe, and were unlucky not to score more (even having a goal ruled out for off-side). Bohemians were out of Europe, and had made history by achieving successive away victories in European competition.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Amanda Root for The Musical Express magazine, Ullman was asked about critics labeling the show 'non-sexist humour.' Did it exist? [...] "Not unless it’s cleverly done. When we did Three of a Kind we kept getting sketches sent in about me as a <b>traffic</b> <b>warden,</b> or me being a busty barmaid. Writers that have no idea about women - their typical way of starting a sketch is to say, Tracey is sitting there, filing her nails and chewing gum, as if all girls are stupid. Sketches beginning like that used to really get on my nerves. But {{as soon as we}} found the right team of writers, they weren’t into that sort of thing, so it worked out OK."

50|$|Traffic wardens are {{employees}} of police forces and are {{primarily responsible for}} controlling traffic in general using powers available to authorised persons defined in the Road Traffic Act 1988. Their usage for parking enforcement is less common {{since the advent of}} decriminalised parking enforcement which in many areas transferred the enforcement of offences concerning simple parking in controlled areas to local authorities; other parking offences such as any involving penalty points and/or those not involving the 1991 Act (or equivalent in Northern Ireland) remain enforceable by traffic wardens. Traffic wardens in the Metropolitan Police could be promoted to <b>traffic</b> <b>warden</b> supervisor, <b>traffic</b> <b>warden</b> controller, senior <b>traffic</b> <b>warden</b> controller, and area <b>traffic</b> <b>warden</b> controller.|$|E

50|$|The chief {{rationale}} behind this provision within the Act was, amongst other reasons, {{to make sure}} people didn't end up being criminalised for car parking offences, like one may potentially become with some driving offences. However, some parking offences can still be enforced by the police with fines, failure to comply with which could lead to criminal proceedings and even the adding of points on the driving licence of the offender. Such parking offences enforced by police <b>traffic</b> <b>wardens</b> are parking contraventions committed in red routes (red routes are usually identified with red lines marked on the roads with the relevant time plates). Police <b>traffic</b> <b>wardens</b> can also enforce parked vehicles on pedestrian zig-zags/crossings, whether committed on red or yellow routes.|$|R
