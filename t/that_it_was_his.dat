5|$|Player Alex Govan is {{credited}} with popularising the song, by singing it on the coach {{on the way to}} the quarter final and when he revealed in an interview <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> favourite.|$|E
5|$|Czolgosz {{had lost}} his job during the {{economic}} Panic of 1893 and turned to anarchism, a political philosophy adhered to by recent killers of foreign leaders. Regarding McKinley {{as a symbol of}} oppression, Czolgosz was convinced <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> duty as an anarchist to kill him. Unable to get near the President during the presidential visit earlier, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice as the President reached to shake his hand in the reception line at the temple. One bullet grazed McKinley; the other entered his abdomen and was never found.|$|E
5|$|De Hauteclocque {{broke his}} leg {{in two places}} in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> own fault for riding on the {{shoulder}} of the road. Thereafter he frequently walked with a cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, he told them that when you have done something really stupid, it is best to admit it.|$|E

5|$|The {{director}} of the episode, Dominic Polcino, greatly enjoyed the episode, and claims <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> favorite episode <b>that</b> he directed.|$|R
5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of Bradman, generally regarded as the greatest batsman of all time, {{and the fact that}} he had announced <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> farewell international tour, the Australians were greeted with much fanfare across the country, and many records for match attendances were broken. The record for Test attendance at a match in England was broken three times, in the Second, Third and Fourth Tests, and stands to this day.|$|E
5|$|During the off-season, {{trade talks}} were conducted, but not completed, between the Beaneaters and the Philadelphia Quakers. The deal likely {{involved}} Stivetts and Tucker, two players involved in Boston's religious quarrel {{from the previous}} season. As the season progressed, the press noted that his season had begun better than the previous season. Stivetts claimed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> weight loss (now just over 200lbs), {{that was the main}} reason why he had been more of an asset to the team than in past years.|$|E
5|$|Filming was {{completed}} in 37 days in several locations of Rajasthan. Since most of the old palaces in Rajasthan have been converted into hotels, the crew stayed at a palace resort called Manwar. They resided at a palace resort in Pokhran, while filming was done at Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur. Kukunoor, after completion of the shooting, said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> most challenging film as it involved a real-life story.|$|E

5000|$|A mother {{questions}} her son {{about the}} blood on his sword. He puts her off with claims <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> hawk or his horse, in some combination, but finally admits <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> brother, or his father, whom he has killed. He declares that he is leaving and will never return, and various creatures (wife, children, livestock) will have to fare without him. His mother then asks what she will get from his departure. He answers [...] "a curse from hell" [...] and implicates his mother in the murder.|$|R
5|$|He had a paternalistic {{attitude}} towards his subjects and believed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> duty {{to treat the}} Chinese and foreign ethnic groups as equals under one ruler. Taizong's views grew into state policy as his government recruited Turkic and other non-Han Chinese soldiers into the Tang military. Turkic soldiers were later promoted to higher ranks as commanders and generals. The surname of Li, belonging to the royal family of Li Shimin, was awarded to Han and non-Han officers for their service.|$|E
5|$|Picard finds Bok {{waiting for}} him, who has another orb. Bok {{explains}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> son {{in command of}} the Ferengi vessel at Maxia, and he came here seeking his revenge. He places the orb down and leaves Picard on the Stargazer bridge. The orb lights up once more, leaving Picard believing he is once again at the Battle of Maxia. On the Enterprise, Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) and Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn) discover the orb brought over from the Stargazer in Picard's chest. They take it to Riker as the Stargazer powers up its weapon systems. Riker hails the Ferengi vessel and speaks to Kazago, who is suspicious {{at the sight of the}} orb, which is a banned device. He promises to investigate.|$|E
5|$|Scott broke George Pinkney's MLB {{consecutive}} games played streak of 577 on April 26, 1920. He again led AL shortstops in fielding percentage. The Red Sox named Scott team captain for the 1921 season, after the previous captain, Harry Hooper, {{was traded to}} the Chicago White Sox. During spring training in 1921, Scott dealt with leg cramp that threatened his playing streak, but he was able to continue playing. Scott had 62 runs batted in on the season, and stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> goal to play in 1,000 {{consecutive games}}.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Schellenberg {{was part}} of the Grand Alliance's {{campaign}} of 1704 to prevent the Franco-Bavarian army from threatening Vienna, the capital of Habsburg Austria. The campaign began in earnest on 19 May when the Duke of Marlborough began his 250-mile (400km) march from Bedburg near Cologne towards the Elector of Bavaria's and Marshal Marsin's Franco-Bavarian army on the Danube. Marlborough had initially deceived the French commanders– Marshal Villeroi in the Spanish Netherlands and Marshal Tallard along the Rhine– into thinking his target was Alsace or the Moselle farther to the north. However, when the Elector was notified on 5 June of Marlborough's march from the Low Countries, he had correctly predicted <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> principality of Bavaria that was the Allies' real target.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} well {{received}} by critics such as Daniel Kalabakov of RPGFan, who claimed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> favorite Super Nintendo Entertainment System-era Square soundtrack, {{primarily due to}} the mixture of techno and jazz. He preferred Shimomura's techno tracks, but enjoyed the way the two styles mixed together. Kero Hazel of Square Enix Music Online similarly praised the mix of the two styles, though he criticized the sound quality of the album and stated that the album would have been improved by using real instruments rather than synthesized ones.|$|E
5|$|The film had regular showings in many theaters worldwide, {{with many}} as a monthly event. Fans {{interact}} with the film {{in a similar fashion}} to The Rocky Horror Picture Show; audience members dress up as their favorite characters, throw plastic spoons in reference to an unexplained framed photo of a spoon on a table in Johnny's living room, toss footballs to each other from short distances, and yell insulting comments {{about the quality of the}} film as well as lines from the film itself. Wiseau has claimed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> intent for audiences to find humor in the film, although viewers and some of the cast members generally have viewed it as a poorly-made drama.|$|E
50|$|He is {{a son of}} Olimpija's former captain Miha Šporar. Andraž Šporar has {{revealed}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> ambition to earn a move to Liverpool at some stage in his career.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{his songs}} employ a string section, most notably on his American Landscape (1997) and Orchestral Stories (2005) albums. He has said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> dream to release a symphonic album.|$|R
50|$|Bishop. An intellectually {{disabled}} child. He {{is the son}} of Rayber, and {{the cousin}} of Tarwater. Tarwater believes <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> destiny to baptize Bishop, whereas Rayber struggles to prevent this from happening.|$|R
5|$|The glyphs {{are divided}} into three categories: in{{dependent}}, compound, and dependent (glyphs that only appear in combination with others). He sees other groupings as being arbitrary, as well as detrimental to the proper understanding of rongorongo. Contrary to other scholars who do not place importance on compound glyphs, Dietrich sees compounding as a major aspect of the system. In fact, Dietrich describes rongorongo as a network in which the characters are interwoven together through various combinations. He speculates <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> background in graphic design {{that allowed him to}} perceive this pattern, while other researchers relied too heavily on linguistics and epigraphy.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{publicly}} testifies against Frank, prompting him {{to appear}} before the committee and resign the presidency. When an incredulous Claire confronts him, Franks says <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> plan all along to resign and set her up to be president, so {{that the two of them}} can run Washington together - she from the White House and he from the private sector. For the plan to work, Claire must pardon Frank, which would damage her politically. Frank resigns and Claire is sworn in as the 47th President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|A sexy belly dancer named Princess Kashmir {{arrives at}} the party and invites Homer on stage to dance with her. On {{the way to the}} {{restaurant}} bathroom, Bart wanders into the bachelor party room and eagerly snaps a picture of Homer and Kashmir. Bart brings the picture to school and gives a copy of it to Milhouse, who promptly gets requests from other students for a copy of the picture. It is not long before everyone in Springfield has one and Marge sees a copy of the picture at her aerobics class and is furious. When Homer gets home that day, Marge immediately shoves the picture in his face and demands an explanation. At that point, Bart inadvertently reveals <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> picture, angering both his parents. After sending Bart to his room, Marge emotionally kicks Homer out of the house. Homer spends the night at Barney's apartment.|$|E

50|$|Ringo the 4th is {{the sixth}} studio album by English {{musician}} Ringo Starr, released in 1977. Its title {{refers to the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> fourth rock album. Ringo the 4th has a more dance-oriented context.|$|R
2500|$|Grohl was {{apparently}} reduced to tears after performing the song at Neil Young's Bridge School Benefit. In {{the words of}} bandmate Taylor Hawkins, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a [...] "powerful song." [...] In 2000, David Letterman revealed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> favorite song.|$|R
5|$|Aiyer sent Ramanujan, {{with letters}} of introduction, to his {{mathematician}} friends in Madras. Some {{of them looked}} at his work and gave him letters of introduction to R. Ramachandra Rao, the district collector for Nellore {{and the secretary of}} the Indian Mathematical Society. Rao was impressed by Ramanujan's research but doubted <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> own work. Ramanujan mentioned a correspondence he had with Professor Saldhana, a notable Bombay mathematician, in which Saldhana expressed a lack of understanding of his work but concluded that he was not a phony. Ramanujan's friend C. V. Rajagopalachari tried to quell Rao's doubts about Ramanujan's academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance, and listened as Ramanujan discussed elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, and his theory of divergent series, which Rao said ultimately converted him to a belief in Ramanujan's brilliance. When Rao asked him what he wanted, Ramanujan replied that he needed work and financial support. Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his research, with Rao's financial aid taking care of his daily needs. With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work published in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{broke his}} nose at Craven Cottage on {{the opening day of}} the 1962–63 season, in a 2–1 defeat by Fulham. Leicester went to chase a {{possible}} double, reaching the FA Cup semi-finals whilst lying top of the table in April. City beat Liverpool 1–0 at Hillsborough to reach the final, with Banks keeping a clean sheet despite his goal being under a near-constant siege from the Merseyside club. The News of the World reported that Liverpool had had 34 attempts on goal to Leicester's one, and Banks later stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> finest performance at club level. Unluckily, Banks then broke a finger in a 2–1 defeat by West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns, and was out injured as Leicester lost their final three league games, ending the season in a disappointing fourth place. In the 1963 FA Cup Final Banks {{and the rest of the}} team underperformed, and lost the game 3–1 to Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|Druckmann {{soon became}} a {{research}} assistant at Florida State University, while living in Tallahassee, Florida. He spent {{a year at the}} university working at the Visualization Lab within the School of Computational Science and Information Technology, beginning in July 2002. During this time, he began developing the game Pink-Bullet, for Linux and Microsoft Windows, with some friends. At one point, he wanted to be an animator, which required enlisting in art classes, but his parents forbade him from doing so. After taking a programming class, Druckmann realized <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> preference, and began a Bachelor of Computer Science in December 2002, which he completed the following year. Druckmann moved to Pittsburgh, where he attended Carnegie Mellon University; in August 2003, he began his Master's degree in Entertainment Technology, which he earned in 2005 from the Entertainment Technology Center. In April 2004, Druckmann developed the game Dikki Painguin in: TKO for the Third Reich for the Nintendo Entertainment System as a student at Carnegie Mellon, in collaboration with fellow student Allan Blomquist.|$|E
500|$|Of {{an outspoken}} nature, {{he has had}} public fallings out with players, referees, chairmen, {{opposition}} players and managers, and authorities. The Guardian surmised this by saying that [...] "the feeling about Gannon <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>His</b> Way or the Highway." ...|$|R
