5|$|At {{the same}} time, there was common resentment against the reactionary attitudes {{prevailing}} in Court circles {{even before the}} uproar sparked by the notorious banquet precipitated the political aspects of the march.

5|$|The most {{important}} sources {{used by the}} evangelist were the Jewish scriptures (the Tanakh, more or less identical with the Christian Old Testament), probably in the Greek translation. John quotes from them directly, references important figures from them, and uses narratives from them {{as the basis for}} several of the discourses. But the author was also familiar with non-Jewish sources: the Logos of the prologue (<b>the</b> <b>Word</b> <b>that</b> is with God from the beginning of creation) derives from both the Jewish concept of Lady Wisdom and from the Greek philosophers, while John 6 alludes not only to the exodus but also to Greco-Roman mystery cults, while John 4 alludes to Samaritan messianic beliefs.|$|E

One version has Claudius selected as Emperor by the conspirators, another chosen by Gallienus on his death bed; the Historia Augusta was concerned to substantiate the descent of the Constantinian dynasty from Claudius, and this may explain its accounts, which do not involve Claudius in the murder. The other sources (Zosimus i.40 and Zonaras xii.25) report that the conspiracy was organized by Heraclianus, Claudius, and Aurelian.|$|E
25|$|The hyphens {{and lack}} of {{projection}} lines indicate prosodic dependencies. A hyphen that appears on {{the left of the}} clitic indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent on the word immediately to its left (He'll, There's), whereas a hyphen that appears {{on the right side of}} the clitic (not shown here) indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent on <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>that</b> appears immediately to its right. A given clitic is often prosodically dependent on its syntactic dependent (He'll, There's) or on its head (would've). At other times, it can depend prosodically on a word that is neither its head nor its immediate dependent (Florida's).|$|E
25|$|Though both Esperanto and Interlingua borrow {{primarily}} from European languages, they also borrow words from other languages {{which have become}} widespread. Two different philosophies have led to two different approaches. Interlingua highly regards etymological fidelity, thus it usually adopts <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>that</b> is the nearest common ancestor of the respective words {{in at least three}} source language units (considering Spanish and Portuguese together as one unit). Esperanto highly regards regularity, thus it disregards the form of the word in European languages to make it match Esperanto's morphology and phonemic orthography. For example, Interlingua has geisha (from Japanese 芸者), sheik (from Arabic شيخ), and kayak (from Inuit ᖃᔭᖅ); in Esperanto, these words are written gejŝo, ŝejko, and kajako.|$|E

The southern Muisca settlements and their treasures quickly fell to the conquistadors in 1537 and 1538. On the Bogotá savanna, the Spanish received reports about El Dorado from captured natives, and of the initiation rite of the new zipa, which used {{to take place in}} Lake Guatavita. The Spanish captured large amounts of gold from the Muisca, which led them to spread <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>that</b> El Dorado was near.|$|E
25|$|As a {{historical}} dictionary, the Oxford English Dictionary explains words by showing their development {{rather than merely}} their present-day usages. Therefore, it shows definitions in the order that {{the sense of the}} word began being used, including word meanings which are no longer used. Each definition is shown with numerous short usage quotations; in each case, the first quotation shows the first recorded instance of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>that</b> the editors are aware of and, in the case of words and senses no longer in current usage, the last quotation is the last known recorded usage. This allows the reader to get an approximate sense of the time period in which a particular word has been in use, and additional quotations help the reader to ascertain information about how the word is used in context, beyond any explanation that the dictionary editors can provide.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese spread <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>that</b> {{they were}} the 'Light of Asia'. Japan was the only Asian nation that had {{successfully}} transformed itself into a modern technological society {{at the end of}} the 19th century and it remained independent when most Asian countries had been under European or American power, and had beaten a European power, Russia, in war. Following its military campaign in China Japan turned its attention to Southeast Asia advocating to other Asians a 'Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere', which they described as a type of trade zone under Japanese leadership. The Japanese had gradually spread their influence through Asia in the first half of the 20th century and during the 1920s and 1930s had established business links in the Indies. These ranged from small town barbers, photographic studios and salesmen, to large department stores and firms such as Suzuki and Mitsubishi becoming involved in the sugar trade.|$|E
