5000|$|Model 1945 - This was a {{production}} model built in 1944-45, with an electrically powered turret <b>traverse</b> <b>motor,</b> an enlarged commander's cupola with a one-piece hatch, squared front fenders, and the TDP (tankovoy dimoviy pribor) smoke system with electrically detonated MDSh canisters.|$|E
50|$|Avenger {{suffered}} in trials as the engine had to remain running {{to power the}} tank's turret <b>traverse</b> <b>motor.</b> The noise and exhaust could give the vehicle's position away. Winter trials involving a prolonged stationary position also failed in comparison with Archer, when Avenger's steering failed. Both had problems with camouflage. The vehicle was dropped from trials in 1950, along with removal of its US derived equivalent, the Achilles.|$|E
5000|$|In Jordanian Army use {{the vehicle}} was altered with {{upgraded}} electrically-driven turret <b>traverse</b> <b>motors,</b> {{and a larger}} commander's cupola mounting a [...]50 calibre machine gun. These traverse-motors were driven from a separate electrical supply. Different radio equipment was also fitted.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{studied the}} nature of clumsiness in Mobius {{syndrome}} in terms of motor or sensory deficits, and sought to clarify the pathophysiological mechanism of the syndrome. Standardized electrophysiologic studies were conducted, with special emphasis on the long motor and sensory tracts and peripheral nerves, in seven Mobius patients with clumsiness, of whom six participated in MRI studies; five of them showing brainstem hypoplasia. All performed motor-evoked potentials were normal. In all patients, normal somatosensory-evoked potentials were recorded and peripheral nerve conduction assessment revealed no abnormalities. The electrophysiologic data indicate that the <b>traversing</b> <b>motor</b> and sensory tracts through the brainstem, and the peripheral nerves are not affected in Mobius syndrome...|$|R
5000|$|In {{common with}} British tank {{doctrine}} of the time, the vehicle was designed to fire on the move. The turret offered hydraulically powered turret <b>traverse</b> <b>motors</b> with proportional speed control. Later vehicles fitted an all-round view cupola for the commander to identify and track targets. Both gunner and commander had Vickers rotating and pivoting periscopes, while episcopes were fitted in the cupola. There was a 7.92 mm Besa machine gun mounted co-axially to the main armament, operated by the gunner. A second was gimbal mounted {{in the front of}} the hull, with 45 degrees horizontal and 25 degrees vertical movement. Sighting was by a No. 35 telescope, which was connected through a linkage to the mounting. In the top of the turret was a 2 inch [...] "bombthrower" [...] angled to fire forward. Thirty smoke grenades were carried for it.|$|R
50|$|The route was <b>traversed</b> by <b>motor</b> {{vehicles}} in the 1920s. While passable, sections of the road could be sandy, boggy, washed away in the winter, or rugged with boulders. Several creek crossings were required, though few were difficult. North of Alice Springs the road was in comparatively good condition, with sections allowing speeds of up to 50 mph.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: An {{obstacle}} course complete with wooden ramps and {{a path that}} <b>traversed</b> the Indianapolis <b>Motor</b> Speedway's landmark creek ditch in {{the southwest corner of}} the track was a featured event at the May 1910 race meet at the Brickyard.|$|R
2500|$|These {{guns were}} {{modified}} {{with a larger}} chamber for coast defense duties to handle the increased amount of propellant used for the special long-range Siegfried shells. Gander and Chamberlain quote a weight of only [...] for these guns, presumably accounting for the extra volume of the enlarged chamber. An armored single mount, the Bettungsschiessgerüst (Firing platform) C/39 was used by these guns. It had a maximum elevation of 60° and could traverse up to 360°, depending on the emplacement. The C/39 mount had two compartments; the upper housed the guns and their loading equipment, while the lower contained the ammunition hoists, their motors, and the elevation and <b>traverse</b> <b>motors.</b> The mount was fully powered and had an underground magazine. Normally these were placed in open concrete barbettes, relying on their armor, but Hitler {{thought that there was}} not enough protection for the guns (Battery Todt) emplaced on Cap-Gris-Nez in the Pas de Calais near Wimereux and ordered a concrete casemate [...] thick built over and around the mounts. This had the unfortunate effect of limiting their traverse to 120°. Other C/39 mounts were installed at the Hanstholm fortress in Denmark, and the Vara fortress in Kristiansand, Norway.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the track}} grousers {{could not be}} stored on {{the rear of the}} turret anymore, grouser racks that could be {{attached}} to the appliqué armor bosses on the hull were added to vehicles beginning in early April 1943. The M10 initially lacked any provision for indirect fire. In May 1943, an azimuth indicator and gunner's quadrant were added to the M10. The grouser racks and indirect fire equipment were often retrofitted to earlier vehicles. By late June 1943, it was realized that Fisher's initial counterweights were too heavy. Two newly designed counterweights reduced the total weight to 2,500 pounds and better distributed the weight of the gun. They resembled an upside-down [...] "duck bill" [...] shape when viewed from the side. To accommodate the new weights, the design of the upper rear of the turret was changed from sloped inwards to nearly vertical. In July 1943, the appliqué armor bosses on the hull sides and turret were dropped from production. The bosses on the glacis were retained. In late September 1943, a single M10 was tested with an Oilgear hydraulic <b>traversing</b> <b>motor</b> that could <b>traverse</b> the turret even without the counterweights, but this modification was not pursued as the production contracts were reaching their end.|$|R
50|$|In 1919 steps {{had already}} been taken to develop the {{important}} cotton and ground-nut industries, and experimental work in tobacco cultivation had been started. Later, in 1926, work was begun on a scheme for utilising {{the waters of the}} Kaduna River for the supply of the town. Progress was also made in the construction of new European hospitals at Enugu, Jos and Kano in the province. Another important event was the journey undertaken by Palmer from Lagos to Lake Chad in March and April, this being the first occasion on which the entire distance had been <b>traversed</b> by <b>motor</b> transport.|$|R
500|$|Meanwhile, on the left, {{the advance}} began on 28 November. On the map, Wareo was roughly [...] away from Sattelberg, however, {{due to the}} nature of the terrain, the actual {{distance}} to be travelled was estimated at being four times that. For the advancing Australian infantrymen, the burden was made even greater by heavy rain which turned the tracks over which they were advancing into a muddy morass that could not be <b>traversed</b> by <b>motor</b> transport. This, coupled with the unavailability of New Guineans to serve as bearers, meant that the Australians had to carry almost all of their own supplies on their backs. In an effort to keep the advance moving, the entire 2/24th Infantry Battalion was tasked with carrying supplies for the 2/23rd, which led the advance from Sattelberg.|$|R
50|$|The desert {{was first}} <b>traversed</b> by <b>motor</b> vehicle in 1919.During the Iraq War, the desert {{served as a}} major supply line for the Iraqi resistance, with the Iraq portion of the desert {{becoming}} a primary stronghold of the Sunni resistance operating in the Al Anbar Governorate, particularly after the Coalition capture of Fallujah during Operation Phantom Fury. A series of Coalition military operations were relatively ineffective at removing the resistance presence in the Desert. As the resistance began {{to gain control of}} the surrounding areas, coalition spokesmen began to downplay the importance of the Syrian desert as a center of operations; nevertheless the Syrian Desert remains one of the primary routes for smuggling equipment due to its location near the Syrian border. By September 2006 the resistance had gained control of virtually all of the Anbar Governorate and had moved most of their forces, equipment and leaders further east to resistance-controlled cities near the Euphrates river.|$|R
50|$|The {{river from}} the old {{powerhouse}} onwards is calm and level to its mouth in the St. Lawrence River. This section of the river is the only section that can be <b>traversed</b> by <b>motor</b> or power boats, but activity is light as Lake St. Lawrence is the draw for boating in the area (which is behind a pair of shipping locks and two dams if one were trying to travel from the Grasse to the lake). This was only possible during {{the construction of the}} old powerhouse, as the river was dredged to 15 ft along its course to the St. Lawrence. At the mouth of the Grasse River is Snell Lock, part of the St. Lawrence Seaway Shipping System. Several hundred yards upriver {{from the mouth of the}} Grasse is a docking area which contains a large floating crane with replacement doors for the locks, and the tugboat Robinson Bay, which is used for icebreaking in the spring.|$|R
50|$|The Matilda Senior weighed around 27 LT, {{more than}} twice as much as its predecessor, and was armed with a QF 2 pounder (40 mm) tank gun in a three-man turret. The turret <b>traversed</b> by {{hydraulic}} <b>motor</b> or by hand through 360 degrees; the gun could be elevated through an arc from −15 to +20 degrees. One of the most serious weaknesses of the Matilda II was the lack of a high-explosive round for its main gun. A high-explosive shell was designed for the 2 pounder but for reasons never explained, it was not issued and the tank's best weapon against un-armoured targets was its machine gun.|$|R
40|$|Two {{prototype}} traversing boundary-layer pitot probes {{were demonstrated}} in flight. A motor-operated screw-driven type of probe was used on two jet aircraft for defining boundary layers at profile edge Mach numbers from 0. 5 to 2. 2. The {{other type of}} <b>traversing</b> probe was <b>motor</b> driven through a Scotch yoke mechanism and was operated on several flights of the X- 15 airplane. The highest free-stream Mach number reached during this series of flights was 5. 6.

40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comThere is strong evidence that the predominant pathway of the long-latency stretch reflex for flexor pollicis longus crosses the motor cortex. This reflex response is diminished during active thumb movements. We tested the hypothesis that this could be due to a decrease in the excitability of the transcortical component during movement. During isometric, concentric and eccentric thumb movements, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex was given {{at a time when the}} reflex signal was <b>traversing</b> the <b>motor</b> cortex. TMS was also given earlier in separate runs when the signal was traversing the spinal cord under each of the three contractile conditions. The electromyogram was analysed for non-linear summation between stretch responses and the potential evoked by the cortical stimulus. The response to TMS alone was uniform across the three types of contraction, and the lack of cortical involvement in the short-latency reflex was confirmed. The TMS-evoked response summed in a non-linear manner with the long-latency reflex response, confirming that the excitability of the motor cortex was increased as the reflex signal passed through it. The long-latency response was markedly depressed during isotonic compared with isometric contractions. However, the non-linear summation was not greater during the isometric contractions. Thus, the depressed reflex responses during isotonic movements do not stem from reduced motor cortical responsiveness or afferent input to the transcortical pathway, and may instead reflect modulation of cutaneous reflexes during isotonic contractions.

40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comA long-latency stretch reflex (LLSR) has been described in the human masseter muscle, but its pathway remains uncertain. To investigate this, the excitability of corticomotoneuronal (CM) cells projecting to masseter motoneurons during the LLSR was assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). A facilitated response to TMS would be evidence of a LLSR pathway that <b>traverses</b> the <b>motor</b> cortex. Surface electromyogram electrodes were placed over the left or right masseter, and subjects (n= 10) bit on bars with their incisor teeth at 10 % of maximal electromyographic activity (EMG). Servo-controlled displacements were imposed on the lower jaw to evoke a short- and long-latency stretch reflex in masseter. TMS intensity was just suprathreshold for a response in contralateral masseter. Trials consisted of: (1) stretch alone, (2) TMS alone, and (3) TMS with a preceding conditioning stretch at varied conditioning-testing (C-T) intervals chosen to combine TMS with the short-latency stretch reflex (3 ms, 5 ms) and the LLSR (23 – 41 ms). Masseter EMG was rectified and averaged. With TMS alone, mean (± SE) MEP area above baseline was 56 ± 9 %. The area of masseter MEPs above baseline in the C-T trials was calculated from each EMG average following subtraction of the response to stretch alone. Conditioning muscle stretch had no significant effect on masseter MEPs evoked by TMS with any C-T interval (ANOVA; P= 0. 90). In addition, subjects were unable to modify the SLSR or LLSR by voluntary command. It is concluded that the long-latency stretch reflex in the masseter does not involve the motor cortex and is not influenced by "motor set". Sophie L. Pearce, Timothy S. Miles, Philip D. Thompson, Michael A. Nordstro...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Our project {{basically}} {{deals in}} mechatronics, {{which aims to}} integrate mechanical, electrical and biological systems. In this report {{we will look at}} development of an anthropomorphic robotic arm that will mimic actions of a human arm. Search and Rescue vehicle are used for a myriad of tasks in the 21 st century. They are designed to do particular tasks that humans can but will not do, or even things humans cannot do. Our objective is to design and construct a vehicle to be used in an emergency response mission that will be able to venture into terrain and environments that are otherwise too dangerous for human responders. The main function of the Rescue vehicle is to detect survivors using real time video transmission and send robot location via Bluetooth GPS receiver mounted on robot. The video camera will also be connected to PC wirelessly for real time video transmitting. The GPS will also send location data to PC and it will have the location where rescuers are to be sent. The vehicle is manually controlled by an operator and will be driven via looking at real-time video feedback received on PC. The Mechanical Engineering part of this project is to design the actual platform for the robot to travel. Vehicle has 6 wheels, each wheel powered individually by an electric motor similar to many bomb disposal robots, so that it can <b>traverse</b> rough terrain. <b>Motors</b> with appropriate torque and speed have been selected based on weight and performance parameters. Two basic factors have been considered while designing the vehicle, first is vehicle performance and second is cost. We aim to create an affordable robotic arm that is lightweight, easy to use, and performs as similar as possible to a natural arm. Our first task is to detect myoelectric signals from hand movements, process them and convert them to a form suitable as input to...|$|R
