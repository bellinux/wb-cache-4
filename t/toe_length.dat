50|$|Shorter toes: Human toes are {{straight}} and extremely short {{in relation to}} body size compared to other animals. In running, the toes support 50 to 75% of body mass in humans.

The costs of shorter toes are decreased gripping capabilities and power output. However, the efficiency benefits seem to outweigh these costs, as the toes of A. afarensis remains were shorter than great apes, but 40% longer than modern humans, meaning {{that there is a}} trend toward shorter toes as the primate species moves away from tree-dwelling.

5000|$|High {{action is}} prized {{in the saddle}} seat horse. Therefore, many horses used in saddle seat are allowed to grow longer feet than in other {{disciplines}} and are shod with pads and special shoes. While ordinary horseshoes are usually held on with horseshoe nails clinched on the outside wall of the hoof, shoes on high-action breeds are often held in place with a metal band, {{as well as with}} clinches, because of their weight. Longer toes and heavier shoes encourage a saddle seat horse to lift its feet and knees higher, or reach them out farther, with more [...] "snap" [...] and flash. <b>Toe</b> <b>length</b> and shoe weight therefore is an often controversial issue among saddle seat competitors. <b>Toe</b> <b>length</b> and, at times, shoe weight, are often measured at sanctioned shows.

50|$|The spot-bellied eagle-owl {{is a large}} {{species of}} owl. It {{measures}} from 50 to 65 cm in length. It is the sixth longest owl in the world on average and has the ninth longest wings of any living owl. The widely reported weight range for this species 1.3 to 1.5 kg but this is probably towards the low end (possibly from B. n. blighi) or is possibly representative only of smaller males. That body mass range {{is similar to that}} of the larger race of barred eagle-owl, which are in all races considerably smaller going on total length, standard measurements and appearance. One female shot near Haputale in the Badulla District of Sri Lanka, where the owls are smaller than to the north, was found to have weighed 1.7 kg. In this size class, the only similar owl is the barred eagle-owl. Both the barred and spot-bellied eagle-owls are not greatly distinct from other eagle-owls other than their sideways slanting ear-tufts and the degree of feathering on the legs and feet. The ear-tufts of the spot-bellied are very long and conspicuously of variable length, giving them a somewhat scraggly appearance at the tips. The ear-tufts of the spot-bellied eagle-owl measure up to 63 to 76 mm in length. Most eagle-owls are well-feathered on both their leg and toes, while the barred eagle-owl is featherless on the toes and feathered on the legs, and the spot-bellied eagle-owl has feathered legs and feet, but the terminal digits of the toes are bare before the talons. The feet and talons as formidable as any eagle-owl, being very large, heavy and powerful for their size. Among standard measurements, this species typically measures 425 to 477 mm in wing chord length, 230 to 250 mm in tail length, 60 to 62 mm in tarsal length and 52 to 54 mm in culmen length. The subspecies of spot-bellied eagle-owl found on Sri Lanka, B. n. blighi, is linearly about 10% smaller than the birds found further north in India but about the same size as owls from the southern tip of India. B. n. blighi has a wing chord length of 370 to 455 mm, a tail length of 184 to 240 mm, a longer tarsus than northern birds at 63 to 68 mm and a culmen length of 43 to 48 mm. One bird from Sri Lanka had a middle talon of 44.2 mm, a <b>toe</b> <b>length</b> of 50.6 mm and a wingspan of 143 cm. The reported talon length above is very large relative to the size of this owl, the Eurasian eagle-owls found in Spain (Bubo bubo hispanus), although relatively small compared to other Eurasian eagle-owl races, were shown to have smaller talon lengths than the Sri Lankan spot-bellied eagle-owl. Other than size, the only feature that distinguishes northern birds from Sri Lankan birds is that northern birds possess an ill-defined band of honey-brown colour on the pectorals. The spot-bellied eagle-owl is overall a stark, grayish brown bird, with dark, coarse brown coloration over the back and upper wings. The throat and underparts are mainly pale fulvous in color with black and white horizontal stripes along the flanks of the body that become broad spots on the abdomen and under tail coverts. On the wings, the primaries are dark brown with lighter brown stripes and the secondaries are more heavily barred with buff-brown coloration. The lores are covered in bristly feathers and the cheeks are brownish-white with black feather shafts. The large ear tufts slant off to the sides. Juveniles birds are distinct from adult birds, being a much paler grayish-cream overall with fairly heavy brownish barring. Distinguishing the spot-bellied eagle-owl is relatively straightforward, since other Indian and southeast Asian eagle owls do not generally dwell in deep forests as does this species. The spot-bellied is the largest of the owls in its range other than the tawny fish owl (Bubo flavipes), which is restricted in both habitat and diet to mountain streams. The subspecies of Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo hemachalana) found in the Himalayas may inhabit higher elevations of the same mountains where the spot-bellied eagle-owl dwells in the lower elevations in the forested foothills but there their ranges barely abut. The Indian eagle-owl (Bubo bengalensis) (typically found in wooded vicinities of rocky areas) is around 10% smaller than the spot-bellied, the dusky eagle-owl (Bubo coromandus) (typically found in woods near wetlands) is around 15% smaller and the brown wood owl, the largest Strix found in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, is around 35% smaller. Furthermore, the coloring of the spot-bellied eagle-owl is distinctive from all but the barred eagle-owl, which it does not co-exist within the wild.|$|E

40|$|Lameness is a multi-factorial {{condition}} {{that depends on}} managerial as well as genetic variables, but often is related to legs and feet condition of the animals. The aim {{of the study was}} to give an overview of legs and claws condition and the presence of lameness in sows at one industrial farm. Total 130 animals (90 dry i. e. pregnant and 40 lactating sows) were observed. The occurrence of leg joints swellings, than claws condition (<b>toes</b> <b>length,</b> dew claw condition, cracked wall) and lameness (in animals in group boxes) were visually recorded and then classified according to the appropriate protocols. Findings proved the occurrence of one or more of examined conditions in 40 % of pregnant sows and in 45 % sows in lactation. In more than 20 % of pregnant sows lameness was presented. There was statistically significant positive correlation between the occurrence of lameness and leg swellings and between lameness and claw condition in pregnant sows (in both cases p< 0. 0001). The results show that lameness is a significant problem in the studied farm. In general, more attention should be given to monitoring of sows' physical condition and behaviour, to minimize the occurrence of welfare problems and to reduce production losses...|$|R

40|$|Four slides, the Ana, Joan, Nuna and Jersi slides, {{have been}} imaged on the {{seafloor}} along the Balearic {{margin of the}} Eivissa Channel in the western Mediterranean. They have areas of up to 16 km 2 and occur in water depths ranging between 600 and 900 m. Volumes range from 0 Æ 14 to 0 Æ 4 km 3. Their headwall scarps, internal architecture and associated deposits are characterized {{using a combination of}} swath bathymetry data and very high-resolution seismic reflection profiles. In general, they show horseshoe-shaped headwall scarps and distinct depositional lobes with positive relief. Internally, the slide bodies are mostly composed of transparent seismic facies. Chaotic facies are observed at the toe of some of the slides, and blocks of coherent stratified facies embedded in the slide deposit have also been identified. The reflection profiles demonstrate that the four slides share the same slip horizon, which corresponds to a distinctive continuous, high-amplitude reflector. Furthermore, the geometry of the headwall scars of the Nuna and Ana slides reveals evidence of pockmarks, and fluid escape features are also present further upslope. This indicates a possible link between fluid escape features and destabilization of the upper sediment layers. In addition, these well-characterized slides demonstrate the pitfalls associated with calculating the volume of the slide masses using headwall scarp heights and the assumed preslide seafloor topography in the absence of seismic data. The internal structure also demonstrates that transport distances within the slides are generally low and poorly characterized by headwall scarp to slide <b>toe</b> <b>lengths...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{quantified}} {{the extent}} of adaptive radiation {{in the evolution of}} the hindlimb in the bird-of-prey community on Tasmania. Assessments of the ecological capabilities of raptor species are often based on a visual inspection of their hindlimb structure, with little recourse to direct biomechanical or functional evidence. We examined the links between hindlimb structure and patterns of diet, foraging, and habitat use in raptors by analytically investigating tarsus, toe, and talon measurements. We identified groupings on the basis of dietary preference, hunting-killing technique, and phylogeny. We found that the bird-catching specialists, which possessed relatively long digits with short talons, were consistently separable. The large-mammal and fish specialists were equipped with relatively short and robust tarsi, and short digits with long and robust talons. The hindlimbs of medium-mammal specialists were characterized by long digits and a large digit 1 talon. However, the generalist group did not possess any specializations, because their structural elements were comparable to those of other dietary groups. An association was found between the ratio of <b>toe</b> to talon <b>length</b> and the selective pressures of prey capture and ease of killing. Morphological variation in this feature was consistent with phylogeny, because the Accipitridae were characterized by a larger ratio of <b>toe</b> to talon <b>length</b> on digits 1 and 2 than the Falconidae, and the diurnal raptors possessed an interdigital pattern of larger variation in ratio of <b>toe</b> to talon <b>length</b> than the nocturnal raptors. No link was found between dietary habit and tarsus length or robustness, because these features were apparently attributed to variations in hunting style.

40|$|Morphological {{asymmetry}} {{has been}} described as a potential broiler welfare indicator, for interpreting the birds' ability to cope with the challenges that may affect its growth. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of morphological asymmetry data to estimate broiler walking ability and welfare. dBroilers werefed diets supplemented or not with vitamin D. Toes were measured when birds were 42 and 49 days old using digital caliper. the left and right sides of the following four bilateral traits (tarsometatarsus length, outer <b>toe</b> <b>length,</b> mid <b>toe</b> <b>length,</b> and back <b>toe</b> <b>length)</b> were measured twice on intact alive birds by two different researcherh.

40|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{in birds}} may be expressed as differences in body size, plumage, color and/or behavior. Many species are monomorphic in color, making sex determination {{difficult in the}} field. An example of the latter are mockingbirds, which are passerines of the genus Mimus, endemic to the Americas. In order to distinguish {{between male and female}} mockingbirds using external body measurements that are easy to take, the objective of this work was to quantify morphometric differences between sexes in adults of the following species: M. thenca (45 specimens), M. patagonicus (95), M. saturninus (88), M. triurus (152), and M. dorsalis (7). We measured the following variables: culmen length, bill height and width, tarsus length, middle <b>toe</b> <b>length,</b> wing chord and tail length. Measurements were generally larger in males than in females except for bill width in M. saturninus and M. triurus, culmen length in M. thenca and M. dorsalis, and bill height in M. dorsalis.

40|$|Puma concolor: Is it {{possible}} to differentiate the sexes using measurements from captive animals? Zoological Studies 49 (4) : 577 - 582. Studies of felines have attempted to identify individuals by their tracks, since this ability would allow obtaining data such as the presence/absence and abundance of these species, which are difficult to obtain because of their secretive habits. Distinguishing between the sexes is important, because it permits estimation of the sex ratio and the relation of this to population dynamics; however, few studies have attempted to determine the sex of Puma concolor using tracks. This study uses linear, angular, area, and geometric morphometrics to correctly classify individuals by sex using tracks from captive animals. The results indicated that males had greater mean values for many variables, except for the area of internal toe, the area of exterior <b>toe,</b> the <b>length</b> of 3 rd <b>toe</b> and the <b>length</b> of the 2 nd toe.

This study also focuses on the diagnosis of flatfoot among the studied population. Data has been collected from 160 participants (80 boys and 80 girls) from Bengali Hindu caste population aged 3 to 6 years. Anthropometric measurements included height, weight and body mass index. Other measurements on foot morphology included foot length, foot breadth diagonal, foot breadth horizontal, ball of the foot length, outside ball of the boot length, heel breadth, and <b>toe</b> <b>lengths</b> T 1, T 2, T 3. T 4, T 5. Staheli’s Plantar Arch Index, Chippaux-Smirak Index and foot angle were calculated. Various statistical tests like t-test, Pearson’s correlation and ANOVA were performed. Among all the variables, foot breadth horizontal showed statistically significant difference {{between boys and girls}} (p< 0. 05). All the footprint dimensions showed a significant (p< 0. 05) positive correlation with height and weight in both the boys and the girls. However, the Staheli’s Plantar Arch Index showed a significant (p< 0. 05) negative correlation with height and weight and Chippaux-Smirak Index showed a significant (p< 0. 05) negative correlation with height only among both the boys and the girls. Significant differences (ANOVA) were found between the foot morphology of children in three different weight categories (underweight, healthy and overweight) except the foot angle, and both indices. The present study evinces that weight affects the foot structure of the children. The prevalence of flatfoot was found to be 57. 5 % among the children with no significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the boys and the girls. The results thus provide a podium for intricate studies in the future. Timely prognosis of flatfoot in children can instigate early rectification of flat-footedness...|$|R

For all four of these measures, Liao’s modified concordance correlation coefficient (mCCC) was ≤ 0. 4, indicating poor concordance despite Pearson’s correlation being > 0. 6 in all cases. The worst concordance was seen for <b>toe</b> <b>length</b> (mCCC = 0. 13). Limits-of-agreement analysis showed that, for all four measures, there was a large variation in the difference between the manual and digital methods, even when the effect of mean on difference was accounted for, with the 95 % limits-of-agreement for the four measures being further away from the mean difference than 10 % of the mean in all four cases. The only one of the five measures with an acceptable concordance between digital and manual measurement was toe angle (mCCC = 0. 81). Nevertheless, the limits-of-agreement analysis showed that there was a systematic bias with, on average, the manual measure of toe angle, being 2. 1 ° smaller than the digital. The 95 % limits-of-agreement for toe angle were ± 3. 4 °, probably at the upper limit of what is acceptable.

B) Scores {{of the first}} two principal components derived from the non-transformed morphometric data (31 variables, 82 specimens) from the five localities (color key as in figure 1) corresponding to phylogroups TUR (triangles) and GAT (circles). Gray arrows represent variable loadings for both axes (overlapping names were excluded, see Appendix V for a full numerical description of components); the inset shows the variance explained by the first five PCs, highlighting in black those displayed in the plot...|$|E
50|$|Chaffee died on July 31, 1903 and Chamberlain (now 81 years old) {{received}} word via the mail. In October 16, 1903, Jason’s lifelong diary ends - he {{shot himself in}} the head with a shotgun on his front porch, tying the trigger to his <b>toe</b> with a <b>length</b> of string. According to their neighbor, they had planned to be buried side by side, though this was not carried out. Jason was buried at Divide Cemetery, Groveland and John buried in Oakland.|$|R
60|$|During this memorable evening, Middlemas and Hartley, who {{had found}} {{room in the}} music gallery, {{witnessed}} the scene, and, as it would seem, with very different feelings. Hartley was evidently annoyed by the excess of attention which the gallant Laird of Louponheight, stimulated by {{the influence of a}} couple of bottles of claret, and by the presence of a partner who danced remarkably well, paid to Miss Menie Gray. He saw from his lofty stand all the dumb show of gallantry, with the comfortable feelings of a famishing creature looking upon a feast which he is not permitted to share, and regarded every extraordinary frisk of the jovial Laird, as the same might have been looked upon by a gouty person, who apprehended that the dignitary was about to descend on his <b>toes.</b> At <b>length,</b> unable to restrain his emotion, he left the gallery and returned no more.|$|R
50|$|The feet have <b>toes</b> of unequal <b>length</b> with {{tips that}} form a {{strongly}} curved line when held together. The claws are short and curved, but strong, being adapted for climbing and running rather than digging. The pads {{of the feet}} are hairless, but are surrounded by stiff sensory hairs. The head has small, rounded, ears, long whiskers and black eyes with a blue-green shine. Like most other mustelids, tayras possess anal scent glands, {{but these are not}} particularly large, and their secretion is not as pungent as in other species, and is not used in self-defence.|$|R
