25|$|Multipotent {{stem cells}} are also found in amniotic fluid. These {{stem cells are}} very active, expand {{extensively}} without feeders and are not <b>tumorigenic.</b> Amniotic stem cells are multipotent and can differentiate in cells of adipogenic, osteogenic, myogenic, endothelial, hepatic and also neuronal lines.|$|E
25|$|While {{this method}} of {{modeling}} human cancer in cell culture is effective and {{has been used for}} many years by scientists, it is also very imprecise. The exact changes that allow for the formation of the <b>tumorigenic</b> clones in the above-described experiment are not clear. Scientists addressed this question by the serial introduction of multiple mutations present in a variety of human cancers. This has led to the identification of mutation combinations that form <b>tumorigenic</b> cells in a variety of cell types. While the combination varies by cell type, the following alterations are required in all cases: TERT activation, loss of p53 pathway function, loss of pRb pathway function, activation of the Ras or myc proto-oncogenes, and aberration of the PP2A protein phosphatase. That is to say, the cell has an activated telomerase, eliminating the process of death by chromosome instability or loss, absence of apoptosis-induction pathways, and continued mitosis activation.|$|E
25|$|CSCs {{have been}} {{reported}} in many brain tumors. Stem-like tumor cells have been identified using cell surface markers including CD133, SSEA-1 (stage-specific embryonic antigen-1), EGFR and CD44. The use of CD133 for identification of brain tumor stem-like cells may be problematic because <b>tumorigenic</b> cells are found in both CD133+ and CD133− cells in some gliomas and some CD133+ brain tumor cells may not possess tumor-initiating capacity.|$|E
25|$|Tumor cells {{undergoing}} an EMT may be {{precursors for}} metastatic cancer cells, or even metastatic CSCs. In the invasive edge of pancreatic carcinoma, {{a subset of}} CD133+CXCR4+ (receptor for CXCL12 chemokine {{also known as a}} SDF1 ligand) cells was defined. These cells exhibited significantly stronger migratory activity than their counterpart CD133+CXCR4− cells, but both showed similar tumor development capacity. Moreover, inhibition of the CXCR4 receptor reduced metastatic potential without altering <b>tumorigenic</b> capacity.|$|E
25|$|Since iPSCs {{can only}} be {{produced}} with high efficiency at this time using modifications, they are generally predicted to be less safe and more <b>tumorigenic</b> than hESC. All the genes that {{have been shown to}} promote iPSC formation have also been linked to cancer in one way or another. Some of the genes are known oncogenes, including the members of the Myc family. While omitting Myc allows for IPSC formation, the efficiency is reduced up to 100 fold.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} area for future {{studies in the}} iPSC field is directly testing iPSC tumorigenicity using methods that mimic the approaches {{that would be used}} for regenerative medicine therapies. Such studies are crucial since iPSCs not only form teratoma, but also mice derived from iPSCs have a high incidence of death from malignant cancer. A 2010 paper was published in the journal Stem Cells indicating that iPS cells are far more <b>tumorigenic</b> than ESC, supporting the notion that iPS cell safety is a serious concern.|$|E
25|$|The best {{understood}} galectin {{in terms of}} cancer is galectin-3. Evidence suggests that galectin-3 plays a considerable part in processes linked to tumorigenesis, including transformation to a malignant form, metastasis and increased invasive properties of tumour cells. There is some significant evidence that galectin-3 is involved in cancer since it interacts with oncogenes such as Ras and activates downstream signalling that promotes proliferation. It can also regulate some of the proteins of the cell cycle, such as cyclin E and c-myc, which may give it additional <b>tumorigenic</b> properties.|$|E
25|$|Cancer {{stem cells}} (CSCs) are cancer cells (found within tumors or {{hematological}} cancers) that possess characteristics associated with normal stem cells, specifically {{the ability to}} give rise to all cell types found in a particular cancer sample. CSCs are therefore <b>tumorigenic</b> (tumor-forming), perhaps in contrast to other non-tumorigenic cancer cells. CSCs may generate tumors through the stem cell processes of self-renewal and differentiation into multiple cell types. Such cells are hypothesized to persist in tumors as a distinct population and cause relapse and metastasis by giving rise to new tumors. Therefore, development of specific therapies targeted at CSCs holds hope for improvement of survival {{and quality of life}} of cancer patients, especially for patients with metastatic disease.|$|E
25|$|MPyV is {{primarily}} spread among mice via the intranasal route and is shed in urine. Genetic susceptibility to MPyV infection among mice varies significantly, {{and not all}} MPyV strains are oncogenic. In general, only newborns and immunosuppressed mice (usually transgenic) develop tumors upon infection; although originally observed {{as a cause of}} parotid gland tumors, the virus may induce solid tumors {{in a wide variety of}} tissue types of both epithelial and mesenchymal origin. Although viruses in circulation among feral mice can be <b>tumorigenic,</b> under natural conditions the virus does not cause tumors; maternal antibodies have been shown to be critical in protecting neonates. It has been described as rare in modern laboratory mouse research colonies.|$|E
25|$|P16 {{interacts with}} Rb and {{controls}} the G1 to S transition. It binds to CDK4/6 inhibiting its kinase activity and prevents Rb phosphorylation. Therefore, Rb remains associated with transcription factor E2F1, preventing transcription of E2F1 target genes which are {{crucial for the}} G1/S transition. During this process, a feedback loop exists between P16 and Rb, and P16 expression is controlled by Rb. P16/Rb pathway collaborates with the mitogenic signaling cascade for the induction of reactive oxygen species, which activates the protein kinase C delta, leading to an irreversible cell cycle arrest. Thus P16 participates {{not only in the}} initiation but also in the maintenance of cellular senescence, as well in tumor suppression. On the other hand, some specific tumors harbor high levels of P16, and its function in limitation of <b>tumorigenic</b> progression has been inactivated via the loss of Rb.|$|E
500|$|There is {{recent and}} growing {{interest}} in fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. The molecular basis for this rare form of liver cancer that afflicts young adults is a genetic deletion on chromosome 19. The loss of DNA {{has been found in}} a very high percent of patients. [...] The consequence of this deletion is the abnormal fusion of two genes- DNAJB1, which is the gene that codes for the heat shock protein 40, and PRKACA. Further analyses of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma tissues show an increase in protein levels of this DNAJ-PKAc fusion protein. This is consistent with the hypothesis that increased kinase in liver tissues can initiate or perpetuate this rare form of liver cancer. Given the wealth of information on the three dimensional structures of DNAJ and PKA Cα there is some hope that new drugs can be developed to target this atypical and potentially <b>tumorigenic</b> fusion kinase.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order for}} a cell to become {{cancerous}} it must undergo {{a significant number of}} alterations to its DNA sequence. This cell model suggests these mutations could occur to any cell in the body resulting in a cancer. Essentially this theory proposes that all cells have the ability to be <b>tumorigenic</b> making all tumor cells equipotent with the ability to self-renew or differentiate, leading to tumor heterogeneity while others can differentiate into non-CSCs [...] The cell's potential can be influenced by unpredicted genetic or epigenetic factors, resulting in phenotypically diverse cells in both the <b>tumorigenic</b> and non-tumorigenic cells that compose the tumor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{activation}} of the H19 promoter in cancerous cells (and its silence in normal tissues) {{has led to the}} suggestion of using the H19 promoter in gene therapy to drive the expression of cytotoxic genes in <b>tumorigenic</b> cells.|$|E
2500|$|... miR-122 {{levels are}} {{frequently}} reduced in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to normal liver, and low miR-122 levels correlate with poor prognosis. Overexpression of miR-122 reduces <b>tumorigenic</b> properties in HCC cell lines, {{suggesting that it}} functions as a tumor suppressor gene, and increases the response of cells to the chemotherapeutic drugs sorafenib and doxorubicin. Several miR-122 target genes have been implicated in tumorigenesis, including ADAM10, IGF1R, CCNG1 and ADAM17.|$|E
2500|$|The cancer {{stem cell}} model, {{also known as the}} Hierarchical Model proposes that tumors are hierarchically {{organized}} (CSCs lying at the apex (Fig. 3).) Within the cancer population of the tumors there are {{cancer stem cell}}s (CSC) that are <b>tumorigenic</b> cells and are biologically distinct from other subpopulations They have two defining features: their long-term ability to self-renew and their capacity to differentiate into progeny that is non-tumorigenic but still contributes to the growth of the tumor. [...] This model suggests that only certain subpopulations of cancer stem cells have the ability to drive the progression of cancer, meaning that there are specific (intrinsic) characteristics that can be identified and then targeted to destroy a tumor long-term without the need to battle the whole tumor.|$|E
