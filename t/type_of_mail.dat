25|$|The Imperial edict of 12 Ramasan 1256 {{and later}} {{ordinances}} made {{the distinction between}} three types of mail items: ordinary letters, registered letters (markings te'ahudd olunmoshdur), and official letters (markings tahirat-i mühümme). Fees were calculated by the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail,</b> the weight, and the distance (measured in hours): in 1840, an ordinary letter, weighing less than 10g, had a cost per hour of 1 para. Special fees applied to samples, insured mail, special delivery, and printed matters, etc. These postal rates changed frequently, and new services were added over the years. Upon joining the Universal Postal Union on 1 July 1875, Ottoman overseas rates conformed to UPU rules.|$|E
25|$|Hybrid mail, {{sometimes}} referred to as L-mail, is the electronic lodgement of mail from the mail generator’s computer directly to a Postal Service provider. The Postal Service provider is then able to use electronic means to have the mail piece sorted, routed and physically produced at a site closest to the delivery point. It is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> growing in popularity with some Post Office operations and individual businesses venturing into this market. In some countries, these services are available to print and deliver emails to those who are unable to receive email, such as the elderly or infirm. Services provided by Hybrid mail providers are closely related to that of mail forwarding service providers.|$|E
25|$|Lorica hamata was a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> armour {{used during}} the Roman Republic {{continuing}} throughout the Roman Empire as a standard-issue armour for the primary heavy infantry legionaries and secondary troops (auxilia). They were mostly manufactured out of iron, though sometimes bronze was used instead. The rings were linked together, alternating closed washer-like rings with riveted rings. This produced a very flexible, reliable and strong armour. Each ring had an inside diameter of between 5 and 7mm, and an outside diameter of 7 to 9mm. The shoulders of the lorica hamata had flaps that {{were similar to those}} of the Greek linothorax; they ran from about mid-back to the front of the torso, and were connected by brass or iron hooks which connected to studs riveted through the ends of the flaps. Several thousand rings would have gone into one lorica hamata.|$|E

2500|$|Airmail stamp — {{for payment}} of airmail service. The term [...] "airmail" [...] or an {{equivalent}} is usually printed on special airmail stamps. Airmail stamps typically depict images of airplanes and/or famous pilots and were used when airmail {{was a special}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> delivery separate from mail delivered by train, ship or automobile. Aside from mail with local destinations, today almost all other mail is transported by aircraft and thus airmail is now the standard method of delivery. Scott has a separate category and listing for U.S. Airmail Postage. Prior to 1940, Scotts Catalogue {{did not have a}} special designation for airmail stamps. The various major stamp catalogs have different numbering systems and may not always list airmail stamps the same way.|$|E

50|$|Historically, postal {{censorship}} {{is an ancient}} practice; it is usually linked to espionage and intelligence gathering. Both civilian mail and military mail {{may be subject to}} censorship, and often different organisations perform censorship <b>of</b> these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail.</b> In 20th-century wars the objectives of {{postal censorship}} encompassed economic warfare, security and intelligence.|$|R

5000|$|Graymail is {{solicited}} bulk email {{messages that}} don't fit {{the definition of}} email spam (e.g., the recipient [...] "opted into" [...] receiving them). Recipient interest in this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>mailing</b> tends to diminish over time, increasing the likelihood that recipients will report graymail as spam. In some cases, graymail can account for up to 82 percent of the average user's email inbox.|$|R
5000|$|The bubbles {{that provide}} the {{cushioning}} for fragile or sensitive objects are generally available in different sizes, {{depending on the size}} of the object being packed, as well as the level of cushioning protection that is needed. Multiple layers might be needed to provide shock and vibration isolation. A single layer might be used just as a surface protective layer. Bubble wrap is used to form some <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>mailing</b> envelopes.|$|R

50|$|The USPS, {{successor}} to the U.S. Post Office, officially ended International Parcel Post service in May 2007 after some 120 years of existence. International Parcel Post service was replaced by First-class Mail International service for parcels up to four pounds. For heavier parcels and/or printed matter, Priority Mail International, Priority Mail International Flat-Rate, Express Mail International, Airmail M-Bags, and Global Express Guaranteed service is available to foreign countries allowing these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> delivery.|$|R
5000|$|At {{least two}} <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>mailing</b> lists can be defined: an {{announcement}} list {{is closer to}} the original sense, where a [...] "mailing list" [...] of people was used as a recipient for newsletters, periodicals or advertising. Traditionally this was done through the postal system, but with the rise of email, the electronic mailing list became popular. The second type allows members to post their own items which are broadcast to all <b>of</b> the other <b>mailing</b> list members. This second category is usually known as a discussion list.|$|R
50|$|From the 1913 to 1930, Commonwealth and State Government {{agencies}} used stamps (perfins) punctured with OS (“Official Service”). In 1931 the puncturing {{system was}} abandoned and stamps for government mail were overprinted OS. In February 1933, {{it was decided}} that government mail would no longer require postage stamps. The exception to OS stamps being restricted for the use of government agencies was the 4 November 1931 6d airmail stamp. The OS overprinted stamp was sold over post office counters to prevent speculation and was valid for all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Courtesy reply mail, or CRM, is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> {{in which}} a {{business}} sends pre-printed, self-addressed envelopes or postcards to customers, who then affix postage stamps to the envelopes or postcards and mail {{them back to the}} business. [...] Alternatively, the business can disseminate the envelopes or postcards with stamps already affixed, similarly to metered reply mail.|$|E

Before that British and Spanish stamps were used {{according to the}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> and other arrangaments were in place before the invention of postage stamps. British stamps used in Gibraltar may be identified {{by the use of}} cancels containing the numeral A26 or the letter G in oval bars.|$|E
50|$|Some {{countries}} have different coloured post boxes; {{in countries such}} as Australia, Portugal, and Russia, the colour indicates which <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> a box is to be used for, such as 1st and 2nd class post. However, in Germany and parts of Sweden, because of postal deregulation, the different colours are for the different postal services. Other nations use a particular colour to indicate common political or historical ties.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the contribution <b>of</b> direct <b>mail</b> advertising to average weekly unit sales of a national fast food franchisee. Two different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> direct <b>mail</b> advertising are used, both independently and in conjunction with local and national advertising. Results of a field study indicate that one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> direct <b>mail</b> (a shopper) contributes significantly to sales when used independently. When combined with national or local advertising, however, the contribution level of this shopper decreases. Conversely, a direct mail insert combined with many others inserts into one single envelope is much more powerful when utilized in conjunction with national advertising. In fact, results show that this latter combination <b>of</b> direct <b>mail</b> with national advertising contributes more to average weekly unit sales than any other combination. Implications are offered and future research is suggested. ...|$|R
50|$|The three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> {{carriers}} are also hired quite differently. A new letter carrier {{begins as a}} City Carrier Assistant (CCA.) Rural {{carriers are}} hired as Rural Carrier Associate (RCA) carriers, without benefits. There is normally an RCA assigned to each rural route, so they usually work less frequently than city CCAs. As a result, {{there are thousands of}} RCA positions that go unfilled {{due to a lack of}} applicants, and are being covered by other RCA's until hiring improves for the hiring process explained). Highway Contract Route carriers are hired by the winning bidder for that route. They are not United States Postal Service employees, and normally receive lower pay than carriers on city or rural routes.|$|R
50|$|A crash {{cover is}} a philatelic {{term for a}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> cover, (including the terms air {{accident}} cover, interrupted flight cover, wreck cover) meaning an envelope or package that has been recovered from a fixed-wing aircraft, airship or aeroplane crash, train wreck, shipwreck or other accident.

5000|$|Mail jumping is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> delivery. The person {{doing the}} mail jumping (known as a mail jumper) is transported on {{a body of}} water by a boat. The person jumps off the boat onto a dock, places {{incoming}} mail in a mailbox, retrieves outgoing mail, and jumps back onto the boat. [...] The boat continues to move at a slow and steady pace (about 5 mph) while the mail jumper is jumping.|$|E
50|$|The hauberk is {{typically}} a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> armour which is constructed of interlocking loops of metal woven into a tunic or shirt. The sleeves sometimes only {{went to the}} elbow, but often were full arm length, with some covering the hands with a supple glove leather face on the palm of the hand, or even full mail gloves. It was usually thigh or knee length, with a split {{in the front and}} back to the groin so the wearer could ride a horse. It sometimes incorporated a hood, or coif.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} use <b>of</b> electronic <b>mail</b> and {{the great}} diversity of materials that are sent via electronic mail has resulted in people having problems managing the volume <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> and identifying important messages in their mailboxes. Until recently, electronic <b>mail</b> consisted <b>of</b> plain text.

5000|$|Laddie was {{designed}} to resemble a real dog. The catalog Bart uses {{is a combination of}} the Lillian Vernon catalog and The Sharper Image. The opening stemmed {{from the fact that the}} show had not had a sequence where the family received mail, and the writers wanted to create a joke about the different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> each <b>of</b> the family get. After Bart's [...] "dog burning" [...] fantasy, when he hears a ship's horn in the distance, there was originally going to be a faint cry of [...] "more dogs", but it was deemed that it took the joke too far.
