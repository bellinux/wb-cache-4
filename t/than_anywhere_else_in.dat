Indeed, {{there is a greater}} density of Roman marching camps in Scotland <b>than</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> Europe, as a result of at least four major attempts to subdue the area. The Antonine Wall was occupied again for a brief period after 197. The most notable invasion was in 209 when the emperor Septimius Severus, claiming to be provoked by the belligerence of the Maeatae, campaigned against the Caledonian Confederacy. Severus invaded Caledonia with an army perhaps over 40,000 strong.|$|E

The Gukhak, or national academy, was established here in 682, {{at the beginning}} of the Unified Silla period. Its curriculum focused on the Confucian classics for local officials. After the fall of Silla in the 10th century, the Gukhak closed. However, due to Gyeongju's role as a provincial center under the Goryeo and early Joseon dynasties, the city was home to state-sponsored provincial schools (hyanggyo) under both dynasties such as Gyeongju Hyanggyo. During the later Joseon dynasty there were several seowon, or private Confucian academies, were set up in the city such as Oksan Seowon and Seoak Seowon.|$|E

5|$|Overlapping the {{military}} chain of command, {{there was a}} plenipotentiary of the Foreign Office, Felix Benzler, reporting to the Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, and for economic affairs, a representative of Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, Franz Neuhausen. These power structures competed with each other, {{to a greater extent}} <b>than</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> occupied Europe. Meyszner's appointment further complicated an already complex situation, as prior to this decision, Turner had been responsible for police and security matters. Meyszner had to formally acknowledge Bader as his superior but received his orders from Hitler and Himmler. One of his priorities was to improve coordination of policies towards the Volksdeutsche (or Germans of Yugoslavia), concentrated in the Banat region, as the decision had been made in late 1941 to subject them to conscription in order to raise a Waffen-SS division. This decision, approved by Hitler a few days before Meyszner's appointment, had strengthened Himmler's case for a HSSPF in Belgrade.|$|E

5|$|In September 1183, {{construction}} of the Cairo Citadel began under Saladin's orders. According to al-Maqrizi, Saladin chose the Muqattam Hills to build the citadel because the air there was fresher <b>than</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the city, but its construction {{was not so much}} determined by the salubrious atmosphere; rather it was out of defensive necessity and example of existing fortresses and citadels in Syria. The walls and towers of the northern section of the citadel are largely the works of Saladin and al-Kamil. Two of Saladin's towers were totally encased by semi-circular units. Al-Kamil completed the citadel; he strengthened and enlarged some of the existing towers, and also added a number of square towers which served as self-contained keeps. According to Richard Yeomans, the most impressive of al-Kamil's structures was the series of massive rectangular keeps which straddled the walls of the northern enclosure. All of al-Kamil's fortifications can be identified by their embossed, rusticated masonry, whereas Saladin's towers have smooth dressed stones. This heavier rustic style became a common feature in other Ayyubid fortifications, and {{can be seen in the}} Citadel of Damascus and that of Bosra in Syria.|$|E

Asian Americans also constitute a majority in Fremont, with significant populations in Sunnyvale and Santa Clara. The cities of San Jose and San Francisco had {{the third and fourth}} largest total number of Asian Americans out of every American city. In San Francisco, Chinese Americans constitute 21.4% of the population and constitute the single largest ethnic group in the city. Santa Clara county, and increasingly the East Bay, house a significant Indian American community. The Bay Area is home to over 382,950 Filipino Americans, one of the largest communities of Filipino people outside of the Philippines with the largest proportion of Filipino Americans concentrating themselves within American Canyon, Daly City, Fairfield, South San Francisco and Vallejo.
