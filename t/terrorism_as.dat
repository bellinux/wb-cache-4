25|$|The OLF {{states that}} the {{protracted}} armed resistance {{under the leadership of}} the Front is an act of self-defense exercised by the Front against successive Ethiopian governments, including the current one, which OLF believes is forcibly denying the Oromo people their right to self-determination. So the OLF armed resistance hopes to target the government's coercive machinery, not innocent civilians. The OLF has an anti terrorism stand and opposes <b>terrorism</b> <b>as</b> means of struggle to achieve the right of the Oromo people. The Organization considers <b>terrorism</b> <b>as</b> act of desperation. So it has a clear and peaceful policy on its actions against civilians in Ethiopia. Therefore, anti-terrorism against civilians remains a core policy of the organization even though OLF has not made a clear distinction between its armed struggle and terrorism acts against current and future Ethiopian governments.|$|E

25|$|There are {{multiple}} ways of defining terrorism {{and all are}} subjective. Most define <b>terrorism</b> <b>as</b> 'the use or threat of serious violence' to advance some kind of 'cause'.

Bishop's mother filed, then dropped, a lawsuit claiming that an acne medicine Bishop took, isotretinoin, had side effects such as depression and suicidal actions, and caused the incident.|$|E
25|$|Neoconservatives and the Bush Doctrine {{held that}} the hatred for the West and United States in {{particular}} does not exist because of actions perpetrated by the United States, but rather because the countries from which terrorists emerge are in social disarray and do not experience the freedom that is an intrinsic part of democracy. The Bush Doctrine holds that enemies of United States are using <b>terrorism</b> <b>as</b> a war of ideology against the United States. The responsibility of the United States is to protect itself and its friends by promoting democracy where the terrorists are located so as to undermine the basis for terrorist activities.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Bakunin began warning {{friends about}} Nechayev's behavior, and broke off all {{relations}} with Nechayev. Others note, moreover, that Bakunin never sought to take personal {{control of the}} International, that his secret organisations were not subject to his autocratic power, and that he condemned <b>terrorism</b> <b>as</b> counter-revolutionary. Robert M. Cutler goes further, pointing {{out that it is}} impossible fully to understand either Bakunin's participation in the League of Peace and Freedom or the International Alliance of Socialist Democracy, or his idea of a secret revolutionary organisation that is immanent in the people, without seeing that they derive from his interpretation of Hegel's dialectic from the 1840s. The script of Bakunin's dialectic, Cutler argues, gave the Alliance the purpose of providing the International with a real revolutionary organisation.|$|E
