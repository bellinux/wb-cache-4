40|$|Simple {{inspection}} and measurement technique makes possible to estimate wear of balls in ball bearing, without removing bearing from shaft on which installed. To perform measurement, one observes bearing cage while <b>turning</b> <b>shaft</b> by hand to obtain integral number of cage rotations and to measure, to nearest 2 degrees, number of shaft rotations producing cage rotations. Ratio between numbers of cages and shaft rotations depends only on internal geometry of bearing and applied load. Changes in turns ratio reflect changes in internal geometry of bearing provided measurements made with similar bearing loads. By assuming all wear occurs on balls, one computes effective value for this wear from change in turns ratio...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a new concept}} of a {{technical}} muscle is presented. The proposed muscle is based on standard components and is scalable in many respects: size, weight, power, speed, price, and quality. It is composed of a <b>turning</b> <b>shaft</b> with small diameter and a high-strength and highly flexible plaited cord. The shaft may be driven by a small DC-motor, possibly in combination with a gearbox. This makes design, power supply, and control quite easy compared to other types of artificial muscles such as pneumatic, hydraulic, shape memory alloy, and electro-active polymer muscles. With appropriate measures in design {{it will be able}} to meet various application requirements such as wide temperature range and high IP rating. Moreover, with careful selection and dimensioning of components a very high degree of efficiency, a very high power to weight ratio, and high dependability may be achieved. The muscle is applicable as an actuating drive in industrial environments as well as for bionic robot mechanisms with biomimetic and undulatory motion. The name DOHELIX is an acronym for "double helix", a shape resulting from contraction of the muscle...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Windmill, {{machine that}} {{converts}} wind into useful energy. This energy {{is derived from}} the force of wind acting on oblique blades or sails that radiate from a shaft. The <b>turning</b> <b>shaft</b> may be connected to machinery used to generate electricity. The present paper makes an attempt to show the effect of wind and earthquake load on tubular type windmill and its foundation considering hard, medium and soft soil strata. The modeling of windmill tower was done in computer software by finite element modeling technique. In that windmill tower was subjected to wind and earthquake forces and check bending stresses, mode Shape, base shear comparison, stability, safety of windmill for hard, medium and soft strata. Also check stability, safety of windmill foundation and design of reinforcement required in the foundation for hard, medium and soft strata. Based on the analytical investigation and design it has been concluded that the effect of wind on windmill is significant as compare to earthquake, hence stability of windmill is thoroughly check for this load. Soil strata also {{play a major role in}} deciding its safety and stability. The normalized base shear, seismic moments, natural time period, bending stresses in tower and sizes and reinforcement of foundation increases from hard strata to soft strata...|$|E

50|$|The Dunkeld Lectern is a mediaeval lectern {{which was}} one of the most prized {{possessions}} of St Stephen's Church, St Albans. The 150 kg brass reading desk stood approximately 1.6 metres high and took the form of a large eagle with outspread wings with the bird perched on an orb supported by a <b>turned</b> <b>shaft</b> - an eagle lectern. Engraved on the orb was a Latin inscription - Georgius Creichton Episcopus Dunkeldensis (translation: 'George Creichton Bishop of Dunkeld'). George Crichton was abbot at Holyrood Abbey in Edinburgh from 1515 to 1522, and it is believed that he was presented the lectern to the Abbey on being made Bishop of Dunkeld by Pope Alexander VI. The lectern was plundered by English invaders in 1544, lost (and recovered) in the English Civil War, and stolen by a group of Scottish nationalists in 1984. On two occasions the lectern was hidden in a grave. It remains the subject of dispute.|$|R
