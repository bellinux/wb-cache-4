[...] Lucas also described the character on another occasion stating that Summer was now smart and feisty, and she stands up for the things she believes in.

"Save the Last One" [...] {{marked the}} final {{appearance}} of Pruitt Taylor Vince, whose character was killed {{off in the}} episode after Shane shoots him; this subsequently marks {{a turning point for}} him as a false protagonist. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, writer Robert Kirkman explained the reaction of Jon Bernthal to the particular scene:"Jon Bernthal is a tremendous talent and he’s got a lot of professionalism. A lot of the actors came in to the room as we were starting this season and Bernthal was one of those actors. He was aware {{of a lot of the}} things that were coming up and we talked to him about his character and what we had planned for him this season and he was on board with a lot of it. It was nice being able to run though scenarios with him and get his opinion on how he perceived his character. Because actors, a lot of times, think about their characters more than the writers because they’re focused on that single character for months of their lives, if not years. He was all prepared for this."Kirkman expressed that the death of Otis was a [...] "somewhat justifiable homicide", and retorted that [...] "Otis was slowing him down, and Carl's life hangs in the balance." [...] He continued: [...] "It's The Walking Dead and we're existing in that gray area and we're really pushing the boundaries of that.

40|$|It {{has been}} said that there are three <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> drive the world's {{economic}} future. Firstly, computers; secondly, communications; and thirdly, direct marketing. There are countries that have reached the stage where direct marketing-oriented retailers have driven out the conventional retailer. The lack of South African retailers' use of direct marketing and their hesitant attitudes towards direct marketing communication media, such as direct mail, is cause for concern. This exploratory study investigates retailers' attitudes towards direct mail in an attempt to gain some insight into retailers' views of this marketing communication medium. The results indicate that retailers' attitudes towards direct mail differ with regard to factors such as the retailers' use of the medium, their age and their perceptions of consumer acceptance of direct mail. The study further identifies a need to communicate the advantages of direct mail to South African retailers...|$|E
