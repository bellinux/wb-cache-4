5|$|During their occupation, the French began {{construction}} {{of a series of}} fortifications on Richmond Hill.

5|$|Between the two World Wars, Nevada {{served in}} both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets. Though she had {{originally}} been equipped with 21 five-inch (127mm)/51 cal guns <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> enemy destroyers, this number was reduced to 12 in 1918, due to the overly wet bow and stern positions of the other nine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract One of {{the leading}} {{approaches}} {{to the nature of}} sensory pleasure reduces it to desire: roughly, a sensation qualifies as a sensation of pleasure just in case its subject wants to be feeling it. This approach is, in my view, correct, but it has never been formulated quite right; and it needs <b>to</b> <b>defended</b> <b>against</b> some compelling arguments. Thus {{the purpose of this paper}} is to discover the most defensible formulation of this rough idea, and <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> it <b>against</b> the most interesting objections...|$|R

5|$|Gilberto is good {{at helping}} <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> opponents who play a long ball game because he often man marks the opposition's attacking target-man. This cuts off the opposition's supply to the strikers, and thus forces the long-ball team to play through the midfield, {{something}} to which long-ball teams are not particularly suited.|$|E

Cao Cao's generals then destroy {{the army of the}} alive Dong Zhuo piecemeal at Ji Province ("Tales"), and he eradicates all of his foes. Cao Cao then chooses to go after Shu or Wu, depending on the result of the Chibi fire attack.|$|E
5|$|At 02:00 on 13 June the 13th/18th Royal Hussars {{squadron}} {{arrived at}} 'C' Company's {{position at the}} crossroads, later followed by fifty-one men from the 22nd Independent Parachute Company. Bréville was now in British control again {{for the third time}} since the landings on 6 June. But not in the numbers <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> a German counter-attack, so the 1st Battalion Royal Ulster Rifles, part of the 6th Airlanding Brigade, was moved into the village to take over from the survivors of the attack.|$|E

The Falaise Gap had been closed, trapping Model′s forces. As the linkup occurred, Model′s II SS Panzer Corps had begun its counterattack against Polish forces on Hill 262, hoping to reopen the pocket. With American and Canadian forces facing German counterattacks in their sectors, the Polish forces would have <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> two veteran Panzer divisions to keep the gap closed.|$|E

5|$|Cow Tower is an {{artillery}} tower {{that was built}} in the city of Norwich, Norfolk, England, between 1398 and 1399. Norwich was a prosperous city in the late 14th century, with a population of around 5,000 involved in key medieval industries and forming a centre for international trade. Between 1297 and 1350 the city had erected a circuit of defensive stone walls and ditches, both to impress upon outsiders the status of Norwich as a great city, but also <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> invasion or civil disorder.|$|E

However, there have been {{occasions}} where points have been deducted or the fighter using that strike in competition has been disqualified due to the move incapacitating fighters. In 2009, Matt Hamill defeated Jon Jones by disqualification due to Jones using 12-6 elbows. Hamill {{said that he was}} unable <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> the elbows.|$|E

5|$|Greece's mountainous terrain {{favored a}} {{defensive}} strategy {{and the high}} ranges of the Rhodope, Epirus, Pindus and Olympus mountains offered many defensive opportunities. However, air power was required to protect defending ground forces from entrapment in the many defiles. Although an invading force from Albania could be stopped by {{a relatively small number}} of troops positioned in the high Pindus mountains, the northeastern part of the country was difficult <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> an attack from the north.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Shaughnessy {{was rumored}} as a {{candidate}} for the vacant Washington Redskins head coaching job, but nothing came of it. From 1951 to 1962, Shaughnessy served {{on the staff of the}} Chicago Bears as a technical advisor, vice president, and defensive specialist. Halas retained responsibility for the offense, including the Bears' T formation. Ironically, Shaughnessy was tasked with developing a defense to counter the T formation. One of his solutions was the 5–3–3 defense, which left outside linebackers available <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> end runs and passes in the flat.|$|E
5|$|Iron Duke was {{the first}} British {{battleship}} to be mounted with anti-aircraft weaponry. In 1914, two 3in (7.62cm) QF guns were fitted to the aft superstructure, primarily <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> German airships. The guns fired between 1214 rounds per minute, and were expected to fire approximately 1,250 shells before replacement or repair was necessary. The shells fired were 12.5lb (5.67kg) with a high-explosive warhead. They were manually operated, and had a maximum effective ceiling of 23,500ft (7,160m).|$|E

Later he received instructions in the then-emerging and secretive field of LORAN navigation and was sent to Ulithi atoll, located between Guam and the Philippines. He assisted with LORAN research and development, and served on Ulithi for 15 months.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{defense against}} {{herbivory}} or host-plant resistance (HPR) describes {{a range of}} adaptations evolved by plants which improve their survival and reproduction by reducing the impact of herbivores. Plants can sense being touched, and they can use several strategies <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> damage caused by herbivores. Many plants produce secondary metabolites, known as allelochemicals, that influence the behavior, growth, or survival of herbivores. These chemical defenses can act as repellents or toxins to herbivores, or reduce plant digestibility.|$|E
5|$|The Last of Us is an action-adventure {{survival}} horror {{game played}} from a third-person perspective.

For most of the game, players control Joel, a man tasked with escorting a young girl, Ellie, across the United States; Ellie and other companions are controlled by the artificial intelligence. Players also control Ellie throughout the game's winter segment.|$|E
