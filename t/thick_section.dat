25|$|The de Marçay 4 was {{designed}} to compete for a contract under the 1921 French government 1921 C.1 (single seat fighter) programme. It was a wooden shoulder wing monoplane with a low aspect ratio, <b>thick</b> <b>section</b> wing. This was built around two spars and was braced from below on each side by an N-form strut from the spars, at 60% span, to the lower fuselage; its midsection {{was on top of}} the fuselage. There was no dihedral.|$|E
25|$|The E.1 was {{a wooden}} {{aircraft}} with spruce frames and plywood covering. It was a mid-wing cantilever monoplane with straight, <b>thick</b> <b>section,</b> constant chord wings of quite high aspect ratio (8.45). The lateral division was at about 65% chord, with the rear part joined {{to the front}} with conspicuous V-shaped faired underwing hinges. In normal flight the two parts were close together and the rear sections acted both as lifting surface and, differentially, ailerons but they could also be lowered together as slotted flaps, moving rearwards as well as down to produce a slot between fore and aft parts.|$|E

25|$|The Schwalbe was {{a single}} bay biplane with <b>thick</b> <b>section,</b> unequal span wooden wings which were built around twin spars and fabric covered. The wings had marked stagger and were braced between the spars with forward leaning, steel tube, N-form interplane struts. The lower wing was {{attached}} directly to the lower fuselage, from which the inner upper wing was braced with an outward leaning pair of parallel struts to the spars and held over the upper fuselage {{by a pair of}} inverted V-struts, one on each side, to the forward spar alone. The wings were straight-tapered in plan, with only slight sweep on the leading edge, out to rounded tips. They also tapered in thickness. The Schwalbe had ailerons on both wings, externally connected with vertical rods. The upper ailerons had large balances to serve both surfaces.|$|E

2500|$|The low-powered DP.VII was a simple, easily transportable, low-wing {{monoplane}} {{intended to}} make sports aviation more widely accessible. [...] It had a simple, <b>thick</b> <b>section</b> wing, essentially rectangular in plan apart from blunted, angled tips. [...] This had two main wooden box spars and was braced to the upper fuselage on each side with an inverted V-form pair of struts from the upper fuselage longerons to the spars at about one-third span. Unusually, the one-piece wing structure passed through the deep fuselage above the lower longerons and could be extracted {{in a few minutes}} then transported away [...] on a pair of trestles normally stowed inside the DP.VII. The aircraft had long-span ailerons filling about two-thirds of the wing.|$|E
2500|$|The cantilever, {{one-piece}} {{parasol wing}} of the U.8 was trapezoidal in plan, with long, elliptical tips. It had a <b>thick</b> <b>section</b> which thinned outwards and was built around two spruce box spars and fabric covered. Its ailerons tapered in chord out to the wing tips; together, they occupied 45% of the span. The wing was mounted a little above the fuselage on four short struts, two to each spar, an unusual arrangement used earlier on the U 5 and chosen by its designer, Hans Herrmanns, to improve both the aerodynamics at the wing-fuselage junction and cabin ventilation, a problem in small cabin aircraft of the time. Under the wing, part of the cabin roof was open. The wing struts, uncovered on the U 5, were covered by longitudinal panels.|$|E
2500|$|The Der Dessauer was a {{monoplane}} with a <b>thick</b> <b>section,</b> two-part, high wing, {{connected to}} the fuselage by a single, short, steep, tubular Dural lift strut from the upper fuselage longeron to the single wing spar on each side at about 15% of the span. [...] These struts were unusual in incorporating rubber shock absorbers which allowed a compression of [...] at landings, when the downward inertial forces were greatest. [...] They were rigid under lifting loads. Forward of the spar the wing was plywood skinned around the leading edge, forming a torsion resistant D-box, and behind it the wing was fabric-covered with wire defining the trailing edge. A rectangular plan centre section filled about half the span; outboard, the leading edge was slightly swept, leading to straight, oblique wing tips. [...] The trailing edges of these outer panels carried obliquely mounted differential ailerons which broadened to the tips.|$|E

2500|$|Like {{several other}} glider {{designers}} {{of the early}} 1930s, Lajos Rotter was impressed by Alexander Lippisch's Wien of 1929 and his high performance, single seat Karakán bears its influence. Like the Wien, the Karakán was a high aspect ratio sailplane with a two-piece high wing with a rectangular plan centre section and long, straight tapered outer panels. Both had <b>thick</b> <b>section</b> wings at the root which became progressively thinner over the outer panels. [...] On both designs, ailerons occupied the whole trailing edge of these outer panels. Structurally, the wings were similar, with two spars of unequal strength; the forward spar beams were part of plywood covered D-boxes around the leading edges and the rear spar was a lighter simple beam. The wings were fabric covered behind the main spar, as were the ailerons. Both designs had, on each side, an airfoil-faired V-form strut from the lower fuselage to the outer ends of the centre section, the forward member of the V, connected to the main spar, was more substantial than the rear.|$|E
2500|$|The T.III was a {{cantilever}} {{low wing}} monoplane with <b>thick</b> <b>section,</b> straight tapered, square tipped wings. Angular overhung ailerons were used. [...] Its fuselage was flat topped and sided and deep from tail to nose. The three crew sat in tandem, separate, open oval cockpits, with the forward two close together over the wing and fitted with dual control. The third cockpit was spaced further away behind the trailing edge and fitted with two machine guns, {{one on a}} conventional mounting firing upwards and the other firing downwards through the fuselage underside. [...] The rear cockpit also held the two release levers for 50kg (110lb) and for 100kg (220lb) bombs. [...] The braced tailplane was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage and carried horn-balanced elevators. In plan the tail was straight tapered and square tipped, with a large cut-out for rudder movement. There were several variations of the vertical tail though in all the rudder was straight edged and balanced. Some had no fin, with the rudder finishing at the keel and with a nick above the fuselage, another similar but with a rudder extension to below the keel and another still with a very short fin and small dorsal fillet but no fin extension.|$|E
6000|$|At last {{came the}} day of the second examination, and the {{professor}} of botany, a fussy, conscientious man, rearranged all the tables in a long narrow laboratory to prevent copying, and put his demonstrator on a chair on a table (where he felt, he said, like a Hindoo god), to see all the cheating, and stuck a notice outside the door, [...] "Door closed," [...] for no earthly reason that any human being could discover. And all the morning from ten till one the quill of Wedderburn shrieked defiance at Hill's, and the quills of the others chased their leaders in a tireless pack, and so also it was in the afternoon. Wedderburn was a little quieter than usual, and Hill's face was hot all day, and his overcoat bulged with textbooks and notebooks against the last moment's revision. And the next day, in the morning and in the afternoon, was the practical examination, when sections had to be cut and slides identified. In the morning Hill was depressed because he knew he had cut a <b>thick</b> <b>section,</b> and in the afternoon came the mysterious slip.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{suppose a}} mind of my sort cannot help but tend towards simplification, towards making all life turn upon some one {{dominant}} idea, complex perhaps in its reality but reducible at last to one consistent simple statement, a dominant idea which is essential as nothing else is essential, which makes and sustains and justifies. This is perhaps the innate disposition of the human mind, at least of the European mind--for I have some doubts about the Chinese. Theology drives obstinately towards an ultimate unity in God, science towards an ultimate unity in law, towards a fundamental element and a universal material truth from which all material truths evolve, and in matters of conduct there is the same tendency {{to refer to a}} universal moral law. Now this may be a simplification due to the need of the human mind to comprehend, and its inability to do so until the load is lightened by neglecting factors. William James has suggested that on account of this, theology may be obstinately working away from the truth, that the truth may be that there are several or many in compatible and incommensurable gods; science, in the same search for unity, may follow divergent methods of inquiry into ultimately uninterchangeable generalizations; and there may be not only not one universal moral law, but no effective reconciliation of the various rights and duties of a single individual. At any rate I find myself doubtful to this day about my own personal systems of right and wrong. I can never get all my life into one focus.
