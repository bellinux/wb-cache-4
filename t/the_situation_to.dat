5|$|In 1788, the Tây Sơn moved {{north to}} attack the Trịnh and unite Vietnam. Nguyễn Ánh took {{advantage}} of <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>to</b> return to southern Vietnam. After rebuilding his army, he recaptured Saigon on September 7, 1788. His grip on the south was enhanced {{by a group of}} Frenchmen and equipment that Pigneau had recruited, although the magnitude of the aid has been the source of dispute.|$|E

The new plan is to close Stamford instead, and Jan offers Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) the number two position in Scranton, but he is reluctant to accept it.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the post-communist period, the {{pharmaceutical}} industry has mainly been an obstacle to reform. Aiming to explore the vast market of the former USSR, they used <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>to</b> make professionals and services totally dependent on their financial sustenance, turned the major attention to the availability of medicines rather than that of psycho-social rehabilitation services, and stimulated corruption within the mental health sector very much.|$|E

5|$|A {{conflict}} between the new papal legate, Peter of Capua, and the Latin Patriarch of Antioch, Peter of Angoulême, who had become Raymond-Roupen's supporter, ended with the excommunication of the patriarch. Exploiting <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>to</b> get rid of his opponent, Bohemond replaced Peter of Angoulême with the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, SymeonII {{with the support of}} the commune in early 1207. Peter of Angoulême was reconciled with the legate, excommunicated Bohemond and the commune, and then persuaded some nobles to rise up against Bohemond, forcing him to take refuge in the citadel. Leo entered Antioch, but Bohemond collected his forces and defeated the Armenians. Peter of Angoulême was captured and died of drink deprivation in his prison.|$|E
5|$|Authorities rapidly {{ruled out}} the {{possibility}} that ETA had a cell in the island, with police believing the attack had been carried out by a unit that had travelled to the island specifically to carry it out. Initial reports stated that the bombers had set the bomb off with a remote control. Once the second bomb was spotted, police announced that it had a timer device, which could have allowed the members of ETA to plant the bomb several days before the attack and leave the island. Earlier, Government delegate for Majorca, Ramon Socías, had said that security forces believed that the bombers had not left Majorca, and were hiding on the island, waiting for <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>to</b> cool down before attempting to leave.|$|E

5|$|Bush also {{expressed}} U.S. {{support for the}} defense of Taiwan following the stand-off in April 2001 with the People's Republic of China over the Hainan Island incident, when an EP-3E Aries II surveillance aircraft collided with a People's Liberation Army Air Force jet, leading to the detention of U.S. personnel. From 2003 to 2004, Bush authorized U.S. military intervention in Haiti and Liberia to protect U.S. interests. Bush condemned the militia attacks Darfur and denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide. Bush said that an international peacekeeping presence was critical in Darfur, but opposed referring <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>to</b> the International Criminal Court.|$|E
5|$|Following their coordinated uprising, Michael the Brave {{attacked}} Ottoman strongholds {{along the}} Danube and recovered Giurgiu and Brăila, while Aaron the Tyrant seized Ismail (now in Ukraine). In response, the sultan ordered the Grand Vizier, Sinan Pasha to invade Wallachia. The two princes needed {{the support of}} Sigismund Báthory who took advantage of <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>to</b> make himself suzerain of Wallachia and Moldavia. When Aaron the Tyrant refused Sigismund Báthory's conditions, he {{was replaced by the}} latter's protégé, Ştefan Răzvan (1595) on the throne.|$|E
5|$|In Mackay's account, the panicked tulip speculators {{sought help}} from the {{government}} of the Netherlands, which responded by declaring that anyone who had bought contracts to purchase bulbs in the future could void their contract by payment of a 10 percent fee. Attempts were made to resolve <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>to</b> the satisfaction of all parties, but these were unsuccessful. The mania finally ended, Mackay says, with individuals stuck with the bulbs they held {{at the end of the}} crash—no court would enforce payment of a contract, since judges regarded the debts as contracted through gambling, and thus not enforceable by law.|$|E

5|$|On March 10, Archbishop Szoka {{reported}} <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>to</b> the Vatican. The Vatican delegated Archbishop Pio Laghi {{to address}} the matter, and he {{sent a message to}} Sister Theresa Kane, the national president of the Sisters of Mercy, telling Kane that she must convince Mansour to resign as director of DSS. Kane refused, as did Detroit Provincial Superior Emily George who was the Vice President of the Sisters of Mercy of the Union, and was previously (as Mary Karl George) the president of Mercy College, before Mansour.|$|E
5|$|On November 17, 1997, {{an empty}} train {{collided}} with another train waiting to depart Union Station with over 800 passengers on board.

The two trains then collided at a speed of , causing a partial derailment and minor injuries to fifty-four passengers and two crew members. The subsequent Transportation Safety Board report made recommendations, including making emergency brakes more accessible and that the locomotive engineer must always control the train from the leading end in the Union Station Rail Corridor.|$|E
5|$|Ron chases Scabbers, {{only to be}} {{attacked}} by a big black dog, which Harry has seen several times before.

Harry and Hermione follow, {{and there is a}} brief standoff when they find Ron with Sirius Black, who has transformed from the dog. Lupin enters, and they explain <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>to</b> Harry and his friends: Lupin is a werewolf, which led to his friends James Potter, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew becoming animagi. Lupin explains that Scabbers is Pettigrew in his animal form; he has been hiding from Black, whom he had framed for the murders of Harry's parents and the thirteen Muggles.|$|E

5|$|Since the Separatists are {{secretly}} {{building a}} battle droid army, Palpatine uses <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>to</b> have himself granted emergency powers. Palpatine feigns reluctance {{to accept this}} authority, promising to {{return it to the}} Senate once the crisis has ended. His first act is to allow the creation of a clone army to counter the Separatist threat; this results in the opening salvo of the Clone Wars. With the galaxy now at war as Sidious planned, Dooku brings him the secret plans for a new superweapon.|$|E

Black Hawk asserted later that had Posey chose to attack him and his warriors that the blow dealt Black Hawk's band would have been decisive and war-ending. In fact, Dement's opinion was that there were more Native Americans at Kellogg's Grove than at any other engagement during the war.
