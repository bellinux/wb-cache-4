5|$|Although N. rajah has a {{restricted}} distribution {{and is often}} quoted as a plant in peril, it is not rare in the areas where it does grow and most populations are now off-limits to visitors and lie in remote parts of Kinabalu National Park.

50|$|In {{high school}} and collegiate baseball, <b>the</b> <b>pitcher</b> must be {{completely}} off of {{and away from the}} pitching rubber. It is also a balk (NFHS R6-S2-A5) if a runner or runners are on base and <b>the</b> <b>pitcher,</b> while he is not touching <b>the</b> <b>pitcher's</b> plate, makes any movement naturally associated with his pitch, or he places his feet on or astride <b>the</b> <b>pitcher's</b> plate, or positions himself within approximately five feet of <b>the</b> <b>pitcher's</b> plate without having the ball. In professional baseball, under Rule 8.05(i), a balk occurs if <b>the</b> <b>pitcher</b> is standing on or astride of the pitching rubber without the ball.

50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{distinct}} throwing styles used by <b>pitchers.</b> <b>The</b> most common style is a three-quarters delivery in which <b>the</b> <b>pitcher's</b> arm snaps downward with the release of <b>the</b> ball.

25|$|A passive trap, pitfall traps attract prey with nectar bribes {{secreted}} by the peristome {{and bright}} flower-like anthocyanin patterning within <b>the</b> <b>pitcher.</b> <b>The</b> linings of most pitcher plants {{are covered in}} a loose coating of waxy flakes which are slippery for insects, causing them to fall into <b>the</b> <b>pitcher.</b> Once within <b>the</b> <b>pitcher</b> structure, digestive enzymes or mutualistic species break down the prey into an absorbable form for the plant.

50|$|In college baseball, NCAA rules {{state that}} the {{designated}} hitter must hit for <b>the</b> <b>pitcher,</b> but in many instances <b>the</b> <b>pitcher</b> {{is also a good}} hitter, and the coach may elect to let <b>the</b> <b>pitcher</b> bat in <b>the</b> lineup.

However, if a player who starts a game as a P/DH is relieved as <b>the</b> starting <b>pitcher,</b> he may not return to the mound even if he remains in the game as the DH, and he may not play any other defensive position after being relieved as <b>the</b> <b>pitcher.</b> Conversely, a player who begins the game as the DH, but not as <b>the</b> <b>pitcher,</b> may come into the game as a reliever and remain as the DH (in effect becoming a P/DH), be relieved on the mound later in the game but continue to bat as the DH.|$|R

25|$|When {{it comes}} to player {{selection}} for the All-Star Game, the Lewis & Clark Baseball League deviates from its typical following of Major League Baseball procedures.

25|$|The {{range of}} colours {{displayed}} by <b>the</b> <b>pitchers</b> of N.leonardoi is exceptional among Philippine Nepenthes. Lower pitchers are most commonly orange to red on their outer surfaces, often flecked with slightly darker purple markings.

The lid is yellow to orange, frequently with red highlights.|$|E
25|$|Organisms that {{spend at}} least part of their lives within <b>the</b> <b>pitchers</b> of Nepenthes species are often called Nepenthes infauna. The most common infaunal species, often {{representing}} the top trophic level of the infaunal ecosystem, are many species of mosquito larvae. Other infaunal species include fly and midge larvae, spiders, mites, ants, and even a species of crab (Geosesarma malayanum). Many of these species specialise to one pitcher plant species and are found nowhere else. These specialists are called nepenthebionts. Others, often associated with but not dependent on Nepenthes species, are called nepenthophiles. Nepenthexenes, on the other hand, are rarely found in <b>the</b> <b>pitchers,</b> but will often appear when putrefaction approaches a certain threshold, attracting fly larvae that would normally not be found in the pitcher infaunal community. The complex ecological relationship between pitcher plants and infauna is not yet fully understood, but the relationship may be mutualistic: the infauna is given shelter, food, or protection, and the plant that harbours the infauna receives expedited breakdown of captured prey, increasing the rate of digestion and keeping harmful bacterial populations repressed.|$|E
