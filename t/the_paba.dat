60|$|Now {{when the}} cacique heard this {{he saw that}} Marina spoke truth, and hurrying up the teocalli, he caught the knife {{as it was in}} the act of falling upon me. At first the head priest was angered and called out that this was sacrilege, but when the cacique had told him his mind, he {{understood}} that he would do wisely not to run a risk of the wrath of Montezuma. So I was loosed and led into the sanctuary, and when I came out <b>the</b> <b>paba</b> announced to the people that the god had declared me to be one of his children, and it was for this reason that then and thereafter they treated me with reverence.|$|E
60|$|Scarcely was {{the first}} victim dead when the second was seized and treated in a like fashion, the {{multitude}} prostrating themselves as before. And then last of all came my turn. I felt myself seized and my senses swam, nor did I recover them till I found myself lying on the accursed stone, the priests dragging at my limbs and head, my breast strained upwards till the skin was stretched tight {{as that of a}} drum, while over me stood the human devil in his red mantle, the glass knife in his hand. Never shall I forget his wicked face maddened with the lust for blood, or the glare in his eyes as he tossed back his matted locks. But he did not strike at once, he gloated over me, pricking me with the point of the knife. It seemed to me that I lay there for years while <b>the</b> <b>paba</b> aimed and pointed with the knife, but at last through a mist that gathered before my eyes, I saw it flash upward. Then when I thought that my hour had come, a hand caught his arm in mid-air and held it and I heard a voice whispering.|$|E

6000|$|They hesitated, for {{though he}} who {{commanded}} was a prince {{of the blood}} royal, to lay hands upon a high priest was sacrilege. Then with a smile Guatemoc drew forth a ring having a dull blue stone set in its bezel, on which was engraved a strange device. With the ring he drew out also a scroll of picture-writing, and held them both before the eyes of <b>the</b> <b>pabas.</b> Now <b>the</b> ring was the ring of Montezuma, and the scroll was signed by the great high priest of Tenoctitlan, and those who looked on the ring and the scroll knew well that to disobey the mandate of him who bore them was death and dishonour in one.

60|$|Now I {{passed out}} of the storehouse, {{shutting}} the door behind me. A minute later I wished that I had stayed where I was, since on the platform my eyes were greeted by a sight more dreadful than any that had gone before. For there, advancing towards us, were the women divided into four great companies, some of them bearing infants in their arms. They came singing and leaping, many of them naked to the middle. Nor was this all, for {{in front of them}} ran <b>the</b> <b>pabas</b> and such of the women themselves as were persons in authority.

60|$|Now {{this was}} a little matter, but its results were large.

I do not know if I could have saved him, I only know that I did not try, and that because of his death great sorrows came upon me. Whether I was right or wrong, who can say?

60|$|I rushed forward, {{and turning}} {{the angle of}} the temple I found myself {{face to face with the}} past, for there as in bygone years were <b>the</b> <b>pabas</b> clad in their black robes, their long hair hanging about their shoulders, the dreadful knife of glass fixed in their girdles; there to the right of the stone of {{sacrifice}} were those destined to the god, and there being led towards it was the first victim, a Tlascalan prisoner, his limbs held by men clad in the dress of priests. Near him, arrayed in the scarlet robe of sacrifice, stood one of my own captains, who I remembered had once served as a priest of Tezcat before idolatry was forbidden in the City of Pines, and around were a wide circle of women that watched, and from whose lips swelled the awful chant.|$|R

For {{an hour or more}} they celebrated this ghastly carnival, of which even I, versed as I was in the Indian customs, could not fully understand the meaning, and then, as though some single impulse had possessed them, they withdrew to the centre of the open space, and, forming themselves into a double circle, within which stood <b>the</b> <b>pabas,</b> of a sudden they burst into a chant so wild and shrill that as I listened my blood curdled in my veins.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the degradation of triclosan (TCS) {{in the presence of}} p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) under simulated sunlight irradiation (lambda >= 290 nm). <b>The</b> effect of <b>PABA</b> concentration, pH, dissolved organic matter (DOM), and DOM-hydrolytic Fe(III) species complexes on the photodegradation of TCS in <b>the</b> presence of <b>PABA</b> (TCS-PABA) was also studied. The photolysis of TCS-PABA obeyed pseudo-first-order kinetics well, and the degradation of TCS-PABA enhanced with increasing solution pH (from 3. 0 to 11. 0). <b>The</b> presence of <b>PABA</b> inhibited <b>the</b> degradation of TCS-PABA, and the weakest inhibitory effect was observed while <b>the</b> concentration of <b>PABA</b> was 5 mg L- 1. The addition of DOM (Suwannee River fulvic acid standard I [SRFA], Suwannee River HA standard II [SRHA], and Suwannee River natural organic matter [SRNOM]) showed different inhibition effects on TCS-PABA degradation. However, higher Fe(III) concentration at the DOM concentration of 5 mg L- 1 could favor the formation of DOM-hydrolytic Fe(III) species complexes, further accelerating the degradation of TCS-PABA. In comparison with deionized water (DI water), TCS-PABA could be better photodegraded in river water nearby the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant. This study provides useful information for understanding the natural behavior of TCS in the presence of other organic contaminants...|$|R

Naked to the waist, his hands bound behind him, his grizzled locks hanging about his breast, his keen eyes fixed upon the faces of his heathen foes in menace rather than in supplication, his thin lips muttering prayers, Father Pedro passed on to the place of his doom, now and again shaking his head fiercely to free himself from the torment of the insects which buzzed about it.|$|R
