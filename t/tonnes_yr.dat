Whether the continental stock has equallydeclin ed is uncertain. This studyco mpiles available landings statistics {{since the beginning}} of the 20 th century and identifies trends over time and space, using a statistical model that takes varying levels of reporting into account. Landings in the pre- 1940 s reached over 40 000 <b>tonnes</b> <b>yr)</b> 1, declined during World War II, rose to a peak of 40 000 <b>tonnes</b> <b>yr)</b> 1 in the 1960 s (coincident with a peak in re-stocking) and dropped to an all time low o...|$|E
40|$|Feedbacks {{on climate}} change so far {{identified}} are predominantly positive, enhancing the rate of change. Loss of sea-ice, increase in desert areas, water vapour increase, loss of tropical rain forest and the restriction of significant areas of marine productivity to higher latitude (thus smaller geographical zones) all lead to an enhancement of the rate of change. The other major feedback identified, changes in cloud radiation, will produce either a positive feedback, if high level clouds are produced, or a negative feedback if low level clouds are produced. Few significant negative feedbacks have been identified, let alone quantified. Here, we show {{that the loss of}} ice shelves and retreat of coastal glaciers around the Antarctic Peninsula in the last 50 years has exposed at least 2. 4 104 km 2 of new open water. We estimate that these new areas of open water have allowed new phytoplankton blooms containing a total standing stock of 5. 0 105 tonnes of carbon to be produced. New marine zooplankton and seabed communities have also been produced, which we estimate contain 4. 1 105 tonnes of carbon. This previously unquantified carbon sink acts as a negative feedback to climate change. New annual productivity, as opposed to standing stock, amounts to 3. 5 106 <b>tonnes</b> <b>yr</b> 1 of carbon, of which 6. 9 105 <b>tonnes</b> <b>yr</b> 1 deposits to the seabed. By comparison the total aboveground biomasses of lowland American tropical rainforest is 160 – 435 tonnes ha 1. Around 50 % of this is carbon. On this basis the carbon held in new biomass described here is roughly equivalent to 6000 – 17 000 ha of tropical rainforest. As ice loss increases in polar regions this feedback will become stronger, and eventually, over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, over 50 Mtonnes of new carbon could be fixed annually in new coastal phytoplankton blooms and over 10 Mtonnes yr 1 locked in biological standing stock around Antarctica...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} potential marine modification of {{two classes of}} terrestrial influence on Gulf hypoxia: (1) the flow of nutrient-rich water from the Mississippi/Atchafalaya River Basin and (2) the massive physical, hydrological, chemical and biological change associated with the Atchafalaya’s partial capture of the Mississippi River. The latter involves repartitioning of a total flow of about 20 000 m 3 sec − 1, {{equal to that of}} 13 Nile Rivers, and a sediment load of 210 million metric <b>tonnes</b> <b>yr</b> − 1,nearly 20 times that delivered by all of the rivers of the East Coast of the USA. Also involved is the loss of hundreds-to-thousands of years of stored nutrients and organic matter to the Gulf from enormous coastal wetland loss. This study found that the oceanography of the Gulf minimises the impact of both classes of terrestrial influence from the Mississippi River and its nearby estuaries on Gulf hypoxia. Oceanographic conditions give events associated with the Atchafalaya River a disproportionately large influence on Gulf hypoxia. A truly holistic environmental approach which includes the full effects of this highly dynamic coastal area is recommended to better understand and control Gulf hypoxia...|$|E
40|$|The Issaquah Creek {{watershed}} is {{a rapidly}} urbanizing watershed of 144 km 2 in western Washington, where sediment aggradation {{of the main}} channel and delivery of fine sediment into a large downstream lake have raised increasingly frequent concerns over flooding, loss of fish habitat, and degraded water quality. A watershed-scale sediment budget was evaluated to determine the relative effects of land-use practices, including urbanization, on sediment supply and delivery, and to guide management responses towards the most effective source-reduction strategies. Human activity in the watershed, particularly urban development, has caused an increase of nearly 50 % in the annual sediment yield, now estimated to be 44 <b>tonnes</b> km 22 <b>yr</b> 21. The main sources of sediment in the watershed are landslides (50 %), channel-bank erosion (20 %), and road-surface erosion (15 %). This assessment characterizes the role of human activity in mixed-use watersheds such as this, and it demonstrates {{some of the key}} processes, particularly enhanced stream-channel erosion, by which urban developmen...|$|R
40|$|Bottom-mounted {{acoustic}} Doppler current profiler measurementsindicate {{that the}} net {{transport of water}} (844 m 3 s - 1) in theLittle Belt makes up only 6 % of the total transport betweenthe Baltic Sea and the North Sea. This is a smaller percentagethan the 9 % commonly found in the literature. Owing to barotropicand tidal currents the gross transport is 5 times larger. Thenet transport is directed towards the North Sea mainly in thetop 32 m of the water column but towards the Baltic Sea it occursin the lower 5 m of the water column. The resulting transportof phosphorus is strongly affected by vertical mixing in an areaof hydraulic control in the narrow part of the Little Belt. Comparisonsof phosphorus profiles in stratified waters and in the mixingarea indicate a yearly entrainment of 15 tonnes P from the bottomwater to the surface layer. This vertical transport of P formspart of an internal loop in the general transport between theBaltic Sea and the North Sea. Compared to the transport observed 15 - 16 years ago, the present net phosphorus transport of 163 <b>tonnes</b> <b>yr</b> - 1 from the Baltic Sea through the Little Belt is substantiallylower...|$|E
40|$|As a {{first step}} in {{applying}} the Integrated Nitrogen model for CAtchments (INCA) to the Simojoki river basin (3160 km 2), this paper focuses on calibration of the hydrological part of the model and nitrogen (N) dynamics in the river during the 1980 s and 1990 s. The model application utilised the GIS land-use and forest classification of Finland together with a recent forest inventory based on remote sensing. In the INCA model, the Hydrologically Effective Rainfall (HER) is used to drive the water flow and N fluxes through the catchment system. HER was derived from the Watershed Simulation and Forecast System (WSFS). The basic component of the WSFS is a conceptual hydrological model which simulates runoff using precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and temperature data as inputs. Spatially uniform, lumped input data were calculated for the whole river basin and spatially semi-distributed input data were calculated for each of the nine sub-basins. When comparing discharges simulated by the INCA model with observed values, a better fit was obtained with the semi-distributed data than with the spatially uniform data (R 2 0. 78 v. 0. 70 at Hosionkoski and 0. 88 v. 0. 78 at the river outlet). The timing of flow peaks was simulated rather well with both approaches, although the semi-distributed input data gave a more realistic simulation of low flow periods and the magnitude of spring flow peaks. The river basin has a relatively closed N cycle with low input and output fluxes of inorganic N. During 1982 - 2000, the average total N flux to the sea was 715 <b>tonnes</b> <b>yr</b> – 1, of which 6 % was NH 4 -N, 14 % NO 3 -N, and 80 % organic N. Annual variation in river flow and the concentrations of major N fractions in river water, and factors affecting this variation are discussed.
