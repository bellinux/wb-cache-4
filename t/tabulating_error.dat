Its medication error prevention efforts began in 1975 with a column in Hospital Pharmacy to inform healthcare professionals and others about medication error prevention. ISMP operates a voluntary practitioner error-reporting program to <b>tabulate</b> <b>errors</b> nationally, understand their causes, and share “lessons learned” with the healthcare community, known as the Medication Errors Reporting Program (MERP), operated by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) in cooperation with ISMP. In addition, ISMP’s corporate subsidiary, Med-E.R.R.S. (Medical Error Recognition and Revision Strategies), works directly and confidentially with the pharmaceutical industry to prevent errors that stem from confusing or misleading naming, labeling, packaging, and device design. The ISMP list of error-prone abbreviations is distributed nationally.|$|R

The accuracies of six global burned area (BA) products for year 2008 were compared using the same validation methods and reference data to quantify accuracy of each product. The selected products include MCD 64, MCD 45 and Geoland 2, and three products developed within the Fire Disturbance project (fire_cci), {{which is part of the}} European Space Agency's (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) program. The latter three products were derived from MERIS and VEGETATION sensors (one product from each sensor separately, and a third one from the merging of MERIS and VGT products). The reference fire perimeters were mapped from two multi-temporal Landsat TM/ETM + images at 103 non-overlapping Thiessen scene areas (TSA) selected with a stratified random sampling design. The validation results were based on cross <b>tabulated</b> <b>error</b> matrices from which six accuracy measures were computed following the requirements of end-users of burned area products. While overall accuracy (OA) exceeded 99 % for all products, overall accuracy was lower for the burned class. Burned area commission error ratio was above 40 % for all products and omission error ratio was above 65 % for all products. The statistical significance of differences in accuracy between pairs of products was evaluated based on theory of the stratified combined ratio estimator. Statistical tests identified the MCD 64 as the most accurate product, followed by MCD 45 and the MERIS product. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} been made {{concerning}} the difficulties which business mathematics students have in solving stated problems. Such {{studies have been}} made by analyzing the student's errors as they appear on written solutions to problems, and, as a result, many errors are overlooked. Errors in the thinking process, and failure to read the problem a sufficient number of times are responsible for many errors made by students. Such errors are not apparent on written solutions, but would be revealed through oral solutions as recorded on a wire recorder.

These instances of CS are collected from Brazilian Portuguese print media published by immigrant communities in Massachusetts. Print material in Brazilian Portuguese was gathered from townships and cities in the South Shore of Massachusetts, which have been documented as having large Portuguese-speaking populations. The data were analyzed by <b>tabulating</b> orthographic <b>errors,</b> examples of code-switching, false cognates and language anomalies. The results were compared to those found in Poplack (1980), Gardner-Chloros (2009), and Hill (1993), among others. The results revealed a clear relationship between the presence of CS and the instability of immigrants’ first language with possible evidence of attrition and language shift. The paper also advances the idea that the presence of CS in the community’s media is a prominent indicator of the emerging identity of immigrants in Southeastern Massachusetts...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} work is {{to develop}} a numerical computation program to determine the geometrical characteristics of arbitrary simply connected planar sections and applications to airfoils. In the literature, there are exact analytical solutions only for some simples’ geometries, such as circular, rectangular and elliptical sections. Hence our interest is focused on the search of approximate numerical solutions for more complex sections used in aeronautics. The used method is to subdivide the section in the infinitesimal triangular sections with a single observer within the area having a suitable position. The characteristics of any triangle, given by the positions of these three nodes are known in the literature. Using the principle of compound surfaces, one can determine the geometric characteristics of the airfoil surface. The analytic function of the airfoil boundary is obtained by using the cubic spline interpolation because the airfoil is given in the form of <b>tabulated</b> points. <b>Error</b> estimation is done to determine the accuracy of the numerical computation...|$|R
40|$|Expansion {{distances}} (or expansion parallaxes) for classical novae {{are based}} on comparing a measurement of the shell expansion velocity, multiplied by the time since outburst, with some measure of the angular size of the shell. We review and formalize this method {{in the case of}} prolate spheroidal shells. For such shells there is no unique angular size except when the shell is seen pole-on, and several different measures of angular size have been used in the literature. We present expressions for the maximum line-of-sight velocity from a complete, expanding shell and for its projected major and minor axes, in terms of the intrinsic axis ratio and the inclination of the polar axis to the line of sight. For six distinct definitions of “angular size”, we <b>tabulate</b> the <b>error</b> in distance that is introduced under the assumption of spherical symmetry (i. e., without correcting for inclination and axis ratio). The errors can be significant and systematic, and can affect studies of novae whether considered individually or statistically.

In 1799 he delivered A Method of finding the Latitude of a place, by Means of two Altitudes of the Sun and the Time elapsed betwixt the Observations, described as containing [...] "several valuable remarks", but criticised as [...] "a subject of no great importance" [...] by the Philosophical Magazine. In his 1809 work On A Method of Examining the Divisions of Astronomical Instruments Lax wrote that no instrument was to be trusted without [...] "previous examination". This argument had an influence on scientists such as Henry Cavendish and was described as an [...] "ingenious...examination" [...] in the Edinburgh Encyclopedia. However the method described by Lax [...] "though very ingenious, requires great labour and time, and is inferior in accuracy and efficiency to that which was adopted by Mr. Troughton for <b>tabulating</b> the <b>errors</b> of the primary divisions of circular instruments." [...] It was also criticised for [...] "greatly resembl" [...] a method first explicated by the Duke of Chaulnes. In 1807 Lax delivered Remarks on a Supposed Error in the Elements of Euclid to the Royal Society, however it was not published in Philosophical Transactions, but was eventually published independently. In it Lax defended the Greek mathematician against a charge levied at him by Georges-Louis Le Sage in 1756. Lax's defence was applauded by the British Critic as 'perfectly sound'. Lax also espoused the worth of Euclid's Elements in the work, which he considered to reflect [...] "the highest honour upon the human intellect".|$|R

We calculate a binned anisotropy power spectrum, which we <b>tabulate,</b> along with <b>error</b> bars and bin-to-bin correlations, {{so that it can}} be easily used for constraining models. The resulting power spectrum is flat at large angles, with a gradual rise to a prominent peak at around 0. 5 degrees and a decrease thereafter. This is precisely the shape predicted by inflationary-inspired adiabatic models. Within that class of cosmologies, this characteristic scale imprinted on the CMB sky can be used to infer that the geometry of the Universe is very close to flat. The next wave of CMB results should add fuel to the debate about whether or not the Universe once inflated, as well as beginning in earnest the task of measuring cosmological parameters.

50|$|The collapsed-coordinate {{system has}} three {{independent}} variables {{instead of the}} six demanded by the Kronecker-product system. The reduction of independent variables makes use of three properties of gas-phase, ground-state, triatomic molecules. (1) In general, whatever {{the total number of}} constituent atomic valence electrons, data for isoelectronic molecules tend to be more similar than for adjacent molecules that have more or fewer valence electrons; for triatomic molecules, the electron count is the sum of the atomic group numbers (the sum of the column numbers 1 to 8 in the p-block of the periodic chart of the elements, C1+C2+C3). (2) Linear/bent triatomic molecules appear to be slightly more stable, other parameters being equal, if carbon is the central atom. (3) Most physical properties of diatomic molecules (especially spectroscopic constants) are closely monotonic with respect to the product of the two atomic period (or row) numbers, R1 and R2; for triatomic molecules, the monotonicity is close with respect to R1R2+R2R3 (which reduces to R1R2 for diatomic molecules). Therefore, the coordinates x, y, and z of the collapsed-coordinate system are C1+C2+C3, C2, and R1R2+R2R3. Multiple-regression predictions of four property values for molecules with tabulated data agree very well with the <b>tabulated</b> data (the <b>error</b> measures of the predictions include the tabulated data in all but a few cases).|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{grammatical}} errors in English writing {{has been done}} by many researchers. Error means any deviation from a selected norm of language performance, no matter what the characteristics or causes of the deviation might be. As well the studies that are conducted by those researchers, this study is also going to investigate the grammatical errors in the Abstracts of Ulul Albab Scientific Journal. This research is very important to be conducted because Ulul Albab scientific journal is an academic journal that fills the ideas of the experts who search about religion, science, technology and others that some of the writers of this journal used English language on the abstracts of the articles. Since this journal is read by many people especially by the academics at nation wide universities, hence, it should be correctly written by standard English writing. Errors are classified into four types, the first is linguistic category taxonomy, the second is surface strategy taxonomy, the third is communicative effect taxonomy, and the fourth is comparative taxonomy. This study intends to analyze grammatical errors based on surface strategy taxonomy specifically on morphological and syntactical errors, which includes four types of errors: omission, addition, misformation, and misordering. In order to bring this study into its purpose, the researcher formulates the research problem: What types of grammatical errors occur in the abstract of “Ulul Albab” scientific journal. This study is a library research and uses descriptive qualitative method. Descriptive qualitative tries to describe, identify, classify and <b>tabulate</b> the <b>errors</b> found in the abstracts of Ulul Albab scientific journal in constructing grammatical rules, which are obtained from the abstracts.

The instrument of this study is the researcher herself. It is because the data of this research are written data from the abstracts of Ulul Albab scientific journal. This study found that the dominant mistakes on the abstracts are errors in omission types followed by addition errors, misformation and the last is misordering. Then, this study also found that the highest numbers of omission errors are omission of articles...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} aims at {{analyzing the}} thin film flow passed over an inclined moving plate. The differential type non-Newtonian fluid of Williamson {{has been used}} as a base fluid in its unsteady state. The physical configuration of the oscillatory flow pattern has been demonstrated and especial attention has been paid to the oscillatory phenomena. The shear stresses have been combined with the energy equation. The uniform magnetic field has been applied perpendicularly to the flow field. The principal equations for fluid motion and temperature profiles have been modeled and simplified in the form of non-linear partial differential equations. The non-linear differential equations have been solved with the help of a powerful analytical technique known as Optimal Homotopy Asymptotic Method (OHAM). This method contains unknown convergence controlling parameters C 1, C 2, C 3, [...] . which results in more efficient and fast convergence as compared to other analytical techniques. The OHAM results have been verified by using a second method known as Adomian Decomposition Method (ADM). The closed agreement of these two methods and the fast convergence of OHAM has been shown graphically and numerically. The comparison of the present work and published work has also been equated graphically and <b>tabulated</b> with absolute <b>error.</b> Moreover, the effect of important physical parameters like magnetic parameter M, gravitational parameter m, Oscillating parameter ω, Eckert number E c and Williamson number W e have also been derived and discussed in this article...|$|R
40|$|All {{types of}} image {{registration}} require {{some type of}} resampling, either during the registration or as a final step in the registration process. Thus the image(s) must be regridded into a spatially uniform, or angularly uniform, coordinate system with some pre-defined resolution. Frequently the ending resolution is not the resolution at which the data was observed with. The registration algorithm designer and end product user are presented with a multitude of possible resampling methods each of which modify the spatial frequency content of the data in some way. The {{purpose of this paper}} is threefold: (1) to show how an imaging system modifies the scene from an end to end optical systems analysis approach, (2) to develop a generalized resampling model, and (3) empirically apply the model to simulated radiometric scene data and tabulate the results. A Hanning windowed sinc interpolator method will be developed based upon the optical characterization of the system. It will be discussed in terms of the effects and limitations of sampling, aliasing, spectral leakage, and computational complexity. Simulated radiometric scene data will be used to demonstrate each of the algorithms. A high resolution scene will be "grown" using a fractal growth algorithm based on mid-point recursion techniques. The result scene data will be convolved with a point spread function representing the optical response. The resultant scene will be convolved with the detection systems response and subsampled to the desired resolution. The resultant data product will be subsequently resampled to the correct grid using the Hanning windowed sinc interpolator and the results and <b>errors</b> <b>tabulated</b> and discussed...|$|R

40|$|A {{model for}} {{nucleate}} boiling inception and cessation is presented {{which provides a}} rational unified explanation of the following experimentally observed phenomena: (1) the wall superheat {{at the onset of}} nucleate boiling is dependent upon the working fluid and past thermal history of the fluid-solid surface. (2) for most fluids other than water, a large difference exists between the wall superheat at the onset and at the cessation of nucleate boiling. (3) fluid flow has a negligible effect on the incipient boiling wall superheat for most fluids. Water is a notable exception. In this study fluids R- 11 and water are used to illustrate the behaviour of well and poor wetting liquids respectively. The analysis allowed the following conclusions to be drawn: (1) only re-entrant cavities can retain vapour bubble embryos during a non-boiling period. As subcooling of a site fluid increases, cavities with the largest embryos are quenched first. Dormant site radii are of the order of 1 μm. (2) at incipient boiling conditions, stable bubble embryos of well wetting substances can only exist attached to the mouth of a re-entrant (sub) cavity. (3) under certain conditions stable bubble embryos of a poor wetting substance can also attach at the mouth of a conical cavity. Since incipient boiling is a function only of the wall superheat surrounding the bubble embryo, it can be affected by fluid flow only if the bubble protrudes into a non isothermal boundary layer or is physically deformed by the flow or the cavity pressure is affected by the flow. This is unlikely to occur with well wetting liquids and is very likely to occur for water. The common version of the integrated Clapeyron equation predicted liquid superheats which were very sensitive to the temperature at which the properties were evaluated. A comparison of these liquid superheats with those obtained using <b>tabulated</b> data showed <b>errors</b> of as much as 400...|$|R
