5|$|To fix the {{problems}} McClellan perceived in Washington's defenses, he directed Colonel Barnard {{to construct a}} continuous line from <b>the</b> <b>Potomac</b> north of Alexandria to a point west of the Aqueduct Bridge, {{one of the three}} bridges that crossed <b>the</b> <b>Potomac</b> River. By the time the Army of <b>the</b> <b>Potomac</b> was deployed for the Peninsula Campaign in March 1862, the line of defenses stretched completely around Washington, and extensions to the ring of defenses ensured the protection of the town of Alexandria and the Chain Bridge, the furthest west of the three bridges connecting Maryland and Virginia.|$|E

The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the CSS Virginia, formerly the USS Merrimack, damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk, Virginia, before being engaged and damaged by the USS Monitor.

5|$|Major General George B. McClellan, {{commanding}} the Army of <b>the</b> <b>Potomac,</b> determined {{to take the}} Confederate capital of Richmond via the Virginia Peninsula. This unexpected move would, in theory, allow McClellan's army to move quickly up the peninsula rather than fighting through Northern Virginia. During March 1862, the Army of <b>the</b> <b>Potomac</b> was gradually transferred by water to Fortress Monroe {{at the end of}} the Virginia Peninsula. On March 10, 1862, the 22nd left their winter camp and were shipped to Fortress Monroe. By April 4, the regiment began to advance, along with many other elements of the Army of <b>the</b> <b>Potomac,</b> up the peninsula.|$|E

5|$|To {{remedy the}} situation, one of McClellan's first orders upon taking command was to greatly expand the {{defenses}} of Washington. At all {{points of the}} compass, forts and entrenchments would be constructed in sufficient strength to defeat any attack. One area of particular concern was the region of Maryland south of the Anacostia River. Confederate artillery floated across <b>the</b> <b>Potomac</b> in secret and mounted south of the river could threaten the Washington Navy Yard and Washington Arsenal, both of which lay at the junction of <b>the</b> <b>Potomac</b> and Anacostia Rivers.|$|E

Alexander accepted and served in that capacity throughout 1862.

Rather than falling under the patronage of the society, Foote's new institution fell {{under the control of the}} Presbyterian church. Following Foote's departure, the society selected Professor E.

Another report, this time about General George Meade, angered Meade enough that he punished Edward Crapsey, the reporter who wrote it.
