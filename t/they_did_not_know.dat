5|$|On 17 December, Ferdinand again {{asked the}} castle's {{defenders}} to surrender. They replied that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> {{the meaning of}} the word and would hold the Godesburg to the last man. A report dated 23 December 1583 relates that, having given Ferdinand a rude reply, the defenders went back to lunch.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the start}} of the Browns' 1954 {{training}} camp, Graham was questioned as part of the Sam Sheppard murder case. Sheppard, an osteopath, was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant wife to death, and Graham and his wife, Beverly, were friends with the couple. Graham told police that while he and Beverly liked the Sheppards, <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> much about their relationship.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} first {{millennium}} BC, Babylonian astronomers {{observed that the}} Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, though <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> why; it is today known that {{this is due to}} the movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion.|$|E
5|$|Senegal's {{independence}} was declared on August 20, 1960, {{and after the}} dissolution of the short-lived Mali Federation, Casamance saw the arrival of officials coming from the north. Although many of them were Wolofs and Muslims, <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> the Jola country and its traditions. The periods of drought that ravaged the Sahel in the 1970s forced peanut farmers to move to regions where rice was all that grew.|$|E

5|$|Simultaneously, {{a nearby}} Army {{reconnaissance}} team conducted a failed {{assault on the}} town {{on the basis that}} the audibly nearby Naval forces—which <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> were then in retreat—would bring support. The outcome left the Union forces with a combined 5 casualties and 21 wounded. Dialogue between officers following the conflict left the Union navy questioning the usefulness of gunboats in joint expedition settings in which they would not be capable of supporting themselves.|$|E
5|$|Imamura was {{up against}} a resourceful, {{resolute}} and aggressive opponent, who also had access to good intelligence. Allied Ultra codebreakers were reading the Japanese shipping codes, and, by 3 January 1943, Allied commanders knew in advance about the force that Adachi was planning to send from Rabaul to Lae, although <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> the force's ultimate destination. Blamey chose not to wait for this to become clear, but immediately ordered the 17th Infantry Brigade to move from Milne Bay to Wau on 4 January 1943. Its commander—Brigadier Murray Moten—was ordered to assume command of Kanga Force and defend Wau.|$|E
5|$|Later in Acts, Peter preached {{the gospel}} to the {{household}} of Cornelius the Centurion, a gentile. While he preached, the Holy Spirit {{fell on the}} gentiles, {{and they began to}} speak in tongues. The Jewish believers with Peter were amazed, and the household was water baptized. While the apostle Paul was in Ephesus, he found disciples there and discovered that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> of the existence of the Holy Spirit and had only received John the Baptist’s baptism. After baptizing them in Jesus’ name, Paul laid his hands on them, and they began to speak in tongues and prophesy.|$|E

5|$|According to Daniel Domscheit-Berg, {{a former}} WikiLeaks spokesperson, {{part of the}} WikiLeaks {{security}} concept was that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> who their sources were. The New York Times wrote in December 2010 that the U.S. government was trying to discover whether Assange had been a passive recipient of material from Manning, or had encouraged or helped her to extract the files; if the latter, Assange could be charged with conspiracy. Manning told Lamo in May 2010 that she had developed a working relationship with Assange, communicating directly with him using an encrypted Internet conferencing service, but knew little about him. WikiLeaks did not identify Manning as their source. Army investigators found pages of chats on Manning's computer between Manning and someone believed to be Julian Assange. Nicks writes that, despite this, no decisive evidence was found of Assange's offering Manning any direction.|$|E
5|$|Allied forces sent {{to disarm}} the Japanese and {{repatriate}} {{prisoners of war}} arrived in Indonesia in September 1945. In Semarang, {{this led to a}} conflict between Japanese forces and Indonesian rebels, that began on 15October; the Indonesians aimed to confiscate the Japanese weapons. Allied forces began landing in the city on 20October 1945; a small group was sent to Gedangan to speak with Soegijapranata. Concerned with civilian suffering, the vicar apostolic told the Allies that they must stop the battle; the Allies could not comply as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> the Japanese commander. Soegijapranata then contacted the Japanese and, that afternoon, brokered a cease-fire agreement in his office at Gedangan, despite Indonesian forces' firing at the Gurkha soldiers posted in front of the building.|$|E
5|$|Bushnell and Gene Lipkin, Atari's {{vice-president}} of sales, approached toy and electronic retailers to sell Home Pong, but were rejected. Retailers felt {{the product was}} too expensive and would not interest consumers. Atari contacted the Sears Sporting Goods department after noticing a Magnavox Odyssey advertisement in the sporting goods section of its catalog. Atari staff discussed {{the game with a}} representative, Tom Quinn, who expressed enthusiasm and offered the company an exclusive deal. Believing they could find more favorable terms elsewhere, Atari's executives declined and continued to pursue toy retailers. In January 1975, Atari staff set up a Home Pong booth at a toy trade fair in New York City, but was unsuccessful in soliciting orders {{due to the fact that}} <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> that they needed a private showing.|$|E

5|$|Carl Probyn {{witnessed}} the abduction of his stepdaughter from {{within sight of}} their home. He saw two people in a mid-sized gray carpossibly a Mercury Monarchmake a U-turn at the school bus stop where Dugard was waiting, and a woman forcing Dugard into the car. Probyn gave chase on a bicycle, {{but was unable to}} overtake the vehicle. Some of Dugard's classmates were also witnesses to the abduction. Initial suspects included Probyn and Slayton, though <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> each other and Slayton had only had a brief relationship with Terry in 1979, not knowing he had a child. When Dugard was rescued, Slayton expressed an interest in meeting his daughter and taking a paternity test. Dugard refused. Probyn took and passed several polygraph tests, and Slayton was also quickly cleared of suspicion.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 1 April 2013, the Facebook and Twitter {{accounts}} of Valor por Tamaulipas were shut down unexpectedly and without any explanation. A new page with the same name was created by other administrators, who said that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> {{what had happened to the}} original administrator but that they wanted to continue his work nonetheless. This raised concerns about who was actually working behind the scenes to keep the page running. Another page run by other users and with a similar name, Responsabilidad por Tamaulipas ("Responsibility for Tamaulipas"), posted on their page that Valor por Tamaulipas had only closed temporarily in order to improve the page and protect the administrator. They advised online users to ignore websites that posed as the original page.|$|E
5|$|The parity of zero is {{relevant}} to odd–even rationing, in which cars may drive or purchase gasoline on alternate days, according to the parity of the last digit in their license plates. Half of the numbers in a given range end in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 {{and the other half}} in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, so it makes sense to include 0 with the other even numbers. However, in 1977, a Paris rationing system led to confusion: on an odd-only day, the police avoided fining drivers whose plates ended in 0, because <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> whether 0 was even. To avoid such confusion, the relevant legislation sometimes stipulates that zero is even; such laws have been passed in New South Wales and Maryland.|$|E

5|$|The plane's {{landing gear}} {{mired in the}} water and mud, causing the plane to flip upside down and skid to a stop. Although the {{aircraft}} survived the landing nearly intact, Petty Officer Koga died instantly on impact, probably from a broken neck or a blunt-force blow to his head. Koga's wingmen, circling above, had orders to destroy any Zeros that crash-landed in enemy territory, but as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> if Koga was still alive, they could not bring themselves to strafe his plane. They decided to leave without firing on it. The Japanese submarine stationed off Akutan Island to pick up pilots searched for Koga in vain before being driven off by the destroyer USS Williamson.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{producers}} knew that Macfayden {{would leave the}} series, <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> when he would do so, and so the first two episodes were initially written without him. In either case, {{the producers}} created a new character, Adam Carter. In addition, the writers heavily researched the episodes; many of the story lines are based on truth. The producers also took information from advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The series was directed in five blocks of two episodes in each. Filming started in January 2004 and took place over six to seven months. Shooting took place almost entirely in London, England, with some scenes shot in a cross-English Channel ferry in the fifth episode.|$|E
5|$|When Marseille {{returned}} to his unit he asked his friends Franzisket, Clade and Schröer, whether they had heard {{what was happening to}} Jews and if perhaps something was underway that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> about. Franszisket recalled that he had heard Jews were being relocated to territory gained in the East but no more. Marseille recounted how he had attempted to ask questions about Jews who had vanished from his neighbourhood, including the family doctor that had delivered him at birth. Regardless of his hero status, when he attempted to bring the subject into any conversation with people who approached him, his enquiries were either met with awkward silences, or people changed the subject or even turned away. Franzisket noticed a change in Marseille's attitude toward his nation's cause. He never spoke of this with his comrades again.|$|E
