5|$|However, {{the greed}} of toll road {{operators}} resulted in diminishing upkeep, which forced the province to enact legislature allowing counties to assume {{ownership of the}} roads.

5|$|The {{hopes of}} the monarchists that Michael {{might be able}} <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> <b>the</b> throne {{following}} {{the election of the}} Constituent Assembly were overtaken by events.

The {{point of view of}} each chapter in the story is a limited {{perspective}} of a range of characters growing from nine, in the first novel, to thirty-one by the fifth. Three main stories interweave a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the rising threat of the supernatural Others in the northernmost reaches of Westeros, and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen, the deposed king's exiled daughter, <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> <b>the</b> Iron Throne.|$|E

5|$|At a Sunday {{church service}} in mid-December, in what Marshall {{believed}} {{was an attempt}} by other officials to force him <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> <b>the</b> presidency, a courier brought a message informing him that Wilson had died. Marshall was shocked, and rose to announce the news to the congregation. The ministers held a prayer, the congregation began singing hymns, and many people wept.

5|$|Bernard Lee died in January 1981, after filming {{had started}} on For Your Eyes Only, {{but before he}} could film his scenes as M, the head of MI6, as he had done in the {{previous}} eleven films of the series. Out of respect, no new actor was hired <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> <b>the</b> role and, instead, the script was re-written so that the character is said to be on leave, letting Chief of Staff Bill Tanner take over the role as acting head of MI6 and briefing Bond alongside the Minister of Defence.|$|E

5|$|From 1881 on, Pedro II's health began failing. He {{gradually}} {{withdrew from}} public affairs as time passed. Weary of being {{tied to a}} throne which he doubted would survive his death, he persevered out of duty and because there seemed no immediate alternative. Nor did his daughter and heir, Isabel, exhibit a desire <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> <b>the</b> crown. Both, however, were overwhelmingly beloved by the Brazilian people, who still supported the monarchy. The indifference towards the Imperial system by the Emperor and his daughter allowed a discontented republican minority to grow more audacious and to eventually launch the coup that overthrew the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Goebel died of {{his wounds}} on February 3, 1900.

Beckham, <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> <b>the</b> governorship; in exchange, Taylor and Marshall would receive immunity from prosecution in any actions they may have taken with regard to Goebel's assassination. The militia would withdraw from Frankfort, and the Goebel Election Law would be repealed and replaced with a fairer election law. Despite his allies' insistence, Taylor refused to sign the agreement.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, Nikolai Zaremba {{resigned}} from the directorship of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory.
