5|$|During {{the time}} that the wing had a flying mission, the wing {{deployed}} to many locations around the globe to assist in missions for the Air Force. In 1961, the wing deployed to France during the Berlin Crisis. Twenty eight years later, the wing deployed to Panama during Operation Coronet Nighthawk. It also participated in Operation Northern Watch, helping to patrol the No-Fly Zone north of the 36th parallel in Iraq. During the 11 September attacks, the 102d Fighter Wing deployed the first Air Force aircraft <b>toward</b> <b>New</b> York City, but they arrived too late to stop the attacks.|$|E
5|$|In late 1775, Benjamin Church, the Director General, {{assigned}} McKnight to the Putnam House building, {{one of six}} hospitals of the army's Hospital Department in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He {{remained in}} that division, which supported Washington's army, until, {{during a period of}} great scarcity of medical and surgical supplies for the sick and wounded, McKnight went with other surgeons and physicians to North Castle, New York with Washington's army when the Battle of White Plains began in October 1776. The Continental Army lost the battle, and the British took Fort Washington and Fort Lee, which pushed Washington's ragged army south <b>toward</b> <b>New</b> Jersey in December 1776, which {{set the stage for the}} Battle of Trenton.|$|E
5|$|McClellan {{resigned}} {{his commission}} January 16, 1857, and, capitalizing on {{his experience with}} railroad assessment, became chief engineer {{and vice president of}} the Illinois Central Railroad, and then president of the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad in 1860. He performed well in both jobs, expanding the Illinois Central <b>toward</b> <b>New</b> Orleans and helping the Ohio and Mississippi recover from the Panic of 1857. Despite his successes and lucrative salary ($10,000 per year), he was frustrated with civilian employment and continued to study classical military strategy assiduously. During the Utah War against the Mormons, he considered rejoining the Army. He also considered service as a filibuster in support of Benito Juárez in Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Once {{out of the}} village, NY17A and NY94 {{begin to}} climb again, this time {{offering}} some panoramic views to the north, {{all the way to}} the Shawangunk Ridge and even the Catskill Mountains beyond them in clear enough weather. The road is surprisingly little developed in this area, with only one gas station between Florida and Warwick, its next stop, which likewise presents itself after a descent. Again, NY17A and NY94 serve as the bustling village's main street, longer this time and with many upscale boutiques in evidence. Many historic buildings line the road through Warwick. Near the southern end of the village, the two roads split, with NY94 continuing <b>toward</b> <b>New</b> Jersey while NY17A goes eastward.|$|E
5|$|Teaneck {{is split}} {{east and west}} by {{railroad}} tracks, which currently provide freight service by CSX Transportation. Until 1959, passenger train service was provided on these same tracks by the West Shore Railroad, with Teaneck stations at Cedar Lane and West Englewood Avenue. Commuter service was available from these stations, with 44 passenger trains operating daily to and from Weehawken, where Hudson River ferry service was available to New York City at 42nd Street and at the Financial District in Lower Manhattan. Train service from Teaneck was also available north to Albany, along the west shore of the river. Efforts are ongoing to restore some passenger train service on this line for commuters heading <b>toward</b> <b>New</b> York City, including extension of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail service via the Northern Branch to Englewood or Tenafly.|$|E
5|$|Unable to trap Lafayette, the British marched from Philadelphia <b>toward</b> <b>New</b> York; the Continental Army, {{including}} Lafayette, {{followed and}} finally attacked at Monmouth Courthouse, in central New Jersey. At Monmouth, Washington appointed General Charles Lee {{to lead the}} attacking force. On 28 June, Lee moved against the British flank; however, soon after fighting began, he gave conflicting orders, causing chaos in the American ranks. Lafayette {{sent a message to}} Washington to urge him to the front; upon his arrival he found Lee's men in retreat. Washington relieved Lee, took command, and rallied the American force. After suffering significant casualties at Monmouth, the British withdrew in the night, and successfully reached New York.|$|E

5|$|MD 410 {{continues}} east on Riverdale Road {{then turns}} southeast onto Veterans Parkway, a four-lane divided highway, while Riverdale Road continues <b>toward</b> <b>New</b> Carrollton. The highway briefly enters {{the city of}} New Carrollton around its intersection with MD 450 (Annapolis Road). MD 410 continues south and intersects Ellin Road before passing through a diamond interchange with US 50 (John Hanson Highway). The highway crosses over the Amtrak Northeast Corridor, MARC's Penn Line, and the Washington Metro's Orange Line. South of the railroad tracks, MD 410 reaches its eastern terminus at Pennsy Drive, which leads to Ardwick Ardmore Road and the primary entrance to New Carrollton Station, which serves as the eastern terminus of the Orange Line and hosts MARC and Amtrak service. Secondary access to the station is provided by Ellin Road north of US 50.|$|E
5|$|Meeting on {{the third}} day of the special session, Democratic factions within the General Assembly reached a {{compromise}} budget. That tentative budget proposed an increase in the state sales tax from 6% to 7%, which was estimated to generate an additional $1.1 billion in revenue. The plan also included a requirement to use half of that for direct relief <b>toward</b> <b>New</b> Jersey's property tax—highest of all states. The plan also called for the same dedicated purpose for all of the money raised by this sales tax increase in subsequent years. The new budget law included a provision for a constitutional amendment which was required, like all such amendments in the state, to be approved in an Election Day referendum. On November 7, 2006, New Jersey voters approved this measure by a two to one margin statewide.|$|E
5|$|On June 28, Washington {{learned that}} the British fleet had set sail from Halifax on June 9 and were heading <b>toward</b> <b>New</b> York. On June 29, signals were sent from men {{stationed}} on Staten Island, indicating that the British fleet had appeared. Within a few hours, 45 British ships dropped anchor in Lower New York Bay. Less than a week later, there were 130 ships off Staten Island {{under the command of}} Richard Howe, the brother of the general. The population of New York went into panic {{at the sight of the}} British ships; alarms went off and troops immediately rushed to their posts. On July 2, British troops began to land on Staten Island. The continental regulars on the island took a few shots at them before fleeing, and the citizens' militia switched over to the British side.|$|E

5|$|The 1804 Snow {{hurricane}} (also {{known as}} the Storm of October1804) was the first tropical cyclone in recorded history known to produce snowfall, with Hurricane Ginny in 1963 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012 being the next such systems to do so. An unusual late-season storm in 1804, it yielded vast amounts of snow, rain, and powerful winds across the northeastern United States. Prior to its approach towards the East Coast of the United States, it passed through the Caribbean Sea on 4October, and later emerged near Georgetown, South Carolina. By early on 9 October, a trough near the Virginia Capes turned the disturbance <b>toward</b> <b>New</b> England. Soon thereafter, the hurricane's abundant moisture clashed with an influx of cold Canadian air, leading to the deepening of the resulting pressure gradient and provoking inland intensification. While situated over Massachusetts, it attained its peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), undergoing an extratropical transition. Even as it drifted towards the Canadian maritimes, consequently gradually weakening, precipitation persisted for another {{two days before the}} snowstorm finally subsided on 11October.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} storm {{of the season}} was Hurricane Bob, {{which at the time}} was among the ten costliest United States hurricanes. After brushing the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Long Island in New York, the hurricane made landfall on Rhode Island. It caused $1.5billion in damage (1991USD), mostly in Massachusetts, and 17fatalities. The strongest hurricane of the season was Claudette, which reached peak winds of 135mph (215km/h) near Bermuda. It passed near the island but did not cause any damage. Tropical Storm Fabian was the only tropical storm to move over or near Cuba or Florida, producing heavy rainfall but no damage. Hurricane Grace, the final named storm of the season, provided the energy that {{led to the development of}} a powerful nor'easter known as the Perfect Storm. Originating from an extratropical storm, the Perfect Storm intensified while moving westward <b>toward</b> <b>New</b> England, leaving $200million in damage and causing coastal damage from Puerto Rico to Florida and northward through Canada. It later transitioned into a hurricane over the Gulf Stream, finally dissipating over Nova Scotia on November2.|$|E
5|$|When Hurricane Able was {{expected}} {{to move through the}} Bahamas, people executed standard preparations such as securing windows and bringing ships to harbor. One cruise liner diverted its route from the Bahamas <b>toward</b> <b>New</b> York. In Florida, the U.S. Air Force made preliminary plans to move planes. Ultimately, the hurricane spared the region. Further north, the United States Weather Bureau issued northeast storm warnings from Morehead City, North Carolina to the Eastern Shore of Virginia. There, the hurricane ended up bringing light winds and rough waves. Moderate precipitation occurred along the North Carolina coast. In southern New England, Able dropped 35inches (75125mm) of rainfall, with a peak of 6.89inches (175mm) in Beechwood, Massachusetts. Flooding was reported in portions of New York City. The resulting slick roads from the rains caused nine traffic fatalities across New England. The storm produced 55mph (90km/h) gusts in Nantucket and Cape Cod, along with high tides and waves. Offshore, the waves damaged a freighter headed for Florida.|$|E

5|$|During World WarII, the RAAF {{established}} several {{operational training}} units (OTUs) to convert recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft, and to add fighting techniques to the flying skills {{they had already}} learned. No.2 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit (No.2 OTU) was formed on 2April 1942 at Port Pirie, South Australia. Its inaugural commanding officer was Wing Commander Peter Jeffrey, a fighter ace who had led No.3 Squadron in North Africa. Jeffrey had recently brought on line Nos.75 and 76 Squadrons, two {{of the first three}} fighter units raised to help defend northern Australia as the Japanese advanced <b>toward</b> <b>New</b> Guinea. His team of instructors at No.2OTU included fellow aces from the North African campaign, Clive Caldwell and Wilf Arthur. Originally equipped with CAC Wirraways and Fairey Battles, the unit's complement was augmented by P-40 Kittyhawks, Vultee Vengeances, Avro Ansons, CAC Boomerangs, Supermarine Spitfires and Airspeed Oxfords after it relocated to RAAF Station Mildura, Victoria, in May. By September 1942, its fleet of aircraft included nine of the 106 Kittyhawks the RAAF had on hand at the time. During November, No.2OTU conducted comparative trials that pitted a Spitfire MkV against a P-40E; the final report of these trials judged that although the Spitfire had superior performance according to most criteria, the P-40E was also a useful design.|$|E
