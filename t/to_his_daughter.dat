5|$|In {{the middle}} of this confrontation, Henry {{unexpectedly}} fell ill and died near Lyons-la-Forêt. It is uncertain what, if anything, Henry said about the succession before his death. Contemporary chronicler accounts were coloured by subsequent events.

5|$|Rupert D'Oyly Carte {{refreshed}} {{the opera}} company's productions and added London seasons, beginning in 1919, {{as well as}} provincial and foreign tours. In 1948 Rupert died, leaving a strong company <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>daughter</b> Bridget D'Oyly Carte. However, the rising costs of mounting professional light opera without any government support eventually became {{too much for the}} company. Bridget was forced to close the company in 1982. Nevertheless, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond, and Carte's vision of wholesome light operas that celebrate Great Britain endures.|$|E
