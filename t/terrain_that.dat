5|$|Due to {{its size}} and {{geologic}} features such as the Balcones Fault, Texas contains diverse landscapes that resemble both the U.S. Southern and Southwestern regions. Although Texas is popularly associated with the U.S. southwestern deserts, less than 10% of Texas' land area is desert. Most of the population centers are located in areas of former prairies, grasslands, forests, and the coastline. Traveling from east to west, one can observe <b>terrain</b> <b>that</b> ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods, to rolling plains and rugged hills, and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend.|$|E
5|$|On June 27, {{officials}} {{announced that the}} estimated containment date had been delayed until July 7. According to a Forest Service Spokesman, the final 7% of the perimeter was in extremely rough <b>terrain</b> <b>that</b> was close to impossible for hand crews or bulldozers to reach. Due {{to the difficulty of}} access the fire remained only 96% contained on July 9 and the estimated containment date was pushed back to July 21. Due to favorable conditions, on July 12, the Sherpa fire was 100% contained ahead of schedule. Because of the threat of flare ups within the burn area, patrols continued for several days.|$|E

50|$|Regional {{metamorphic}} UHP terrains exposed on Earth's surface provide considerable {{information that}} is not available from xenoliths. Integrated study by structural geologists, petrologists, and geochronologists has provided considerable data on how the rocks deformed, the pressures and temperatures of metamorphism, and how the deformation and metamorphism varied {{as a function of}} space and time. It has been postulated <b>that</b> small UHP <b>terrains</b> <b>that</b> underwent short periods of metamorphism formed early during continent subduction, whereas giant UHP <b>terrains</b> <b>that</b> underwent long periods of metamorphism formed late during continent collision.|$|R

5|$|M-79 starts {{south of}} Hastings at a {{three-way}} intersection with M-37 in Hastings Township. The trunkline runs east and parallel to {{a section of}} the Thornapple River through wooded <b>terrain</b> <b>that</b> is interspersed with farm fields. South of Thornapple Lake, M-79 angles southeasterly moving from Quimby Road to Scott Road running parallel to the Thornapple River again into the community of Nashville. M-79 meets M-66 and turns south along the latter highway's route along Main and Durkee streets through the community. South of town in Maple Grove Township, M-79 separates from M-66 and turns east along Lawrence Road. Outside of Charlotte, M-79 curves southeast to transition to Lawrence Avenue through town. The eastern terminus is at an intersection with Cochran Avenue, which carries BLI-69 and M-50.|$|E
5|$|The Athenians {{and their}} allies chose a {{location}} for the battle, with marshes and mountainous <b>terrain,</b> <b>that</b> prevented the Persian cavalry from joining the main Persian army. Miltiades, the Athenian general, ordered a general attack against the Persian infantry-bowmen. He reinforced his flanks, luring the Persians' best fighters into his center. The inward wheeling flanks enveloped the Persians, routing them. The Persian army broke in panic towards their ships, and large numbers were slaughtered. The defeat at Marathon {{marked the end of}} the first Persian invasion of Greece, and the Persian force retreated to Asia. Darius then began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition. After Darius died, his son Xerxes I restarted the preparations for a second invasion of Greece, which finally began in 480 BC.|$|E
5|$|The James Bay {{hydroelectric}} dam complex contains several {{relatively short}} 735kV power lines that send electricity to three principal substations, ordered from west to east: Radisson, Chissibi, and Lemoyne. From these substations, six 735kV power lines traverse the vast expanses of taiga and boreal forest in clear-cut stretches of land; this shows up clearly in aerial photos. The <b>terrain</b> <b>that</b> the power lines cross {{is for the}} most part not mountainous, but smooth and replete with lakes. Generally, four of the lines runs together in two pairs and the other two run solo, although the two single lines sometimes do run in a pair. Two intermediate 735kV power lines, one in the north and one in the south, connect all six power lines along their path to southern Quebec.|$|E

5|$|Training {{began in}} early October in Wales and was {{designed}} to be extremely arduous, not only to ensure that those who took part were at the peak of their physical and mental fitness, but also to eliminate any men unable to cope with the long marches and difficult <b>terrain</b> <b>that</b> would be encountered during the operation. When this portion of the training had been completed, the sappers were then transferred to the area around Fort William in Scotland, where they were familiarised with a hydroelectric plant similar in design to the one in Norway, and received training on {{the most efficient way to}} plant explosives in the Norsk Hydro plant to cause maximum damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{strategy of}} Heraclius, {{to destroy the}} Muslim troops in Syria, needed a rapid and quick deployment, but the commanders on the ground never displayed these qualities. Ironically, on the field at Yarmouk, Khalid carried out on a small tactical scale what Heraclius had planned on a grand strategic scale: by rapidly deploying and manoeuvering his forces, Khalid was able to temporarily concentrate sufficient forces at specific locations on the field to defeat the larger Byzantine army in detail. Vahan {{was never able to}} make his numerical superiority count, perhaps because of the unfavorable <b>terrain</b> <b>that</b> prevented large-scale deployment. However, at no point did Vahan attempt to concentrate a superior force to achieve a critical breakthrough. Although he was on the offensive 5 days out of the six, his battle line remained remarkably static. This all stands {{in stark contrast to the}} very successful offensive plan that Khalid carried out on the final day, when he reorganised virtually all his cavalry and committed them to a grand manoeuvre that won the battle.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1943, the 3rd Battalion {{landed at}} Cape Torokina {{with the rest}} of 3rd Marines, just east of the Koromokina River. While {{resistance}} was extremely light, the rough surf and dense jungle (which in many places extended {{all the way to the}} water) resulted in numerous landing craft being lost or damaged beyond repair. For the next two weeks, the battalion helped construct a series of trails that linked the beachhead with the advancing units, and made supply much easier. On 16 November the battalion reached the Numa Numa Trail and began probing for Japanese units On 18 November after a sharp firefight near a Japanese roadblock the battalion recovered a Japanese map with valuable intelligence on Japanese defenses. From 19–21 November 3rd Battalion continued probing for Japanese units, which had been identified as elements of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, and engaging in sporadic firefights. In the lead-up to the Battle of Piva Forks, 3rd Battalion was able to seize critical high <b>terrain</b> <b>that</b> would give the Marines the advantage in the upcoming fight. The actual battle, from 22–26 November, saw some of the most vicious close combat experienced in the Pacific War as of that date. 3rd Battalion additionally suffered many casualties from unusually accurate Japanese mortar and artillery fire. Two days later, after 27 days of continuous action, 3rd Battalion was moved to a relatively quiet sector on the 3rd Division's flank where it remained for the remainder of the operation.|$|E

25|$|Eberth and {{the other}} {{researchers}} considered Hilda a prime site for a continuous bonebed for two reasons, one related to its history, one related to its present geography.

Secondly, the modern Hilda area lacks the rough badland <b>terrain</b> <b>that</b> breaks up many probably equivalent deposits in Dinosaur Provincial Park.|$|E

25|$|Peaceful {{penetration}} {{relied on}} the patrols infiltrating the German outposts, and approaching them from behind. As a result, {{one of the main}} requirements for successful peaceful penetration is that the terrain provide good cover (e.g. covered approaches such as ditches), or have enough ground cover (trees, grasses, etc.). As a result, it was only after the German Spring Offensive forced the Allies out of the previously fought over terrain into <b>terrain</b> <b>that</b> had not been damaged by artillery that peaceful penetration became feasible.|$|E
