40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop {{parallel}} hybrid <b>tractor.</b> The hybrid <b>tractor</b> was constructed by adding major components of a hybrid driving system on a <b>tractor.</b> The <b>tractor</b> has 71 kW engine power and the major components included an EMG (electric motor/generator), an inverter, batteries, a battery management system (BMS), and a hybrid control unit (HCU). The hybrid <b>tractor</b> had three control modes: idle, power assist, and battery charge and it were determined by the workload which estimated by measuring engine rotational speed. Performance of the hybrid <b>tractor</b> was evaluated through the field tests of plowing. Performance tests were conducted by comparing the hybrid <b>tractor</b> and the conventional one, and one hybrid <b>tractor</b> was used for the experiment. The hybrid <b>tractor</b> used the hybrid system for the control of EMG, and the conventional <b>tractor</b> was driven by the engine not using the hybrid system. Performances of the hybrid <b>tractor</b> and the conventional <b>tractor</b> were similar at M 2 which is low speed condition and it could work with low load, but the performance of the hybrid <b>tractor</b> was better than one of the conventional <b>tractor</b> at higher load condition (M 3, M 4). Fuel efficiency of the hybrid <b>tractor</b> at M 2 was similar with the one of the conventional <b>tractor,</b> but it was lower at M 3 and M 4 than the one of the conventional <b>tractor</b> by 74 %. Considering all results of this study, the developed parallel hybrid <b>tractor</b> is feasible to improve plowing performance of the conventional <b>tractor...</b>|$|R

5|$|When the war ended, Holt's planned {{expansion}} to {{meet the}} military's needs was no longer needed. The company was left in a difficult situation. The types of <b>tractors</b> needed by the military were {{very different from what}} farmers needed. Their situation was worsened as artillery <b>tractors</b> were brought back from Europe, depressing prices for new equipment and Holt's unsold inventory of military <b>tractors.</b> The company moved to focus less on agricultural machinery and more on producing road-building equipment. To keep the company afloat, they borrowed heavily.|$|E

25|$|Fendt, {{part of the}} AGCO corporation, {{has also}} {{been working on a}} driverless <b>tractor.</b> In 2011 in Hanover at the Agritechnica show, Fendt {{presented}} their driverless <b>tractor</b> model called the GuideConnect. The GuideConnect is a <b>tractor</b> programmed to mirror the movements of another <b>tractor.</b> An operator-driven <b>tractor</b> maneuvers through a field or through crops and is followed by a driverless <b>tractor.</b> Because the first <b>tractor</b> has a driver, he or she can manually steer to avoid obstacles with the driverless <b>tractor</b> following. Instead of focusing on a completely independent piece of technology, Fendt made GuideConnect to work together with operator-controlled machinery. GuideConnect is connected by satellite navigation and radio to the operator-driven <b>tractor.</b> The two perform as one unit. The one with the driver leads while the one without the driver follows.|$|R

For a short time, VAT imported and marketed clearing <b>tractors</b> produced by Italian firm Ansaldo-Fossati. Although there was demand {{for this type of}} vehicle, they sold poorly because their price was considered inconsistent with their technical quality; only a few units were delivered in 1953.|$|E
5|$|The Cab {{and drive}} axle {{portion of a}} large {{capacity}} truck and trailer. Since {{the primary purpose of}} the Cab is to pull the trailer, it is rightly referred to as a tractor. The various kinds of <b>tractors</b> are Yard, Day, and Sleepers.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{industrial}} development quickened. New technology increased farm productivity through automation of feedlots for hogs and cattle, machine milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings. Planting became more specialized with hybridization {{of corn and}} wheat, {{and the use of}} farm machinery such as <b>tractors</b> and combines became the norm. University of Minnesota professor Norman Borlaug contributed to these developments as part of the Green Revolution. Suburban development accelerated due to increased postwar housing demand and convenient transportation. Increased mobility, in turn, enabled more specialized jobs.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tractor</b> {{stability}} predominantly determines operatorâs safety. For a <b>tractor</b> parking on lateral slopes, overturning accidents {{have been}} frequently discussed using mathematical models. While the existing static models remarkably contribute <b>tractor</b> overturning mechanisms, {{few of them}} have considered the stability {{from the perspective of}} <b>tractor</b> sideslip. In our study, a relatively precise quasiâstatic model presented recently was adopted as the base model. We expanded it by introducing potential <b>tractor</b> sideslips. While the original model pointed out the lateral slope angle as the main factor influencing <b>tractor</b> overturns, we investigated <b>tractor</b> slipping stability under the influences of the slope angle and the coefficient of friction. The dimensional parameters of the example <b>tractor</b> for simulation were set the same as those in the original work. It was found that the allowable friction forces of both the front and rear tires primarily depended on the coefficient of friction rather than the slope angle. By comparing the surfaces of the allowable friction forces and the corresponding friction forces, <b>tractor</b> slipping thresholds for the front and rear tires were identified. Caution areas implying certain ground conditions that will definitely cause <b>tractor</b> sideslip were marked accordingly. The results shown in this study provide a relatively comprehensive way to understand <b>tractor</b> static stability when both <b>tractor</b> sideslip and overturn are concerned...|$|R

50|$|Schloemer was not {{satisfied}} with the current method of plowing the farm fields so went about conceiving, with his son Andrew, a self-powered <b>tractor</b> to improve the situation. The new Schloemer <b>tractor</b> they patented was made with two plows, one on each end of the <b>tractor.</b> The back plow was lowered into the ground when going across the field to plow the dirt over. When the <b>tractor</b> {{reached the end of the}} field the plow was raised by a lever. Then the <b>tractor</b> was lined up into the next row without turning it around. The other plow on the opposite end of the <b>tractor</b> was lowered by a lever and the plowing commenced going back across the field. This procedure continued for plowing the complete field without once turning the <b>tractor</b> around. The Schloemer non-turning gasoline <b>tractor</b> was made in 1896, and has been claimed as the first gasoline <b>tractor</b> ever made, although John Froelich of Iowa's 1892 machine is also credited with this achievement. The production of Schloemer's <b>tractor</b> was held up because of financial problems.|$|R
