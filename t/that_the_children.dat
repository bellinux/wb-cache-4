5|$|Another survivor, Radomir Krnjajić, {{recalled}} {{that they were}} fed a variety of foods, including pumpkin soup, cucumbers, beets and similar vegetables, and sometimes received a little macaroni or beans, but very little bread. The historian Ivan Fumić concludes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> were systematically punished for various infractions, and were treated harshly by the Ustaše {{and the majority of}} the nuns. Some of the nuns at the camp, however, did show love and attention to the children. Gojko Knežević, another camp survivor, recounted many years later that the nuns beat the children with birch branches dipped in salt water or vinegar.|$|E
30|$|Regarding the {{bullying}} situations <b>the</b> <b>children</b> experienced, 82.5 % (n[*]=[*] 231) of <b>the</b> caregivers said <b>that</b> {{their child}} had already witnessed situations of bullying and 62.1 % (n[*]=[*] 174) {{reported that their}} child had already {{been a victim of}} bullying at school.

Adeka's older brother had been killed in London, ensuring Solomon became chief of the tribe whose lands held massive amounts of oil: as he was an addict, these rights were signed away in favour of Hulbert Linck. Linck was killed by the CIA during the raid on the house.|$|E
5|$|Estianty and Dhani {{divorced}} on September 23, 2008. The {{separation of}} the couple, who {{had been married for}} twelve years and had three sons, Ahmad Al Ghazali, El Jallaludin Rumi, and Ahmad Abdul Qodir Jaelani, was not amicable; Estianty filed a police complaint accusing Dhani of abuse, and Dhani refused to give Estianty custody of their children, appealing to the Supreme Court of Indonesia after several lower courts ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> were Estianty's. In 2011 Dhani was reportedly in a relationship with Mulan and had a child with her, and Dhani gave Estianty visitation rights in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In Reformed theology, baptism is {{the sacrament}} of {{initiation}} into the visible church, or body of people who publicly claim faith in Christ. Baptism also signifies regeneration and remission of sin. Reformed Christians believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> of those who express faith in Christ should be baptized. Because baptism {{is believed to be}} beneficial only to those who have faith in Christ, infants are baptized {{on the basis of the}} promise of faith which will come to fruition later in life.|$|E
50|$|Differences {{in values}} cause parents to {{interpret}} different actions in different ways. Asking questions {{is seen by}} many European American parents as a sign <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> is smart. Italian parents, who value social and emotional competence, believe that asking questions is a sign <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> has good interpersonal skills. Dutch parents, who value independence, view asking questions negatively, as a sign <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> is not independent. Indigenous American parents often try to encourage curiosity in their children. Many use a permissive parenting style <b>that</b> enables <b>the</b> <b>child</b> to explore and learn through observation {{of the world around}} it.|$|R

5|$|Prior to abandoning Juana Ibarguren, Juan Duarte {{had been}} her sole means of support. Biographer John Barnes writes that after this abandonment, all Duarte left to the family was a {{document}} declaring <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> were his, thus enabling them to use the Duarte surname. Soon after, Juana moved her children to a one-room apartment in Junín. To pay the rent on their single-roomed home, mother and daughters took up jobs as cooks in the houses of the local estancias.|$|E
5|$|Sól is {{referenced}} in the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, {{where she}} is introduced in chapter 8 in a quote from stanza 5 of Völuspá. In chapter 11 of Gylfaginning, Gangleri (described as King Gylfi in disguise) asks the enthroned figure of High how the sun and moon are steered. High describes that Sól {{is one of the}} two children of Mundilfari, and states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> were so beautiful they were named after the sun (Sól) and the moon (Máni). Mundilfari has Sól married to a man named Glenr.|$|E
5|$|The NDH {{government}} struck {{upon the}} idea of trying to re-educate these children to become something akin to an Ustaše version of the Hitler Youth, thereby turning them against their Serb parents. The regime saw this as a more effective way of placing pressure on the Yugoslav Partisan movement than killing the children outright. However, the NDH regime had not made any arrangements to implement this idea, so {{the establishment of a}} children's camp was done in haste, especially as there was strong pressure to do something for the children. NDH regime propaganda advanced the idea <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> were being liberated from slavery {{at the hands of the}} Partisans.|$|E

5|$|The {{children}} {{were put into}} {{the care of a}} nanny, as was usual in upper-class families at the time. The first nanny was dismissed for insolence and the second for abusing the children. This second woman, anxious to suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> preferred her to anyone else, would pinch Edward and Albert whenever they were about to be presented to their parents so that they would start crying and be speedily returned to her. On discovery, she was replaced by her effective and much-loved assistant, Charlotte Bill.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. In the opening shot of the episode, the bus <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> travel in to the field trip had to vibrate up and down {{to give the impression}} that it did not have bumpers and that it was falling apart. Scott said it was difficult to animate the scene because of the vibrating and the backgrounds panning. Milhouse's tutor in the episode is based on the American actor Tony Randall.|$|E

In his own travel book, Salten did not boast about this; only when describing his visit to a “Negro college” of Atlanta, he mentions passingly <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> praised his books.|$|E

5|$|When {{asked why}} she did not {{immediately}} inform the police of Lucan's presence, Susan Maxwell-Scott said {{she had not seen}} any newspapers or television news, or listened to any radio broadcasts that might have warned her of the importance of his visit. Meanwhile, Lucan's children were taken by their aunt, Lady Sarah Gibbs, to her home in Guilsborough, Northamptonshire, where they would remain for several weeks. On the day Veronica Lucan was discharged from hospital, a High Court hearing confirmed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> could return to live with her. Repeated press intrusions later forced the family to move to a friend's home in Plymouth.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{was born}} on 31 July 1902 in Bellevue Hill, Sydney, Australia, the second of three {{children}} to Walter Allen, a lawyer, and his wife Marguerite (Pearl), née Lamb, {{the daughter of a}} Queensland Minister of Lands. Later rumours suggested that Allen's real father may have been the Middlesex cricketer Pelham Warner, who supported Allen in his cricket career. Both of Allen's parents had roots in England as well as Australia. In 1909, when Allen was six years old, his family moved to London—hoping <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> would benefit from an English education—where they initially lived in a flat before moving to various country villages. Finding that they enjoyed England, the family abandoned plans to return to Australia.|$|E
40|$|POLICY: [NEW] The Indiana Department of Child Services (DCS) will {{partner with}} the {{resource}} family of a child in out-of-home care to allow <b>the</b> <b>child</b> to participate in extracurricular activities.

5|$|Bamber {{visited the}} farm {{on the evening}} of Tuesday, 6 August. He told the court that his parents {{suggested}} to Sheila that evening that the boys be placed in day-time foster care with a local family. Bamber said Sheila did not seem bothered by the suggestion and had simply said she would rather stay in London. The boys had been in foster care before, although in London rather than near White House Farm, and it had not appeared to cause a problem for Sheila. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Ferguson, told the Court of Appeal in 2002 that any suggestion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> be removed from her care would have provoked a strong reaction from Sheila, but that she might have welcomed daytime help.|$|E
5|$|ETS, whose {{prestige}} {{enhanced the}} credibility of its findings, conducted two landmark summative evaluations in 1970 and 1971, demonstrating that Sesame Street had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies illustrated the early educational effects of Sesame Street, and have been cited in other studies {{of the effects of}} television on young children. ETS reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> who watched the show most learned the most, and achieved better results in letter-recognition skills. Three-year-olds who watched regularly scored higher than five-year-olds who did not; children from low-income households who were regular viewers scored higher than children from higher-income households who watched the show less frequently. Similar results occurred in children from non-English-speaking homes. Although adult supervision was not required for children to learn using the material presented, children who watched and discussed the program with their parents gained more skills than those who did not. Children viewing the show in an informal home setting learned as much as children who watched it at school under a teacher's supervision. Regular viewers adjusted better to the school environment than non-viewers. They also had a more positive attitude toward school and better peer relations than non-viewers.|$|E
5|$|IQ tests {{generally}} are reliable enough {{that most people}} ages ten and older have similar IQ scores throughout life. Still, some individuals score very differently when taking the same test at different times or when taking more than one kind of IQ test at the same age. For example, many children in the famous longitudinal Genetic Studies of Genius begun in 1921 by Lewis Terman showed declines in IQ as they grew up. Terman recruited school pupils based on referrals from teachers, and gave them his Stanford–Binet IQ test. Children with an IQ above 140 by that test {{were included in the}} study. There were 643 children in the main study group. When the students who could be contacted again (503 students) were retested at high school age, they were found to have dropped 9 IQ points on average in Stanford–Binet IQ. More than two dozen children dropped by 15 IQ points and six by 25 points or more. Yet parents of those children thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> were still as bright as ever, or even brighter.|$|E
