5|$|Following Unforgiven, Triple H had {{a celebration}} thrown in his honor, {{complete}} with six women, confetti, streamers {{and a giant}} cake. Randy Orton, however, sought revenge, as he attacked all three Evolution members, as {{he came out of}} the giant cake, which was placed in the center of the ring, and humiliated the group. Orton was however ineligible to face Triple H at Taboo <b>Tuesday</b> <b>for</b> the World Heavyweight Championship, as he was unable to win a match against Batista, which would have given Orton a championship match. On the October 4, 2004 edition of Raw, three candidates were named as potential contenders for Triple H's World Heavyweight Championship at Taboo Tuesday; Chris Benoit and Edge were revealed as two of the candidates. Shawn Michaels, however, competed in a qualifying match, which it saw him defeat Christian, to become the third candidate. On the October 18 edition of Raw, a Triple Threat match was scheduled between Michaels, Benoit and Edge, which Edge won after he pinned Benoit by using the ropes for leverage. During the match, Michaels injured his knee, and it was later revealed that he tore his meniscus.

25|$|In the UK, Good Friday was {{historically}} {{a common}} law holiday and is recognised {{as an official}} public holiday (a.k.a. Bank Holiday). All state schools are closed and most businesses treat it as a holiday for staff; however, many retail stores now remain open. Government services in Northern Ireland operate as normal on Good Friday, substituting Easter <b>Tuesday</b> <b>for</b> the holiday.|$|E
25|$|This {{situation}} has been {{complicated by the}} most recent revision of the Holidays Act. The holiday is Mondayised only if the employee would not usually work on weekends. For example, an office worker who works only Monday to Friday would get to the Statutory holidays on the Monday (or <b>Tuesday</b> <b>for</b> days that fell on Sundays). But an employee who usually worked Saturdays would not get the Monday holiday as they did not work on the Saturday.|$|E

500|$|The {{main event}} at Taboo Tuesday was a match between Randy Orton and Ric Flair where the online fan vote would {{determine}} whether the match was a steel cage match, a Falls Count Anywhere match, or a submission match. On the September 27, 2004, episode of Raw — one of WWE's primary television programs — Orton was {{given an opportunity to}} face Triple H at Taboo <b>Tuesday</b> <b>for</b> the World Heavyweight Championship if he was able to win a match against Batista, but {{he was not able to}} do so due to interference from Flair. This led to Orton blaming his loss on Flair. Orton commented on everything Flair had accomplished in WWE and criticized him for calling Triple H [...] "the greatest wrestler of all". Flair responded to Orton's comments, asserting that despite Orton's claim of being a [...] "Legend Killer", wrestlers whom he had defeated such as Shawn Michaels and Mick Foley are not truly legends and therefore do not make Orton a true [...] "Legend Killer". Flair also announced that he and Orton would meet in a match at Taboo Tuesday and the fans would have the opportunity to choose what type of match they would compete in.|$|E
500|$|On Friday morning 21 June, seven {{prisoners were}} brought to the bar on a similar charge as on Tuesday (breaking into the house of Rebecca Waddelow in Littleport and {{stealing}} personal property and money). The prisoners all pleaded not guilty. Mr Gurney addressed the jury explaining that these were the same persons indicted on <b>Tuesday</b> <b>for</b> the same offence. He explained to the jury that the earlier indictment incorrectly described the house to be the property of Rebecca Waddelow, leading to the prisoners' acquittal. He also explained that in the original indictment, other persons had been charged, but as these other persons had since been convicted of capital offences, they had been removed from the indictment. The witness were all brought forward again and made their statements. They said much the same as previously, though this took much of the day. In summing up, Mr Abbott went on a length closing with [...] "the duty which it belonged to them [...] to execute – confident that, from experience which the court had now of them, their verdict would be such as good sense would dictate, and the public justice of the country require". It took the jury fiveminutes to find Walker, Butcher and Crow guilty and Nicholas, Wilson and Jefferson not guilty.|$|E

Massaro made her in-ring debut on the August 29 episode of Raw, in losing effort to Victoria. On the September 5 episode of Raw, Massaro was defeated by the evil Wilson due to interference from Victoria and Candice.

After the match, The duo were attacked by The Vince Devils. The feud continued into WWE Homecoming, where Stratus and Massaro defeated Wilson, Candice, and Victoria in the first ever three on two Bra and Panties match by stripping all three of their opponents.
