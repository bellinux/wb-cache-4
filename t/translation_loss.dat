40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} information {{content of the}} translation information resulting from exchange rate fluctuations. Two hypotheses are examined. The dollar movement hypotheses investigate {{whether there is a}} positive relationship between security valuation and the translation information and whether the market assigns different weights to <b>translation</b> gains and <b>losses</b> in both the depreciating and appreciating exchange rate environments. The geographic concentration hypothesis tests whether the market's response to the translation information is geographically sensitive. Prior research on SFAS No. 8 and SFAS No. 52 has concentrated on the price and trading volume responses to the deliberations and issuance of these two accounting statements. Soo and Soo (1994) examine the long-term effect of the disclosure requirement under SFAS No. 52 on MNEs' security prices from 1981 to 1987. However, they fail to address two important issues pertinent to the MNE research [...] the effects of exchange rate changes and the geographic concentration. The dollar movement hypotheses provide strong evidence that under both the appreciating and depreciating exchange rate environments, a positive relationship exists between security returns and the translation information when MNEs disclose <b>translation</b> <b>losses</b> in stockholders' equity. The findings also provide evidence for a positive or at least non-negative relationship between security returns and the translation information when MNEs disclose translation gains. The findings provide evidence that the positive relationship is greater in appreciating than in depreciating exchange rate environment for losses, but no evidence of such a difference exists for gains. The evidence also indicates that the market reacts more to the translation information when <b>translation</b> <b>losses</b> are reported than when translation gains are reported in both exchange rate environments. The examination {{of the impact of the}} geographic concentration of MNEs' foreign operations provides limited evidence to support the geographic concentration hypothesis. One possible explanation for the weak findings is that the larger degree of the aggregation of some of the geographic disclosures prevents the market from impounding the geographic information...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{response}} of 103 financial managers of United States multinational corporations to the Financial Accounting Standards Board # 8 with regard to foreign currency translation. A sizeable majority of financial managers felt that FAS # 8 was inferior to their prior translation method and should be modified or eliminated. The article examines reported reasons for these responses. The effect of FAS # 8 upon exposure management is examined, with emphasis upon the fact that 23. 3 % of those respondents indicated that action intended to reduce accounting exposure has the direct effect of increasing economic exposure. Finally, consideration is given to implications of the financial officers expressed that financial analysts do not always assess properly the significance of <b>translation</b> <b>losses</b> and gains; this perception may not be true, in light of efficient markets considerations, but {{the actions of the}} corporate treasurers appear to be influenced by it. © 1978 JIBS.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the capital market {{effects of the}} specific disclosures of <b>translation</b> gains and <b>losses</b> required under SFAS 8 and its successor SFAS 52. Corporate management opposition to SFAS 8 {{on the grounds that}} the inclusion of <b>translation</b> gains and <b>losses</b> in income would adversely affect the prices of their stocks were instrumental in the replacement of SFAS 8 by 52. Drawing on the efficient market and information content theories, the case is made for both positive and negative effects from the requirements. Hypotheses are then developed and tested for the information in the disclosures. ^ In contrast to previous studies, expectation for <b>translation</b> gains and <b>losses</b> are introduced. The earlier of the receipt of the 10 -K or the annual report at the Securities and Exchange Commission is used as the event date, following recent studies that recognize that detailed information in financial statements are usually not made available at the earnings announcement date. ^ Results indicate a negative but insignificant reaction to the disclosures under SFAS 8. Useful information is found in the SFAS 52 disclosures although the direction of the effects are not consistent with each expectation model. The results from a test to determine if the economic exposure effects of exchange risks are immediately impounded before the accounting information is known did not show the returns of multinational corporations significantly different from the returns of a control sample of domestic firms during periods of sharp exchange rate changes. ^ The study contributes to the literature by finding first an empirical 2 ̆ 2 no 2 ̆ 2 answer to the adverse effects concerns generated by the required inclusion of <b>translation</b> gains and <b>losses</b> in income under SFAS 8 and second, support that useful information will be used by the market, regardless of where it is included in the financial statements. The absence of an a priori best expectation model for expected <b>translation</b> gains and <b>losses</b> detracts from the results. ...|$|R

40|$|Summary Pancreatic {{cancer is}} a deadly {{malignancy}} that lacks effective therapeutics. We previously reported that oncogenic Kras induced the redox master regulator Nfe 2 l 2 /Nrf 2 to stimulate pancreatic and lung cancer initiation. Here, we show that NRF 2 is necessary to maintain pancreatic cancer proliferation by regulating mRNA <b>translation.</b> Specifically, <b>loss</b> of NRF 2 led to defects in autocrine epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and oxidation of specific translational regulatory proteins, resulting in impaired cap-dependent and cap-independent mRNA translation in pancreatic cancer cells. Combined targeting of the EGFR effector AKT and the glutathione antioxidant pathway mimicked Nrf 2 ablation to potently inhibit pancreatic cancer ex vivo and in vivo, representing a promising synthetic lethal strategy for treating the disease...|$|R

40|$|SummaryMitochondrial {{transcription}} termination factor 1, MTERF 1, {{has been}} reported to couple rRNA gene transcription initiation with termination and is therefore thought to be a key regulator of mammalian mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis. The prevailing model is based on a series of observations published over the last two decades, but no in vivo evidence exists to show that MTERF 1 regulates transcription of the heavy-strand region of mtDNA containing the rRNA genes. Here, we demonstrate that knockout of Mterf 1 in mice has no effect on mitochondrial rRNA levels or mitochondrial <b>translation.</b> Instead, <b>loss</b> of Mterf 1 influences transcription initiation at the light-strand promoter, resulting in a decrease of de novo transcription manifested as reduced 7 S RNA levels. Based on these observations, we suggest that MTERF 1 does not regulate heavy-strand transcription, but rather acts to block transcription on the opposite strand of mtDNA to prevent transcription interference at the light-strand promoter...|$|R

Our results show that MBR decod-ing can be used to tune statistical MT perfor-mance for specific loss functions. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} simple {{dissemination}} models do not work. One {{of the strengths}} of close-up research, {{with its emphasis on}} depth and understanding, is that it can identify why things are as they are and by extension when we identify wrongs seek to challenge them. The paper suggests, however, that making a difference is fraught with contradictions and that the translation from research to action is far from straight forward. We illustrate these tensions by reflecting on our experiences of conducting four projects for the UK Higher Education Academy. At the same time as exploring the slippages of <b>translation</b> and <b>loss</b> of criticality, however, we want to defend notion of praxis as theoretically informed change for critical social purposes. This involves a view of making a difference and research that moves beyond thinking of research as a discrete act and invokes the significance of corporate agency and the possibilities of acting collectively...|$|R

40|$|Miscoordination {{of growth}} and {{proliferation}} with the cellular stress response can lead to tumorigenesis. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a central cell growth controller, is highly activated in some malignant neoplasms, and its clinical implications are under extensive investigation. We show that constitutive mTOR activity amplifies p 53 activation, in vitro and in vivo, by stimulating p 53 <b>translation.</b> Thus, <b>loss</b> of TSC 1 or TSC 2, the negative regulators of mTOR, results in dramatic accumulation of p 53 and apoptosis in response to stress conditions. In other words, the inactivation of mTOR prevents cell death by nutrient stress and genomic damage via p 53. Consistently, we also show that p 53 is elevated in TSC tumors, which rarely become malignant. The coordinated relationship between mTOR and p 53 during cellular stress provides a {{possible explanation for the}} benign nature of hamartoma syndromes, including TSC. Clinically, this also suggests that the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors in anti-neoplastic therapy may also depend on p 53 status, and mTOR inhibitors may antagonize the effects of genotoxic chemotherapeutics...|$|R
40|$|An avid translator, the poet, novelist, essayist and journalist, Dezső Kosztolányi {{believed}} in linguistic relativism, {{the uniqueness of}} each language-created world view, and the impossibility of translation. Paradoxically, one of his main concerns was to express in fiction various encounters between individuals belonging to different linguistic and cultural communities, and to explore whether communication between them was at all possible. It is exactly this double bind—this status of finding oneself between two or more cultures and languages—that the Hungarian novelist explored in many of his works, particularly in his last fictional writings, the Esti Kornél cycles: Esti Kornél (1933) and Esti Kornél Kalandjai (The Adventures of Kornél Esti, 1936). Several of the Esti Kornél episodes are linguistic explorations of the encounter between “self” and “other,” when these two often belong to different cultural and linguistic communities. The result of estranging language during such encounters leads {{to a better understanding}} of language and the context that created it—just as, in <b>translation,</b> the <b>loss</b> and, therefore, the presence of the original’s linguistic form is most acutely felt and understood by the translator...|$|R
