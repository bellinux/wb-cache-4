5|$|In contrast, in Fong Thin Choo, the High Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} under regulation 12(6) of <b>the</b> <b>Customs</b> Regulations 1979, the fact that goods had not been exported from Singapore was a precedent fact to <b>the</b> <b>customs</b> officer's power to require {{the owner of the}} goods to pay customs duty. Therefore, the Court had to decide whether <b>the</b> <b>customs</b> officer's decision was justified by the evidence, and not merely whether there was some evidence on which he could reasonably have reached his decision. However, the Court did not pursue the point since the applicant had not argued the case on this basis.|$|E
