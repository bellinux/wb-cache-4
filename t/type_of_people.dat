Michael Farr believed that in reviving so many older characters, Hergé had given The Red Sea Sharks [...] "a marked retrospective quality". Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier thought that the story was too crowded, leaving little room for series regulars Professor Calculus or Thomson and Thompson, and leaving the introduced figure of Skut as [...] "a nice supporting character, but nothing more".

500|$|During 1885, Yeats was {{involved}} {{in the formation of the}} Dublin Hermetic Order. The society held its first meeting on 16 June, with Yeats acting as its chairman. The same year, the Dublin Theosophical lodge was opened in conjunction with Brahmin Mohini Chatterjee, who travelled from the Theosophical Society in London to lecture. Yeats attended his first séance the following year. He later became heavily involved with the Theosophical Society and with hermeticism, particularly with the eclectic Rosicrucianism of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. During séances held from 1912, a spirit calling itself [...] "Leo Africanus" [...] apparently claimed it was Yeats's Daemon or anti-self, inspiring some of the speculations in Per Amica Silentia Lunae. He was admitted into the Golden Dawn in March 1890 and took the magical motto Daemon est Deus inversus—translated as Devil is God inverted or A demon is a god reflected. He was an active recruiter for the sect's Isis-Urania Temple, and brought in his uncle George Pollexfen, Maud Gonne, and Florence Farr. Although he reserved a distaste for abstract and dogmatic religions founded around personality cults, he was attracted to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> he met at the Golden Dawn. He {{was involved}} in the Order's power struggles, both with Farr and Macgregor Mathers, and was involved when Mathers sent Aleister Crowley to repossess Golden Dawn paraphernalia during the [...] "Battle of Blythe Road". After the Golden Dawn ceased and splintered into various offshoots, Yeats remained with the Stella Matutina until 1921.|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{concept for}} Faith's {{character}} was [...] "the road not taken", a Slayer {{who makes the}} wrong choices in life. She {{is intended to be}} a reflection of Buffy, and what Buffy could have become were it not for her support system of friends and family. The question the writers wanted to answer was, despite being made from the same [...] "raw materials," [...] how would upbringing and environment affect the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> they would become later in life? Joss Whedon describes her as everything Buffy would never let herself become; although Buffy is tempted by Faith's approach to slaying, she ultimately decides not to make the same choices herself. Some fans argued that the show developed a lesbian subtext between Faith and Buffy; Jane Espenson states that Whedon says he didn't intend this, but admitted it was there after he had it pointed out to him, jokingly attributing this to his subconscious.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the first}} Professor of English Literature at Leeds University, F.W. Moorman, claimed the first extant work of English literature, Beowulf, {{was written in}} Yorkshire, this view does not have common {{acceptance}} today. However, when Yorkshire formed {{the southern part of}} the kingdom of Northumbria [...] there were several notable poets, scholars and ecclesiastics, including Alcuin, Cædmon and Wilfrid. [...] The most esteemed literary family from the county are the three Brontë sisters, with part of the county around Haworth being nicknamed Brontë Country in their honour. Their novels, written in the mid-19th century, caused a sensation when they were first published, yet were subsequently accepted into the canon of great English literature. Among the most celebrated novels written by the sisters are Anne Brontë's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre and Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights. [...] Wuthering Heights was almost a source used to depict life in Yorkshire, illustrating the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> that reside there in its characters, and emphasising the use of the stormy Yorkshire moors. [...] Nowadays, the parsonage which was their former home is now a museum in their honour. Bram Stoker authored Dracula while living in Whitby and it includes several elements of local folklore including the beaching of the Russian ship Dmitri, which became the basis of Demeter in the book.|$|E
