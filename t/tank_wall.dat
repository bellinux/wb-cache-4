500|$|Aquariums {{have tried}} housing {{other species of}} whales in captivity. The success of belugas turned {{attention}} to maintaining their relative, the narwhal, in captivity. However, in repeated attempts in the 1960s and 1970s, all narwhals kept in captivity died within months. A pair of pygmy right whales were retained in an enclosed area (with nets); they were eventually released in South Africa. There was one attempt to keep a stranded Sowerby's beaked whale calf in captivity; the calf rammed into the <b>tank</b> <b>wall,</b> breaking its rostrum, which resulted in death. It was thought that Sowerby's beaked whale evolved to swim fast in a straight line, and a [...] tank was not big enough. There have been attempts to keep baleen whales in captivity. There were three attempts to keep grey whales in captivity. Gigi was a grey whale calf that died in transport. Gigi II was another grey whale calf that was captured in the Ojo de Liebre Lagoon, and was transported to SeaWorld. The [...] calf was a popular attraction, and behaved normally, despite being separated from his mother. A year later, the [...] whale grew too big to keep in captivity and was released; {{it was the first}} of two grey whales, the other being another grey whale calf named JJ, to successfully be kept in captivity. There were three attempts to keep minke whales in captivity in Japan. They were kept in a tidal pool with a sea-gate at the Izu Mito Sea Paradise. Another, unsuccessful, attempt was made by the U.S. [...] One stranded humpback whale calf was kept in captivity for rehabilitation, but died days later.|$|E

50|$|Compared to {{tankless}} heaters, storage {{water heaters}} {{have the advantage}} of using energy (gas or electricity) at a relatively slow rate, storing the heat for later use. The disadvantage is that over time, heat escapes through the <b>tank</b> <b>wall</b> and the water cools down, activating the heating system to heat the water back up, so investing in a tank with better insulation improves this standby efficiency. Additionally, when heavy use exhausts the hot water, there is a significant delay before hot water is available again. Larger tanks tend to provide hot water with less temperature fluctuation at moderate flow rates.|$|E
50|$|Many USTs {{were removed}} without {{replacement}} during the 10-year program. Many thousands of old underground tanks were replaced with newer tanks made of corrosion resistant materials (such as fiberglass, steel clad {{with a thick}} FRP shell, and well-coated steel with galvanic anodes) and others constructed as double walled tanks to form an interstice between two tank walls (a tank within a tank) which allowed {{for the detection of}} leaks from the inner or outer <b>tank</b> <b>wall</b> through monitoring of the interstice using vacuum, pressure or a liquid sensor probe.

50|$|During November 2004, Sharkdefense {{researcher}} Eric Stroud accidentally {{dropped a}} magnet onto a rubber mat near a captive tank at the Oak Ridge Shark Laboratory. He noticed that juvenile nurse sharks (G. cirratum) near the <b>tank</b> <b>wall</b> swam away. While the initial event {{may have been}} due to vibrations, it led him to test the effects of the magnet on the captive sharks. Placing the magnet within the tank, Eric observed that nurse sharks avoided the region around the magnet. Follow-on tests in 2005 with Michael Herrmann at the laboratory used an acrylic Y-Maze and showed preference towards non-magnetic exits and strong conditioning. During February 2005, Patrick Rice and Eric Stroud conducted tonic immobility trials at the Bimini Biological Field Station, Bahamas, which confirmed that juvenile lemon sharks (N. brevirostris) and juvenile nurse sharks (G. cirratum) roused when permanent magnets were presented within 50 cm of the sharks nares. Interestingly, mobility was not terminated when strong electromagnets were placed near the sharks.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} three {{methods of}} reducing distribution transformer losses.

40|$|With {{significant}} decrease in the background noise in present day automobiles, liquid slosh noise from an automotive fuel tank is considered as a great irritant during acceleration and deceleration. All major international OEMs and their suppliers try to reduce sloshing noise by various design modifications in the fuel tank. However, most major activities reported in open literature are primarily based on performing various CAE and experimental studies in isolation. At the same time, noise generation and its propagation is a multiphysics phenomenon, where uid mechanics due to liquid sloshing affects structural behaviour of the fuel tank and its mountings which in turn affects noise generation and propagation. In the present study, a multiphysics approach to noise generation {{has been used to}} predict liquid sloshing noise from a rectangular tank. By taking Computational Fluid dynamics (CFD) data, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Boundary Element Method (BEM) simulation studies have been performed in a semi-coupled manner to predict noise. Sloshing noise generated due to uid interaction with structural walls is simulated using Vibro-acoustic model. An integrated model is developed to predict dynamic forces and vibration displacement on <b>tank</b> <b>walls</b> due to dynamic pressure loading on <b>tank</b> <b>walls.</b> Noise radiated from <b>tank</b> <b>walls</b> is modelled by Harmonic Boundary Element Method and transient Finite Element method.
