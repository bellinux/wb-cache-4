5|$|Reactor {{operators}} {{were not}} trained {{to deal with}} accident conditions, and the NRC had not established effective communication with utilities. Moreover, once the accident occurred, the lines of authority proved to be ill defined. The public received conflicting reports that caused needless panic and evacuations. It was these systemic weaknesses in <b>the</b> <b>regulatory</b> system that allowed gifted people to make the mistakes they did.|$|E

We briefly compare <b>the</b> new 2007 <b>regulatory</b> framework with <b>the</b> previous ones.

5|$|Warfarin {{inhibits}} {{the vitamin}} K-dependent synthesis of biologically active {{forms of the}} calcium-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX and X, as well as <b>the</b> <b>regulatory</b> factors protein C, protein S, and protein Z. Other proteins not involved in blood clotting, such as osteocalcin, or matrix Gla protein, may also be affected.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, genes {{can have}} {{regulatory}} regions many kilobases upstream or downstream {{of the open}} reading frame that alter expression. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that <b>the</b> <b>regulatory</b> sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.|$|E

5|$|During viral replication, the {{integrated}} DNA provirus is transcribed into RNA, {{some of which}} then undergo RNA splicing to produce mature mRNAs. These mRNAs are exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where they are translated into <b>the</b> <b>regulatory</b> proteins Tat (which encourages new virus production) and Rev. As the newly produced Rev protein accumulates in the nucleus, it binds to full-length, unspliced copies of virus RNAs and allows them to leave the nucleus. Some of these full-length RNAs function as new copies of the virus genome, while others function as mRNAs that are translated to produce the structural proteins Gag and Env. Gag proteins bind to copies of the virus RNA genome to package them into new virus particles.|$|E
5|$|Glucocorticoids {{are under}} <b>the</b> <b>regulatory</b> {{influence}} of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Glucocorticoid synthesis is stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a hormone released into the bloodstream by the anterior pituitary. In turn, production of ACTH is stimulated {{by the presence of}} corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is released by neurons of the hypothalamus. ACTH acts on the adrenal cells first by increasing the levels of StAR within the cells, and then of all steroidogenic P450 enzymes. The HPA axis {{is an example of a}} negative feedback system, in which cortisol itself acts as a direct inhibitor of both CRH and ACTH synthesis. The HPA axis also interacts with the immune system through increased secretion of ACTH at the presence of certain molecules of the inflammatory response.|$|E
