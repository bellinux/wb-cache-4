5|$|The {{road through}} <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Luis</b> Rey Valley was planned {{as early as}} 1889, and was {{constructed}} during the early 20th century. It {{was added to the}} state highway system in 1933, while the condition of the highway continued to improve. <b>The</b> <b>San</b> <b>Luis</b> Rey Mission Expressway was eventually constructed during the 1990s and 2000s, and efforts were underway to extend the expressway east to I-15 during the 2010s.|$|E
5|$|The roadway {{carrying}} the SR76 designation begins at County Route S21 (CRS21) in Oceanside, although Caltrans {{does not consider}} the road west of I-5 {{to be part of}} the route, and it is not in the legal definition. There is soon an interchange with I-5, after which SR76 becomes a four-lane expressway known as <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Luis</b> Rey Mission Expressway. From I-5 to Mission Avenue, the highway parallels <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Luis</b> Rey River until it passes by Oceanside Municipal Airport. During this stretch, SR76 intersects Loretta Street, Canyon Drive, Benet Road, Airport Road, and Foussat Road. There are two overpasses: one over Mission Avenue, and one over El Camino Real, before the road intersects Douglas Drive, the main road to <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Luis</b> Rey gate of Camp Pendleton. After an intersection with Rancho Del Oro Road, SR76 passes over Mission Avenue again before intersecting with Old Grove Road, Frazee Road, a turnoff into the Towne Center North shopping center, and College Boulevard.|$|E

5|$|Although {{called an}} offstream storage {{reservoir}} by USBR, the reservoir floods part of <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Luis</b> Creek valley. San Luis Creek, however, {{is not the}} primary water source for the reservoir. Downstream of San Luis Reservoir is O'Neill Forebay, which is intersected by the Delta-Mendota Canal, a separate CVP facility. Water is pumped from the canal into the Forebay and uphill into San Luis Reservoir, which functions as an additional water source during dry periods.|$|E

5|$|As {{it enters}} rural Oceanside, SR76 intersects with North Santa Fe Avenue (CR S14), Guajome Lake Road (near Guajome County Park), and Melrose Drive. SR76 intersects the {{southern}} segment of CR S13, known as East Vista Way, and passes over <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Luis</b> Rey River on roughly parallel bridges before an intersection at North River Road. The highway passes through Bonsall, intersecting Via Montellano, Olive Hill Road, and Throughbred Lane. SR76 then meets the northern segment of CRS13, known as South Mission Road, while heading north into Fallbrook; SR76 {{is the primary}} road connecting the two portions of CRS13. Here, SR76 becomes known as Pala Road. It intersects Via Monserate and Gird Road south of Fallbrook before crossing the former routing of US 395 and the current routing of I-15 {{in the community of}} Pala Mesa Village.|$|E

5|$|By 2002, Caltrans had two {{proposals}} {{for the part}} of the widening project between East Vista Way and Mission Road: building the new highway on top of the old one, or constructing a new roadway to the south of <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Luis</b> Rey River. Concerns arose that the TransNet local sales tax would not be extended by voters, leading to the cancellation of that project. The San Diego Association of Governments included the widening east to Bonsall in the regional plan in 2003, but indicated that the portion from Bonsall to I-15 would be dependent on the availability of funding. Residents of Fallbrook and Bonsall criticized the fact that SR76 {{was one of the few}} TransNet projects that was not to be completed by the expiration of the tax in 2008. The city of Oceanside proposed plans for grade-separated interchanges with College Boulevard and Melrose Drive in 2004, as part of a proposal to convert the expressway through Oceanside to a freeway. After complaints from residents, these proposals were tabled.|$|E
5|$|In January1975, Caltrans {{presented}} {{plans to}} realign SR76 away from Mission Avenue {{and move it}} to {{the south side of}} <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Luis</b> Rey River from I-5 to Frontier Drive. One member of the Tri-Cities Taxpayers' League suggested that the freeway be built on the northern side of the river, and follow the river all the way east to I-15. Following concerns that the project would be cancelled due to lack of state funding, the California Highway Commission (CHC) stated that the proposal was still being considered. The City of Oceanside raised concerns about the congestion on Mission Avenue, as well as the realignment being a part of the city master plan. After this, {{at the start of the}} next year, the CHC decided to keep the proposal, though there were concerns that construction would be delayed due to the state financial crisis. Caltrans stated a few months later that SR76 would be delayed because of the funding issues and the relatively low levels of traffic that would not support building a freeway. Following this, State Senator John Stull alleged that Caltrans head Adriana Gianturco was purposefully delaying the project by delaying the release of the environmental impact report. A petition drive began soon after, supported by many North County leaders, with the exception of Bonsall due to concerns about a full freeway running through the community.|$|E
5|$|SR76 {{then goes}} through Pala and the Pala Indian Reservation, {{providing}} access to the Pala Casino and intersecting CR S16, the turnoff to the Pala Mission and Temecula. Continuing to parallel <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Luis</b> Rey River, SR76 passes by the Wilderness Gardens County Park before entering the community of Pauma Valley and meeting the southern terminus of CR S7 (Nate Harrison Grade), a dirt road leading into Palomar Mountain State Park. SR76 intersects the southern leg of CR S6 (Valley Center Road), leading to Valley Center and Escondido. East of the small Yuima Indian Reservation, it then encounters the northern leg of CRS6, the southern approach to the Palomar Observatory and Palomar Mountain State Park, {{as well as the}} community of La Jolla Amago. It then briefly passes through the Cleveland National Forest and meets the eastern terminus of CR S7, the eastern approach to Palomar Mountain. SR76 then passes along the shores of Lake Henshaw before terminating at the intersection with SR 79 at Morettis Junction, southeast of Lake Henshaw.|$|E
