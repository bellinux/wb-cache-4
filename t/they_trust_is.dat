50|$|Two comedic hosts try {{to deceive}} {{contestant}}s with unique/odd/implausible statements; one {{is telling the}} truth and another is lying. The contestant must decide which fact presented by the hosts is the truth in order to win money. After a few chances of guessing which host <b>they</b> <b>trust</b> <b>is</b> telling the truth, the contestant gets an opportunity to choose a true fact from a range of statements to add an additional $20,000 to their winnings.|$|E
50|$|There {{are as many}} as sixty {{offshore}} {{locations for}} wealthy investors to hide their money, including locations in the Caribbean, Channel Island, Switzerland and Lichtenstein. Another tactic that is employed is creating a secret identity where a person acts {{on behalf of the}} individual or trust. Cheating the system by wiring money through multiple payments below the $10,000 reportable amount is another way to go unnoticed. Some tax evaders take out credit cards with an identity connected to an offshore company. Moving money around by opening a bank account in a location that is not connect to where <b>they</b> <b>trust</b> <b>is</b> registered is another way to stay anonymous.|$|E
50|$|Hotels {{that added}} SeatID as a widget {{would be able}} to display to {{customers}} the list of people on their social networks who were previous customers.

SeatID is used by hotels of different countries, including United Kingdom, Italy, Hongkong, Thailand and Indonesia.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} aspects of the Reggio Emilia approach is the solicitation of multiple points of view regarding children's needs, interests, and abilities, and the concurrent faith in parents, teachers, and children to contribute in meaningful ways to the determination of school experiences. Teachers trust themselves to respond appropriately to children's ideas and interests, <b>they</b> <b>trust</b> children to <b>be</b> interested in things worth knowing about, and <b>they</b> <b>trust</b> parents to <b>be</b> informed and productive members of a cooperative educational team. The result is an atmosphere of community and collaboration that is developmentally appropriate for adults and children alike.|$|R
