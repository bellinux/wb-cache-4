Albumin-injected mice developed peak urinary total protein concentrations and peak incidence of high and medium mol. wt proteinuria after the third daily injection. Despite the fact that plasma total protein and plasma albumin concentrations remained elevated, both the total urinary protein and the incidence of large proteins fell after the third day.

30|$|The {{chemicals}} used for cleaning of stained marble are commonly applied in a poultice {{and a wide}} range of poultice material has been tested and applied in stone conservation. Clay materials, such as bentonite, attapulgite and sepiolite, are widely used either alone or in combination with cellulose fibres [4, 10, 34]. Other methods use cellulose fibres alone [35, 36], MC (methyl cellulose) [37], CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) [38], cotton pads [10, 38], and gels like glycerine [10], agar [39], agarose [40], or xanthan gum [3]. One of the newer materials used for poultices is the synthetic magnesium silicate clay Laponite® RD [41 – 44]. When dispersed in water, Laponite produces a colourless <b>thixotropic</b> <b>gel</b> that is easy to apply on specific areas and on vertical surfaces. The high purity of Laponite and thereby the absence of natural iron impurities means that discolouration of the marble surface from the poultices itself is avoided. In this study, Laponite® RD is mixed with cellulose fibres (Arbocel® BC 1000) with dimensions of 700  ×  20  μm (lenght and thickness) in order to increase the porosity, the absorbing properties and the water retention of the poultice. In addition to this, a small amount of sodium CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium salt) was also added. This resulted in better mechanical properties, increasing both the adherence and the cohesion of the poultice, making it easy to apply and remove in large pieces without crumbling. Another advantage of this poultice composition was its shrinkage properties: when drying it shrank practically only in the direction of thickness, leaving the area dimension intact. Hence a uniform cleaning from the centre {{to the edge of the}} poultice was obtained.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Currently, two {{commercial}} plants, {{operating in}} the Athabasca region of Alberta, produce approximately 20 percent of Canada's petroleum requirements from oil sands. Surface mined oil sand is treated in a water based separation process that yields large volumes of clay tailings with poor settling and compaction characteristics. Clay particles, suspended in the pond water, interact with salts, dissolved from the oil sands ore, to produce mature fine tailings (MFT) containing only 20 to 50 w/w % solids. As a result, large sedimentation ponds are required to produce enough process water to recycle for the plant. Tailings pond dykes can only be constructed during a short summer season. Consequently, the capability to predict production rate and final volume of MFT is essential for mine planning and tailings disposal operations. Previous research as demonstrated that {{a small fraction of}} nano sized clay particles (20 to 300 nm) effectively controls the bulk properties of MFT. These particles are present in the original ore and become mobilized into the water phase during the oil separation process. In this work, the nano sized particles have been separated from the bulk tailings and subjected to a fundamental study of their flocculation behavior in model tailings water. Photon correlation spectroscopy and a deuterium NMR method were used to follow particle flocculation and gelation processes. These results were correlated with particle settling data measured under the same conditions. It was determined that the nano particles form fractal flocs that eventually interact o give a <b>thixotropic</b> <b>gel.</b> The ultimate sediment volume produced is almost entirely dependent on the original concentration of nano particles while the rate of water release is governed primarily by electrolyte con-centration...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the production of}} advanced materials comprising {{a wide array of}} polymer-based building blocks. These materials include bio-hybrid polymer-peptide conjugates, based on phenylalanine and poly(ethylene oxide), and polymers with intrinsic microporosity (PIMs). Polymer-peptides conjugates were previously synthesised using click chemistry. Due to the inherent disadvantages of the reported synthesis, a new, simpler, inexpensive protocol was sought. Three synthetic methods based on amidation chemistry were investigated for both oligopeptide and polymerpeptide coupling. The resulting conjugates produced were then assessed by various analytical techniques, and the new synthesis was compared with the established protocol. An investigation was also carried out focussing on polymer-peptide coupling via ester chemistry, involving deprotection of the carboxyl terminus of the peptide. Polymer-peptide conjugates were also assessed for their propensity to self-assemble into <b>thixotropic</b> <b>gels</b> in an array of solvent mixtures. Determination of the rules governing this particular self-assembly (gelation) was required. Initial work suggested that at least four phenylalanine peptide units were necessary for self-assembly, due to favourable hydrogen bond interactions. Quantitative analysis was carried out using three analytical techniques (namely rheology, FTIR, and confocal microscopy) to probe the microstructure of the material and provided further information on the conditions for self-assembly. Several polymers were electrospun in order to produce nanofibres. These included novel materials such as PIMs and the aforementioned bio-hybrid conjugates. An investigation of the parameters governing successful fibre production was carried out for PIMs, polymer-peptide conjugates, and for nanoparticle cages coupled to a polymer scaffold.

40|$|Owning to {{its unique}} structure, {{along with the}} inexhaustible renewability, {{cellulose}} has been a subject of scientific and commercial interest for over 150 years. However, given attractive structural properties, such as stiffness, hydrophilicity, stereoregularity, potential for chemical modifications and ability to form superstructures, utilization of this biopolymer is far below its potential. The prospect of improving it is closely connected with chemical modification possibilities. The research presented in this thesis explores these possibilities {{with the emphasis on}} reactive groups employed for substitution of cellulose backbone in different modification systems. Under homogeneous conditions, in the system dimethyl sulfoxide/tetrabutylammonium fluoride four new esterfication agents for in situ activation of carboxylic acids were successfully employed in preparation of cellulose esters. In heterogeneous aqueous systems, focus was on readily quantified cationizations of cellulose accomplished by oxirane mediated etherifications. Reactions of two new etherification agents, 2 -oxiranylpyridine and N-oxiranylmethyl-N-methylmorpholinium chloride were explored. Etherification with the former provided cellulose with reactive pyridine moieties that could be utilized in further functionalizations, i. e. quaternizations of the pyridine nitrogen yielding cationic celluloses. Further, etherification with N-oxiranylmethyl-N-methylmorpholinium chloride introduced good leaving groups, N-methylmorpholine moieties, which could be employed in subsequent self-crosslinking reactions. Obtained crosslinked materials exhibited remarkably altered structure accessibility, highly defined by choice of crosslinking conditions. Oxirane mediated cationization was further applied on surface cationzation of cellulose nanocrystals. Reaction with N-oxiranylmethyltrimethylammonium chloride yielded sufficient surface cationization required to provide electrostatic colloidal stabilization of their aqueous suspensions. Interestingly, these suspensions exhibited <b>thixotropic</b> <b>gelling</b> along with the typical tendencies to self-order. Another cationization method applied on cellulose nanocrystals was studied, as well. It was based on intermediate esterification of cellulose nanocrystals with chloroacetylchloride in a non-aqueous system, followed by subsequent substitution with a tertiary amine. This procedure yielded highly cationized cellulose nanocrystals with varying extent of surface and bulk modification. In spite of overall high surface cationization the modified nanocrystals lacked colloidal stabilization in aqueous suspensions, which is likely an effect of strong interactions between introduced groups...|$|R
40|$|Hexagonal ferrites are {{a family}} of {{magnetic}} oxides which include M ferrite, {{the most commonly used}} magnetic material in the world today. They also have more specialist potential applications, such as microwave absorption and catalysis. They are highly complex crystal structures which usuaUy require high temperatures to form a well sintered product, at the expense of grain growth, which in tum affects the magnetic properties of the material. They all exhibit magneto crystalline anisotropy; depending upon the ferrite they can have a preferred direction of magnetisation along the c axis of the hexagonal crystal (uniaxial), or in the hexagonal plane or in a cone at an angle to the plane (ferroxplana). A material made in a fibrous form has many properties; firstly it can be incorporated into a matrix to form a composite material, imparting any special properties into the whole composite. Provided their microstructure is sufficiently fme, fibres tend to be stronger than the bulk ceramic form, and if fme enough they can even be woven into a cloth. It has also been suggested that some properties, such as magnetisation, will be enhanced when the material is an aligned fibre, although this specific case has never been proven previously. This thesis presents the manufacture of a range of hexagonal ferrite fme fibres from an inorganic aqueous sol-gel precursor, and their subsequent characterisation both physically and magnetically. The fibres were blow spun from a viscous solution using a modified commercial process, and they were collected in both random and aligned forms. The sols were made from the peptisation of a precipitated iron(III) hydroxide with a mineral acid, and various combinations of iron (III) salt and acid were investigated using PCS. The best results were found to come from iron(III) chloride precipitated by ammonia and peptised with HBr, with totally nitrate and chloride based systems proving inferior. Chloride was found to add structuring to the sol, aiding spinning but resulting in a <b>thixotropic</b> <b>gel</b> if too much was present.

40|$|The emulsion, {{which is}} a {{heterogeneous}} system, consisting {{of at least one}} immiscible liquid intimately dispersed in another in the form of droplets, is widely used in the fields of foods, pharmaceutics, cosmetics and various chemical industries. Several studies on the emulsion state, the stability of dispersed particles, the emulsification etc. have been made by many investigators. These results, however, are difficult to apply for the emulsions used in the above industrial fields, in which many kinds of organophilic substances or emulsifiers are used, since they give only some phenomenological interpretations. The purpose of this work is to obtain practically significant informations on the dispersion state of either oil-in-water type or water-in-oil type emulsion by studying mainly the rheological properties of the systems of various combinations of emulsifiers and oil components such as ionic or nonionic emulsifiers, saturated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and fatty alcohols. I. Effects of emulsifiers on flow properties of oil-in-water emulsions. Viscosities of the system of anionic emulsifier does not depend on the rate of shear at dispersion concentrations below 40 vol. %. The system of nonionic emulsifier shows non-Newtonian flow over the range of dispersion concentrations at relatively low rate of shear. At higher shear rate, however, flow of the system of nonionic emulsifier tends to show Newtonian behaviour and the values of relative viscosities of the system agree with those of the system of anionic emulsifier at the same dispersion concentrations. These difference in flow behaviour of two systems may be attributed to the difference in the dispersion state, which is remarkably influenced {{by the nature of the}} surface layer on the dispersed particle. The emulsion particles in the system of anionic emulsifier, whose surfaces are negatively charged by the ionized groups of emulsifier molecules, repel each other. On the other hand, the particles in the system of nonionic emulsifier, whose surfaces are surrounded by the hydrophilic molecules, can not repel each other and will form larger aggregates without losing their identity. II. Detection of solubilizate of dispersed liquid in oil-in-water emulsions. It may be expected from the studies of Lawrence and his school for the system of soap solution with amphiphiles, that a certain amount of dispersed liquid of emulsion is solubilized by the emulsifier existing in the dispersion medium. Gas chromatographic, nephelometric and viscometric measurements were used for inspecting the existence of solubilizate of dispersed liquid in the dispersion medium. The emulsions studied were composed of n-hexane, 1 -octanol or mixture of equal volume of both liquids in water, stabilized by anionic or nonionic emulsifiers, respectively. Dispersion media for measurements were separated from these emulsions by the fractionation of lower part of the emulsions after standing fifty days at 32 ℃. Existence of the solubilizates in the dispersion medium has been confirmed, the amount of which depends on the nature of the dispersed liquid and emulsifier, and also on the concentration of the emulsifier at constant temperature. The transparency and viscosity of the dispersion medium are influenced by the nature of the dispersed liquids and emulsifiers used for the preparation of the emulsions, as those of ordinary solubilized systems. III. Influence of polar component of dispersed liquids on dispersion state of oil-in-water emulsions. Viscosity, particle size and "creaming" volume of emulsions of n-hexane, 1 -cotanol or mixture of both liquids in water, stabilized by various emulsifiers, were compared with each other. Emulsions of n-hexane in water are relatively monodisperse and their viscosities increase with increasing amount of n-hexane in a usual manner. Emulsions of the mixture of n-hexane and 1 -octanol or 1 -octanol alone in water have higher viscosity, smaller particle size and larger "creaming" volume than the n-hexane in water emulsions in all dispersion concentrations studied. In the latter emulsions which contained 1 -octanol in the dispersed liquids, viscosity and "creaming" volume depend on the nature of the emulsifier, and are sensitive to the concentration of the emulsifier. The difference in dispersion state of emulsions stated above may be attributed to the difference in polarity between 1 -octanol and n-hexane in the dispersed liquids. IV. Viscosity and particle size of oil-in-water emulsions of dispersed liquids. Viscosity and particle size have been measured for the emulsions of saturated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and fatty alcohols stabilized with anionic emulsifier. It has been observed that the viscosity increased and the particle size decreased with dispersed liquid in the following order; saturated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, 1 -pentanol, 1 -hexanol, 1 -heptanol, 1 -octanol and 1 -decanol. The phenomena appear to be interpreted in terms of difference of the interaction between the emulsifiers and the dispersed substances. The various factors affecting the emulsion viscosity, such as particle size distribution, viscosity of suspending fluid or formation of aggregate between dispersed particles, are also discussed. V. The effect of suspending fluids on relative viscosity of water-in-oil emulsions. The relative viscosity of water-in-oil emulsions, stabilized by sorbitan monostearate, was found to be influenced by the species of suspending fluids. The fluids tested include n-hexane, cyclohexane, decalin, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, toluene, xylene and tetralin. The dependence of both relative viscosity and sedimentation volume of the dispersed particles upon the concentrations of emulsifier are also influenced by the suspending fluids at a constant dispersion concentration. The results can be explained in terms of the difference in aggregated states of water droplets in each suspending fluid, which is present at various concentrations of emulsifier. VI. Rheological studies of concentrated oil-in-water emulsion. The rheological behaviour of the concentrated oil-in-water emulsion in the state of so-called "cream," has been investigated by the measurements of responses in the range of low frequency, yield value under the slight deformation and the steady-flow viscosity. The concentration in weight percent of the components of system was as follows: water, 56; liquid paraffin, 35; Arlacel 169, 1; cetylalcohol, 1; Arlacel 60, 2; Tween 60, 5. The emulsion was prepared by mixing these components at 80 ℃, where spontaneous emulsification occurs, and its rate of cooling from the mixed temperature to 25 ℃ was 4, 3, 1, 0. 3, 0. 2 and 0. 1 degrees per minute, respectively. This procedure gave six types of samples. Samples prepared at a slow rate of cooling (below 1 degrees per minutes) were already in the state of "cream" at the end of the cooling procedure, and their viscoelasticity and yield value increased with the aging time. From these results, and also from the nature of the change in the steady-flow viscosity with aging, the state of "cream" may be considered to be brought about by the formation of both <b>thixotropic</b> <b>gel</b> structure and the irreversible binding between dispersed particles. On the other hand, the samples prepared at a fast rate of cooling (above 3 degrees per minutes) showed low stiffness and no change in their rheological properties with the aging time. VII. Particle-size determination of suspensions or emulsions by viscometry. An apparatus for sedimentation analysis by the viscometric method, making possible the measurement of viscosity change with time at a fixed position in the bulk due to the sedimentation or ascension of dispersed particles, has been constructed. The new method has been examined with both a potato-starch-granule suspension and oil-in-water emulsions. It is concluded that the aggregated state of dispersed particles in the bulk of emulsions, consisting of both macroscopic droplets and solubilized micells in all the cases studied, are not only affected by the kind of emulsifiers, but also by the nature of oil phase through the interaction between the emulsifiers and the polar groups or π-electrons in the components. In view of more practical use, the emulsion in the state of so-called "cream" has been investigated by the method of mechanical responses, and it has been found that "cream" is brought about by the formation of both <b>thixotropic</b> <b>gel</b> structure and the irreversible binding between dispersed particles. A new method of particle-size determination for the dispersed systems by the viscometry has also been proposed...|$|E
40|$|A silver ion (Ag+) -triggered <b>thixotropic</b> metallo(organo) <b>gel</b> of p-pyridyl-appended oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) {{derivatives}} (OPVs) {{is reported}} for the first time.

Microscopic studies of the trihybrid gel indicate the formation of three distinct morphologies, that is, nanoscale metal organic particles (NMOPs), flowerlike aggregates of SWCNHs and AgNPs, and also their integration with each other.

40|$|Master's thesis in Industrial economicsThis master`s {{thesis is}} called “Pumping of Gelled fluid in Pipeline Applications” and {{is carried out}} on request by Halliburton Pipeline & Process Services. The reason this thesis is carried out is that more {{information}} is needed to predict accurately the required pumping pressure to encounter when pumping gelled fluids. A test program {{was set up to}} provide data from situations similar to those from real projects. The test program was designed so {{it would be easy to}} collect and compare data. It was therefore carried out by pumping different gel plugs of lengths of 50, 100 and 150 meters into three different pipelines of 2, 4 and 6. 1 inches in diameter. The gel used in these gel tests is called Temblok- 50 ™. This is a Halliburton produced gel which is made by mixing a linear gel with a cross-linker. Cross-links are bonds that link one polymer chain to another. The Temblok- 50 ™ is a viscous water based gel with an extremely tough cohesive structure developed for use where a long life material is required. It is formed by cross-linking a natural gum or its derivatives in alkaline pH conditions. Temblok- 50 ™ is also a <b>thixotropic</b> <b>gel</b> because it has a time dependent viscosity. Fanning`s equation is used for calculating the theoretical pressure needed for moving gel plugs. A rewriting of Fanning`s equation gives the equation which is used in this thesis. This equation is shown below with an explanation of the different characters: Where: = pressure for moving the gel plug [bar] = pipe diameter [in] = wall shear stress [bar] = length of the gel plug [m] A thorough explanation of this equation and its use is seen in chapter 6. 1, Theoretical pressure. A test program for gathering accurate pumping and pressure data was planned. The aim with these tests was to figure out what pressure is needed to move gel plugs in a pipeline. The different gel plugs were placed inside 2 and 4 inch pipelines at a test site in Risavika Harbor and a 6. 1 inch pipeline at IRIS research center`s test site. To figure out how gel plugs move in the pipe, and if it is possible to get water pushing the gel, to flow past the gel plug without moving it, transparent pipes were used in different tests at the University of Stavanger. Before the tests in Risavika Harbor and at IRIS were carried out, safety margins between pressure safety valves (PSV) and calculated pressure were calculated. It was also calculated how much gel was needed. Initial to the gel tests was a tests set-up containing the P&ID (piping and instrumentation diagram), procedure and a work schedule designed. The test set up in Risavika Harbor was made of two main units, one pumping unit and one pipeline unit. The pumping unit is the same for every test, but the pipeline unit is changed between the 2 and 4 inch pipeline unit depending on which pipeline the test 3 was carried out in. These pipeline units were made by mounting together pup joints of different lengths to achieve two loops of the total lengths of 350 meters for the 2 inch pipeline and 250 meters for the 4 inch pipeline. At IRIS`s test site there is a 700 meter long and 6. 1 inches in diameter permanent pipeline to which the pumping unit was connected. This pipeline is build by mounting together casings. At the University of Stavanger a transparent pipe with the inner diameter of 1. 57 inches was placed vertical and a rubber plug connected to a pole was placed inside the pipe. Linear gel and cross-linker was poured into the pipe. Gel plugs ranging in length from 30 cm to 120 cm were set to settle in the pipe for more than 12 hours. After gel plugs had been settling in the vertical pipe for more than 12 hours the whole pipe was moved and placed horizontally in the test set up. The rubber plug was then removed by pulling it out while rotating the pole. The test set up consisted of a small Gilson pump, a hose which connected the Gilson pump and the 1. 57 inch transparent pipe. The transparent pipe had a t-junction connection in the beginning of it. A pipe was placed vertically from this t-junction and it had a valve connected to the top of it. A hose going upwards was connected to the end of the transparent pipe at the end of the pipe which was in front of the gel plug. The reason for using the vertical pipe from the t-junction and the upwards going hose was to make it possible to fill the pipe with water both in front and behind the gel plug, which was the last to be carried out before a test was run. The results produced by the tests in Risavika Harbor, IRIS research center and at the University of Stavanger were interpreted and presented in this thesis. There are many variables which have to be considered when interpreting the data from the gel tests. These variables are such as pipe diameter, length of gel plug, temperature, shear stress, cracks, settling time, first and second time the gel plug is set, flow of water pushing the gel plug, remains of gel in the pipeline and uncertainty of the data collected. From these variables it is discovered that all of them had some influence on the pressure needed to push gel plugs. The variables of first and second time gel plugs are set and remains of gel in the pipeline could be neglected when the pressure needed to start moving gel plugs are calculated. If it is the first or the second time gel plugs are set has almost no influence on the pressure needed to move gel plugs. Remains of gel in the pipeline have a bigger influence on gel plugs when they are already set in motion. The variables which need to be included, when pressure needed to move gel plugs is calculated, are pipe diameter, length of gel plug, temperature, shear stress, settling time and flow of water pushing the gel plug. It can be concluded that Fanning`s theoretical equation does not contain of enough variables to calculate the correct pressure needed to move gel plugs. This equation contains the variables; pipe diameters, length of gel plug and shear stress. Experience from the test results is that this equation lacks the variables of settling time, temperature and flow rate of water pushing the gel plug. In the theoretical equation for calculating pressure needed to move the gel plug the influence of length of gel plug and pipe diameter is probably right. The shear stress which is seen in the equation as has the formula of. This means that the formula for shear stress contains viscosity and velocity of 4 the gel plug, and pipe diameter, but none of the other variables. The influence of these three variables in a new expression for shear stress which will be a part of a new equation for calculating the pressure needed to start moving gel plugs in pipelines is unknown. What is known is that in this new equation temperature, flow rate of water pushing the gel plug and settling time has to be included. Settling time influences shear stress because the gel plug “sticks” more to the pipe wall when it settles. This will make it harder to move and gives in a way the wall more shear stress because the gel plugs “work” together with the shear stress of the pipe wall and provides more shear stress which the pump has to overcome to push gel plugs forward. The influence of temperature on the pressure needed to move gel plugs was not measured accurately enough. What can be concluded from the gel tests is that when a pipe with a gel plug inside is exposed to temperatures below zero degrees Celsius, the pressure needed to move gel plugs will be much lower than if the pipe has not been exposed. It can also be concluded that gel plugs will not be destroyed by being moved in or influenced by the pipe being exposed to temperatures below zero degrees Celsius. Flow rate of water given by the pump does not directly influence the shear stress, but it influences the shear stress indirectly. Too low flow rate will make the water, which is supposed to push the gel plug, flow into the crack between the top of the gel plug and the pipe wall. This crack is made because gel has a higher density than water and therefore water tends to flow on top of the gel. If the flow rate given by the pump is too low, then water will flow past the gel plug on top of it. Water can then either flow all the way across on the top if the gel or it can “drill” itself downwards in the gel plugs if there are air bubbles or bends in the pipe. When the flow rate of water given by the pump is high enough, it will “punch” the end of the gel plug so hard that it will be pushed upwards and seal the crack in top of the gel plug, making it possible to neglect the influence of this crack. The tests carried out at the University of Stavanger in the transparent pipes showed that there are many coincidences involved in the behavior of gel plugs. It was discovered that the top of the gel plug is the first part of it to be pushed forwards by pressure coming from the water which is pushed by the pump. The whole gel plug therefore starts to move first in the top of the gel plug and last in the bottom of it. The shape of the end of the gel plugs and if there are bubbles in it influence the pressure needed to move the gel plug. If the end of the gel plug is inclined the flow rate needed to push the end of the gel plug upwards has to be bigger than if the end of the gel plug is vertical. Because the shape of end of the gel plug is not easy to predict, it is hard to figure out if the water is going to flow on top of the gel or push it forwards. If there are air bubbles on top of the gel plug near the end of it the air bubbles will influence the pressure needed to move gel plugs because the air bubbles will help water to flow on top of the gel plug. Both air bubbles and the inclination of the end of the gel plug can cause the gel plug to split into two gel plugs. The conclusion is that the gel tests have given much information about how gel behaves in pipes and different pressures needed to move different lengths of gel plug in pipes of different sizes. A complete equation for calculating the pressure needed to move gel plugs cannot be calculated from these results because the behavior of the end of the gel plug and the influence of temperature is not well enough 5 documented. There are still many things to be tested before an equation which calculates the pressure needed for moving gel plugs can be constructed, but these gel tests are a step in the right direction...|$|E
40|$|The {{rheology}} of acid milk gels is investigated as an elasto-viscoplastic <b>thixotropic</b> fluid. The <b>gel</b> is a colloidal protein {{network that}} upon shear {{is transformed into}} suspension of aggregates where the original rheology of the gel is not recoverable. It is shown that the measured characteristic size of the aggregates is directly proportional to a structural parameter (λ) obtained from rheological measurements. This supports {{the use of the}} λ in elasto-viscoplastic constitutive models as a representation of the changing structure in the suspension. λ also correlates to the aggregate particle size after initially breaking down the structure at high shear rate and then allowing the structure to recover at lower shear rates. Following this shear breakdown/recovery, a broader particle size distribution is observed compared with the results obtained during breakdown of the initial set gel. This structural difference may be critically linked to the thixotropic rheological properties of the sheared gels.

Much later a substance which was originally called "taylorite " after William Taylor, {{who was the first}} to draw attention to it, was finally designated as "bentonite" because it was first found in the Fort Bemon series of rocks in Montana. The most characteristic mineral component of bentonite is crystalline and definitely mont-morillonite. The chemical analyses of Wyoming bentonite and hectorite are compared with those of three different calcium bentonite deposits. The importance of more up-to-date crystal chemical considerations i discussed. The electrophoretic properties of ben-tonites are explained {{on the basis of the}} available counter ions. The formation of <b>thixotropic</b> bentonite <b>gels</b> is discussed in detail and proof is offered to show why calcium bentonites do not give thixotropic systems.

Ultra- and electron photomicrographic studies reveal the difference between mont-morillonites and the various types of bentonites now known. Most striking is the fact that most bentonites, specifically calcium bentonites, contain several different types of clayey minerals.

40|$|The {{quality of}} a {{bentonite}} suspension declines in aggressive systems like brackish or saline pore water. An engineered clay (HYPER clay) was developed for sealing materials with enhanced resistance to aggressive conditions. The modified clay is produced by treating a sodium activated bentonite with a cellulose polymer following the HYPER clay process method. This study investigates the suitability of the modified clay for electrolyte contaminated drilling fluids. Drilling fluids become contaminated with saline pore water, e. g. pick up an electrolyte contamination, while drilling a formation at for example an estuary or near the coast. Preliminary laboratory tests were performed to study drilling fluid resistance to electrolytes. Therefore the drilling fluids were contaminated with sea water.

40|$|The {{properties}} of hydrophobically modified cellulose derivatives in aqueous mixtures with various other molecules have been investigated. Mixtures of a hydrophobically modified polymer and alkali-sensitive, degradable surfactants {{gave rise to}} time-dependent viscosities. With time, the viscosity decreased continuously or went through a maximum, depending on the initial surfactant concentration. The rate of change could be controlled by pH. The alcohol formed by degradation acted as a cosurfactant, and varying the hydrophobic chain length gave rise to different viscosity profiles. Phase separation temperatures and viscosities of aqueous mixtures of the hydrophobically modified cellulose derivatives and block copolymers have been investigated. The block copolymers were hydrophobically modified at one or both ends. The results were consistent with hydrophobic association between the cellulose derivatives and the block copolymers. Moderate viscosity enhancements were found on addition of the block copolymers to the cellulose derivatives and the effects were larger with the block copolymer that was modified at both ends. Amylose can cross-link hydrophobically modified polymers by inclusion complexation, whereby strong, <b>thixotropic,</b> thermoreversible, cold-setting, <b>gels</b> are formed. The gel strength {{as a function of}} the architecture of the polymer hydrophobes has been investigated. The hydrophobes were based on linear alkyl chains and longer alkyl chains gave stronger gels. For similar alkyl chain lengths, stronger gels were obtained when a spacer consisting of ethylene oxide units was inserted between the alkyl chain and the polymer backbone. The competition between amylose and cyclodextrin for the formation of inclusion complexes with hydrophobically modified polymers has also been studied. The cyclodextrin molecules competed efficiently with the amylose molecules as seen by rheology, self-diffusion and NMR intensities of the polymer hydrophobes. A detailed study of the hydrophobically modified polymers and cyclodextrin has been performed where it was seen that 2 : 1 (cyclodextrin:polymer hydrophobe) complexes were formed. Stability, droplet diameter and viscosity of o/w macroemulsions stabilized with lecithin and different types of polymers have been examined. Emulsions without polymers showed essentially no stability against creaming. Unmodified polymers provided limited stability, while hydrophobically modified polymers improved the stability dramatically.

40|$|Hypergolic {{propellants}} {{are widely}} used by the propulsion community in various applications. A monomethylhydrazine fuel and nitrogen tetroxide-based oxidizer rep- resent {{the state of the}} art for hypergolic propellants. The health hazards associated with these propellants has prompted research into gelled formulations due to the inherent safety advantages of gels. Gelling propellants alters many of the chemical and physical properties relevant to the processes encountered in rocket engines. The effect of these altered properties must be understood and quantified before a system utilizing gelled propellants can be fielded. This study explores the rheological properties of gelled monomethylhydrazine and red fuming nitric acid as well as the ignition of liquid and gelled monomethylhydrazine and red fuming nitric acid. ^ Monomethylhydrazine has been gelled with various concentrations of hydroxypropylcellulose. A simple procedure for mixing the gel was developed and the viscosity-shear rate relationship measured with a rotational rheometer. Increasing the hydroxypropylcellulose concentration increased the viscosity of the monomethylhydrazine gels and increased the shear-thinning behavior of the gels. The viscosity- shear rate relationship was modeled using the power-law and Carreau-Yasuda models to quantify the repeatability of the rheological properties. The viscosity measurements for the monomethylhydrazine gels generally varied less than 25 % from the average for a single gel formulation. The monomethylhydrazine gels had negligible yield stresses and were not thixotropic. ^ Red fuming nitric acid was gelled with 3, 4, and 5 % by mass fumed silica using a mixing procedure developed for silica-hydrocarbon gels. The red fuming nitric acid <b>gels</b> exhibited shear-thinning, <b>thixotropic</b> behavior and had measurable yield stress values. Increasing the fumed silica concentration increased the viscosity, the shear-thinning behavior, and the yield stress of the gels. A power-law curve fit was applied to the viscosity-shear rate results and demonstrated large variations in the rheological measurements. The large deviations resulted from the <b>thixotropic</b> behavior the <b>gels.</b> A method that presheared the gel samples prior to performing the rheological measurements led to improved measurement repeatabililty. ^ The ignition of liquid monomethylhydrazine and red fuming nitric acid was examined through a series of drop tests and impinging jet tests with a unlike-doublet injection system. Drop tests resulted in minimum ignition delays of 1. 5 milliseconds characterized by a flame and a loud report. In the impinging jet tests an ignition event defined by a visible flame was observed only at injection velocities from 8 to 20 ft/s. The ignition events were characterized by poor mixing and the burning of large monomethylhydrazine drops with no flame spreading. A series of impinging jet tests with a hydrocarbon-based fuel mixture and 91. 2 % H 2 O 2 resulted in repeatable ignition delays from 6 to 8 ms at injection velocities from 48 to 138 ft/s, verifying the system functionality. Additional jet tests with a fuel mixture of 2 -dimethylaminoethylazide and tetramethylethylenediamine with red fuming nitric acid exhibited similar ignition behavior to the monomethylhydrazine and red fuming nitric acid tests. An investigation into the red fuming nitric acid composition points to the presence of some impurity that may be altering the ignition processes. Impinging jet tests were also performed with monomethylhydrazine and red fuming nitric acid gels. Although an ignition event was generally not observed, the gels exhibited distinct flow patterns related to the rheological properties of the propellants. ...|$|R
