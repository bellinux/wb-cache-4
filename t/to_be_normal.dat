5|$|When Rocky was {{diagnosed}} with brain damage, {{it must be noted}} that many athletes have a form of brain damage including football players, soccer players, and other individuals in contact sports such as rugby, etc. Rocky never went for a second opinion and yielded to his wife's wishes to stop. So with the advent of new research techniques into brain damage, Rocky was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>normal</b> among fighters, and he was suffering the results of a severe concussion. By today's standards Rocky Balboa would be given a clean bill of health for fighters.|$|E
5|$|Over twenty skulls {{have been}} found from this dinosaur. As with other lambeosaurines, the animal bore a tall, {{elaborate}} bony crest atop its skull, which contained the elongate narial passages. The narial passages extended into the crest, first into separate pockets in the sides, then into a single central chamber and onward into the respiratory system. The skull of the type specimen has no dermal impressions on it. During preservation it was compressed laterally, so now the width is about two-thirds {{what it would have}} been in real life. According to Brown, the compression also caused the nasals to shift where they pressed down on the premaxillaries. Because they were pressed on the premaxillaries, the nasals would have closed the nares. Apart from the compression, the skull appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>normal.</b> Contrary to what Brown assumed, the areas concerned were fully part of the praemaxillae.|$|E

25|$|Some {{children}} {{may have a}} slightly raised temperature; high fever and general malaise point to other, more serious conditions. On clinical examination, the child typically holds the hip slightly bent, turned outwards {{and away from the}} middle line (flexion, external rotation and abduction). Active and passive movements may be limited because of pain, especially abduction and internal rotation. The hip can be tender to palpation. The log roll test involves gently rotating the entire lower limb inwards and outwards with the patient on his back, to check when muscle guarding occurs. The unaffected hip and the knees, ankles, feet and spine are found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>normal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Video of the {{crashing}} aircraft {{shows it}} rolling to starboard and simultaneously diving to the ground. Both port engines are producing {{significant amounts of}} smoke. The smoke produced from the port engines appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>normal</b> engine exhaust, which highlights the absence of exhaust from the starboard pair of engines. If two of the engines on the aircraft were not operational, {{a significant amount of}} asymmetric thrust would be generated, which is capable of causing an aircraft to roll unless properly corrected for. The video also clearly shows the aircraft otherwise configured for landing, with extended flaps and landing gear down. A failure of both engines on one wing for this aircraft type may exceed the rudder authority of the aircraft to counter the asymmetric thrust.|$|E

25|$|The Britannia Empress of Lima {{was on a}} {{scheduled}} flight from Honolulu Airport, Hawaii to Nadi Airport, Fiji. Shortly after take-off the crew had an engine fire warning, they feathered No. 1 engine and they jettisoned fuel before returning to Honolulu 40 minutes later. The three-engined approach appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>normal</b> {{but at the last}} minute the crew decided to go-around and attempt another approach. The aircraft banked and veered to the left and the left wing tip hit the ground about 550 feet left from the center over the runway. The aircraft then disintegrated as it moved across the airfield before hitting some heavy earth-moving equipment. Apart from the rear fuselage and tail the aircraft was destroyed by fire, thirteen on board escaped but seven crew and 20 passengers were killed.|$|E

The bus was allegedly travelling at 15–20 miles per hour, although Carter and another witness estimated its speed as 40–45 miles per hour. The bus driver, John William George Samson, 57, {{had worked for the}} company for forty years, twenty-five of them as a driver. He was very familiar with the route. He had his sidelights on, but not his headlights; this was perfectly legal and considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>normal</b> practice at the time. Other bus drivers said that they were using headlights that night and in that location as it was particularly dark. Other drivers defended Samson's decision not to use his headlights.|$|E
25|$|While the {{possibility}} that certain individuals may be born with musical deficits {{is not a new}} notion, the first documented case of congenital amusia was published relatively recently. The study was conducted with a female volunteer, referred to as Monica, who declared herself to be musically impaired in response to an advertisement in the newspaper. Monica had no psychiatric or neurological history, nor did she have any hearing loss. MRI scans showed no abnormalities. Monica also scored above average on a standard intelligence test, and her working memory was evaluated and found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>normal.</b> However, Monica suffers from a lifelong inability to recognize or perceive music, which has persisted even after involvement with music through church choir and band during her childhood and teenage years. Monica even admits that she does not enjoy listening to music because, to her, it sounds like noise and evokes a stressful response.|$|E
