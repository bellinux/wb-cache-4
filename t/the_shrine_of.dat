Several Norfolk, Suffolk and West Country parish churches are dedicated to the saint.|$|E

5|$|Several {{kings of}} the Middle Ages lay in state in St Paul's before their {{funerals}} at Westminster Abbey, including Richard II, Henry VI and Henry VII.

5|$|A {{feature of}} central York is the Snickelways, narrow {{pedestrian}} routes, {{many of which}} led towards the former market-places in Pavement and St Sampson's Square. The Shambles is a narrow medieval street, lined with shops, boutiques and tea rooms. Most of these premises were once butchers' shops, and the hooks from which carcasses were hung and the shelves on which meat was laid out can still be seen outside some of them. The street also contains <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> <b>of</b> Margaret Clitherow, {{although it is not}} located in the house where she lived.

5|$|A {{few days}} afterwards, Blamey became seriously ill and {{received}} his field marshal's baton from McKell in a bedside {{ceremony at the}} Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital. Blamey died there of hypertensive cerebral haemorrhage on 27 May 1951. His body lay in state at <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> <b>of</b> Remembrance, where 20,000 people filed past. Crowds estimated at 300,000 lined the streets of Melbourne at his state funeral. Ten of his lieutenant generals served as pallbearers: Frank Berryman, William Bridgeford, Edmund Herring, Iven Mackay, Leslie Morshead, John Northcott, Sydney Rowell, Stanley Savige, Vernon Sturdee and Henry Wells. His body was cremated at the Fawkner Crematorium and Memorial Park.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the temple}} was located in the {{south-east}} corner of the enclosure wall. The entrance led to an open courtyard that stretched from east to west. The ritual cleaning and preparation of the offerings took place here. Because of the extensive degradation suffered by the temple, reconstruction attempts are somewhat speculative. From the ruins, archaeologists propose that the temple comprised an open colonnade, possibly made of granite, a sacrificial chapel adjoining the pyramid side, three statue niches and a few magazine chambers. No traces of a cult pyramid were found onsite. In {{the halls of the}} temple were depictions of animal processions and offerings carriers moving towards <b>the</b> <b>Shrine</b> <b>of</b> the Queen.|$|E
