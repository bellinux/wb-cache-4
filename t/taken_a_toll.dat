5|$|By {{the late}} 20th century, Michigan's harsh winters had <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> on the terra cotta statue, as had {{vandalism}} by fans of MSU's rival school, the University of Michigan. While annual repair work helped stem {{the damage done}} by precipitation, extreme cold, and vandalism, the statue needed more intensive repair.|$|E
5|$|The 17th {{was first}} {{assigned}} to garrison duty at Fort Stanwix, where Montgomery remained until 1764. In 1764, Montgomery applied to Colonel Campbell and General Thomas Gage for leave {{to return to}} England, as his service in the Caribbean had <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> on his health. Gage granted the leave, directing Colonel Campbell to give {{it as soon as}} possible. Campbell, whose officer ranks had been depleted in the Caribbean campaign, would only grant the leave after the upcoming expedition.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{resignation}} from the Senate, Pierce {{had no intention}} of leaving public life. The move to Concord had given him more opportunities for cases, and allowed Jane a more robust community life. Jane had remained in Concord with her young son Frank and her newborn Benjamin for the latter part of Pierce's Senate term, and this separation had <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> on the family. Pierce, meanwhile, had begun a demanding but lucrative law partnership with Asa Fowler during congressional recesses. Pierce returned to Concord in early 1842, and his reputation as a lawyer continued to flourish. Known for his gracious personality, eloquence, and excellent memory, Pierce would attract large audiences to hear him in court. He would often represent poor people for little or no compensation.|$|E

5|$|Loggerheads are {{considered}} {{an endangered species}} and are protected by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Untended fishing gear is responsible for many loggerhead deaths. Turtles may also suffocate if they are trapped in fishing trawls. Turtle excluder devices have been implemented in efforts to reduce mortality by providing an escape route for the turtles. Loss of suitable nesting beaches {{and the introduction of}} exotic predators have also <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> on loggerhead populations. Efforts to restore their numbers will require international cooperation, since the turtles roam vast areas of ocean and critical nesting beaches are scattered across several countries.|$|E
5|$|Leon Czolgosz {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan, in 1873, the son of Polish immigrants. The Czolgosz family moved several times as Paul Czolgosz, Leon's father, sought work {{throughout}} the Midwest. As an adult, Leon Czolgosz worked in a Cleveland factory until {{he lost his job}} in a labor dispute in 1893. Thereafter, he worked irregularly and attended political and religious meetings, trying to understand the reasons for the economic turmoil of the Panic of 1893. In so doing, he became interested in anarchism. By 1901, this movement was feared in the United States—New York's highest court had ruled that the act of identifying oneself as an anarchist {{in front of an audience}} was a breach of the peace. Anarchists had <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> in Europe by assassinating or attempting assassinations of a half-dozen officials and members of royal houses, and had been blamed for the 1886 Haymarket bombing in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} in the lead-up was further compounded by the media attention surrounding Phelps, who had decided that the 200m freestyle {{would be one of}} the events in his quest for eight gold medals. This prompted many media outlets to label the race between Thorpe, van den Hoogenband, Phelps and Hackett as The Race of the Century. With the press spotlight growing, Thorpe tried to avoid media attention, resulting in a few terse media events. Thorpe's increasing focus on the 100m event, coupled with the media pressure, resulted in speculation that he was vulnerable to Hackett in the 400m event. Thorpe made a slow start in the final, reaching the 100m mark one second outside world record pace. In a topsy-turvy performance at irregular pace, there were multiple changes of lead before Thorpe established a body-length lead by 350m. He was closed down by Hackett, holding on by only 0.26s in a time three seconds outside his own world record. Thorpe appeared to shed tears in an uncharacteristic sign of emotion, admitting that the controversy surrounding the event had <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> on him, but denying that any liquid had left his eyes.|$|E

25|$|By 1859, his illnesses, his {{long-term}} use of laudanum, his life {{of stress and}} poverty had <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> and Baudelaire had aged noticeably. But at last, his mother relented and agreed to let him live with {{her for a while}} at Honfleur. Baudelaire was productive and at peace in the seaside town, his poem Le Voyage being one example of his efforts during that time. In 1860, he became an ardent supporter of Richard Wagner.|$|E

Jones appeared a lot weaker after coming back down to the light heavyweight division, losing the muscle he gained for the heavyweight fight seemed to have <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> on his aging body and his cat-like reflexes appeared diminished. Jones won by majority decision, the judges giving him 117–111,116–112 and 114–114.|$|E

Annie accuses Chris of ignoring her husband and son and the demands of the family business in favour of her newfound celebrity, while Chris believes Annie welcomes the Mother Teresa-like status to which she's been elevated that allows her to cater to the ill and bereaved who have bombarded her with fan mail. All is resolved eventually, and the women return home to resume life as it was before they removed their clothing.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} Jewish {{collaboration}} with the Soviet occupation remains controversial. Some scholars note that while not pro-Communist, many Jews saw the Soviets as the lesser threat compared to the German Nazis. They stress that stories of Jews welcoming the Soviets on the streets, vividly remembered by many Poles from {{the eastern part of}} the country are impressionistic and not reliable indicators of the level of Jewish support for the Soviets. Additionally, it has been noted that some ethnic Poles were as prominent as Jews in filling civil and police positions in the occupation administration, and that Jews, both civilians and in the Polish military, suffered equally at the hands of the Soviet occupiers. Whatever initial enthusiasm for the Soviet occupation Jews might have felt was soon dissipated upon feeling the impact of the suppression of Jewish societal modes of life by the occupiers. The tensions between ethnic Poles and Jews as a result of this period has, according to some historians, <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> on relations between Poles and Jews throughout the war, creating until this day, an impasse to Polish-Jewish rapprochement.|$|E

500|$|Aspects of her {{personal}} life are also revealed, including {{her relationship with her}} ex-colonel father; serving as Batwoman's ally, whom she addresses as [...] "sir." [...] The strain of her late night vigilante activity has also <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> on her romantic relationships. Her lateness and night time absences are interpreted by her girlfriend as an on the side liaison with another woman. She breaks the relationship off as she believes Kate is not ready to commit to an exclusive relationship. A past traumatic incident is also alluded to which she claims still haunts her. As she vaguely describes the experience, her face is shown superimposed on the page over a restrained girl with a bag over her head. She later tracks down the new leader of the Religion of Crime: an elaborately costumed woman named Alice. Over the course of the conflict that ensues, Batwoman observes that Alice only speaks in quotations from Lewis Carroll, believing herself to be Alice Liddell. Alice denies a connection to the Mad Hatter.|$|E
500|$|Dowling {{joined the}} Australian {{contingent}} at {{the surrender of}} Japan in Tokyo Bay on 2September 1945. Following the cessation of hostilities, Hobart became flagship of HM Australian Squadron, and Dowling flag captain and {{chief of staff to}} Commodore John Collins, the squadron commander. The war had <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> on Dowling's health, and he required leave before commencing his next appointment in May 1946 as Director of Ordnance, Torpedoes and Mines at the Navy Office. Rear Admiral James Goldrick, in the Australian Dictionary of Biography, observed that Dowling [...] "was thrust into the highest positions of the RAN {{largely as a result of}} the heavy casualties of World WarII". When John Armstrong—the only similarly qualified and more senior Navy captain—was pronounced unfit for seagoing duty, Dowling was given the chance to command Australia's first aircraft carrier, , commissioned in England on 16December 1948. In April the following year, two months after the ship's belated acceptance into service due to teething troubles, Dowling embarked Sydney for Australia with two squadrons of fighters aboard. In June 1950, he was promoted to commodore and appointed Second Naval Member and Chief of Naval Personnel, serving in this capacity until the end of 1952. His term coincided with the outbreak of the Korean War, and resultant increased demands on manpower. Dowling was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1953 New Year Honours, before travelling to London to attend the Imperial Defence College. Raised to rear admiral in July 1953, he returned home to take up the post of Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet that December, serving through the following year. He had [...] to preside over cutbacks to operations brought on by government stringency after the end of the Korean War.|$|E

Gibbs served as Post Commander of Fort Harker, Ks on four different occasions from January of 1867 to December of 1868.
