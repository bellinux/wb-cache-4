Some brewers choose to work only with LME, because <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> works best for the result they wish to achieve. Also, it requires one fewer processing step, so it is appealing to those favoring the purest form of product available. However, it is very sticky and, therefore, messier to work with and has a shorter shelf life, and some feel the results are just as good with DME.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 2010s, Kreuzlingen's {{downtown}} began {{to experience a}} dearth of shoppers as many of them, including buses from elsewhere in Switzerland that pass through the city, started crossing the border to shop in Konstanz instead, due to lower prices for basic items in Germany, a favorable exchange rate between the euro and the franc and a German VAT refund that allows shoppers from non-European Union countries such as Switzerland to get back {{as much as a}} fifth of the price of the goods they buy. Elected officials from the city have asked the national government to negotiate a change in this policy with their German counterparts as <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> is anti-competitive; at the same time some Konstanz residents, feeling displaced in their own hometown by the onslaught of Swiss on weekends, have opened businesses in Kreuzlingen that primarily cater to other Germans.|$|E

25|$|When {{comparing}} the sexual self-concepts of adolescent girls and boys, {{researchers found that}} boys experienced lower sexual self-esteem and higher sexual anxiety. The boys stated they were less able to refuse or resist sex at a greater rate than the girls reported having difficulty with this. The authors state {{that this may be}} because society places so much emphasis on teaching girls how to be resistant towards sex, that boys don’t learn these skills and are less able to use them when they want to say no to sex. They also explain how society’s stereotype that boys are always ready to desire sex and be aroused may contribute to the fact that many boys may not feel comfortable resisting sex, because it is something society tells them they should want. Because society expects adolescent boys to be assertive, dominant and in control, they are limited in how <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> is appropriate to act within a romantic relationship. Many boys feel lower self-esteem when they can’t attain these hyper-masculine ideals that society says they should. Additionally, there is not much guidance on how boys should act within relationships and many boys {{do not know how to}} retain their masculinity while being authentic and reciprocating affection in their relationships. This difficult dilemma is called the double-edged sword of masculinity by some researchers.|$|E

The DM selects and describes the various non-player characters (NPCs) that the party encounters, the settings in which these interactions occur, and the outcomes of those encounters based on the players' choices and actions. Encounters often take the form of battles with [...] "monsters"– a generic term used in D to describe potentially hostile beings such as animals, aberrant beings, or mythical creatures. The game's extensive rules– which cover diverse subjects such as social interactions, magic use, combat, and the effect of the environment on PCs– help the DM to make these decisions.

2500|$|In 1994, the Ninth Circuit {{held that}} Sikh {{students}} {{in public school}} {{have a right to}} wear the kirpan. State courts in New York and Ohio have ruled in favor of Sikhs who faced the rare situation of prosecution under anti-weapons statutes for wearing kirpans, [...] "because of the kirpan's religious nature and Sikhs' benign intent in wearing them."

Since the tightening of air travel security in the twenty-first century, the Sikh practice of wearing a Kirpan has caused problems for security personnel at airports and other checkpoints; they may confiscate kirpans if <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> is necessary, but are advised to treat them with respect.|$|E

2500|$|Specific {{plans were}} {{announced}} by Mr Blunkett on 7 May 2003. The new law applies to murders committed on or after 18 December 2003.

The terms {{are in the}} form of standard [...] "starting points" [...] based on age and other factors, from which any increase or decrease is then made by the sentencing judge according to the circumstances of the crime and the offender. [...] "Aggravating and mitigating factors" [...] are also set out, which can cause the sentencing judge to adjust the sentence from the starting point. Under the 2003 act, the starting points are simply starting points - judges are then free to decide a minimum term of any length or a [...] "whole life" [...] sentence if <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> appropriate.

2500|$|Adolescence marks a time {{of sexual}} maturation, which manifests in social {{interactions}} as well. While adolescents may engage in casual sexual encounters (often referred to as hookups), most sexual experience {{during this period of}} development takes place within romantic relationships. Adolescents can use technologies and social media to seek out romantic relationships as <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> is a safe place to try out dating and identity exploration. From these social media encounters, a further relationship may begin. Kissing, hand holding, and hugging signify satisfaction and commitment. Among young adolescents, [...] "heavy" [...] sexual activity, marked by genital stimulation, is often associated with violence, depression, and poor relationship quality. This effect does not hold true for sexual activity in late adolescence that takes place within a romantic relationship. Some research suggest that there are genetic causes of early sexual activity that are also risk factors for delinquency, suggesting that there is a group who are at risk for both early sexual activity and emotional distress. For older adolescents, though, sexual activity in the context of romantic relationships was actually correlated with lower levels of deviant behavior after controlling for genetic risks, as opposed to sex outside of a relationship (hook-ups) ...|$|E
2500|$|Some Christians feel {{concerned}} about the modern celebration of Halloween because <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> trivializes– or celebrates– paganism, the occult, or other practices and cultural phenomena deemed incompatible with their beliefs.

If it is just a game, there is no harm in that." [...] In more recent years, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has organized a [...] "Saint Fest" [...] on Halloween. Similarly, many contemporary Protestant churches view Halloween as a fun event for children, holding events in their churches where children and their parents can dress up, play games, and get candy for free. To these Christians, Halloween holds no threat to the spiritual lives of children: being taught about death and mortality, and the ways of the Celtic ancestors actually being a valuable life lesson and a part of many of their parishioners' heritage. Christian minister Sam Portaro wrote that Halloween is about using [...] "humor and ridicule to confront the power of death".|$|E

2500|$|Reeves and Nass {{explain that}} H. Paul Grice’s maxims for politeness {{are perhaps the}} most {{generally}} accepted rules on politeness communication and that Grice's rules are a vital basis to explaining the media equation. The four principles consist of Quality, Quantity, Clarity, and Relevance. Reeves and Nass used these principles to help explain how they believed computers could be social actors. Quality refers to how information presented in a conversation should have value, truth, and importance. Quantity refers to how speakers in interaction should present {{just the right amount of}} information to make the conversation as useful as possible. Too much or too little information may damage value of information. Reeves and Nass argue that quantity is not something social media executed very well; <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> causes frustration because computers display too much or too little information to humans when trying to communicate. Relevance refers to the content of information being translated into an interaction- this information should be both relevant and on-topic. Reeves and Nass argue that computers should be customizable so the user has control over relevance, and they observed how computers struggle to respond to wishes or goals of the user.|$|E
2500|$|The Harvard Law Review {{published}} a short piece called [...] "In The Face of Danger: Facial Recognition and Privacy Law", {{much of it}} explaining how [...] "privacy law, in its current form, is of no help to those unwillingly tagged." [...] Any individual can be unwillingly tagged in a photo and displayed {{in a manner that}} might violate them personally in some way, and by the time Facebook gets to taking down the photo, many people will have already had the chance to view, share, or distribute it. Furthermore, traditional tort law does not protect people who are captured by a photograph in public because this is not counted as an invasion of privacy. The extensive Facebook privacy policy covers these concerns and much more. [...] For example, the policy states that they reserve the right to disclose member information or share photos with companies, lawyers, courts, government entities, etc. if <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> absolutely necessary. [...] The policy also informs users that profile pictures are mainly to help friends connect to each other. [...] However, these, as well as other pictures, can allow other people to invade a person’s privacy by finding out information {{that can be used to}} track and locate a certain individual. In an article featured in ABC News, it was stated that two teams of scientists found out that Hollywood stars could be giving up information about their private whereabouts very easily through pictures uploaded to the Internet. [...] Moreover, it was found that pictures taken by some phones and tablets including iPhones automatically attach the latitude and longitude of the picture taken through metadata unless this function is manually disabled.|$|E
2500|$|VA-11 HALL-As {{developers}} {{come from}} Venezuela. As such, according to Ortiz, their {{visions of a}} dystopian bar scene are {{based on their own}} experiences of living in a third world country, leading them to create a cast of characters that, {{in the middle of a}} [...] "depressing society", try to go on with their lives and be as happy as they can with what they already have. Tenacity in the face of difficulty can be found in every character the player interacts with in the game, where despite [...] "each one surviving through varying degrees of hardship, they describe their problems not with bitterness but with an undertone of perseverance" [...] and a certain [...] "burning desire to be happy" [...] notwithstanding their deteriorating surroundings. Damas describes Sukeban Games' titles as [...] "dramedies", or a fusion of drama and comedy, as <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> is something the game industry lacks and [...] "laughter in the middle of despair" [...] sums up their experiences of living in Venezuela. Ortiz and Damas noted that, compared to these real-life experiences, such as when a friend had to jump from rooftop to rooftop to escape the protests in San Cristóbal, [...] "VA-11 HALL-A is kind of tame in comparison". Two in-game apps, the [...] "danger/u/" [...] textboard and the [...] "Augmented Eye" [...] news site, mirrors much of Venezuela's problems into the game's world. Damas explained how they wished to create a more [...] "optimistic kind of dystopia", where the player is just [...] "a normal person living in an interesting future". Additionally, since VA-11 HALL-A is primarily about interaction with characters, the objective of the game is not to save the world but rather to become a part of it.|$|E
