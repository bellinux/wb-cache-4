40|$|International audienceA wavelet-based {{conditional}} analysis of unsteady flow and sound signals highlights {{the role of}} intermittent perturbations both in the sound generation and the unsteady field of an aerofoil tip leakage flow experiment. It is shown how the most probable flow perturbations generated at the pressure side <b>tip</b> <b>edge</b> are convected through the gap and swept downstream along the suction side past the trailing edge tip corner, where they radiate sound. The nascent sound sources are identified and localized in the clearance between 40 % and 60 % of the chord. It is {{also found that the}} time dependence of the averaged intermittent structures scales with the inverse of the square root of the mean velocity and a physical interpretation based on a simple potential vortex model is proposed. The data are retrieved from an experiment that has been carried out at low Mach number (Ma < 0. 3) in an anechoic test facility. A single motionless instrumented NACA 5510 aerofoil was mounted into the potential core of an open rectangular jet between two plates with an adjustable clearance. The tip leakage flow was ensured by the 5 % camber and a 15 ° angle of attack. A large database obtained by a variety of measurement techniques is thus available for the present analysis. More specifically, the conditional approach is applied to joint far field, wall pressure and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements. The wall pressure probes are located along the suction side <b>tip</b> <b>edge</b> and on the tip inside the gap, whereas the PIV plane is parallel to the mid-gap plane. Additional joint wall pressure and single hot-wire anemometry (HWA) measurements are also analysed with a hot-wire probe located near the trailing edge tip corner.

[...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Health Sciences, 2012 This {{retrospective}} {{research study}} evaluated the skeletal, dental, soft tissue profile and occlusal changes {{that took place}} in the craniofacial structures in the correction of Class II malocclusions using the <b>Tip</b> <b>Edge</b> technique and involving the extraction of first-premolars. These data were compared with those reflecting changes {{that took place in}} a similar sample which had been treated using an Edgewise technique and including the extraction of first premolars. Thirty Tip- Edge and thirty Edgewise cases were studied. Pre-treatment and end of treatment cephalograms of both samples were examined. Soft and hard tissue landmarks were identified and traced on each cephalogram. Twenty-four measurements were read using a special digital computerized system. The data were analyzed with the intention of determining the relative efficacy of the two treatment techniques under comparison. Data reflecting a one-year follow-up of the <b>Tip</b> <b>Edge</b> cases were also evaluated to assess the clinical stability as well as the cephalometric changes that had taken place. The changes in these data were statistically analysed and statistically compared. The second part of this research examined the characteristics of occlusion demonstrated on the pre- and post- treatment study models of both samples and graded the occlusions using the eleven components of the Peer Assessment Rating (PAR Index). The data were statistically analyzed to identify the degree of change that had occurred, pre- to post- treatment and to compare the changes effected by the two techniques. The first part of this study demonstrated that treatment with the Tip-Edge technique produced changes similar to those demonstrated by the Edgewise sample following treatment. However, the Tip-Edge cases enjoyed far greater incisal retraction than did the Edgewise cases. The upper incisor to NA and the lower incisor to NB angles for the Edgewise samples remained almost unchanged following treatment. The lower incisors in the Tip-Edge sample were positioned almost ideally after treatment. In the <b>Tip</b> <b>Edge</b> cases, the mandibular length increased on average by 7 mm and this change was highly significant. The Edgewise cases demonstrated a decrease in maxillary length whereas the Tip-Edge cases displayed continuous growth during treatment. It appears that the maxilla was held back by the use of extra-oral traction in the Edgewise sample. The use of light elastic forces in the Tip-Edge sample does not appear to impede maxillary growth. The Y-axis, mandibular plane, occlusal plane and palatal planes were not altered to any significant extent in either technique, although the mandibular plane decreased in the Edgewise sample. Examination of the Tip-Edge cases one- year post-treatment demonstrated stability of the treatment effects and in some parameters, there were favourable improvements following “settling-in”. The Tip-Edge and Edgewise samples both exhibited similar favourable soft tissue changes. The assessment of occlusal characteristics demonstrated an average PAR index improvement of 90...|$|E

40|$|Root {{resorption}} is {{a common}} problem encountered in all branches of dentistry but is more commonly seen in cases that had been treated orthodontically. Orthodontists are constantly improving materials and techniques to reduce undesirable side effects like root resorption. Therefore in this retrospective study the primary objective was to compare the amount of root resorption observed after active orthodontic treatment with three different appliance systems namely, <b>Tip</b> <b>Edge,</b> Modified Edgewise and Damon. The sample consisted of pre and post-treatment cephalograms of sixty eight cases that were treated in three different groups (i. e., techniques). Root resorption of the maxillary central incisor was assessed from pre- and post- treatment lateral cephalograms using two schemes. In the first method overall tooth length (Black, 1902) from the incisal edge to the apex was measured on both pre and post-treatment lateral cephalograms and root resorption was recorded as an actual millimetre loss of tooth length. Percentage shortening per tooth was also recorded. The results were subjected to various statistical analyses. There was a significant upward linear trend (p= 0. 022) for root resorption from Group 1 (<b>Tip</b> <b>Edge)</b> to Group 3 (Damon). Statistical modeling illustrated that only baseline length (pre-treatment incisor length) was a significant confounder. Gender, race, age and treatment time {{did not have a}} significant influence on the amount of root resorption seen after orthodontic treatment. In the final analysis after having adjusted for baseline length it was found that {{there were no significant differences}} (p= 0. 133; ANCOVA) in the degree of root resorption observed after the active phase of orthodontic treatment between groups. Similarly the percentage of root resorption calculated did not differ significantly between groups (p= 0. 067). The result was also confirmed by following a non-parametric approach by doing an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in which data was allocated a rank value. In the second method root resorption was visually evaluated by using the five grade ordinal scale of Levander and Malmgren (1988). It was found that majority of cases in the sample came under Grade 1 and Grade 2 category of root resorption. The upward linear trend between actual measurements and visual measurements was found to be statistically significant (p= 0. 0183) ...|$|E
40|$|Research {{which was}} {{conducted}} to determine the significance of vortex age as a scaling parameter in wake turbulence development and dissipation is reported. Tests were conducted at three angles of attack, three free stream speeds, and seven downstream positions from 2 to 30 chordlengths using an NACA 0012 wing and a five hole yawhead pitot probe. The end surface of the wing tip was flat. Speeds were selected to give a predetermined range of vortex ages. The complete velocity structure of the vortex was measured at each station and speed. The resulting plots of maximum tangential velocity and vortex core diameter versus downstream distance and vortex age indicate that vortex age is not a self sufficient scaling parameter. In addition to the expected effect of lift coefficient {{there is also a}} definite free stream speed influence at high wing angles of attack.

40|$|End milling is a {{very common}} metal cutting process used for the {{machining}} of most types of metal. The process is inherently intermittent causing the tool <b>tip</b> <b>edge</b> to constantly fluctuate between various levels of temperatures, specifically from cold to 300 oC when cutting Al alloy. During dry end milling cutting temperatures need to remain within the design specifications of the tool tip. Even working with Al alloy the tool tip is subjected to thermal cyclic stresses. Conventional wisdom states that {{it is essential to}} use flood cooling during end milling, as intermittent cooling increases the effect of thermal shock and build up edge. Al alloy - unlike other materials - needs cutting fluid to avoid smearing the insert edges and to improve the surface finish. Modern machining companies constantly face the challenges of environmental issues that affect the manufacturing costs of machined parts. New environmental manufacturing techniques need to be developed for companies to remain competitive in the future. The research presented in this paper represents the experimentation involved in determining a suitable environmental alternative to using copious amounts of cutting fluid during end milling of Al alloy.

40|$|The tips of {{gas turbine}} rotor blade {{experience}} large thermal loads, {{which can lead}} to tip damage. The large thermal loads on the tips of rotor blade are due to the hot leakage flow through the gap between rotating blade tip and stationary shroud. The hot leakage flow accelerates due to the large pressure difference between the pressure and suction sides of blade, resulting a thin boundary layer and high heat transfer rates. The flow across the blade tip is also undesirable from the perspective of efficiency since it increases the loss of turbine power. For this reason, squlealer-type tip is used to reduce the leakage flow. Rim and groove increase the flow resistance of the leakage flow, resulting decrease of the leakage flow rate. However, the thermal loads and stresses are concentrated in the <b>tip</b> <b>edge</b> of rotor blade and occur crack and breakage. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} understand the heat transfer characteristics on surfaces inside the cavity of the squealer tip, such as tip surface and inner rim surface. Kwak et al.

40|$|An optical {{frequency}} comb {{is a series}} of equally spaced frequency components. It has gained much attention since Nobel physics prize was awarded John L. Hall and Theodor W. Hänsch for their contribution to the {{optical frequency}} comb technique in 2005. The optical frequency comb has been extensively studied because of its precision as a tool for spectroscopy, and is now widely used in bio- and chemical sensors, optical clocks, mode-locked dark pulse generation, soliton generation, and optical communication. Recently, thanks to the developments in nanotechnology, the optical frequency comb generation is made possible at a chip-scale level with microresonators. However, because the threshold power of the optical frequency comb generation is beyond the capability of the on-chip laser source, efficient microresonator is required. Here, we demonstrate an ultra-compact and highly efficient strip-slot direct mode coupler, aiming to achieve slotted silicon microresonator cladded with nonlinear polymer Poly-DDMEBT in SOI platform. As an application of the strip-slot direct mode coupling, a double slot fiber-to-chip edge coupler is demonstrated showing 2 dB insertion loss reduction compared to the conventional single <b>tip</b> <b>edge</b> coupler. For silicon nitride platform, we investigated evanescent wave coupling of microresonator, focusing on bus waveguide geometry optimization.
