5|$|Hela and {{the rest}} of the fleet {{anchored}} off Helgoland on 811 September. During the day the ships conducted training with steam tactics. On 11 September the ships returned to Wilhelmshaven where on the following two days the ships replenished their coal supplies. On 14 September the final operation of the annual maneuvers began. The situation specified that the naval war had gone badly for Germany; only four battleships were still in service, along with Hela, Freya, and a division of torpedo boats. The ships were to be stationed in the mouth of the Elbe river to protect the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and access to Hamburg. On 15 September, <b>the</b> <b>hostile</b> force blockaded the Elbe, along with other rivers and harbors on the North Sea. The torpedo boats, which had been scattered in the previous engagement, were tracked and destroyed by <b>the</b> <b>hostile</b> force. <b>The</b> <b>hostile</b> battleship squadron steamed to the mouth of the Elbe, where Hela, Freya, and the remaining torpedo boats were stationed as lookouts. Nothing happened during the day of 16 September, but that night several German torpedo boats managed to destroy one of the blockading cruisers and badly damage another. The following day, Prinz Heinrich engaged Hela and Freya briefly before forcing the two ships to retreat. The weather began to storm so the operation was postponed until the following day. That morning, <b>the</b> <b>hostile</b> fleet forced its way into the Elbe, past the fortifications at the mouth of the river. The German flotilla made a desperate attack which resulted in the sinking of two of <b>the</b> <b>hostile</b> battleships. <b>The</b> <b>hostile</b> force, however, ultimately overwhelmed the outnumbered German ships and the exercise ended with their victory.|$|E

5000|$|When the Dharma Initiative {{arrived on}} the Island, they fought with the Island's natives, known to them as <b>the</b> <b>Hostiles</b> and to <b>the</b> {{survivors}} of Flight 815 as the [...] "Others". The [...] "Hostiles" [...] had been living on the Island long before the Initiative arrived. The Arrow Station was eventually given a mission to observe and formulate strategies to counter <b>the</b> <b>Hostiles.</b> When Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) {{arrived on the}} Island in 1970, there was still an open conflict between <b>the</b> <b>Hostiles</b> and <b>the</b> Dharma Initiative. At some point prior to 1974, a truce of some kind was brokered with <b>the</b> <b>Hostiles.</b> A series of protocols were put into place between <b>the</b> <b>Hostiles</b> and <b>the</b> Initiative. Several episodes mention {{that there was a}} [...] "line" [...] and that certain parts of the Island were considered to be the [...] "territory" [...] of each group. This conflict ended in 1992, when Linus joined <b>the</b> <b>Hostiles,</b> who killed <b>the</b> Initiative, an event which became known as [...] "The Purge". The bodies were buried in a mass grave.|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the extent}} of oppression, and destitution, many Zoroastrians ventured to the {{hazardous}} journey to India.

In India, they were recognized for Sedreh and Kushti and were sheltered by their Parsi brethren. There, they formed the second major Indian Zoroastrian community known as the Iranis.|$|E
5|$|In August 1874, Carpenter became {{involved}} in fighting at Anadarko Reservation, Wichita, Indian Territory. This fighting is considered {{the first of many}} clashes during the Red River War (1874–75). Carpenter, with Troops H & I was sent to support Fort Sill and by using aggressive patrols engaged several Kiowa and Comanche raiding parties. The relatively peaceful Wichita Indians on the reservation were targets of <b>the</b> <b>hostile</b> Indians because of their increasing positive status under pacification.|$|E

5|$|The {{traditional}} approach to Arctic exploration had relied on large-scale forces, with a presumption that European techniques could be successfully transplanted into <b>the</b> <b>hostile</b> polar climate. Over the years this strategy had brought little success, and {{had led to}} heavy losses of men and ships. By contrast, Nansen's method of using small, trained crews, and harnessing Inuit and Sami expertise in his methods of travel, had ensured that his expedition was completed without a single casualty or major mishap.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} later, {{in the wake}} of the scandal, Waugh was widely jeered by an Australian crowd when he walked out to bat on the first day of the Test. In what he {{described}} as the toughest day of his career, Waugh gave an unconvincing and hesitant performance. Waugh managed only seven runs in 36 minutes before being removed by Peter Such, caught and bowled. The cricket writer Peter Roebuck opined that it was the worst home crowd reception for an Australian player that he could remember. Warne was injured at the time and did not play, so he did not have to face <b>the</b> <b>hostile</b> crowd.|$|E

5|$|After Governor Adair's term {{expired in}} 1825, he was succeeded by another Relief Party member, General Joseph Desha. Desha and Sharp had been colleagues in Congress, and Desha re-appointed Sharp as {{attorney}} general. The Relief faction {{in the legislature}} passed several measures favorable to debtors, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals struck them down as unconstitutional. Unable to muster the votes to remove <b>the</b> <b>hostile</b> justices on the Court of Appeals, Relief partisans in the General Assembly passed legislation to abolish the entire court and create a new one, which Governor Desha promptly stocked with sympathetic judges. For a time, two courts claimed authority as Kentucky's court of last resort; this period {{was referred to as}} the Old Court-New Court controversy.|$|E

After several reporters derisively laughed at these comments, Đính stormed out of the conference.|$|E

Aratus met Antigonus at Pagae, where he was pressured by Antigonus into giving Megara to Boeotia. When Cleomenes heard of the Macedonian advance through Euboea, he abandoned his siege of Sicyon and constructed a trench and palisade running from Acrocorinth to the Isthmus.

Jardine offered to stop using bodyline if the team did not support him, but after a private meeting (not attended by Jardine or either of the team managers) the players released a statement fully supporting the captain and his tactics. Even so, Jardine would not have played in the fourth Test without the withdrawal of the unsportsmanlike accusation.|$|E
5|$|By 5 May 1536, {{the town}} council of Buena Esperanza had now lost all faith in Cerezeda and {{voted for the}} {{abandonment}} of Higueras {{and a return to}} Trujillo; Cerezeda opposed this decision, but the council forced him to sign off on the move. In the meantime, any party foraging outside of Buena Esperanza was ordered to consist of at least 20 members for defence from <b>the</b> <b>hostile</b> natives. A chaotic evacuation back to Trujillo began, and resentment against Cerezeda was such that he feared for his life and fled to Naco to seek refuge amongst friendly natives there. On 9 May, amidst this disordered Spanish retreat, García de Celís returned from Guatemala with news that help would soon be forthcoming.|$|E
