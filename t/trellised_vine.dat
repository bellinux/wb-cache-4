60|$|And {{this change}} of feeling {{involves}} two others, very important. When {{the flowers and}} grass were regarded as means of life, and therefore (as the thoughtful laborer of the soil must always regard them) with the reverence due to those gifts of God which were most necessary to his existence; although their own beauty was less felt, their proceeding from the Divine hand was more seriously acknowledged, and the herb yielding seed, and fruit-tree yielding fruit, though in themselves less admired, were yet solemnly connected in the heart with the reverence of Ceres, Pomona, or Pan. But when the sense of these necessary uses {{was more or less}} lost, among the upper classes, by the delegation of the art of husbandry to the hands of the peasant, the flower and fruit, whose bloom or richness thus became a mere source of pleasure, were regarded with less solemn sense of the Divine gift in them; and were converted rather into toys than treasures, chance gifts for gaiety, rather than promised rewards of labor; so that while the Greek could hardly have trodden the formal furrow, or plucked the clusters from the <b>trellised</b> <b>vine,</b> without reverent thoughts of the deities of field and leaf, who gave the seed to fructify, and the bloom to darken, the mediæval knight plucked the violet to wreathe in his lady's hair, or strewed the idle rose on the turf at her feet, with little sense of anything in the nature that gave them, but a frail, accidental, involuntary exuberance; while also the Jewish sacrificial system being now done away, as well as the Pagan mythology, and, with it, the whole conception of meat offering or firstfruits offering, the chiefest seriousness of all the thoughts connected with the gifts of nature faded from the minds of the classes of men concerned with art and literature; while the peasant, reduced to serf level, was incapable of imaginative thought, owing to his want of general cultivation. But on the other hand, exactly in proportion as the idea of definite spiritual presence in material nature was lost, the mysterious sense of unaccountable life in the things themselves would be increased, and the mind would instantly be laid open to all those currents of fallacious, but pensive and pathetic sympathy, which we have seen to be characteristic of modern times.|$|E

And in {{reasoning}} {{about the}} effect of mountains we are therefore under a difficulty like that which would occur to us if we had to determine the good or bad effect of light on the human constitution, in some place where all corporal exercise was necessarily in partial darkness, and only idle people lived in the light. The exercise might give an advantage to the occupants of the gloom, but we should neither be justified in therefore denying the preciousness of light in general, nor the necessity to the workers of the few rays they possessed; and thus I suppose the hills around Stratford, and such glimpses as Shakespere had of sandstone and pines in Warwickshire, or of chalk cliffs in Kent, to have been essential to the development of his genius. This supposition can only be proved false by the rising of a Shakespere at Rotterdam or Bergen-op-Zoom, which I think not probable; whereas, on the other hand, it is confirmed by myriads of collateral evidences. The matter could only be tested by placing for half a century the British universities at Keswick, and Beddgelert, and making Grenoble the capital of France; but if, throughout the history of Britain and France, we contrast the general invention and pathetic power, in ballads or legends, of the inhabitants of the Scottish Border with those manifested in Suffolk or Essex; and similarly the inventive power of Normandy, Provence, and the Bearnois with that of Champagne or Picardy, we shall obtain some convincing evidence respecting the operation of hills on the masses of mankind, and be disposed to admit, with less hesitation, that the apparent inconsistencies in the effect of scenery on greater minds proceed in each case from specialities of education, accident, and original temper, which {{it would be impossible to}} follow out in detail. Sometimes only, when the original resemblance in character of intellect is very marked in two individuals, and they are submitted to definitely contrary circumstances of education, an approximation to evidence may be obtained. Thus Bacon and Pascal appear to be men naturally very similar in their temper and powers of mind. One, born in York House, Strand, of courtly parents, educated in court atmosphere, and replying, almost as soon as he could speak, to the queen asking how old he was--"Two years younger than Your Majesty's happy reign!"--has the world's meanness and cunning engrafted into his intellect, and remains smooth, serene, unenthusiastic, and in some degree base, even with all his sincere devotion and universal wisdom; bearing, to the end of life, the likeness of a marble palace in the street of a great city, fairly furnished within, and bright in wall and battlement, yet noisome in places about the foundations. The other, born at Clermont, in Auvergne, under the shadow of the Puy de Dôme, though taken to Paris at eight years old, retains for ever the impress of his birthplace; pursuing natural philosophy with the same zeal as Bacon, he returns to his own mountains to put himself under their tutelage, and by their help first discovers the great relations of the earth and the air: struck at last with mortal disease; gloomy, enthusiastic, and superstitious, with a conscience burning like lava, and inflexible like iron, the clouds gather about the majesty of him, fold after fold; and, with his spirit buried in ashes, and rent by earthquake, yet fruitful of true thought and faithful affection, he stands like that mound of desolate scoria that crowns the hill ranges of his native land, with its sable summit far in heaven, and its foundations green with the ordered garden and the <b>trellised</b> <b>vine.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In two studies, we {{investigated}} {{the roles of}} explicit memory and attentional resources {{in the process of}} behavior-induced attitude change. Although most theories of attitude change (cognitive dissonance and self-perception theories) assume an important role for both mechanisms, we propose that behavior-induced attitude change can be a relatively automatic process that does not require explicit memory for, or consciously controlled processing of, the discrepancy between attitude and behavior. Using a free-choice paradigm, we found that both amnesics and normal participants under cognitive load showed as much attitude change as did control participants.

2500|$|While closely related, {{the terms}} <b>trellising,</b> pruning and <b>vine</b> {{training}} {{are often used}} interchangeably even though they refer to different things. Technically speaking, the trellis refers to the actual stakes, posts, wires or other structures that the grapevine is attached to. Some vines are allowed to grow free standing without any attachment to a trellising structure. Part of the confusion between <b>trellising</b> and <b>vine</b> training systems {{stems from the fact}} that vine training systems will often take on the name of the particular type of trellising involved. [...] Pruning refers to the cutting and shaping of the cordon or [...] "arms" [...] of the grapevine in winter which will determine the number of buds that are allowed to become grape clusters. In some wine regions, such as France, the exact number of buds is outlined by Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) regulations. During the summer growing season, pruning can involve removing young plant shoots or excess bunches of grapes with green harvesting. Vine training systems utilize the practice of trellising and pruning in order to dictate and control a grape vine's canopy which will influence not only the potential yield of that year's crop but also the quality of the grapes due to the access of air and sunlight needed for the grapes to ripen fully and for preventing various grape diseases.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Food Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The aim of {{the study}} was to provide the South African wine {{industry}} with guidelines for the production of Pinotage wines with optimal total antioxidant capacity (TAC), while retaining sensory quality. The contribution of individual phenolic compounds to the wine TAC is important in this regard. The wine TAC was measured with the 2, 2 -azino-di(3 -ethylbenzo-thiazoline-sulphonic acid radical cation) (ABTS +) scavenging assay. The contributions of individual phenolic compounds to the wine TAC were calculated from their content in the wines and the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) of pure phenolic standards. The effects of climate region, vine structure, enological techniques (pre-fermentation maceration, juice/skin mixing, addition of commercial tannins, extended maceration) and maturation (oak barrels, alternative oak products, oxygenation) on the phenolic composition, TAC and sensory quality of Pinotage wines were also investigated. The TEAC values of quercetin- 3 -galactoside, isorhamnetin and peonidin- 3 -glucoside were reported for the first time. TEAC values observed for most compounds were much lower than those reported previously, although TEAC values for gallic acid, caftaric acid, caffeic acid and kaempferol were consistent with some previous reports. Caftaric acid and malvidin- 3 -glucoside were the largest contributors to the wine TAC. The contents of monomeric phenolic compounds and procyanidin B 1, however, only explained a small amount (between 11 and 24 %) of the wine TAC, with the remaining TAC attributed to oligomeric and polymeric phenolic compounds and other unknown compounds. Some synergy between different monomeric phenolic compounds was also demonstrated. All the viticultural and enological factors investigated affected the phenolic composition of Pinotage wines, while the wine TAC was only affected by some treatments. Changes in wine TAC could not always be explained by changes in phenolic composition as the contribution of oligomeric, polymeric and unknown compounds could not be assessed, but could play a large role. Differences in wine colour were also difficult to explain due to the large number of factors involved and the dark wine colour, which made objective measurements difficult. The concentration of vitisin A, an orange-red pyranoanthocyanin, was increased consistently as a result of prefermentation maceration treatments and affected the wine colour of oxygenated wines. Increased wine TAC was observed when cultivating Pinotage grapes on bush vines and in cooler climatic regions, compared to cultivation on <b>trellised</b> <b>vines</b> in warmer climatic regions. All the climatic regions and vine structure treatments, however, resulted in wines with good sensory quality. In terms of enological techniques, pumping-over, as opposed to punching-down and rotor treatments, is not recommended as a juice/skin mixing technique, due to reduced wine TAC, colour and sensory quality. Pre-fermentation maceration, addition of commercial tannin preparations, and oak maturation using traditional and alternative treatments, resulted in improved sensory quality, but with no change in wine TAC. However, optimisation of the tannin addition protocol may result in increased wine TAC if additions are made after fermentation or higher dosages are used. Oxygenation of Pinotage wine needs further investigation to optimise the protocol, as improvements to the wine colour and fullness were observed for some treatments, but loss of sensory quality and TAC were observed in most cases...|$|R
50|$|The {{indigenous}} criollo species “soloman torbon” is {{the root}} stock which is grafted with the Chinese eggplant. It takes about 75 days for the grafting to be completed and {{to take out the}} seedling for transplanting; the yield from the grafted plant is generally about 30% more than from the non-grafted variety. Greenhouses in Taiwan and China produce two varieties of the grafted plants, Exporter 1 and Exporter 3, which are sold to the farmers at US$ 0.05 (2lps) per grafted plant without any profit margin, rotation of crops is widely practiced by the farmers; maize, Solanaceae and cucurbitaceae are the inter-crops used for crop rotation in the field. To control pests, barriers (wind breaks) of sorghum, king grass and sugar cane are created; nematodes is one of the pests which generally infests the agricultural lands, however the transplanted plants are resistant to this pest. In mainland China, planting of eggplant (as an open field vegetable) is done by plastic mulching and inter cropping with <b>trellised</b> cucurbit crops. <b>Vine</b> shades protect the crop during summer; however inter cropping is now less popular due to labor shortage.|$|R

In Bairrada, the traditional <b>vine</b> <b>trellising</b> has been compared with the Lys system. In both conduction systems has been evaluated the influence of qualitative cluster thinning at veraison. In Vinhos Verdes, in the system LYS 2 / 3, has been studied the effect of shoot density (29 and 20 for linear meter of canopy) and leaf removal associated to qualitative cluster thinning at veraison. In these three regions, two of them that are not traditional places for this variety, the ‘Touriga Nacional’ reached high levels of yield and quality, in adjusted technological itineraries. Cluster thinning reduced yield in all cases, as it was expectable, with gains of PAC only in Bairrada. In a general way, different levels of canopy management (leaf removal and shoot suppression) didn’t play an important role. In Dão, the greatest shoot density originated a higher yield, without quality decrease.
