40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} numerical {{studies on}} the cyclic behavior of connection between I-beam and a built-up box column.

The effect of the vertical rib plate's geometry and position {{on the behavior of}} moment connections was investigated.

50|$|The {{operation}} of the line has been problematic since its opening. Complaints of noise pollution by residents along the line have led to severe restrictions. Barely {{six months after the}} line's opening, train frequency had to be reduced. On November 1, 1998, the number of cars operating on the line was reduced from six to three. Up until 2007, the operating hours were limited to between 7 am and 9 pm only. Trains currently still operate with a speed limit of 25 km/h due <b>to</b> <b>flange</b> on the line's sharp curves.|$|E
50|$|Growing {{passenger}} figures quickly necessitated {{more powerful}} engines. In 1986 two larger locomotives were built, entering {{service for the}} 1987 season; these were the new 2-6-0+0-6-2 Garratt locomotive No 3 Norfolk Hero and the Bo-Bo diesel locomotive No 4 Norfolk Harvester. These two engines provided the main service, with Weasel in reserve and out-of-season use, whilst Pilgrim was sold. The need for a second high-powered steam engine was quickly established and locomotive No 5 arrived on loan in 1995. This engine, which was never owned by the railway, had marginally different gauge standards (the range of measurements of elements of the wheelsets of a vehicle, {{in addition to the}} strict gauge from flange <b>to</b> <b>flange),</b> and proved unsuitable, as the newly established practice of running in reverse from Walsingham to Wells meant that the engine led with its tender, and the slightly different measurements, coupled with the lighter weight of the leading tender, led to the tender regularly derailing. The engine was little used, and eventually withdrawn, and plans were made to replicate the highly successful Garratt design of Norfolk Hero, with an order placed for locomotive No 6 Norfolk Heroine, which entered service in 2010.|$|E
40|$|Indian Standard I-Sections {{consist of}} some {{sections}} of the same designation but of different unit weights. The only major change in geometry indicated in SP: 6 (1) - 1964 in these sections is the web thickness. The areas of such sections have been calculated by applying the corrections to the flange widths, considering the details of manufacturing process of such rolled steel sections given in IS 808 - 1989 (Reaffirmed 1989). It is found that the area of only one such I-Section, namely, ISWB 600 @ 145. 1 kg/m, of this category, is differing from the area given in SP: 6 (1) - 1964. It has also been found that the area of this section perfectly matches with the area given in SP: 6 (1) - 1964, if the correction <b>to</b> <b>flange</b> width due to the manufacturing process is neglected.

40|$|Bolted, {{segmented}} cylindrical shells are {{a common}} structural component in many engineering systems especially for aerospace launch vehicles. Segmented shells are often needed due to limitations of manufacturing capabilities or transportation issues related to very long, large-diameter cylindrical shells. These cylindrical shells typically have a flange or ring welded to opposite ends so that shell segments can be mated together and bolted to form a larger structural system. As the diameter of these shells increases, maintaining strict fabrication tolerances for the flanges to be flat and parallel on a welded structure is an extreme challenge. Local fit-up stresses develop in the structure due <b>to</b> <b>flange</b> mating-surface mismatch (flange waviness). These local stresses {{need to be considered}} when predicting a critical initial flaw size. Flange waviness is one contributor to the fit-up stress state. The present paper describes the modeling and analysis effort to simulate fit-up stresses due <b>to</b> <b>flange</b> waviness in a typical bolted, segmented cylindrical shell. Results from parametric studies are presented for various flange mating-surface waviness distributions and amplitudes I...|$|E

40|$|In {{the design}} of cold-formed steel purlins based on Eurocode 3, the lateral bending moment in the free flange of the purlin, when in tension, {{is assumed to be}} zero due <b>to</b> <b>flange</b> curling and second order effects.
