40|$|This {{research}} project {{deals with the}} electroretinogram (ERG) and {{the role played by}} <b>the</b> oscillatory potentials (<b>OPs)</b> in its generation.

Another claim would be that <b>the</b> <b>OPs</b> should be considered the primary electrical events produced by the retina and their summation would yield the b-wave. A pharmacological approach was chosen to investigate the OP-b-wave relationship. 2 -amino- 4 -phosphonobutyric acid (APB) and glycine were injected intravitreally in rabbits. Our results indicate that <b>the</b> b-wave and <b>OPs</b> demonstrate identical chemical sensitivity.

The exhibition focused on the perceptual aspects of art, which result both from the illusion of movement and the interaction of color relationships. Op art, also known as optical art, is a style present in some paintings and other works of art that use optical illusions. Op art is also closely akin to geometric abstraction and hard-edge painting.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>ops</b> and tps {{genes of}} Myxococcus xanthus have ca. 90 % DNA and amino acid {{sequence}} homology and {{are in the same}} orientation separated by a spacer region of only 1. 4 kilobases. The products of the two genes were found to cross-react immunologically, and both were capable of Ca 2 +-dependent self-assembly on the surface of myxospores. However, <b>the</b> <b>ops</b> and tps genes were expressed very differently during the developmental cycle of M. xanthus. The tps gene is induced early during fruiting body formation on a solid surface, and its product, protein S, is made in large quantities (up to 15 % of total protein synthesis). When the cells turn into myxospores, protein S is assembled on the outer surface of the spore. We have now also found it in much smaller quantities inside <b>the</b> spores. <b>The</b> <b>ops</b> gene, on <b>the</b> other hand, appears to be induced later in development, after the cells have sporulated, since <b>the</b> <b>ops</b> gene product was found only inside the spores.

40|$|A {{segment of}} DNA located between 131 and 311 base pairs (bp) {{upstream}} from the transcriptional start of <b>the</b> Myxococcus xanthus <b>ops</b> gene (- 131 to - 311) {{was shown to}} function as an upstream activation site (UAS) for developmentally regulated transcription from the tps gene promoter region. The activation of early developmental transcription by <b>the</b> <b>ops</b> UAS was independent of orientation and could be increased {{by the addition of}} a second copy of <b>the</b> UAS. <b>The</b> <b>ops</b> UAS segment continued to function when placed 1. 5 kbp upstream from the transcription initiation site.

Several specific ops UAS DNA-protein complexes were observed after incubation of this DNA segment with an extract of early developmental M. xanthus cells. Extracts of vegetative cells contained much less ops UAS-specific DNA-binding activity. When the distance between <b>the</b> tps and <b>ops</b> genes was increased from 2 to 15 kbp by insertion of a transduced segment of DNA, the amount of developmentally induced tps RNA was found to be about one-third that found in wild-type M. xanthus. Our observations suggest that the regulatory region of <b>the</b> <b>ops</b> gene functions not only to control ops gene expression but also to increase early developmental expression of the tps gene located about 2 kbp downstream on the M. xanthus chromosome...|$|R

The Concerto takes nearly an hour in performance. Number twelve of Op. 39 is a set of variations, Le festin d'Ésope (Aesop's Feast). The other components of Op. 39 are of a similar stature. Smith describes Op. 39 as a whole as [...] "a towering achievement, gathering... the most complete manifestation of Alkan's many-sided genius: its dark passion, its vital rhythmic drive, its pungent harmony, its occasionally outrageous humour, and, above all, its uncompromising piano writing." ...|$|E

500|$|Brigitte François-Sappey {{points out}} the {{frequency}} with which Alkan has been compared to Berlioz, both by his contemporaries and later. She mentions that Hans von Bülow called him [...] "the Berlioz of the piano", while Schumann, in criticising <b>the</b> <b>Op.</b> 15 Romances, claimed that Alkan merely [...] "imitated Berlioz on the piano." [...] She further notes that Ferruccio Busoni repeated the comparison with Berlioz in a draft (but unpublished) monograph, while Kaikhosru Sorabji commented that Alkan's Op. 61 Sonatine was like [...] "a Beethoven sonata written by Berlioz". Berlioz was ten years older than Alkan, but did not attend the Conservatoire until 1826. The two were acquainted, and were perhaps both influenced by the unusual ideas and style of Anton Reicha who taught at the Conservatoire from 1818 to 1836, and by the sonorities of the composers of the period of the French Revolution. They both created individual, indeed, idiosyncratic sound-worlds in their music; there are, however, major differences between them. Alkan, unlike Berlioz, remained closely dedicated to the German musical tradition; his style and composition were heavily determined by his pianism, whereas Berlioz could hardly play at the keyboard and wrote nothing for piano solo. Alkan's works therefore also include miniatures and (among his early works) salon music, genres which Berlioz avoided.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 1831, Chopin {{received}} the first major endorsement from an outstanding contemporary when Robert Schumann, reviewing <b>the</b> <b>Op.</b> 2 Variations in the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung (his first published article on music), declared: [...] "Hats off, gentlemen! A genius." [...] On 26 February 1832 Chopin gave a debut Paris concert at the Salle Pleyel which drew universal admiration. The critic François-Joseph Fétis wrote in the Revue et gazette musicale: [...] "Here {{is a young man}} who... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of piano music,... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else..." [...] After this concert, Chopin realized that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces. Later that year he was introduced to the wealthy Rothschild banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private salons (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite). By the end of 1832 Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite, and had earned the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz. He no longer depended financially upon his father, and in the winter of 1832 he began earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students from all over Europe. This freed him from the strains of public concert-giving, which he disliked.|$|E
