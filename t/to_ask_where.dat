500|$|Despite his success, Homer {{notices that}} his team members are {{starting}} to get overworked. He decides that the solution is to get them hammocks and visits Scorpio <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>where</b> he can purchase some. Scorpio begins to tell Homer of [...] "the Hammock district", but he is interrupted by some urgent business. It turns out that Scorpio is a criminal mastermind formulating a plot to take over the East Coast of the United States with a doomsday device, as he turns to a screen and threatens the United Nations Security Council by declaring that he has got hold of the doomsday device and that they have 72 hours to meet his demand of gold. To prove his intent, he blows up the 59th Street Bridge. Despite being in the same room, Homer appears oblivious to Scorpio's nefarious plan as he was looking outside the window.|$|E
500|$|Word that Lakes had {{notified}} Cope of his finds galvanized Marsh into action. When Marsh {{heard from}} Union Pacific Railroad workers W.E. Carlin and W.H. Reed about a vast boneyard northwest of Laramie in Como Bluff, Marsh sent his agent, Samuel Wendell Williston, {{to take charge}} of the digging. Cope, in response, learned of Carlin and Reed's discoveries and sent his own men to find bones in the area. The two scientists attempted to sabotage each other's progress. Cope was described as a genius and what Marsh lacked in intelligence, he easily made up for in connections—Marsh's uncle was George Peabody, a rich banker who supported Marsh with money, and a secure position at the Peabody Museum. Marsh lobbied John Wesley Powell to act against Cope and attempted to persuade Hayden to [...] "muzzle" [...] Cope's publishing. Both men tried to spy on the other's whereabouts and attempted to offer their collectors more money in the hopes of recruiting them to their own side. Cope was able to recruit David Baldwin in New Mexico and Frank Williston in Wyoming from Marsh. Cope and Marsh were extremely secretive as to the source of their fossils. When Henry Fairfield Osborn, at the time a student at Princeton, visited Cope <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>where</b> to travel to look for fossils in the West, Cope politely refused to answer.|$|E

500|$|Yashvardhan [...] "Yash" [...] Raichand (Amitabh Bachchan) {{is a rich}} {{business}} tycoon, {{living in}} Delhi with his wife Nandini (Jaya Bachchan) and two sons Rahul and Rohan. Rahul is the elder son and was adopted by Yash and Nandini at birth. This is known {{to everyone in the}} Raichand household, except Rohan. The Raichand household is highly patriarchal and follows traditions. While grown up, Rahul (Shahrukh Khan) comes across the vivacious Anjali Sharma (Kajol), and they eventually fall in love, but their love is forbidden, because Anjali is from a low-income background. Yash and Nandini soon send Rohan to a boarding school, which all the males in their family have attended. Yash announces his desire for Rahul to marry Naina (Rani Mukherji), as he believes that parents have the right to choose their offspring's spouse, but Naina learns that Rahul is in love with Anjali, and encourages him to pursue her. When Yash comes to know of this, he is enraged, and Rahul promises not to marry Anjali, as he wants to please his father. En route to tell her of his promise, he discovers that her father (Alok Nath) has died, and decides to marry her despite his father's hostility. Yash learns of the marriage and disowns Rahul, whereupon Nandini and Rahul share a tearful goodbye. Nandini sends Sayeeda (Farida Jalal) (Rahul and Rohan's nanny) to watch over him, so that he does not feel separated from a mother's love. Rahul visits Rohan in the Boarding School and begs of Rohan never <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>where</b> he went or why he left, and asks that he take care of Nandini.|$|E

Another Indian politician, Mulayam Singh Yadav, opposing {{the introduction of the}} death penalty for rape, said in April [...] "boys will be boys... they commit mistakes", gaining considerable notoriety, while in June politician and former actor Tapas Paul said he would send his [...] "boys" [...] to rape women from an opposing party.|$|E

2500|$|Breast cancer culture, or pink ribbon culture, is {{the set of}} activities, attitudes, {{and values}} that {{surround}} and shape breast cancer in public. The dominant values are selflessness, cheerfulness, unity, and optimism. [...] It is pro-doctor, pro-medicine, and pro-mammogram. Health care professionals are sources of information, but the rightness of their advice {{is not to be}} seriously questioned by women with breast cancer. Patients are not encouraged <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>where</b> research money is going or if the research industry is making progress in finding the [...] "cure". [...] The emphasis on cheerfulness allows society to blame women for developing breast cancer and limits their responses to certain culturally determined scripts. [...] The requirement of cheerful optimism arose from the theory that cancer had a psychosomatic origin and that people who were diagnosed with cancer had a [...] "cancer personality" [...] that was depressed, repressed, and self-loathing. Psychotherapy was therefore considered an adjunct treatment used to produce a cheerful, self-affirming identity. This theory was predominant among psychiatrists through the 1970s, but has since been discredited. [...] In a process called benefit finding, the she-ro uses the emotional trauma of being diagnosed with breast cancer and the suffering of extended treatment to transform herself into a stronger, happier and more sensitive person who is grateful for the opportunity to become a better person. In particular, she sees breast cancer as an opportunity to give herself permission for necessary personal growth that she felt she was prohibited from or unable to make before. Breast cancer thereby becomes a rite of passage rather than a disease, with pink ribbon culture honoring the suffering of its she-roes by selecting them based on the amount of misery they have experienced and leading women whose treatment is less painful or debilitating to feel excluded and devalued. The suffering, particularly the extended suffering of months of chemotherapy and radiation treatment, forms a metaphorical type of ordeal or rite of passage that initiates women into the inner circle of breast cancer culture.
