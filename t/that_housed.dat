40|$|I want {{to share}} with you tonight six housing policy lessons learned from the past that can be {{directly}} applied to the future. The first is <b>that</b> <b>housing</b> policy can work, and sometimes does. The second lesson is <b>that</b> <b>housing</b> equals jobs. The third lesson is <b>that</b> <b>housing</b> and commu­ nity development go together. The fourth lesson is <b>that</b> <b>housing</b> and supportive services go together. The fifth lesson is <b>that</b> <b>housing</b> can bring people together-and sometimes does. And the sixth is that part­ nerships are the housing policy of the future. Let me elaborate on each of these poi nts...|$|R

It features replicas of three buildings that stood on the original city square, including the courthouse <b>that</b> <b>housed</b> ten constitutional conventions between 1785 and 1792; these conventions ultimately led to Kentucky's separation from Virginia. It also includes the original building <b>that</b> <b>housed</b> the first U.S. post office west of the Allegheny Mountains and several other early 19th century buildings of historical import. The site comprises {{the majority of the}} Constitution Square Historic District which was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 2, 1976. Among the annual events held at the site are the Great American Brass Band Festival and the Kentucky State Barbecue Festival.|$|E
5|$|A {{temple was}} {{constructed}} in AD60–70, and a bathing complex was built up over the next 300years. Engineers drove oak piles into the mud to provide a stable foundation, and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead. In the 2nd century, the spring was enclosed within a wooden barrel-vaulted structure <b>that</b> <b>housed</b> the caldarium (hot bath), tepidarium (warm bath), and frigidarium (cold bath).|$|E

5|$|Neither the {{clockwork}} {{visible to}} {{the left side of the}} machine nor the drawer <b>that</b> <b>housed</b> the chess set extended fully to the rear of the cabinet; they instead went only one third of the way. A sliding seat was also installed, allowing the director inside to slide from place to place and thus evade observation as the presenter opened various doors. The sliding of the seat caused dummy machinery to slide into its place to further conceal the person inside the cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The {{document}} was then {{deposited in the}} temple <b>that</b> <b>housed</b> the Treasury (the aerarium). While a senatus auctoritas (vetoed Senate motion) had no legal value, it did serve to show {{the opinion of the}} Senate. If a senatus consultum conflicted with a law (lex) that was passed by a Roman Assembly, the law overrode the senatus consultum, because the senatus consultum had its authority based in precedent, and not in law. A senatus consultum, however, could serve to interpret a law.|$|E
50|$|Ministers of the Crown are {{responsible}} to the House {{in which they}} sit; they make statements in <b>that</b> <b>House</b> and take questions from members of <b>that</b> <b>House.</b> For most senior ministers this is usually the elected House of Commons rather than the House of Lords. There have been some recent exceptions to this: for example, cabinet ministers Lord Mandelson (First Secretary of State) and Lord Adonis (Secretary of State for Transport) sat in the Lords and were responsible to <b>that</b> <b>House</b> during the government of Gordon Brown.|$|R

There's no way they would not have found something," [...] Cindy Adams said. She also claims there was extensive coercion: [...] "In this statement Dylan is trying to tell his story as to what happened, and you've got this TBI agent saying, 'Don't you mean this? Don't you mean it happened like this?' And, 'No Dylan, it went down like this.' And you can honestly tell at the point that Dylan, I can as his mother, he gave up. He's like, 'OK, if that's what you said, OK," [...] Cindy Adams said.|$|R

5|$|The main Scarborough School building, Vanderlip Hall, was {{designed}} by William W. Bosworth, known for landscaping Kykuit and restoring Versailles. The school building was constructed in a severe, all-white Neoclassical style, and was completed early in 1917. In addition to a grand porticoed entry, there were two wings <b>that</b> <b>housed</b> classes, a library, cafeteria and gymnasium, basement science labs, and an art room measuring , ringed on three sides with French windows. In the 1960s, an additional Modernist structure was built across a stream that would ultimately house the school's lower grades.|$|E
5|$|Visible {{changes from}} the XF-104 to {{production}} {{versions of the}} Starfighter include a longer fuselage (to accommodate the J79 engine and extra internal fuel) and a forward-retracting nose landing gear (except two-seat versions) to increase clearance for the downward-ejecting seat. A ventral fin for increased stability was added during the YF-104A test program. Inlet shock cones and a fuselage spine fairing between the canopy and fin <b>that</b> <b>housed</b> fuel piping were further added features. Production aircraft would also feature a redesigned fin structure using stainless steel spars to eliminate the flutter problem.|$|E
5|$|Breslau {{was built}} in 1901 by the Bremer Vulkan yard at Vegesack for the North German Lloyd line as the fourth of seven ships of the Köln class. The Köln-class ships, all named after German cities, were {{designed}} for the Bremen to Baltimore and Galveston route, and were specially fitted for steerage traffic. Though the class was designed with accommodations for 120 cabin-class passengers and up to 1,850 steerage passengers for service from Germany, Breslaus capacity was somewhat lower, with room for 66 cabin-class and 1,660 in steerage. The Köln-class steerage compartments had portholes for better light and ventilation than was typical, and included cabins <b>that</b> <b>housed</b> from four to ten passengers. Köln-class ships were specially designed to carry large freight loads on return voyages to Germany, with holds customized for carrying wheat and cotton.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{hurricane}} and the widespread destruction, {{the hurricane}} caused outbreaks of malaria, dengue, cholera, and various fever and respiratory illnesses. Ongoing flooding caused {{an outbreak of}} Leptospirosis, notably in Cortés Department. There were widespread food and water shortages, leaving villagers near-starvation. Damaged crops also prevented the export of cash crops, and exports decreased by 9.4% in 1999. Many of the people left homeless also became unemployed, and there were reductions in exports and economic growth. Officials set up shelters <b>that</b> <b>housed</b> 285,000people for about a month. In Tegucigalpa, where the Choluteca River was dammed by a landslide, a temporary lagoon filled with sewage persisted for about two months, until a crew from the United States Army Corps of Engineers and United States Geological Survey dug a channel to drain the water.|$|E
5|$|Engadine was {{purchased}} in February 1915 by the Admiralty {{and she was}} modified by Cunard at Liverpool from 10 February to 23 March 1915 with a permanent, four-aircraft, hangar in the rear superstructure {{and a pair of}} cranes were mounted {{at the rear of the}} hangar to hoist the seaplanes in and out of the water. Four quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 12 cwt guns, each with 130 rounds, and two Vickers QF 3-pounder anti-aircraft guns, each with 65 rounds, were fitted for self-defence. She also carried a pigeon loft <b>that</b> <b>housed</b> carrier pigeons to be used by her aircraft if their wireless was broken.|$|E
5|$|Hardenbergh's {{design was}} {{described}} as employing both Gothic elements and classical forms that preceded the extreme eclecticism that was to mark a later Victorian Gothic Revival period. The original plans called for the building to be constructed out of red brick, but the final execution was mostly in sandstone quarried in Connecticut, with some examples of stone from Newark. Geology Hall, built {{on the south side}} of Old Queens, was the second of three projects that Hardenberg designed for the college, following an addition to a building (now Alexander Johnston Hall) <b>that</b> <b>housed</b> the college's grammar school (now Rutgers Preparatory School) the year before. The third project, Kirkpatrick Chapel (1873), was designed to complement the simple Gothic Revival style of Geology Hall and was erected on the north side of Old Queens.|$|E
