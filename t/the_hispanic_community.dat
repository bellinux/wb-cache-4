25|$|Tejada {{strove to}} {{reconstruct}} and define a Hispanic political tradition and vacillated between {{the role of}} historian and theorist. His understanding of Hispanidad {{was based on the}} concept of Las Españas, seen as embodied in confederal political shape but its essence having been pre-state commonality. Relying on the unity in diversity recipé and incorporating local traditions, including the fueros, Hispanic tradition consisted of two features: Catholic vision of life combined with missionary universalist spirit pursued by a federative monarchy. According to Tejada Hispanidad was born in the Middle Ages, climaxed during the early España de los Austrias and declined due to centralist French tradition imported by the Borbones. His recurring subject was confronting Hispanic and European traditions, the latter born out of anti-Catholic, revolutionary, modernist thought and ultimately responsible for breaking <b>the</b> <b>Hispanic</b> <b>community</b> by force.|$|E
