We validate our model through extensive simulations and derive the region of applicability—with respect to non-asymptotic settings of network utilization, heterogeneity in traffic composition, and number of hops that a flow traverses—of our model. We find that for flows that contribute significant amount (� 10 %) to the cumulative bit rate of the aggregate, the observations yielded by the model hold at relatively low levels of network utilization (30 - 40 %), small number of network hops (4 - 6), and moderate levels of heterogeneity in packet sizes and bandwidth requirements <b>of</b> <b>flows.</b> ...|$|R

Generally, a fair scheduler in a wireless network retains the virtual <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> when the flow encounters channel errors.

In this paper, we present a channel condition self-clocked packet scheduling scheme. This algorithm can address the problem and achieve the following goals: (1) steady delay and jitter for flows perceiving an error-free environment, (2) delay and throughput guarantees in an error-free environment, (3) short-term fairness among flows perceiving an error-free environment, and (4) long-term fairness for error system.
