50|$|While the <b>ships</b> <b>turbines</b> {{allowed the}} <b>ship</b> to reach very high speeds in trials, with {{low levels of}} vibration, fuel {{consumption}} was very high, and the <b>ships</b> <b>turbines,</b> which had been optimised for high speed, were inefficient at slower speeds.

50|$|Another {{technical}} {{improvement was}} {{the introduction of}} the steam turbine which greatly increased the performance of the ships. Earlier screw-powered capital ships were capable of perhaps 16 knots, but the first large <b>turbine</b> <b>ships</b> were capable of over 20 knots. Combined with the long range of the guns, this meant that the ships moved a considerable distance, several ship lengths, between the time the shells were fired and landed. One could no longer eyeball the aim with any hope of accuracy. Moreover, in naval engagements it is also necessary to control the firing of several guns at once.|$|R

5000|$|There were 21 {{ships in}} the Halcyon class, built in two groups; the first using {{reciprocating}} steam engines, with steam turbines in the latter.

5000|$|In the 1950s, the Maritime Administration instituted the Liberty Ship Conversion and Engine Improvement Program, {{which had}} a goal to {{increase}} the speed of Liberty ships to , making them competitive with more modern designs, as well as gaining experience with alternate propulsion systems. Four ships were converted in the $11 million program. [...] The SS Benjamin Chew had its existing condensers modified and a new superheater and geared turbine installed to give the ship 6,000 shp, up from 2,500. The SS Thomas Nelson had its bow lengthened, diesel engines installed in place of the original steam engine, and movable cranes outfitted in place of the original cargo handling gear. The GTS (Gas <b>Turbine</b> <b>Ship)</b> John Sergeant had its bow extended, and its steam engine replaced with a General Electric gas turbine of 6,600 shp, connected to a reversible pitch propeller via reduction gearing. John Sergeant was considered overall to be a success, but problems with the reversible pitch propeller ended its trial after 3 years. The GTS William Patterson had its bow extended and its steam engine replaced with 6 General Electric GE-14 free-piston gas generators, connected to two reversible turbines and capable of 6,000 shp total. William Patterson was considered to be a failure as reliability was poor and the scalability of the design was poor. [...] All four vessels were fueled with Bunker C fuel oil, though John Sergeant required a quality of fuel available at limited ports and also required further treatment to reduce contaminants. [...] Three were scrapped in 1971 or 1972 and the diesel-equipped Thomas Nelson was scrapped in 1981.|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{a systems}} engineering and design capstone project, {{directed by the}} Total Ship Systems Engineering (TSSE) faculty and undertaken by students in the TSSE program at the Naval Postgraduate School and performed over two academic quarters. It takes {{a fresh look at}} the basic design and operation of the modem aircraft carrier, assuming availability of short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft, employing gas <b>turbine</b> <b>ship</b> propulsion and providing significant capability to support humanitarian operations. In the design study reported here, the authors take a systems engineering approach to a totally new carrier design which may best suit the requirements for the next generation aircraft carrier. The central goal was to provide a ship to meet all of the current mission requirements of the existing Nimitz class carriers but in a platform that is significantly lower in life cycle costs. The outcome is a ship based on a concept called "super-island"; a large island structure that can provides drive-through "pit- stops" for aircraft refueling and rearming as well as other major functions. Other areas of major innovation include: weapons handling, information processing and distribution, engineering layout and manning. The report provides an overview of the major ship systems as well as detailed discussions of selected design areas chosen to illustrate those systems that had the most impact on meeting design goals...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{focus on}} {{reduction}} of CO 2 emissions, {{and the possibility}} of future severe shortage of oil have sparked renewed interest in wind as supplementary propulsion of merchant ships. Several alternative solutions are considered, like kites, conventional soft sails, rigid sails, Flettner rotors, and wind turbines. A tempting aspect of wind turbine propulsion is that it can provide propulsive force when sailing directly upwind, something that is impossible with the other mentioned forms of wind-assisted propulsion. A method based on axial momentum theory has been outlined, in order to predict the steady-state speed of a wind turbine powered boat. This method is applied to a notional wind turbine powered catamaran. The predicted boat speed to wind speed ratio when the boat is sailing upwind is in good agreement with results from testing of a similar, but smaller, full-scale wind turbine boat. A related topic to wind turbine propulsion is the reversed configuration, where a water turbine is driving an air propeller. This configuration allows for the theoretical possibility of sailing faster than the wind, directly downwind. Based on a similar approach to the method of velocity prediction of wind turbine powered boats, design criteria with respect to water turbine efficiency and hydrofoil chord length, are set for a given hydrofoil boat in order to sail faster than the wind, directly downwind. The design of optimal wind turbine blades for wind turbine powered vessels is studied. A 326 m L WL VLCC is equipped with a Vestas V 90 wind turbine for auxiliary propulsion, and set to sail a route across the North Sea. By employing the wind turbine, 3. 6 % of the fuel is saved when the ship is sailing at 15 kn. If the ship speed is reduced to 10 kn, the fuel saving increases to 21. 1 %. The optimal blade design theory is applied to the wind <b>turbine</b> <b>ship,</b> keeping the wind turbine diameter fixed at 90 m. The optimal blade design increases the fuel saving by a few percentage points. The main drawbacks for a wind turbine powered ship are shown to be the low ship speed to wind speed ratio in order for wind turbine propulsion to be the preferred form of wind-assisted propulsion, as well as the height of such a ship. Attached is a CD-ROM containing Matlab files used for creating various of the results in this thesis, as well as an electronic version of the thesis. </p...|$|E
