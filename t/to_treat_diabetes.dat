40|$|The {{advent of}} {{large-scale}} in vitro differentiation of human stem cell-derived insulin-producing cells (SCIPC) {{has brought us}} closer <b>to</b> <b>treating</b> <b>diabetes</b> using stem cell technology.

It is unclear to what extent human SCIPC are susceptible to ischemia. In this study, we show {{that more than half of}} SCIPC die shortly after transplantation. Nutrient deprivation and hypoxia acted synergistically to kill SCIPC in vitro. Amino acid supplementation rescued SCIPC from nutrient deprivation, likely by providing cellular energy. Generating SCIPC under physiological oxygen tension of 5 % conferred hypoxia resistance without affecting their differentiation or function. A two-pronged strategy of physiological oxygen acclimatization during differentiation and amino acid supplementation during transplantation significantly improved SCIPC survival after transplant...|$|R

40|$|Islet {{transplantation}} {{promises to}} provide safe, long-lasting insulin independence to individuals with di-abetes. Yet {{the need for}} lifelong immunosuppressioncoupled with a vastly insufficient supply of donor tissue continues to prevent the widespread application of this approach <b>to</b> <b>treating</b> <b>diabetes.</b> A study (1) {{in this issue of}} Diabetes describes significant progress in addressing both of these issues. Porcine islets have long been touted as a potentially unlimited source of transplantable islet tissue. Porcine and human insulin are highly homologous, and until the late 1970 s, with the advent of recombinant protein technology, porcine insulin was routinely injected into humans with diabetes. However, the transplantation of porcine tissue has not proven to be so straightforward. Over the past decade, nonhuman primate studies demonstrated that a strong im-munosuppression protocol was required to avoid rejection of porcine islet xenografts (2, 3).

40|$|Background: Obesity and {{physical}} inactivity are {{currently on the}} rise due to industrialization of the communities, which has recently led to increased incidence of different diseases such as diabetes. Epidemiological studies and figures have demonstrated the growing incidence of diabetes.
