5|$|An {{unpublished}} {{study conducted}} by Vernon Meidlinger-Chin in 2013 suggested <b>that</b> <b>previous</b> studies lacked focus on endocranial details. The {{study found that the}} Cryolophosaurus fossil has a nearly complete, undistorted cranial cavity which is complete enough to give an approximate shape and size of the living brain. The endocast features clarified the dissimilarity of the skull with those of Allosauroids and Coelurosaurs giving Cryolophosaurus a basal position in Theropoda.|$|E
5|$|Brodie {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>previous</b> historians had unduly vilified Stevens, and {{she enjoyed}} {{the prospect of}} rebuilding a reputation rather than, as in her Joseph Smith biography, tearing one down. Stevens {{as a champion of}} black people was a timely interest as the Civil Rights Movement increased in intensity. Research materials were available at Yale University, where Bernard Brodie was employed. Fawn Brodie wondered how Stevens had been affected psychologically by his physical deformity, a club foot.|$|E
5|$|Central to the {{reversal}} of the Ninth Circuit {{was the fact that}} the state court did not take into account Alvarado's age and experience with law enforcement in the custody analysis. The Court made several findings on this issue. The Court held that the use of age in custody analysis had not been explicitly required by previous rulings. Inexperience with law enforcement was rejected as well; the Court noted <b>that</b> <b>previous</b> opinions had rejected reliance on such factors.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{comments}} {{on a previous}} paper in this journal concerning EU endorsement of IFRS.

It is further suggested <b>that</b> the <b>previous</b> analysis of five accounting standards does not support the claim that the European Commission wrongly endorsed them. It is also argued here <b>that</b> the <b>previous</b> analysis of the nature of most gains under IFRS is faulty. ...|$|R

5|$|The Tevis novel {{had been}} optioned several times, {{including}} by Frank Sinatra, but attempts to adapt {{it for the}} screen were unsuccessful.

Rossen, who had hustled pool himself as a youth and who had made an abortive attempt to write a pool-themed play called Corner Pocket, optioned the book and teamed with Sidney Carroll to produce the script.|$|E

5|$|Whereas Milian's {{previous}} albums had pop and R stylings, she {{was encouraged}} by Island Def Jam to target a new audience and release an urban record. Explaining the change, Milian {{said that one of}} her main problems was <b>that</b> <b>previous</b> releases would often find mainstream success, but would be relatively unsuccessful on urban radio. As an R artist, she wanted to build her core audience–a true fan base that would support her through time–to increase her career's longevity.

5|$|As the company's only engineer, Bristow rapidly {{developed}} a prototype himself before turning the game over to new hire Lyle Rains {{to develop into}} a finished product, codenamed K2 Tank. Rains added the maze and central minefield to the game design and developed the final hardware, including the simple control scheme. Peter Takaichi designed a large custom cabinet to house it. Tank {{was one of the}} first games to use integrated circuit-based memory—specifically, mask ROM (read-only memory)—to store graphical data, rather than the diode arrays <b>that</b> <b>previous</b> arcade games used; it is sometimes claimed in sources to be the very first, but was preceded at minimum by Atari's Gran Trak 10 (1974). Integrated circuit-based memory thereafter became the standard for arcade and console video games. Before the game could be completed, in September 1974 Atari announced plans to merge itself and Kee Games back together; Tank was released that November just prior to the merger in December 1974.|$|E

5|$|In April 2009 it {{was decided}} by CITES that an {{in-depth}} review of the commercial dolphin trade conducted from the Solomon Islands should take place, this after the IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group {{came to the conclusion}} that insufficient population data exists to prove the sustainability of the wild captures and the current export quota of 100 animals per year. The Solomon Island Dolphin Abundance Project was established to provide data on the size of the local Indo-Pacific Bottlenose population and the sustainability of the dolphin hunts. A report published in March 2013 as a result of this effort indicated that the capture of dolphins in the Solomon Islands can only be sustainable at a very low rate and <b>that</b> <b>previous</b> rates of capture as seen between 2003 and 2013 would not be sustainable in the future.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{evidence}} for sexual dimorphism has been weakened. A 2005 study reported <b>that</b> <b>previous</b> claims of sexual dimorphism in crocodile chevron anatomy were in error, casting {{doubt on the}} existence of similar dimorphism between Tyrannosaurus rex sexes. A full-sized chevron was discovered on the first tail vertebra of Sue, an extremely robust individual, indicating that this feature could not be used to differentiate the two morphs anyway. As Tyrannosaurus rex specimens have been found from Saskatchewan to New Mexico, differences between individuals may be indicative of geographic variation rather than sexual dimorphism. The differences could also be age-related, with 'robust' individuals being older animals.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's work on The Plays of William Shakespeare took {{up most of}} his time. On 8 June 1756, Johnson {{published}} his Proposals for Printing, by Subscription, the Dramatick Works of William Shakespeare, which argued <b>that</b> <b>previous</b> editions of Shakespeare were edited incorrectly {{and needed to be}} corrected. Johnson's progress on the work slowed as the months passed, and he told music historian Charles Burney in December 1757 that it would take him until the following March to complete it. Before that could happen, he was arrested again, for a debt of £40, in February 1758. The debt was soon repaid by Jacob Tonson, who had contracted Johnson to publish Shakespeare, and this encouraged Johnson to finish his edition to repay the favour. Although it took him another seven years to finish, Johnson completed a few volumes of his Shakespeare to prove his commitment to the project.|$|E

Eventually, Munson, worried that his wife will find where he has hidden the money, enlists Sawyer's help in moving the stash. Sawyer then reveals this {{information}} to the warden in exchange for a reduced sentence and a part of the money, which he puts in a bank account for Clementine Phillips, a baby <b>that</b> <b>previous</b> con victim Cassidy Phillips (Kim Dickens) has told him is his daughter.

5|$|Since 1998, archaeological {{techniques}} such as field walking {{have led to the}} discovery of finds ranging in age from prehistoric flints and Bronze Age axe heads to Roman and late medieval finds. Featuring prominently amongst these finds were Roman artefacts including coins, brooches and a snake bracelet. At the invitation of local historian Jim Balme, Time Team excavated in Warburton in September 2006. They were searching for a Roman fortlet <b>that</b> <b>previous</b> archaeological digs by South Trafford Archaeological Group (STAG) indicated might be present. Though no evidence of a Roman fortlet was found, the discovery of strip lynchets indicates that there was a Romano-British farm in Warburton. The presence of Roman finds was explained as rubbish, mixed in with manure to be spread on the crops.|$|E
5|$|The {{prospect}} of developing such large tourist accommodations has encountered concerns from both APSARA and the ICC, claiming <b>that</b> <b>previous</b> tourism {{developments in the}} area have neglected construction regulations and more of these projects {{have the potential to}} damage landscape features. Also, the large scale of these projects have begun to threaten the quality of the nearby town's water, sewage, and electricity systems. It has been noted that such high frequency of tourism and growing demand for quality accommodations in the area, such as the development of a large highway, has had a direct effect on the underground water table, subsequently straining the structural stability of the temples at Angkor Wat. Locals of Siem Reap have also voiced concern that the charm and atmosphere of their town have been compromised in order to entertain tourism. Since this local atmosphere is the key component to projects like Angkor Tourist City, the local officials continue to discuss how to successfully incorporate future tourism without sacrificing local values and culture.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1973, Atari began work on a driving game, an idea founder Nolan Bushnell had wanted to do since the company was {{initially}} founded in June 1972 before it was shelved in favor of Pong. The design work itself was handled by Cyan Engineering, which had recently become a semi-independent research and development subsidiary of Atari and had previously handled the prototype design of Gotcha. Larry Emmons developed the circuits to control the car itself in the game, creating the feel of braking, acceleration, and movement. Emmons also used integrated circuit-based memory—specifically, mask ROM (read-only memory)— in his circuit design to store graphical data such as the tracks, rather than the diode arrays <b>that</b> <b>previous</b> arcade games used. This {{is believed to be}} the first use of integrated circuit-based memory in an arcade game, and ROMs thereafter became the standard for arcade and console video games. The mechanical designs for the game, including the steering wheel, pedal, and gear shift controllers, were developed by Eigen Systems, located in the same building as Cyan and founded by ex-coworkers of the Cyan founders Emmons and Steven Mayer. At one point, the game's design included a small printer that would print high scores when achieved, but this was removed prior to the final design.|$|E
