Branam, PhD (Member) date AFIT/GAE/ENY/ 10 -D 02 The {{research}} {{presented here}} represents the first efforts to operate and quantify {{the performance of}} a three-axis Hall effect thruster.

Operating procedures for the thruster were developed and thrust and current density measurements were performed and compared with the baseline BHT- 200. The three-axis thruster was successfully operated in single, double and triple face configurations. Distinct jet plume and ball plume modes were observed. Inverted pendulum thrust stand readings in the single face mode indicated that the three-axis thruster produced considerably lower thrust, specific impulse and <b>thrust</b> <b>efficiencies</b> than the BHT- 200.

This paper makes an assessment of modified T 5 and T 6 hollow cathodes for use as millinewton range thrusters. The influence of terminal parameters such as discharge current, mass flow rate, and cathode/anode geometry on thrust production is discussed. The data indicate that the T 5 cathode {{may be able to}} develop specific impulses in the range of 150 – 250 s with argon at reasonable <b>thrust</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of up to 14 %. As such, hollow-cathode thrusters may meet some limited applications.

50|$|Disc {{loading of}} a {{hovering}} helicopter is {{the ratio of}} its weight to thetotal main rotor disc area. It is determined by dividingthe total helicopter weight by the rotor disc area,which is the area swept by the blades of a rotor. Discarea can be found by using the span of one rotor bladeas the radius of a circle and then determining the areathe blades encompass during a complete rotation. When a helicopter is being maneuvered, its disc loading changes.The higher the loading, the more power needed tomaintain rotor speed. A low disc loading is a direct indicator of high lift <b>thrust</b> <b>efficiency.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{expanding}} nozzle addresses this to {{a degree}} by including two skirts on a single engine, one inside the other. The first skirt, attached directly to the combustion chamber, is designed for use at lower altitudes and is short and squat. The second, sitting outside the first, fits over the lower altitude bell to extend it into a longer and narrower (measured in terms of length) bell used for higher altitudes. At liftoff the outer bell is pulled up from the inner bell, {{out of the way}} of the exhaust. As the spacecraft climbs, the outer bell is pushed back down over the inner bell to increase the <b>thrust</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Thus an expanding nozzle can have two sweet spots, which can lead to a major improvement in overall performance.|$|E
50|$|The {{observed}} {{thrust of}} experimental results {{has been argued}} to exceed the maximum efficiency of a perfectly collimated photon rocket, comprised between 3.33 and 6.67 µN/kW. However, the paper follows on White's idea of a degradable quantum vacuum for effective pair production, and Lewis's original concept of the photon {{which would be the}} conserved entity of nature, not its carried energy: The authors argue that the environment modifies photon energy and that pairing of photons within the electromagnetic energy density gradient of a resonant cavity would cause a shift down in energy, and the loss of electromagnetic potential becomes available for thrust, so according to the authors the level of energy of the paired photon when it escapes the cavity and the associated <b>thrust</b> <b>efficiency</b> remain an open question. The authors also argue that the cavity walls become transparent for the photon pair when it forms; as it has no associated electromagnetic field, it escapes the cavity to sparser surroundings.|$|E
40|$|The {{technique}} of feeding a solid propellant into the {{discharge from the}} sides of the discharge was evaluated.

Increasing the integral simultaneously increases both the gas dynamic and electromagnetic thrust. An analytic expression was formulated for ablated mass which comprehensively describes experimental data in terms of geometry and electrical parameters. The correlation of the product impulse x specific impulse with discharge energy was also described.

50|$|This type of {{thruster}} can accelerate a {{large number}} of different liquid metals or alloys. The best performance (in terms of <b>thrust</b> <b>efficiency</b> and power-to-thrust ratio) can be obtained using high atomic weight alkali metals, such as cesium and rubidium (133 amu for Cs, 85.5 amu for Rb). These propellants have a low ionization potential (3.87 eV for Cs and 4.16 eV for Rb), low melting point (28.7 °C for Cs and 38.9 °C for Rb) and very good wetting capabilities. These features lead to low power losses due to ionization and heating and the capability to use capillary forces for feeding purposes (i.e. no pressurised tanks nor valves are required). Moreover, alkali metals have the lowest attitude to form ionized droplets or multiply-charged ions, thus leading to the best attainable mass efficiency. The actual thrust is produced by exhausting a beam of mainly singly-ionized cesium or rubidium atoms, produced by field evaporation {{at the tip of the}} emitter.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of electro-osmosis or electroosmotic flow creates {{a flow of}} an electrolyte through a very small tube in the nano-meter range. To achieve this flow there is a cathode and an anode {{at the ends of}} the tube over which a voltage is applied. Due to this voltage the ions in the electrolyte stored in a reservoir directly connected to the tube can be accelerated and ejected. This way electrical energy is transformed into kinetic energy. The amount of thrust created by one nano thruster is in the micro newton range, however due to its size it makes sense to arrange a big amount in an array to achieve sufficient thrust. The thrust, exit velocity of the ions and the mass flow rate of the electrolyte are influenced by the applied voltage which makes it easy to regulate those parameters. The applied voltage and the pH-value of the electrolyte (amount of ions it contains) also vary the balance between <b>thrust,</b> <b>efficiency</b> and maximal exhaust velocity (determines the maximal achievable flight velocity). It is also theoretically possible to achieve a very high efficiency of nearly 100% as well as a high specific impulse and high thrust-to-power ratio. This system has not yet been build and experimentally tested because of difficulties with the production of the nano-tubes needed for it.|$|E
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} semi-empirical {{model of}} pulsed inductive <b>thrust</b> <b>efficiency</b> is developed {{to predict the}} effect of such a geometry on <b>thrust</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The model includes electromagnetic and gas-dynamic forces but excludes energy conversion from radial motion to axial motion, {{with the intention of}} characterizing <b>thrust</b> <b>efficiency</b> loss mechanisms that result from a conical versus a at inductive coil geometry. The range of conical pulsed inductive thruster geometries to which this model can be applied is explored with the use of finite element analysis. A semi-empirical relation for inductance as a function of current sheet radial and axial position is the limiting feature of the model, restricting the applicability as a function of half cone angle to a range from ten degrees to about 60 degrees. The model is nondimensionalized, yielding a set of dimensionless performance scaling parameters. Results of the model indicate that radial current sheet motion changes the axial dynamic impedance parameter at which <b>thrust</b> <b>efficiency</b> is maximized. This shift indicates that when radial current sheet motion is permitted in the model longer characteristic circuit timescales are more efficient, which can be attributed to a lower current sheet axial velocity as the plasma more rapidly decouples from the coil through radial motion. <b>Thrust</b> <b>efficiency</b> is shown to increase monotonically for decreasing values of the radial dynamic impedance parameter. This trend indicates that to maximize the radial decoupling timescale should be long compared to the characteristic circuit timescale...|$|E

Moreover, the experimental data of an oscillating wing propulsion ship were compared with the optimum motions calculated by the model. The results may be used for improvement of the oscillating wing system. The results were as follows. (1) Concerning the thrust force and its efficiency, the virtual mass term is more dominant at relatively lower dimensionless velocity. On the other hand, the lift component is superior at higher dimensionless velocity.
