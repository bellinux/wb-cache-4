5000|$|... == Overview == The various Naga tribes {{have their}} own cooking varieties, but they often {{exchange}} recipes. A typical Naga meal consists of a meat dish, a boiled vegetable dish or two, rice and a chutney (Tathu). Nagas tend to prefer boiled edible organic leaves. Some common dishes are [...] "fermented bamboo shoot" [...] (made from the tender shoot of the Bamboo tree) with fish and pork. axone(soyabean boiled, fermented and either smoked or sun dried) with smoked pork and beef. Smoked meat is produced by keeping the meat above the fire or {{hanging on the wall}} of the kitchen for anywhere between 1 day to 2 weeks or longer, which could last for the whole year ahead. Anishiis fermented taro leaves made into patties and smoked over the fire or sun dried [...] Naga food tends to be spicy(chillies). There are different varieties of chillies in Nagaland. The ginger used in the Naga cuisine is spicy, aromatic and is different from the common ginger. <b>The</b> <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> ginger leaves are also used in cooking with meat.

50|$|For 700 g of fish, finely chop {{an onion}} and saute it with oil, parsley, and two whole cloves of garlic. The moment the onion starts to brown, add 300 g of chopped from {{tomatoes}} or tomato paste, {{and season with}} salt and pepper. When the tomatoes are cooked, pour in one finger of strong vinegar or two fingers of weak vinegar, diluted in a large glass of water. Let boil for a few more minutes, then discard <b>the</b> <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> strain the rest of the ingredients, pressing hard against the mesh. Put the strained sauce back on the fire along with whatever fish you may have on hand, including sole, red mullet, gurnard, dogfish, mantis shrimp, and other types of fish in season, leaving the small fish whole and cutting the big ones into small pieces. Taste for seasoning; but in any case it is not a bad idea to add a little olive oil, since the amount of soffritto was quite small. When the fish is cooked, the cacciucco is usually brought to the table on two separate platters: on one you place the fish, strained from the broth, and on the other you arrange enough finger-thick slices of bread to soak up all the broth.|$|E

The study investigated the addition of mixtures of <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> ginger to diets of pullet chicks, growers and laying hens to evaluate beneficial effects on growth and egg production as well as their possible effects on lipid content of serum and yolk. Five diets were used for the study. Control diet was not supplemented with any of the mixtures. Four increasing levels of garlic (0. 5 %, 1. 0 %, 1. 5 % and 2. 0 %) were incorporated into diets for pullet chicks, growers and laying hens. Ginger supplements were also added to the diets at 0. 5 % and 0. 75 %. The results showed that <b>the</b> mixtures of <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> ginger were beneficial by promoting final live weight of pullet growers, laying hens and also by lowering total cholesterol, triacylglycerol concentration in serum and yolk. Furthermore, <b>the</b> mixtures of <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> ginger significantly (p< 0. 001) improved hen day production, egg weight and feed conversion. However, dietary inclusion of the mixtures significantly reduced shell weight and thickness.
