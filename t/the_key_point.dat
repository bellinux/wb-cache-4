5|$|At 05:45, Lieutenant-Colonel Mehmet Sefik of the Turkish 27th Infantry Regiment {{received}} {{orders to}} move his 1st and 3rd Battalions {{to the west and}} support the 2nd Battalion around Gaba Tepe. The two battalions were already assembled, having spent that night carrying out military exercises. They could not be sent to Ari Burnu as it was not marked on the Turkish maps. Colonel Halil Sami, commanding the 9th Division, also ordered the division's machine-gun company and an artillery battery to move in support of the 27th Infantry Regiment, followed soon after by an 77mm artillery battery. At 08:00 Lieutenant-Colonel Mustafa Kemal, commanding the 19th Division, was ordered to send a battalion to support them. Kemal instead decided to go himself with the 57th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battery towards Chunuk Bair, which he realised was <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>point</b> in the defence; whoever held those heights would dominate the battlefield. By chance, the 57th Infantry were supposed to have been on an exercise that morning around Hill 971 and had been prepared since 05:30, waiting for orders.|$|E
25|$|There exist {{alternative}} physical pictures {{which give}} the Hawking radiation {{in which the}} trans-Planckian problem is addressed. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>point</b> is that similar trans-Planckian problems occur when the modes occupied with Unruh radiation are traced back in time.

25|$|As for Hermitian matrices, <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>point</b> is {{to prove}} the {{existence}} {{of at least one}} nonzero eigenvector. To prove this, we cannot rely on determinants to show existence of eigenvalues, but instead one can use a maximization argument analogous to the variational characterization of eigenvalues. The above spectral theorem holds for real or complex Hilbert spaces.|$|E

25|$|In this example, <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>point</b> is {{that the}} kinetic energy is {{quadratic}} in the velocity. The equipartition theorem shows that in thermal equilibrium, any degree of freedom (such {{as a component of}} the position or velocity of a particle) which appears only quadratically in the energy has an average energy of kBT and therefore contributes kB to the system's heat capacity. This has many applications.|$|E

25|$|Wrist-related {{tenodesis}} effect (Tenodesis grasp) {{means that}} wrist flexion passively opens {{the hand and}} wrist extension passively closes the hand. (see pictures below) Wrist-related tenodesis effect is <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>point</b> of any functional surgery in a paralyzed hand, therefore active wrist extension is required and reconstruction of this active wrist extension is of utmost importance for the tetraplegic hand. If no active wrist extension is available (IC group 0 and 1), the brachioradialis (only IC group 1) can be transferred to achieve wrist extension.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1960s, much of {{the forest}} {{remained}} intact due to the restrictions in access to the Amazon aside from partial clearing along the river banks. The poor soil also made plantation-based agriculture unprofitable. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>point</b> in deforestation of the Amazon was when the colonists established farms within the forest during the 1960s. Their farming system was based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method. The colonists were unable to successfully manage their fields and the crops due {{to the loss of}} soil fertility and weed invasion.|$|E
25|$|For example, if E is a vector bundle over X, {{then there}} is a bundle E* over X, called the dual bundle, whose fiber at x ∈ X is the dual vector space (Ex)*. Formally E* can be defined as the set of pairs (x, φ), where x ∈ X and φ ∈ (E'x)*. The dual bundle is locally trivial because the dual space of the inverse of a local trivialization of E is a local trivialization of E*: <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>point</b> here is that the {{operation}} of taking the dual vector space is functorial.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} of transport for importers supports the alternating-access model. The resting state of importers is inward-facing, where the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) dimer interface is held open by the TMDs and facing outward but occluded from the cytoplasm. Upon docking of the closed, substrate-loaded binding protein towards the periplasmic {{side of the}} transmembrane domains, ATP binds and the NBD dimer closes. This switches the resting state of transporter into an outward-facing conformation, in which the TMDs have reoriented to receive substrate from the binding protein. After hydrolysis of ATP, the NBD dimer opens and substrate is released into the cytoplasm. Release of ADP and Pi reverts the transporter into its resting state. The only inconsistency of this mechanism to the ATP-switch model is that the conformation in its resting, nucleotide-free state {{is different from the}} expected outward-facing conformation. Although that is the case, <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>point</b> is that the NBD does not dimerize unless ATP and binding protein is bound to the transporter.|$|E
25|$|Dallas scored {{first on}} a 14-play, 88-yard drive in which Troy Aikman {{completed}} four passes to Michael Irvin for 65 yards {{and finished the}} drive with a 2-yard touchdown run. Perhaps <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>point</b> of the game occurred on the next series when Minnesota running back Amp Lee caught a short pass from quarterback Brad Johnson {{and appeared to be}} on his way for a 43-yard touchdown. But Cowboys safety George Teague caught up with Lee at the 1-yard line and poked the ball out of his hands, knocking it out of the end zone for a touchback. Dallas then drove 70 yards, including a 22-yard carry by Herschel Walker, to go up 10-0 on Chris Boniol's 28-yard field goal. Five plays after the ensuing kickoff, Teague stripped the ball from Vikings running back Leroy Hoard. Defensive back Deion Sanders recovered the fumble and lateraled it to Shante Carver, who was tackled on the Minnesota 37, and Emmitt Smith took off for a 37-yard touchdown run on the next play. Then during Minnesota's next possession, Teague intercepted a pass from Johnson and returned it 29 yards for a touchdown, giving the Cowboys a 24-0 lead with 8:36 left in the second quarter.|$|E
25|$|The {{pension benefit}} is not {{insignificant}} {{because it is}} estimated to cost 25% of salary over the entire 25-year period to fund a pension benefit of half the salary at age 55 for someone who starts employment at age 30. While this estimate {{is based on a}} 5% interest rate for discounting present values, a 3.5% annual salary growth rate and mortality according to the Annuity 2000 Merged Gender Mod 1 Table with ages set back 2.0 years. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>point</b> to use the same assumptions to compare the annual yearly cost as a percent of salary for a half pay pension for someone starting at age 30 and retiring at age 62. The additional seven-year wait would drive the cost down to under 17% of salary annual cost. In essence, the MTA's proposal was a greater than 8% salary cut across the board. Using a slightly worse mortality table, the effective salary cut is still within the 7% to 6% salary cut range in terms of value given up. By not accepting the MTA pension offer, Local 100 of the TWU was not forced to a cut. Citing the rising cost of health care, the MTA wanted new employees to contribute 1% of their salary to pay for health insurance. Transit workers currently do not pay for health insurance.|$|E
