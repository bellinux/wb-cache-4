Using vibration monitoring, it can be observed that each tap change operation generates a signal that contains information about the condition of the tap changer contacts and the drive mechanisms.

LTCs and voltage regulators refer to transformers with variable turns ratios that are placed at strategic points in a network and adjusted to raise or lower voltage as is necessary. Capacitor banks manage voltage by “generating” reactive power, and have thus far been the primary tools through which true Volt/VAR control is carried out. These large capacitors {{are connected to the}} grid in shunt configuration through switches which, when closed, allow the capacitors to generate VARs and boost voltage at the point of connection. In the future, further VVC might be carried out by smart inverters and other distributed generation resources, which can also inject reactive power into a distribution network. A VVC application helps the operator mitigate dangerously low or high voltage conditions by suggesting required action plans for all VVC equipment. The plan will give a required <b>tap</b> <b>position</b> and capacitor switching state to ensure the voltage stays close to its nominal value and thus optimize Volt-VAR control function for the utility.|$|E

It has been a custom for decades to provide a separate panel for {{on load tap changer}} control for monitoring the <b>tap</b> <b>position.</b> However, this facility cannot either record or transfer the information to remote control centers. As there is a technology shift towards the smart grid protection and control standards, the need for implementing remote control and monitoring has necessitated the implementation of this feature in numerical relays. This paper deals with the programming, settings and logic implementation which is applicable to both IEC 61850 compatible and non-compatible IEDs thereby eliminating the need for separate tap changer control equipment.

This approach solves the convergence problem caused by voltage violations at AC buses during the power flow calculation for the DC subsystems. The convergence property can be significantly improved {{by adjusting the}} converter transformer <b>tap</b> <b>position</b> flexibly. In order to adjust the <b>tap</b> <b>position</b> of the converter transformer flexibly, three mainly modifications are proposed. Firstly, the equations for whole DC systems are decoupled into individual DC systems so as to easily figure out which DC system's <b>tap</b> <b>position</b> needs adjustment. Secondly, the tap ratio of a converter transformer is selected as an alternative state variable to replace the cosine of the control angle when necessary. Thirdly, the Newton-Raphson method is utilized to solve DC subsystems instead of the method using the linear equations. Furthermore, a theoretical analysis {{of the advantages of}} the proposed approach is also presented. Numerical simulations and practical applications show that the proposed approach meet the requirement of different system operating conditions and has advantages in terms of convergence and speed.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} mainly {{focused on the}} {{development}} of (i) phase shifting transformers (PSTs) mathematical and simulation models {{that can be used for}} the short-circuit and protection studies, and (ii) new phase shifting transformers protection methods that provide more secure and sensitive solutions than the standard current differential protection. The first part of this thesis describes and presents the modeling of the single-core standard-delta, and two-core symmetrical and asymmetrical PST for protection and short-circuit studies. The models already available for such types of PSTs have limitations and require detailed test report data from the manufacturers. However, winding test data at each <b>tap</b> <b>position</b> is seldom available from the manufacturers. Moreover, they are confined to the balanced system conditions. The proposed modeling approach is based {{on the development of}} positive, negative and zero-sequence networks. Derived mathematical relations are further used to develop the relations of winding terminal voltages, currents and impedances as a function of <b>tap</b> <b>position.</b> Accuracy of the presented models is verified mathematically with the manufacturer’s test report data. Furthermore, electromagnetic transients program (EMTP) modeling, in commercially available simulation tools such as PSCAD/EMTDC and RTDS, is done in order to further verify the proposed models. The proposed modeling approach does not rely on the availability of the manufacturer test report data and only requires the nameplate information. It can also be used for both balanced and unbalanced system conditions. The second part of the thesis presents two protection principles: (a) electromagnetic differential protection, and (b) directional comparison-based protection. The main motive behind the development of new protection principles is to develop a solution that is more secure, sensitive and offers high-speed protection. Correct implementation of these techniques for the protection of various kinds of PSTs comes across various problems and hence leads us to the proposed solution of those issues. Both techniques solve the problems of conventional challenges such as magnetizing inrush current, core saturation, non-standard phase shift, external fault with current transformer (CT) saturation, etc. The electromagnetic differential protection principle can only be applied to the PST it represents and it requires <b>tap</b> <b>position</b> tracking. A directional comparison-based approach can be applied to any kind of PST without tracking the <b>tap</b> <b>position...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} an optimal {{selection}} of <b>tap</b> <b>positions</b> for certain LFSR-based encryption schemes is investigated from both design and cryptanalytic perspective. Two novel algorithms towards an optimal selection of <b>tap</b> <b>positions</b> are given {{which can be}} satisfactorily used to provide (sub) optimal resistance to some generic cryptanalytic techniques applicable to these schemes. It is demonstrated that certain real-life ciphers (e. g. SOBER-t 32, SFINKS and Grain- 128), employing some standard criteria for tap selection such as the concept of full difference set, are not fully optimized with respect to these attacks. These standard design criteria are quite insufficient and the proposed algorithms {{appear to be the}} only generic method for the purpose of (sub) optimal selection of <b>tap</b> <b>positions.</b> We also extend the framework of a generic cryptanalytic method called Generalized Filter State Guessing Attacks (GFSGA), introduced in [26] as a generalization of the FSGA method, by applying a variable sampling of the keystream bits in order to retrieve as much information about the secret state bits as possible. Two different modes that use a variable sampling of keystream blocks are presented and it is shown that in many cases these modes may outperform the standard GFSGA mode. We also demonstrate the possibility of employing GFSGA-like attacks to other design strategies such as NFSR-based ciphers (Grain family for instance) and filter generators outputting a single bit each time the cipher is clocked. In particular, when the latter scenario is considered, the idea of combining GFSGA technique and algebraic attacks appears to be a promising unified cryptanalytic method against NFSR-based stream ciphers.

The terminal equivalent modeling makes use of additional common-mode measurements to avoid error magnifications to result from the ungrounded tertiary winding.

In these areas, step-voltage-regulators (SVRs) with an open-delta configuration {{are widely used}} for voltage regulation. However, since SVRs were initially designed for tackling slow and smooth load variations, frequent PV output fluctuations can cause excessive tap changes. Moreover, rural communication facilities are normally expensive and under-developed, so only limited parameters are recorded with low resolution and reliability. Thus, much needed tap information cannot be properly monitored in a cost-effective way. In contrast, a downstream load center or utility-scale PV site is commonly well equipped with modern sensors and data acquisition systems, which provide the possibility for tap evaluation.
