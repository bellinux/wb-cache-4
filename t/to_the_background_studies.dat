40|$|While the bunches in {{a linear}} {{collider}} cross once only, {{due to their}} small size they experience a strong beam-beam effect. Guinea-Pig is a code to simulate {{the impact of this}} effect on luminosity and background. A short overview of the program is given, with examples of its application <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> <b>studies</b> for TESLA, the top threshold scan and a possible luminosity monitor; as well as some results for CLIC. 1 INTRODUCTION In future high energy linear colliders the beams have to be focused to very small sizes in order to achieve the required luminosity. The electro-magnetic field of each bunch will then have a strong effect on the other. In electron positron collisions the resulting forces focus the two beams, leading to an enhancement of the luminosity. Due to the strong bending of their trajectories the beam particles will emit high energy photons, the so-called beamstrahlung. This significantly changes the luminosity spectrum and can lead to an increase in the background. Ele [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The DOE {{developed}} ''Technology Evolution Rationale'' {{documents for}} many of its technology development programs, at this time (report is dated October 1, 1990). This is a very significant description {{of the status of}} resources, technology, and industry in 1990, and the thinking that guided the DOE Geothermal Research Program at this time. The report describes: Geothermal energy conversion and use technologies, Resources and land use, Stakeholder and users, Industry status, and Market acceptance and experience in the U. S. The Economic status chapter covers Figures of Merit for assessing geothermal energy systems, and trends in geothermal development. The chapter on Cost/performance projections provides much detail on estimates of system costs, and projections for how DOE R&D would likely affect those costs. The Rationale chapter provides much detail on how subsystems are linked together to provide system performance and cost estimates, and details of technology improvements being worked on that are likely to reduce the cost of power from geothermal.

40|$|Camouflage {{is found}} {{in a wide range}} of species living in {{numerous}} habitat types, offering protection from visually guided predators. This includes many species from the intertidal zone, which must cope with background types diverse in appearance and with multiple predator groups foraging at high and low tide. Many animals are capable of either relatively slow (hours, days, weeks) or rapid (seconds and minutes) colour change in order <b>to</b> better resemble <b>the</b> <b>background</b> against which they are found, but most work has been restricted to a few species or taxa. It is often suggested that many small intertidal fish are capable of colour change for camouflage, yet little experimental work has addressed this. Here, we test rock gobies (Gobius paganellus) for colour change abilities, and whether they can tune their appearance <b>to</b> match <b>the</b> <b>background.</b> In two experiments, we place gobies on backgrounds of different brightness (black or white), and of different colours (red and blue) and use digital image analysis and modelling of predator (avian) vision to quantify colour and luminance (perceived lightness) changes and camouflage. We find that gobies are capable of rapid colour change (occurring within one minute), and that they can change their luminance on lighter or darker backgrounds. When presented on backgrounds of different colours, gobies also change their colour (hue and saturation) while keeping luminance the same. These changes lead to predicted improvements in camouflage match <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>background.</b> Our <b>study</b> shows that small rockpool fish are capable of rapid visual change for concealment, and that this may be an important mechanism in many species to avoid predation, especially in complex heterogeneous environments...|$|R
40|$|Escherichia coli {{uses the}} DsbA/DsbB system for {{introducing}} disulphide bonds into proteins {{in the cell}} envelope. Deleting either dsbA or dsbB or both reduces disulphide bond formation but does not entirely eliminate it. Whether such background disulphide bond forming activity is enzyme-catalysed is not known. To identify possible cellular factors that might contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> activity, we <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> effects of overexpressing endogenous proteins on disulphide bond formation in the periplasm. We find that overexpressing PspE, a periplasmic rhodanese, partially restores substantial disulphide bond formation to a dsbA strain. This activity depends on DsbC, the bacterial disulphide bond isomerase, but not on DsbB. We show that overexpressed PspE is oxidized <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sulphenic acid form and reacts with substrate proteins to form mixed disulphide adducts. DsbC either prevents the formation of these mixed disulphides or resolves these adducts subsequently. In the process, DsbC itself gets oxidized and proceeds to catalyse disulphide bond formation.

40|$|Abstract <b>Background</b> <b>The</b> {{prevention}} of overweight and obesity during infancy {{is a highly}} relevant public health topic given the significant impact of childhood obesity on acute and chronic diseases, general health, and well-being in later stages of life. Apart from the family setting, daycare facilities (DFs) represent a key setting for health promotion among {{children under the age}} of six years. “JolinchenKids – Fit and Healthy in Daycare” is a multi-component program promoting physical activity (PA), healthy eating, and mental well-being in 3 - to 6 -year-old preschoolers at DFs, originally designed by the German health insurance AOK. To evaluate program effectiveness, a cluster-controlled trial involving 68 DFs is currently conducted. The objective of this article is <b>to</b> describe <b>the</b> <b>background,</b> <b>study</b> design, and aims of this trial. Methods/design Sixty-eight DFs across Germany will be recruited to take part in the study, half of them serving as intervention DFs and half of them as delayed intervention control DFs (which receive the program upon completion of the study). At each DF, height, weight, and body composition, as well as motor skills, will be assessed in twenty 3 - to 6 -year-old children. Children’s eating and PA habits, and mental well-being will be assessed via parental questionnaires. A subsample of children (i. e., at 24 DFs which are randomly selected within a geographic region) will be asked to wear accelerometers at their wrists to objectively measure PA over the course of seven days. To compare changes in body composition, motor skills, eating and PA habits, and mental well-being of children at intervention DFs with those observed among children at delayed intervention control DFs over one year, all measurements will take place at baseline and twelve months after the launch of the program at all DFs. Discussion This study investigates the influence of a health promotion program in the daycare setting on various outcomes, including body composition and objectively measured PA, in a nationwide sample of 3 - to 6 -year-old preschoolers. This study will provide evidence regarding the effectiveness of a multi-component program for health promotion in this setting and may provide insights into new strategies for preventing obesity in early life.

It especially reveals the tensions arising between art deco (i. e. architectural) preservation and gay (i. e. social) urban preservation, {{as well as its}} under-studied largely entrepreneurial nature and attraction for a mainstream, cosmopolitan class under neoliberalism. Drawing from extensive archival, policy, observational, participatory and interview data over 2013 – 2015, the article revisits in historical perspective how the art deco area, incarnated in the 1920 s, developed across class-, ethnicity-, religion- and age-inflected social fragmentations and how this legacy, from the late- 1970 s onward, segued into the local gay-led preservation movement and select commemorations of the art deco scene. <b>To</b> this <b>background,</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> employs the tenet of ‘queerying’ <b>to</b> address <b>the</b> under-researched coalescing frictions in preservation between perceived authentic and engineered trajectories of (gay) place (re) makings alongside reminiscences selected over others.

Similarly, the following challenges were picked up: Firstly, lack of access to hardware and software, no immediate repairs of computers, no obligation from the Department of Education to integrate computers into mathematics lessons and poor time-tabling of computer lessons. Secondly, lack of mathematics technology knowledge may result in teachers not perceiving the usefulness of the technology. Lastly, lack of in-depth professional development in technology integration negatively impacts on teachers’ practices such as expertise in planning, classroom technology management and classroom instruction. In serving its purpose, the study has provided an understanding that computers hold potential opportunities when integrated into mathematics classrooms. However, there are challenges teachers may face pertaining to this integration scenario...|$|R

When a person experiences a conflict at work what do these experiences involve and how do they affect the well-being of the person involved and the picture he or she has of him or herself? How does a workplace conflict develop over time and how can we understand its origin and course? How do individuals experience the way a conflict is handled in a workplace in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> structure of the organisation and leadership? The study is based on a qualitative interview method with three individuals who have experienced workplace conflict. Through our study we endeavoured to find an in-depth understanding conveyed through the life world perspective of the interviewees, which is our empirical data. The analysis is related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>study’s</b> <b>background</b> of earlier research and theory within the field of workplace conflict. On the basis of our study can we illustrate that in order to prevent and handle workplace conflict, clear communication and individual resources are required; these include: a reflexive ability to work out issues independently. Acknowledgement is a mechanism that is central to this process in order for an individual to develop an understanding of him or herself and the situation that has arisen because of the conflict, and for him or her to be able to act...|$|R

Indonesia is a big country which have various tribes, cultures, and religions. Its complexity is showed by the coming of new ethnics to Indonesia. In accordance with the development and the growth of this country, one of the ethnic is Arabic. The growth number of Arabic in Indonesia is increase years to years, it shows that a lot of Arabic are getting married and having children. Biologically, they can continue the descent of the family. As one of ethnics which have special cultures and worthy norms, they have a sight about children.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{understanding}} of the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism in the ATLAS experiment at LHC collider, by studying two complementary thematics : the search for the Higgs boson in the H->gamma gamma channel, and a search for extra dimensions in the gluon sector. Tests of the electronic of the electromagnetic calorimeter allowed to validate various cards that were under the responsibility of the LPNHE. Using full simulation data of the detector allowed us to precisely compute mass resolution of the diphoton system. Due to recent theoretical improvements, signal and <b>background</b> have been <b>studied</b> at the next order of the perturbative development, which increases cross-sections. With regards <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jet <b>background,</b> a <b>study</b> has been done using discriminating variables in order to obtain, for a 80 % photons efficiency, a rejection factor of 7000. The discovery potential benefits from this change of cross-sections and increases by 52 % in comparison with the same analysis done at the leading order. In addition to this, a new analysis using a maximum likelihood method allowed us to increase by 40 % the discovery potential in comparison with our classical analysis. In conclusion, the Higgs boson of 120 GeV/c^ 2 can be now discovered in this channel with an integrated luminosity of 10 fb^{- 1 }. Furthermore, naturality problem of the Higgs boson mass can be solved by introducing extra dimensions in which gluons can propagate. We have shown {{that it was possible to}} discover extra-dimensions up to a compactication scale of 15 TeV. key words : Higgs, Photon, Extra-Dimensions, Kaluza-Klein, gluon, LHC, ATLAS, Electromagnetic Calorimeter, Liquid Argon, Electronics...|$|R
40|$|Bioaccumulation of As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn by Macrobrachium prawns was {{observed}} <b>to</b> occur in <b>the</b> Strickland River downstream of {{a gold mine}} at Porgera, Papua New Guinea. This was despite the total metal concentrations of waters and sediments indicating no difference from reference sites within tributaries. To provide information on potential sources and bioavailability of metals to prawns, an extensive range of analyses were made on waters, suspended solids, deposited sediments and plant materials within the river system. Dissolved metal concentrations were mostly sub-micrograms per liter and no major differences existed in concentrations or speciation between sites within the Strickland River or its tributaries. Similarly, no differences were detected between sites for total or dilute acid-extractable metal concentrations in bed sediments and plant materials, which may be ingested by the prawns. However, the rivers in this region are highly turbid and the dilute acid-extractable cadmium and zinc concentrations in suspended solids were greater at sites in the Strickland River than at sites in tributaries. The results indicated that mine-derived inputs increased the proportion of these forms of metals or metalloids in the Strickland River. These less strongly bound metals and metalloids would be more bioavailable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prawns via the dietary pathway. The results highlighted many of the difficulties in using routine monitoring data without information on metal speciation to describe metal uptake and predict potential effects when concentrations are low and similar <b>to</b> <b>background.</b> <b>The</b> <b>study</b> indicated that the monitoring of contaminant concentrations in organisms that integrate the exposure from multiple exposure routes and durations may often be more effective for detecting impacts than intermittent monitoring of contaminants in waters and sediments. © 2014, Springer...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, {{disabled}} {{children have been}} hidden from the lenses of research in both the social model of disability and the new sociology of childhood. In an attempt to give a voice to children with disability who are often objectified and silenced, this study aimed at exploring the experiences and coping strategies of visually impaired young people in a mainstream school in Ghana. The study further tried to explore views of {{children and young people}} with disability themselves who have been pushed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>background.</b> This <b>study</b> mainly aimed to gain insight into the experiences of visually impaired children in order to highlight its implications in a specific context; a mainstream or regular Ghanaian school context. In order to undertake this research, methods used included semi-participant observation; neighbourhood walks/guided tours, semi-structured interviews, joint interviews/ discussions and informal dialogues/conversations. The research was conducted with six main visually impaired participants while two other informants were only observed. The study reveals that participants employed multiple perspectives of disability in nuanced ways and situations. These multiple disability perspectives include the medical model (disability as an illness, a defect); and disability as impairment (intellectual, physical and sensory impairments). Some participants employed the use of a local expression for persons with disability, thus revealing the social aspect of this view. Although alluding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> physical pain that accompanies their impairment (medical model), several participants emphasized that there were positive aspects to it such as sharpening of other senses. Most informants did not overtly subscribe <b>to</b> <b>the</b> notion that society ‗disables‘ them, yet latently implied this by noting that they faced some preventable challenges (with mobility and dependence) due to lack of societal consideration or provision (unfriendly terrain and Braille textbooks). Hence, participants did not seem <b>to</b> support <b>the</b> strict divide between the medical and social models. The visually impaired also saw their impairment cause as bio-medical but also spiritually caused by witches or as a punishment for familial actions. Thus bio-medical and spiritual (faith-healing) treatments were combined. However, the visually impaired revealed a change in perspective by revealing that they will seek bio-medical treatment primary to personal prayers to God since healing by God is done through medical practitioners. The experiences of the visually impaired was characterised by dependence, inter-dependence and collaboration. Most instances of dependence resulted from an interaction between the interaction and a lack of resource provision; however the visually impaired expressed their agency in dealing with such situations. Other coping strategies involved the use of humour, positive self-evaluation and their Christian faith. The study thus shows that educational and societal inclusion of persons with disabilities should consider the interaction between individual and societal barriers to functioning. </p...|$|R

The first place that forms their personality is home, aplace where they live, set affection, feeling, and aspiration. At home, they meetpeople who take roles in their development, and parents are the first that form it. The way the parents raise their children takes a big role in their childrendevelopment. Everything that they teach to their children will affect theirchildrens 2 ̆ 7 developments and lives. Related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> of <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> thisstudy aims to answer two following questions. The first, what kinds of parentingstyles are used by Ansiedad 2 ̆ 7 s parents? And the second, what are the effects of <b>the</b> parenting style <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attachment between Ansiedad and her parents?In this study, developmental psychology will be applied and only focusedon the adolescent developmental psychology. Then <b>to</b> analyze <b>the</b> data,theparenting style that is used by Ansiedad 2 ̆ 7 s mother will be explained by the writer. The attachments as the result of parenting styles will also be explained. Based on the result of the study, the writer found that neglectful parentingstyle is used by Ansiedad 2 ̆ 7 s parent. The effect of parenting style <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attachment between Ansiedad and her parents is insecure attachment. In this study, the writer found the kinds of insecure attachment, dismissing or avoidant attachment, resistant or ambivalent attachment, and unresolved or disorganized attachment. In conclusion, the way the parents raise their children is very important. Because, if the parents raised her children in a good way, it can make her children be a good children. On the other hand, if the parents raised her children with badly, it can make the children be bad children. This study is expected to be useful for English Department students. Moreover, the writer hopes the futureresearchers who are interested in developmental psychology, especially inparenting style, may use new complete references and different object of study...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} the scope of metonymy {{throughout}} history remains severely reduced to a process of word substitution and the signifying potential of the trope is limited <b>to</b> lexical representation. <b>The</b> study therefore proposes a semiotic approach <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> trope beyond this limitation {{and to develop a}} textual theory <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trope. A <b>background</b> <b>study</b> related to how metonymy is treated in previous studies is therefore necessary. This review of literature covers a long period starting from ancient Greece and going up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> present day. Chapters one and two of this thesis, which give this general <b>background,</b> show that <b>the</b> hypothesis is <b>to</b> a large extent valid. The thesis then examines another related hypothesis which is that metonymy is semiotic in nature and a semiotic approach to metonymy will solve the problem of reductionism in the treatment of this trope. Chapter three is devoted to an examination of this hypothesis. It shows that a semiotic approach to metonymy is not only possible but also crucial. <b>The</b> semiotic approach <b>to</b> metonymy basically concerns the treatment of metonymy as a sign which cuts across three domains of representation. These are the domain of words, the domain of concepts and the domain of things or objects. The last domain is itself treated from a semiotic perspective <b>to</b> stand for <b>the</b> domain of context at large. {{on the basis of this}} semiotic approach to metonymy a textual model of metonymic relations in text is constructed. this model is put <b>to</b> <b>the</b> test in chapter four. here the metonymic relations of form for form, form for concept, form for thing, thing for form and concept for form are brought <b>to</b> bear on <b>the</b> formal and semantic connectedness of text. in chapter five the metonymic relations of concept for concept, concept for thing, thing for thing and thing for concept are used to explain how these metonymic relations interact to provide a linkage between language, cognition and context...|$|R
40|$|The Large Hadron Collider is a two-ring, superconducting {{accelerator}} and collider {{which can}} provide both proton and heavy-ion beams. First collisions are foreseen for 2009. The Compact Muon System (CMS) detector will measure the particles {{created in the}} hadron collisions and can confirm the Standard Model by establishing {{the existence of the}} Higgs boson, but also search for new phenomena. In order to provide a robust and precise track reconstruction, which can already be used in the High-Level Trigger systems, the positions of the silicon sensors in the CMS tracker have to been known with an accuracy of O(100 µm). Therefore the CMS tracker has been equipped with a dedicated alignment system. The Laser Alignment System (LAS) aligns the tracker subdetectors with respect to each other and can also monitor the stability of the sensor positions during data taking. This study describes the implementation of a realistic simulation of the LAS in the CMS software framework (CMSSW) as well as the analysis of the first data collected during the integration of one of the tracker endcaps. In the present study it has been found that the alignment of the endcaps is possible with an accuracy of approximately 76 µm. These results are in agreement with independent measurements of the TEC geometry using cosmic muons or photogrammetry measurements. The accuracy of approximately 100 µm needed for track pattern recognition and reconstruction can be assured by the Laser Alignment System as shown in this study. Accurate knowledge of the luminosity delivered by <b>the</b> LHC <b>to</b> <b>the</b> experiments is an essential ingredient for many physics studies. The present work uses the production of lepton pairs via <b>the</b> Drell-Yan mechanism <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> integrated luminosity with the CMS detector. A Monte Carlo generator (MC@NLO) including next-to-leading order QCD diagrams has been used to generate Drell-Yan events decaying into two muons.
