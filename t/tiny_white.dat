5|$|The first {{poultry breed}} {{to have its}} own {{specialist}} club for enthusiasts, Sebrights were admitted to poultry exhibition standards not long after their establishment. Today, they are among the most popular of bantam breeds. Despite their popularity, Sebrights are often difficult to breed, and the inheritance of certain unique characteristics the breed carries has been studied scientifically. As a largely ornamental chicken, they lay <b>tiny,</b> <b>white</b> eggs and are not kept for meat production.|$|E

60|$|And then, being {{susceptible}} to the barbed arrows of beauty, I warmed to the adventure. The three of us hurried to the ferry, and there I found {{the price of a}} ticket to Greenburg to be but a dollar and eighty cents. I bought one, and a red, red rose with the twenty cents for Miss Lowery. We saw her aboard her ferryboat, and stood watching her wave her handkerchief at us until it was the <b>tiniest</b> <b>white</b> patch imaginable.

500|$|M.rotula is {{distinguished}} from M.bulliardii by its larger size, and {{greater number of}} gills. M.limosus is found in marshes, where it fruits on the dead stems of reeds and rushes. Tetrapyrgos nigripes (formerly treated in Marasmius) has white caps that are [...] in diameter, attached gills that are sometimes slightly decurrent, a dark stem covered with <b>tiny</b> <b>white</b> hairs that give it a powdered appearance, and triangular to star-shaped spores. M.neorotula, described from Brazil, was considered by its discoverer Rolf Singer to be closely related to M.rotula. In addition to its tropical distribution, it can distinguished from M.rotula by its smaller size and more widely spaced gills. M.rotuloides, known only from montane forests of Trinidad, can only be reliably distinguished from M.rotula by microscopic characteristics: it has smaller, ovoid spores measuring 5 by 2.5µm.|$|E
500|$|The cap is conical to bell-shaped, {{flattening}} in age, {{and reaches}} {{a diameter of}} [...] The cap margin is usually bent inwards initially. The cap surface is initially covered with <b>tiny</b> <b>white</b> hairs, but later becomes smooth. It is slightly hygrophanous, and when moist, is slightly translucent, so that {{the outline of the}} gills underneath are apparent. Its color is dark purple in the center, fading to pale lilac at the margins; older specimens are purplish-gray. [...] The flesh is thin and pliant, with a texture similar to cartilage. It is initially purplish-gray, becoming pale lilac to white in age. The odor and taste of the flesh are not distinctive. The narrow gills have an ascending attachment to the stipe and are narrowly adnate. They are somewhat closely spaced, with pallid to grayish face color and dark grayish purple edges that are sometimes fringed. The tubular stipe measures [...] long by 1–2mm thick. It is tough and cartilaginous, and its base it covered with white hairs. Overall, its color is that of the cap or paler, and often paler near the top. The edibility of the mushroom is unknown.|$|E
500|$|Panellus stipticus, {{commonly}} known as the bitter oyster, the astringent panus, the luminescent panellus, or the stiptic fungus, is a species of fungus in the family Mycenaceae, and the type species of the genus Panellus. A common and widely distributed species, it is found in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America, where it grows in groups or dense overlapping clusters on the logs, stumps, and trunks of deciduous trees, especially beech, oak, and birch. During the development of the fruit bodies, the mushrooms start out as <b>tiny</b> <b>white</b> knobs, which, over a period of one to three months, develop into fan- or kidney-shaped caps that measure up to [...] broad. The caps are orange-yellow to brownish, and attached to the decaying wood by short stubby stalks that are connected off-center or {{on the side of the}} caps. The fungus was given its current scientific name in 1879, but has been known by many names since French mycologist Jean Bulliard first described it as Agaricus stypticus in 1783. Molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed P.stipticus to have a close genetic relationship with members of the genus Mycena.|$|E

60|$|But as {{the time}} drew near, and nothing was heard of the princess, the youth became anxious and uneasy, {{especially}} {{when it came to}} his ears that the great cask was being filled with pitch, and that sticks were laid underneath to make a fire to boil it with. All day long the boy stood at the window, looking over the sea by which the princess must travel; but there were no signs of her, not even the <b>tiniest</b> <b>white</b> sail. And, as he stood, soldiers came and laid hands on him, and led him up to the cask, where a big fire was blazing, and the horrid black pitch boiling and bubbling over the sides. He looked and shuddered, but there was no escape; so he shut his eyes to avoid seeing.|$|R

It has a delicate fragrance similar to fresh flowers. The taste is not harsh and its sweet flavor has a moisturizing effect.|$|R
500|$|Fruit bodies first {{appear as}} <b>tiny</b> <b>white</b> knobs {{less than a}} cubic {{millimeter}} in size. In {{a day or two}} the knobs grow into a horizontal pyramidal mass, increasing in height as the hyphae lengthen. This is soon followed by the formation of a minute cap, and lengthening of the stem. The stem is about 1mm long when the cap first begins to form. The hyphae that comprise the stem gradually cease to grow at their ends, and then start to branch, with many of the branches growing in a horizontal direction. This growth, indicated by the flattening and broadening out of the top of the stem, gives rise to the cap. The horizontally aligned hyphae grow vertical branches which remain more or less parallel, ultimately forming the dorsal tissue of the cap. Other similar downward-growing branches form the fertile hymenium, which can be seen when the cap is about 2mm in diameter.The young cap is spherical and its growth is at first , its margin being curved inwards and pressed against the stem. In this way, the hymenium begins its development within a special enclosed chamber. As the hymenial surface increases and keeps pace with the growth of the dorsal tissue of the cap, the latter expands and exposes the gills. The gills are formed by the continual downward growth of some of the hyphae. The gills are exposed before the cap is completely developed, and before the spores are mature. Spores can be produced by fruit bodies as small as [...] broad, and liberation of the spores continues until the fruit body is fully grown—a period of one month to three months, depending on the conditions of temperature and moisture. The mature spores are disseminated by the wind. When the fruit body is nearing maturity, some of the terminal portions of the hyphae of the dorsal surface of the cap separate, and as a consequence, the upper surface of the fruit body becomes granular in appearance.|$|E
