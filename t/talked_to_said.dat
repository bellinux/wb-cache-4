500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Tony Phelan and Joan Rater, while filmmaker Julie Anne Robinson directed it. Featured music includes Psapp's [...] "King of You", The Whitest Boy Alive's [...] "Fireworks", Iain Archer's [...] "Canal Song", Miho Hatori's [...] "Barracuda" [...] and Sybarite's [...] "Runaway". Rater described that she got the idea after being told {{that her husband had}} to undergo a craniotomy. She noted that the plan for the episode was to focus on Ellis' inner feelings, mainly her fright, frustration and stress. [...] "The concept of someone with this disease having a lucid day is real. The disease varies for everyone, but experts we <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>said</b> that patients have bad days and good days and then sometimes they have great days where it seems like they are their old selves. Maybe it's a moment, maybe an hour, for some a whole afternoon, but we were fascinated with the idea of getting this time, this gift, and knowing that it's only temporary. What would you do with that one day? And what would it mean for Meredith?", stated Rater, explaining the premise of the episode. She also stated that [...] "the cool idea" [...] to have Meredith and Ellis connect again had been considered for almost a year before the actual concept of the episode was written, after numerous attempts to include the storyline in other episodes that [...] "didn't feel quite right": [...] "If you're going to give Meredith her mother back and then take her away again, you'd better have a pretty good reason." [...] Rater also explained that, in her vision, the episode introduces a new period in the interns' lives, focusing on their finding an identity as surgeons, becoming more central than {{in the beginning of the}} season, which revolved around the aftermath of Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)'s death and Meredith's involvement in the love triangle between her, Shepherd and Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell).|$|E
6000|$|Some of the French and Italian people I <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>said</b> {{they were}} {{fighting}} for [...] "Civilisation." [...] That is one name for the kingdom of God, and I have heard English people use it too. But much of the contemporary thought of England stills wanders with its back to the light. Most of it is pawing over jerry-built, secondary things. I have before me a little book, the joint work of Dr. Grey and Mr. Turner, of an ex-public schoolmaster and a manufacturer, called Eclipse or Empire? (The title World Might or Downfall? had already been secured in another quarter.) It is a book that has been enormously advertised; it has been almost impossible to escape its column-long advertisements; it is billed upon the hoardings, and {{it is on the}} whole a very able and right-spirited book. It calls for more and better education, for more scientific methods, for less class suspicion and more social explicitness and understanding, for a franker and fairer treatment of labour. But why does it call for these things? Does it call for them because they are right? Because in accomplishing them one serves God? ...|$|E
5000|$|On June 24, 2008 Ricciardi told Toronto {{media that}} he {{received}} a personal phone call from Dunn and personally apologized for the ad-lib comments, a conversation Dunn vehemently refuted {{in an interview with}} MLB.com. Some again questioned Ricciardi's trustworthiness, but Ricciardi said, [...] "All I know is the person I <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>said</b> it was Adam Dunn. That's quite a prank to pull." ...|$|E

5000|$|Weiner did not {{interview}} Edward Said. Asked about this, he {{said that}} after conducting research that lasted three years, he saw no need <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>Said</b> about his memories or his childhood: [...] "The evidence became so overwhelming. It {{was no longer an}} issue of discrepancies. It was a chasm. There was no point in calling him up and saying, 'You're a liar, you're a fraud.'" ...|$|R

40|$|The {{government}} {{says that all}} adults should {{have the opportunity to}} live active adult lives. Many people with learning disabilities need support from professionals to realise living active adult lives. We asked some professionals what active adult living means and they believed it is about self-determination and making healthy choices. Some of those we <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>said</b> it was necessary to have more time to support active adult living in people with learning disabilities...|$|E

6000|$|... "Only a few words. She {{came to my}} room {{last night}} and {{told me she had}} only a dim {{recollection}} of what took place. She said The Voices wanted <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me--but I didn't want them <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me--and <b>said</b> so--and she went away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Mr Lightwood,' <b>said</b> Lizzie, turning <b>to</b> {{him with}} a smile. 'But it cannot have been Society that {{disturbed}} you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Oh, I {{know you}} don’t want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me!” she <b>said.</b> “Still, though I feel most horribly mean, I {{did it because}} I had to.” ...|$|R
50|$|As a young intern at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, D.C., {{immediately}} after World War II, Kavka treated poet Ezra Pound. Pound was “vigorously and viciously anti-Semitic” and “quite crazy, but Jerry, who was Jewish, managed still <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him,” <b>said</b> colleague and student Arnold Goldberg of him later.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{policeman}} I <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> once <b>said</b> the same. Captain Fort {{says that}} very few men can stand having power put into their hands without being spoiled. He told me some dreadful stories. He says we have no imagination, so that we often do things without seeing how brutal they are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, Mr. Lincoln," [...] said my General, [...] "you {{may have}} Brice. Be careful he doesn't <b>talk</b> you <b>to</b> death--he's <b>said</b> too much already." ...|$|R
5000|$|John Madden {{served as}} Coryell's {{defensive}} assistant at SDSU. Madden had first met Coryell attending a coaching clinic on the I formation led by McKay. [...] "We'd {{go to these}} clinics, and afterward, everyone would run up <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> McKay", <b>said</b> Madden. [...] "Coryell was there because he introduced (McKay).

6000|$|... "'You needn't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me,' Jimmy <b>said</b> before I'd {{more than}} half spoken what was in my mind. 'After that jump of mine I'll back myself against the whole farm gang.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Mostly a-foot,' he rejoined; '{{sometimes}} in carts {{along with}} {{people going to}} market; sometimes in empty coaches. Many mile a day a-foot, and often with some poor soldier or another, travelling to see his friends. I couldn't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him,' <b>said</b> Mr. Peggotty, 'nor he to me; but we was company for one another, too, along the dusty roads.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is no good}} <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> him," [...] <b>said</b> a Dragon-fly, who {{was sitting}} {{on the top of a}} large brown bulrush; [...] "no good at all, for he has gone away." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It’s no good <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> her," [...] <b>said</b> the mother, {{with a look}} of fat {{resignation}} on her face, [...] "we {{can only}} let her go her own way; if you <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her twenty-four hours right off it wouldn’t do her any good." ...|$|R
5000|$|Salad Fingers is seen <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> [...] "Milford Cubicle", {{still hanging}} from the meat hook he was placed upon in Episode 3, trying to persuade the now heavily decayed corpse {{to take a bath}} for Hubert Cumberdale's birthday. Immediately afterwards, he starts <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>said</b> finger puppet, now dressed in a hat and with some legs pinned upon him. Salad Fingers answers a knock at the door, only to see a long, thick metal pole {{stretching}} upwards further than the eye can see. Perplexed by this, he goes back indoors but causes Milford to fall from his hook. He reveals the ability to widen his irises and cause his teeth to move, making a music box-like tune, by moving his hand at {{the side of his head}} as though turning a handle. When this still fails to rouse his lifeless friend, he decides to leave the house, leaving [...] "Horace", the toy horse that appeared in Episode 6, [...] "in charge".|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right; he won't mind. He's fond of <b>talking.</b> He'd <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> anyone," [...] <b>said</b> Sid, reassuringly, {{and added}} a perplexing bit of Londonized Latin. [...] "He doesn't pute anything, non alienum. You know." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'It is {{for want}} of some one <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him,' <b>said</b> Amabel. 'I know how he broods over his sad recollections, and Redclyffe must make it so much worse.

6000|$|... "I can't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him," [...] <b>said</b> I, diffident of my Spanish. I had {{received}} lessons in England from Maria Daguilar; but six weeks is little enough for making love, {{let alone the}} learning of a foreign language.|$|R
