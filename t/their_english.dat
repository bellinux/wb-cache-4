It is, however, widely observed in England that no two families may use the same crest.

5|$|Between 911 and 919, Edward {{expanded}} his {{control over the}} rest of England south of the Humber, establishing in Essex and Mercia burhs, often designed to control the use of a river by the Danes. In 917, the Danish position in the area suddenly collapsed. A rapid succession of defeats culminated in the loss of the territories of Northampton and Huntingdon, along with the remainder of Essex: a Danish king, probably from East Anglia, was killed at Tempsford. Despite reinforcement from overseas, the Danish counter-attacks were crushed, and following the defection of many of <b>their</b> <b>English</b> subjects as Edward's army advanced, the Danes of East Anglia and Cambridge both capitulated.|$|E

The Scottish soldiery, many of whom were veterans of the Thirty Years' War, had far greater morale and training compared to <b>their</b> <b>English</b> counterparts. They met virtually no resistance until reaching Newcastle upon Tyne, where they defeated the English forces at the Battle of Newburn and occupied the city, as well as the neighbouring county of Durham.|$|E
5|$|By {{the eighteenth}} century many poorer girls were being taught in dame schools, informally set up by a widow or {{spinster}} to teach reading, sewing and cooking. Among members of the aristocracy by the early eighteenth century a girl's education was expected to include basic literacy and numeracy, needlework, cookery and household management, while polite accomplishments and piety were also emphasised. Female illiteracy rates based on signatures among female servants were around 90 percent from the late seventeenth to the early eighteenth centuries, and perhaps 85 percent for women of all ranks by 1750, compared with 35 per cent for men. Overall literacy rates were slightly higher than in England as a whole, but female rates were much lower than for <b>their</b> <b>English</b> counterparts.|$|E

Henry VIII then claimed the authority to act on behalf of Campeggio in making various ecclesiastical appointments. The fifth session of the Reformation Parliament deprived Campeggio and Girolamo Ghinucci of <b>their</b> <b>English</b> sees (unless they swore loyalty to the king).

5|$|As Australia won {{the series}} convincingly 4–0, {{it is not}} {{surprising}} that their players dominated the statistical rankings. Australian batsmen scored eight centuries to four by <b>their</b> <b>English</b> counterparts and scored their runs at a much higher average. Six of the nine highest averaging batsmen were Australian. On the bowling front, Australia's pace attack had far more success and they were a large part of the success. Lindwall and Johnston both took 27 wickets, supported by Miller and Toshack, who took 13 and 11 respectively. For England, only Bedser with 18 was able to take 10 or more wickets, and at a substantially higher cost than the Australian pacemen. The bowling was dominated by pace bowling, with Laker being the only spinner on the list, with by far the worst average. This was in large part because England agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, more frequently than under normal conditions. As a new ball is more conducive to fast bowling, this favoured fast bowlers and therefore the team with the best pace attack, in this case Australia.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 03 As Chinese {{international}} students are becoming {{an important part}} of American higher education, there is growing need of exploring their learning experiences in the United states. This study mainly discusses <b>their</b> perception of <b>English</b> learning barriers and strategies in American universities, focusing on undergraduate Chinese {{international students}}. Research questions include: What themes emerge from interviews with undergraduate Chinese international students? How do they perceive <b>their</b> academic <b>English</b> learning? In what ways do undergraduate Chinese international students improve <b>their</b> academic <b>English</b> language skills? This is a qualitative study employing personal interviews with thirteen participants. Participants are undergraduate Chinese international students at a large public university in Washington State. Close text analysis was conducted to further study how these participants perceive <b>their</b> academic <b>English</b> learning. Based on this study, undergraduate Chinese international students feel struggled with <b>their</b> academic <b>English,</b> especially in reading and writing. Students have a similar awareness of disciplinary distinctions. Most of them believe that different disciplines have different demands for academic English. They try to improve <b>their</b> academic <b>English</b> by consciously using certain strategies, including self-study as well as social interactions. These students also feel that their learning experiences are significantly influenced by social interactions with native English speakers. Intercultural communications play a great role in their perceptions of academic English learning. The implications of my findings are: (a) undergraduate Chinese international students feel they need more support with <b>their</b> academic <b>English</b> reading and writing. Students from Humanities are in need of extra help with academic writing and students from Science need to improve reading; (b) an inclusive environment should be built to make international students feel belonged, thus they can further improve their self-efficacy. Intercultural communications should be encouraged in or after class so that students can mutually better understand each other. (c) Multilingual teaching is beneficial for second language learners as they can learn <b>English</b> without losing <b>their</b> own community and identity...|$|R

5|$|Church {{architecture}} in Scotland incorporates all church building within the modern borders of Scotland, {{from the earliest}} Christian structures in the sixth century until the present day. The early Christian churches {{for which there is}} evidence are basic masonry-built constructions on the west coast and islands. As Christianity spread, local churches tended to remain much simpler than <b>their</b> <b>English</b> counterparts. By the eighth century more sophisticated ashlar block-built buildings began to be constructed. From the eleventh century, there were larger and more ornate Romanesque buildings, as with Dunfermline Abbey and St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney. From the twelfth century the introduction of new monastic orders led to a boom in ecclesiastical building, often using English and Continental forms. From the thirteenth century elements of the European Gothic style began to appear in Scotland, cumulating in buildings such as Glasgow Cathedral and the rebuilt Melrose Abbey. Renaissance influences can be seen in a move to a low-massive style that was probably influenced by contacts with Italy and the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Cook and Evans argue that, despite {{suffrage}} in Wales {{being introduced}} {{by a new}} generation of immigrant middle-class women, there was still a definite 'Welshness' to the ideology fostered by the nation, which was at loggerheads with <b>their</b> <b>English</b> counterparts. Wales had shown an independent resistance to the EFF and David Lloyd George was still a national institution, despite his prominent role in the government making him an obvious target for disruption. In 1911, after the Women's Coronation Procession, Edith Mansell Moullin formed the Cymric Suffrage Union, a Welsh society based in London. It attempted to link women's suffrage with Wales and Welshness, and sought to unite both Welsh men and women living in the capital to their cause. They distributed hand-bills written in Welsh to the Welsh chapels in London and translated pamphlets of the Conciliation Bill. The Union also expressed their nationality through dressing in traditional Welsh costume during parades and unlike many unions in Wales actually addressed their membership in Welsh as well as the English language at meetings. In 1912 after Lloyd George scuppered the third Conciliation Bill, Mansell Moullin quit the organisation and formed the Forward Cymric Suffrage Union, which had a more militant policy. Members wore red dragon badges with the motto 'O Iesu, n'ad Gamwaith' ('Oh Jesus do not allow unfairness').|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, the Home Office {{published}} a report evaluating {{the effectiveness of}} the Gateway Protection Programme. The research it was based upon focused on refugees' integration into British society in the 18 months following their resettlement. The research found that refugees showed signs of integration, including the formation of social bonds through community groups and places of worship. The report noted that low employment rates and slow progress with acquiring English language skills were particular concerns. Younger refugees and children had made the most progress. No specific language lessons are provided under the Gateway Protection Programme. Instead, Gateway refugees who require help with <b>their</b> <b>English</b> language skills are provided with access to mainstream English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) courses, which are run by a range of state, voluntary and community-based organisations. However, the International Catholic Migration Commission (ICMC) Europe reports that in Sheffield, it can be difficult for resettled refugees to gain access to ESOL classes because demand has generally exceeded supply – a situation also noted by an evaluation of the scheme's operation in Motherwell undertaken in 2013. The Motherwell evaluation found that most of the male refugees were in employment, but that many of them were not in jobs that allowed them to use their skills. The majority of women were not in work, reflecting a lack of job opportunities but also a lack of childcare provision.|$|E
