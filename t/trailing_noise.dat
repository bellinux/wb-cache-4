We investigated {{the effect of this}} chronic hearing loss on the representation of a voice onset time (VOT) and a gap-duration continuum in primary auditory cortex (AI) in cats, which were exposed at the age of 6 weeks to a 120 -dB SPL, 5 -kHz 1 / 3 octave noise band for 2  h. The resulting hearing loss measured using auditory brainstem responses and cortical multiunit thresholds at 4 – 6 months of age was 20 – 40  dB between 1 and 32  kHz. Multiple single-unit activity was recorded in seven noise-exposed cats and nine control cats related to the presentation of a/ba/–/pa/ continuum in which VOT was varied in 5 -ms step from 0 to 70  ms. We also obtained data for noise bursts with gaps, of duration equal to the VOT, embedded in noise 5  ms after the onset. Both stimuli were presented at 65  dB SPL. Minimum VOT and early-gap duration were defined as the lowest value in which an on-response, significantly above the spontaneous activity, to both the leading and <b>trailing</b> <b>noise</b> bursts or vowel was obtained. The mild chronic noise-induced hearing loss increased the minimum detectable VOT and gap duration by 10  ms. We also analyzed the maximum firing rate (FRmax) and the latency of the responses as a function of VOT and gap duration and found a significant reduction in the FRmax to the <b>trailing</b> <b>noise</b> burst for gap durations above 50  ms.

40|$|We compare {{spatially}} averaged Rayleigh wave attenuation between 10 and 18 sec period observed on the symmetric component of ambient noise cross-correlations with regional seismic event measurements observed by the USArray Transportable Array across the western US. The ambient noise attenuation measurements are {{shown to be}} consistent with attenuation observed following an earthquake in Nevada and a mining blast in Wyoming. We further demonstrate that common ambient noise data processing procedures such as temporal normalization and spectral whitening can be retained as long as the amplitudes of the cross-correlations are corrected for (1) the duration of the ambient noise cross-correlation, (2) geometrical spreading, and (3) the azimuthal variation in the strength of ambient noise sources. Correction for time-series length can be achieved accurately by dividing the empirical Green’s function by the squared rootmean-squared (rms) amplitude of the <b>trailing</b> <b>noise.</b> These results provide strong justification for the ability to constrain seismic attenuation using ambient noise with only slight refinements to traditional data processing schemes.

In this paper, <b>trailing</b> edge <b>noise</b> and turbulent inflow noise are modeled using Amiet’s theory to predict wind turbine noise spectra, directivity and amplitude modulation. First, by comparing model predictions with wind tunnel experiments from the literature, we show that a wall pressure spectral model that includes the effect of an adverse pressure gradient is needed to correctly predict <b>trailing</b> edge <b>noise</b> spectra. Then, we adapt the model to rotating blades and compare sound power level spectra of <b>trailing</b> edge <b>noise</b> with field measurements, assuming a constant wind speed profile.

40|$|The {{efficient}} computation of turbulent airfoil <b>trailing</b> edge <b>noise</b> {{is important}} for the cost-effective design of fixed and rotary-wing aircraft, wind turbines, fans and submarines. Recently, the computation of <b>trailing</b> edge <b>noise</b> has mainly been attempted using either direct or hybrid methods of computational aeroacoustics (CAA). However, many of these approaches rely on expensive transient flow solution methods for acoustic source term calculation, such as direct numerical simulation (DNS) or large eddy simulation (LES), which aren't appropriate for engineering design purposes. This paper will present a new approach for calculating turbulent <b>trailing</b> edge <b>noise.</b> Instead of using DNS or LES for a flow solution, the method uses mean flow solutions (Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes or RANS) and a statistical model to calculate acoustic source terms and radiated far-field noise.

For the purposes of validation, the model will use mean flow data from both DNS and RANS solutions to calculate the acoustic source terms.

40|$|The use of open-porous, flow-permeable {{materials}} is one possible method {{to reduce the}} generation of flow induced noise, for example at {{the trailing edge of}} wings or airfoils. Subject of the present dissertation is an experimental study of the noise generation at the trailing edge of porous airfoils compared to that of a non-porous reference airfoil of equal chord length. This includes the investigation of the mechanisms responsible for the noise reduction. Additionally, it is of special interest how the different parameters of the porous materials affect the noise generation. Detailed experiments were conducted on a non-porous reference airfoil and a set of 16 porous airfoils at various flow speeds in an open jet wind tunnel. All measurements were performed in subsonic flow, the corresponding maximum chord based Reynolds number is approximately 780, 000. The porous materials are mainly characterized by their air flow resistivity. The acoustic measurements were performed using microphone array technology and the resulting data were processed by the application of an advanced three-dimensional beamforming algorithm. To include the aerodynamic efficiency of the porous airfoils in the analysis of the potential <b>trailing</b> edge <b>noise</b> reduction, the corresponding lift forces and drag forces have been measured. Additional hot-wire measurements in the turbulent boundary layer of a subset of the airfoils were performed to enable conclusions on the physical mechanisms that are responsible for the <b>trailing</b> edge <b>noise</b> reduction. In the examined range of frequencies, it was found that a noticeable <b>trailing</b> edge <b>noise</b> reduction can be achieved through the use of porous airfoils despite losses in aerodynamic efficiency. The highest noise reduction per unit lift force was measured for porous airfoils with medium to high air flow resistivities. While a <b>trailing</b> edge <b>noise</b> reduction was observed mainly at medium frequencies, the <b>trailing</b> edge <b>noise</b> spectra of porous airfoils with low and medium air flow resistivities were found to exceed the <b>trailing</b> edge <b>noise</b> of the reference airfoil at high frequencies. This is assumed to be a contribution of surface roughness noise, since the porous materials are characterized by an increased surface roughness compared to the rather smooth surface of the reference airfoil. The boundary layer thickness as well as the boundary layer displacement thickness of the porous airfoils are noticeably larger than that measured at the reference airfoil. The examination of spectra of the turbulent velocity fluctuations showed that the peak measured above the trailing edge of the porous airfoils is at a noticeably lower frequency than that measured at the reference airfoil. Additionally, turbulence spectra measured at different chord positions along the surface of the airfoils revealed that the cause of the measured <b>trailing</b> edge <b>noise</b> reduction at medium and high frequencies may be a shift of the spectra toward lower frequencies with increasing chord position. And while this shift could be observed for both the reference airfoil and the porous airfoils, it is notably stronger for the porous airfoils. The results of the hot-wire measurements also lead to the assumption that the high frequency range of the velocity fluctuations is damped when the turbulence convects over the surface of the porous airfoils, an effect called hydrodynamic damping. Based on turbulence spectra measured above the trailing edge of five airfoils, a simple <b>trailing</b> edge <b>noise</b> prediction model was developed following the fundamental theory by Ffowcs Williams and Hall on the generation of noise {{in the vicinity of the}} edge of a semi-infinite flat plate. It is thereby assumed that the spectral shape of the <b>trailing</b> edge <b>noise</b> is related to the spectral shape of the turbulent velocity fluctuations in close proximity to the trailing edge, while the overall amplitude is determined by a convection velocity that is proportional to the mean flow velocity of the fluctuations. One possible application of the resulting model is the prediction of the <b>trailing</b> edge <b>noise</b> based on the input of the measured turbulence spectrum and the corresponding mean flow velocity close to the trailing edge of an airfoil. A more convenient application of the model is the <b>trailing</b> edge <b>noise</b> prediction based on an estimated turbulence spectrum and the corresponding mean flow velocity based on approximations developed in the present dissertation, without the necessity of detailed constant temperature anemometry measurements. The agreement between predicted and measured <b>trailing</b> edge <b>noise</b> spectra was found to be satisfying for both cases, especially when considering the rather basic approach of the model. Die Verwendung von offen-porösem, luftdurchlässigem Material ist eine mögliche Methode zur Minderung der Schallentstehung durch Umströmung, wie zum Beispiel an der Hinterkante von Schaufelprofilen oder Tragflügeln. Inhalt der vorliegenden Dissertation ist die experimentelle Untersuchung der Schallentstehung an der Hinterkante poröser Profile verglichen mit der Schallentstehung an der Hinterkante eines nichtporösen Referenzprofils gleicher Sehnenlänge. Die Studie beinhaltet zudem die Untersuchung der für die Schallminderung verantwortlichen Mechanismen sowie des Einflusses der Materialparameter der porösen Profile auf die Schallentstehung. In einem Freistrahlwindkanal fanden bei einer Reihe von subsonischen Strömungsgeschwindigkeiten umfangreiche Messungen an einem nichtporösen Referenzprofil und 16 porösen Profilen statt. Die maximale Reynoldszahl betrug etwa 780. 000. Die porösen Materialien werden in erster Linie durch ihren längenbezogenen Strömungswiderstand charakterisiert. Akustische Messungen im Windkanal wurden mit Hilfe der Mikrofonarraymesstechnik durchgeführt, die Verarbeitung der Messdaten erfolgte mit Hilfe eines dreidimensionalen Beamforming-Algorithmus. Um die aerodynamische Effizienz der porösen Profile in die Auswertung einzubeziehen, erfolgte die Messung von Auftriebskraft und Widerstandskraft. Um Rückschlüsse auf die zugrunde liegenden Mechanismen der Schallreduktion zu erlauben, wurden zusätzliche Hitzdrahtmessungen in der Grenzschicht ausgewählter Profile durchgeführt. Die Ergebnisse der Untersuchungen zeigen, dass sich trotz aerodynamischer Verluste eine deutliche Minderung des Hinterkantenschalls durch den Einsatz poröser Profile erzielen lässt. Die größte Schallreduktion pro Auftriebskraft konnte für poröse Profile mit mittleren und hohen längenbezogenen Strömungswiderständen gemessen werden. Bei sehr hohen Frequenzen erzeugen poröse Profile mit geringen und mittleren längenbezogenen Strömungswiderständen zum Teil einen gegenüber dem Referenzprofil erhöhten Schalldruckpegel, wobei vermutet wird, dass dies ein Effekt der Oberflächenrauigkeit der porösen Profile und damit ein Beitrag von Rauigkeitslärm ist. Poröse Profile weisen gegenüber dem nichtporösen Profil eine größere Grenzschichtdicke als auch eine größere Grenzschichtverdrängungsdicke auf. Die Untersuchung der Spektren der Schwankungsgeschwindigkeit innerhalb der turbulenten Grenzschicht über der Hinterkante der Profile zeigte, dass das Maximum der Turbulenz für die porösen Profile bei deutlich tieferen Frequenzen liegt als das Maximum der über der Hinterkante des Referenzprofils gemessenen Turbulenz. Messungen der Turbulenzspektren an verschiedenen Positionen entlang der Oberfläche der Profile in Strömungsrichtung ergaben zudem, dass die mutmaßliche Ursache der Schallminderung durch die porösen Profile eine Verschiebung der Turbulenzspektren mit zunehmendem Abstand von der Vorderkante hin zu niedrigeren Frequenzen ist. Diese Verschiebung wurde sowohl für das Referenzprofil als auch für die porösen Profile festgestellt, jedoch ist sie im Fall der porösen Profile viel deutlicher ausgeprägt. Die Ergebnisse der Hitzdrahtmessungen führten darüber hinaus zu der Annahme, dass ein Teil der turbulenten kinetischen Energie im Bereich hoher Frequenzen bei der Konvektion über die Oberfläche der porösen Profile gedämpft wird. Basierend auf über der Hinterkante von fünf Profilen gemessenen Turbulenzspektren wurde in Anlehnung an die Theorie von Ffowcs Williams und Hall über die Schallentstehung an einer halbunendlichen Platte ein einfaches Modell zur Vorhersage von Hinterkantenschall entwickelt. Die dabei zugrunde liegende Annahme ist, dass das Spektrum des Hinterkantenschalls von den gemessenen Turbulenzspektren abgeleitet werden kann, während die Amplitude eine Folge der Turbulenzkonvektionsgeschwindigkeit ist. Ein möglicher Einsatz des Vorhersagemodells ist die Berechnung des Hinterkantenschalls aus gemessenen Turbulenzspektren und den entsprechenden gemessenen mittleren Geschwindigkeiten in der Nähe der Hinterkante. Eine zweckmäßigere Einsatzmöglichkeit ist jedoch die Berechnung des Hinterkantenschalls aus modellierten Turbulenzspektren und Konvektionsgeschwindigkeiten, ohne die Notwendigkeit von detaillierten Hitzdrahtmessungen. Ein Vergleich zwischen gemessenen und vorhergesagten Hinterkantenschalldruckspektren zeigte in beiden Fällen eine zufriedenstellende Übereinstimmung, vor allem vor dem Hintergrund des relativ einfachen Modellansatzes...|$|R
