30|$|From Table  5, it was {{observed}} that in most of the reported studies, the maximum sorption capacity of these six azo dyes was obtained at acidic pH (between 2 and 3) and sometimes at different temperatures. However, this communication represents the sorption at natural pH of dye solution and ambient temperature. Spent R. arrhizus biomass furnished maximum sorption capacity for dye metanil yellow (128.5  mg/g) and dye sunset yellow FCF (51.9  mg/g). <b>Tamarind</b> <b>pod</b> shells at pH 2 showed 65.04  mg/g maximum sorption capacity for dye amaranth, whereas spent biomass showed 47.0  mg/g at natural pH. In the case of dye acid red 88, 0.1  M HCl treated Azolla filiculoides biomass gave maximum sorption capacity (123.5  mg/g), while spent biomass showed 108.8  mg/g at natural pH and ambient temperature. Similarly, for dye congo red, Penicillium YW 01 and Bacterial Dietzia strain provided maximum adsorption capacity 411.53 and 170.34  mg/g, respectively, at pH 3 and 40  °C. Hydrogen peroxide treated tendu waste furnished 134.4  mg/g and that of powdered eggshell provided 95.25  mg/g maximum sorption at pH 2. The untreated tendu waste showed 46.95  mg/g maximum sorption capacity at pH 6.2 which is comparable with that of sorption capacity with spent R. arrhizus biomass (49.0  mg/g) at natural pH and ambient temperature. For dye tartrazine, papaya seeds showed 51.0  mg/g maximum sorption capacity at pH 2.5, whereas spent biomass gave 33.8  mg/g maximum sorption capacity at natural pH and ambient temperature.|$|E
40|$|The {{favorite}} {{soup for}} Thai {{particularly in the}} southern part is Southern sour curry or Keang-hleung soup. The ingredients used in the paste are turmeric rhizome, garlic, shallot and chili. However, for making the sour soup, the souring agent such as lime juice, <b>tamarind</b> <b>pod</b> or garcinia, fruit is added. This study aimed to compare quality changes, total phenolic compound and antioxidant properties of the pastes as affected of added garicia fruit during storage. It was found that the total phenolic compound content of basic paste without the garcinia, garcinia Keang-hleung paste and garcinia Keang-hleung paste without salt decreased as increased storage time. Moreover, the DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity and the ferric reducing power (FRAP) activity of the basic paste without the garcinia decreased as increased storage time. However, the DPPH radical scavenging activity and the FRAP activity of the garcinia Keang-hleung paste with and without salt increased during 2 months of storage period and then decreased as increased storage time. Total viable count (TVC) of all paste samples were in the range of 10 2 - 10 3 cfu/g. Yeast and mold counts of basic and garcinia Keang-hlueng paste were less than 30 cfu/g during storage. While, yeast and mold counts of garcinia Keang-hlueng paste without salt were less than 10 2 cfu/g during storage. Lactic acid bacteria counts of garcinia Keang-hlueng paste were less than 30 cfu/g during storage. While, lactic acid bacteria counts of the basic and garcinia Keang-hlueng paste without salt were less than 10 2 cfu/g during storage. However, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacilluus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli and coliforms were not detected in all treatments throughout the storage period. </p...|$|E

The coat color is ideally more of a red-brown rather than a black-brown and does not show tabby markings. The ‘Tamra Maew’ refers to this color as [...] "thong daeng" [...] or the color of copper.

In this paper, {{we discuss}} how <b>tamarind</b> (Tamarindus indica) <b>pod</b> shells, otherwise discarded as a waste material {{is used in the}} biosorption of Cr (VI) from aqueous solutions. Parameters like agitation time, adsorbent dosage and pH were studied at different initial Cr (VI) concentrations. The adsorption data fit well with Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. Desorption studies were performed at different concentrations of sodium hydroxide. The infrared spectra of the biomass revealed that hydroxyl, carboxyl and amide groups are involved in the uptake of Cr (VI) ...|$|R
40|$|Hexavalent Chromium {{is a major}} {{pollutant}} released during several industrial operations. In {{this study}} low-cost agro waste biosorbent <b>tamarind</b> (Tamarindus indica) <b>pod</b> shells with partial and complete Pyrolysed forms were explored {{for the removal of}} hexavalent chromium ions from aqueous solution. All the biosorption experiments were carried out in batch mode to optimize process parameters using response surface methodology. Based on central composite design, quadratic model was developed to correlate the variables to the response. Statistical analysis was carried out to identify the most influential factor for all the adsorbents. Through analysis of variance (ANOVA) it was observed that pH is significant for crude and temperature is significant for pyrolysed adsorbent. Among all the adsorbents tested, crude tamarind, removed a maximum of 96. 09 % of chromium with biomass loading of 4. 59 g / 100 ml at the optimized conditions of initial concentration 71. 7213 mg/l, pH 2. 47, and temperature o...|$|R
40|$|Tamarind as {{tropical}} plant that grow well in dry land area and savannah. The use of tamarind product {{have been known}} as raw material for spices, drinks industries, and medicine, so that this plant is assumed very important for community in dry land area. In Besipae Savannah,South Amanuban,East Nusa Tenggara, tamarind grow wild in savannah {{and it is one}} of the sources income forpoeple in that area. During the dry season savannah produce less of fresh forages therefore the fresh leaves of tamarind are used as fodder. The function of cow dung as seed access especially as tamarind, acacias and leucaena seeds were not accomplished yet. The objectives of this study was the viability of tamarind seeds which were collected from cowdung in Besipae Savannah,South Amanuban, East Nusa Tenggara. This study was designed according to factorial model in Completely Rendomized Design(CRD), with four replications. The result of this study indicated that tamarind seeds which were collected from cowdung have higher germinatioan rate and percentage of germination compare to pure seeds from pods. Seedling growth of tamarind seeds which were collected from cowdung were better than that of seedling growth of pure <b>tamarind</b> seeds from <b>pods.</b> Application of cowdung and Bobonaro clay for germination media showed that Bobonaro clay was better than that of cowdung...|$|R
