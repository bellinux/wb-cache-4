Passenger locomotives had leading bogies with two axles, fewer driving axles, and very large driving wheels in order to limit the speed at which the reciprocating parts had to move.|$|E
500|$|In 1980 the Oslo Tunnel was opened, {{allowing}} trains {{along the}} Drammen Line {{to go to}} the new Oslo Central Station, an upgrade of the former Oslo Ø. As a consequence of this, passenger trains were since the late 1980s rerouted via Drammen instead of via Roa, following the Drammen Line and the Randsfjord Line to Hønefoss. This allows the trains to pass through more densely populated areas and on trackage with more capacity.

5000|$|The trade {{language}} Chinook Jargon {{came into}} use among Carrier {{people as a}} result of European contact. Most Carrier people never knew Chinook Jargon. It appears to have been known in most areas primarily by men who had spent <b>time</b> <b>freighting</b> on the Fraser River. Knowledge of Chinook Jargon may have been more common in the southwestern part of Carrier country due to its use at Bella Coola. The southwestern dialects have more loans from Chinook Jargon than other dialects. For example, while most dialects use the Cree loan described above for [...] "money", the southwestern dialects use , which is from Chinook Jargon. The word [...] ('chief') is a loan from Chinook Jargon.|$|R

50|$|Over <b>time,</b> <b>freight</b> {{declined}} in {{importance for the}} railway, and cost pressures led to the closure of low-patronage stations across the network. By 1986, Omega Station had closed, and in 1991 the dairy co-op abandoned its siding in favour of road transport.|$|E

40|$|Freight {{transport}} adds {{no value}} but more {{cost to the}} freight it carries. They have direct influence {{on the cost of}} commodities and, as a result, the price of living. Therefore, all of the freight actors try very hard to maximise freight transport efficiency aiming at minimising overall transport and operation costs. Nevertheless, in the world of competition, what manufacturers try to achieve is not only cost but also time minimisation. Higher demand for movement of part-finished goods to reduce inventory costs leads to a higher number of <b>time</b> sensitive <b>freight</b> movements in the recent years. Aside from air transport which is an expensive mode for carrying very <b>time</b> sensitive <b>freight</b> over a long distance e. g. international level, road is a less expensive and more popular choice for less <b>time</b> sensitive <b>freight</b> over short to medium distance e. g. local and regional levels. However, increasing truck traffic piles up undesirable burdens to road users and community, including air pollution, traffic congestion, pavement deterioration, traffic safety, and sustainability etc. Consequently, the authorities try to seek for contestable alternatives to road-only mode which include road-rail intermodal. This report aims at providing a comprehensive review of the recent trends and policies of freight transport, particularly of time sensitive and contestable freight, in Australia and around the world...|$|R

50|$|Having {{acquired}} America's first Mikado (2-8-2) type when it merged the Bismarck, Great Falls and Washburn Railway in 1904, it {{was eight}} years before the Soo Line ordered a 2-8-2 of its own. Ten locomotives were ordered from the American Locomotive Company, and built by their Schenectady, New York plant in 1913. The locomotives became the L-1 class and were used for powering <b>time</b> <b>freights</b> system wide on both the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie, and Wisconsin Central. They were assisted in that role by the 1920 arrival of the 25 L-2 and L-20 class Mikados in 1920, but were bumped into lesser roles {{with the arrival of}} the 21 N-20 class 4-8-2 Mountains in 1926-1930. The 1938 delivery of four O-20 class 4-8-4 Northern made little difference to the L-1 class since the former were restricted to the Chicago-Twin Cities route.|$|R
5000|$|An {{additional}} tender {{which holds}} only water {{is called a}} [...] "canteen" [...] or [...] "auxiliary tender". During the steam era, these were not frequently used. Water tanks were placed at regular intervals along the track, making a canteen unnecessary in most cases. However, there were times that canteens proved economical. The Norfolk & Western used canteens with its giant 2-8-8-2 Y Class and 2-6-6-4 A Class locomotives on coal trains, <b>timed</b> <b>freights,</b> fast freights, and merchandise freights. Use of the canteen allowed one of the water stops to be skipped, allowing the train to avoid climbing a hill from a dead stop. Currently, Union Pacific uses canteens with its steam locomotives 844 and 3985 on excursion trains. Virtually all the trackside tanks were removed when steam locomotives were retired. Nowadays, fire hydrant hookups are used, which fills the tanks much more slowly. The canteens allow for greater range between stops.|$|R

50|$|While {{the desire}} was {{expressed}} for a continuous Murg Valley Railway from Rastatt to Freudenstadt in Baden quite early, {{the state of}} Württemberg behaved rather negatively, as there was a fear that traffic from the northern Black Forest would migrate towards Karlsruhe, while at that <b>time</b> <b>freight</b> and passengers mainly travelled over the line to Stuttgart. With the completion of negotiations of a treaty in 1908 covering the design and construction {{of the line and}} regulating cross-border railway operations, Wurtemberg finally agreed to a continuous Murg Valley Railway. Nevertheless, the ratification of this treaty was delayed to 1912. It was planned to close the gap in 1916. Despite the signing of contracts, however, no construction work started on the Württemberg section.|$|E
5000|$|Ngahere {{is located}} on the south bank of the Grey River, and State Highway 7 and the Stillwater - Westport Line (SWL) railway pass through the village. The railway reached Ngahere when an {{extension}} was built from Brunner on 1 August 1889, and it was the line's terminus until a further section to Ahaura was opened on 14 February 1890. On 1 August 1910, Ngahere became a railway junction when the Blackball Branch was opened, and this branch line operated until a flood in 1966 destroyed its bridge across the Grey River. The branch was formally closed on 21 February 1966. [...] The next year, passenger trains through Ngahere on the SWL were cancelled; since this <b>time,</b> <b>freight</b> trains of coal have been the predominant traffic through Ngahere.|$|E

50|$|The {{switches}} at Kensington Junction {{were locked}} {{so that the}} branch was completely separated up to the Ninth Avenue & 20th Street Depot, which thereby became an unneeded facility because passenger streetcar operation had ended. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>freight</b> usage of the South Brooklyn Railway declined because of {{the increasing use of}} semi-trailer trucks. The McDonald Avenue trackage was no longer in use by 1978, and paved over by 1991. After the closure of the McDonald Avenue tracks, the South Brooklyn Railway's freight operations were moved from the Second Avenue yard to the 36th-38th Street Yard, where it still operates. In 1994, the last non-NYCTA customer on the line closed; the South Brooklyn Railway was then used almost exclusively for subway connections to the LIRR Bay Ridge Branch via the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal and Bush Terminal.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the case of {{programming}} the development of future transportation systems by identifying inter-dependencies among competitors. Here, a market of maritime facilities is modelled as an n-person non-cooperative game among port authorities that promote the attractiveness of their terminal facilities, in terms of level of service provided. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>freight</b> shippers/carriers who are forming their service network based on the prevailing conditions offered by the available transportation paths are also modelled {{in the context of}} a non-cooperative game. Optimal decisions are obtained by extending the standard single leader-multiple followers Stackelberg game-theoretic formulation of the network design problem (NDP) to its complete form of multiple leaders-multiple followers competitive NDP. The estimation of the equilibrium point of the above complex transportation system is based on a novel evolutionary optimisation framework. Results from alternative design strategies are presented revealing the effects of competition and cooperation on systems design. Copyright © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd...|$|E
