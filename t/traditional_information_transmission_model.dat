40|$|Recently, <b>information</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>models</b> {{motivated}} by the classical epidemic propagation, have been applied to a wide-range of social systems, generally assume that information mainly transmits among individuals via peer-to-peer interactions on social networks. In this paper, we consider one more approach for users to get information: the out-of-social-network influence. Empirical analyses of eight typical events' diffusion on a very large micro-blogging system, Sina Weibo, show that the external influence has significant impact on information spreading along with social activities. In addition, we propose a theoretical model to interpret the spreading process via {{both internal and external}} channels, considering three essential properties: (i) memory effect; (ii) role of spreaders; and (iii) non-redundancy of contacts. Experimental and mathematical results indicate that the information indeed spreads much quicker and broader with mutual effects of the internal and external influences. More importantly, the present model reveals that the event characteristic would highly determine the essential spreading patterns once the network structure is established. The results may shed some light on the in-depth understanding of the underlying dynamics of <b>information</b> <b>transmission</b> on real social networks...|$|R

For example, {{the architecture of the}} triple-decker Victorian schools across England fits the <b>information</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>model</b> that was dominant in the industrial age, but makes it more difficult to implement student-centred pedagogies that better fit a modern knowledge society. Yet, very little is known about how to reach powerful alignment of pedagogies and physical learning spaces. This article aims to fill this gap by describing a participatory design process to help to realise physical spaces and school buildings that optimally support specific visions of learning and pedagogy. Three phases are distinguished in this design process: (1) specifying the pedagogy, (2) aligning the pedagogy with seating arrangements and physical learning spaces, and (3) realising the school building. Particular attention is given to the core tasks relating to pedagogy (phases one and two), and especially the second phase, in which school management, teachers and students on the one hand, and architects and interior designers on the other must collaborate in a participatory design process.

While the actual use of ICT in education has increased, not much change has occurred in terms of the pedagogical practices followed. <b>Information</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>models</b> of teaching are still being followed, albeit with the use of ICT. Efforts at the school level attempt to address this problem via teacher education programs that emphasize ICT integration with constructivist practices. In higher education settings, there are fewer reported studies on ICT integration at a systemic level, and most decisions related to the use of ICTs are left to the instructor. In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of ET 4 ET, a large-scale faculty professional development program (1138 participants) on effective integration of educational technology for engineering college instructors in India. Guided by the Attain-Align-Integrate (A 2 I) model, the ET 4 ET program prepares instructors to implement ICT supported student-centric teaching strategies. To ensure engagement and learning of the participants, active learning strategies are implemented throughout the ET 4 ET program.

40|$|This paper reviews {{emerging}} wireless {{information and}} power transfer (WIPT) technique {{with an emphasis}} on its performance enhancement employing multi-antenna techniques. Compared to <b>traditional</b> wireless <b>information</b> <b>transmission,</b> WIPT faces numerous challenges. First, it is more susceptible to channel fading and path loss, resulting in a much shorter power transfer distance. Second, it gives rise to the issue on how to balance spectral efficiency for <b>information</b> <b>transmission</b> and energy efficiency for power transfer in order to obtain an optimal tradeoff. Third, there exists a security issue for <b>information</b> <b>transmission</b> in order to improve power transfer efficiency. In this context, multi-antenna techniques, e. g., energy beamforming, are introduced to solve these problems by exploiting spatial degree of freedom. This article provides a tutorial on various aspects of multi-antenna based WIPT techniques, with a focus on tackling the challenges by parameter optimization and protocol design. In particular, we investigate the WIPT tradeoffs based on two typical multi-antenna techniques, namely limited feedback multi-antenna technique for short-distance transfer and large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (LS-MIMO, also known as massive MIMO) technique for long-distance transfer. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figures, IEEE Communications Magazine, April 201...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{challenges}} {{the conventional wisdom}} that trademark law traditionally sought to protect consumers and enhance marketplace efficiency. Contrary to widespread contemporary understanding, early trademark cases were decidedly producer-centered. Trademark infringement claims, like all unfair competition claims, were intended to protect producers from illegitimate attempts to divert their trade. Consumer deception was relevant in these cases only to the extent it was the means by which a competitor diverted a producer 2 ̆ 7 s trade. Moreover, American courts from the very beginning protected a party against improperly diverted trade in part by recognizing a narrow form ofproperty rights in trademarks. Those rights were derived from the natural rights theory of property that predominated in the nineteenth century and were defined quite narrowly. Reframing traditional trademark law in this way leads to two important conclusions. First, although the broad forms of protection trademark law now provides deserve sustained scrutiny, any criticisms leveled against modern doctrines must stand on their own merits and fairly confront the policy goals of modern trademark law. The criticisms cannot draw their normative force by pointing to <b>information</b> <b>transmission</b> principles that did not animate traditional trademark law. Second, and somewhat counterintuitively, expansion of trademark law in the twentieth century was more a consequence of the modern search cost rationale than a deviation from that model. Traditional trademark law contained very specific and workable restrictions on the scope of trademark protection that were weakened or rejected in the twentieth century as courts and commentators embraced the <b>information</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>model.</b> The limitations counted on by proponents of the new model have proven almost infinitely pliable and have failed to halt trademark law 2 ̆ 7 s growth...|$|R

40|$|Many {{emerging}} technologies exhibit path-dependent demands {{driven by}} positive network feedback. Such network effects profoundly impact marketing strategists' thinking in today's network economy. However, the significant network externalities expected {{by many people}} often fail to materialize in the emerging technology market.

By studying cheap-talk strategies under information asymmetry, we show that incentive-compatible contracts are essential for achieving credible <b>information</b> <b>transmission.</b> In our <b>model,</b> the better-informed technology vendor has an incentive to inflate the retailer's ex ante belief of network externalities when a wholesale price contract is adopted. When properly termed revenue-sharing contracts are implemented, there are information-efficient cheap-talk equilibria where truthful <b>information</b> <b>transmission</b> is mutually beneficial. When the vendor's information is imperfect, even revenue-sharing contracts cannot guarantee credible <b>information</b> <b>transmission</b> if there is significant prior belief disparity between the vendor and the retailer.

40|$|Strategic <b>information</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>models,</b> {{also called}} cheap talk models, have become {{increasingly}} popular in accounting, as they have successfully brought new insights to various accounting topics. This dissertation consists of two chapters, each analyzes a <b>model</b> of strategic <b>information</b> <b>transmission</b> between an expert and a decision maker. In the first chapter, I study how reputational concerns affect analysts' incentives to invest in information acquisition, and subsequently, their strategic communication with investors in form of "repeated cheap talk". In a setting where analysts' incentives may be misaligned with the investors in a particular fashion (i. e. biased towards issuing optimistic reports), an equilibrium exists in which only aligned analysts will acquire information. As a result, investors may favorably update their beliefs about the analysts' type (as being aligned) when the report {{is consistent with the}} realized state. Hence reputational concerns serve as a disciplining device to curb analysts' opportunistic behavior, consistent with economic intuition. This is in sharp contrast to earlier studies that have treated information as exogenous and identical, in which case reputational concerns may work against informative communication. The second chapter is based on joint work with Tim Baldenius and Nahum Melumad. In this work, we study the optimal board composition [...] -of monitoring and advisory "types" [...] -within a framework of strategic communication between the CEO and the board when the CEO is an empire builder. The board of directors performs the dual role of monitoring and advising the firm's management. At times, it makes certain key decisions itself. A major concern regarding the effectiveness of boards is CEO power, in particular {{as it relates to the}} board nomination process and CEO entrenchment. Monitoring types on the board aim to uncover information known to the CEO, whereas advisors aim to uncover incrementally decision-relevant information. Successful board monitoring allows for selective intervention even if authority is formally delegated to the CEO. Counter to conventional wisdom, we show that powerful CEOs, who influence the board nomination process, may in fact prefer more monitors on the board than do shareholders. Regulatory interventions (such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) that attempt to strengthen the monitoring role of boards may thus be harmful in precisely those cases where agency problems are severe. Lastly, to prevent that CEOs entrench themselves by choosing "complex" projects, shareholders may want to commit to an advisor-heavy board...|$|R

Based on nonlinear stochastic dynamic system theory, the <b>information</b> <b>transmission</b> ability can be investigated by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi inequality (HJI) -constrained optimization problem. To avoid difficulties associated with solving a complex HJI-constrained optimization problem for <b>information</b> <b>transmission</b> ability, the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is introduced to approximate the nonlinear stochastic dynamic network by interpolating several local linear stochastic dynamic networks so that a HJI-constrained optimization problem can be replaced by the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) -constrained optimization problem. The LMI problem can then be efficiently solved for measuring <b>information</b> <b>transmission</b> ability. We found that a more stable (robust) dynamic network has less <b>information</b> <b>transmission</b> ability, and vice versa. Finally, an example of a biochemical network in cellular communication is given to illustrate the measurement of <b>information</b> <b>transmission</b> ability and to confirm the results by using Monte Carlo simulations...|$|R
40|$|Actin is a {{globular}} protein which forms long polar filaments in the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. Actin networks {{play a key}} role in cell mechanics and cell motility. They have also been implicated in <b>information</b> <b>transmission</b> and processing, memory and learning in neuronal cells. The acting filaments have been shown to support propagation of voltage pulses. Here we apply a coupled nonlinear <b>transmission</b> line <b>model</b> of actin filaments to study interactions between voltage pulses. By assigning a logical Truth to the presence of a voltage pulses in a given location of the actin filament, and False to the pulse's absence we represent digital <b>information</b> <b>transmission</b> along these filaments. When two pulses, representing Boolean values of input variables, interact, then they can facilitate or inhibit further propagation of each other. We explore this phenomenon to construct Boolean logical gates and a one-bit half-adder with interacting voltage pulses. We discuss implications of these findings on cellular process and technological applications...|$|R

Whenever an equilibrium exists where the decision is delegated to the expert, it is ex ante Pareto-dominant.
