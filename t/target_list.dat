5|$|For a time, no overt {{action was}} taken, and the plans {{continued}} to evolve. A further refinement {{of the plan}} was developed by William and McGeorge Bundy on 29 November 1964, with a more moderate <b>target</b> <b>list,</b> which the Joint Chiefs opposed. No action was taken while these, and other, plans were considered. But matters {{came to a head}} with the attack on Camp Holloway on 7 February 1965, which demanded immediate action, and resulted in a reprisal raid known as Operation Flaming Dart. A sapper raid against an American enlisted men's billet at Qui Nhon on the 10th led to Flaming Dart II. These small-scale operations were launched against the southern region of the country, where the bulk of North Vietnam's ground forces and supply dumps were located.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the early nuclear arms control work, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Nathan F. Twining, sent a memorandum, in August 1959, to the Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, which {{suggested}} that the Strategic Air Command (SAC) formally be assigned responsibility to prepare the national nuclear <b>target</b> <b>list,</b> and a single plan for nuclear operations. Up to that point, the Army, Navy, and Air Force had done their own target planning. This had led to the same objectives being targeted multiple times by the different services. The separate service plans were not mutually supporting as in, for example, the Navy destroying an air defense facility on the route of an Air Force bomber going to a deeper target. While Twining had sent the memo to McElroy, the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff disagreed on the policy during early 1960. Thomas Gates, who succeeded McElroy, asked President Dwight D. Eisenhower to decide the policy.|$|E

(1) Some targets disappear from the radar’s view and do not need imaging anymore; then, it is eliminated from the <b>targets</b> <b>list.</b> (2) A new target is detected and is added into the imaged <b>targets</b> <b>list.</b> (3) The estimations of targets’ velocities and sizes are considerably different from the current ones.|$|R
40|$|In the nineties, {{the number}} of mergers has been {{increasing}} dramatically due {{to the emergence of}} the global economy and the research of the critical size and the optimal strategy. This thesis investigates the choice of accounting method (pooling versus purchasing) and the choice of the method of payment (cash versus stock) for mergers in the 90 's. We identify significant differences in market response to mergers when the <b>targets</b> were <b>listed</b> on the NYSE/Amex or on the NASDAQ. We found that mergers in the two markets tend to behave differently. When <b>targets</b> are <b>listed</b> on the NYSE, the bidder characteristics drive the choice. While, when <b>targets</b> are <b>listed</b> on the NASDAQ, the target characteristics tend to drive the choice. Finally, we found that <b>targets</b> <b>listed</b> on the NASDAQ get higher Abnormal Returns compared to <b>targets</b> <b>listed</b> on the NYSE/Amex...|$|R
5|$|The Command was too {{expensive}} to maintain and cost cuts were made during the 1950s which caused a reduction in strength. By mid-1957 the Command had been cut to 82 aircraft. By mid-1958 it had shrunk to just 67. The Shackletons dominated {{the core of this}} force, numbering 54 aircraft. The Neptune was cut from the service altogether, beginning on 31 August 1956. There was little operational action for the Command at this point. It airlifted British Army forces into Egypt during the Suez Crisis which was its major action during this period. The lack of funds and any active conventional military role saw the Command struggle to keep its front-line strength high. There was a brief alert in October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, when all six squadrons it then possessed were put on high alert, but nothing came of the crisis, although the Shackleton squadrons at RAF Ballykelly were sent to Macrihanish as it was known that Ballykelly was on the Soviet IRBM <b>target</b> <b>list.</b>|$|E

25|$|Such {{a system}} {{could be made to}} {{automatically}} steer itself through a <b>target</b> <b>list,</b> sending a pulse to each target at a constant rate. This would allow targeting of all Sun-like stars within a distance of 100 light-years. The studies have also described an automatic laser pulse detector system with a low-cost, two-meter mirror made of carbon composite materials, focusing on an array of light detectors. This automatic detector system could perform sky surveys to detect laser flashes from civilizations attempting contact.|$|E

25|$|Though Rodezno’s {{supporters}} {{complained about}} “fascistización” of the Communion {{under the new}} leadership of Fal, Carlism firmly changed course from political negotiations to organizational build-up. Rodezno was not appointed head {{of any of the}} newly created sections, nominated to Consejo de Cultura instead. Re-elected to the Cortes in 1933 and 1936, he was permitted to pursue talks with the Alfonsinos on the private business basis; in 1936 these contacts started to take shape of negotiating a joint insurgency. According to one source he was on the <b>target</b> <b>list</b> of the hit-team which, in his absence, shot Calvo Sotelo instead.|$|E
25|$|The {{fathers of}} two victims, {{one in the}} Edgware Road blast and another at Russell Square, told the BBC that police {{officers}} investigating the alleged hacking had warned them that their contact details were found on a <b>target</b> <b>list,</b> while a former firefighter who helped injured passengers escape from Edgware Road also {{said he had been}} contacted by police who were looking into the hacking allegations. A number of survivors from the bombed trains also revealed that police had warned them their phones may have been accessed and their messages intercepted, and in some cases officers advised them to change security codes and PIN numbers.|$|E
25|$|In 2011/2012 {{the process}} for {{selecting}} targets outside of warzones was altered so that power was concentrated {{in the hands of}} a group of people in the White House centered around White House counterterror chief John Brennan. Under the new plan, Brennan's staff compiles the potential <b>target</b> <b>list</b> and runs the names past agencies such as the State Department at a weekly White House meeting. According to the New York Times, President Obama has placed himself at the helm of a top secret process to designate terrorists for kill or capture, reserving the final say on approving lethal action, and signs off every strike in Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan.|$|E

25|$|Exercise Hard Rock was a {{combined}} communications and civil defence exercise planned for September and October 1982. It assumed a conventional war in Europe lasting {{two to three}} days, during which the UK would be attacked with conventional weapons, then a limited nuclear exchange, with 54 nuclear warheads used against military targets in the UK. 250,000 people protested against the exercise and 24 councils refused to participate. The limited scenario still assumed casualties of 7.9 million dead and 5 million injured. The scenario was ridiculed by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the exercise was postponed indefinitely. The New Statesman later claimed the Ministry of Defence insisted on having a veto over proposed targets in the exercise and several were removed to make them politically more acceptable; for example, the nuclear submarine base HMNB Clyde {{was removed from the}} <b>target</b> <b>list.</b>|$|E
500|$|On May 30, Stimson asked Groves {{to remove}} Kyoto from the <b>target</b> <b>list</b> {{due to its}} historical, {{religious}} and cultural significance, but Groves pointed to its military and industrial significance.

500|$|On July 25, 1967, Forrestal reached Yankee Station in the Gulf of Tonkin {{and joined}} Operation Rolling Thunder, the 1965–1968 air interdiction and {{strategic}} bombing campaign against North Vietnam. [...] The alpha strikes flown from Forrestal were against specific, pre-selected targets such as arms depots, factories, and bridges. [...] They were quite dangerous, {{due to the}} strength of the North Vietnamese air defenses, which used Soviet-designed and -supplied surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft artillery, and MiG jet interceptors. [...] McCain's first five attack missions over North Vietnam went without incident, and while still unconcerned with minor Navy regulations, McCain had garnered the reputation of a serious aviator. McCain and his fellow pilots were frustrated by the micromanagement of Rolling Thunder from Washington; he later wrote, [...] "The <b>target</b> <b>list</b> was so restricted that we had to go back and hit the same targets over and over again... Most of our pilots flying the missions believed that our targets were virtually worthless.

500|$|Beginning in 1942 the United States, with {{assistance}} from Britain and other Allied countries, devoted considerable resources to developing nuclear weapons through the Manhattan Project. In December 1944 the USAAF's 509th Composite Group was formed {{under the command}} of Colonel Paul Tibbets to deliver these weapons once they were complete; it deployed to Tinian during May and June 1945. The [...] "Trinity" [...] test of the first nuclear bomb was successfully conducted on 16July. Four days later the 509thComposite Group's modified [...] "Silverplate" [...] B-29s began flying practice raids against Japanese cities, each armed with a single high-explosive [...] "pumpkin" [...] bomb; further practice missions took place on 24, 26 and 29July. Japanese fighters did not attempt to intercept these aircraft, and their bombing altitude of [...] was beyond the range of most anti-aircraft guns. Meanwhile, on 24July President Harry S. Truman approved the use of atomic bombs against Japan, and the next day Spaatz received written orders to this effect. These orders specified that the first attack should be made after 3August, and named Hiroshima, Kokura, Niigata and Nagasaki as targets. Kyoto, Japan's former imperial capital, had been included in an earlier version of the <b>target</b> <b>list</b> but Nagasaki was substituted on the direction of US Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson owing to Kyoto's cultural value; the city had also been excluded from the urban firebombing raids on the same grounds. On 26July the United States, Britain and China issued the Potsdam Declaration, which demanded Japan's surrender after warning that the country would be devastated if the war continued. The Japanese government rejected the Allied demands on 28July.|$|E
500|$|After being {{released}} from supporting the Okinawa campaign, XXIBomber Command conducted an intensive firebombing campaign against Japan's main cities from mid-May. A force of 472 B-29s struck Nagoya by day on 13May and destroyed [...] of the city. The Japanese mounted a strong defense that downed two Superfortresses and damaged another 64; another eight B-29s were lost to other causes. The Americans claimed 18 Japanese fighter [...] "kills" [...] as well as another 30 [...] "probables" [...] and 16 damaged. Nagoya was attacked again by 457 B-29s {{on the night of}} 16May, and the resulting fires destroyed [...] of the city. Japanese defenses were much weaker by night, and the three bombers lost in this attack crashed due to mechanical problems. The two raids on Nagoya killed 3,866 Japanese and rendered another 472,701 homeless. On 19May, 318 B-29s conducted an unsuccessful precision bombing raid on the Tachikawa Aircraft Company. XXIBomber Command made further large-scale firebombing attacks against Tokyo on the nights of 23 and 25May. In the first of these raids 520 B-29s destroyed [...] of southern Tokyo with 17 aircraft lost and 69 damaged. The second attack involved 502 B-29s and destroyed [...] of the city's central area, including the headquarters of several key government ministries and much of the Tokyo Imperial Palace; the bomber crews had been briefed to not target the palace as the US Government did not want to risk killing Emperor Hirohito. The Japanese defenses were relatively successful on this occasion, and 26 Superfortresses were shot down and another 100 damaged. By the end of these raids just over half (50.8percent) of Tokyo had been destroyed and the city was removed from XXIBomber Command's <b>target</b> <b>list.</b> The Command's last major raid of May was a daylight incendiary attack on Yokohama on 29May conducted by 517 B-29s escorted by 101 P-51s. This force was intercepted by 150 A6M Zero fighters, sparking an intense air battle in which five B-29s were shot down and another 175 damaged. In return, the P-51 pilots claimed 26 [...] "kills" [...] and 23 [...] "probables" [...] for the loss of three fighters. The 454 B-29s that reached Yokohama struck the city's main business district and destroyed [...] of buildings; over 1000 Japanese were killed. Overall, the attacks in May destroyed [...] of buildings, which was equivalent to one seventh of Japan's total urban area.
