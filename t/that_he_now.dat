5|$|The {{origins of}} the episode come from a {{conversation}} between Jane O'Brien and Mike Scully, when the two {{were talking about how}} girls always want to grow up so fast, as Scully has five daughters; so they decided to produce an episode with a storyline based on this. The idea behind the episode plot came from Jace Richdale, {{who came up with the}} idea of Homer stealing grease and the grease business, having read about in a magazine. Several aspects of the characters used throughout the episode had been improvised significantly by Lisa Kudrow. Ron Hauge, a writer for The Simpsons, came up with the initial character of Alex, and Jane O'Brien named the character after her best friend. The scene showing Homer's hemorrhaged eye as Groundskeeper Willie strangles him got a big laugh in the studio. Mike Scully comments <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>now</b> uses it in college clip shows.|$|E

5|$|The next {{species of}} Stegosaurus {{to be named}} was S. marshi, by Frederick Lucas in 1901. Lucas {{reclassified}} this species in the new genus Hoplitosaurus later that year. Lucas also re-examined {{the issue of the}} life appearance of Stegosaurus, coming {{to the conclusion that the}} plates were arranged in pairs in two rows along the back, arranged above the bases of the ribs. Lucas commissioned Charles R. Knight to produce a life restoration of S. ungulatus based on his new interpretation. However, the following year, Lucas wrote <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>now</b> believed the plates were probably attached in staggered rows. In 1910, Richard Swann Lull wrote that the alternating pattern seen in S. stenops was probably due to shifting of the skeleton after death. He led the construction of the first ever Stegosaurus skeletal mount at the Peabody Museum of Natural History, which was depicted with paired plates. In 1914, Charles Gilmore argued against Lull's interpretation, noting that several specimens of S. stenops, including the now-completely prepared holotype, preserved the plates in alternating rows near the peak of the back, and that there was no evidence of the plates having shifted relative to the body during fossilization. Gilmore and Lucas' interpretation became the generally accepted standard, and Lull's mount at the Peabody Museum was changed to reflect this in 1924.|$|E
