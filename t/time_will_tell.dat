25|$|As in Egypt and {{the eastern}} Mediterranean, {{radiocarbon}} dates run one or two centuries earlier than the dates proposed by archaeologists. It {{is not at all}} clear which group is right, if either. Mechanisms have been proposed for explaining why radiocarbon dates in the region might be skewed. Equally logical arguments have been made suggesting that the archaeological dates are too late. <b>Time</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell.</b> The spread of accelerator based carbon dating techniques may help clear up the issue. Another promising front is the dating of lime plaster from structures. Recently, radiocarbon dates from the final destruction of Ebla have been shown to definitely favour the middle chronology (with the fall of Babylon and Aleppo at c. 1595 BCE), and do not seem to fall with the ultra-low chronology (same event at c. 1499 BCE), although it is emphasized that this is not to be seen as a decisive argument.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the North African Sephardic dialect was, {{until the early}} 20th century, also highly conservative; its {{abundant}} Colloquial Arabic loan words retained most of the Arabic phonemes as functional components of a new, enriched Hispano-Semitic phonological system. During the Spanish colonial occupation of Northern Morocco (1912–1956), Ḥakitía was subjected to pervasive, massive influence from Modern Standard Spanish and most Moroccan Jews now speak a colloquial, Andalusian form of Spanish, with only an occasional use of the old language {{as a sign of}} in-group solidarity, somewhat as American Jews may now use an occasional Yiddishism in colloquial speech. Except for certain younger individuals, who continue to practice Ḥakitía as a matter of cultural pride, this splendid dialect, probably the most Arabized of the Romance languages apart from Mozarabic, has essentially ceased to exist. By contrast, Eastern Judeo-Spanish has fared somewhat better, especially in Israel, where newspapers, radio broadcasts, and elementary school and university programs strive to keep the language alive. But the old regional variations (i.e. Bosnia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and Turkey for instance) are already either extinct or doomed to extinction. Only <b>time</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> whether Judeo-Spanish koiné, now evolving in Israel—similar to that which developed among Sephardic immigrants to the United States early in the 20th century will prevail and survive into the next generation.|$|E

Christina Garibaldi of MTV News was complimentary of the song, praising Carey's [...] "impressive" [...] vocal range and specifically {{drawing attention to}} the high note that she ends the song with. Garibaldi stated that [...] "You're Mine (Eternal)" [...] serves as a reminder as to why Carey is [...] "still the fiercest diva in the game".

Jamieson Cox of Time echoed Garibaldi's sentiments, writing [...] "It's a gaseous, fluffy ballad that feels like a direct descendant of the song that rang in her mid-career renaissance, 2005's mega-hit 'We Belong Together': plinking piano melodies, a typically fluttering Carey vocal take, and a very similar beat.

2500|$|In 2006 a {{post-mortem}} inquest {{into the}} death of Carol Cross at age 58, who was exposed to the contaminated drinking water aged 44, showed that her brain contained 23 micrograms of aluminium per gram of brain, compared to the normal brain levels of 0–2 micrograms per gram.

[...] Chris Kelly of Fact said, [...] "While My Krazy Life is YG’s debut, it feels more like an album-length celebration of Mustard’s ratchet revolution, a sound distilled from LA G-Funk, Atlanta snap and Bay Area hyphy. [...] <b>Time</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> if {{this is the beginning of}} a new era for hip-hop or simply a time capsule of a sound that had its day in the sun." [...] Brian Josephs of XXL said, [...] "As good as My Krazy Life is, it lacks imagination. There's no desire to transcend West Coast inner-city values, and YG does traverse the hyphy and nighttime sounds with aplomb. But the thrills do have a comedown at some point. For the album as a whole, it's the potentially ephemeral replay value because of its on-the-nose focus on 20-somethings mayhem." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alexander Zubov of Kot-in-Action Creative Artel who {{developed}} the Steel Storm games complained in an interview about the trouble he had getting his games accepted into the Bundles, originally trying to push their game's first episode as a free bonus for the second Bundle, {{and then trying to}} get their full game into the third. Zubov recalls that he had heard [...] "nothing back" [...] until they made a [...] "last minute decision" [...] to include Steel Storm: Burning Retribution in the Humble Indie Bundle 3.

[...] He also mentioned that despite claims by the organizers that their sales would [...] "sky rocket just because [...] were in the HIB3", their actual amount of sales remained relatively constant. Zubov noted that their inclusion in the third bundle [...] "did get a lot of users who redeemed their copy of Steel Storm on Steam and Desura" [...] and that they hoped this would help keep their [...] "current user base, which we gained with HIB3, interested in our upcoming games". He concluded his comments about his experiences by saying that [...] "only <b>time</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> if HIB3 was [...] awesome deal or not. Maybe, maybe not.
