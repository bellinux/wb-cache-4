During <b>the</b> <b>predawn</b> hours of 12 May, elements of the PAVN 2nd Division continued to increase their pressure on the main compound of the Special Forces Camp. The North Vietnamese made final preparations for the main assault by capturing one mountain outpost at a time, which were manned by U.S. soldiers of the Americal Division, who had placed machine-guns around the main camp as advanced defensive positions. At 04:23, U.S. soldiers reported that outpost number 1 had been overrun, and fighter-bombers were scrambled in an attempt to save it. About 30 minutes later, the defenders of outpost number 7 reported that their position had been surrounded. They attempted to hold their position by calling on an AC-47 gunship to fire directly into their position, in order to stop the attack, but soon afterwards outpost 7 succumbed to the North Vietnamese and the defenders retreated back to Khâm Đức.|$|E

40|$|Xylem {{pressure}} potential of Bromus inermis and Andropogon scoparius was measured at predawn and at midday on the Oldfather Prairie west of Kearney, Nebraska (41 ° 422 ̆ 7 N, 99 ° 082 ̆ 7 W). This mixed-grass prairie {{is characterized by}} patches of B. inermis and A. scoparius growing in close proximity. Ten replicate {{pressure potential}} measurements were made weekly during the 1993 growing season. Water potential remained uniformly high and unchanged throughout <b>the</b> season at <b>predawn</b> for both species.

Despite abnormally high rainfall (nearly 750 mm) in 1993, the data support the notion of tight coupling between A. scoparius and the water environment. The water potential deficit and extreme lows for B. inermis (- 2. 1 MPa) and A. scoparius (- 1. 4 MPa) indicate further that B. inermis may be less efficient yet more opportunistic in water use than A. scoparius.

40|$|The {{existence}} in the lunar atmosphere of helium, neon, argon, and possibly molecular hydrogen has been confirmed by the Apollo 17 mass spectrometer. The observed helium concentrations and distribution agree closely with model predictions for a non-condensable gas based on a solar wind source, thermal escape and a Monte Carlo random walk calculated longitudinal distribution. Heavier gases are lost by photoionization and subsequent sweeping away by the solar wind electric field. The observed nighttime neon concentration of 80, 000 molecules per cu cm is consistent with expected amounts. Argon, however, is adsorbed on the lunar surface late at night when the surface temperature is lowest. It shows <b>the</b> expected <b>predawn</b> enhancement exhibited by condensable gases released into the atmosphere at the sunrise terminator.

40|$|The diurnal {{variations}} of electron content and shape factor observed at an equatorial station during sunspot minimum are {{shown to be}} consistent with the electron density profiles observed at Jicamarca during sunspot minimum. The rapid increase in electron content and the shape factor at sunrise results from the EUV production of ionization in the E and F regions. Day-to-day variations in daytime electron content are observed to be quite small at the equator. The evening decrease in the shape factor results from an upward drift of the F region at sunset and the evening decay of the E and bottomside F regions. The nighttime peak or plateau in the shape factor is produced by the slow downward drift of the electron density profile. <b>The</b> deep <b>predawn</b> dip in <b>the</b> shape factor is caused by the main peak of the F layer reaching low altitudes where high loss rates cause a large reduction in ionization below 300 km and very flat electron density profile...|$|R

On 24 April, German motorcyclists, followed by tanks and motorized infantry, attacked down the Lamia road. The tanks were destroyed by the Australian artillery, but the German infantry attempted to turn 25 Battalion's flank, which was refused.

The infantry companies retreated as scheduled towards the Peloponnese beaches, as plans had been changed because of the German advance. 24 Battalion took positions around Tripolis in response to German paratroop drops on the Isthmus of Corinth.
