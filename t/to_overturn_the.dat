5|$|Also in 1957, Florida's {{response}} was mixed. Its legislature passed an Interposition Resolution denouncing {{the decision and}} declaring it null and void. But Florida Governor LeRoy Collins, though joining in the protest against the court decision, refused to sign it, arguing that the attempt <b>to</b> <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> ruling must be done by legal methods.|$|E
5|$|France2 {{appealed to}} the Court of Cassation (supreme court). In February 2012 it quashed the {{decision}} of the appeal court <b>to</b> <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> conviction, ruling that the court should not have asked France2 to provide the raw footage. The case was sent back to the appeal court, which convicted Karsenty of defamation in 2013 and fined him €7,000.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{willingness}} of the players to cross the picket lines and networks to broadcast the replacement games, despite a 20% drop in television viewership and even steeper drops in attendance, the union failed to achieve their demands. The strike ended on October 15, 1987, without a collective bargaining agreement in place. The union filed a new antitrust lawsuit on December 30 asking federal judge David Doty <b>to</b> <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> league's restricting free agent policies.|$|E

5|$|In the November 2, 1880 {{election}} for Pima County sheriff, Democrat Shibell ran against Republican Bob Paul, who {{was expected to}} win. Votes arrived as late as November 7, and Shibell was unexpectedly reelected. He immediately appointed Johnny Behan as the new deputy sheriff for eastern Pima County, a job that Wyatt wanted. A controversy ensued when Paul uncovered ballot-stuffing by Cowboys and he sued <b>to</b> <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> election.|$|E
5|$|This was {{a blow to}} the {{short-range}} committee, who {{had made}} good progress on the specification. Despite being technically superior, FACT had not been created with portability in mind or through manufacturer and user consensus. It also lacked a demonstrable implementation, allowing supporters of a FLOW-MATIC-based COBOL <b>to</b> <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> resolution. RCA representative Howard Bromberg also blocked FACT, so that RCA's work on a COBOL implementation would not go to waste.|$|E
5|$|Thorne {{then brought}} suit {{in federal court}} <b>to</b> <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> discharge; the court ordered his {{reinstatement}} while the case proceeded. After he lost his challenge to DADT in both U.S. District Court and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court declined to hear his appeal on October 19, 1998, and he was again discharged.|$|E

Texas that proved crucial <b>to</b> <b>overturning</b> <b>the</b> 2010 conviction of Tom DeLay of money laundering and conspiracy. The brief argued that the legal theory used by prosecutors violated the First Amendment, exposing citizens like DeLay to criminal charges simply for engaging in politics.|$|R

5|$|Pitt is a {{supporter}} of same-sex marriage. In an October 2006 interview with Esquire, Pitt {{said that he would}} marry Jolie when everyone in America is legally able to marry. In September 2008, he donated $100,000 to the campaign against California's 2008 ballot proposition Proposition 8, an initiative <b>to</b> <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> state Supreme Court decision that had legalized same-sex marriage. In March 2012, Pitt was featured in a performance of Dustin Lance Black's play, '8'— a staged reenactment of the federal trial that overturned California's Prop 8 ban on same-sex marriage— as Judge Vaughn Walker.|$|E
5|$|Proponents of the Act, {{including}} Trumbull and Wilson, {{argued that}} Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment authorized {{the federal government}} to legislate civil rights for the States. Others disagreed, maintaining that inequality conditions were distinct from slavery. Seeking more substantial justification, and fearing that future opponents would again seek <b>to</b> <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> legislation, Congress and the states added additional protections to the Constitution: the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) defining citizenship and mandating equal protection under the law, and the Fifteenth Amendment (1870) banning racial voting restrictions.|$|E

5|$|The CLB {{directors}} concurred, and on January 19, 1920, {{they formed}} an organization {{under a new}} name, the American Civil Liberties Union. Although {{a handful of other}} organizations in the United States at that time focused on civil rights, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the ACLU was the first that did not represent a particular group of persons, or a single theme. Like the CLB, the NAACP pursued litigation to work on civil rights, including efforts <b>to</b> <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> disfranchisement of African Americans in the South that had taken place {{since the turn of the}} century.|$|E
5|$|The barons {{anticipated}} that the King would act in accordance with these charters, subject to the law and moderated by {{the advice of the}} nobility. Uncertainty continued, and in 1227, when he was declared of age and able to rule independently, Henry announced that future charters had to be issued under his own seal. This brought into question the validity of the previous charters issued during his minority, and Henry actively threatened <b>to</b> <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> Charter of the Forest unless the taxes promised in return for it were actually paid. In 1253, Henry confirmed the charters once again in exchange for taxation.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from their}} blue colour, the mythical creatures {{look much like}} humans, and {{are about the same}} size. They have the power to create storms, but when the weather is fine they float {{sleeping}} on or just {{below the surface of the}} water. The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt <b>to</b> <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> ship and capsize it.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} the law was nullified in 1997 by the federal Parliament of Australia which passed the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997. The Act {{continues}} on the Territory's statute books.

50|$|In 2006 a Heritage Lottery Fund {{grant was}} {{obtained}} by Bristol City Council <b>to</b> help <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> decline in economic activity and environmental quality and a rise in social problems seen in the area since the 1970s.|$|R
5|$|As the {{population}} of the territory grew, so did the people's exercising of their freedoms. In 1809, the territory was granted permission to fully elect its own legislature for the first time. Before that, Governor Harrison appointed the legislature. Although Article 6 of the Northwest Ordinance had prohibited slavery, it had existed in the region since French rule. In addition, settlers from the Upper South occupied areas along the Ohio River, bringing slaves with them. They wanted to have it be legal in the territory, but others from the northern states opposed the expansion of slavery into this region. The anti-slavery party won a strong majority in the first election. Governor Harrison was at odds with the new legislature, which proceeded <b>to</b> <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> indenturing and pro-slavery laws he had enacted. Slavery remained the defining issue in the state for the decades to follow. In these early decades, although the legislature did not encourage free blacks to settle here, it extended suffrage to them.|$|E
5|$|George {{was active}} in {{directing}} British foreign policy during his early reign. In 1717 he contributed {{to the creation of}} the Triple Alliance, an anti-Spanish league composed of Great Britain, France and the United Provinces. In 1718 the Holy Roman Empire was added to the body which became known as the Quadruple Alliance. The subsequent War of the Quadruple Alliance involved the same issue as the War of the Spanish Succession. The Treaty of Utrecht (1713) had recognised the grandson of King Louis XIV of France, Philip, as the King of Spain on the condition that he gave up his rights to succeed to the French throne. Upon the death of Louis XIV in 1715, however, Philip sought <b>to</b> <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> treaty.|$|E
5|$|Gov. Schwarzenegger again {{appealed to}} the Supreme Court, looking <b>to</b> <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> Ninth Circuit's ruling, filing a writ of certiorari to the Court in May 2009. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, at this point filed as Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n. The fact that the Court {{accepted}} this case was considered surprising, based on the previous case record for such violent video game laws that were unanimously overturned in other states. Analysts believe that because the Court agreed to hear this case, there are unanswered questions between the protection of free speech from the First Amendment, and the legal enforcement of protecting minors from unprotected free speech such as through restrictions on the sales of pornography to minors. Just a week prior to {{the acceptance of the}} certiorari, in United States v. Stevens the Court overturned another law that sought restrictions on depictions of animal cruelty, which some analysts felt would reflect the Court's position to likely overturn the violent video game law.|$|E

5|$|His {{trial for}} {{obstruction}} of justice was to have begun on March 2, 2009, but jury selection was postponed by 11th-hour appeals by the prosecution. The trial commenced on March 21, 2011, in U. S. District Court, Northern District of California, with Judge Susan Illston presiding. He was convicted on April 13, 2011 on the {{obstruction of justice}} charge, for giving an evasive {{answer to a question}} under oath. His sentence did not include prison. The conviction was initially upheld by a three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 2013, but a larger panel of the court voted 10-1 <b>to</b> <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> conviction on April 22, 2015.|$|E
5|$|However, the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board {{withheld}} its {{permit approval}} in December 2000, over {{concerns that the}} Sweetwater Reservoir could be polluted in the process. Such an approval was necessary under the Clean Water Act {{in order to get}} the necessary approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The suit by Preserve South Bay was dismissed in March 2001, on the grounds that the legislature did not need to review the annexation of state parkland for the highway because it was done under eminent domain. In April, the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board approved the project on several conditions, including monitoring the water quality to ensure that the Sweetwater Reservoir would remain a clean water source for local residents. An appeal to the state Water Resources Control Board <b>to</b> <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> approval was unsuccessful. In July, the USACE approved the wetlands permit for the southern portion of SR 125.|$|E
5|$|Justice David Souter wrote a dissenting opinion, {{which was}} joined by Justice Antonin Scalia. Souter {{referenced}} prior cases dealing with sovereignty and jurisdiction, from the decision made in United States v. Kagama, to the opinion made in South Dakota v. Bourland. Souter stated that the decision in this case did not align with precedent established in previous cases. Since Duro held that the tribes had lost their inherent sovereignty, {{the only way for}} the tribes to regain jurisdiction over non-member Indians would be by the delegation of that jurisdiction by Congress. Bourland was even more specific as to that point. Souter believed that the only two ways that the tribes could regain their sovereignty would be for Congress to declare that they were independent of the United States, as it did with the Philippines, or for the Court <b>to</b> <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> concept of a dependent domestic sovereign.|$|E
