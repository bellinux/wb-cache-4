25|$|In recent years, {{the rocket}} pack has become popular among enthusiasts, {{and some have}} built them for themselves. The pack's basic {{construction}} is rather simple, but its flying capability depends on two key parts: <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator,</b> and the thrust control valve. The rocket packs being built today are largely based on the research and inventions of Wendell Moore at Bell Helicopter.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the Egrett, {{which was}} {{powered by a}} single {{turboprop}} engine, the Strato was powered by two wing-mounted pusher compound engines consisting of a turbocharged piston engine with <b>the</b> <b>Gas</b> <b>Generator</b> from a PW127 turboprop engine to provide a constant supply of pressurised air to the piston engine at high altitude. This {{had the advantage of}} maintaining power at high altitudes. Each engine drove a 6m (19ft 8in) diameter five-bladed propeller.|$|E

2500|$|It can {{be easily}} transported by road. The missile, encased in a canister, is mounted on a single vehicle, which has only a driver's cabin, and the vehicle itself is the launch platform. This [...] "single vehicle solution" [...] reduces its {{signature}} – it cannot be easily detected by satellites – and makes its deployment easy. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator,</b> located {{at the bottom of}} the canister produces high pressure gas, which expands and ejects the missile from the tube.|$|E
2500|$|The Shaurya missile (...) is a canister-launched {{hypersonic}} surface-to-surface tactical missile {{developed by}} the Indian Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) {{for use by the}} Indian Armed Forces. Similar to the BrahMos, Shaurya is stored in composite canisters, which makes it much easier to store for long periods without maintenance as well as to handle and transport. It also houses <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> to eject the missile from the canister before its solid propellant motors take over to hurl it at the intended target.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the Bristol Engine Company’s {{major effort}} was the {{development}} of the Hercules and Centaurus radial piston engines. By the end of 1946, the company had only 10 hours of turbojet experience with a small experimental engine called the Phoebus which was <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> or core of the Proteus turboprop then in development. In early 1947, the parent Bristol Aeroplane Company submitted a proposal for a medium-range bomber to the same specification B.35/46 which led to the Avro Vulcan and Handley Page Victor. The Bristol design was the Type 172 and was to be powered by four or six Bristol engines of [...] thrust to the Ministry engine specification TE.1/46.|$|E

5000|$|Seillean {{is powered}} by a hybrid system of three Ruston gas turbine of 3.3 MW each, and three MAN diesel driven {{generators}} 4.2 MW each. [...] These are operated such that when fuel gas is available from production operations, <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> turbine <b>generators</b> generate electrical power. When fuel <b>gas</b> is unavailable, <b>the</b> diesel driven generators provide the power, supplemented by <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> turbine driven <b>generators</b> operating on diesel oil.|$|R
50|$|A {{turboshaft}} engine {{may be made}} up of two major parts assemblies: the 'gas generator' and the 'power section'. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> consists of the compressor, combustion chambers with ignitors and fuel nozzles, and one or more stages of turbine. The power section consists of additional stages of turbines, a gear reduction system, and the shaft output. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> creates the hot expanding gases to drive the power section. Depending on the design, the engine accessories may be driven either by <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> or by the power section.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> {{control valve}} was a {{pneumatically}} operated poppet-type that was spring-loaded to the closed position. The fuel and oxidizer poppets were mechanically linked by an actuator. The valve controlled {{the flow of}} propellants through <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> injector. When the mainstage signal was received, pneumatic pressure was applied against <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> control valve actuator assembly which moved the piston and opened the fuel poppet. During the fuel poppet opening, an actuator contacted the piston that opened the oxidizer poppet. As the opening pneumatic pressure decayed, spring loads closed the poppets.|$|E
5000|$|During transition, fuel to <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> was not reduced, {{as in the}} Griffon 02 {{when the}} {{external}} flow was burning, but thrust available from <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> automatically decreased {{as a consequence of}} operating at a fixed turbine temperature limit and with increasing compressor inlet temperature. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> RPM was kept at 100% to maintain maximum thrust. The transition to partial ramjet operation may be viewed as complete when, at cruise, the exhaust gas from <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> had no residual energy left for thrust production and all the engine thrust came from the afterburner. The afterburner may be viewed as a ramjet combustor with energy transfer from the turbine exhaust gas. In this characterization as a partial-ramjet the ram air burned in the combustor was about 8% of the turbine exhaust that was reheated (most of the 20% ram air was used for cooling [...] ). The airflow through the intake was being induced, or pumped, by <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> and heated with maximum afterburner, which gave a thrust distribution, at Mach 3+, of 54% inlet, 17.6% engine, 28.4% propelling nozzle.|$|E
6000|$|Before Bert {{could decide}} to say {{anything}} more he was whisked up by the two soldiers. They joined hands to seat him, and his arms were put about their necks. [...] "Vorwarts!"

A structural design, including thermal and stress analysis, and two <b>gas</b> <b>generators</b> were fabricated based on the results. Conclusions are presented...|$|R
50|$|As <b>the</b> name suggests, <b>gas</b> {{turbine engine}} {{compressors}} provide the compression part of <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> turbine engine thermodynamic cycle. There are three basic categories of {{gas turbine engine}} compressor: axial compressor, centrifugal compressor and mixed flow compressor. A fourth, unusual, type is <b>the</b> free-piston <b>gas</b> <b>generator,</b> which combines <b>the</b> functions of compressor and combustion chamber in one unit.|$|R
50|$|The Ardiden 1H series engines have a radial {{air intake}} and a {{two-stage}} centrifugal compressor {{driven by a}} single stage axial gas generator turbine. Airflow is directed through a reverse flow annular combustion chamber, through <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> turbine and then through and a two-stage axial free power turbine. Output power is transmitted to a front-mounted reduction gearbox by a shaft concentrically mounted within <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> rotor assembly. The accessory gearbox, also mounted at the front end, is driven by <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator.</b> Control is {{by means of a}} dual-channel digital engine electronic control unit (DECU).|$|E
50|$|Thrust is {{controlled}} by a valve which varies the throat area of <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> nozzle. Reducing the throat area increases the pressure in <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> which increases the propellant burn rate, increasing the fuel mass flow into the ramcombustor. The mass flow can be varied continuously over a ratio greater than 10:1.|$|E

50|$|Related {{services}} and {{technology can be}} supplied such as vacuum, which is often provided in hospital gas systems; purified compressed air; or refrigeration. Another unusual system is <b>the</b> inert <b>gas</b> <b>generator.</b> Some industrial <b>gas</b> companies may also supply related chemicals, particularly liquids such as bromine and ethylene oxide.|$|R
50|$|The {{sustainer}} malfunction on Missile 26E {{had been}} {{traced to a}} <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> failure which occurred during the staging sequence, but the exact reason for it was unclear, {{in part because of}} the normal momentary telemetry blackout that occurred at booster jettison due to ionized engine exhaust <b>gases</b> impinging on <b>the</b> telemetry antenna. When telemetry returned, <b>the</b> sustainer <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> temperature was over 1000°F (537°C), suggesting a LOX-rich shutdown.|$|R
5000|$|W. Hryniszak of Asea Brown Boveri in Heidelberg {{designed}} a recuperator that {{was added to}} the otherwise unmodified GT 102 design to produce the GT 103. The heat exchanger used a rotating porous ceramic cylinder fit into a cruciform duct. Air from <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator's</b> exhaust entered <b>the</b> duct outside the cylinder at 500 °C, and blew around the cylinder, heating it and then exhausting at about 350 C. The ceramic cylinder rotated slowly in order to avoid overheating the [...] "hot" [...] side. Compressed air flowing into the power turbine was piped through the middle of the cylinder, entering at about 180 C and exiting at about 300 C.|$|R

5000|$|N1 or Ng {{refers to}} the RPM of <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> section. Each engine {{manufacturer}} will pick between those two abbreviation. N1 is also used for the fan speed on a turbofan, in which case N2 is <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> speed (2 shaft engine). Ng is mainly used for turboprop or turboshaft engines. For example, a common Ng {{would be on the}} order of 30,000 RPM.|$|E
50|$|Turboshaft {{engines are}} often used to drive {{compression}} trains (for example in gas pumping stations or natural gas liquefaction plants) and are used to power almost all modern helicopters. The primary shaft bears the compressor and the high speed turbine (often referred to as <b>the</b> <b>Gas</b> <b>Generator),</b> while a second shaft bears the low-speed turbine (a power turbine or free-wheeling turbine on helicopters, especially, because <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> turbine spins separately from the power turbine). In effect the separation of <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>generator,</b> by a fluid coupling (the hot energy-rich combustion gases), from the power turbine is analogous to an automotive transmission's fluid coupling. This arrangement is used to increase power-output flexibility with associated highly-reliable control mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|The {{power plant}} {{consists}} of multiple-shaft combined cycle unit with one steam turbine-generator, three <b>gas</b> turbine <b>generators</b> and three heat recovery steam generators, designed for natural <b>gas</b> firing. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> turbine <b>generators</b> came fromm General Electric with F-class technology and was shipped in 2002. Each has 18-stage axial compressor and 3-stage turbine. It {{also features a}} cold-end drive and axial exhaust.|$|R
50|$|Gas tankers {{and product}} {{carriers}} cannot rely on flue gas systems (because they require IG with O2 content of 1% or less) and so use inert <b>gas</b> <b>generators</b> instead. <b>The</b> inert <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> {{consists of a}} combustion chamber and scrubber unit supplied by fans and a refrigeration unit which cools <b>the</b> <b>gas.</b> A drier in series with the system removes moisture from <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> before it is supplied to the deck. Cargo tanks on gas carriers are not inerted, but the hold space around them is. This arrangement allows the tanks to be kept cool using a small heel of cargo while the vessel is in ballast while retaining the explosion protection provided by <b>the</b> inert <b>gas.</b>|$|R
