The judges explain the rules of evidence and procedure to the parties. They direct the proceedings, question witnesses, hear the parties, and decide the issues in dispute. They provide each party with fair and impartial assistance, so as to render the substantive law effective and ensure that it is carried out. Where circumstances allow, the judges endeavour to bring the parties to an agreement. When judgment is rendered, it is a reasoned decision and cannot be appealed. Judges in this division also decide tax-related summary appeals.|$|E
50|$|DHS {{partnered with}} the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University {{to create the}} EDM Assessment. The {{assessment}} itself consists of 71 questions about specific practices. Questions in the EDM Assessment are drawn from the Cyber Resilience Review {{as well as the}} CERT Resilience Management Model. In addition, the authors used concepts from the Information Technology Infrastructure Library and National Institute of Standards and Technology materials. Each question in the EDM Assessment is scored in one of three ways, yes, no, or incomplete. A “yes” means that the practice is fully performed as described in the assessment. “No” means that the practice is not performed at all in the organization. An “incomplete” means that the practice is partially performed. For example, if the question asks “Does the organization have a documented procedure for entering into formal agreements with third parties?”, an answer of “incomplete” could mean that <b>the</b> <b>written</b> <b>procedure</b> is incomplete or being written.|$|E

At any stage of the proceedings, it may also order provisional measures or attempt to facilitate an amicable resolution based on respect for human rights.|$|E

30|$|The {{presence}} of a written procedure {{does not mean that}} physicians will follow it. We found that the {{presence of}} a written procedure on sedation management did not reduce the practice variation. One of the underlying reasons might be the lack of knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>written</b> <b>procedure.</b> Indeed, we found that among ICUs self-reporting a protocol for sedation management, approximately 20 % of the physicians were unaware of it. Hence, the presence of written procedures does not mean that there is an ICU culture promoting the benefits of written procedures to reduce practice variation within participating ICUs. Sinuff et al. showed in a multicenter qualitative study that the {{presence of a}} culture of guidelines within the ICU is key to facilitate clinicians’ adherence to guidelines [19]. Another explanation may be that written procedures apply poorly to complex situations and are rapidly judged useless when addressing complex issues.|$|E

Frameworks were developed to show how these factors interacted to explain the two types of accuracy in mental addition and subtraction. Flexible accuracy was related to the presence of strong number sense knowledge integrated with metacognitive strategies and beliefs and beliefs about self and teaching; while inflexible accuracy was a result of compensation of inadequate knowledge supported by beliefs about self and teaching...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study of seven Year 3 {{students}} ’ diminished performance in addition and subtraction mental computation. Although all students were identified as being inaccurate, three students used some variety of mental strategies, while the other students used only one strategy that reflected <b>the</b> <b>written</b> <b>procedure</b> {{for each of the}} addition and subtraction algorithms taught in the classroom. Interviews were used to identify students’ knowledge and ability with respect to number sense (including numeration, number and operations, basic facts, estimation), metacognition, affects, and memory. Two conceptual frameworks were developed, one representing the flexible mental computers, and the other representing the inflexible mental computers. These frameworks identified factors and relationships between factors that influence flexibility in these inaccurate mental computers. The frameworks were compared with a framework of an ideal mental computer. These frameworks showed that inaccuracy resulted from disconnected and deficient cognitive, metacognitive, and affective factors; and in some cases might have been affected by deficient short-term memory. It appeared that students ’ choices of mental strategies resulted from different forms of compensation for varying levels of deficiencies...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThree-dimensional {{structuring}} of bulk dielectric materials {{usually requires}} focusing through air-dielectric interfaces. Consequently, depth-dependent spherical aberration appears. This determines an elongation {{of the energy}} deposition area and restricts the structuring accuracy. We discuss here strategies for counteracting wavefront distortion effects which occur during ultrafast laser induced changes of refractive index. The proposed approaches are based on programmable spatio-temporal pulse shaping and {{have the objective of}} concentrating the laser energy on minimal spatial scales. Using adaptive spatial tailoring of ultrashort laser pulses, spherical aberrations can be dynamically corrected, in synchronization with <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>procedure.</b> This facilitates optimal writing of homo-geneous longitudinal waveguides over significant lengths. We also show that temporal forming of ultrafast laser pulses restricts the energy spread, leading to a higher confinement. We indicate the role of reduced nonlinearity in plasma formation as a control factor coupling the spatial and tempo-ral response of the material. The size corrections enable higher processing accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. When {{flash memory}} {{is used as}} a storage in {{embedded}} systems, block level translation layer is required between conventional filesystem and flash memory chips due to its physical characteristics. A far more efficient use of it is the design of a filesystem itself without no extra layer of translation. However, since flash filesystem does not use block device layer, it cannot utilize deferred I/O although deferred I/O enhances write latency by delaying the flushing jobs. Linux operating system generally uses <b>the</b> <b>write</b> back routine for deferred I/O using kernel thread, which writes back dirty pages and buffers through the block device layer. In this paper, we design and implement efficient I/O for JFFS 2 flash filesystem based on flash memory. For this, we first analyze <b>the</b> <b>write</b> <b>procedure</b> of JFFS 2 filesystem in detail, and derive the drawback and overhead. Then, we design <b>the</b> flash <b>write</b> back routine for deferred I/O. We apply it to the Linux JFFS 2 by implementing fflush and flash writeback kernel thread. <b>The</b> designed flash <b>write</b> back routine can reduce average <b>write</b> latency when <b>the</b> kernel buffers are enough to get the users data. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of Diderot’s first drama, Le Fils naturel, unleashed a furious counter-offensive from playwrights and from influential sectors of journalistic criticism (Fréron, Palissot, Collé), who were fighting the theories {{closed in the}} armour of standards and of the "good" rule of playwriting. The heated debate that aroused, allows us to bring back to light the underlying terms of a first, bewildered reaction to the Enlightenment critique {{on the principle of}} Autorité dans les discours et dans les écrits.
