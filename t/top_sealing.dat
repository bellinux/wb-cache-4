40|$|Sequestration {{of carbon}} dioxide (CO 2) into {{subsurface}} porous sandstone is proposed as a method for reducing accumulation of anthropogenic emissions of CO 2 into the atmosphere. Natural exposures of reservoir and top-seal pairs in central and southeastern Utah are identified as analogs to proposed CO 2 injection targets. Reservoir and top-seal pairs in natural analog exposures are analyzed in tandem to evaluate evidence for paleo-migration of fluids and/or hydrocarbons from the reservoir through the top seal. The San Rafael Swell and Monument Uplift exhibit similar structure and exposures of Jurassic units yet differ in amount and type of host rock alteration due to variable amounts and types of fluids and/or hydrocarbons that migrated along faults and fractures. Macroscopic scale analysis of each monocline included processing of satellite imagery, and creation of depth contour maps. At the mesoscopic scale, fracture spacing acquired from scanline station measurements identified increased fracture frequency in proximity to major fault zones. At the microscopic scale, percentage of degradation and type of mineralization in pore space were used to verify increased fluid flow in proximity to major fault zones. Faults with possible intersections with multiple antithetic faults at depth have an increased probability of allowing for upward migration of fluids and/or hydrocarbons along the fault plane and damage zone, effectively bypassing the <b>top</b> <b>sealing</b> formations. Fault leakage potential maps identified areas where seal bypass along major faults would likely occur during sequestration of CO 2. The method was validated by identifying potential migration pathways for oil seeps on the Little Grand Wash fault in central Utah. The San Rafael Swell was geometrically modeled through restoration of eroded formation tops along the fold axis to quantify the interaction between an outward migrating CO 2 plume and varying degrees of faulting and fracturing. Analysis of the migration of a CO 2 plume front through time exhibits an increasing probability of the outward migrating plume intersecting a leaking feature, with the highest probability of the advancing plume intersecting a potentially leaking feature achieved when faults with 1 + km trace length and mean fracture spacing of 17 cm are taken into consideration.

40|$|Fault and <b>top</b> <b>seal</b> {{effectiveness}} {{has proved}} to be a significant risk in exploration success, and creates a large uncertainty in predicting reservoir performance. This is particularly true in the Australian context, but equally applies to exploration provinces worldwide. Seals can be broadly classified into fault, intraformational, and <b>top</b> <b>seal.</b> For geological time-scale processes, intraformational and <b>top</b> <b>seals</b> are typically characterised by their membrane seal capacity and fracture threshold pressure. Fault seals are typically characterised by fault geometry, juxtaposition, membrane seal capacity, and reactivation potential. At the production time scale, subtle variations in the permeability distribution within a reservoir can lead to compartmentalization. These are typically characterised by dynamic reservoir models which assume hydrostatic conditions prior to commencement of production. There are few references in the seals literature concerning the integration of hydrodynamic techniques with the various aspects of seal evaluation. The research for this PhD thesis by published papers includes: Methodology for characterising formation water flow systems in faulted strata at exploration and production time scales; a new theory of hydrodynamics and membrane (capillary) seal capacity; and case study evaluations demonstrating integrated multidisciplinary techniques for the evaluation of seal capacity (fault, intraformational and <b>top</b> <b>seal)</b> that demonstrate the new theory in practice. By incorporating hydrodynamic processes in the evaluation of total seal capacity, the evidence shows that existing shale gouge ratio – across fault pressure difference (SGR-AFPD) calibration plots need adjustment resulting in the calibration envelopes shifting to the centre of the plot. This adjustment sharpens the predictive capacity for membrane seal analysis in the pre-drill scenario.

The result of the thesis is a new theory and approach to characterising membrane seal capacity for the total seal thickness, and has implications for an adjusted SGR-AFPD calibration to be applied in pre-drill evaluations of seal capacity.

30|$|Favorable <b>top</b> {{and bottom}} <b>sealing</b> {{conditions}} are also {{critical for the}} enrichment of continuous hydrocarbon accumulation. As far as the accumulations of shale oil/gas or CBM are concerned, the premise of their enrichment is that the hydrocarbons generated in organic-rich shales or coals were not completely expelled. The less hydrocarbons that are expelled, the more hydrocarbons are retained in the source rocks, and the more abundant the accumulated shale oil/gas and CBM. The quantity of hydrocarbons trapped within source rocks is not simply affected {{by the quality of}} source rocks per se, but also by the sealing conditions or the conditions of hydrocarbon expulsion. The conditions of sealing and expulsion of source rocks depend on the following three major factors. The first is the thickness of source rocks; the greater the thickness, the more difficult it is for the hydrocarbon to be expelled and the more hydrocarbons that are retained. The second is the <b>top</b> and bottom <b>sealing</b> conditions, as more hydrocarbons would be held in source rocks with effective <b>top</b> and bottom <b>seals.</b> The third is the intensity of tectonic activities, as strong tectonic activities can lead to the development of more fractures, and thus conditions would become more favorable for hydrocarbon expulsion from source rocks and less favorable for hydrocarbon accumulation within them. As a consequence, source rocks with sufficiently great thickness and good quality, and propitious <b>top</b> and bottom <b>sealing</b> conditions, but moderately developed fractures, are advantageous for shale oil/gas and CBM enrichment. The major gas-rich shales in North America are exactly those possessing good to excellent <b>top</b> and bottom <b>sealing</b> conditions. For instance, the Barnett Shale in the Fort Worth Basin and the Devonian–Carboniferous New Albany Shale in the Illinois Basin have tight limestones acting as both top and bottom seals; for the Devonian Marcellus Shale in the Appalachia Basin and the Devonian Antrim Shale in the Michigan Basin, the <b>top</b> <b>seals</b> are shales, while the bottom seals are limestones; the <b>top</b> <b>seal</b> of the Devonian Woodford Shale in the Acoma Basin is comprised of limestones, while the bottom seal consists of sandstones/limestones; the Upper Jurassic Haynesville Shale in the East Texas–North Louisiana Basin is overlain by sandstones and underlain by limestones, whereas the Carboniferous Fayetteville Shale in the Acoma Basin is overlain by a limestone interval and underlain by a sandstone formation (Ground Water Protection Council 2009).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Mudrocks are {{effective}} <b>top</b> <b>seals</b> for hydrocarbon accumulations because they possess very low permeabilities, high capillary entry pressures, {{and are often}} laterally con-tinuous basin-wide. For leakage through the seal to take place, an additional mechanism must provide nhanced permeability in mudrocks. Tectonically induced, dilatant faulting and fracturing in brittle rocks is such a mechanism. The effectiveness of mudrocks as seals may be compromised {{by a number of}} other factors, such as tectonic fault displacements in excess of the seal thickness; tensile fracturing under extreme fluid pressure conditions; and leakage via a network of juxtaposed thin leaky beds across sub-seismic faults within the seal. Before hydrocarbon trap integrity analysis, seismic interpretations should honour the fundamental geometry of the trap as closely as possible because <b>top</b> <b>seals</b> can be reliably appraised only when basic geometries are accurately determined. Fluid pressure is a proven risk in many exploration provinces, in terms of mudrock top-seal leakage via opening mode fractures. This natural hydrofracturing can take place if buoyancy pressures, combined with fluid overpressures, exceed the minimum in situ horizontal stress, plus the tensile strength of the seal, an occurrence that leads to mechanical failure of the seal rock.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Analysis of the Muderong Shale {{from the}} Carnarvon Basin {{suggests}} the shale {{is dominated by}} interstratified illite–smectite with {{a high percentage of}} illite interlayers. Capillary pressure measurements indicate that gas columns of c. 250 m could be sealed by such shale, although the choice of drying method used does influence the accuracy of this calculation. Freeze drying yielded the most consistent threshold pressure results, whereas air drying and vacuum drying showed a greater range of values. Similar calculations in regard to carbon dioxide sequestration indicate column heights of between 550 m and 750 m could be retained. Column height variation is primarily dependent on the contact angle of supercritical carbon dioxide with shale. Microstructurally, the shale is clay supported, exhibiting differ-ential compaction of clays around more rigid grains and containing numerous high aspect ratio discontinuous fractures. These fractures do not affect the capillary properties of the shale, even when injection is fracture-parallel, suggesting they are unlikely to influence reservoir-scale fluid-flow properties. Comparison of the Muderong Shale laboratory data with hydrocarbon column heights from Carnarvon Basin discoveries indicate that <b>top</b> <b>seal</b> failure by capillary breakthrough is unlikely given the maximum lengths of hydrocarbon columns encountered to date.

40|$|The Bunter Sandstone Formation (BSF) in the UK {{sector of}} the Southern North Sea {{is thought to have}} a {{significant}} potential for the injection and storage of anthropogenic CO 2 within periclines that lie above salt domes and pillows formed by halokinesis in underlying Zechstein strata. During the formation of the periclines, the BSF and its overlying <b>top</b> <b>seals</b> were subjected to extensional stresses and, in consequence, are commonly cut by seismically resolvable faults that present a risk to the containment of gas and buoyant fluids such as supercritical CO 2. Although most of the closed structures in the BSF are saline water-bearing, eight gas fields (total gas initially-in-place > 72 bcm (billion cubic metres)) have been discovered to date. The seismically resolved structure of these gas fields demonstrates that two different <b>top</b> <b>seals,</b> the Haisborough Group and the Speeton Clay, can seal gas columns of up to 128 and 104 m respectively, despite the presence of faults with small displacements above the field gas–water contacts. The observed gas columns are equivalent to CO 2 columns of up to around 100 m in height. Simple geomechanical modelling suggests that existing optimally orientated faults may dilate or be reactivated if the pore-fluid pressure increase as a result of CO 2 injection exceeds a gradient of about 13. 4 MPa km– 1, potentially resulting in loss of storage integrity. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of palaeo-oil columns in Late Jurassic and Cretaceous reservoirs in the Vulcan sub-basin indicates that hydrocarbon accumulations have leaked. It {{is unclear whether}} accumulations have leaked through breach of <b>top</b> <b>seal</b> or fault seal. This study evaluates the <b>top</b> <b>seal</b> potential for hydrocarbon accumulations in the Vulcan Sub-basin. For this purpose a <b>top</b> <b>seal</b> potential assessment methodology was developed. Seal potential (SP) combines seal capacity (the hydrocarbon column height that can physically be held back by seal), seal geometry (the areal extent and thickness of the seal) and seal integrity (rock mechanical properties of the seal). Seal capacities are measured using mercury injection capillary pressure calculations. Areal extent is evaluated using sedimentological and sequence stratigraphic principles. Thickness is determined empirically from well logs and seismic data. Seal integrity is derived from a brittleness index. In addition, a component relating to data quality and quantity is included in seal potential evaluation. The main sample set for this study is composed of drill cuttings. For this reason a comparison of seal capacity results measured from cuttings and cores has verified that cuttings samples provide accurate seal capacity measurements. Lower Vulcan Formation SP ranges from low to high due to variations in seal capacity and thickness risks as well as data quality and quantity. High SP occurs in the main depocentres and low SP occurs on the palaeo-highs and basin margins. Upper Vulcan Formations SP ranges from low to moderate due to variations in seal capacity. Moderate SP occurs in the depocentres and low SP on the basin margins. In the Echuca Shoals Formations seal capacity. Formation seal extent and integrity as well as data quality and quantity are good. However seal thickness is inconsistent, resulting in SP variations from good to poor {{as a function of}} thickness. Jamieson Formation has high seal capacities, is thick and areally extensive, however the seal potential is locally moderate (for example on the Ashmore Platform) due to seal integrity risk. SP for the Jamieson is controlled by the thickness and the amount of calcite present in the rock, which affects the brittleness of the formation and hence the seal integrity. The Woolaston, Gibson and Fenelon (WGF) Formations are grouped together as a regional seal and in this group SP varies from low to high. The WGF rocks generally have high seal capacities, are areally extensive and thick with good data quality and quantity sample set wise. Where the WGF is predominantly marl and calcilutite some of the highest brittleness index values were recorded and hence the WGF has a low SP in these areas. Based on the overall seal potential analysis, almost all seals in the area are capable of holding back hydrocarbon columns greater then present or palaeocolums recorded. This suggests that hydrocarbon leakage in the Vulcan Sub-Basin did not occur as a result of <b>top</b> <b>seal</b> capillary failure. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The petrophysical {{properties}} of cap rocks and intraformational barriers can constrain {{the carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) containment volumes of potential geosequestration sites. Characterisation of regional seals and intraformational barriers requires {{an understanding of the}} seal capacity of the cap rock or barrier. Seal capacity is the capillary pressure (or column height) at which a trapped fl uid commences to leak through a seal rock. Seal rocks are effective due to very fi ne pore and pore-throat sizes that result in low porosities and permeabilities. These in turn generate high capillary threshold pressures. High threshold pressures, together with wettability and interfacial tension (IFT) properties determine the fi nal column height that a seal can hold. Wettability and IFT {{play an important role in}} the geological storage of CO 2 through their effect on seal capacity (CO 2 column height) with respect to capillary pressure, thereby controlling the potential for the movement of CO 2 through the seal and affecting ultimate reservoir storage volumes. Mercury injection capillary pressure analysis has been used extensively in the petroleum industry to determine the effectiveness of the <b>top</b> <b>seal</b> in relation to hydrocarbon column height retention. With the burgeoning interest in geological storage of CO 2, this technology can be applied to establish the suitability of a <b>top</b> <b>seal</b> for containment of CO 2; however, the role of IFT and wettability in the CO 2 -water-rock systems is not well understood.

40|$|AbstractA {{framework}} for certifying and decommissioning CO 2 geologic sequestration sites {{is a critical}} requirement for large-scale deployment of CO 2 sequestration in brine formations. The certification process should account for the sequestration efficiency of a given volume of a saline aquifer. The sequestration efficiency is determined by maximizing CO 2 trapping while minimizing the leakage risk. As part {{of the development of}} the Certification Framework, we carried out a large number of compositional simulations to quantify the effect of various reservoir and operating parameters. Porosity, horizontal permeability, permeability anisotropy, formation thickness and dip, pressure, and temperature were systematically varied. Operating parameters such as injection rate, vertical vs. horizontal well and perforation interval were investigated. We then developed several simplified models of CO 2 plume behaviour and verified them against sophisticated reservoir simulations. The simple models captured the following trends: leakage potential increases (1) as the time for the CO 2 plume to reach the <b>top</b> <b>seal</b> of the aquifer decreases; (2) as the lateral distance travelled by the plume increases, and (3) as total mobile CO 2 increases. We studied one risk parameter in detail, the time for the CO 2 plume to reach the aquifer <b>top</b> <b>seal,</b> and showed that it varies systematically with gravity number, defined as the ratio of gravity forces to viscous forces. Likely behaviour of an actual saline aquifer relative to that one risk parameter is easily captured by interpolation within the catalogue of detailed simulations for different reservoir and operational parameters.

40|$|Analysis of leaky CO 2 {{reservoirs}} in {{the northern}} Paradox Basin, Utah has allowed us to develop {{a model for the}} shallow subsurface CO 2 flow system. The results provide information on how CO 2 migrates and reacts with groundwater and reservoir rocks in the subsurface, and what the effects on surface environments are when CO 2 leaks to the surface. A series of shallow fluvial and eolian sandstone groundwater reservoirs are charged with CO 2 derived mostly from clay-carbonate reactions in Paleozoic source rocks within the basin (depths greater than 1. 5 km). The CO 2 -charged groundwater builds up in a north-plunging anticlinal trap with fault sealing on its southern margin. <b>Top</b> <b>seal</b> is provided by shale-rich formations, but fractures related to the fault damage zone provide conduits through the <b>top</b> <b>seal.</b> This geometry has resulted in a series of stacked reservoirs, and ultimately in escape of the natural CO 2 into the atmosphere. The CO 2 escapes through a series of springs and geysers along the faults, and through wellbores that have penetrated the reservoir. At the surface, rapid degassing of CO 2 -charged groundwater results in the formation of travertine mounds around active springs. The presence of deeply incised ancient mounds attests to the long lifespan of this leaky system. There is no evidence of adverse effects of this leakage on wildlife or humans, and the springs provide (somewhat saline) water for plants in this high desert environment. Studies on the effect of long-term leakage both in the subsurface and at the point of leakage to the surface provide data on factors that affect the safety and feasibility of future CO 2 injection projects and should guide the design and implementation of geologic storage projects...|$|R
