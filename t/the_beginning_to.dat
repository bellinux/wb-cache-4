5|$|Ten Dollar Bill (also {{referred}} to as The Dollar Bill) is a 1956 proto-pop art lithographic drawing by Roy Lichtenstein. Considered to {{be a combination of}} Americana art and cubism, the work is {{referred to}} as <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> Lichtenstein's work on pop art. Twenty-five editions of the lithograph were made by Lichtenstein, which were exhibited at several galleries. The piece is based on the design for the ten-dollar bill and has influenced several of Lichtenstein's later works. The picture has received generally favorable reception from critics, and is considered {{to be one of the}} best artistic portrayals of currency.|$|E
5|$|The film grossed 200 {{million on}} its second {{day at the}} global box office, taking its two-day global total gross to 500 million. With this, it became the second-fastest Telugu film of the year after Baahubali: <b>The</b> <b>Beginning</b> <b>to</b> do so. The film managed to collect a total net of 330 million and a {{distributor}} share of 200 million in two days at the global box office. The film grossed 250 million on its third day, taking its three-day global total gross to 750 million, thus breaking the records set by Telugu films other than Baahubali: The Beginning. The film grossed a total of 1.0125 billion in its first week at the global box office.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} type of Mycenaean helmet is the conical one {{reinforced}} with rows of boar tusks. This type was widely used and became the most identifiable piece of Mycenaean armor, being in use from <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> the collapse of Mycenaean culture. It is also known from several depictions in contemporary art in Greece and the Mediterranean. Boar's tusk helmets consisted of a felt-lined leather cap, with several rows of cut boar's tusk sewn onto it.|$|E

5|$|The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Men's Division I Basketball Championship, or NCAA Tournament, is a single-elimination {{tournament for}} men's college {{basketball}} {{teams in the}} United States. It determines the champion of Division I, the top level of play in the NCAA, and the media often describes the winner as the national champion of college basketball. The NCAA Tournament has been held annually since 1939, and its field grew from eight teams in <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> sixty-five teams by 2001; as of 2011, sixty-eight teams {{take part in the}} tournament. Teams can gain invitations by winning a conference championship or receiving an at-large bid from a 10-person committee. The semifinals of the tournament are known as the Final Four and are held in a different city each year, along with the championship game; Indianapolis, the city where the NCAA is based, will host the Final Four every five years until 2040. Each winning university receives a rectangular, gold-plated trophy made of wood.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> {{the race}} {{highlighted}} {{the dominance of}} the Kenyan and Ethiopian runners as they set a high tempo from the outset. By the time the first 5km marker was passed, Australia's Nikki Chapple was the only athlete left in the leading pack to come from outside the two historically strong nations. A few kilometres later, she dropped back from the pack and at the 10km mark five Ethiopians and four Kenyans had a fifteen-second advantage {{on the rest of the}} field. As the race reached the midway point, the temperature began to increase and the heat and humidity reduced the pace of the runners. The conditions took their toll on some of the leaders in this section of the race. Chepchirchir slowed considerably while Meseret Mengistu, Joyce Chepkirui and Fate Tola were the next to gradually lose contact with the front runners. Kiplagat, Dire, Arusei and Feyse Tadese were the sole contenders remaining as the race headed towards the final stages, but Kiplagat and Dire soon left the other two trailing a few minutes later.|$|E
5|$|The player {{needs to}} make moral {{decisions}} at certain points during the game, including making choices that can determine the fate of both soldiers and civilians. These decisions affect the relationship between Walker and his squadmates, and will cause them to react differently. The game has several subtle effects as the team starts being broken mentally and physically, including the degradation of their combat uniforms. Walker has visual and auditory hallucinations later into the game, and his executions of enemies become more violent. The orders and shouts to his team become increasingly angry and ragged in contrast to his original stern command voice. His kill confirmations of enemies corrupts from professional in <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> psychotic. Similarly, loading screens initially display helpful gameplay hints for the player, but as the game progresses, the text becomes increasingly hostile towards Walker's actions, and sometimes breaks the fourth wall by addressing the player directly. The game features collectibles known as Intel, which are audio logs that provide additional backstory for players.|$|E
60|$|His advent, {{like that}} of Orpheus in hades, seemed to soothe all unpropitious powers with a sudden spell. <b>The</b> Fire <b>began</b> <b>to</b> slacken, <b>the</b> kettles <b>began</b> <b>to</b> lull, <b>the</b> meat <b>began</b> <b>to</b> cook, <b>the</b> irons <b>began</b> <b>to</b> cool, <b>the</b> clothes <b>began</b> <b>to</b> behave, <b>the</b> spirits <b>began</b> <b>to</b> rise, and <b>the</b> collar was {{finished}} off with most triumphant success. John watched the change, and, though a lord of creation, abased himself to take compassion on the weaker vessel, and was seized with a great desire to lighten the homely tasks that tried her strength of body and soul. He took a comprehensive glance about the room; then, extracting a dish from he closet, proceeded to imbrue {{his hands in the}} strawberries' blood.|$|R

5|$|The player, as Yumetaro, must {{venture into}} the {{alternate}} dimension to rescue his new owner. The player character can jump and spawn stars above the horn on his head. The star is a central mechanic to the game, being necessary to defeat enemies found while also doubling as a platform, capable of being ridden to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. The player must make their way through six stages and six bosses to complete the game. Once the sixth boss is defeated, it is revealed that the girl is still missing and the game restarts from <b>the</b> <b>beginning.</b> <b>To</b> truly complete Gimmick!, the player must find a hidden area in each stage where a magic item resides. If one can obtain each all the magic items without losing every life (i.e. using no continues), a secret stage will appear in which an extra boss must be beaten. Only after this boss is defeated is the game completed in full, with a cutscene showing Yumetaro rescuing the girl and leading {{her back to the}} real world.|$|E

25|$|Steiner's {{belief that}} all people are imbued with a spiritual core has fueled Waldorf schools' social mission.

25|$|Hynek was an {{associate}} {{member of the}} Robertson Panel, which recommended that UFOs needed debunking.

25|$|The Liberal {{government}} {{came close}} to falling when testimony from the Gomery Commission caused public opinion to move sharply against the government. The Bloc Québécois were eager from <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> have an early election. The Conservatives announced they had also lost confidence in the government's moral authority. Thus, during much of spring 2005, there was a widespread belief that the Liberals would lose a confidence vote, prompting an election {{taking place in the}} spring or summer of 2005.|$|E

25|$|Educational {{psychology}} {{is a fairly}} new and growing field of study. Though it can date back {{as early as the}} days of Plato and Aristotle, it was not identified as a specific practice.
