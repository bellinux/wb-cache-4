This line will even have a longer timeframe due to the environmental study aspects, with the completion by 2030. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has also expressed interest in the implementation of possible express services on the CRL in future, apart from having just normal services. This express service would benefit commuters during the morning peak hours as trains would stop at only the interchanges and skip the remaining stations, hence, reducing travel time greatly.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Transfer</b> <b>lines</b> {{are more}} and more {{dedicated}} to producing a variety of similar products allowing some flexibility to this important class of manufacturing systems. For many decades, an important work has been done to evaluate the performance and specifically the capacity of <b>transfer</b> <b>lines.</b> However, most of these works are so far limited to the mono-product and homogeneous <b>transfer</b> <b>lines.</b> This paper analyses the performance of <b>transfer</b> <b>lines</b> composed of several machines with a serial configuration and dedicated to producing a variety of products in a batch production environment. The products are manufactured according to the real stochastic and dynamic demand characterized by random product arrivals and random lot sizing. The considered <b>transfer</b> <b>lines</b> have no intermediate buffers between adjacent machines. Machines have different deterministic processing times and are subject to random operationdependent failures. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose analytical models to assess the steady-state availability and the overall throughput of such lines. A general simulation model was developed and statistical tests were carried out to prove the robustness and the exactness of the proposed analytical models.

Typically, the reaction temperature is very high, at around 850°C, but the reaction is only allowed to take place very briefly. In modern cracking furnaces, the residence time is reduced to milliseconds to improve yield, resulting in gas velocities up to the speed of sound. After the cracking temperature has been reached, the gas is quickly quenched to stop the reaction in a <b>transfer</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger or inside a quenching header using quench oil.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Most of the {{research}} concerning production systems is so far limited to {{the assessment of the}} steady-state throughput despite the impact of the parameter variability on the overall performance of such systems. In this paper, we propose an analytical model to assess the variance of the throughput of homogeneous <b>transfer</b> <b>lines</b> subject to operation-dependant failures. The <b>transfer</b> <b>lines</b> subject of study are composed of a series of manufacturing machines with no intermediate buffers where failure and repair times are exponentially distributed. Based on Markov reward processes, the proposed analytical model determines the limiting variance of the sojourn time in the operational state. A numerical procedure has also been developed to assess the variance of the throughput for <b>transfer</b> <b>lines</b> composed of several machines with different reliability and maintainability characteristics. Numerical examples show that, although the steady-state throughput decreases monotonically, the throughout variance of <b>transfer</b> <b>lines</b> increases and then decreases as the number of manufacturing machines constituting it increases. Compared to past works considering time-dependent failure mode, the results show that in general <b>transfer</b> <b>lines</b> subject to operation-dependant failure mode are superior to those subject to time-dependant failure mode not only in term of the steady-state throughput but also when considering their respective throughput variability.
