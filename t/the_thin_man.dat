5|$|Nat Pendleton, a {{freestyle}} wrestler {{who had won}} {{the silver}} medal at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp and had appeared alongside Powell in <b>The</b> <b>Thin</b> <b>Man</b> (1934), was cast as the circus strongman Eugen Sandow.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Thin</b> <b>Man</b> gun-type {{design was}} at that time based on the fissibility of the very pure plutonium-239 isotope so far only {{produced}} in microgram quantities by the Berkeley cyclotron. When the Hanford production reactors came on-line in early 1944, the mix of plutonium-239 and plutonium-240 obtained was found to have a high rate of spontaneous fission. To avoid pre-detonation, the muzzle velocity of the gun-type design would need to be greatly raised, making it impractically long.|$|E
5|$|Following Oppenheimer's {{reorganization}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory in July 1944, {{the work on the}} uranium gun-type weapon was concentrated in Francis Birch's O-1 (Gun) Group. The concept was pursued so that in case of a failure to develop an implosion bomb, at least the enriched uranium could be used. Henceforth the gun-type had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed <b>the</b> <b>Thin</b> <b>Man</b> design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted, one short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay. The new design was called Little Boy.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapon and the plutonium gun-type fission weapon, the uranium gun-type weapon was straightforward if not trivial to design. The concept was pursued so that {{in case of a}} failure to develop a plutonium bomb, it would still be possible to use the gun principle. The gun-type design henceforth had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed <b>the</b> <b>Thin</b> <b>Man</b> design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted. The simplified weapon was short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{there were}} {{concerns}} about the purity of plutonium, an element about which little was known, but Thomas was able to report to Groves and Conant in June 1944 that techniques had been developed that would yield highly pure plutonium, and that the problem was solved. Unfortunately, experiments by Emilio G. Segr√® and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos on reactor-produced plutonium showed that it contained impurities {{in the form of}} the isotope plutonium-240, which has a far higher spontaneous fission rate than plutonium-239, making it unsuitable for use in <b>the</b> <b>Thin</b> <b>Man</b> gun-type nuclear weapon design.|$|E
5|$|Nicky Flippers {{was not a}} part of {{the story}} as it was {{initially}} conceived and prior to his creation, the investigation was going to be led by Chief Grizzly. After producer Sue Bea Montgomery and her husband pointed out similarities between the film and the 1950s television series <b>The</b> <b>Thin</b> <b>Man,</b> the Edwards brothers and Leech decided to introduce the character and his dog into the film as an homage. They considered several different types of animals before settling on making him a frog.|$|E

60|$|While he {{was still}} sobbing away at a most furious rate he heard a voice close at his elbow, and, looking up, saw <b>the</b> <b>thinnest</b> <b>man</b> {{he had ever seen}} in all his life.

5|$|These four {{created and}} tested all the {{elements}} of <b>the</b> <b>Thin</b> <b>Man</b> design between April 1943 and August 1944. Parsons, who had developed the proximity fuze for the Navy, ran the division, and handled liaison with other agencies. As the head of the E-6 Projectile, Target, and Source Group, Critchfield calculated critical masses, and instituted a system of live testing with scale models using 20 mm cannon and 3-inch guns. While full-scale Thin Man tubes took months to produce, these were readily and easily obtained. It was not possible to conduct tests with plutonium, as it was not yet available. Indeed, the actual physical characteristics of the metal were little more than educated guesses at this time.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} atomic bombs were {{developed}} concurrently during the war: {{a relatively simple}} gun-type fission weapon and a more complex implosion-type nuclear weapon. <b>The</b> <b>Thin</b> <b>Man</b> gun-type design proved impractical to use with plutonium so a simpler gun-type called Little Boy was developed that used uranium-235, an isotope that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. Chemically identical to the most common isotope, uranium-238, and with almost the same mass, it proved difficult to separate the two. Three methods were employed for uranium enrichment: electromagnetic, gaseous and thermal. Most of this work was performed at the Clinton Engineer Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{months before}} Conran made the movie with his actors, he shot it entirely with stand-ins in Los Angeles and then created the whole movie in {{animatics}} {{so that the}} actors had {{an idea of what}} the film would look like and where to move on the soundstage. To prepare for the film, Conran had his cast watch old movies, such as Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not (1944) for Paltrow's performance and <b>The</b> <b>Thin</b> <b>Man</b> (1934) for the relationship between Nick and Nora that was to be echoed in the one between Joe and Polly. Avnet constantly pushed for room in this meticulously designed movie for the kind of freedom the actors needed, like being able to move around on the soundstage.|$|E

5|$|The terrier George {{was played}} by Skippy, known as Asta in <b>The</b> <b>Thin</b> <b>Man</b> film series and co-starring with Grant (as Mr. Smith) in The Awful Truth. The tame leopard Baby and the escaped circus leopard were both {{played by a}} trained leopard, Nissa. The big cat was {{supervised}} by its trainer, Olga Celeste, who stood by with a whip during shooting. At one point, when Hepburn spun around (causing her skirt to twirl) Nissa lunged at her and was subdued when Celeste cracked her whip. Hepburn wore heavy perfume to keep Nissa calm and was unafraid of the leopard, but Grant was terrified; most scenes of the two interacting are done in close-up with a stand-in. Hepburn played upon this fear by throwing a toy leopard through the roof of Grant's dressing room during production There were also several news reports about Hawks' difficulty filming a live leopard, and some scenes required rear-screen projection.|$|E
5|$|Universal Studios head Carl Laemmle, Jr. {{was eager}} for James Whale, fresh from his great success with Bride of Frankenstein, to direct Dracula's Daughter. Whale was idle, waiting for Irene Dunne to finish work on Magnificent Obsession {{so she could}} begin work on Whale's Show Boat. Wary of {{directing}} two horror films in a row, Whale instead convinced Laemmle to buy the rights to a mystery novel called The Hangover Murders. Whale argued that {{the same sort of}} audiences who went to horror films also went to mystery films and pointed to the hit Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film <b>The</b> <b>Thin</b> <b>Man</b> as evidence that a picture based on the novel would be a success. Laemmle agreed to buy the rights for $5,000, only after extracting a promise from Whale that he would direct Dracula's Daughter next.|$|E
5|$|With {{the success}} of Bride, Laemmle was eager to put Whale to work on Dracula's Daughter (1936), the sequel to Universal's first big horror hit of the sound era. Whale, wary of doing two horror films {{in a row and}} {{concerned}} that directing Dracula's Daughter could interfere with his plans for the first all-sound version of Show Boat (previously filmed as a part-talkie by Harry A. Pollard), instead convinced Laemmle to buy the rights to a novel called The Hangover Murders. The novel is a comedy-mystery in the style of <b>The</b> <b>Thin</b> <b>Man,</b> about a group of friends who were so drunk the night one of them was murdered that none can remember anything. Retitled Remember Last Night?, the film was one of Whale's personal favorites, but met with sharply divided reviews and commercial disinterest.|$|E

The couple never married.|$|E
25|$|Her {{successes in}} Manhattan Melodrama and <b>The</b> <b>Thin</b> <b>Man</b> marked {{a turning point}} in her career, and she was cast in more {{important}} pictures. Such films as Wife vs. Secretary (1936) with Clark Gable and Jean Harlow, and Petticoat Fever (1936) with Robert Montgomery gave her opportunity to develop comedic skills. She made four films in close succession with William Powell: Libeled Lady (1936), which also starred Jean Harlow and Spencer Tracy, The Great Ziegfeld (1936), in which she played Billie Burke opposite Powell's Florenz Ziegfeld, the second Thin Man film, After <b>the</b> <b>Thin</b> <b>Man</b> with Powell and James Stewart, and the romantic comedy Double Wedding (1937). She also made three more films with Gable.|$|E
25|$|Trained as a dancer, Loy devoted herself {{fully to}} an acting career {{following}} {{a few minor}} roles in silent films.

They retire for the night after giving Bosley the laptop computer that communicates with the Redstar computer. Dylan takes up Knox's offer to spend the night with him, end up in making love but he betrays her later that night, explaining that he faked the kidnapping with help from Vivian and <b>the</b> Creepy <b>Thin</b> <b>Man.</b> He has kidnapped Bosley, and, with access to Redstar's central computer, he intends to use his voice software with the Redstar satellite network to find and kill Charlie, who he believes had killed his father in the Vietnam War.|$|R
60|$|And in this fashion, while <b>the</b> <b>thin,</b> dark <b>man</b> and <b>the</b> large, {{blond woman}} warbled dulcetly {{out on the}} stage and the other {{professionals}} followed in their turns, did Charley Welsh put Edna wise, giving her much miscellaneous and superfluous information and much that she stored away for the Sunday Intelligencer.|$|R
25|$|In early 1943 Oppenheimer {{determined}} that two projects should proceed forwards: <b>the</b> <b>Thin</b> <b>Man</b> project (plutonium gun) and the Fat Man project (plutonium implosion). The plutonium gun was {{to receive the}} bulk of the research effort, as it was the project with the most uncertainty involved. It was assumed that the uranium gun-type bomb could then be adapted from it.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Loy {{was highly}} {{regarded}} for her performances in romantic comedies, {{and she was}} anxious to demonstrate her dramatic ability, and was cast in the lead female role in The Rains Came (1939) opposite Tyrone Power. She filmed Third Finger, Left Hand (1940) with Melvyn Douglas and appeared in I Love You Again (1940), Love Crazy (1941), and Shadow of <b>the</b> <b>Thin</b> <b>Man</b> (1941), all with William Powell.|$|E
