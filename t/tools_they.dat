5|$|The doctors {{decided that}} Huskisson {{was likely to}} survive but his injured leg was likely to need amputation. With no {{medicines}} or surgical <b>tools,</b> <b>they</b> waited {{for the arrival of}} the surgical equipment and medical specialists Stephenson had gone to summon from Manchester.|$|E
5|$|ReTool {{bought and}} sold used tools. Winmark opened the first ReTool on November 10, 1999, in Chicago. Roughly 65% of ReTool's goods were {{purchased}} from people, while the remainder was purchased from factories that produced too many tools or from closing businesses. CEO John Morgan said in an October 2000 interview that many people did not sell <b>tools</b> <b>they</b> did not use so {{it was hard to}} accumulate used tools at ReTool. Winmark sold ReTool around 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{fresh water}} {{entering}} Florida Bay from the Everglades creates ideal conditions for vast beds of turtle grass and algae formations that foster animal {{life in the}} bay. Sea turtles and manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) eat the grass, while invertebrates such as worms, clams, and other mollusks consume algae formations and microscopic plankton. Female sea turtles return annually to nest on the shore, and manatees spend the winter months in the warmer water of the bay. The Calusa Indians had various uses for shells of marine invertebrates, {{due to the lack}} of dense rock with which to make <b>tools.</b> <b>They</b> used the horse conch (Pleuroploca gigantea), left-handed whelk (Busycon contrarium), and the Florida crown conch (Melongena corona) as drinking vessels, picks, hammers, knives and awls.|$|E
25|$|The main <b>tool</b> <b>they</b> adopted {{for this}} was The Open Source Definition.|$|R

5|$|The oldest {{method of}} {{studying}} {{the brain is}} anatomical, and {{until the middle of}} the 20th century, much of the progress in neuroscience came from the development of better cell stains and better microscopes. Neuroanatomists study the large-scale structure of the brain as well as the microscopic structure of neurons and their components, especially synapses. Among other <b>tools,</b> <b>they</b> employ a plethora of stains that reveal neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity. In recent years, the development of immunostaining techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes. Also, functional neuroanatomy uses medical imaging techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior.|$|E
5|$|Wakeley saw Blast Corps as {{a puzzle}} game at its core. He was {{influenced}} by the 1994 Donkey Kong, in which the player begins each level with all the <b>tools</b> <b>they</b> need to finish but must learn how to use them. Wakeley said this was Blast Corp core game mechanic. He was also inspired by the Super Mario 64 demo at the 1995 Space World, which introduced him to the 3D analog stick and spurred him achieve something similar. The team's technical accomplishments included character and environment models composed completely of polygons and the absence of distance fog to obscure the draw distance.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon's natural {{resources}} {{are very well}} suited to agriculture and arboriculture. An estimated 70% of the population farms, and agriculture comprised an estimated 19.8% of GDP in 2009. Most agriculture is done at the subsistence scale by local farmers using simple <b>tools.</b> <b>They</b> sell their surplus produce, and some maintain separate fields for commercial use. Urban centres are particularly reliant on peasant agriculture for their foodstuffs. Soils and climate on the coast encourage extensive commercial cultivation of bananas, cocoa, oil palms, rubber, and tea. Inland on the South Cameroon Plateau, cash crops include coffee, sugar, and tobacco. Coffee is a major cash crop in the western highlands, and in the north, natural conditions favour crops such as cotton, groundnuts, and rice. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Cameroon vulnerable to shifts in their prices.|$|E
50|$|Practically, {{seasonal}} subseries plots {{are often}} inspected as a preliminary screening <b>tool.</b> <b>They</b> allow visual inferences {{to be drawn}} from data prior to modelling and forecasting.|$|R

5|$|In December 1974 Bill Gates was {{a student}} at Harvard University and Paul Allen worked for Honeywell in Boston. They saw the Altair 8800 {{computer}} in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics and knew it was powerful enough to support a BASIC interpreter. They wanted {{to be the first to}} offer BASIC for the Altair computer, and the software development <b>tools</b> <b>they</b> had previously created for their Intel 8008 microprocessor based Traf-O-Data computer would give them a head start. While their friend, Paul Gilbert, was building the computer, Allen wrote a program that ran on a DEC PDP-10 time-sharing computer that simulated the 8008 system. He also modified DEC's macro assembler to produce the machine code for the 8008 microprocessor. The Traf-O-Data software could be written and debugged before the computer hardware was complete.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after dawn, in the air, a Japanese force {{consisting}} of eight dive bombers with 12 Zero fighter escorts attacked the Allied airfield at Gili Gili. One of the attacking aircraft was shot down, while {{only a small}} amount of damage was inflicted. Meanwhile, around the mission as the Japanese reconnoitred Australian positions, the 2/10th Infantry Battalion, {{consisting of}} just 420 men, was ordered to the Gama River by Clowes. This operation was badly planned and did not have a clear purpose; it was launched as both a reconnaissance in force and a counter-attack, but evolved into an attempt to establish a blocking force at KB Mission. Moreover, while the Australians had no knowledge of the strength or intentions of the Japanese, no force would be able to reinforce the battalion once it moved outside the main defensive lines near the airstrips. The 2/10th's forward patrols made contact with the 61st Infantry Battalion at around 10:30am on 27 August and, upon arrival at around 5:00pm, they began to establish their position; with only limited entrenching <b>tools,</b> <b>they</b> found the going difficult. At this point, the troops from the 25th and 61st Battalion were ordered to pull back, having lost 18 men killed and a further 18 wounded, along with an unknown number missing in action.|$|E
25|$|By 4 {{million years}} ago, several australopithecine hominid species had {{developed}} throughout Southern, Eastern and Central Africa. They were tool users, and makers of <b>tools.</b> <b>They</b> scavenged for meat and were omnivores.|$|E
5000|$|Another interative <b>tool</b> <b>they</b> {{used was}} [...] "Bliss Paint" [...] invented by Greg Jalbert, which was {{essentially}} a screensaver program modified {{to be controlled by}} audience for changing the visual imagery of the performance.|$|R
5000|$|Size of {{the marine}} parks are {{inadequate}} as a conservation <b>tool.</b> <b>They</b> currently cover less than 1% of Hong Kong's marine areas. Various conservation groups are suggesting that these need to increase to at least 40%.|$|R
50|$|The DMI design {{grain wagon}} was {{incorporated}} into the product line, along with several lines purchased from United Farm <b>Tool.</b> <b>They</b> include the no till grain drill, the “Speedy” bean cutter, the multi crop shredder and the high dump wagon.|$|R
25|$|Paradoxically, {{within the}} wide range of Acheulean objects, hand axes are one of the {{simplest}} <b>tools.</b> <b>They</b> do not require as much planning as other types of object, generally made from flakes, that are less striking but more sophisticated.|$|E
25|$|Pocket knives {{are legal}} to own in most countries, but may face legal {{restrictions}} on their use. While pocket knives {{are almost always}} designed as <b>tools,</b> <b>they</b> do {{have the potential to}} be considered by legal authorities as weapons.|$|E
25|$|The {{demand for}} metal parts {{led to the}} {{development}} of several machine <b>tools.</b> <b>They</b> have their origins in the tools developed in the 18th century by makers of clocks and watches and scientific instrument makers to enable them to batch-produce small mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|Seeing {{how desperate}} the {{situation}} has become, the Arizona Kid goes to retrieve the United States Cavalry while Moe and Shemp attempt to free Larry using every <b>tool</b> <b>they</b> can find. Eventually, they spring Larry and defeat Barker and his gang.|$|R
5000|$|Access keys can be {{protected}} by {{a wide range of}} encryption and hashing algorithms provided by the libgcrypt library, which can be compatible with the OpenSSL command-line <b>tool.</b> <b>They</b> can be stored and backed-up separately from the filesystem that they protect.|$|R
50|$|Foldit's {{developers}} {{wanted to}} attract {{as many people}} as possible to the cause of protein folding. So, rather than only building a useful science <b>tool,</b> <b>they</b> used gamification (the inclusion of gaming elements) to make Foldit appealing and engaging to the general public.|$|R
25|$|Homo neanderthalensis used Mousterian Stone {{tools that}} {{date back to}} around 300,000 years ago and include smaller, knife-like and scraper <b>tools.</b> <b>They</b> buried their dead in shallow graves along with stone tools and animal bones, {{although}} the reasons and significance of the burials are disputed.|$|E
25|$|Two newer studies {{examined}} {{the frequency of}} collisions in two regional districts using the latest analytical <b>tools.</b> <b>They</b> investigated the potential correlation between street network patterns and frequency of collisions. In one study, cul-de-sac networks appeared to be much safer than grid networks, by nearly three to one.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Senators Brown and Bob Menendez co-authored the Military Families Credit Reporting Act to {{safeguard}} financial security for service members while deployed {{on active duty}} and requested specific information and feedback to help ensure deployed military personnel have the <b>tools</b> <b>they</b> need to protect their credit.|$|E
50|$|Igglo was a Finnish {{real estate}} broker startup. Igglo relied {{strongly}} on the web and offers a web service with photographs and data of buildings plotted on a map. By using {{the internet as a}} <b>tool</b> <b>they</b> promised to halve real estate commissions.|$|R
30|$|The ALTDDIO modules {{are also}} {{generated}} by the MegaWizard <b>tool.</b> <b>They</b> have the purpose to generate data in DDR standard, and its internal registers are implemented in silicon hard registers, i.e., directly on the FPGA microarchitecture, ensuring lower rates of skew in the data output.|$|R
50|$|These are a {{range of}} gauges {{that are used to}} measure a bore's size, by {{transferring}} the internal dimension to a remote measuring <b>tool.</b> <b>They</b> are a direct equivalent of inside calipers and require the operator to develop the correct feel to obtain repeatable results.|$|R
25|$|Number {{theory has}} the {{reputation}} of being a field many of whose results can be stated to the layperson. At the same time, the proofs of these results are not particularly accessible, in part because the range of <b>tools</b> <b>they</b> use is, if anything, unusually broad within mathematics.|$|E
25|$|The {{game has}} been {{designed}} to be mod-able. Lionhead has stated that they might release the actual <b>tools</b> <b>they</b> used to create scenes (though no such thing has been seen yet), shortly after the release of the game, along with expansion packs. Alongside this, unofficial mods are possible, leading to extra props, sets, animations, scenes, and clothing designs.|$|E
25|$|Many partially-worked hand axes do {{not require}} further work {{in order to be}} {{effective}} <b>tools.</b> <b>They</b> can be considered to be simple hand axes. Less suitable tool stone requires more thorough working. In some specimens the cortex is unrecognisable due to the complete working that it has undergone, which has eliminated any vestige of the original cortex.|$|E
50|$|The modern Western {{interpretation}} of the karambit is {{far removed from the}} original agricultural <b>tool.</b> <b>They</b> may have folding blades, are finished to a high standard, made from expensive materials as opposed to being rudimentary and makeshift and are generally larger to accommodate larger hands.|$|R
