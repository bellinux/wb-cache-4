5|$|A 2009 {{resource}} {{assessment of}} the Cumberland Island National Seashore by the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) estimated that there were approximately 200 feral horses on Cumberland Island.

5|$|About forty {{days after}} mating, the female giant Pacific octopus {{attaches}} strings of small fertilised eggs (10,000 to 70,000 in <b>total)</b> <b>to</b> rocks in a crevice or under an overhang.

The female aerates the eggs and keeps them clean; if left untended, many eggs will not hatch. She does not feed during this time and dies soon afterwards. Males become senescent and die {{a few weeks after}} mating.|$|E
