5|$|The postcranial {{anatomy of}} Heterodontosaurus tucki has been well-described, {{although}} H. tucki {{is generally considered}} the most derived of the Early Jurassic heterodontosaurids, so it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of its features were shared with other species. The forelimbs were long for a dinosaur, over 70% {{of the length of}} the hindlimbs. The well-developed deltopectoral crest (a ridge for the attachment of chest and shoulder muscles) of the humerus and prominent olecranon process (where muscles that extend the forearm were attached) of the ulna indicate that the forelimb was powerful as well. There were five digits on the manus ('hand'). The first was large, tipped with a sharply curved claw, and would rotate inwards when flexed; Robert Bakker called it the 'twist-thumb'. The second digit was the longest, slightly longer than the third. Both of these digits bore claws, while the clawless fourth and fifth digits were very small and simple in comparison. In the hindlimb, the tibia was 30% longer than the femur, which is generally considered an adaptation for speed. The tibia and fibula of the lower leg were fused to the astragalus and calcaneum of the ankle, forming a 'tibiofibiotarsus' convergently with modern birds. Also similarly to birds, the lower tarsal (ankle) bones and metatarsals were fused to form a 'tarsometatarsus.' There are four digits in the pes (hindfoot), with only the second, third, and fourth contacting the ground. The tail, unlike many other ornithischians, did not have ossified tendons to maintain a rigid posture and was probably flexible. The fragmentary skeleton known for Abrictosaurus has never been fully described, although the forelimb and manus were smaller than in Heterodontosaurus. Also, the fourth and fifth digits of the forelimb each bear one fewer phalanx bone.|$|E

25|$|Permutations occur, in {{more or less}} {{prominent}} ways, {{in almost}} every area of mathematics. They often arise when different orderings on certain finite sets are considered, possibly only because one wants to ignore such orderings and needs <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> configurations are thus identified. For similar reasons permutations arise {{in the study of}} sorting algorithms in computer science.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, Reno tasked the Justice Department with {{compiling}} {{a report on}} DNA exoneration. The science was still new {{at that point in}} time.

She wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> cases existed like the one she read about and what the Department of Justice could learn from it. The resulting report concluded there was a strong possibility that many more wrongful convictions which could be cleared with DNA evidence existed. Reno changed policies on how to interview eye witnesses and laboratory protocols in response.|$|E
25|$|Bryant's {{motivation}} for the massacre remains a closely guarded secret, known only to his lawyer, who is bound not to reveal confidences without his client's consent. The lawyer later released a book outlining that Bryant was motivated largely by the media reports of the then-recent Dunblane school massacre. From the moment he was captured, he continually wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> people he had killed and seemed impressed by the number. Bryant is only allowed {{to listen to music}} on a radio outside his cell, and is denied access to any news reports of his massacre. Photographers allowed in to take pictures of him in his prison cell were forced to destroy the film in his presence when the Governor found out.|$|E
25|$|Several {{countries}} either {{restricted the}} drug's use or never approved it. Ingeborg Eichler, {{a member of}} the Austrian pharmaceutical admission conference, enforced thalidomide (tradename Softenon) being sold under the rules of prescription medication and as a result relatively few affected children were born in Austria and Switzerland. In the United States, pharmacologist Frances Oldham Kelsey M.D. withstood pressure from the Richardson-Merrell company and refused Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to market thalidomide, saying further studies were needed. This reduced the impact of thalidomide in United States patients. Although thalidomide was never approved for sale in the United States at the time, millions of tablets had been distributed to physicians during a clinical testing program. It was impossible <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> pregnant women had been given the drug to help alleviate morning sickness or as a sedative.|$|E

50|$|Unlike the United States Census, the United Kingdom Census doesn't {{include a}} {{category}} {{for individuals to}} identify as 'Latin American' and it is therefore fairly difficult <b>to</b> <b>know</b> exactly <b>how</b> <b>many</b> UK citizens or residents are of Latin American ethnic or national origin. One guesstimate based on data supplied by Latin American embassies suggests that there could between 700,000 and 1,000,000 Latin Americans residing in the United Kingdom, with Brazilians and Colombians constituting the two largest subgroups.|$|R
25|$|There were {{considerable}} {{difficulties in}} the operation of the contracts and the management of the men. During the period 1870–1875, power gradually transferred from the Provinces to the central government, partly because of the railway question. The Bill to abolish the Provinces was carried in October 1875 and implemented a year later. However, in the interim {{it was very difficult for}} Brogdens to get clear prompt decisions. Brogdens got less work than they had hoped and it became available more slowly than expected. Communications between UK and New Zealand were obviously slow so it was difficult <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> men to send at any given time. Sometimes Brogdens could not find work for the men when they arrived. Men reneged on their promissory notes. There were disputes over working hours, wages and whether they should be paid when the weather stopped the work. Gradually the men drifted away. By August 1873, 2172 English immigrants had been brought out. They included 1299 working-age men who were contracted to work for Brogdens for two years but only 287 of them were still working for them. Most of the men were agricultural labourers, rather than true navvies and they found local agricultural labour and working conditions more attractive than navvy work.|$|E

Because ducking was a secondary occupation, it was not listed in Aylesbury's census returns or directories and it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> people were engaged in it at any given time.

500|$|It is {{impossible}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> died from salt deprivation in India {{as a result}} of the salt tax as salt deficiency was not often recorded as a cause of death and was instead more likely to worsen the effects of other diseases and hinder recoveries. [...] It is known that the equalisation of tax made salt cheaper on the whole, decreasing the tax imposed on 130million people and increasing it on just 47million, leading to an increase in the use of the mineral. [...] Consumption grew by 50percent between 1868 and 1888 and doubled by 1911, by which time salt had become cheaper (relatively) than at any earlier stage of Indian history.|$|E

500|$|In {{the lead}} up to Churchill's next meeting with Eisenhower in June 1954, the President's {{assistant}} for atomic energy, Major General Howard G. Bunker, discussed carriage of American atomic bombs in British aircraft with the BJSM. A detailed list of the equipment and technical data required was drawn up, and the USAF undertook to provide training and technical assistance. It would also establish facilities to store, assemble and assist with loading the bombs. The McMahon act was amended in August 1954, and while it did not go nearly {{as far as the}} British government wanted—the transfer of information regarding the design and manufacture of nuclear weapons was still prohibited—it did now allow for the interchange of information on their use. This {{paved the way for the}} Agreement for Cooperation Regarding Atomic Information for Mutual Defence Purposes with Britain, which was signed on 12 June 1955. A colonel and two majors from the USAF and the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project were given briefings on RAF aircraft [...] to determine which American bombs could be carried. The Americans then wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> bombs would be required. The Minister of Defence, Harold Macmillan, determined that the V-bomber force would reach a strength of 240 aircraft during 1958.|$|E
500|$|Spector's {{role as a}} {{producer}} gave him the job of explaining the game to the publisher, which he called his [...] "biggest challenge". He explained that they [...] "didn't always get what the team was trying to do", and said, [...] "You don't want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> times the game came this close to being killed (or how late in the project)". According to Church, Looking Glass' internal management largely ignored System Shock, {{in favor of the}} concurrently-developed Flight Unlimited—the game [...] "that had to be the hit, because it was the self-published title". Spector organized a licensing deal between Electronic Arts and Looking Glass that gave the former the trademark to the game, but the latter the copyright. His goal was to ensure that neither party could continue the franchise without the other's involvement. While Cyberspace was originally conceived as a realistic hacking simulation—which could even be used to reimplement SHODAN's ethical constraints—it was simplified after Origin Systems deemed it too complicated. The game's star field system was written by programmer James Fleming. Marc LeBlanc was the main creator of the game's HUD, which he later believed was too complicated. He said that it was [...] "very much the Microsoft Word school of user interface", in that there was no [...] "feature that you [...] see on the screen and touch and play with".|$|E
