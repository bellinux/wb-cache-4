5|$|At age ten, {{his older}} brother Burnie {{recalled}} that he stopped coming home for supper, instead hurrying down to the riverfront and slipping aboard {{one or another of}} the excursion boats to play the Calliope. A friend remembered that the plots of the silent matinees Bix and his friends watched on Saturdays didn't interest him much, {{but as soon as the}} lights came on he would rush home <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> duplicate the melodies the accompanist had played during the action.|$|E
5|$|Gruban appealed {{against the}} {{internment}} order, and was called before a court consisting of Mr Justice Younger and Mr Justice Sankey. After reviewing {{the facts of}} the case and the stories of Gruban and Booth the judges ordered the immediate release of Gruban, and recommended that he seek legal advice <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> regain control of his company. After he was released Gruban found a solicitor, W.J. Synott, who gave the case to Patrick Hastings.|$|E
5|$|Lavelli {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Hudson, Ohio, a small town in the northeastern part of the state. Both of his parents were Italian immigrants. His father Angelo Lavelli was a {{blacksmith}} who made shoes for horses on nearby farms. As a child, he practiced catching by throwing baseballs against walls and trying to catch them when they bounced back. He liked to have friends throw ping-pong balls at him <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> catch them.|$|E

5|$|Pritchard {{received}} word from local residents {{that on the}} night before a party, probably including the Confederate President, had crossed the Ocmulgee River just north of Abbeville. Since there were two roads to Irwindale, one of which had been taken by Harnden and his men, Pritchard decided to take the other, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> capture Davis. He took with him about a hundred and forty men and their horses, while the balance of the Michiganders stayed on the Ocmulgee River near Abbeville. Some seven hours later, at 1 A.M. on May 10, Pritchard arrived at Irwindale. There was no evidence of Harnden's men being there yet.|$|E
5|$|In January 1934, Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot {{announced}} that they had bombarded elements with alpha particles and induced radioactivity in them. By March, Fermi's assistant Gian-Carlo Wick had provided a theoretical explanation using Fermi's theory of beta decay. Fermi decided to switch to experimental physics, using the neutron, which James Chadwick had discovered in 1932. In March 1934, Fermi wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> induce radioactivity with Rasetti's polonium-beryllium neutron source. Neutrons had no electric charge, and so would not be deflected by the positively charged nucleus. This meant that they needed much less energy to penetrate the nucleus than charged particles, and so would not require a particle accelerator, which the Via Panisperna boys did not have.|$|E
5|$|Washbrook and Hutton then {{strode to}} the crease as England faced a short burst of Australian pace before the lunch break. Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin after {{delivering}} the first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered, and his first over was a maiden. Seeing Lindwall struggle through the pain barrier, Bradman tossed the ball to Miller at the start off the second over <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> lift and bowl as well. However, Miller threw the ball back to his captain, indicating that his body {{would not be able}} to withstand the strain. This resulted in media speculation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.|$|E
50|$|While the Minotaur {{is faster}} than the player, his moves are {{predictable}} and often inefficient: they are determined by checking <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> can {{get closer to the}} player by moving horizontally, then checking <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> can get any closer by moving vertically. If neither move would place him closer to the player, the Minotaur skips his turn. Theseus may also skip his turn.|$|R

25|$|Lawrence {{walked along}} Well Hall Road to the {{junction}} of Dickson Road <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> see a bus coming {{and then went back}} towards the bus stop. Brooks was still on Well Hall Road, part way between Dickson Road and the roundabout with Rochester Way and Westhorne Avenue.|$|E
25|$|Mustain went undrafted in the 2011 NFL Draft, {{and signed}} a 10-day free agent {{contract}} with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League on June 1, 2011 <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> win a backup job. He was unable to impress and was released by the Tiger-Cats on June 10, 2011.|$|E

25|$|An anecdote {{often told}} of Zwicky {{concerns}} an informal experiment <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> reduce problems with turbulence hindering an observation session {{one night at}} Mount Wilson observatory. He told his assistant to fire a gun out through the telescope slit, in the hope it would help to smooth out the turbulence. No effect was noticed, but the event shows the kind of lateral thinking for which Zwicky was famous.|$|E
25|$|He {{finally did}} it on lap 34 and Senna came into the pits for tyres. When he rejoined, the order was Mansell, Prost, Berger, Schumacher, Senna and de Cesaris. Senna was on a charge, passing Schumacher {{immediately}} after his stop. Berger then waved him through <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> attack Prost. Behind them, on lap 45, Piquet passed de Cesaris for sixth. Senna got ahead of Prost on the second chicane with seven laps remaining. Mansell won from Senna, Prost, Berger, Schumacher and Piquet.|$|E
25|$|On February 16, 2014, Burnett {{signed a}} one-year, $15 million {{contract}} with the Philadelphia Phillies. The deal included a mutual option for the 2015 season and a limited no-trade clause. On April 27, 2014, {{it was revealed that}} Burnett was diagnosed with an inguinal hernia. He received a cortisone shot <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> forgo surgery {{until the end of the}} season. He ended the 2014 season 8–18 with a 4.59 ERA. His 96 walks issued and 18 losses each led the Major Leagues.|$|E

25|$|During his youth, he {{happened}} upon a robin's nest that held hatchlings. Woolman began throwing {{rocks at the}} mother robin <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hit her. After killing the mother bird, he was filled with remorse, thinking of the baby birds who had no chance of survival without her. He got the nest down from the tree and quickly killed the hatchlings, believing {{it to be the}} most merciful thing to do. This experience weighed on his heart. He was inspired to love and protect all living things from then on.|$|E
25|$|Honner set {{out with}} Sergeant T. G. Pryor and three privates <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> find water in A Company's area around Koram. At around 15:00, they {{came across a}} banana plantation, and saw troops moving around in it. They assumed that they were from A Company, but when they {{approached}} they were fired on, and Honner and Pryor were both wounded. Pryor, wounded in the throat and chest, attempted to drag Honner, who {{was wounded in the}} thigh and could not move easily, but Honner ordered him to return to get help. Private W. H. G. remained to protect Honner; the other two privates accompanied Pryor.|$|E
25|$|Gibson {{made the}} All-Star team again in 1965 season, {{and when the}} Cardinals were well out of the pennant race by August, {{attention}} turned on Gibson <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> win 20 games for the first time. Gibson was still looking for win number 20 {{on the last day}} of the season, a game where new Cardinals manager Red Schoendienst rested many of the regular players. Gibson still prevailed against the Houston Astros by a score of 5–2. The 1966 season marked the opening of Busch Memorial Stadium for the Cardinals, and Gibson was selected to play in the All-Star Game in front of the hometown crowd that year as well.|$|E

25|$|In that version, Set held {{a banquet}} for Osiris {{in which he}} brought in a {{beautiful}} box and said that whoever could fit in the box perfectly would get to keep it. Set had measured Osiris in his sleep and made {{sure that he was}} the only one who could fit the box. Several tried to see whether they fit. Once it was Osiris's turn <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> fit in the box, Set closed the lid on him so that the box was now a coffin for Osiris. Set flung the box in the Nile so that it would drift far away. Isis went looking for the box so that Osiris could have a proper burial. She found the box in a tree in Byblos, a city along the Phoenician coast, and brought it back to Egypt, hiding it in a swamp. But Set went hunting that night and found the box. Enraged, Set chopped Osiris's body into fourteen pieces and scattered them all over Egypt to ensure that Isis could never find Osiris again for a proper burial.|$|E
500|$|Most {{electronic}} {{elements were}} not overdubbed but recorded {{live in the}} studio. Greenwood used the music programming language Max to sample and manipulate the band's playing in real time, and continued to use modular synthesisers and the ondes Martenot, an early theremin-like electronic instrument he had first used on Kid A. After using effects pedals heavily on previous albums, he mostly used clean guitar sounds <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> [...] "come up with interesting things" [...] without effects.|$|E
