2500|$|During the 1970s, {{a number}} of issues arose which were to have {{significant}} influence on the course of the Society.

Lloyd's income counted as earned income, even for Names who did not work at Lloyd's, and this heavily influenced the direction of underwriting: in short, it was desirable for syndicates to make a (small) underwriting loss but a (larger) investment gain. The investment gain was typically achieved by [...] "bond washing" [...] or [...] "gilt stripping": selling the gilt or other bond cum dividend and buying it back ex dividend, thus forfeiting the interest income in exchange for a tax-free capital gain. Syndicate funds were also moved offshore (which later created problems through fraud and self-dealing).|$|R

50|$|For example, {{suppose there}} are tax {{brackets}} of 10%, 20%, and 30%, where the 10% rate applies to income from $1 to $10,000; the 20% rate applies to income from $10,001 to $20,000; and the 30% rate {{applies to all}} income above $20,000. In that case the tax on $20,000 of income (computed by adding up tax in each bracket) is 10% × $10,000 + 20% × $10,000 = $1,000 + $2,000 = $3,000.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{how much of}} the top end of the income distribution can be attributed to four sectors [...] top executives of non-financial firms (Main Street); financial service sector employees from investment banks, hedge funds, private equity funds, and mutual funds (Wall Street); corporate lawyers; and professional athletes and celebrities. Non-financial public company CEOs and top executives do not represent more than 6. 5 % of any of the <b>top</b> AGI <b>brackets</b> (the <b>top</b> 0. 1 %, 0. 01 %, 0. 001 %, and 0. 0001 %).
