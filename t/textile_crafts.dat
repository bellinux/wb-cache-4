40|$|Alexander’s {{textiles}} artefacts and installations reference {{the discourse}} in Queer Theory and Craft Theory, challenging {{the validity of}} heteronormative textiles practices though queering ‘normal’ masculinised (i. e. building hardware) objects with feminised <b>textiles</b> <b>craft</b> materials and processes. Through his textiles practices, queer is given a (subjective) point of reference {{in the form of}} a creative artefact(s). This point of reference, the creative artefact(s), defies specific definition as it is continuously subjectified and ‘shifted’ by the viewer, thus allowing multiple readings. This relationality engages with the discourse on Relational Aesthetics (Bourriaud, c 2002) a foundational theory of the a/r/tographic methodology applied to his research projects. Craft itself “has been defined many times, and yet remains elusive as a category, discipline and practice” (Niedderer & Townsend, 2010, p. 4). “Queer is by definition whatever is at odds with the normal, the legitimate, the dominant. There is nothing in particular to which it necessarily refers”(Halperin, 1995, p. 62) and Craft Theory is something ‘other’ than, and alternate to, the dominant critical art discourse. Craft theorist Glenn Adamson (2007, 2013) has argued that the interesting thing about craft is that it is perceived to be inferior or supplemental to art. Alexander’s textiles artefacts and installations construct a visual argument about the queer and marginalised status of <b>textiles</b> <b>crafts</b> within the fine arts discourse and that crafts practices could be considered an inherently queer practice. In this context, ‘Queer’ could be defined as non-normative, oppositional, and a reclaiming of the marginalised. Overlaying this is Alexander’s assertion of the highly gendered nature of textiles practices and that his textiles practices challenge accepted (hetero) normative codification of <b>textiles</b> arts and <b>crafts.</b> This encourages (re) assessment and (re) evaluation of <b>textiles</b> <b>crafts</b> practices and pedagogies (Kokko, 2009, 2012) ...|$|R

40|$|For over a millennium, {{the site}} of Hallstatt, located in the Austrian Alps, was a meeting point between north and south, east and west, serving as a melting pot of new ideas and innovations. About 300 textile units (more than 700 single fragments) from Bronze and Iron Ages are known from the prehistoric salt mines, dating from 1500 - 300 BC. They display {{a wide range of}} textile {{techniques}} and provide insight in different aspects of <b>textile</b> <b>craft.</b> Their outstanding preservation allows us to investigate many crucial steps in the chaîne opératoire of textile production. The 2 nd millennium BC is a time, when a lot of innovations in <b>textile</b> <b>craft</b> can be recognized, and Hallstatt offers some key finds. Recently, wool measurements were carried out, sampling not only Bronze and Iron Age textiles from the Hallstatt salt mines, but also skins found there. This enables us to study the development of sheep wool and its preparation techniques {{over a long period of}} time. This new data demonstrates that outstanding Bronze Age textiles also have specialized wool, although we do not know at this point if these textiles are imports or were produced locally. The Hallstatt finds are displaying novelties from the perspective of <b>textile</b> <b>craft,</b> such as earliest twills, dyeing, specific sewing techniques and the patterned tablet weave known in Europe so far. The occurrence of these techniques in the Bronze Age Hallstatt seems to indicate that it was an important transfer site for textile innovations. Bronze Age textile art clearly represents an invention phase, while these techniques developed and came to full use in the Iron Age, when we see them fully integrated into society. They influenced the social organisation, ideology and economy, especially of the representational culture of the higher strata during the Iron Age...|$|R
