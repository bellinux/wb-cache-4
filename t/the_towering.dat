5|$|The {{decision}} {{to hire an}} A-list ensemble cast for Mars Attacks! parallels the strategy Irwin Allen used for his disaster films, notably The Poseidon Adventure (1972) and <b>The</b> <b>Towering</b> Inferno (1974). Jack Nicholson, approached {{for the role of}} president, jokingly remarked he wanted to play all the roles. Burton agreed to cast Nicholson as both Art Land and President Dale, specifically remembering his positive working relationship with the actor on Batman.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} stories, those of David and Judith, were often linked in Renaissance art, {{particularly}} by Florentine artists as they demonstrated {{the overthrow of}} tyrants, a popular subject in the Republic. In this image, the shepherd boy, David, has brought down <b>the</b> <b>towering</b> Goliath with his sling, but the giant is alive {{and is trying to}} rise as David forces his head down to chop it off.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{cable car}} to carry pilgrims and {{visitors}} further uphill. On the elevated platform, {{there is a}} fish pond, and <b>the</b> <b>towering</b> statue of Kuan Yin, Goddess of Mercy which is worshipped by women to beget children. The monks and nuns, who are housed in a monastery and who are incharge maintenance and operation of the temple complex, consider it as a spiritual retreat to attain salvation.|$|E
5|$|The Stanley often showed blockbusters. Some movies {{shown at}} the theatre through the years {{included}} Duel in the Sun, Knock on Any Door, Ben-Hur, Mutiny on the Bounty, Doctor Zhivago, , The Exorcist, <b>The</b> <b>Towering</b> Inferno, The Muppet Movie, Apocalypse Now, The Empire Strikes Back, The Elephant Man, Poltergeist, The Right Stuff, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Top Gun, The Untouchables, Stakeout, Empire of the Sun, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and Goodfellas.|$|E
5|$|The cast {{consisted}} {{mostly of}} unknowns, though Isabel Bigley, {{who had just}} originated Sister Sarah Brown in Guys and Dolls, was given the leading role of chorus girl Jeanie. For Larry, the assistant stage manager {{who falls in love}} with Jeanie, they cast Bill Hayes, a well-known stage and television actor. William Tabbert, the original Lt. Joe Cable in South Pacific was considered for the part of Larry, but lost out because he was thought to be too tall to be afraid of Mark Dawson, hired as <b>the</b> <b>towering</b> bully Bob.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Heris <b>Tower</b> is a {{skyscraper}} {{located in}} Konak, Izmir. <b>The</b> <b>tower</b> is 124 meters (407 ft.) tall. It {{was built in}} 2001, and has 26 floors. There is a pyramid {{on the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tower</b> resembles <b>the</b> Melon Bank <b>Tower</b> in Philadelphia. <b>The</b> <b>tower</b> is <b>the</b> second tallest <b>tower</b> in Izmir behind the Hilton Izmir.|$|R
5|$|The {{relevance}} of Strype's reference to <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> {{was more than}} geographical. The East End was the major part of an area called <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> Division, which owed military service to <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London. Later, as the East End grew and <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> Division contracted, <b>the</b> East End became, arguably, conterminous with <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> Division.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tower</b> {{comprises}} three ironbark {{poles in}} a triangular plan, which taper inwards {{from the base}} of <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> to <b>the</b> top of <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> Each pole consists of two logs spliced together approximately halfway up the height of <b>the</b> <b>tower,</b> and is set into a concrete footing at the base of <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> Poles are braced and cross-braced.|$|R
5|$|The Muslim force, now {{numbering}} around 700, {{was stationed}} {{on the slopes}} of Uhud, facing Medina with the rear being protected by <b>the</b> <b>towering</b> mount itself. Before the battle, Muhammad had assigned 50 archers on a nearby rocky hill at the West side of the Muslim camp. This was a strategic decision in order to shield the vulnerable flanks of the outnumbered Muslim army; the archers on the hill were to protect the left flank, while the right flank was to be protected by the Mount of Uhud situated {{on the east side of}} the Muslim camp. Protecting the flanks of the Muslim army meant that the Meccan army would not be able to turn around the Muslim camp, and thus the Muslim army wouldn't be surrounded or encircled by the Meccan cavalry, keeping in mind that the Meccan cavalry outnumbered the Muslim cavalry with a 50:1 ratio.|$|E
5|$|These {{complexes}} {{were usually}} {{located in the}} site core, beside a principal plaza. Maya palaces consisted of a platform supporting a multiroom range structure. The term acropolis, in a Maya context, refers to a complex of structures built upon platforms of varying height. Palaces and acropoleis were essentially elite residential compounds. They generally extended horizontally as opposed to <b>the</b> <b>towering</b> Maya pyramids, and often had restricted access. Some structures in Maya acropoleis supported roof combs. Rooms often had stone benches, used for sleeping, and holes indicate where curtains once hung. Large palaces, such as at Palenque, could be fitted with a water supply, and sweat baths were often found within the complex, or nearby. During the Early Classic, rulers were sometimes buried underneath the acropolis complex. Some rooms in palaces were true throne rooms; in the royal palace of Palenque {{there were a number}} of throne rooms that were used for important events, including the inauguration of new kings.|$|E

50|$|Like Western Area Power Administration's 500 kV line, <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> {{design for}} <b>the</b> entire {{transmission}} {{system is not}} the same, although the difference is not as dramatic as on the WAPA line. For the PG&E line, the differences are subtle and from a casual, far away view, it looks like <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> are all <b>the</b> same for the entire power line. It seems to be south of the Table Mountain substation, <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> legs spread apart from <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> bridge (upper section of <b>tower)</b> down to <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> base and there are four guy lines for tower stability. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> to <b>the</b> north of Table Mountain have thinner legs and look like thin sticks from far away. <b>The</b> weaker <b>tower</b> legs have two additional guy lines for stability. As for <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> bridge, <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> south of Table Mountain have five X's in between <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> legs. <b>The</b> <b>towers</b> north of Table Mountain have only four X's. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> arms {{on either side of}} <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> have smaller steel bars inside for added strength. In <b>the</b> northern <b>towers,</b> they arepositioned like equilateral triangles, but south of Table Mountain, they are shaped like right triangles. See below for a visual comparison.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} installers of <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> antennas, other crews climb <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> to perform {{condition}} checks of <b>the</b> <b>towers,</b> guy lines and lighting systems. One {{of the most}} demanding aspects of many tower climber jobs is hauling materials and tools up to the proper installation height on <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> In most cases, the climber scales <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> to <b>the</b> desired height and lowers a rope to a ground crew member who then ties it to a needed part on <b>the</b> ground. <b>The</b> <b>tower</b> worker then pulls the piece up and secures the rope before installing the part onto <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 31 July 1981, a Belgian {{military}} aircraft hit <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> Debris of <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> killed {{a couple in}} a house near <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b>|$|R
25|$|McQueen {{was offered}} the lead in Raise the Titanic, but felt that the script was flat. He was under {{contract}} to Irwin Allen after appearing in <b>The</b> <b>Towering</b> Inferno and offered a part in a sequel in 1980, which he turned down. The film was scrapped and Newman was brought in by Allen to make When Time Ran Out, which was a box office bomb. McQueen died shortly after passing on <b>The</b> <b>Towering</b> Inferno 2.|$|E

50|$|The {{focus in}} the novel is the three aspects of <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London. To further this focus, Ainsworth depicts two crownings, a wedding, executions, and even a siege of <b>the</b> <b>Tower.</b> Lady Jane has her first night at <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> as <b>the</b> Queen of England, and she visits St John's Chapel, located in <b>the</b> White <b>Tower.</b> Later, she is kept as <b>the</b> <b>Tower's</b> prisoner. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> has gothic {{elements}} along with having {{a connection to the}} Catholic Church in its architecture. <b>The</b> <b>Tower,</b> in its style, also represented the sublime and the connection with the divine. With these various dimensions to <b>the</b> <b>Tower,</b> there is a connection between <b>The</b> <b>Tower</b> of London and Victor Hugo's Notre Dame de Paris, in their emphasis on architecture and with history.|$|R
5000|$|... 2008 In Impact, <b>The</b> <b>Tower</b> {{was seen}} when comets flying all over <b>The</b> <b>Tower</b> and A News Broadcaster {{standing}} {{right in front}} of <b>the</b> <b>Tower.</b>|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> 1490s <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> was rebuilt in stone. In the 1680s {{a line of}} ramparts {{was added}} that {{connected}} <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> to <b>the</b> square <b>tower.</b> <b>The</b> upper section was later rebuilt during the Napoleonic wars. Between 1847 and 1850 the roof of <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> was modified {{to serve as a}} gun platform. Portsmouth city council purchased <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> in 1958.|$|R
25|$|The Wheaton {{family owned}} {{the lands of}} Salt Springs State Park from 1840 until 1973, when they sold their land to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

25|$|From the summit, weather permitting, {{the vista}} reaches {{as far as}} Velebit Range along Croatia's rocky {{northern}} coast, {{as well as the}} snow-capped peaks of <b>the</b> <b>towering</b> Julian Alps in neighbouring Slovenia. There are several lodging villages, offering accommodation and restaurants for hikers. Skiers visit Sljeme, which has four ski-runs, three ski-lifts and a chairlift.|$|E
25|$|Peru's {{location}} {{near the}} equator {{and along the}} Pacific Ocean creates consistently mild temperatures year round. The soil is rich and sandy and <b>the</b> <b>towering</b> Andes mountains provide a constant flow of pure water for irrigation. Naturally sheltered as it is from heavy rain or freezing temperatures, Peru is an almost perfect climate for the cultivation of avocados.|$|E
50|$|In 1997 <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> {{underwent}} a renovation. The battlements were newly reinforced and <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> platform was completely reconstructed.
