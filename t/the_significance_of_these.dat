5|$|There are {{different}} opinions on <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> principles. Some {{note that the}} osteopathic medical philosophy is akin to the tenets of holistic medicine, suggestive {{of a kind of}} social movement within the field of medicine, one that promotes a more patient-centered, holistic approach to medicine, and emphasizes the role of the primary care physician within the health care system. Others point out that {{there is nothing in the}} principles that would distinguish D.O. from M.D. training in any fundamental way. One study, published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found a majority of M.D. medical school administrators and faculty saw nothing objectionable in the core principles listed above, and some endorse them generally as broad medical principles.|$|E
5|$|The two Ferrari {{cars and}} the Renault of Kubica became the first cars to queue up behind the safety car, {{while the rest of}} the field had enough notice to divert to the pitlane for their first stop. <b>The</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> events was that both Vettel and Hamilton were able to make their first stops before their {{advantage}} over the rest of the field was cancelled out by catching the safety car, while Alonso, Massa and Kubica fell down the order. Hamilton's stop was for a replacement front wing. The safety car drove into the pit lane at the end of lap 14 and the cars were allowed to overtake. Vettel locked his tyres and ran deep driving into the final turn, and resisted Hamilton's attempt at overtaking him. Alonso immediately pushed hard and passed Hülkenberg for ninth place at turn 17 on the 15th lap. A line of cars formed behind Kobayashi while Vettel and Hamilton pulled away from the rest of the field, as the front two began trading the fastest lap time of the event. Button gained a large amount of top speed but remained behind both Sauber cars. Schumacher passed both Virgin cars to move into the 17th position by lap 17.|$|E

30|$|Given the {{problems}} of existing studies, {{the objective of this}} paper is to investigate crash characteristics based on CR models and their influencing factors by facility type on urban expressway. Meanwhile, the causes are identified by considering the interaction of geometry, traffic flow, and ambient conditions. Besides, geometric features are identified considering the driver-vehicle-roadway interaction. <b>The</b> <b>significances</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> factors affecting crashes are compared at different facility types using principal component analysis (PCA). Their influencing mechanisms are further discussed. In essence, this study can be regarded as a proactive analysis for crash risk prediction model in the future.|$|R

25|$|In addition, glacial sediments of the Port Askaig Tillite Formation in Scotland clearly show {{interbedded}} {{cycles of}} glacial and shallow marine sediments. <b>The</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> deposits is highly reliant upon their dating. Glacial sediments {{are difficult to}} date, and the closest dated bed to the Portaskaig group is 8km stratigraphically above the beds of interest. Its dating to 600Ma means the beds can be tentatively correlated to the Sturtian glaciation, but they may represent the advance or retreat of a snowball Earth.|$|E
25|$|While over 100 {{manuscript}} 'constitutions' exist, documents detailing actual ritual {{are much}} rarer. The earliest, dating from 1696, is the Scottish Edinburgh Register House manuscript , which gives a catechism {{and a certain}} amount of ritual of the Entered Apprentice and a Fellow Craft ceremonies. It was named after the building in which it was discovered, which houses the Scottish National Archives. The Trinity College Manuscript, discovered in Dublin, Ireland, but which is clearly of Scottish origin, has been dated to c.1710, is substantially the same in content. The recently discovered Airlie MS dated 1705 is therefore the second oldest known Scottish stonemasons' rituals. Although referred to as rituals these manuscripts are also aide memoires, or 'prompt sheets'. They therefore have three functions but for ease of reference they are commonly described as 'rituals'. <b>The</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> three rituals lie in {{the fact that they are}} 1) of Scottish origin 2) are based on the ceremonies used by Scottish stonemasons and 3) that they pre-date the existence of any Grand Lodge (essentially a 'Head Office'). Collectively they are known as the 'Scottish School'.|$|E
25|$|Reliable {{projections}} for CNS risks from space radiation exposure cannot {{be made at}} this time due to a paucity of data on the subject. Existing animal and cellular data do suggest that space radiation can produce neurological and behavioral effects; therefore, {{it is possible that}} mission operations will be impacted. <b>The</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> results on the morbidity to astronauts has not been elucidated, however. It is to be noted that studies, to date, have been carried out with relatively small numbers of animals (<10 per dose group); this means that testing of dose threshold effects at lower doses (<0.5 Gy) has not yet been carried out to a sufficient extent. As the problem of extrapolating space radiation effects in animals to humans will be a challenge for space radiation research, such research could become limited by the population size that is typically used in animal studies. Furthermore, the role of dose protraction has not been studied to date. An approach has not been discovered to extrapolate existing observations to possible cognitive changes, performance degradation, or late CNS effects in astronauts. Research on new approaches to risk assessment may be needed to provide the data and knowledge that will be necessary to develop risk projection models of the CNS from space radiation. A vigorous research program, which will be required to solve these problems, must rely on new approaches to risk assessment and countermeasure validation because of the absence of useful human radio-epidemiology data in this area.|$|E

500|$|On 1 December 1989 the United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) {{activated}} as the 16th major Army command. These {{special operations}} forces have been America's spearhead for unconventional warfare for more than 40 years. USASOC commands such units as the well known Special Forces (SF, or the [...] "Green Berets") and the Rangers, and such relatively unknown units as the Psychological Operations Group (PSYOP) and Civil Affairs Brigade (CA).

500|$|Younger {{silky sharks}} {{are known to}} form large, loosely {{organized}} aggregations, possibly for mutual defense. During migrations, over a thousand individuals may gather. These groups are generally segregated by size, and in the Pacific perhaps also by sex. Silky sharks within a group have been observed to [...] "tilt", presenting their full lateral profile towards each other, as well as gape their jaws or puff out their gills. On occasion, sharks have also been seen suddenly charging straight up, veering away just before reaching the surface and gliding back down to deeper water. <b>The</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> behaviors is unknown. When confronted, the silky shark may perform a threat display, in which it arches its back, drops its tail and pectoral fins, and elevates its head. The shark then proceeds to swim in tight loops with a stiff, jerky motion, often turning broadside towards the perceived threat.|$|E
500|$|Fossas {{communicate}} using sounds, scents, {{and visual}} signals. Vocalizations include purring, a threatening call, and a call of fear, consisting of [...] "repeated loud, coarse inhalations and gasps of breath". A long, high yelp may function to attract other fossas. Females mew during mating and males produce a sigh {{when they have}} found a female. Throughout the year, animals produce long-lasting scent marks on rocks, trees, and the ground using glands in the anal region and on the chest. They also communicate using face and body expression, but <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> signals is uncertain. The animal is aggressive only during mating, and males in particular fight boldly. After a short fight, the loser flees and {{is followed by the}} winner for a short distance. In captivity, fossas are usually not aggressive and sometimes even allow themselves to be stroked by a zookeeper, but adult males in particular may try to bite.|$|E
