50|$|<b>The</b> lines joining <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{circles in}} Fig. 2 are {{perpendicular}} to the line segments AP, BQ and CR. For example, <b>the</b> line joining <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle containing ARB and <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle containing AQC, is {{perpendicular to the}} segment AP. So, <b>the</b> lines joining <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circles also intersect at 60° angles. Therefore <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circles form an equilateral triangle. This is known as Napoleon's Theorem.|$|R

Crossing over an ex-Erie Railroad line, the route intersects with Grand Street, where NY78 turns east off North Transit Street onto Grand. East on Grand Street, NY78 intersects with Clinton Street, where NY78 turns north. Passing northeast of Upson Park, NY78 continues northeast through Lockport on Clinton Street. The route becomes a two-lane residential street, passing Dolan Park and turning north on Lake Avenue.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the higher education programs, Unicamp is also responsible for running and funding two technical high schools, the Technical High School of Campinas (COTUCA) and the Technical High School of Limeira (COTIL). Cotuca was located for 50 years in a historical building near <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> built in 1918 which also housed Unicamp {{for a brief period}} before the current campus was built. In 2014 it was transferred to the main campus as the old building went through renovations. Both schools are amongst the best public high schools in the country, and are highly competitive, with admissions done through a selection exam open to middle-school students.|$|E
5|$|Nallur, {{the capital}} was built with four entrances with gates. There were two main roadways and four temples {{at the four}} gateways. The rebuilt temples that exist now do not match their {{original}} locations which instead are occupied by churches erected by the Portuguese. <b>The</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was Muthirai Santhai (market place) and {{was surrounded by a}} square fortification around it. There were courtly buildings for the Kings, Brahmin priests, soldiers and other service providers. The old Nallur Kandaswamy temple functioned as a defensive fort with high walls. In general, the city was laid out like the traditional temple town according to Hindu traditions.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to Chicago's skyscrapers {{began to}} grow during the late 1880s and early 1890s. Even before the {{development}} of the skyscraper, some criticized large buildings in Chicago for dominating churches and private houses, and this sentiment strengthened. Critics complained that the concentration of tall buildings in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was causing huge congestion, and each new skyscraper was also burning additional coal to power its facilities, together consuming a total of over one million tons each year, leaving smoke and stagnant air hanging over Chicago. Many were concerned over the risk of a major fire breaking out and spreading, uncontrolled, from building to building.|$|E
50|$|Tidally-locked {{bodies have}} a natural {{reference}} longitude passing through the point nearest to their parent body: 0° <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary-facing hemisphere, 90° <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leading hemisphere, 180° <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anti-primary hemisphere, and 270° <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trailing hemisphere.

The castle housed a garrison of 250 soldiers, and was the seat of government for the Province of Cumaná.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> {{contained}} several {{reinforced concrete}} buildings and lighter structures. Outside the center, {{the area was}} congested by a dense collection of small timber-made workshops set among Japanese houses. A few larger industrial plants lay near {{the outskirts of the}} city. The houses were constructed of timber with tile roofs, and many of the industrial buildings were also built around timber frames. The city as a whole was highly susceptible to fire damage.|$|E

5|$|During the 1800s, Nadars, then an {{aspiring}} business community, established their commercial {{base in the}} town. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, the Nadars’ rapid rise as a business community and pursuit for higher social status caused resentment in higher castes. The mutual confrontation between the Maravars and Nadars reached its peak in 1899, leading to a series of riots which became known as the Sivakasi riots. A total of 22 people were killed, as many as 800 houses and the Big Chariot in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> (used by the temple during festivals) were burnt during the riots. Eventually the riots came to an end after the intervention of the military in mid-July 1899.|$|E

5|$|Germany: The {{species is}} known from two {{different}} areas in the country. In 2005 and 2006, specimens were caught in an old moist forest near the Rhine in western Baden-Württemberg. Two other bats were found in highway tunnels close to this site. The species is also known from the Kyffhäuser hill range of Thuringia in central Germany, an island of relatively warm habitat with some unusual wildlife. There, bats were caught near a spring in a karst landscape amid oak-dominated deciduous forest. The species was also recorded in deciduous forest at a former Soviet military training site in eastern Thuringia. M.alcathoe has also been recorded in the nearby states of Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony, where it occurs in mixed deciduous forest. Many Saxony-Anhalt records are from near water. However, the species was also recorded in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Chemnitz in Saxony.|$|E
