25|$|Over {{the years}} {{there have been}} several {{attempts}} to replace Gerber by formats containing more information than just the layer image, e.g. netlist or component information. None of these attempts have been widely accepted within the electronics manufacturing industry, probably because the formats are complex. Gerber remains the most widely used data <b>transfer</b> <b>format.</b>|$|E
25|$|In June 2013, Ucamco {{published}} {{a proposal to}} add three new commands to the Gerber format which allow to include image attributes conveying metadata attached to the image and its components. It invited feedback from the Gerber users before committing these ideas to a firm specification. This process resulted in revision J1 from February 2014, updated with further revisions until revision 2015.07. Including metadata adds intelligence to the format. It converts a mere image description format to a fully-fledged PCB data <b>transfer</b> <b>format.</b> This is called the second extension and results {{what is known as}} Gerber X2, Gerber X1 being the pure image format. Gerber X2 is fully backward compatible with X1 - the attributes do not affect the image. Gerber X2 was developed by Karel Tavernier, Ludek Brukner and Thomas Weyn.|$|E

Those actions can be grouped into two categories: Device actions, {{that represent the}} actions sent directly to the devices; and Intermediary actions, that represent the actions sent to the devices through an Intermediary (a component that manages the communication between the user and the devices). Each category can be further decomposed into two subcategories: Set and Get actions.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{produced}} {{as part of}} a study (Shaw, 2006), to define the scope of, and assess the priorities for, the PropBase project. The PropBase project is intended to provide information on physical, mechanical, chemical and mineralogical properties of the UK’s rocks and soils, and their interrelationships to enable attribution of the 3 D geological model and modelling of the properties themselves, and to obtain {{a better understanding of how}} these properties change as a result of geological processes. This reports describes a review, undertaken between March and July 2006, of BGS datasets held and maintained specifically within Murchison House, that may be of potential relevance to PropBase. The report also considers issues related to the potential integration of these datasets, future capture of data, particularly in accepted industry-wide electronic data recording and <b>transfer</b> <b>formats</b> (e. g.

40|$|Translation {{agencies}} are introducing sta- tistical machine translation (SMT) {{into the work}} flow of human translators. Typ- ically, SMT produces a first-draft transla- tion, which is then post-edited by a per- son. SMT has met much resistance from translators, partly because of professional conservatism, but partly because the SMT community has often neglected some practical aspects of translation. Our paper discusses one of these: <b>transferring</b> <b>formatting</b> tags such as bold or italic from the source to the target document with a low error rate, thus freeing the post-editor from having to reformat SMT-generated text. In our 2 ̆ 01 ctwo-stream 2 ̆ 01 d approach, tags are stripped from the input to the decoder, then reinserted into the resulting target-language text. Tag trans- fer has been tackled by other SMT teams, {{but only a few}} have published descrip- tions of their work. This paper contrib- utes to understanding tag transfer by ex- plaining our approach in detail. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
