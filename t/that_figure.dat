5|$|An {{area was}} set aside within {{the grounds for}} athletics, aptly named the Tower Athletic Ground. It {{consisted}} of a stadium opened in 1896; the hope was to provide additional entertainment for visitors to the tower in the winter months. The capacity of the grounds varied, but at one point was as high as 100,000, although attendances rarely, if ever, approached <b>that</b> <b>figure.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{there were}} about 3,500 Christians of various {{denominations}} in Nablus, but <b>that</b> <b>figure</b> dwindled to about 650 in 2008. Of the Christian populace, there are seventy Orthodox Christian families, about thirty Catholic (Roman Catholic & Eastern Melkite Catholic) families and thirty Anglican families. Most Christians {{used to live in}} the suburb of Rafidia {{in the western part of}} the city.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, Texas' rushing {{offense was}} led by two running backs: Ricky Williams and Shon Mitchell. Together, they {{averaged}} 207 yards per game, good enough for No. 22 nationally. Mitchell started at running back and gained 1,099 rushing yards. Williams accumulated 990 rushing yards during the regular season. <b>That</b> <b>figure</b> was a record for Texas freshmen. Protecting Williams, Mitchell, and Brown was a successful offensive line led by All-America guard Dan Neil.|$|E

5|$|The 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl {{kicked off}} at 7:37 p.m. EST on December 31, 2009, in the Georgia Dome, Atlanta, Georgia. Bowl {{officials}} announced 73,777 people attended the game, but <b>that</b> <b>figure</b> {{was based on}} the number of tickets sold rather than actual turnstile attendance. That attendance figure was the fourth-largest in Chick-fil-A Bowl history, including when the game was known as the Peach Bowl, and it was the 13th consecutive sellout for the game. The game was broadcast in the United States by ESPN, and was watched by an estimated 4.87 million people, earning it a Nielsen Rating of 4.2. <b>That</b> <b>figure</b> was the 10th highest among bowl games that season, and was a 36 percent increase from the previous year's rating. The sportscasters for the broadcast were Sean McDonough, Matt Millen, and Holly Rowe. Because the game was played indoors, weather was not a factor.|$|E
5|$|The club's record home {{attendance}} is 23,002, for an FA Cup match against QPR on 10 January 1948, a record which {{will almost certainly}} never be broken unless the club relocates to a larger ground, given that Priestfield Stadium's current capacity is approximately half <b>that</b> <b>figure.</b>|$|E

The park entered the rolls of the Connecticut State Register and Manual in 1953, when it was listed at 84 acres, <b>that</b> <b>figure</b> expanding to 104 acres ten years later. The state added 91 acres through two separate purchases in 2001 and another 2.3 acres in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{pipeline}} {{also has}} had a human toll. Thirty-two Alyeska or contract workers were killed during the construction project. <b>That</b> <b>figure</b> does not include common carrier fatalities.

5|$|According to the Bills of Mortality, {{there were}} in total 68,596 deaths in London from the plague in 1665. Lord Clarendon {{estimated}} that the true number of mortalities was probably twice <b>that</b> <b>figure.</b> The next year, 1666, saw further deaths in other cities but on a lesser scale. Dr Thomas Gumble, chaplain to the Duke of Albermarle, both of whom had stayed in London {{for the whole of}} the epidemic, estimated that the total death count for the country from plague during 1665 and 1666 was about 200,000.|$|E

5|$|By 2000 the {{percentage}} of nuclear families had decreased by 40%, {{while the number of}} other family types had increased by 51%. The percentage of single households has also steadily increased. In 1970, only 17% of households consisted of singles. In 2000 <b>that</b> <b>figure</b> had increased by 50% with singles constituting 25.5% of households. The most drastic increase was among {{the percentage}} of households made up of single males, which nearly doubled from 5.6% in 1970 to 10.7% in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, total Scottish exports (excluding intra-UK trade) were {{estimated}} to be £27.5billion. Scotland's primary exports include whisky, electronics and financial services. The United States, Netherlands, Germany, France and Norway constitute the country's major export markets. Scotland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), including oil and gas produced in Scottish waters, was estimated at £150 billion for the calendar year 2012. If Scotland became independent, it would hold 95% of the UK's current oil and gas reserves if they were split geographically using a median line from the English-Scottish border. If the reserves were split by population, <b>that</b> <b>figure</b> would be reduced to 9%.|$|E
5|$|Linebacker Ben Taylor was the Hokies' {{defensive}} leader. He was No. 1 on {{the team}} in tackles with 103. <b>That</b> <b>figure</b> included 1.5 sacks. He also had two interceptions, five pass breakups, and one forced fumble. Four year starting linebacker Jake Houseright was the team's No. 2 tackler. He had 75, including five tackles for loss. He also had five pass breakups and recovered one fumble. Free safety Willie Pile, who was {{in his first year}} as a starter on the defense, was Tech's leading performer in pass coverage. He had six interceptions—the most {{on the team}}—broke up 10 passes, forced one fumble, and recovered one fumble.|$|E

5|$|Mobile phones {{have had}} a {{significant}} impact on telephone networks. Mobile phone subscriptions now outnumber fixed-line subscriptions in many markets. Sales of mobile phones in 2005 totalled 816.6 million with <b>that</b> <b>figure</b> being almost equally shared amongst the markets of Asia/Pacific (204 m), Western Europe (164 m), CEMEA (Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa) (153.5 m), North America (148 m) and Latin America (102 m). In terms of new subscriptions over the five years from 1999, Africa has outpaced other markets with 58.2% growth. Increasingly these phones are being serviced by systems where the voice content is transmitted digitally such as GSM or W-CDMA with many markets choosing to deprecate analog systems such as AMPS.|$|E
5|$|Other {{people from}} much further afield {{in the former}} British colonies have arrived since the 1950s: in particular, 6% {{of people living in}} England have family origins in the Indian subcontinent, mostly India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. 2.90% of the {{population}} are black, from Africa and the Caribbean, especially former British colonies. There is a significant number of Chinese and British Chinese. In 2007, 22% of primary school children in England were from ethnic minority families, and in 2011 <b>that</b> <b>figure</b> was 26.5%. About half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001 was due to immigration. Debate over immigration is politically prominent; according to a 2009 Home Office poll, 80% of people want to cap it. The ONS has projected that the population will grow by nine million between 2014 and 2039.|$|E
5|$|Passing {{through the}} hands of four owners during its troubled 23-year history, Nittany Furnace never {{fulfilled}} the expectations developed when it replaced the antiquated (charcoal) Bellefonte Furnace. It should arguably never have been built: {{by the time it}} went into blast in 1888, the price per ton of iron had already been driven below $22, a historic low, and it would almost never rise above <b>that</b> <b>figure</b> until the onset of World War I. The sprawling steel works of Pittsburgh, fed by Mesabi Range ore, could produce iron more cheaply than the furnaces at Bellefonte ever could. The principal advantage of a Bellefonte location — proximity to local ore deposits — was negated by the availability of easily mined, high-grade Mesabi ore, hauled by rail.|$|E

5|$|Since {{moving to}} the City of Manchester Stadium, Manchester City's average attendances {{have been in the}} top six in England, usually in excess of 40,000. Even in the late 1990s, when the club were relegated twice in three seasons and playing in the third tier of English {{football}} (then Division Two, now Football League One), home attendances were in the region of 30,000, compared to an average for the division of fewer than 8,000. Research carried out by Manchester City in 2005 estimates a fanbase of 886,000 in the United Kingdom and a total in excess of 2 million worldwide, although since the purchase of the club by Sheikh Mansour and the club's recent trophies, <b>that</b> <b>figure</b> has ballooned to many times that size.|$|E
5|$|Texas scored {{first when}} Selvin Young ran {{the ball in}} for a touchdown. The extra point attempt by Richmond McGee was no good. The Cajuns were able to score threepoints on a field goal by Sean Comiskey making the score Texas 6, Louisiana Lafayette 3. Texas replied with 54unanswered points {{to win the game}} 60–3. With the win, Texas {{improved}} its record in season-opening games to 93–17–3 and 72–2–2 when they open the year at home. <b>That</b> <b>figure</b> includes 11straight wins and victories in 30of their last 31games at home.
