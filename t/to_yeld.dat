Entretanto, o cultivo enfrenta diversos problemas na produção e qualidade de frutos causados por, entre outros fatores, fitopatógenos e a falta de materiais superiores. Nesse sentido, o presente trabalho teve por objetivo avaliar a produtividade, qualidade de frutos e a resistência de progênies de maracujazeiro azedo a virose do endurecimento dos frutos (Cowpea aphid-borne mosaic vírus-CABMV) e verrugose (Cladosporium sp.) bem como estimar parâmetros genéticos que qualificam a influência genética e {{ambiental}} nos caracteres propiciando fonte de estratégias de melhoramento genético. O experimento foi realizado na Fazenda Água Lima, utilizando o delineamento experimental em blocos casualizados, com 32 tratamentos (progênies) e quatro repetições, sendo a parcela útil constituída por oito plantas. As progênies avaliadas foram: PLANTA 6, MAR 20 # 40, PLANTA 1, MAR 20 # 29, MAR 22 # 2005, ROXO AUSTRALIANO, MAR 20 # 15, MSC, RC 3, RUBI GIGANTE, ARO 1, ARO 2, MAR 20 # 49, BRS SOL DO CERRADO, MAR 20 # 06, PLANTA 5, MAR 20 # 23, PLANTA 4, PLANTA 2, PLANTA 7, MAR 20 # 03, EC 30, MAR 20 # 10, MAR 20 # 34, MAR 20 # 21, FB 200, FP 01, BRS GIGANTE AMARELO, EC-RAM, GA 2, REDONDÃO e MAR 20 # 39. Em campo, foram realizadas 20 colheitas em que se determinou produtividade e número de frutos por hectare, massa média dos frutos (g); classificação dos frutos em cinco classes (primeira, 1 B, 1 A, 2 A e 3 A) de acordo com o diâmetro equatorial. Os resultados para o desempenho agronômico mostraram na avaliação geral que houve uma maior produtividade estimada e quantidade de frutos da progênie MAR 20 # 23 (15. 474 kg/ha), acima da média nacional, a qual também obteve maior rendimento para frutos 1 B. BRS Gigante Amarelo foi a progênie mais produtiva para frutos de primeira (3. 343 kg/ha; 53. 939 fruto/ha) e AR 01 se destacou entre os frutos classe 2 A (17. 094 frutos/ha; 3. 706 kg/ha), ideais para consumo in natura. A maior massa média total por fruto foi obtida pela MSC (155 g). Para produtividade total estimada observou-se valor de herdabilidade (ha 2) de 65 %, com razão CVg/CVe de 0, 68, 71 % para número total de frutos, com razão CVg/CVe de 0, 78, e número de frutos de primeira com ha 2 = 81 %. A razão CVg/CVe foi menor que 1 para a maioria das variáveis resposta. Para avaliação da reação das progênies quanto às doenças, foram feitas avaliações em frutos para cladosporiose e em folhas para virose, considerando incidência, severidade da doença e porcentagem de plantas resistentes. Todas foram viii classificadas como moderadamente resistentes a virose, sendo que Planta 4 apresentou baixos valores de severidade e incidência e maior porcentagem de plantas resistentes. A herdabilidade para severidade, incidência e porcentagem de plantas resistentes a virose foi: 55 %, 37 % e 47 % respectivamente. Observou-se que a razão CVg/CVe foi menor que 1 para todas as características avaliadas. Quanto a verrugose, a progênie Planta 2 foi considerada moderadamente suscetível. As herdabilidades da severidade e da incidência resultaram em 51 % e 57 % respectivamente. Por sua vez, a razão (CVg/CVe) foi menor que 1 para todas as características avaliadas. Nesse sentido, os materiais genéticos mostraram consideráveis perspectivas para serem usados em futuros cruzamentos, dando continuidade à pesquisa de melhoramento genético do maracujazeiro visando produtividade e resistência a doenças. _______________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTAmong {{the fruits}} produced, passionfruit is potentialy growing in Brazil. However, the crop faces several problems in production and fruit quality caused by pathogens {{and the absence}} of superior materials. In this context, the present work was carried out to evaluate the productivity, fruit quality and resistance of progenies to Passionfruit woodiness virus (Cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus-CABMV) and to scab (Cladosporium sp.), as well to estimate parameters which qualify the genetic and environmental influence on genetic characters providing a source of genetic improvement strategies. The experiment was conducted at Água Limpa Farm, using randomized block experimental design with 32 treatments (progenies) and four replications, and the useful portion consists of eight plants. The progenies were: PLANTA 6, MAR 20 # 40, PLANTA 1, MAR 20 # 29, MAR 22 # 2005, ROXO AUSTRALIANO, MAR 20 # 15, MSC, RC 3, RUBI GIGANTE, ARO 1, ARO 2, MAR 20 # 49, BRS SOL DO CERRADO, MAR 20 # 06, PLANTA Among the fruits produced, passionfruit is potentialy growing in Brazil.

In the field, during 20 evaluations, it was determined productivity and number of fruits per hectare, the average mass of fruits (g) and classification of fruits into 5 types (first, 1 B, 1 A, 2 A and 3 A) in accordance to equatorial diameter. The results for agronomic performance showed that there was a higher estimated productivity and quantity of fruit in the progeny MAR 20 # 23 (15, 474 kg/ha), over the national average, which also had higher yield for fruits 1 B. BRS Gigante Amarelo was the most productive progeny in first fruits type (3343 kg/ha, 53, 939 fruit/ha) and AR 01 distinguished itself for 2 A fruits type (17, 094 fruits/ha, 3, 706 kg/ha), ideal for in natura consumption. The higher total average mass per fruit was obtained by the MSC (155 g). In order to estimate total productivity there was observed value of inheritability (ha 2) of 65 %, with reason CVg/CVe of 0. 68, 71 % for total number of fruits, reason CVg/CVe 0. 78, and number of fruits first type with ha 2 = 81 %. The reason CVg/CVe was less than 1 for most response variables. To estimate the progenies reaction to diseases, were evaluated scab symptoms in fruits and virus symptoms in leaves, considering the incidence, disease severity and percentage of resistant plants. All were classified as moderately resistant to virus, which Plant 4 had low levels of severity and incidence, and higher percentage of resistant plants. Inheritability for severity, incidence and percentage of plants resistant to viral infection was 55 %, 37 % and 47 % respectively. It was observed that the reason CVg/CVe was less than 1 for all traits. To scab, progeny Plant 2 was considered moderately susceptible. Inheritability of the incidence and severity resulted in 51 % and 57 % respectively. In turn, the reason (CVg/CVe) was less than 1 for all traits. In this sense, genetic materials showed considerable prospects for use in future crosses, continuing the search for plant breeding in order <b>to</b> <b>yeld</b> and passion fruit disease resistance...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays natural {{products}} interest has increased. However, when some products are included on textile fibers, {{they have no}} affinity and need some binders or other kind of auxiliaries <b>to</b> improve the <b>yeld</b> of the process, {{and some of them}} are not so natural as the product which are binding and consequently the “bio” definition is missed as some of them can be considered as highly pollutant. Chitosan is a common used bonding agent for cotton. It improves the antimicrobial and antifungal activity, improves wound healing and is a non-toxic bonding agent. The biopolymer used in this work is chitosan, which is a deacetylated derivative of chitin. These properties depend on the amount of deacetylation (DD) and the Molecular weight (MW). Along with these improving properties, as it requires some acid pH to ve solved the treatment with chitosan can have some decreasing mechanical properties. The aim of that paper is to evaluate the change in breaking force of the treated samples and a change in elongation of those samples.

2500|$|The era of Industrial Revolution weaving {{machinery}} {{gave rise}} to technological jargon {{in places such as}} Yorkshire with a strong local dialect. [...] The resultant inscrutability of linguistic terms has given rise to such jokes as the one from Monty Python's Trouble at Mill sketch: One on't cross beams gone owt askew on treadle. This nonsense may have been written so on the script as a joke, but what Graham Chapman could have said correctly in dialect is, [...] "One o't crossbeams 'as gone out o' skew on't treadle", meaning [...] "One of the crossbeams has gone askew on the treadle". The treadle was a rocking pedal, powered by the worker's foot. [...] The treadle in turn powered a reciprocating beam, and the power from that was transferred to the machinery. On a loom, these reciprocating beams were called lams, and were connected with the treadles by strings which were also connected with jacks <b>to</b> work the <b>yelds.</b> [...] In big factories, power could be transferred from one large drive wheel to another across a wide room via a reciprocating beam, called in that situation a crossbeam.

In order to identify and characterise streams as relics of the Milky Way formation, we start with classifying, select, and study 2417 subdwarfs with [Fe/H] < - 1. 5 up to 3 kpc away from the Sun as tracers of the local halo system. Then, through phase-space analysis, we find statistical evidence of five discrete kinematic overdensities among 67 of the fastest-moving stars, and compare them to high-resolution N-body simulations of the interaction between a Milky-Way like galaxy and orbiting dwarf galaxies with four representative cases of merging histories. The observed overdensities can be interpreted as fossil substructures consisting of streamers torn from their progenitors, such progenitors appear to be satellites on prograde and retrograde orbits on different inclinations. In particular, of the five detected overdensities, two appear <b>to</b> be associated, <b>yelding</b> twenty-one additional main-sequence members, with the stream of Helmi et al.

(2007), whatever their origin, the progenitor(s) would be on retrograde orbit(s) and inclination(s) within the range 10 ^∘ 60 ^∘.

Objetivou-se com este trabalho avaliar a redução na produtividadedevida à redução artificial da área foliar da cv. Pérola nas condições de Rio Branco, AC. O experimento foi conduzido no campo experimental da Embrapa Acre, em delineamento de blocos casualizados, com quatro repetições e esquema experimental de parcelas subdivididas, estudando-se nas parcelas cinco das etapas de desenvolvimento da planta (V 3 = primeira folha trifoliolada, V 4 = terceira folha trifoliolada, R 6 = floração, R 7 = formação de vagens e R 8 = enchimento de vagens) e nas subparcelas, quatro níveis de desfolhamento (0 %, 33 %, 66 % e 100 %). Foram avaliadas, em média, 480 plantas nas 4 linhas centrais de cada subparcela, determinando-se o número de vagens por planta, o número de grãos por vagem e a produtividade de grãos. Paralelamente, em uma área adjacente, foram colhidas, ao acaso, 50 plantas de cada etapa de desenvolvimento para a obtenção da área foliar média. Nas etapas de desenvolvimento V 3, V 4 e R 7, níveis de desfolhamento a partir de 33 % causaram decréscimo no número de vagens por planta. O número de sementes por vagem não sofreu influência dos níveis de desfolhamento das plantas. O rendimento dos grãos foi significativamente reduzido à medida que as plantas foram submetidas a níveis crescentes de desfolha. A etapa de florescimento (R 6) foi a que apresentou maior redução na produtividade como resposta à desfolha.

The experiment was conducted at the Experimental Station of Embrapa Acre. The experiment was arranged as a split-plot in a randomized block design, with four replications. The main plots consisted of five plant development stages: V 3 = first trifoliate leaf, V 4 = third trifoliate leaf, R 6 = initiation of flowering, R 7 = pod formation and R 8 = pod maturation, and the sub-plots were the four defoliation levels (0 %, 33 %, 66 % and 100 %). At harvest an average of 480 plants of the four central lines of each sub-plot were evaluated. It was determined the number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod and yeld (kg/ha). In order to determine the average leaf area, 50 plants were randomily harvested in each development stage. The results demonstrated that defoliation levels starting from 33 %, in the stages V 3, V 4 and R 7, reduced the number of pods per plant. The number of seeds per pod was not affected by the level of defoliation of the plants. The seed weight was significantly reduced as the plants were submitted to increasing levels of defoliation.

In a second step, {{this paper presents}} a simple and accessible novel synthetic route, for the preparation {{of a series of}} 30 unpublished 1, 6 - disubstituted 4 -trifluoromethyl-pyridin- 2 (1 H) -imines (14 - 19) from the condensation reaction of 5 -aryl- 3 -trifluoromethyl- 5 -methoxy-penta- 2, 4 - dienenitriles (Ar = Ph, 4 -F-C 6 H 4, 4 -Br-C 6 H 4, 4 -Me-C 6 H 4 and 4 -MeO-C 6 H 4) (5) with primary amines R-NH 2 (R = Bu, 2 -(1 -cyclehexenil) ethyl, 2 -(4 - morpholinyl) ethyl, 2 -phenethyl-ethyl, 2 -(4 -chlorophenethyl) ethyl and 2 -(4 - methoxyphenethyl) ethyl) (8 - 13), in a solvent free sealed system to give the expected products with yields between 20 to 98 %. In addition, a series of new 6 -substituted 4 -trifluoromethyl- 2 H-pyran- 2 - ones (20) was obtained in 88 <b>to</b> 100 % <b>yeld,</b> from the autocondensation reaction of 5 -aryl- 3 -trifluoromethyl- 5 -methoxy-penta- 2, 4 -dienenitriles (Ar = Ph, 4 -F-C 6 H 4, 4 -Br-C 6 H 4, 4 -Me-C 6 H 4 and 4 -MeO-C 6 H 4) (5), in a reflux system using water as solvent in the presence of HCl and 1 equivalent of ZnBr 2. The pyridinimines, pyranones and dienes obtained in this work were identified and characterized by Hydrogen Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (H 1 NMR), Carbon- 13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (C 13 NMR), Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS-EI), High Resolution Mass Spectroscopy (HRMS-ESI) and Elemental Analysis...|$|R
