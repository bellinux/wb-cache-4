40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of CSN 2 -CSN 3 (beta-kappa-casein) haplotypes and BLG (beta-lactoglobulin) genotypes on milk production traits, content of protein fractions, and detailed protein composition of individual milk of Simmental cows. Content of the major protein fractions was measured by reversed-phase HPLC in individual milk samples of 2, 167 cows. Protein composition was measured as percentage of each casein (CN) fraction to total CN and as percentage of beta-lactoglobulin (beta-LG) to <b>total</b> <b>whey</b> protein. Genotypes at CSN 2, CSN 3, and BLG were ascertained by reversed-phase HPLC, and CSN 2 -CSN 3 haplotype probabilities were estimated for each cow. Traits were analyzed by using a linear model including the fixed effects of herd-test-day, parity, days in milk, and somatic cell score class, linear regressions on haplotype probabilities, class of BLG genotype, and the random effect of the sire of the cow. Effects of haplotypes and BLG genotypes on yields were weak or trivial. Genotype BB at BLG and haplotypes carrying CSN 2 B and CSN 3 B were associated with increased CN content and CN number. Haplotypes including CSN 3 B were associated with increased kappa-CN content and percentage of kappa-CN to total CN and with decreased percentages of alpha(S 1) - and gamma-CN to total CN. Allele CSN 2 B had the effect of increasing beta-CN content and decreasing content of alpha(S 1) -CN. Haplotypes including allele CSN 2 A(1) exhibited decreased beta-, alpha(S 2) -, and gamma-CN concentrations and increased alpha(S 1) - and kappa-CN contents, whereas CSN 2 I had positive effects on beta-CN concentration and trivial effects on content of other protein fractions. Effects of haplotypes on CN composition were similar to those exerted on content of CN fractions. Allele BLG A was associated with increased beta-LG concentration and percentage of beta-LG to <b>total</b> <b>whey</b> protein and with decreased content of other milk proteins, namely beta-CN and alpha(S 1) -CN. Estimated additive genetic variance for investigated traits ranged from 14 to 39 % of total variance.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the rheological behaviour of Ca 2 +-induced cold-set gels of whey protein mixtures. Coldset gels are important applications for products with a low thermal stability. In previous work [1], we determined the state diagram for whey protein mixtures that were heated for 10 h at pH 2 at 80 °C. Under these conditions, the major whey protein, ß-lactoglobulin (ß-lg), forms fibrils. When whey protein mixtures are heated at protein concentrations in the liquid solution regime of the state diagram, cold-set gels can be formed by adding Ca 2 + ions at pH 7. We studied the rheological behaviour of cold-set gels for various sample compositions for whey protein mixtures. When keeping the <b>total</b> <b>whey</b> protein concentration constant, the elastic modulus, G¿, for the cold-set gels decreased for increasing a-lactalbumin and bovine serum albumin ratios, because less material (blg fibrils) was available to form a gel network. In the cold-set gels the interactions between the ß-lg fibrils induced by the calcium ions are dominant. The ß-lg fibrils are forming the cold-set gel network and therefore determine the gel strength. a-Lactalbumin and bovine serum albumin are not incorporated in the stress-bearing structure of the gel...|$|E

Total solids, <b>total</b> protein, <b>whey</b> proteins, fat, lactose and ash contents were determined. Macro- and micro-elements, IgG, IgM, IGF- 1, lactoferrin and vitamins (A and E) were also estimated. Results At calving, the <b>total</b> protein and <b>whey</b> proteins concentration {{did not differ}} between buffalo and cow colostrum, while total solids, fat, lactose and ash concentrations were higher in buffalo than in cow colostrum. All components decreased gradually as the transition period advanced except lactose which conversely increased. On the fifth day post-partum, concentration of <b>total</b> protein, <b>whey</b> proteins, fat, ash and total solids decreased by 69. 39, 91. 53, 36. 91, 45. 58 and 43. 85 % for buffalo and by 75. 99, 94. 12, 53. 36, 33. 59 and 52. 26 % for cow colostrum. However, lactose concentration increased by 42. 45 % for buffalo and 57. 39 % for cow colostrum. The macro-and micro-elements concentration of both colostrums tended to decline slightly toward normality {{on the fifth day}} of parturition. Buffalo colostrum had a higher concentration of vitamin E than cow colostrum during the experimental period. At calving, the concentration of vitamin A in buffalo colostrum was found to be approximately 1. 50 times lower than in cow colostrum. The concentrations of IgG, IgM, IGF- 1 and lactoferrin decreased by 97. 90, 97. 50, 96. 25 and 96. 70 % for buffalo and 76. 96, 74. 92, 76. 00 and 77. 44 % for cow colostrum, respectively after five days of parturition. Conclusions There is a dramatic change in buffalo and cow colostrum composition from the first milking until the fifth day of parturition. There are differences between buffalo and cow colostrum composition during the five days after calving. The composition of both colostrums approaches to those of normal milk within five days after parturition. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of milk beta-lactoglobulin phenotype {{on the content}} of fat, <b>total</b> protein, <b>whey</b> protein, casein, and fatty acids of 163 individual milk samples from Massese ewes was determined. Sampling was conducted randomly on five dairy ewe farms located in the area of origin of the Massese breed (North-West Tuscany, Italy). Three beta-lactoglobulin phenotypes were detected: their frequencies were AA 20. 25 %, AB 63. 80 % and BB 15. 95 %, respectively. In agreement with previous studies, parameters of milk gross composition were not significantly related with milk beta-lactoglobulin polymorphism. We demonstrate, for the first time, a significant relationship between beta-lactoglobulin phenotypes and milk fatty acid composition in ewes. The study highlighted a co-dominant effect of beta-lactoglobulin alleles on the concentration of some milk fatty acids, particularly for trans fatty acid content, that was higher in milk from heterozygous sheep.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the ability of mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) to predict protein fraction contents of bovine milk samples by applying uninformative variable elimination (UVE) procedure to select the most informative wavenumber variables before partial least squares (PLS) analysis. Reference values (n = 114) of protein fractions were measured using reversed-phase HPLC and spectra were acquired through MilkoScan FT 6000 (Foss Electric A/S, Hillerød, Denmark). Prediction models were built using the full data set and tested with a leave-one-out cross-validation. Compared with MIRS models developed using standard PLS, the UVE procedure reduced the number of wavenumber variables to be analyzed through PLS regression and improved the accuracy of prediction by 6. 0 to 66. 7 %. Good predictions were obtained for total protein, total casein (CN), and α-CN, which included αS 1 - and αS 2 -CN; moderately accurate predictions were observed for κ-CN and <b>total</b> <b>whey</b> protein; and unsatisfactory results were obtained for β-CN, α-lactalbumin, and β-lactoglobulin.

40|$|It {{is shown}} by starch-gel {{electrophoresis}} of samples of skim milk from individual ewes that the {{major part of the}} whey proteins migrates in three regions at pH 7. 6 (phosphate buffer, I 0. 2). In the region of highest mobility there is only one band and it represents serum albumin. The second region contains only one band and it corresponds to α-lactalbumin. In the third region there may be one or two bands, each of which is a genetic variant of β-lactoglobulin. These conclusions are confirmed by electrophoretic and immunological studies of <b>total</b> <b>whey</b> protein solutions and fractions isolated therefrom. The faster-moving β-lactoglobulin at pH 7. 6 is designated ovine β-lactoglobulin A and the slower one ovine β-lactoglobulin B. Their isolation and properties are described. The A variant can be crystallized readily at pH 5. 2. Attempts to crystallize the B variant have failed. Neither variant associates at pH 4. 6 and low temperature, thus resembling the bovine B and C variants rather than the bovine A variant.

Objective: This study {{examined the relationship between}} breast milk macronutrient concentration and patterns of milk intake in breastfeeding infants over a 24 -hour breastfeeding period. Methods: Mothers of healthy term infants (n = 15) collected pre- and postfeed breast milk samples from each feed at each breast over a 24 -hour period. Breast milk samples were analyzed for fat, lactose, total protein, casein, and whey protein content. The energy content for each feed was calculated. Results: Breastfeeding patterns and milk composition varied greatly between individuals. The fat content of milk significantly differed over 24 hours (P =. 01), whereas the concentration of lactose and protein content remained the same. The mean 24 -hour <b>total</b> protein, <b>whey,</b> and casein intake was inversely (P 3 ̆c. 01), whereas lactose concentration was positively (P =. 03) related to the number of breast feeds per day.

Conversely, contents of αS 1 -CN, γ-CN, glycosylated-κ-CN, total κ-CN, and whey protein fractions were predicted with poor accuracy (1 - VR < 0. 51). When protein fractions were expressed as percentages to total protein, 1 - VR values were never greater than 0. 61 (β-CN). Only 56 and 70 % of the observations were correctly classified by discriminant analysis in each of 2 groups of CSN 1 S 1 and CSN 3 genotypes, respectively. Results showed that FT-MIR spectroscopy is not applicable when prediction of detailed milk protein composition with high accuracy is required.

This stud y was conducted to determine the ratio between ortho- and the more soluble organic P forms in freshly produced cheese whe y, and to determine ortho- and organic P concentrations by depth within calcareous and sodic soils within {{one to two years}} of different whey rates and time of the year applications. Applications of up to 1050 kg P ha- 1 in acid whey were applied to a sodic soil (in green house lysimeters) and up to 750 kg P ha- 1 in sweet whey were applied to calcareous soils (field plots). Bicarbonate-extractable ortho-P did not move below 0. 3 m in the sodic Freedom silt loam (fine-silt y, mixed, mesic, Xerollic Calciorthid) soil by the end of one growing season. Neither bicarbonate-extractable nor saturation extract ortho- or organic P moved below 0. 6 m in the calcareous Portneuf silt loam (coarse-silty, mixed, mesic, Durixerollic Calciorthid) soil after three growing seasons or below 0. 3 m in the calcareous Nibley silty clay loam (fine, mixed, mesic Aquic Argiustolls) soil after two growing seasons.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to identify the factors associated with both the protein composition and free amino acid (FAA) composition of bovine milk predicted using mid-infrared spectroscopy. Milk samples were available from 7 research herds and 69 commercial herds. The spectral data from the research herds comprised 94, 286 separate morning and evening milk samples; the spectral data from the commercial herds comprised 40, 260 milk samples representing a composite sample of both the morning and evening milkings. Mid-infrared spectroscopy prediction models developed in a previous study were applied to all spectra. Factors associated with the predicted protein and FAA composition were quantified using linear mixed models. Factors considered in the model included the fixed effects of calendar month of the test, milking time (i. e., morning, evening, or both combined), parity (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and ≥ 6), stage of lactation, the interaction between parity and stage of lactation, breed proportion of the cow (Friesian, Jersey, Norwegian Red, Montbeliarde, and other), and both the general heterosis and recombination coefficients of the cow. Contemporary group as well as both within- and across-lactation permanent environmental effects were included in all models as random effects. Total proteins (i. e., total casein, CN; total whey; and total β-lactoglobulin) and protein fractions (with the exception of α-lactalbumin) decreased postcalving until 36 to 65 days in milk and increased thereafter. After adjusting the statistical model for differences in crude protein content and milk yield separately, irrespective of stage of lactation, younger animals produced more total proteins (i. e., total CN, <b>total</b> <b>whey,</b> and total β-lactoglobulin) as well as more total FAA, Glu, and Asp than their older contemporaries. The concentration of all protein fractions (except β-CN) in milk was greatest in the evening milk, even after adjusting for differences in the crude protein content of the milk. Relative to a purebred Holstein cow, Jersey cows, on average, produced a greater concentration of all CN fractions but less total FAA, Glu, Gly, Asp, and Val in milk.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of mid-infrared spectroscopy in predicting milk protein and free amino acid (FAA) composition in bovine milk. Milk samples were collected from 7 Irish research herds and represented cows from a range of breeds, parities, and stages of lactation. Mid-infrared spectral data in the range of 900 to 5, 000 cm(- 1) were available for 730 milk samples; gold standard methods were used to quantify individual protein fractions and FAA of these samples with a view to predicting these gold standard protein fractions and FAA levels with available mid-infrared spectroscopy data. Separate prediction equations were developed for each trait using partial least squares regression; accuracy of prediction was assessed using both cross validation on a calibration data set (n = 400 to 591 samples) and external validation on an independent data set (n = 143 to 294 samples). The accuracy of prediction in external validation was the same irrespective of whether undertaken on the entire external validation data set or just within the Holstein-Friesian breed. The strongest coefficient of correlation obtained for protein fractions in external validation was 0. 74, 0. 69, and 0. 67 for total casein, total beta-lactoglobulin, and beta-casein, respectively. Total proteins (i. e., total casein, <b>total</b> <b>whey,</b> and total lactoglobulin) were predicted with greater accuracy then their respective component traits; prediction accuracy using the infrared spectrum was superior to prediction using just milk protein concentration. Weak to moderate prediction accuracies were observed for FAA. The greatest coefficient of correlation in both cross validation and external validation was for Gly (0. 75), indicating a moderate accuracy of prediction. Overall, the FAA prediction models overpredicted the gold standard values. Near-unity correlations existed between total casein and beta-casein irrespective of whether the traits were based on the gold standard (0. 92) or mid-infrared spectroscopy predictions (0. 95). Weaker correlations among FAA were observed than the correlations among the protein fractions. Pearson correlations between gold standard protein fractions and the milk processing characteristics of rennet coagulation time, curd firming time, curd firmness, heat coagulating time, pH, and casein micelle size were weak to moderate and ranged from - 0. 48 (protein and pH) to 0. 50 (total casein and a(30)). Pearson correlations between gold standard FAA and these milk processing characteristics were also weak to moderate and ranged from - 0. 60 (Val and pH) to 0. 49 (Val and K- 20). Results from this study indicate that mid-infrared spectroscopy has the potential to predict protein fractions and some FAA in milk at a population level...|$|E
40|$|Functional RNAs, such as microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA, {{are present}} in milk, but their roles are unknown. To clarify the roles of milk RNAs, further studies using {{experimental}} animals such as rats are needed. However, {{it is unclear whether}} rat milk also contains functional RNAs and what their time dependent expression profiles are. Thus, we prepared <b>total</b> RNA from <b>whey</b> isolated from rat milk collected on days 2, 9, and 16 postpartum and analyzed using microarrays and quantitative PCR. The concentration of RNA in colostrum whey (day 2) was markedly higher than that in mature milk whey (days 9 and 16). Microarray analysis detected 161 miRNAs and 10, 948 mRNA transcripts. Most of the miRNAs and mRNA transcripts were common to all tested milks. Finally, we selected some immune- and development-related miRNAs and mRNAs, and analysed them by quantitative PCR (in equal sample volumes) to determine their time-dependent changes in expression in detail. Some were significantly more highly expressed in colostrum whey than in mature milk whey, but some were expressed equally. And mRNA expression levels of some cytokines and hormones did not reflect the protein levels. It is still unknown whether RNAs in milk play biological roles in neonates. However, our data will help guide future in vivo studies using experimental animals such as rats...|$|R
40|$|Compared to cow milk, the {{knowledge}} concerning the physico-chemical characteristics of camel milk is poor and only few publications reported {{these types of}} informations. Moreover, data are sometimes confuse and discordant between studies. Explanations concerning these discordances are differences in the geographical origin of camel milk and analytical methods used for the characterization. The objective {{of this study was}} to describe precisely the physico-chemical characteristics of fresh raw whole camel milk obtained from the Camel and Range Research Center located at Al-Jouf, Sakaka (Saudi Arabia). The collected milk came from 16 milking camels. The recovered volume, corresponding to two milking, was 150 liters. One liter of raw milk was sampled for the physico-chemical characterization. This milk was pasteurized at 70 °C during 10 minutes and one liter was also sampled for the same physico-chemical analyses. Experiments were performed in duplicate. The analyses were performed to (1) Determine the global composition of this milk (<b>total</b> and <b>whey</b> proteins, main minerals, lactose and fat); (2) Identity of the main proteins by mass spectrometry previously separated by reversed phase chromatography (3) Characterize the micellar properties of casein micelle in terms of mineralization, size, charge and hydration. For raw milk, the concentrations of dry matter, fat, lactose, total nitrogen, non casein nitrogen, Ca, inorganic phosphate, Mg, Na, K, Cl and citrate were 110, 25. 5, 49, 29, 9. 6, 1. 23, 1. 52, 0. 09, 1. 07, 1. 71, 1. 54 and 1. 67 g/kg. The chromatographic profiles of the main proteins were complex but the different caseins molecules were identified. No -lactoglobulin was detected. Different molecular masses were also determined without identify precisely the corresponding proteins. Concerning the micellar characteristics, the zeta potential was about - 15. 5 mV, the hydration 1. 70 g of water per g of dry pellet of ultracentrifugation and the average size of about 250 nm. These micelles contained Ca and inorganic phosphate with 0. 04 and 0. 04 g of these ions/g of casein. The mass ratio of micellar Ca/Pi was close to 1. 0. All these parameters were not significantly affected by the pasteurization...|$|R
40|$|The dairy {{industry}} requires raw milk {{of high quality}} {{in order to produce}} milk products of high quality and quantity. Mastitis {{is one of the most}} prevalent and economically important production diseases in dairy cattle. It causes increased somatic cell count (SCC), deteriorated milk composition and consequently altered processing properties of milk. Altered milk composition due to mastitis often occurs in only one of the four udder quarters of the cow. Milk with high SCC and deteriorated milk composition can be excluded at cow level. A future option will be to detect and exclude milk at udder quarter level, which can be achieved in automatic milking (AM) systems. This thesis examined alterations in milk composition in individual udder quarters in relation to elevated SCC. The studies were mainly carried out on Swedish Red Breed cows with low to moderate SCC, all supplying milk to a commercial dairy. It was found that around 30 % of the cows with low cow composite SCC (below 100 000 cells/ml) had one or more udder quarters with elevated SCC and altered milk composition. Furthermore, individual udder quarters with deteriorated milk composition and signs of reduced blood-milk barrier were found in cows with low to moderate levels of composite SCC. In addition, cows with elevated SCC had one or more udder quarters with low SCC and unaffected milk composition. It was also observed that the relative day-to-day variation in milk components in the four udder quarters of a healthy cow is similar, which suggests that using repeated measurements of milk composition at udder quarter level could be a suitable tool for detecting alterations in milk composition and health. Milk composition was affected by duration of storage and content of bacteria, as well as SCC. Separating the milk from individual udder quarters was shown to affect the content of <b>total</b> protein, <b>whey</b> protein and lactose at cow level. The main conclusions from this thesis are that individual udder quarters with deteriorated milk composition can be found in cows with fairly low SCC, and that exclusion of the milk from these udder quarters can improve overall milk quality. These results are important when discussing whether exclusion of some milk at udder quarter level should be introduced to improve milk quality...|$|R
40|$|Whey protein {{fractionation}} is {{an important}} industrial process that requires effective large-scale processes. Although packed bed chromatography has been used extensively, it suffers from low processing rates due to high back-pressures generated at high flow rates. Batch chromatography has been applied but generally has a low efficiency. More recently, adsorptive membranes have shown great promise for large-scale protein purification, particularly from large-volume dilute feedstocks. A new method for producing versatile adsorptive membranes by combining membrane and chromatographic resin matrices has been developed but not previously applied to whey protein fractionation. In this work, a series of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) were developed for membrane chromatography using ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVAL) based membranes and various types of adsorbent resin. The feasibility of MMM was tested in bovine whey protein fractionation processes. Flat sheet anion exchange MMMs were cast using EVAL and crushed Lewatit® MP 500 (Lanxess, Leverkusen, Germany) anion resin, expected to bind the acidic whey proteins β-lactoglobulin (β-Lac), α-lactalbumin (α-Lac) and bovine serum albumin (BSA). The MMM showed a static binding capacity of 120 mg β-Lac g⁻¹ membrane (36 mg β-Lac mL⁻¹ membrane) and 90 mg α-Lac g⁻¹ membrane (27 mg α-Lac mL⁻¹ membrane). It had a selective binding towards β-Lac in whey with a binding preference order of β-Lac > BSA > α-Lac. In batch whey fractionation, average binding capacities of 75. 6 mg β-Lac g⁻¹ membrane, 3. 5 mg α-Lac g⁻¹ membrane and 0. 5 mg BSA g⁻¹ membrane were achieved with a β-Lac elution recovery of around 80 %. Crushed SP Sepharose™ Fast Flow (GE Healthcare Technologies, Uppsala, Sweden) resin {{was used as an}} adsorbent particle in preparing cation exchange MMMs for lactoferrin (LF) recovery from whey. The static binding capacity of the cationic MMM was 384 mg LF g⁻¹membrane or 155 mg LF mL⁻¹ membrane, exceeding the capacity of several commercial adsorptive membranes. Adsorption of lysozyme onto the embedded ion exchange resin was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy. In LF isolation from whey, cross-flow operation was used to minimize membrane fouling and to enhance the protein binding capacity. LF recovery as high as of 91 % with a high purity (as judged by the presence of a single band in gel electrophoresis) was achieved from 150 mL feed whey. The MMM preparation concept was extended, for the first time, to produce a hydrophobic interaction membrane using crushed Phenyl Sepharose™ (GE Healthcare Technologies, Uppsala, Sweden) resin and tested for the feasibility in whey protein fractionation. Phenyl Sepharose MMM showed binding capacities of 20. 54 mg mL⁻¹ of β-Lac, 45. 58 mg mL⁻¹ of α-Lac, 38. 65 mg mL⁻¹ of BSA and 42. 05 mg mL⁻¹ of LF for a pure protein solution (binding capacity values given on a membrane volume basis). In flow through whey fractionation, the adsorption performance of the Phenyl Sepharose MMM was similar to the HiTrap™ Phenyl hydrophobic interaction chromatography column. However, in terms of processing speed and low pressure drop across the column, the benefits of using MMM over a packed bed column were clear. A novel mixed mode interaction membrane was synthesized in a single membrane by incorporating a certain ratio of SP Sepharose cation resin and Lewatit MP 500 anion resin into an EVAL base polymer solution. The mixed mode cation and anion membrane chromatography developed was able to bind basic and acidic proteins simultaneously from a solution. Furthermore, the ratio of the different types of adsorptive resin incorporated into the membrane matrix could be customised for protein recovery from a specific feedstream. The customized mixed mode MMM consisting of 42. 5 wt% of MP 500 anionic resin and 7. 5 wt% SP Sepharose cationic resin showed a binding capacity of 7. 16 mg α-Lac g⁻¹ membrane, 11. 40 mg LF g⁻¹ membrane, 59. 21 mg β-Lac g⁻¹ membrane and 6. 79 mg IgG g⁻¹ membrane from batch fractionation of 1 mL LF-spiked whey. A tangential flow process using this membrane was predicted to be able to produce 125 g <b>total</b> <b>whey</b> protein per L membrane per h...|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} {{incidence of}} allergies to cow’s milk proteins (CMP) in newborns enhanced {{the production of}} infant formula based on either soy proteins and/or hydrolysates of CMP. These formula, although having a good nutritional value, can {{be affected by the}} presence of peptides with a size stimulating the immunological response in predisposed subjects and/or an unpleasant taste for the infant consumers. Recent clinical studies indicated that patients with CMP allergy and also intolerant to these formula, showed a high tolerance towards the donkey milk, due to its greater quantitative similarities to human milk than cow’s milk. Specifically, although the mechanism of this tolerance has not yet been clarified, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the reduced allergenic properties of donkey milk can be related to structural differences of its protein components with respect to cow’s milk. At present, compared with cow’s milk, the characterization of donkey milk proteins (whey proteins and mainly caseins) is at a relatively early stage of progress, and only limited data are related to their heterogeneity. In this PhD thesis the complexity and specifically the qualitative and quantitative heterogeneity of donkey milk proteins of 77 animals reared in Italy was investigated using a proteomic approach. This analytical procedure for structural analysis of protein fractions is based on the combination of highly efficient separation techniques, such as one-dimensional electrophoretic techniques (PAGE pH 8. 6, UTLIEF, PAGE-SDS) or, more efficiently, the two dimensional (2 -DE) electrophoresis, coupled either to Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or immunospecific staining with polyclonal antibodies, to chromatography analysis (RP-HPLC), interfaced to structural Mass Spectrometry analysis (LC/ESI/MS, MALDI/TOF/MS, ESI q-TOF/MS). For donkey caseins, these combined methodologies allowed the contemporary identification of the four casein fractions (αs 1 -, αs 2 -, β- and κ-CN) in donkey milk together with their related heterogeneity due to post-translational phenomena such as the different phosphorylation degree of the caseins (αs 1 -, αs 2 -, β-CN) and the high glycosylation level of κ-CN, incorrect splicing of primary transcript in mRNA (non allelic deleted forms of αs 1 -, αs 2 -, β-CN) and genetic polymorphism of αs 1 - and β-CN (one or more variants in individual samples). At this regard, {{for the first time the}} primary structure of a new αs 1 -CN variant was determined, as well as and the amino acid sequences of three new genetic variants of β-CN (B, C, D) were characterized, using the known common αs 1 - and β-CN phenotype from donkey as reference, respectively. From a quantitative analysis, β-CN was always present in all analyzed donkey milk samples, as in human milk, representing the most abundant casein fraction followed by αs-CN complex. The αs 1 -CN showed an high variability in its expression level (0. 2 - 2 g/L), confirming a quantitative polymorphism at this locus as in goat milk. The minor expression of αs 1 -CN together with the absence of αs 2 -CN in some donkey milk samples, as in the human milk, confirms the compositional similarity of two milks and represent a scientific basis for donkey milk’s use in nutrition of infants with CMP allergy. The screening carried out on the individual whey protein samples by the proteomic approach revealed a monomorphism either for α-La (A) and for β-Lg I (B). β-Lg II was instead polymorphic, for the occurrence of four variants (A, B, C, D) already known in literature and for the identification of a new variant E. The primary structure of β-Lg II E was determined and differs from β-Lg II D for D Asp 2 /E Asn 2, D Arg 18 /E Lys 18, D Val 25 /E Ala 25 amino acid substitutions with a Mr 18256 Da. Moreover a quantitative polymorphism seemed to affect the donkey β-Lg II locus since different phenotypes, with a relative quantitative percentage respect to <b>total</b> <b>whey</b> protein ranging from 0 % to 3. 34 %, were detected by RP-HPLC. This quali-quantitative polymorphism at donkey β-Lg II locus seems to affect donkey milk composition and therefore, its allergenic properties. Moreover, the achieved results also highlighted that all examined samples have a high lysozyme content (2 g/L) which together with lactoferrin is important from an immunological point of view and for the shelf life of the milk. Finally, the donkey milk samples were shown to be poor in the total proteins (1. 48 %) as human milk, and specifically they were characterized by a lower casein content (35 - 40 %) with allergenic properties and a higher whey protein content (50 - 60 %) with biological activities, compared to bovine milk, with a CN/WP ratio < 1. However, in analyzed donkey milk samples, an individual variability either of each casein or whey protein amounts suggests further studies in this direction aimed at a selection of animals producing milk with a composition “qualitatively and quantitatively” more similar to human milk, and “functionalized” for infant feeding...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Fast {{proteolysis}} {{of cheese}} in ripening process {{may lead to}} the premature attack of casein, release of the majority of enzymes into the whey, and loss of cheese composition from curd to whey. In this study, the effect of liposomal Flavourzyme on proteolysis of Iranian white brined cheese, {{as well as on the}} yield and composition of whey and curd was investigated. Materials and Methods: Heating method (without using any toxic, volatile organic solvent or detergent) was used to nanoliposomal encapsulation of Flavourzyme. So, 0. 15 % and 0. 3 % (w/v) Flavourzyme-loaded liposome were incorporated to pasteurized cow milk. Iranian brined cheese was produced in triplicate using a complete randomized design. Then total solids were determined by drying them in an Infrared Oven. Water soluble nitrogen/total nitrogen and non-protein nitrogen/total nitrogen was determined by Kjeldahl method. Results: Encapsulation efficiency of liposomal Flavourzyme was 25 %. No significant differences between chemical components of cheese curd (total solid, protein, TCA-soluble nitrogen, water soluble nitrogen) and <b>whey</b> (<b>total</b> solid, protein) were observed between encapsulated cheese and the control. Cheese production yield in experimental cheese was not different from that in the control cheese (P> 0. 05).

The total number of 30 newborn Holstein calves of both sexes, weighting 35 ± 3 kg (mean±SD), were immediately after parturition separated from their dams and placed in individual pens. Calves were divided in two experimental groups, 15 calves each. All calves were bottle-fed twice/ day (1. 5 L/meal) during the first 48 hours after delivery, in 12 hour intervals, with their mother's first (during 24 hours postpartum) or second colostrum (at 24 - 48 hours postpartum), starting two hours after delivery. Zeolite suspension (20 mL, 25 % suspension in distilled water) was added to every meal for treated calves.

Changes {{were observed in}} total polyphenol intake, plasma oxidative status, plasma polyphenol content, metabolic status, milk polyphenol content, and total antioxidant capacity. The fresh forage diets (SUL and SULB) increased dry matter, total polyphenol, nontannic polyphenol and tannin intakes, and the milk total protein, casein, milk total polyphenols, and milk free polyphenols compared with the HB diet. The intake of condensed tannins was higher in the SUL than in the HB group, and an intermediate value was recorded for the SULB group. Plasma from the SUL- and SULBfed goats exhibited greater total antioxidant capacity and greater total polyphenol and free polyphenol levels compared with the plasma from the HB group. Positive correlations between plasma total antioxidant capacity and condensed tannins intake (r = 0. 43), plasma total polyphenol and total polyphenol intake (r = 0. 61), and plasma free polyphenol and milk total polyphenols (r = 0. 38) were observed.
