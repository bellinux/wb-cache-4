40|$|External {{post-tensioning}} {{can provide}} an effective structural reinforcement system {{for the design of}} new concrete structures and for the strengthening of existing structures. In most cases, the structural effectiveness of the external tendon is increased by using a deviated or harped tendon profile. Carbon-fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) reinforcement has emerged as an alternative to steel because it is non-corroding and fatigue resistant. However, its use in external post-tensioning has been limited {{due to a lack of}} knowledge regarding the tensile-flexural behaviour of the tendons under typical harped profiles. Limited test data has shown a reduction in the tendon capacity resulting from the combination of tensile and flexural stresses at the deviator locations. Existing models for predicting the capacity of a deviated tendon appear to be either unconservative or excessively conservative, limiting the application of CRFP tendons as external post-tensioning. This thesis describes an experimental research study of the tensile-flexural behaviour of post-tensioned CFRP tendons subjected to harped profiles. The program studied the effect of tendon size, deviator size and harping angle on the tendon behaviour. The tendons were loaded to failure in a specially designed <b>tension</b> <b>frame</b> that accommodated a range of harped configurations. Both the flexural and overall behaviour of the tendon were observed and recorded throughout the tests. The experimental data illustrates the effect of harping variables on the tendon response and capacity, and reveals the potential for different failure modes dependent on the combination of variables. A comparison of the test data with existing analytical and design equations shows poor correlation between the predicted and measured values. The research program clearly points out the inadequacies of the current analytical models and the need for an analytical model that more accurately predicts the tensile capacity of deviated CFRP tendons. A primary and an extended model were developed within the research program based on the material properties and geometry of the tendon and structural mechanics. The new models were found to perform very well and were used to develop design equations for the reduced tensile strength of harped CFRP tendons as well as failure mode control guidelines for the avoidance of undesirable failure modes...|$|E

This chapter begins from the perspective that a university {{can be regarded as}} a set of groupings with different, and sometimes competing, interests. For community engagement to become a serious institutional interest, engagement must offer something to each grouping within the university. This chapter explores the dynamics of these institutional dialogues as a means of understanding university–community engagement. Different groupings have different kinds of attachments to community engagement as a means of fulfilling their own interests. Where institutional narratives of community engagement can be found that encompass many different groupings’ attitudes, then community engagement can become important to the university. Otherwise, internal <b>tensions</b> <b>frame</b> community engagement as working against institutional interests, and hence reinforce its peripherality, contingency and optionality...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{it has been argued}} that the tension {{parameter}} driving the fluctuations of fluid membranes, differs from the imposed lateral stress, the 'frame tension'. In particular, stress-free membranes were predicted to have a residual fluctuation tension. In the present paper, this argument is reconsidered and shown to be inherently inconsistent [...] in the sense that a linearized theory, the Monge model, is used to predict a nonlinear effect. Furthermore, numerical simulations of one-dimensional stiff membranes are presented which clearly demonstrate, first, that the internal 'intrinsic' stress in membranes indeed differs from the <b>frame</b> <b>tension</b> as conjectured, but second, that the fluctuations are nevertheless driven by the <b>frame</b> <b>tension.</b> With this assumption, the predictions of the Monge model agree excellently with the simulation data for stiffness and tension values spanning several orders of magnitude...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} known for long that the {{fluctuation}} surface tension of membranes r, computed from the height fluctuation spectrum, is not equal to the bare surface tension σ introduced in the Helfrich theory. In this work we relate these two surface tensions both analytically and numerically and compare them to the Laplace tension γ, and the mechanical <b>frame</b> <b>tension</b> τ. Using one-loop renormalisation calculations, we obtain, in addition to the effective bending modulus κ_ eff, a new expression for the effective surface tension σ_ eff=σ - ϵ k_ BT/(2 a_p) where a_p the projected cut-off area, and ϵ= 3 or 1 according to the allowed configurations. Moreover we show that the crumpling transition for an infinite planar membrane occurs for σ_ eff= 0, and also that it coincides with vanishing Laplace and <b>frame</b> <b>tensions.</b> Using extensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, triangulated membranes of vesicles made of N= 100 - 2500 vertices are simulated. No local constraint is applied. It is shown that the numerical r is equal to σ_ eff both with radial MC moves (ϵ= 3) and with corrected MC moves locally normal to the fluctuating membrane (ϵ= 1). For finite vesicles of typical size R, two different regimes are defined: a tension regime for σ̂_ eff=σ_ effR^ 2 /κ_ eff> 0 and a bending one for - 1 <σ̂_ eff< 0. A shape transition from a quasi-spherical shape imposed by the large surface energy, to more deformed shapes only controlled by the bending energy, is observed numerically at σ̂_ eff≃ 0. We propose that the buckling transition, observed for planar supported membranes in the literature, occurs for σ̂_ eff≃- 1, the associated negative <b>frame</b> <b>tension</b> playing the role of a compressive force.

40|$|We review recent {{computer}} simulation studies of undulating lipid bilayers. Theoretical interpretations of such fluctuating membranes are most commonly based on generalized Helfrich-type elastic models, with additional contributions of local "protrusions" and/or density fluctuations. Such models provide an excellent basis for describing the fluctuations of tensionless bilayers in the fluid phase at a quantitative level. However, this description {{is found to}} fail for membranes in the gel phase and for membranes subject to high tensions. The fluctuations of tilted gel membranes show a signature of the modulated ripple structure, which is a nearby phase observed in the pretransition regime between the fluid and tilted gel state. This complicates a quantitative analysis on mesoscopic length scales. In the case of fluid membranes under tension, the large-wavelength fluctuation modes {{are found to be}} significantly softer than predicted by theory. In the latter context, we also address the general problem of the relation between <b>frame</b> <b>tension</b> and the fluctuation tension, which has been discussed somewhat controversially in recent years. Simulations of very simple model membranes with fixed area show that the fluctuations should be controlled by the <b>frame</b> <b>tension,</b> and not by the internal tension.

This practical submission is a site-specific installation that engages in a reciprocal dialogue with its environment. The individual sculptural works which demarcate {{the parameters of the}} installation are hybrids of domestic architectural forms, (namely the wall, the window and the door) and internal furnishings such as the curtain and the bed. These hybridised metal and resin constructions frame the interior of a site, a tennis court located within my immediate Grahamstown environment. The placement of familiar objects generally associated with the home and notions of security and privacy, within the open, exposed and permeable enclosure of the tennis court evoke a sense of displacement within the viewer. This supporting document, The Eyes of the Wall: Space, Narrative and Perspective, considers the key conceptual concerns informing my installation. In this mini-thesis I address the relationship between domestic architecture and the body, examining the notion of framing as fundamental to the individual comprehension of space. I position my work in relation to that of Mona Hatoum drawing on the similarities that exist between her practice and my own. In the first chapter of this paper: My House/Your House: Walls, Windows, Doors and Skins I address the relationship between domestic architecture, framing and the body, and ‘contamination’.
