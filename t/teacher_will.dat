5|$|Glee is an American musical comedy-drama {{television}} series that aired on the Fox {{network in the}} United States from May 19, 2009, to March 20, 2015. It focuses on the fictitious William McKinley High School glee club, New Directions, which competes on the show choir competition circuit while its disparate members deal with social issues, especially regarding sexuality and race, relationships, and learning to become an effective team. The initial twelve-member cast included club director and Spanish <b>teacher</b> <b>Will</b> Schuester (Matthew Morrison), cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), Will's wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), and eight club members played by Dianna Agron, Chris Colfer, Kevin McHale, Lea Michele, Cory Monteith, Amber Riley, Mark Salling, and Jenna Ushkowitz. In subsequent seasons, the main cast has expanded to fifteen members.|$|E
5|$|Spanish <b>teacher</b> <b>Will</b> Schuester (Matthew Morrison) {{learns that}} Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky), {{the head of}} William McKinley High School's glee club has been fired for {{inappropriate}} sexual behavior toward student Hank Saunders (Ben Bledsoe). The school principal, Figgins (Iqbal Theba), gives Will permission {{to take over the}} club, and he plans to revitalize it, naming the group New Directions. The club consists of fame-hungry Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), diva Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), flamboyant countertenor Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), paraplegic electric guitar player Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) and stuttering goth Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz). Will's efforts are derided by Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), head of the school's successful cheerleading team, the Cheerios, who soon plans to abolish the Glee club to restore her money funded towards the spoiled Cheerios. His wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) is also unsupportive, suggesting that Will become an accountant to increase their income and give up teaching. Rachel threatens to leave the club if Will cannot find a male vocalist with talent comparable to hers. When the school's football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) allows Will to try to recruit football team members, in return that he put a good word for Emma for him (because Ken likes her), he discovers that quarterback Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) is secretly a talented singer. He plants marijuana in Finn's locker, and blackmails him into joining New Directions. Finn, determined not to disappoint his widowed mother, complies.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, Dover Area School District {{agreed to}} {{participate}} in a pilot program to develop a new way to evaluate teachers that, in part, takes into account student achievement. Several other York County school districts also participated. The pilot program had 104 K-12 entities, including: nine career and technical centers, nine charter schools and nine intermediate units. Beginning in January 2012, York County some schools will use the new evaluation method and provide feedback to the Department of Education. This new evaluation will not be used to determine an educator’s official 2011-12 assessment. Under the new evaluation system, 50% of the evaluation of a <b>teacher</b> <b>will</b> be based on an observation divided into four categories: planning and preparation, classroom environment, instruction, and professional responsibilities. The other half will be based on student achievement (15 percent will be building-level data, 15 percent will be teacher-specific data, and 20 percent will be elective). The new evaluation system has both announced and unannounced observations. The system includes meetings between the teacher and evaluator before and after the direct observation of a lesson.|$|E
500|$|The {{retirement}} {{of a history}} teacher opens a tenured position at McKinley High. Spanish <b>teacher</b> <b>Will</b> Schuester (Matthew Morrison) and cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) both want the promotion, but anonymous students have registered complaints about the pair. Determined to polish up his language skills, Will goes to night school for a refresher course and meets instructor David Martinez (Ricky Martin), who points out that kids learn better through music. Will assigns a Spanish-themed week to New Directions and David helps by singing [...] "Sexy and I Know It" [...] partially in Spanish. Santana (Naya Rivera) suggests that Will now has a rival and needs to defend his honor.|$|E
500|$|Emma is {{introduced}} as the guidance counselor at William McKinley High School. She has romantic feelings for Spanish and glee <b>teacher</b> <b>Will</b> Schuester (Matthew Morrison), and encourages {{him in his}} attempt to revitalise the school glee club. She is dismayed to learn that Will's wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) is pregnant and that he is considering leaving the teaching profession to become an accountant, but is able to convince him to reconsider by showing him a video of him singing. In an attempt to get over Will, Emma begins dating football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher), and becomes engaged to him in the episode [...] "Vitamin D". However, when Will is unable to attend a competition with the glee club, Emma volunteers to take them in his place, and postpones her own wedding by several hours. Acknowledging her continuing feelings for Will, Ken breaks up with her on their wedding day. Emma tells Will that she has resigned from the school, as she is ashamed of her behavior with Ken, and is heartbroken that she cannot be with Will. Will tells her that he has left Terri, but Emma feels it is too soon for him to move on. Regardless, as she later prepares to leave the school, Will finds her and stops her with a kiss.|$|E

500|$|Several critics {{wrote that}} [...] Portal 2 excels in {{teaching}} the player to solve puzzles; {{in a review}} for the New York Times, Seth Schiesel wrote, [...] "Somewhere out there an innovative, dynamic high school physics <b>teacher</b> <b>will</b> use Portal 2 as the linchpin of an entire series of lessons and will immediately {{become the most important}} science teacher those lucky students have ever had." [...] Mathematics and science teachers wrote e-mails to Valve to tell them how they had included Portal in their classroom lessons as part of a project to promote the [...] "gamification of learning". Portal developers Joshua Weier and Yasser Malaika led a team within Valve to explore ways of using Portal 2 for education. This {{led to the development of}} Puzzle Maker, a level editor for Portal 2 players, built from the professional tools used to develop the game. Weier and Malaika did not want to design curricula themselves, but wanted to provide educators with tools for creating lesson plans. Hammer, the only tool freely available before the release of the built-in level editor in 2012, was difficult for educators to learn and understand. Valve gave Puzzle Maker an easy-to-learn interface and the ability to share puzzles and lesson plans. The tools were developed with a mathematics teacher and her students. This formed the basis of a new [...] "Steam for Schools" [...] initiative launched in June 2012, under which educators could acquire Portal 2 and the Puzzle Maker software free of charge for classroom use through its [...] "Teach with Portals" [...] program. , Valve estimates that over 2,500 educators are using the [...] "Teach with Portals" [...] software within their lesson plans.|$|E
500|$|Holly is a {{substitute}} teacher who makes her first appearance on Glee {{in the second}} season's seventh episode, [...] "The Substitute". She is filling in at McKinley High School for the ailing Spanish <b>teacher</b> <b>Will</b> (Matthew Morrison), who is also director of the glee club, New Directions. Club member Kurt (Chris Colfer), who had seen her perform [...] "Conjunction Junction" [...] when she subbed for his English class, asks her to also take over Will's glee club rehearsals. Instead of assigning songs, Holly asks the club members {{what kind of music}} they would like to perform, and when Puck (Mark Salling) suggests [...] "Forget You", she sings the song and they all join in, except for Rachel (Lea Michele). Holly later wins her over by asking Rachel what she would like to sing that she hasn't been able to, and they perform a number from Chicago together. Holly bonds with Sue (Jane Lynch), who is the acting principal with Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) also out sick, and Sue fires the still-ailing Will, making Holly the full-time director of the glee club. When he recovers, Will confronts Holly at school, but she is unwilling to give up her new position. She later discovers she is in over her head when Mercedes (Amber Riley) gets in trouble, and Holly turns to Will for help. She reveals that she was once a more serious teacher like Will until a student punched her in the face, at which point she became far more free spirited. Holly ultimately returns to substitute teaching and Will is reinstated. He assigns the glee club to perform [...] "Singin' in the Rain" [...] on his return, but faced with their dismay at being given another old song, he asks for Holly's help to modernize it, and they all perform a mash-up of it with Rihanna's [...] "Umbrella".|$|E

50|$|Formative {{evaluation}} typically {{occurs when}} changes {{can take place}} during the current semester, although many institutions consider written comments {{on how to improve}} formative as well. Typically this form of evaluation is performed by peer consultation. Other experienced <b>teachers</b> <b>will</b> review one of their peer’s instructions. The purpose of this evaluation is for the teacher to receive constructive criticism on teaching. Generally, peer <b>teachers</b> <b>will</b> sit in on a few lessons given by the teacher and take notes on their methods. Later on the team of peer <b>teachers</b> <b>will</b> meet with the said teacher and provide useful, non-threatening feedback on their lessons. The peer team will offer suggestions on improvement, which the said teacher can choose to implement.|$|R

2500|$|Merriam School. Named for Florence A. Merriam {{who taught}} for 35 years in Acton. Merriam offers a {{project-based}} curriculum. At Merriam, teachers teach {{the same group}} of students for two years (i.e., a <b>teacher</b> <b>will</b> teach first grade one year, second grade the next and then wrap back to first). This practice is called [...] "looping". Merriam School is housed in the Parker Damon Building which it shares with the McCarthy-Towne school.

[...] The bottom section {{consists}} of horizontal wavy lines, suggesting a flowing river, while the right section depicts {{a group of three}} trees which represents a park or forest (thus incorporating the town names [...] "oak park and river forest"). [...] The top left section is separated from the other two sections by a wide divider inscribed with the school's motto ΤΑ Γ'ΑΡΙΣΤΑ (Those things that are best), which conveys the hope that each student and <b>teacher</b> <b>will</b> strive for strong character and the best of their abilities.
