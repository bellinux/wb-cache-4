5|$|Group Captain James Stagg of the Royal Air Force (RAF) met Eisenhower on {{the evening}} of 4 June.

The next available dates with the required tidal conditions (but without the desirable full moon) would be two weeks later, from 18 to 20 June. Postponement of <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> would have required recalling men and ships already in position to cross the Channel, and would have increased the chance that <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> plans would be detected. After much discussion with the other senior commanders, Eisenhower decided that <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> should go ahead on the 6th. A major storm battered the Normandy coast from 19 to 22 June, which would have made the beach landings impossible.|$|E
