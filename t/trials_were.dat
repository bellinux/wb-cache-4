5|$|In late 1829, with {{construction}} of the railway almost complete, the Rainhill <b>Trials</b> <b>were</b> held on a short level stretch of the completed line near Rainhill, to test how the track withstood locomotives running over it and to determine which type of locomotive would be used, with a £500 prize at stake. The <b>Trials</b> <b>were</b> widely publicised, and 10,000–15,000 people attended the first day on 6October 1829. Of the five entrants Rocket, built by George Stephenson and his son Robert, was the only entrant to complete the trial without suffering a serious failure, and was duly selected as the design to be used. (Although often described as a race, and shown as such in illustrations, the Rainhill <b>Trials</b> <b>were</b> a series of independent trials. Each engine ran on a different day.) At {{around the time of}} the Rainhill Trials the tunnel to the forthcoming Liverpool terminus—the first tunnel ever dug under a major built-up area—was completed. To win over sceptical locals it was whitewashed, fitted with lighting and a band, and the public charged a shilling apiece to walk through it.|$|E

5|$|Nanda and Hiranandani {{proved to}} be {{instrumental}} in taking Vikrant to war. There were objections that the ship might have severe operational difficulties that would expose the carrier to increased danger on operations. In addition, the three s acquired by the Pakistan Navy posed a significant risk to the carrier. In June, extensive deep sea <b>trials</b> <b>were</b> carried out, with steel safety harnesses around the three boilers still operational. Observation windows were fitted as a precautionary measure, to detect any steam leaks.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Gaols Committee's inquiries, several key figures within the jails were tried for murder in August 1729, {{including}} Thomas Bambridge of the Fleet and William Acton of the Marshalsea.

5|$|Between 1950 and 1952, <b>trials</b> <b>were</b> {{conducted}} in Tanganyika, at Kikore and Stunyansa, to test arboricides and defoliants under tropical conditions. The chemicals involved were 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, and endothall (3,6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid). During 1952–53, the unit supervised the aerial spraying of 2,4,5-T over the Waturi peninsula in Kenya {{to assess the}} value of defoliants in the eradication of tsetse fly.|$|E

5|$|In 1834, in British Guiana, a German physician, Carl Warburg, invented an {{antipyretic}} medicine: 'Warburg's Tincture'. This secret, proprietary remedy contained quinine {{and other}} herbs. <b>Trials</b> <b>were</b> made in Europe in the 1840s and 1850s. It was officially {{adopted by the}} Austrian Empire in 1847. It was considered by many eminent medical professionals {{to be a more}} efficacious antimalarial than quinine. It was also more economical. The British Government supplied Warburg's Tincture to troops in India and other colonies.|$|E

5|$|It may be {{possible}} to exploit RNA interference in therapy. Although it is difficult to introduce long dsRNA strands into mammalian cells due to the interferon response, the use of short interfering RNA has been more successful.

RNAi has also been shown to be effective in reversing induced liver failure in mouse models.|$|E
5|$|Latouche-Tréville, {{named in}} honor of Vice Admiral comte de Latouche-Tréville, was laid down on 26 April 1890 at the Granville {{shipyard}} of Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée. She was launched on 5 November 1893 and commissioned for sea trials on 16 October. While initial <b>trials</b> <b>were</b> successful, further testing revealed multiple problems that required over {{a year and a half}} of work before she was commissioned for service on 6 May 1895.|$|E

As with her sister , construction proceeded under absolute secrecy; detachments of soldiers guarded the shipyard and also guarded contractors that supplied building materials, such as Krupp. The ship was launched {{a year and a half}} later, on 12 December 1908. Wilhelm August Hans von Waldow-Reitzenstein gave a speech at her launching, and Posen was christened by Johanna von Radolin, the wife of Hugo Fürst von Radolin, a German diplomat who hailed from the ship's namesake province. Initial <b>trials</b> <b>were</b> conducted through April 1910, followed by final fitting-out in May. The ship was commissioned into the fleet on 31 May. Sea <b>trials</b> <b>were</b> conducted afterward and completed by 27 August. In total, her construction cost the German government 36,920,000marks.|$|E

5|$|The LaRouche {{criminal}} {{trials in}} the mid-1980s stemmed from federal and state investigations into the activities of American political activist Lyndon LaRouche and members of his movement.
