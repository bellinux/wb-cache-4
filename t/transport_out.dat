In March 1996, Store Norske, Kings Bay and Lufttransport sign an {{agreement}} concerning intra-island <b>transport</b> <b>out</b> of Longyearbyen. This involves the introduction of Dornier Do 228 aircraft, which will operate for Store Norske to Svea and for Kings Bay to Ny-Ålesund Airport, Hamnerabben. Store Norske commences construction of the new town and mine, and mining operations start in January 1997.|$|E
25|$|Imperial Eagle, {{originally}} named Loudoun (also spelled Louden, Loudin, and Lowden), was a 400-ton burthen (bm) British merchant ship, {{launched in}} 1774 at Liverpool. By 1780 her master was S. Rains, her owner Robertson, and her trade a <b>transport</b> <b>out</b> of London. In 1786 she underwent refitting at Shadwell Dock, Thames, London.

25|$|Atmospheric forcings {{also have}} a strong impact on Arctic Sea Ice export through the EGC. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)/Arctic Oscillation (AO) has a {{profound}} impact on the wind field over the Arctic. During high NAO/AO indexes the cyclonic wind field over the Arctic becomes very strong, this transports more ice out through Fram Strait and into the EGC. During low NAO/AO indexes the cyclonic wind field is quite small and thus the <b>transport</b> <b>out</b> of the Fram Strait diminishes greatly.|$|E

500|$|In January 1998, No.84 Wing was reorganised as {{a special}} {{transport}} wing under ALG, [...] "special transport" [...] meaning activities {{not directly related to}} army support, such as carrying VIPs. Its headquarters was relocated to Richmond. In addition to No.32 Squadron, its complement included No.33 Squadron, operating Boeing 707s for air-to-air refuelling and VIP <b>transport</b> <b>out</b> of Richmond, and No.34 Squadron, operating Falcon 900s for VIP <b>transport</b> <b>out</b> of RAAF Base Fairbairn in Canberra. Nos.35 and 38 Squadrons meanwhile transferred to No.86 Wing, also headquartered at Richmond. Two of No.33 Squadron's five 707s were soon employed to form No.84 Wing DetachmentA in Kuwait, as part of Operation Southern Watch. On 5March, one of the 707s undertook the first operational aerial tanker mission since the squadron's re-formation in 1983, when it refuelled six Panavia Tornados of the Royal Air Force (RAF) over Saudi Arabia. The detachment subsequently refuelled US EA-6 Prowlers, F/A-18 Hornets, and AV-8 Harriers, as well as RAF Harriers, in addition to the Tornados. From March to September 2002, two 707s formed No.84 Wing Detachment as part of Australia's contribution to the war in Afghanistan. [...] Located at Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan, the 707s provided aerial refuelling to coalition aircraft operating in the theatre, their efforts earning No.84 Wing a Meritorious Unit Citation.|$|E
500|$|As one of {{the largest}} {{structures}} in the city, evacuees were brought to the Superdome to wait out the storm or to await further evacuation. Many others {{made their way to the}} Superdome on their own, hoping to find food, water, shelter, or <b>transport</b> <b>out</b> of town. On August 29, Katrina passed over New Orleans with such force that it ripped two holes in the Superdome roof. On the evening of August 30, Maj. Gen. Bennett C. Landreneau, of the Louisiana National Guard, said that the number of people taking shelter in the Superdome had risen to around 15,000 to 20,000 as search and rescue teams brought more people to the Superdome from areas hard-hit by the flooding. As conditions worsened and flood waters continued to rise, on August 31, Governor Blanco ordered that all of New Orleans, including the Superdome, be evacuated. The area outside the Superdome was flooded to a depth of , with a possibility of [...] if the area equalized with Lake Pontchartrain.

500|$|She finds Hugh {{to be not}} a mindless drone but a {{confused}} young man, and she agrees Hugh {{is no longer a}} Borg. Guinan convinces Picard to meet with Hugh, as well, and Picard comes to the same conclusion, in part because Hugh refers to himself as [...] "I" [...] instead of the Borg's collective [...] "we" [...] during their discussion. Picard abandons the proposed plan and instead offers Hugh asylum within the Federation. Hugh expresses enthusiasm at the prospect of remaining with La Forge but ultimately refuses, recognizing that the Borg will still come looking for him. He offers to be returned to the crash site, where he will be found and re-assimilated by the Borg. Picard hopes that, once Hugh is reconnected, the sense of individualism Hugh has learned will spread throughout the Collective. La Forge accompanies Hugh to the crash site and, from a safe distance, watches the Borg recover him. Just as the Borg <b>transport</b> <b>out,</b> Hugh turns to give La Forge a parting glance.|$|E

2500|$|By 1882, eleven Tennessee marble {{quarries}} were {{in operation}} in Knox County alone. [...] This number had doubled within a decade, as the rising popularity of Neoclassical architecture {{brought about a}} rapid increase in demand for marble. Knoxville, the industry's chief financial and production center, became known as [...] "The Marble City" [...] during this period and even included a marble mining derrick on the Knoxville flag. The community of Concord, located west of Knoxville, became a key marble transloading center, where blocks were transferred from boats to rail cars for <b>transport</b> <b>out</b> of the region. [...] By 1885, Concord was home to ten marble-related companies.|$|E

2500|$|The kidneys excrete {{a variety}} of waste {{products}} produced by metabolism into the urine. These include the nitrogenous wastes urea, from protein catabolism, and uric acid, from nucleic acid metabolism. [...] The ability of mammals and some birds to concentrate wastes into a volume of urine {{much smaller than the}} volume of blood from which the wastes were extracted is dependent on an elaborate countercurrent multiplication mechanism. This requires several independent nephron characteristics to operate: a tight hairpin configuration of the tubules, water and ion permeability in the descending limb of the loop, water impermeability in the ascending loop, and active ion <b>transport</b> <b>out</b> of most of the ascending limb. In addition, passive countercurrent exchange by the vessels carrying the blood supply to the nephron is essential for enabling this function.|$|E
2500|$|The {{membrane}} of {{the rough}} endoplasmic reticulum forms large double membrane sheets that are located near, and continuous with, the outer layer of the nuclear envelope. The double membrane sheets are stacked and connected through several right or left-handed helical ramps, the so-called Terasaki ramps, giving rise to a structure resembling [...] a parking garage. Although there is no continuous membrane between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, membrane-bound vesicles shuttle proteins between these two compartments. Vesicles are surrounded by coating proteins called COPI and COPII. COPII targets vesicles to the Golgi apparatus and COPI marks them to be {{brought back to the}} rough endoplasmic reticulum. The rough endoplasmic reticulum works in concert with the Golgi complex to target new proteins to their proper destinations. A second method of <b>transport</b> <b>out</b> of the endoplasmic reticulum involves areas called membrane contact sites, where the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles are held closely together, allowing the transfer of lipids and other small molecules.|$|E

2500|$|... miRNA biogenesis {{in plants}} differs from animal biogenesis {{mainly in the}} steps of nuclear {{processing}} and export. Instead of being cleaved by two different enzymes, once inside and once outside the nucleus, both cleavages of the plant miRNA are performed by a Dicer homolog, called Dicer-like1 (DL1). DL1 is expressed only in the nucleus of plant cells, which indicates that both reactions take place inside the nucleus. Before plant miRNA:miRNA* duplexes are <b>transported</b> <b>out</b> of the nucleus, its 3' overhangs are methylated by a RNA methyltransferaseprotein called Hua-Enhancer1 (HEN1). The duplex is then <b>transported</b> <b>out</b> of the nucleus to the cytoplasm by a protein called Hasty (HST), an Exportin 5 homolog, where they disassemble and the mature miRNA is incorporated into the RISC.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of fructose absorption {{in the small}} intestine is not completely understood. Some evidence suggests active transport, because fructose uptake {{has been shown to}} occur against a concentration gradient. However, the majority of research supports the claim that fructose absorption occurs on the mucosal membrane via facilitated transport involving GLUT5 transport proteins. Since the concentration of fructose is higher in the lumen, fructose is able to flow down a concentration gradient into the enterocytes, assisted by transport proteins. Fructose may be <b>transported</b> <b>out</b> of the enterocyte across the basolateral membrane by either GLUT2 or GLUT5, although the GLUT2 transporter has a greater capacity for transporting fructose, and, therefore, the majority of fructose is <b>transported</b> <b>out</b> of the enterocyte through GLUT2.|$|R
