5|$|David Bunnell joined MITS as a <b>technical</b> <b>writer</b> in the {{calculator}} heyday. In April 1975 {{he created}} a newsletter so the MITS staff could easily communicate with the customers. The newsletter, Computer Notes, was available to customers and other interested readers. It was a large format newsletter; 11.25 by 15.5inches (286 by 394mm), and each issue had 8 to 24 pages. In January 1977, it switched to a smaller magazine format and the last issue was produced in January 1978. Bunnell started Personal Computer magazine in October 1976 {{and went on to}} a successful career as a magazine publisher.|$|E
25|$|Cornwell {{began work}} on her first novel in 1984, about a male detective named Joe Constable and met Dr. Marcella Farinelli Fierro, a medical {{examiner}} in Richmond, and subsequent inspiration for the character of Dr. Kay Scarpetta. In 1985, she {{took a job at}} the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia. She worked there for six years, first as a <b>technical</b> <b>writer</b> and then as a computer analyst. She also volunteered to work with the Richmond Police Department. Cornwell wrote three novels that she says were rejected before the publication, in 1990, of the first installment of her Scarpetta series, Postmortem, based on real-life stranglings in Richmond in the summer of 1987. The novel won her various awards including the British John Creasey Award, the French Prix du Roman d'Adventure and the American Edgar Award.|$|E
25|$|An {{early and}} {{influential}} {{book about the}} subject of a moon-landing conspiracy, We Never Went to the Moon: America's Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle, was self-published in 1976 by Bill Kaysing. Despite having no knowledge of rockets or technical writing, Kaysing, a former US Navy officer with a Bachelor of Arts in English, was hired as a senior <b>technical</b> <b>writer</b> in 1956 by Rocketdyne, the company that built the F-1 engines used on the Saturn V rocket. He served as head of the technical publications unit at the company's Propulsion Field Laboratory until 1963. Kaysing's book made many allegations, and effectively began discussion of the Moon landings being faked. The book claims that the chance of a successful manned landing on the Moon was calculated to be 0.0017%, and that despite close monitoring by the USSR, {{it would have been easier}} for NASA to fake the Moon landings than to really go there.|$|E
50|$|The {{organization}} traces {{its roots}} to the Society of <b>Technical</b> <b>Writers</b> (STW) in Boston and the Association of <b>Technical</b> <b>Writers</b> and Editors (ATWE) in New York. Both were {{founded in the}} United States in 1953. These organizations merged in 1957 to form the Society of <b>Technical</b> <b>Writers</b> and Editors (STWE). In 1960, this group merged with the Technical Publishing Society (TPS), based in Los Angeles, to become the Society of <b>Technical</b> <b>Writers</b> and Publishers. In 1971, the organization's name was changed to the Society for Technical Communication.|$|R
40|$|Subject matter experts, {{under the}} {{influence}} of modernist notions of authorship, often view <b>technical</b> <b>writers</b> as mere grammar and punctuation specialists and marginalize them as their ignorant “other. ” <b>Technical</b> <b>writers,</b> on the other hand, as rhetoricians occupying a liminal space between different disciplines, can understand different disciplinary rhetorics. If subject matter experts, instead of marginalizing <b>technical</b> <b>writers,</b> would view them as liminal subjects who are knowledgeable in different disciplinary rhetorics, then <b>technical</b> <b>writers,</b> through liminal practice, may be able to use their knowledge of audience and rhetoric {{to improve the quality of}} documentation. Keywords: liminality; othering; rhetoric; technical communication; postcolonial theory Technical writing includes a variety of tasks, ranging from conducting and reporting research for corporate management to composing online documentation. Technical writing may also include the writing of subject matter experts, such as engineers, who “write reports, proposals, and correspondence” (Selzer, 1983, p. 179), or others who, as Winsor (1994 b) explained, produce representations and inscriptions in the form of “presentations” or “symbols other than words ” (p. 344). In many technical writing situations, subject matter experts and <b>technical</b> <b>writers</b> collaborate to author documents. As Emerson (1987) described it, “In practice many technical documents are written by a group of people rather than by an individual. Each person working on the project must understand and carry out his or her role in the production of the final document” (p. 29). However, this article explores only those relationships involving subject matter experts and <b>technical</b> <b>writers.</b> In these relationships between subject matter experts and <b>technical</b> <b>writers,</b> a power differential sometimes exists that affects the technical writing situation.

50|$|<b>Technical</b> <b>writers</b> and {{corporate}} communicators are professionals whose field and work is documentation. Ideally, <b>technical</b> <b>writers</b> have {{a background in}} both the subject matter and also in writing and managing content (information architecture). <b>Technical</b> <b>writers</b> more commonly collaborate with subject matter experts (SMEs), such as engineers, technical experts, medical professionals, or other types of clients to define and then create content (documentation) that meets the user's needs. Corporate communications includes other types of written documentation that is required for most companies.|$|R

[...] Miller's final judgment is to call it [...] "a passable effort" [...] and to compare unfavourably to the arcade version. Edward J.

2500|$|Building 20 was {{the home}} of [...] the Tech Model Railroad Club, where many aspects of what later became the hacker culture developed. [...] Around 1973, the MIT Electronic Research Society (MITERS) was founded there, as an early student-run hackerspace. [...] Building 20 also housed {{one of the first}} {{anechoic}} chambers, where research was performed by acoustics pioneer Leo Beranek. [...] Professor Amar Bose did his early research on loudspeakers here, eventually leading to the founding of Bose Corporation. Prolific analog circuit designer and <b>technical</b> <b>writer</b> Jim Williams had an electronics lab here for a decade, before moving on to National Semiconductor and then Linear Technology.

2500|$|Farmer had {{his first}} {{literary}} success when his novella The Lovers was published by Samuel Mines in Startling Stories, August 1952. It features a sexual relationship between a human and an extraterrestrial and he won the next Hugo Award as [...] "most promising new writer" [...] (his first of three Hugos). Thus encouraged, he quit his job to become a full-time writer, entered a publisher's contest, and promptly won the $4,000 first prize for a novel, Owe for the Flesh, that contained the germ of his later Riverworld series. But the book was not published and Farmer {{did not get the}} money. Literary success did not translate into financial security so he left Peoria in 1956 to launch a career as a <b>technical</b> <b>writer.</b> He spent the next 14 years working in that capacity for various defense contractors, from Syracuse, New York to Los Angeles, while writing science fiction in his spare time.|$|E
