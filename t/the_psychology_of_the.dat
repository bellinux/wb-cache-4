5|$|Stratton {{articulated}} his {{own beliefs}} about religion as well. He did not {{subscribe to the}} view religious feeling was primarily a social need, believing {{it to be a}} need for seeing a cause and logic to the world along with a harmony to things. A believer in dualism, he held the theory of a separate biological psyche and something beyond it. To him the most important aspects of the psyche lay beyond objective science, at least in his time. He sought to explore those boundaries where the methods of science had to stop and declare what was beyond as unknown, limited by the tools of the times. In <b>The</b> <b>Psychology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Religious Life he laid out his definition of religion as an appreciative feeling toward an unseen entity marked the best or the greatest.|$|E

25|$|Apart from {{a passing}} mention by another (minor) author, the Annales by the Roman {{historian}} Tacitus (written ca. 98 AD) {{is the sole}} surviving ancient source on the Tacfarinas War. Tacitus gives a relatively detailed account, but its exclusivity {{makes it difficult to}} assess its accuracy and the war's significance. Tacitus was fascinated by <b>the</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emperor Tiberius, whom he regarded as the quintessential flawed tyrant, and the way that the long-drawn out insurgency in Africa with its many crises exposed his weaknesses. For example, the emperor's explosion of fury when he received envoys from Tacfarinas demanding concessions in return for peace. This was not only due to Tiberius' exasperation with the insurgency. Adding insult to injury, Tacfarinas was apparently a commoner by birth, an affront to the status-conscious Romans. To Tiberius, a scion of the illustrious Claudii patrician clan and ruler of a vast empire, it seemed intolerable that such a person should be seeking to deal with him on an equal basis, like a foreign king. Tacitus relates with relish Tiberius' feelings of personal humiliation.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic Church {{lost all}} its lands and {{buildings}} during the French Revolution, {{and these were}} sold off or came {{under the control of}} local governments. The more radical elements of the Revolution tried to suppress the church, but Napoleon came to a compromise with the pope in the Concordat of 1801 that restored much of its status. The bishop still ruled his diocese (which was aligned with the new department boundaries), but could only communicate with the pope through the government in Paris. Bishops, priests, nuns and other religious people were paid salaries by the state. All the old religious rites and ceremonies were retained, and the government maintained the religious buildings. The Church was allowed to operate its own seminaries and to some extent local schools as well, although this became a central political issue into the 20th century. Bishops were much less powerful than before, and had no political voice. However, the Catholic Church reinvented itself and put a new emphasis on personal religiosity that gave it a hold on <b>the</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> faithful.|$|E
25|$|One {{theory to}} explain the {{evolution}} of traits like a peacock's tail is 'runaway selection'. This requires two traits—a trait that exists, like the bright tail, and a prexisting bias in the female to select for that trait. Females prefer the more elaborate tails, and thus those males are able to mate successfully. Exploiting <b>the</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> female, a positive feedback loop is enacted and the tail becomes bigger and brighter. Eventually, the evolution will level off because the survival costs to the male do not allow for the trait to be elaborated any further. Two theories exist to explain runaway selection. The first is the good genes hypothesis. This theory states that an elaborate display is an honest signal of fitness and truly is a better mate. The second is the handicap hypothesis. This explains that the peacock's tail is a handicap, requiring energy to keep and makes it more visible to predators. Thus, the signal is costly to maintain, and remains an honest indicator of the signaler's condition. Another assumption is that the signal is more costly for low quality males to produce than for higher quality males to produce. This is simply because the higher quality males have more energy reserves available to allocate to costly signaling.|$|E

500|$|In , {{the authors}} utilize {{statements}} made by Homer in the episode to analyze the difference between heuristic and algorithmic decision-making. Homer explains to Lisa, [...] "Stupid risks are what make life worth living. Now your mother, she's the steady type and that's fine in small doses, but me, I'm a risk-taker. That's why I have so many adventures!" [...] The authors of <b>The</b> <b>Psychology</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Simpsons interpret this statement by Homer to mean that he [...] "relies on his past experiences of taking massive, death-defying risks and winding up okay to justify forging ahead in the most extreme circumstances".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} cited by Robert M. Arkin and Philip J.

Arkin and Mazzocco note an exchange between Edna Krabappel and Seymour Skinner, where Skinner exclaims to Krabappel: [...] "Oh come on Edna: We both know these kids have no future! [...] Prove me wrong, kids. Prove me wrong." [...] Arkin and Mazzocco note that this example {{is seen as an}} exception, writing: [...] "Generally, however, the Simpsons are right on target in their understanding of the importance of self-esteem and the dynamics involved in the interplay between the social world and positive self-regard." ...|$|E

500|$|In , {{the authors}} cite [...] "escaping from a cult commune in 'The Joy of Sect'" [...] as {{evidence}} of [...] "Aristotle's virtuous personality traits in Marge." [...] As the title suggests, the book [...] examines [...] "The Joy of Sect" [...] from a psychological point of view. It discusses the psychology of decision-making in the episode, noting, [...] "Homer is becoming a full-blown member of the Movementarians not by a rational choice,... but {{through the process of}} escalating behavioral commitments." [...] <b>The</b> <b>Psychology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Simpsons explains the key recruitment techniques used by the Movementarians, including the charismatic leader, established authority based on a religious entity or alien being (in this case [...] "Blisstonia"), and the method of taking away free choice through acceptance of the Leader's greatness. The book also analyzes the techniques used during the six-hour Movementarian recruitment film. In that scene, those who rise to leave are reminded that they are allowed to leave whenever they wish. They are, however, questioned in front of the group as to specifically why they wish to leave, and these individuals end up staying to finish watching the film. The book describes this technique as [...] "subtle pressure", in contrast to the [...] "razor wire, landmines, angry dogs, crocodiles and evil mystery bubble Marge confronts to escape, while being reminded again that she is certainly free to leave". <b>The</b> <b>Psychology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Simpsons writes that [...] "the Leader" [...] is seen as an authority figure, because [...] "he has knowledge or abilities that others do not, but want". Instead of traditional mathematics textbooks, the children on the compound learn from Arithmetic the Leader's Way and Science for Leader Lovers.|$|E
500|$|In their {{section on}} the episode in the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood comment: [...] "We love Homer sitting at home trying to {{remember}} to pick up Bart—he's watching a TV show about a baseball star called Bart, with pictures of Bart on all sides, and even Maggie seems to be calling her brother's name." [...] Writing in the compilation work <b>The</b> <b>Psychology</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Simpsons, Robert M. Arkin and Philip J. Mazzocco reference {{a scene from the}} episode where Homer [...] "argues with his own brain about a desired course of action" [...] to illustrate self-discrepancy theory, the idea that [...] "humans will {{go to great lengths to}} attain and preserve self-esteem".|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{received}} favorably in {{a publication of}} Southern Methodist University. In the introduction to an interview {{with one of the}} book's editors, the interviewer noted: [...] "Get past the goofy cover, with its illustration of Homer’s beer- and TV-saturated brain, and you find analysis aimed at both TV viewers and students of psychology." [...] The book also received positive mention in The Times, where Andrew Billen wrote: [...] "I can commend D'Oh!: <b>The</b> <b>Psychology</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Simpsons and Reading The Sopranos, since both shows are sturdy enough to support the intellectual studies." [...] An article at The Simpsons Archive also wrote positively of the work: [...] "The connection to the show and its events is solid and psychological points are illustrated using explanatory snippets from the Simpsons." ...|$|E
