5|$|In 1945, the Butoku Kai {{promoted}} Abbe to 7th dan in judo and 6th dan in kendo. Following {{the end of}} World War II, {{however, the}} Butoku Kai and Busen were both closed down. Abbe took up {{the position of a}} judo teacher for <b>the</b> <b>Kyoto</b> Prefectural Police Department. He became Chief Instructor of judo for <b>the</b> <b>Kyoto</b> police, and also taught at Doshisha University in that city. After the Abbes had a third daughter, Yayoi, Abbe resigned from <b>the</b> <b>Kyoto</b> police. During this period, he felt that judo in Japan was declining, and ended his association with the Kodokan in the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|The NZ ETS {{created a}} {{specific}} domestic emission unit {{for use in}} New Zealand, the New Zealand Unit (NZU).

5|$|As large {{consumers}} of fossil fuels, First World countries {{drew attention to}} environmental pollution. <b>The</b> <b>Kyoto</b> Protocol is a treaty {{that is based on}} the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was finalized in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio. It proposed to place the burden of protecting the climate on the United States and other First World countries. Countries that were considered to be developing, such as China and India, were not required to approve the treaty because they were more concerned that restricting emissions would further restrain their development.|$|E
5|$|In February 2007, the Liberal {{opposition}} {{brought forward}} a non-binding motion for Canada to renew {{its commitment to}} <b>the</b> <b>Kyoto</b> Protocol. All Conservative MPs who {{were present in the}} House, including Baird, voted against the motion, which passed {{with the support of the}} three opposition parties. The following month, opposition members on a special Commons committee used their majority to bring forward sweeping changes to the government's Clean Air Act. Among other things, the revised act called for participation in international carbon markets and the fulfillment of Kyoto targets.|$|E

Some museums, including the Museo Stibbert, and <b>the</b> <b>Kyoto</b> Costume Institute in Japan, present their metal bodices as fashionable late 16th-century garments. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London describes their iron corset (formerly owned by the painter Talbot Hughes) as dating from the 18th century and likely intended for orthopaedic purposes. Others, such as the iron corset in the Fashion Institute of Technology, are presented as fakes.|$|E
5|$|On 6 December 2007, the New Zealand Emission Unit Register (NZEUR) was established. The NZEUR has {{the role}} of issuing, holding, {{transferring}} and retiring emission units in terms of <b>the</b> <b>Kyoto</b> Protocol. The initial use of the NZEUR was to record Kyoto emission units allocated to firms enrolled in the Ministry for the Environment’s Projects to Reduce Emissions and Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements programmes, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry’s Permanent Forest Sink Initiative.|$|E

5|$|Switzerland {{has one of}} {{the best}} {{environmental}} records among nations in the developed world; {{it was one of the}} countries to sign <b>the</b> <b>Kyoto</b> Protocol in 1998 and ratified it in 2003. With Mexico and the Republic of Korea it forms the Environmental Integrity Group (EIG). The country is heavily active in recycling and anti-littering regulations and is one of the top recyclers in the world, with 66% to 96% of recyclable materials being recycled, depending on the area of the country. The 2014 Global Green Economy Index ranked Switzerland among the top 10 green economies in the world.|$|E
5|$|The NZ ETS {{contains}} special {{transitional provisions}} from 1 July 2010 (when fossil emissions enter the scheme) until 31 December 2012 (transition period).

Although transitional measures are legislated to end after 2012, the Government has suggested {{that they will be}} extended in the event that major trading partners such as the USA and Australia do not implement emissions trading schemes of their own before then.|$|E

5|$|The {{impacts of}} the various options were {{estimated}} as the differences between a carbon tax and a reference ‘business as usual’ scenario assuming New Zealand had not signed <b>the</b> <b>Kyoto</b> Protocol. The variables changed in the model runs were the NZ carbon price ($0, $10, $25 or $100), the world carbon price, the duration (short term to 2012, long term to 2025), the level of free allocation and whether the Government assumed all Kyoto liabilities. The results of each model run was reported as the percent difference from the 'no-Kyoto' ‘business as usual’ scenario in 2012 or 2025.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} scheme covered all six greenhouse gases specified in <b>the</b> <b>Kyoto</b> Protocol and {{was intended to}} progressively apply to all {{sectors of the economy}} including agriculture. 'Participants' (who would account for their emissions) were to be few, and high in the production chain of each sector.
