5|$|Francis, {{convinced}} that he would regain his freedom if he could obtain a personal audience with Charles, pressed d'Avalos and Lannoy, who had intended to transport the king to the Castel Nuovo in Naples, <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Spain instead. Concerned by Bourbon's scheming, they agreed and Francis arrived in Barcelona on 12 June.|$|E

5|$|Stafford blames Arab nationalists, most {{prominently}} Rashid Ali al-Gaylani and Bakr Sidqi. According to him, Iraqi Army officers despised the Assyrians, and Sidqi {{in particular was}} vocal of his hate for them.

5|$|An old blind woman, {{who came}} to listen and give the boy advice, told his father of Fauré's gift for music.

5|$|John {{initially}} attended local schools. When he was aged 10, {{his family}} scraped together the money <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Midland District Grammar School in Kingston. Macdonald's formal schooling ended at 15, a common school-leaving age {{at a time}} when only children from the most prosperous families were able to attend university. Nevertheless, Macdonald later regretted leaving school when he did, remarking to his secretary Joseph Pope that if he had attended university, he might have embarked on a literary career.|$|E

5|$|Ivan Bagramyan {{was born}} to Armenian parents {{in the village of}} Chardakhlu, near Yelizavetpol (modern Ganja, Azerbaijan), then a part of the Russian Empire. Chardakhlu was one of the largest Armenian {{settlements}} in the South Caucasus populated almost entirely by migrants from the village of Maghavuz in Nagorno Karabakh who continued keeping a connection with their ancestral land. Hamazasp Babadzhanian, a fellow Armenian who was to become the chief marshal of the Soviet Armor corps, was born in the same village. While Bagramyan's father, Khachatur, went to work all day at the railway station in Yelizavetpol, his mother, Mariam, stayed at home {{to take care of her}} seven children. Because his parents could not afford <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the local gymnasium, they decided to enroll him at a recently opened two-year school in Yelizavetpol.|$|E
5|$|Offensive {{additions}} included halfback Ara Parseghian {{and quarterback}} George Terlep, {{but the most}} significant signing {{of the year was}} Dub Jones. Brown got Jones – who had a long and successful career in Cleveland – in a trade with the Brooklyn Dodgers for the rights to draft Bob Chappuis. Author Andy Piasick describes this trade {{as one of the most}} astute in Browns history. The Browns also signed quarterback Y. A. Tittle from Louisiana State University, but were forced <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the Baltimore Colts as part of an effort to balance talent among the AAFC's teams during the league's third year of play.|$|E

They go to an {{apartment}} where they swim and eat food; Neto leaves the place when Lobo suggests that they reciprocate for the food by letting the men there caress them. Alone in downtown, Neto begs for money, and he is helped by a woman called Leninha. She takes him home {{to have lunch with}} some friends; after it, Neto and Leninha have sex. Later, at night, he is arrested for doing graffiti, and his parents pick him up at the police station. The following day, Neto is in his bedroom and his father finds a marijuana cigarette in his jacket. Neto's sister advises his parents <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> a mental institution.|$|E

5|$|In December 1415 Dauphin Louis died {{suddenly}} at age 18 of illness, leaving Isabeau's political status unclear. Her 17-year-old fourth-born son, John of Touraine, now the Dauphin, {{had been raised}} since childhood in the household of Duke William II of Bavaria in Hainaut. Married to Countess Jacqueline of Hainaut, Dauphin John was a Burgundian sympathizer. William of Bavaria refused <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Paris {{during a period of}} upheaval as Burgundians plundered the city and Parisians revolted against another wave of tax increases initiated by Count Bernard VII of Armagnac; in a period of lucidity, Charles had raised the Count to be the Constable of France. Isabeau attempted to intervene by arranging a meeting with Jacqueline in 1416, but Armagnac refused to allow Isabeau to reconcile with the House of Burgundy, while William II continued to prevent the young Dauphin from entering Paris.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} about Stefan's childhood. His family could not afford <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> a {{university}} abroad (only one of his brothers would do so); hence he embarked early on a military career. Before that, he attended a jesuit college, either in Kraków or Sandomierz, achieving a solid secondary education. After finishing his schooling, he became a courtier to then-royal prince and future king of Poland John II Casimir Vasa. As Stefan could not afford the equipment needed to join a hussar unit, he learned the art of war serving with the Lisowczycy mercenaries, joining them as towarzysz (companion, a junior cavalry officer) {{in the spring of}} 1621. Already an officer at the age of eighteen, he took part in the battle of Chocim (Khotyn) in 1621, where the Commonwealth army stopped the Ottomans and ended the Polish–Ottoman War (1620–21). His years with the brutal Lisowczycy mercenaries would impact his strategy in the latter years, where he would not hesitate to use any means necessary – including mistreatment of civilians – to achieve victory.|$|E
5|$|On 17 October 1820, news arrived {{that the}} {{military}} garrisons in Portugal had mutinied, leading to {{what became known as}} the Liberal Revolution of 1820. The military formed a provisional government, supplanting the regency appointed by JoãoVI, and summoned the Cortes—the centuries-old Portuguese parliament, this time democratically elected with the aim of creating a national Constitution. Pedro was surprised when his father not only asked for his advice, but also decided <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Portugal to rule as regent on his behalf and to placate the revolutionaries. The prince was never educated to rule and had previously been allowed no participation in state affairs. The role that was his by birthright was instead filled by his elder sister Dona Maria Teresa: JoãoVI had relied on her for advice, and it was she who had been given membership in the Council of State.|$|E

5|$|To {{strengthen}} the puppet government, Danckelmann {{wanted to find}} a Serb who was both well-known and highly regarded by the population who could raise some sort of Serbian armed force and who would be willing to use it ruthlessly against the rebels whilst remaining under full German control. In response to a request, the Foreign Office sent SS-Standartenführer Edmund Veesenmayer to provide assistance in establishing a new puppet government that would meet German requirements. Five months earlier, Veesenmayer had engineered the proclamation of the NDH. Veesenmayer engaged in a series of consultations with German commanders and officials in Belgrade, interviewed a number of possible candidates to lead the new puppet government, then selected former Yugoslav Minister of the Army and Navy General Milan Nedić as the best available. The Germans had to apply significant pressure to Nedić to encourage him to accept the position, including threats to bring Bulgarian and Hungarian troops into the occupied territory and <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Germany as a prisoner of war. Unlike most Yugoslav generals, Nedić had not been interned in Germany after the capitulation, but instead had been placed under house arrest in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|While Bissell showed early {{promise as}} a dancer, he also {{showed signs of}} being a troubled young man and began taking drugs {{at the age of}} 14. He was {{expelled}} from his first school for dealing drugs on the premises. He was noticed by the American ballet dancer Edward Villella, who encouraged his parents <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> a performing arts boarding school. In 1972 he joined the National Academy of Dance in Champaign, Illinois from which he was dismissed for behavior problems. Bissell then spent a year at the North Carolina School of the Arts which he left when he was informed that he should pay more attention to his academic studies. He hitch-hiked all the way to New York to pursue a lifelong career in dance as that's where the company's top schools are. He then won a scholarship to study at the School of American Ballet, where he was encouraged by Lincoln Kirstein, its founder, and Stanley Williams, one of his teachers. He was invented to join Balanchine's New York City Ballet and the American Ballet Theatre. He decided to join ABT and {{became a member of the}} corps. Though he quickly rose through the ranks.|$|E
