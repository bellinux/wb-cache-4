60|$|Among the regiments that marched {{that day}} to Ungheni was one to which I would draw special attention. It was not much better, perhaps, than the others, {{but it was a}} good typical Russian regiment, and had a {{commander}} at its head who looked as if he could do it justice. They marched at a smart pace, four miles an hour, with a long, dogged, steady tramp that was clumsy to look at, but seemed likely to last. Few of the men were tall, but they were burly, square-set fellows, broad of shoulder, deep of chest, and smart of limb. They wore a French-like blue cap, with a red band round it, and a blue tunic, with loose blue trousers stuffed into boots that reached the knee. Their knapsacks were hairy, and their belts black, the latter suggesting deliverance from that absurdity of old, pipeclay. Their great-coats, heavy and brown, were worn in a roll over the left shoulder, and each man carried his own kettle, the latter being suggestive of tea and <b>tuck-in,</b> followed by tobacco and turn-in.|$|E
6000|$|... "I went forward, {{and ordered}} the chain to be hauled in short, {{so as to be}} ready to trip the anchor and move the {{steamboat}} at once if necessary. 'Will they attack?' whispered an awed voice. 'We will be all butchered in this fog,' murmured another. The faces twitched with the strain, the hands trembled slightly, the eyes forgot to wink. It was very curious to see the contrast of expressions of the white men and of the black fellows of our crew, who were as much strangers to that part of the river as we, though their homes were only eight hundred miles away. The whites, of course greatly discomposed, had besides a curious look of being painfully shocked by such an outrageous row. The others had an alert, naturally interested expression; but their faces were essentially quiet, even those of the one or two who grinned as they hauled at the chain. Several exchanged short, grunting phrases, which seemed to settle the matter to their satisfaction. Their headman, a young, broad-chested black, severely draped in dark-blue fringed cloths, with fierce nostrils and his hair all done up artfully in oily ringlets, stood near me. 'Aha!' I said, just for good fellowship's sake. 'Catch 'im,' he snapped, with a bloodshot widening of his eyes and a flash of sharp teeth--'catch 'im. Give 'im to us.' 'To you, eh?' I asked; 'what would you do with them?' 'Eat 'im!' he said curtly, and, leaning his elbow on the rail, looked out into the fog in a dignified and profoundly pensive attitude. I would no doubt have been properly horrified, had it not occurred to me that he and his chaps must be very hungry: that they must have been growing increasingly hungry for at least this month past. They had been engaged for six months (I don't think a single one of them had any clear idea of time, as we at the end of countless ages have. They still belonged to the beginnings of time--had no inherited experience to teach them as it were), and of course, as long as there was a piece of paper written over in accordance with some farcical law or other made down the river, it didn't enter anybody's head to trouble how they would live. Certainly they had brought with them some rotten hippo-meat, which couldn't have lasted very long, anyway, even if the pilgrims hadn't, {{in the midst of a}} shocking hullabaloo, thrown a considerable quantity of it overboard. It looked like a high-handed proceeding; but it was really a case of legitimate self-defence. You can't breathe dead hippo waking, sleeping, and eating, and at the same time keep your precarious grip on existence. Besides that, they had given them every week three pieces of brass wire, each about nine inches long; and the theory was they were to buy their provisions with that currency in riverside villages. You can see how that worked. There were either no villages, or the people were hostile, or the director, who like the rest of us fed out of tins, with an occasional old he-goat thrown in, didn't want to stop the steamer for some more or less recondite reason. So, unless they swallowed the wire itself, or made loops of it to snare the fishes with, I don't see what good their extravagant salary could be to them. I must say it was paid with a regularity worthy of a large and honourable trading company. For the rest, the only thing to eat--though it didn't look eatable in the least--I saw in their possession was a few lumps of some stuff like half-cooked dough, of a dirty lavender colour, they kept wrapped in leaves, and now and then swallowed a piece of, but so small that it seemed done more for the looks of the thing than for any serious purpose of sustenance. Why in the name of all the gnawing devils of hunger they didn't go for us--they were thirty to five--and have a good <b>tuck-in</b> for once, amazes me now when I think of it. They were big powerful men, with not much capacity to weigh the consequences, with courage, with strength, even yet, though their skins were no longer glossy and their muscles no longer hard. And I saw that something restraining, one of those human secrets that baffle probability, had come into play there. I looked at them with a swift quickening of interest--not because it occurred to me I might be eaten by them before very long, though I own to you that just then I perceived--in a new light, as it were--how unwholesome the pilgrims looked, and I hoped, yes, I positively hoped, that my aspect was not so--what shall I say?--so--unappetizing: a touch of fantastic vanity which fitted well with the dream-sensation that pervaded all my days at that time. Perhaps I had a little fever, too. One can't live with one's finger everlastingly on one's pulse. I had often 'a little fever,' or a little touch of other things--the playful paw-strokes of the wilderness, the preliminary trifling before the more serious onslaught which came in due course. Yes; I looked at them as you would on any human being, with a curiosity of their impulses, motives, capacities, weaknesses, when brought to the test of an inexorable physical necessity. Restraint! What possible restraint? Was it superstition, disgust, patience, fear--or some kind of primitive honour? No fear can stand up to hunger, no patience can wear it out, disgust simply does not exist where hunger is; and as to superstition, beliefs, and what you may call principles, they are less than chaff in a breeze. Don't you know the devilry of lingering starvation, its exasperating torment, its black thoughts, its sombre and brooding ferocity? Well, I do. It takes a man all his inborn strength to fight hunger properly. It's really easier to face bereavement, dishonour, and the perdition of one's soul--than this kind of prolonged hunger. Sad, but true. And these chaps, too, had no earthly reason for any kind of scruple. Restraint! I would just as soon have expected restraint from a hyena prowling amongst the corpses of a battlefield. But there was the fact facing me--the fact dazzling, to be seen, like the foam on the depths of the sea, like a ripple on an unfathomable enigma, a mystery greater--when I thought of it--than the curious, inexplicable note of desperate grief in this savage clamour that had swept by us on the river-bank, behind the blind whiteness of the fog.|$|E

40|$|Evidence for the stereochemical {{isomerization}} of {{a variety}} of ansa metallocene compounds is presented. For the scandocene allyl derivatives described here, we have established that the process is promoted by a variety of salts in both ether and hydrocarbon solvents and is not accelerated by light. A plausible mechanism based on an earlier proposal by Marks, et al., is offered as an explanation of this process. It involves coordination of anions and/or donor solvents to the metal center with cation assistance to encourage metalcyclopentadienyl bond heterolysis, rotation about the Si-Cp bond of the detached cyclopentadienide and recoordination of the opposite face. Our observations in some cases of thermodynamic racemic:meso ratios under the reaction conditions commonly used for the synthesis of the metallocene chlorides suggests that the interchange is faster than metallation, such that the composition of the reaction mixture is determined by thermodynamic, not kinetic, control in these cases. Two new ansa-scandocene alkenyl compounds react with olefins resulting in the formation of η 3 -allyl complexes. Kinetics and labeling experiments indicate a <b>tuck-in</b> intermediate on the reaction pathway; in this intermediate the metal is bound to the carbon adjacent to the silyllinker {{in the rear of the}} metallocene wedge. In contrast, reaction of permethylscandocene alkenyl compounds with olefins results, almost exclusively, in vinylic C-H bond activation. It is proposed that relieving transition state steric interactions between the cyclopentadienyl rings and the olefin by either linking the rings together or using a larger lanthanide metal may allow for olefin coordination, stabilizing the transition state for allylic σ-bond metathesis. A selectively isotopically labeled propylene, CH 2 CD(13 CH 3), was synthesized and its polymerization was carried out at low concentration in toluene solution using isospecific metallocene catalysts. Analysis of the NMR spectra (13 C, 1 H, and 2 H) of the resultant polymers revealed that the production of stereoerrors through chain epimerization proceeds exclusively by the tertiaryalkyl mechanism. Additionally, enantiofacial inversion of the terminally unsaturated polymer chain occurs by a non-dissociative process. The implications of these results on the mechanism of olefin polymerization with these catalysts is discussed. </p...|$|E
