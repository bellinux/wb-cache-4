5|$|In February 1968, Lindsay {{estimated}} that there were about 500 to 700 Five Percenters. Some of Clarence13X's followers attempted to create break-away groups, proclaiming themselves prophets and starting their own movements. <b>They</b> <b>generally</b> retained aspects of Five Percenter doctrine with different emphases.|$|E
5|$|Pathogenic {{micro-organisms}} include bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They kill or debilitate {{their host}} and are relatively host-specific. Various microbial insect diseases occur naturally, {{but may also}} be used as biological pesticides. When naturally occurring, these outbreaks are density-dependent in that <b>they</b> <b>generally</b> only occur as insect populations become denser.|$|E
5|$|Several bear {{species are}} {{dangerous}} to humans, especially {{in areas where}} they have become used to people; elsewhere, <b>they</b> <b>generally</b> avoid humans. Injuries caused by bears are rare, but are widely reported. Bears may attack humans in response to being startled, in defense of young or food, or even for predatory reasons.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> are <b>generally</b> not toxic but {{considered}} non-edible due {{to their}} fibrous texture in the mature stage that <b>they</b> are <b>generally</b> found at.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> are <b>generally</b> {{responsive}} to IL-1β neutralisation.|$|R
50|$|Clifford algebras are superalgebras. <b>They</b> are <b>generally</b> noncommutative.|$|R
5|$|T. floccosus forms {{symbiotic}} (ectomycorrhizal) {{relationships with}} {{various types of}} conifer, growing in coniferous woodlands across Eastern Asia, from North Korea to Pakistan, and in North America, more frequently in the west, in late summer and autumn. Though mild-tasting, <b>they</b> <b>generally</b> cause gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea when consumed. T. floccosus is eaten by local people in northeastern India, Nepal and Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The Buckleyi Group {{contains}} all cultivars {{with at least}} some features clearly showing inheritance from S. russelliana: stem segments with rounded, more symmetrical teeth; more or less symmetrical (regular) flowers which hang down, below the horizontal; and pollen which is pink. <b>They</b> <b>generally</b> flower later than members of the Truncata Group {{and are more likely}} to be called Christmas cactus.|$|E
5|$|The katipo is {{restricted}} to a highly specialised habitat and is only found near the seashore living among sand dunes. <b>They</b> <b>generally</b> reside on the landward side of dunes closest to the coast where they are most sheltered from storms and sand movement. They can sometimes be associated with dunes several kilometres from the sea when these dunes extend inland for long distances.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> are <b>generally</b> {{classified}} {{among the}} Sepik languages.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> are <b>generally</b> {{stored in}} acid-free folders or boxes.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{there are}} many variations, <b>they</b> fall <b>generally</b> into two categories: ...|$|R
5|$|The {{second reason}} is the general path of {{tropical}} cyclones in the eastern Pacific. <b>They</b> <b>generally</b> move north-westward or westward due to steering by the prevailing upper level winds, which takes them far out to sea and away from land.|$|E
5|$|To be {{a member}} of the university, all students, and most {{academic}} staff, must also {{be a member}} of a college or hall. There are 38 colleges of the University of Oxford and six Permanent Private Halls, each controlling its membership and with its own internal structure and activities. Not all colleges offer all courses, but <b>they</b> <b>generally</b> cover a broad range of subjects.|$|E
5|$|Although Timoshenko's forces {{successfully}} regrouped on 21 May, {{he ordered}} a withdrawal of Army Group Kotenko {{by the end of}} 22 May, while he prepared an attack for 23 May, to be orchestrated by the 9th and 57th Armies. Although the Red Army desperately attempted to fend off advancing Wehrmacht and launched local counterattacks to relieve several surrounded units, <b>they</b> <b>generally</b> failed. By the end of May 24, Soviet forces opposite Kharkov had been surrounded by German formations, which had been able to transfer several more divisions to the front, increasing the pressure on the Soviet flanks and finally forcing them to collapse.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> are <b>generally</b> {{trouble-free}} and {{can even}} tolerate nibbling by deer’s.|$|R

50|$|Leuconostoc is a genus of Gram-positive bacteria, placed {{within the}} family of Leuconostocaceae. <b>They</b> are <b>generally</b> ovoid cocci often forming chains. Leuconostoc spp. are {{intrinsically}} resistant to vancomycin and are catalase-negative (which distinguishes them from staphylococci). All species within this genus are heterofermentative {{and are able to}} produce dextran from sucrose. <b>They</b> are <b>generally</b> slime-forming.|$|R
5|$|American kestrels are cavity nesters, {{but they}} are able to adapt {{to a wide variety of}} nesting situations. <b>They</b> <b>generally</b> prefer natural {{cavities}} (such as in trees) with closed tops and tight fitting entrances, as to provide for maximum protection of the eggs and young. Kestrels occasionally nest in holes created by large woodpeckers, or use the abandoned nests of other birds, such as red-tailed hawks, merlins, and crows. They have been recorded nesting on cliff ledges and building tops, as well as in abandoned cavities in cactuses. American kestrels also commonly utilize nesting boxes.|$|E
5|$|Green rosellas {{generally}} forage in {{the canopy}} or understory of forested areas, or in hedges, shrubs and trees in more open areas. They {{come to the}} ground to eat fallen fruit or spilt grain in orchards or farmland. They keep quiet while on the ground, and are quite noisy when in trees. Green rosellas forage in pairs or small groups of under 20 individuals, though larger groups of 50 to 70 have been observed at stands of blackberries or thistles in fields. When feeding, <b>they</b> <b>generally</b> hold food items in their left feet and extract edible parts or break and discard nut shells with their beaks.|$|E
5|$|In central New South Wales, the red wattlebird forages {{more often}} on the foliage of the grey gum (Eucalyptus punctata) over other trees, though it does also show some {{preference}} for narrow-leaved ironbark (E. crebra) if grey gum is not present. Red wattlebirds tend to oust noisy friarbirds (Philemon corniculatus) if both species were present. The red wattlebird often forages alongside the New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), little friarbird (P. citreogularis), western and little wattlebirds, rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus moluccanus), purple-crowned lorikeet (Glossopsitta porphyrocephala), satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus), pied currawong (Strepera graculina) and crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans), though <b>they</b> <b>generally</b> chase other nectar-feeding birds away from a horde of eucalypt flowers.|$|E
5|$|Heterodontiformes: <b>They</b> are <b>generally</b> {{referred}} to as the bullhead or horn sharks.|$|R
50|$|Chlorates are {{relatively}} toxic, though <b>they</b> form <b>generally</b> harmless chlorides on reduction.|$|R

5|$|Nevertheless, the {{benefits}} of more defensible forts are evident: they could act as temporary refuges for overwhelmed local troops during barbarian incursions, while they waited for reinforcements. The forts were difficult for the barbarians to take by assault, as <b>they</b> <b>generally</b> lacked the necessary equipment. The forts could store sufficient supplies to enable the defenders to hold {{out for a few}} weeks, and to supply relieving troops. They could also act as bases from which defenders could make sorties against isolated groups of barbarians and to cooperate with relieving forces.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo has {{released}} few technical details regarding the Wii system, but some key facts have leaked through the press. Although {{none of these}} reports has been officially confirmed, <b>they</b> <b>generally</b> indicate that the console is an extension (or advancement) of the Nintendo GameCube architecture. Specifically, the analyses report that the Wii is roughly 1.5 to 2times as powerful as its predecessor. Based on specifications, the Wii {{has been called the}} least powerful of the major home consoles of its generation.|$|E
5|$|Omphalea, {{like many}} {{other members of the}} Euphorbiaceae, {{possesses}} leaf nectaries that attract polistine wasps, which are predators of early instar caterpillars. The leaf nectaries also attract ants. The ants usually protect their host plant, eating both the nectar and plant-eating insects on it. However, <b>they</b> <b>generally</b> completely ignore Chrysiridia caterpillars, making it likely that the caterpillars possess a chemical deterrent as a primary defence. This chemical deterrent comes from the host plants. Omphalea species contain polyhydroxy alkaloids potentially sequestered or excreted by the caterpillar, the pupa and the adult moth.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> are <b>generally</b> {{found in}} {{vegetation}} such as shrubland, woodland and grassland.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> were <b>generally</b> small insectivorous animals. The {{most common}} genus is Hyopsodus.|$|R
5000|$|<b>They</b> are <b>generally</b> about 2 in long (although length varies), and thin.|$|R
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} of Dream Drop Distance is {{the inclusion of the}} Dream Eaters. Whilst <b>they</b> <b>generally</b> serve as the main enemies of the game, up to three good Dream Eaters, known as Spirits, can be recruited per character to assist them in battle. Spirits can be created by combining Dream Fragments together with an item or spell, either via experimenting with combinations or using recipes found throughout the game. Characters can also link with Spirits to perform unique attacks. Along the way, the player can care for these Spirits by petting them, feeding them items, or playing mini-games with them, which can unlock new abilities for the Spirits.|$|E
5|$|Riley wrote {{gentle and}} romantic poems {{that were not}} in dialect. <b>They</b> <b>generally</b> {{consisted}} of sonnets and were strongly influenced by the works of John Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson. His standard English poetry was never as popular as his Hoosier dialect poems. Still less popular were the poems Riley authored in his later years; most were to commemorate important events of American history and to eulogize the dead.|$|E
5|$|The Hawaiian monk seal, as {{the name}} suggests, lives solely in the Hawaiian archipelago. Monk seals {{migrated}} to Hawaii between 4–11 million years ago (mya) through an open water passage between North and South America called the Central American Seaway. The Isthmus of Panama closed the Seaway approximately 3 million years ago. The species may have evolved in the Pacific or Atlantic, but in either case, came to Hawaii long before the first Polynesians. When monk seals are not hunting or eating, <b>they</b> <b>generally</b> bask on the beaches; Hawaiian monk seals tend to bask on sandy beaches and volcanic rock of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands.|$|E
60|$|The Indians of the South American Pampas and Sierras {{are a very}} {{inferior}} race to the noble-looking Comanches and Apaches of the North American Prairies. <b>They</b> are <b>generally</b> short, wiry men, {{with long}} black hair. They have flat faces, with high cheek bones. Their complexion is a dark copper colour, and <b>they</b> are <b>generally</b> extremely ugly.|$|R
50|$|Tea chests were {{one-trip}} affairs, so <b>they</b> were <b>generally</b> {{sold for}} non-food use.|$|R
