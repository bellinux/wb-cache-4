50|$|A three-generation {{family is}} known in which two half-brothers were {{diagnosed}} with central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT).

A maternal uncle died in childhood from a brain tumor and a malignant rhabdoid <b>tumor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kidney.</b> The identification of two unaffected carriers in a family segregating a germline mutation and rhabdoid tumor supports the hypothesis {{that there may be}} variable risks of development of rhabdoid tumor {{in the context of a}} germline mutation.

40|$|AbstractSpindle cell/mesenchymal <b>tumors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> are rare. <b>The</b> {{diagnosis}} is supported mainly by <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> ancillary {{techniques such as}} immunohistochemistry (IH) and in-situ hybridization (FISH). An accurate {{diagnosis is}} essential because early management by complete resection and adjuvant chemotherapy improves the prognosis dramatically. Synovial sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor/Ewing sarcoma are infrequent malignancies which usually present in soft tissues but rarely in <b>the</b> <b>kidney.</b> <b>The</b> challenge for the pathologists is to histologically differentiate between different types of sarcomas such as PNET/Ewing’s sarcoma, sarcomatous dedifferentiated renal cell carcinoma, metastasis, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, nephroblastoma and angiomyolipoma. MethodsWe report from our experience six exemplary rare cases that presented in <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> as spindle/round cell tumors. ResultsWe have arrived at the accurate diagnosis after performing a large panel of IH and FISH. ConclusionIn summary we advise an immunohistochemical panel for round/spindle cell <b>tumors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> and for unclear cases we advise to add (FISH) to get the correct diagnosis, as they are completely different regarding surgical approach and post-operative adjuvant therapy...|$|R
40|$|The histology, ultrastructure, and {{messenger}} RNA {{expression of}} heterotransplants {{derived from the}} G 401 cell line (American Type Culture Collection) have been characterized by comparison with Wilms' and rhabdoid tumors of the kidney.

The G 401 cell line has been utilized in recent experiments to demonstrate the central role of chromosome 11 in Wilms' tumor.

40|$|Background. Renal onkocytoma is a {{distinctive}} benign tumor derived from epithelial cells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distal renal tubules. These tumors are often clinically asymptomatic, diagnosed accidentally {{and difficult to}} distinguish from renal cell carcinoma. Case report. We presented a giant renal onkocytoma in a man aged 64, without any signs or symptoms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urogenital system disorder. The preoperative diagnosis described <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right <b>kidney,</b> size 16 x 14 cm, and indicated a malignant <b>tumor</b> <b>of</b> <b>kidney.</b> <b>The</b> patient underwent radical nephrectomy.

Immunohystochemiclly, tumor cells were immunoreactive to CK AE 1 /AE 3 and CD 117, but showed negative immunoreactivity to CK 7, RCC marker and Vimentin. Conclusion. Giant renal oncocytomas are rare tumors with benign clinical course. As a rule, they are discovered by accident.
