25|$|The G36 {{employs a}} {{free-floating}} barrel (the barrel does not contact the handguard). The barrel is {{fastened to the}} receiver with a special nut, which can be removed with a wrench. The barrel is produced using a cold hammer forging process and features a chrome-lined bore with 6 right-hand grooves and a 1 in 178mm (1:7 in) rifling twist rate. <b>The</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly</b> consists of the gas block, a collar with a bayonet lug that {{is also used to}} launch rifle grenades and a slotted flash suppressor.|$|E
500|$|The barrel has a rifling {{twist rate}} of one turn in [...] Because firing heats up the bore, the {{air-cooled}} barrel {{is equipped with a}} mechanism to remove and replace <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly</b> with a spare. A folding bipod with adjustable legs is attached near the front of the weapon, though there are provisions for hard-mounting to a M192 Lightweight Ground Mount tripod or vehicle mount. The M249 provides accuracy approaching that of a rifle, combined with the sustained volume of fire of a machine gun. Its original gas regulator offered two different gas port sizes, allowing cyclic rates of fire of 725-rounds per minute (r/min) or 1,000r/min. The latter setting was intended for adverse conditions, such as an excessively dirty firearm or cold weather. The two-position gas regulator was discarded as part of a product improvement program. Sustained rate of fire, the rate of fire at which the gunner can fire continuously without overheating, is approximately 85r/min.|$|E
2500|$|After its {{introduction}} to service, reports of unserviceability of the M3 commenced in February 1944 with stateside units in training, who reported early {{failure of the}} cocking handle/bolt retraction mechanism on some weapons. [...] Similar reports later came from U.S. forces in Britain who were issued the M3. [...] An investigation revealed several deficiencies {{in the construction of}} the M3's bolt retraction mechanism, together with issues concerning barrel removal and retention as well as easily bent rear sights. [...] As a result, several product improvements were incorporated into all new M3 production, including a new design retracting pawl with improved heat treatment, a new spring stop fitted to the right-hand brace of the retracting lever, a modified ejector featuring a cocking lever trip, a larger ratchet pad with improved heat treatment to more securely retain <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly,</b> and strengthening gussets fitted to the sides of the fixed 'L' rear sight. [...] After new complaints were raised about accidental magazine releases and failure of the wire buttstock to remain in place in the collapsed position, two additional changes were made to M3 production and approved by Ordnance on 31 August 1944. [...] This included a small sheet metal guard around the magazine release button, and the inclusion of a stop between the two rods forming the wire stock at the butt end.|$|E
50|$|There {{also is a}} soda/beer can {{launcher}}. Unlike {{the golf}} ball launcher that screws onto the end of <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> where <b>the</b> AR-15/m16 family of rifles' flash hider attaches, the can launcher tube is fitted directly to the AR-15 upper receiver and is <b>the</b> entire <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly.</b> Both <b>the</b> golf ball launcher and can launcher require use of blank ammunition.|$|R

5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common type of single-shot action, usually found in shotguns, small pistols, and black-powder [...] "elephant" [...] guns, a break action connects <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly</b> to the {{breechblock}} with a hinge. When a locking latch is released, <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly</b> pivots away from the receiver, opening the breech and, at least on better firearms, partially extracting the spent cartridge.|$|E

5000|$|The four-shot pepperbox was {{introduced}} during the Allen and Wheelock era, highlighting that the pepperbox {{was still an}} important design {{through the end of}} the 1850s. A patent dated 1857 shows that <b>the</b> four-shot <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly</b> attached to <b>the</b> frame in a different manner than the six and five-shot pepperboxes.

50|$|These five {{components}} {{would be}} assembled by first transporting all five components {{to the target}} area, then loading the three uranium rings into the base assembly, then screwing <b>the</b> gun <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly</b> into <b>the</b> base. According to the article, two combination locks with different combinations were then activated by different team members, then the weapon could be armed and the timer set. Each component was reportedly heavy enough {{that it was a}} full load for one team member.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly</b> of the 2A18 gun {{is used by}} the 2S1 {{self-propelled}} howitzer. There {{are also}} Egyptian, Chinese, Serbian and Syrian self-propelled variants and conversions. The Syrian conversion utilizes the hull of a T-34 tank.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>barrel</b> {{survey results}} from the pre-assembly in Building 185 are reviewed. From these and the models {{developed}} to calculate the cylinder geometry we propose a minimal modification to the shimming plan for <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> calorimeter <b>assembly</b> in <b>the</b> Atlas cavern. At the precision of this calculation, we expect the tile calorimeter to be almost entirely within it design envelope. The focus of this note is the radial envelope. Based on the pre-assembly experience the tile calorimeter will fit comfortably within its envelope along the beam line...|$|R
5000|$|The 15.5x106 was FN's second {{effort to}} make a KPV {{competitor}} in the BRG-15, appropriately by necking out the KPV's case. It also utilized an unusual dual feed device (A la Hafdasa C-4), with link ammunition belts feeding from both the right and left. Spent shell casings were ejected out of {{the bottom of the}} gun, as in FN's later P90 personal defense weapon. <b>The</b> quick-change <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly</b> developed for <b>the</b> BRG-15 was redesigned for use in an updated version of the M2HB.|$|R
5000|$|A 3.5" [...] {{convertible}} {{model that}} came with two barrels: the standard one, and a separate longer barrel, which could be screwed onto the duplex fork mount {{in place of the}} standard one, and used as a distance microscope.

5000|$|With a rifle barrel mounted above a [...]410 shotgun barrel, this {{is known}} as a superposed [...] "over-under" [...] design. <b>The</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly</b> is {{connected}} to the stock/action group by means of a removable hinge pin. Whether folded or disassembled, the overall length for storage is approximately 18.5 inches.|$|E
50|$|The pistol has a {{double-action}} {{trigger and}} a rotating firing pin. Each {{pull of the}} trigger cocks and releases the hammer as well as rotating the firing pin to fire each chamber in succession. A top-mounted latch released <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly</b> to open forward. Mossberg provided a piece of bent sheet metal to extract spent casings.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{nearly all}} other firearms, {{there is no}} [...] "furniture" [...] on the M6 Scout like a butt stock or a forearm—the only parts which are not steel are the rubber butt plate and cheek rest. The M6 stock is stamped sheet steel, while <b>the</b> {{removable}} <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly</b> is forged steel. The stock holds four [...]410 shells and 15 [...]22 LR cartridges in the civilian version. The stock of the commercial version in [...]22 Hornet stores 12 rifle rounds and 4 shotgun shells. The original military stock held 9 [...]22 Hornet shells and 4 [...]410 shells. Aircrew who were issued the M6 were instructed on {{a way to make}} a field expedient forestock by wrapping <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> with a length of shroud line from their parachute.|$|R
50|$|The Pleter (named {{after the}} Slavonian town of Pleternica) was {{produced}} in the local factory OROPLET, heavily copied Sten Gun characteristics, despite having a vertical rather than horizontal magazine. These include <b>the</b> removable <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly,</b> <b>the</b> bolt and recoil spring, and the open bolt firing mechanism. Prototype models had handle and trigger pack cover made from wood, but in the serial production {{it was decided to}} use ones made from plastic. <b>Barrel</b> <b>assembly</b> was simplified compared to Sten gun, it was fixed by inbus screw, and to further simplify the construction, safety and fire selector was omitted. It was equipped with only simple sear/trigger/spring combination, making it open-bolt full auto only, but due to the relatively low rate of fire, skilled operator could fire single shots by quickly pulling and releasing the trigger.|$|R
5000|$|Almost all of Webley's {{subsequent}} revolvers {{were of a}} top-break design. A pivoting lever on {{the side}} of the gun's upper receiver was pressed to release <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> and cylinder <b>assembly,</b> which then tilts up and forward on a bottom-front pivot. After loading, the assembly is tilted back into firing position and locked closed.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{having a}} {{vertical}} magazine well (designed to accept 32-round double-feed direct copy of UZI magazine, rather than original single-feed Sten-type magazine), analogies with the Sten include {{a striking resemblance}} in <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly</b> and in the bolt and recoil spring. In addition, this gun also fires from an open bolt, and is further simplified by removing fire mode selector or any safety.|$|E
50|$|Changing {{caliber of}} CZ 807 assault rifle is simple: <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly,</b> bolt and firing pin, and the {{magazine}} are changed {{out in a}} field safe operation at the unit level. The trigger group of the CZ 807 has a magazine well that is for the 7.62x39mm magazines. To convert to 5.56x45mm, the only item needed for the lower (Trigger group) is the magazine well insert.|$|E
50|$|All guns have {{carriages}} or mountings {{that support}} <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly</b> (called the ordnance in some countries). Early guns {{could only be}} traversed by moving their entire carriage or mounting, and this lasted with heavy artillery into World War II. Mountings could be fitted into traversing turrets on ships, coast defences or tanks. From circa 1900 field artillery carriages provided traverse without moving the wheels and trail.|$|E
50|$|Most {{aircraft}} {{versions of}} the M61 are hydraulically driven and electrically primed. <b>The</b> gun rotor, <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly</b> and ammunition feed system are rotated by a hydraulic drive motor through a system of flexible drive shafts. The round is fired by an electric priming system where an electric current from a firing lead passes through the firing pin to the primer as each round is rotated into the firing position.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> ATLAS <b>barrel</b> toroid warm {{structure}} supports <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> toroid and <b>the</b> muon detectors. The warm {{structure is}} about 26 meters long with an outer diameter of 20 meters. In {{order to ensure}} the physics performance of the muon detectors, the deformation of the warm structure is minimised during the design phase. <b>The</b> <b>barrel</b> toroid <b>assembly</b> {{has been carried out}} in the cavern of the ATLAS experiment since end of 2004. In September 2005, the warm structure has been completely released. The release has been followed-up in real time using optical alignment sensors. Good agreement has been found within 1 mm, between the alignment system measurement, the geometer survey and the predicted values according to the finite element analyses results...|$|R
40|$|Jumbo. ” Two {{nuclear bomb}} designs were {{developed}} during WWII: the uranium- 235 -fueled gun barrel design “Little Boy, ” and the plutonium-fueled implosion design “Fat Man. ” <b>The</b> gun <b>barrel</b> design was sufficiently simple {{that it was}} never tested to full explosion before its use on Hiroshima. The Fat Man design, which ultimately fell on Nagasaki, was the more technically ambitious. Because <b>the</b> gun <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly</b> was too slow for plutonium, {{it was necessary to}} compress a spherical core of plutonium in a millionth of a second to supercritical density. This was done with a spherical arrangement of two kinds of conventional high explosives whose different burning rates focused the implosion and triggered the nuclear explosion of the plutonium. The production of the plutonium cores cost roughly a billion 1945 dollars...|$|R
50|$|The basic SUB-2000 {{design is}} {{implemented}} {{in a rather}} unusual folding design that folds for storage into half its total extended length. Folding is accomplished by pulling downward on the trigger guard and swinging <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly</b> back {{over the top of}} the rifle. A latch in the buttstock secures to the front sight housing, and the gun can be locked with a key in the folded position for added safety. The gun cannot be fired when folded.|$|E
50|$|The Skoda 150 mm Model 1918 {{was a heavy}} {{mountain}} howitzer, {{manufactured by}} Skoda Works. The design was begun during World War I, but the first prototype was completed as the war ended. After 1938, the Wehrmacht designated the few built as 15 cm GebH 18(t), although it's uncertain if they were actually used. The gun could be transported on six carts; each cart pulled by at least two horses or mules. <b>The</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly</b> required three towing animals.|$|E
50|$|The Type 98 50-mm mortar may {{be given}} the same care as would be given to US mortars.

Unscrew the thumb screws and remove the bipod feet from the traversing plate; then remove <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly</b> ball out of the socket in the base plate. Remove the collar which attaches the bipod to the barrel. To assemble the weapon, proceed in the reverse order.|$|E
40|$|As <b>the</b> <b>Barrel</b> Tile Calorimeter is constructed, {{the support}} saddles and the modules will be {{subjected}} to different forces, stresses, and deflections than when completely assembled. The purpose of this analysis {{is to examine the}} forces, stresses, and deflections acting on the support saddles and modules at various stages of assembly. The nominal weight of a barrel module is 20 tons. CERN Document number ATL-LB-EA- 0001 'Summary of the Structural Analysis of <b>the</b> <b>Barrel</b> Support Saddles' describes in detail the structural analysis of the saddles and <b>the</b> completed <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly.</b> These calculations followed Eurocode 3. This paper examined several load cases which occur during <b>the</b> <b>assembly</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Barrel.</b> <b>The</b> following are the main conclusions: (1) The assembly is not stable until 18 modules are in place, and only then can the support cradle be removed; (2) The forces between modules are nominal and are far less that the forces in the completed cylinder with 64 modules in place and the cryostat load applied; (3) All of the stresses in the connections between modules are within acceptable limits; and (4) The interface between the cryostat supports and the cryostat move approximately 1. 0 mm in the X and Y directions when the load of the cryostat is transferred to <b>the</b> <b>Barrel...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> quick {{detachable}} <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly</b> {{slides into}} to {{the receiver and}} attaches by a barrel-lock. On the original PK it was partially fluted to increase rigidity and improve heat dissipation. The barrel-lock also regulates {{the gap between the}} breech face and the breech end of <b>the</b> <b>barrel.</b> PK barrels have a folding carry handle/grip that is positioned {{to the left of the}} receiver and is used to transport the weapon and quickly and safely change-out barrels to prevent barrel overheating.The bore is chrome-lined and features 4 right-hand grooves at a 240 mm (1 in 9.45 in) rifling twist rate. The muzzle is threaded for the installation of various muzzle devices such as a flash hider. The muzzle was normally equipped with a conical flash suppressor that added 53 mm to <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> and later a long slotted flash suppressor that added 72 mm to <b>the</b> <b>barrel.</b> Later when <b>the</b> PKM variant was introduced <b>the</b> PK series <b>barrel</b> fluting was omitted and the muzzle device was changed to a shorter cylindrical slotted flash suppressor that added 40 mm to <b>the</b> <b>barrel.</b>|$|R
50|$|Open Slide Design. The {{primary role}} of the open-top slide {{was to provide a}} 180° {{ejection}} port. Open top slide virtually eliminated jamming or stovepiping. The slide retention device, which caused <b>the</b> slide and <b>barrel</b> <b>assembly</b> to remain open after the last cartridge had been fired and ejected, allowed the user to load the chamber one cartridge at a time (emergency tactical loading) should the magazine be lost or damaged. The pistols were designed so that the extractor would not be damaged by direct chamber loading. These models operated on the short recoil, delayed locking block system, which yielded a faster cycle time.|$|R
