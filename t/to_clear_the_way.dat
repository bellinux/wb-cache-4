5|$|Rastignac, {{who moved}} to Paris from the south of France, becomes {{attracted}} to the upper class. He has difficulty fitting in, but is tutored by his cousin, Madame de Beauséant, {{in the ways of}} high society. Rastignac endears himself to one of Goriot's daughters, Delphine, after extracting money from his own already-poor family. Vautrin, meanwhile, tries to convince Rastignac to pursue an unmarried woman named Victorine, whose family fortune is blocked only by her brother. He offers <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> for Rastignac by having the brother killed in a duel.|$|E
5|$|At 7 am on 7 April, the Viet Cong massed {{for another}} ground assault {{from the north}} and west of Lộc Ninh, with support from heavy artillery, tanks and armored {{personnel}} carriers. As the Viet Cong closed in, Vinh and his bodyguards ran out the opened gate and surrendered. Several South Vietnamese soldiers also tried to surrender, but they all returned to their positions after Smith stopped a South Vietnamese officer from raising a white T-shirt up the flagpole. By 8 am, the ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment was completely overwhelmed when the Viet Cong overran the southern compound with their superior numbers. At around 10 am, all tactical air support was called off in order <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> for B-52 strikes against Viet Cong formations west of Lộc Ninh. However, the B-52 strikes could not prevent the Viet Cong from overrunning Lộc Ninh. By 16:30, the Viet Cong were in complete control of Lộc Ninh District.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1927 season, Yorkshire secretary Frederick Toone approached Wilfred Rhodes to suggest that he should resign from his position as senior professional. Rhodes declined, prompted by his wife's suspicion of a plot against him. This may have been an attempt by Yorkshire <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> for a new captain. Lord Hawke was in favour of appointing Herbert Sutcliffe, a professional who had opened the batting for Yorkshire since 1919. In addition to Rhodes, other professionals on the side had debuted for Yorkshire earlier than Sutcliffe. However, Sutcliffe was unusual among professionals: he had received a commission in the British Army in the First World War, his appearance was always immaculate and when speaking he altered his accent to fit what he considered a better class of society. Such characteristics were more common among amateur cricketers, and Sutcliffe in many ways behaved like one. While not particularly popular with his teammates, he was respected.|$|E

5|$|The North Koreans now {{attempted}} a breakthrough of the Engineer position. After daylight, {{they were unable}} to get reinforcements into the fight since D Company commanded the town and its approaches. In this fight, which raged until 11:00, the engineers had neither artillery nor mortar support. D Company remedied this by using its new 3.5-inch and old 2.36-inch rocket launchers against the North Korean infantry. The fire of the 18 bazookas plus that from machine guns and the small arms of the company inflicted very heavy casualties on the North Koreans, who desperately tried <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> for a push eastward to Miryang. Tanks of A and B Companies, 72nd Tank Battalion, at the southern and eastern edge of Yongsan shared equally with the engineers in the intensity of this battle. The company commander was the only officer of D Company not killed or wounded in this melee, which cost the company 12 men killed and 18 wounded. The edge of Yongsan and the slopes of the hill south of the town became covered with North Korean dead and destroyed equipment.|$|E
5|$|Mehmed {{ordered his}} general, Suleiman Pasha, {{to end the}} siege of Venetian-controlled Shkodër (now in Albania), to {{assemble}} his troops in Sofia, {{and from there to}} advance with additional troops towards Moldavia. For these already exhausted Ottoman troops, who had besieged the city from 17 May to 15 August, the transit from Shkodër to Moldavia was a month's journey through bad weather and difficult terrain. According to Długosz, Suleiman was also ordered that after inflicting defeat on Stephen, he was to advance towards Poland, set camp for the winter, then invade Hungary in spring, and unite his forces with the army of the Sultan. The Ottoman army consisted of Janissaries and heavy infantry, which were supported by the heavy cavalry sipahis and by the light cavalry (akinci), who would scout ahead. There were also Tatar cavalry and other troops (such as the Timariots) from vassal states. Twenty thousand Bulgarian peasants were also included in the army; their main tasks were <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{for the rest of the}} army by building bridges over waters and removing snow from the roads, and to drive supply wagons. In total, the Ottoman cavalry numbered 30,000. In September 1474, the Ottoman army gathered in Sofia, and from there, Suleiman marched towards Moldavia by crossing the frozen Danube on foot. His first stop was Wallachia, which he entered via Vidin and Nicopolis. His army rested in Wallachia for two weeks, and was later met by a Wallachian contingent of 17,000 under Basarab Laiotă, who had changed sides to join the Ottomans.|$|E

5000|$|The {{impact that}} the {{original}} Spanish system of colonization had on modern day California cannot be overstated.

25|$|After {{the defeat}} of France the High Command (OKW) felt they had won the war, and some more {{pressure}} would persuade Britain. On 30 June the OKW Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl issued his paper setting out options: the first was to increase attacks on shipping, economic targets and the RAF: air attacks and food shortages were expected to break morale and lead to capitulation. Destruction of the RAF was the first priority, and invasion would be a last resort. Hermann Göring's operational directive issued the same day ordered destruction of the RAF <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> for attacks cutting off seaborne supplies to Britain.

25|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2004 campaign, the Democratic Party in Arizona tapped Paul Babbitt, Coconino County commissioner and the brother of Bruce Babbitt, {{to run for the}} seat and pressured all other candidates with the exception of political unknown Bob Donahue to bow out of the primary in order <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> for Babbitt to run against Renzi without a costly primary contest. Paul Babbitt's campaign was named a top national priority by most major Democratic fundraisers and liberal weblogs, because a plurality of Arizona 1st Congressional District voters are registered Democrats and because Renzi won so narrowly in 2002. Unlike the Cordova campaign in 2002, which received only token support from the national Democratic Party organizations, the Babbitt campaign received major support; nonetheless, it was unable to match Renzi's fundraising.|$|E

50|$|Soft-tissue fossils, such {{as those}} found in the Burgess Shale, are rare. In some cases their {{internal}} organs are replicated in phosphate.

Scheduled for 3 August 1970, foul weather would delay the start until the 18th. Then Bataillon Guerrier 227 (BG 227) was helilifted into position northwest of North Vietnamese troops from Ban Na with the expectation of driving them from the position. However, nonflying weather reoccurred, and the attack was deprived of tactical air support. The small People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) garrison resisted vigorously; without air power, BG 227 was unsuccessful.|$|E

Only after passage of the extra budget for fiscal 2009 in May and facing internal pressure from the LDP after a series of defeats in regional elections – most notably the Tokyo prefectural election on 12 July – he decided to announce a general election for 30 August 2009. He dissolved the House of Representatives on 21 July 2009. The LDP lost by a landslide to Democratic Party of Japan, in the face of record levels of post-war unemployment. Accepting responsibility for the worst (and second-only) defeat of a sitting government in modern Japanese history, Asō immediately resigned as LDP president.|$|E

After being held through the day, late in the afternoon another attack by the 60th (London) and the Australian Mounted Divisions captured the Ottoman rearguard. This attack, along with the occupation of Gaza during the morning, broke the Ottoman line.
