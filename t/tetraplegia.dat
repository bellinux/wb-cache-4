5|$|The {{medical costs}} for catastrophic {{injuries}} {{can be extremely}} high—a 2011 estimate from the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center notes that first-year costs {{of someone who has}} high <b>tetraplegia,</b> an injury that causes partial or full loss of use in all limbs, is USD $1,044,097, with subsequent years costing $181,328. Many high schools across the United States require students to have an insurance policy, while others offer supplementary insurance to help offset the cost; some schools also request that boosters help families pay for these policies.|$|E
5|$|At {{each level}} of the spinal column, spinal nerves branch off from {{either side of the}} spinal cord and exit between a pair of vertebrae, to {{innervate}} a specific part of the body. The area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve is called a dermatome, and the group of muscles innervated by a single spinal nerve is called a myotome. The part of the spinal cord that was damaged corresponds to the spinal nerves at that level and below. Injuries can be cervical 1–8 (C1–C8), thoracic 1–12 (T1–T12), lumbar 1–5 (L1–L5), or sacral (S1–S5). A person's level of injury is defined as the lowest level of full sensation and function. Paraplegia occurs when the legs are affected by the spinal cord damage (in thoracic, lumbar, or sacral injuries), and <b>tetraplegia</b> occurs when all four limbs are affected (cervical damage).|$|E

25|$|In 2007 a {{resolution}} was presented and accepted {{at the world}} congress in reconstructive hand surgery and rehabilitation in <b>tetraplegia,</b> that stated that every patient with <b>tetraplegia</b> should be examined and informed about the options for reconstructive surgery of the tetraplegic arms and hands. This resolution demonstrates mostly the necessity to increase the awareness on this subject amongst physicians.|$|E
25|$|A large {{survey in}} {{patients}} with <b>tetraplegia</b> demonstrated that these patients give preference to improving upper extremity function above other lost functions like being able to walk or sexual function.|$|E
25|$|A {{common goal}} of {{surgical}} {{reconstruction of the}} arms in patients with <b>tetraplegia</b> is to restore elbow extension, key pinch and palmar grip. Restoration of these functions, results in increasing a patient's independence.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of hand surgery for <b>tetraplegia</b> has received important contributions through published reports {{and by the}} international conferences initiated with the inﬂuence of Erik Moberg from Goteborg, Sweden. Conferences have been of great interest because of the convergences of hand surgeons interested in the ﬁeld, promoting discussion and comparison of different surgical methods and experiences.|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{research}} teams {{led by the}} Braingate group at Brown University and a group led by University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, both in collaborations with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, have demonstrated further success in direct control of robotic prosthetic limbs with many degrees of freedom using direct connections to arrays of neurons in the motor cortex of patients with <b>tetraplegia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Spastic <b>tetraplegia</b> (all four limbs {{affected}} equally). People with spastic quadriplegia are {{the least}} {{likely to be able to}} walk, or if they can, to want to walk, because their muscles are too tight and it is too much effort to do so. Some children with quadriplegia also have hemiparetic tremors, an uncontrollable shaking that affects the limbs on one side of the body and impairs normal movement.|$|E
25|$|The deltoid {{muscle is}} usually innervated {{by the fifth}} and sixth {{cervical}} nerve roots and is therefore often functional in patients with <b>tetraplegia,</b> though the triceps muscle, which is innervated by the seventh cervical root, is paralysed. Because of the location {{at the back of}} the arm, the posterior part of the deltoid muscle can give strength in the same direction as the triceps muscle and is therefore theoretically a good donor to regain elbow extension.|$|E
500|$|A {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) is damage to the spinal cord that causes changes in its function, either {{temporary}} or permanent. These changes translate into loss of muscle function, sensation, or autonomic function {{in parts of the}} body served by the spinal cord below the level of the lesion. Injuries can occur at any level of the spinal cord and can be classified as complete injury, a total loss of sensation and muscle function, or incomplete, meaning some nervous signals are able to travel past the injured area of the cord. [...] Depending on the location and severity of damage along the spinal cord, the symptoms can vary widely, from pain or numbness to paralysis to incontinence. [...] The prognosis also ranges widely, from full recovery in rare cases to permanent <b>tetraplegia</b> (also called quadriplegia) in [...] injuries {{at the level of the}} neck, and paraplegia in lower injuries. Complications that can occur in the short and long term after injury include muscle atrophy, pressure sores, infections, and respiratory problems.|$|E
500|$|Brain-computer {{interfaces}} (BCIs) are {{a developing}} technology that clinicians hope {{will one day}} bring more independence and agency to the severely physically disabled. Those the technology {{has the potential to}} help include people with near-total or total paralysis, such as those with <b>tetraplegia</b> (quadriplegia) or advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); BCIs are intended to help them to communicate or even move objects such as motorized wheelchairs, neuroprostheses, or robotic grasping tools. Few of these technologies are currently in regular use by people with disabilities, but a diverse array are in development at an experimental level. One type of BCI uses event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the mu wave in order to control the computer. This method of monitoring brain activity takes advantage of the fact that when a group of neurons is at rest they tend to fire in synchrony with each other. When a participant is cued to imagine movement (an [...] "event"), the resulting desynchronization (the group of neurons that was firing in synchronous waves now firing in complex and individualized patterns) can be reliably detected and analyzed by a computer. Users of such an interface are trained in visualizing movements, typically of the foot, hand, and/or tongue, which are each in different locations on the cortical homunculus and thus distinguishable by an electroencephalograph (EEG) or electrocorticograph (ECoG) recording of electrical activity over the motor cortex. In this method, computers monitor for a typical pattern of mu wave ERD contralateral to the visualized movement combined with event-related synchronization (ERS) in the surrounding tissue. This paired pattern intensifies with training, and the training increasingly takes the form of games, some of which utilize virtual reality. Some researchers have found that the feedback from virtual reality games is particularly effective in giving the user tools to improve control of his or her mu wave patterns. The ERD method can be combined with one or more other methods of monitoring the brain's electrical activity to create hybrid BCIs, which often offer more flexibility than a BCI that uses any single monitoring method.|$|E
2500|$|According to Zancolli, {{transfer}} of the m. brachioradialis to the m. extensor carpi radialis tendons was proposed by Vulpius and Stoffel in 1920. In <b>tetraplegia,</b> this was ﬁrst proposed by Wilson. [...] and ﬁrst described fully by Freehafer.|$|E
2500|$|Elbow {{extension}} is {{an important}} part of upper limb surgical reconstruction in patients with <b>tetraplegia.</b> [...] Although gravity can extend the arm, active elbow extension is needed to maintain a stable arm while extended in space. This is needed to reach for something or replace an object. Other functional gains include: increasing available workspace, performing pressure relief maneuvers, propelling a manual wheelchair, enhancing self-care and leisure activities, and promoting independent transfer. Elbow extension against gravity further enhances these activities above the shoulder level and reachable workspace.|$|E
2500|$|Non-invasive BCIs {{have also}} been applied to enable brain-control of {{prosthetic}} upper and lower extremity devices in people with paralysis. For example, Gert Pfurtscheller of Graz University of Technology and colleagues demonstrated a BCI-controlled functional electrical stimulation system to restore upper extremity movements in a person with <b>tetraplegia</b> due to spinal cord injury. Between 2012 and 2013, researchers at the University of California, Irvine demonstrated {{for the first time}} that it is possible to use BCI technology to restore brain-controlled walking after spinal cord injury. In their spinal cord injury research study, a person with paraplegia was able to operate a BCI-robotic gait orthosis to regain basic brain-controlled ambulation.|$|E
2500|$|The term palsy {{in modern}} {{language}} {{refers to a}} disorder of movement, but the word root [...] "palsy" [...] technically means [...] "paralysis", {{even though it is}} not used as such within the meaning of cerebral palsy. The use of [...] "palsy" [...] in the term cerebral palsy makes it important to note that paralytic disorders are in fact not cerebral palsy– meaning that the condition of <b>tetraplegia,</b> which comes from spinal cord injury or traumatic brain injury, {{should not be confused with}} spastic quadriplegia, which does not, nor should tardive dyskinesia be confused with dyskinetic cerebral palsy or the condition of (paralytic) [...] "diplegia" [...] with spastic diplegia. In fact, as of the early 21st century some clinicians have become so distressed at common incorrect use of these terms that they have resorted to new naming schemes rather than trying to reclaim the classic ones; one such example of this evolution is the increasing use of the term bilateral spasticity to refer to spastic diplegia. Such clinicians even argue quite often that the [...] "new" [...] term is technically more clinically accurate than the established term.|$|E

5000|$|The {{condition}} of paralysis affecting four limbs is alternately termed <b>tetraplegia</b> or quadriplegia. Quadriplegia combines the Latin root quadra, for [...] "four", with the Greek root πληγία plegia, for [...] "paralysis". <b>Tetraplegia</b> uses the Greek root τετρα tetra for [...] "four".

50|$|For most {{patients}} with ASIA A (complete) <b>tetraplegia,</b> ASIA B (incomplete) <b>tetraplegia</b> and ASIA C (incomplete) <b>tetraplegia,</b> the International Classification {{level of the}} patient can be established without great difficulty. The surgical procedures according to the International Classification level can be performed. In contrast, for patients with ASIA D (incomplete) <b>tetraplegia</b> {{it is difficult to}} assign an International Classification other than International Classification level X (others). Therefore, it is more difficult to decide which surgical procedures should be performed. A far more personalized approach is needed for these patients. Decisions must be based more on experience than on texts or journals.|$|E
