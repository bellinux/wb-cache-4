5|$|Burges's two finest gothic {{churches were}} also {{undertaken}} in the 1870s, <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> the Consoler, Skelton-on-Ure, and St Mary's, Studley Royal. His patron, George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon, although not as rich as Bute, was his equal in romantic medievalism and had been a friend of Bute's at Oxford, which {{may account for the}} choice of Burges as architect. Both churches were built as memorial churches for Ripon's brother-in-law, Frederick Grantham Vyner, who was murdered by Greek bandits in 1870. Vyner's mother commissioned <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> the Consoler and his sister St Mary's. Both begun in 1870, Skelton was consecrated in 1876 and Studley Royal in 1878.|$|E
5|$|Founded in April 1879, <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ,</b> Scientist {{is led by}} a {{president}} and five-person board of directors. There is a public-relations department, known as the Committee on Publication, with representatives around the world; this {{was set up by}} Eddy in 1898 to protect her own and the church's reputation. The church was accused in the 1990s of silencing internal criticism by firing staff, delisting practitioners and excommunicating members.|$|E

5000|$|With the {{resignation}} of McKean, some efforts are being made at reconciliation between <b>the</b> International <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> and <b>the</b> mainstream <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ.</b> In March 2004, Abilene Christian University held the [...] "Faithful Conversations" [...] dialog between members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> and International <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ.</b> Those involved were able to apologize and initiate an environment conducive to building bridges. A few leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> apologized {{for use of the}} word [...] "cult" [...] in reference to <b>the</b> International <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ.</b> <b>The</b> International <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> leaders apologized for alienating <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> and implying they were not Christians. Despite improvements in relations, there are still fundamental differences within the fellowship. Early 2005 saw a second set of dialogs with greater promise for both sides helping one another. Harding University is contemplating a distance learning program geared toward those ministers who were trained in <b>the</b> International <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ.</b> A video chronicling the [...] "First forty years of the ICOC" [...] details these developments.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ,</b> Scientist has no clergy, sermons or rituals, and {{performs}} no baptisms, marriages or burials. Its main religious {{texts are}} the Bible and Science and Health. Each church has two Readers, who read aloud from those texts during services, and select hymns from the Christian Science Hymnal. There are Sunday morning and Wednesday evening services. Members offer testimonials during the Wednesday meetings about any success they attribute to Christian Science, including recovery from ill health.|$|E
5|$|The Union Church {{was formed}} in 1862, with John Rylands as its patron; he laid the {{foundation}} stone of its building in Edge Lane, close to Longford Park's southern entrance, in 1867. In {{the latter part of}} the 20th century the church was converted into office accommodation but by the early 21st century was standing empty. In 2012 it was restored to its original use a church having been bought by <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> – Iglesia ni Cristo.|$|E
5|$|Eddy and 26 {{followers}} {{were granted}} a charter in 1879 to found <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ,</b> Scientist, and in 1894 the Mother Church, The First Church of Christ, Scientist, {{was built in}} Boston, Massachusetts. Christian Science became the fastest growing religion in the United States, with nearly 270,000 members by 1936, a figure that had declined by 1990 to just over 100,000. The church {{is known for its}} newspaper, the Christian Science Monitor, which won seven Pulitzer Prizes between 1950 and 2002, and for its Reading Rooms, which {{are open to the public}} in around 1,200 cities.|$|E
50|$|The Restoration Movement {{has since}} divided into {{multiple}} separate groups. There are three main branches in <b>the</b> US: <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ,</b> <b>the</b> Christian <b>churches</b> and <b>churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ,</b> and <b>the</b> Christian <b>Church</b> (Disciples <b>of</b> <b>Christ).</b> Other U.S. based groups {{affiliated with the}} movement are <b>the</b> International <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> and <b>the</b> International Christian <b>Churches.</b> Non-U.S. groups include <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> in Australia, <b>the</b> Evangelical Christian <b>Church</b> in Canada, <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> in Europe. <b>The</b> Plymouth Brethren are a similar though historically unrelated group which originated in the United Kingdom.

50|$|Sommer's {{conversion}} to <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> occurred {{long before the}} formal division from the Disciples <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> in 1906, so that references to <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> in this section must be understood {{to refer to the}} older, larger body.|$|R

5|$|The eight strongest {{religious}} affiliations in {{the area}} (based on the 2006 census figures) were (in descending order): Anglican, Catholic, Uniting, Lutheran, Orthodox Christian, Buddhist, Presbyterian, Church of Christ and Baptist (a combination of other Christian faiths came in somewhere between Presbyterians and <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ,</b> with 31 adherents). Also of note is the high occurrence of religious affiliation (67.3%) in the region {{in comparison to the}} Adelaide (and national) average. Christian belief (64.4%) is most prominent, with little growth in other religions.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} church {{within this}} movement, founded in April 1830 in New York by Joseph Smith, was <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ,</b> which was later named the Church of the Latter Day Saints. It was renamed the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1838 (stylized as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the United Kingdom), which remained its official name until Smith's death in 1844. This organization subsequently splintered into several different denominations, {{each of which}} {{claims to be the}} legitimate continuation of this original church, and most of which dispute the right of other denominations within the movement to claim this distinction.|$|E
5|$|Born, raised, {{and educated}} in Los Angeles, Kemp {{was the third}} of four sons of Frances Elizabeth (née Pope) and Paul Robert Kemp Sr. Paul turned his {{motorcycle}} messenger service into a trucking company that grew from one to 14 trucks. Frances was a well-educated social worker and Spanish teacher. Kemp {{grew up in the}} heavily Jewish Wilshire district of West Los Angeles, but his tight-knit middle-class family attended <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ,</b> Scientist. In his youth, sports consumed Kemp, who once chose the forward pass as the subject of a school essay on important inventions, although his mother attempted to broaden his horizons with piano lessons and trips to the Hollywood Bowl.|$|E
50|$|Independent Christian <b>churches</b> and <b>churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> {{have both}} {{organizational}} and hermeneutic differences with <b>the</b> <b>churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ.</b> For example, {{they have a}} loosely organized convention, and they view scriptural silence on an issue more permissively. Nonetheless, {{they are much more}} closely related to <b>the</b> <b>churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> in their theology and ecclesiology than they are with <b>the</b> Christian <b>Church</b> (Disciples <b>of</b> <b>Christ).</b>|$|R
50|$|The Restoration Movement {{has since}} divided into {{multiple}} separate groups. There are three main branches in <b>the</b> U.S.: <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ,</b> <b>the</b> unaffiliated Christian Church/Church <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> congregations, and <b>the</b> Christian <b>Church</b> (Disciples <b>of</b> <b>Christ).</b> Some characterize the {{divisions in the}} movement {{as the result of}} the tension between the goals of restoration and ecumenism: <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> and unaffiliated Christian Church/Church <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> congregations resolved the tension by stressing restoration, while <b>the</b> Christian <b>Church</b> (Disciples <b>of</b> <b>Christ)</b> resolved <b>the</b> tension by stressing ecumenism. A number of groups outside the U.S. also have historical associations with this movement, such as <b>the</b> Evangelical Christian <b>Church</b> in Canada and <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> in Australia.|$|R

5|$|Burges's {{career was}} short but illustrious; {{he won his}} first major {{commission}} for Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral in Cork in 1863, when he was 35, and he died, in 1881, at his Kensington home, The Tower House, aged only 53. His architectural output was small but varied. Working with a long-standing team of craftsmen, he built churches, a cathedral, a warehouse, a university, a school, houses and castles. Burges's most notable works are Cardiff Castle, constructed between 1866 and 1928, and Castell Coch (1872–91), both of which were built for John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute. Other significant buildings include Gayhurst House, Buckinghamshire (1858–65), Knightshayes Court (1867–74), <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> the Consoler (1870–76), St Mary's, Studley Royal (1870–78), in Yorkshire, and Park House, Cardiff (1871–80).|$|E
5|$|Justinian's Chalke was a {{rectangular}} building, with four engaged piers supporting a central dome on pendentives, {{which in turn}} rested on four barrel arches in the typical Byzantine fashion. The piers {{to the south and}} north were somewhat lower than those to the east and west. The central structure was adjoined by two smaller chambers on either side to the south and north, each again featuring a vaulted roof. The relation of <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> Chalkites with the gate is unclear; Cyril Mango suggested that it was located to its left, but it has also been proposed that it was actually built atop the gatehouse itself. It is known that the chapel was placed atop an elevated platform, and 18th-century depictions locate it some 100 m southeast of the Hagia Sophia.|$|E
5|$|The {{completed}} work, {{titled the}} Book of Mormon, {{was published in}} Palmyra on March 26, 1830, by printer E. B. Grandin. Soon after, on April 6, 1830, Smith and his followers formally organized <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ,</b> and small branches were established in Palmyra, Fayette, and Colesville, New York. The Book of Mormon brought Smith regional notoriety and opposition from those who remembered his money-digging and the 1826 Chenango County trial. After Cowdery baptized several new church members, the Mormons received threats of mob violence; before Smith could confirm the newly baptized members, {{he was arrested and}} brought to trial as a disorderly person. He was acquitted, but soon both he and Cowdery fled to Colesville to escape a gathering mob. In probable reference to this period of flight, Smith said that Peter, James, and John had appeared to him and had ordained him and Cowdery to a higher priesthood.|$|E

5|$|The best-known {{feature of}} <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> Pantocrator is {{the rich and}} {{colourful}} decoration of its exterior walls. The most lavishly decorated part {{of the church is}} the east side with the apse, and as a whole all sides of the church exhibit different ornamentation. Interchanging strips of three or four rows of bricks and carved stones, which create an optical pattern, are the most basic type of decoration used. Rows of blind arches, four-leaved floral motifs, triangular ornaments, circular turquoise ceramics and brick swastika friezes run along the east wall. Ousterhout likens the appearance of the church's superimposed arcades to an aqueduct; an earlier example of that configuration can be observed in the Cappadocian church of Çanlı Kilise near Aksaray, Turkey. The inclusion of swastikas in the decoration is considered unusual and curious to tourists. It is explained by the medieval use of the swastika {{as a symbol of the}} Sun.|$|E
