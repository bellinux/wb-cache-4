40|$|In {{the lecture}} {{is given a}} survey of the fishmealproduction in Norway in 1951, and how <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>distributes</b> between <b>the</b> {{different}} kinds of rawmaterials. Then there are mentioned what requirements the methods of production ought to satisfy. After that are discussed the different methods of fishmealproduction, old and new. The methods are classified in two principal groups: 1) only for lean rawmaterial, and 2) both for lean and fat rawmaterial. In the first group are discussed a) the so-called «old method» with cooking, pressing and loss of the pressliquid, b) the «Vega»-method for «wholemeal»-production and c) the Schlotterhose-method for «wholemeal»-production. Drying in rotating direct fire-gasheated drumdriers are specially discussed because this is the most used drying-method in Norway and often are run in a wrong manner. Directions for correct operation are given. Then are discussed the different methods for processing fat materials, such as a) the «old method», b) the Notevarp-method, c) the Lysøysund-method, d) the «evaporation-method», e) the Fleslandmethod (H-method), f) the Nygårds-method, g) extraction and h) wet-extraction (VE-method).

For example, some units respond vigorously to a border or edge in a particular orientation, but are unresponsive to that same border {{after it has been}} rotated through some angle. Other units respond selectively to objects which move through their receptive fields in different directions. While these "tuned" units vary considerably in the particular stimulus attribute or combination of attributes to which they are responsive, almost all of them seem to share two general properties. First, these units are unresponsive to homogeneous illumination of their receptive fields. Second, while they are not sensitive to <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> of uniformly <b>distributed</b> light, their responses are influenced by changes in the contrast of their "preferred " stimuli. As a result of the contrast sensitivity of these units, systematic variation of stimulus contrast should be considered a major tool for studying the response characteristics of similarly "tuned " elements in human vision.

25|$|Oxygen {{consumption}} (VO2) {{during exercise}} is best {{described by the}} Fick Equation: VO2=Q x (a-vO2diff), which states {{that the amount of}} oxygen consumed is equal to cardiac output (Q) multiplied by the difference between arterial and venous oxygen concentrations. More simply put, oxygen consumption is dictated by <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> of blood <b>distributed</b> by the heart as well as the working muscle's ability to take up the oxygen within that blood; however, this is a bit of an oversimplification. Although cardiac output is thought to be the limiting factor of this relationship in healthy individuals, {{it is not the only}} determinant of VO2 max. That is, factors such as the ability of the lung to oxygenate the blood must also be considered. Various pathologies and anomalies cause conditions such as diffusion limitation, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, and pulmonary shunts that can limit oxygenation of the blood and therefore oxygen distribution. In addition, the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood is also an important determinant of the equation. Oxygen carrying capacity is often the target of exercise (ergogenic aids) aids used in endurance sports to increase the volume percentage of red blood cells (hematocrit), such as through blood doping or the use of erythropoietin (EPO). Furthermore, peripheral oxygen uptake is reliant on a rerouting of blood flow from relatively inactive viscera to the working skeletal muscles, and within the skeletal muscle, capillary to muscle fiber ratio influences oxygen extraction.|$|R

To reduce its contribution without limiting <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> of goods <b>distributed,</b> <b>the</b> technological improvement of vehicles and alternative fuels is only a partial solution. Indeed, it should be flanked by other integrative push- and pull-measures implemented at the policy level. Among them, eco-driving represents an option that covers strategic, tactical and operational decisions and provides suggestions to drivers, as well as real-time monitoring of their performance. This paper brings some evidence to such assertion, first providing {{a summary of the}} literature assessing the impacts of eco-driving, and then highlighting the limited amount of studies regarding freight transport. The results of an eco-driving field trial conducted in the Chinese province of Jiangsu, whose data were gathered using a method based on real-time normalized indicators specifically developed by Deutsche Telekom AG, are then presented. 15 heavy-duty and 10 light commercial vehicles were monitored over a period of four months, and information was collected on more than 5200 trips, covering a total distance of 439, 000 km. A comparison between the driving styles before and after the training revealed a reduction of unitary fuel consumption for heavy-duty vehicles (− 5. 5 %), while no significant variations were visible for light commercial vehicles. The application of this research method also yielded useful information about braking, acceleration and standstill, which are normally not considered in these types of evaluations, but can be highly valuable to drivers who wish to modify their behaviour towards a more efficient style of drivin...|$|R
