5|$|A new {{construction}} technique {{was employed to}} save weight. Previous battlecruisers were built {{with a combination of}} transverse and longitudinal steel frames; the Derfflinger-class ships dispensed with the transverse frames and used only <b>the</b> <b>longitudinal</b> ones. This enabled the ship to retain structural strength and a lower weight. As with all preceding capital ships, the outer hull spaces between the hull wall and the torpedo bulkhead were used for coal storage.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} {{situated}} {{in the middle of}} the fortress' territory along <b>the</b> <b>longitudinal</b> axis. It belongs to the domed basilica type of churches, where the bearings join with the side-chapels of the apse. Two pairs of arches divided <b>the</b> <b>longitudinal</b> stretched prayer hall into three naves, the central one of which (with double side-chapels) on the eastern side ends with low staged, half-rounded apse and the side-chapels end with sacristies. They are characterized with stylish iconography, richness of theme and variety of different colors (where blue is dominant). The vertical axis of the building was crowned by a massive dome. The pointed dome with the cylindrical drum has not survived. It was damaged during Tamerlane's invasion and completely demolished in 1784 when the Avar Omar Khan invaded the Transcaucasus from Dagestan. In the 19th century, Viceroy of the Caucasus, Prince Mikhail Vorontsov built a semi-spherical wooden dome covered with iron sheets in place of the original dome. The dome was renovated during Soviet years.|$|E
5|$|The {{new rules}} {{adopted in the}} 1997 annexes to the SOLAS {{convention}} focused on problems such as reinforcing bulkheads and <b>the</b> <b>longitudinal</b> frame, more stringent inspections (with a particular focus on corrosion) and routine in-port inspections. The 1997 additions also required bulkers with restrictions (for instance, forbidden from carrying certain types of cargoes) to mark their hulls with large, easy-to-see triangles.|$|E
50|$|Sculpture: Longitudinals—the whole {{surface is}} covered with strong, puckered, oblique lines of growth, which are {{sharp-edged}} but flattened,. They are rather regular, with many minuter ones in <b>the</b> intervals. <b>The</b> <b>longitudinals</b> are crosshatched with spirals, which are stronger and more regular, but not perfectly uniform. They consist of square threads and furrows of equal breadth, and both scored by <b>the</b> <b>longitudinals.</b> On <b>the</b> earlier whorls these spirals disappear before <b>the</b> <b>longitudinals</b> do. And {{on the base of}} the shell they become on the outside feebler, closer, and finer, in the middle broader and flatter, and stronger again toward the centre of the shell.|$|R
40|$|AbstractInspection of {{cylindrical}} structures using <b>the</b> first <b>longitudinal</b> Ultrasonic Guided Wave (UGW) mode has so {{far been}} predominantly neglected. This is due to its attenuative and dispersive behaviour, at common UGW operating frequencies (20 - 100 kHz). However, with the current knowledge on the level of attenuation in <b>the</b> first <b>longitudinal</b> wave mode and dispersion compensation techniques, <b>the</b> first <b>longitudinal</b> guided wave mode no longer need to be neglected. Furthermore, <b>the</b> first <b>longitudinal</b> guided wave mode has higher number of non-axisymmetric modes compared to other axisymmetric modes in the operating frequency. This will enhance the flaw sizing capability which makes <b>the</b> first <b>longitudinal</b> guided wave mode a viable prospect for UGW inspection of cylindrical structures. This study has been performed to investigate the potential of exciting <b>the</b> first <b>longitudinal</b> guided wave mode in isolation. Numerical investigations have been conducted to investigate the pure excitation of <b>the</b> first <b>longitudinal</b> guided wave mode. It has been shown that <b>the</b> first <b>longitudinal</b> guided wave mode can be used in UGW inspection effectively in isolation by adopting transducers with out of plane vibration for excitation. This can reduces the cost and weight of UGW inspection tooling. Numerical results are empirically validated...|$|R

5|$|As {{is typical}} for such small animals, {{there are no}} {{respiratory}} or circulatory organs. The nervous system is relatively simple. The brain consists of two ganglia, one {{on either side of}} the pharynx, connected by a commissure. From these lead a pair of nerve cords which run along either side of the body beside <b>the</b> <b>longitudinal</b> muscle bands. The primary sensory organs are the bristles and ciliated tufts of the body surface which function as mechanoreceptors. There are also ciliated pits on the head, simple ciliary photoreceptors and fleshy appendages which act as chemoreceptors.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean {{in the direction of}} that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around <b>the</b> <b>longitudinal</b> (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E

5|$|Since the anemone lacks a rigid skeleton, the {{contractile}} cells pull {{against the}} fluid in the gastrovascular cavity, forming a hydrostatic skeleton. The anemone stabilizes itself by flattening its pharynx which {{acts as a}} valve, keeping the gastrovascular cavity at a constant volume and making it rigid. When <b>the</b> <b>longitudinal</b> muscles relax, the pharynx opens and the cilia lining the siphonoglyphs beat, wafting water inwards and refilling the gastrovascular cavity. In general, the sea anemone inflates its body to extend its tentacles and feed, and deflates it when resting or disturbed. The inflated body {{is also used to}} anchor the animal inside a crevice, burrow or tube.|$|E
5|$|The blind snake Ramphotyphlops nigrescens follow trails laid by meat ants {{to locate}} them, and the snakes are also known {{to feed on}} the brood. Various species of spiders prefer to prey on meat ants, mainly {{attracted}} by the alarm pheromone the ants release. One spider, in particular, the cursorial spider Habronestes bradleyi, is a specialist predator against these ants and uses their alarm pheromones that are released during territorial disputes to locate them. These alarm signals are created by oscillating the body along <b>the</b> <b>longitudinal</b> axis, which are mostly released when an ant encounters a nest mate.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} carotid arteries are {{branches of}} the common carotid arteries. They enter the cranium through the carotid canal, travel through the cavernous sinus and enter the subarachnoid space. They then enter the circle of Willis, with two branches, the anterior cerebral arteries emerging. These branches travel forward and then upward along <b>the</b> <b>longitudinal</b> fissure, and supply the front and midline parts of the brain. One or more small anterior communicating arteries join the two anterior cerebral arteries shortly after they emerge as branches. The internal carotid arteries continue forward as the middle cerebral arteries. They travel sideways along the sphenoid bone of the eye socket, then upwards through the insula cortex, where final branches arise. The middle cerebral arteries send branches along their length.|$|E

25|$|On {{the basis}} of the Renormalization Group Theory of the instanton vacuum one can form a general flow diagram where the topological sectors are {{represented}} by attractive fixed points.
