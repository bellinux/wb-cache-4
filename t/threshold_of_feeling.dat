The new studio, Control Room A, was designed by Martin Pilchner of renowned facility designers Pilchner-Schoustal International [...] and includes four Genelec 1034B monitors, a Genelec 1034BC in the center-speaker position and a Genelec 7073A sub installed beneath the 56-input SSL6000 console in Cherry Beach's newly designed control room. Carman Guerrieri, owner of Cherry Beach states that the studio's new 5.1 array: [...] "is capable of producing the fullrange of musical audio to the <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> at both the frequency extreme—19 Hz at the bottom end—and at the amplitude extreme—over 125 dB SPL per unit.

5000|$|Other {{measures}} {{can also be}} obtained from the cold pressor such as pain threshold and pain tolerance. [...] This is done by requiring a participant to place their hand in the cold pressor {{for as long as they}} can. Once pain is present, they let the researcher know. Once the pain is unbearable, the participant removes his/her hand. This provides a measure <b>of</b> <b>threshold</b> (first <b>feeling</b> pain) and tolerance (total time minus threshold). This method is the most frequently used application of the cold pressor task. Comparable in terms of pain elicitation is the hot water immersion test, the equivalent to the cold pressor using hot water. The hot water immersion test (HIT) is equally capable of triggering a pain response without the confounding of baroreflex activation.|$|R
40|$|This article {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the production of lesbian space in the TV series The L Word (TLW) (Showtime 2004 – 2009). To do so, it departs from theories of the lesbian gaze to discuss the visibility <b>of</b> <b>feeling.</b> Specifically, I consider how TLW represents the visibility <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> as constitutive <b>of</b> lesbian bodies, communities and spaces. In TLW, real spaces (actual locations) fold into virtual ones (on screen) in a deliberate construction of televisual lesbian space. TLW implicitly reflects and is embedded within real-life configurations of lesbian space. I identify four excerpts from the series – ‘gay LA’, ‘the pool’, ‘Olivia cruise’ and ‘High Art’ – that problematise lesbian visibility by foregrounding the relationship between feeling and place. Permission to feel, represented as permission to look, reproduces community as the <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> lesbian identity. Critical to understanding this production of lesbian space {{is the way in}} which TLW associates feeling with social relationships as vividly depicted by ‘the chart’, a representational motif that maps lesbian sexual relations and the intelligibility <b>of</b> lesbian <b>feeling.</b> Finally, I develop my account of lesbian visibility through the example of the facial expression <b>of</b> <b>feeling,</b> at once a demonstration of the visible embodiment <b>of</b> lesbian <b>feeling,</b> and the intelligibility of lesbian space...|$|R

Research method is cross-sectional survey and research population includes citizens of Yasouj who are upper 18 years old. 482 cases were selected using random multi-stage sampling method. Measurement tool was a researcher-made questionnaire whose construct validity was established through factor analysis and its reliability was measured using cronbach alpha coefficient.

The present study aimed to explore the experience <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> fat for women with an AN diagnosis. It was hoped that this would provide an insight into the experience <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> fat and the ways it could be addressed within therapeutic interventions for AN. Methodology: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven women with an AN diagnosis. All participants were receiving therapy {{at the time of their}} interview. The verbatim transcripts from these interviews were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) in order to explore the lived experience <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> fat for women with an AN diagnosis.

These superordinate themes and corresponding subordinate themes are discussed. Implications: Feeling fat was found to be a significant experience for the adult women who participated within this study.

40|$|Victimization and adolescents’ <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> {{insecurity}} {{in public}} transport. An exploratory {{study of the}} role of routine activities and lifestyles. Victimisation and fear of crime have increasingly gained attention in criminological inquiries and in policy. More recently studies pay attention to <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> unsafety with regard to public transport. However, young adolescents are often less studied. Therefore the present study aims at filling that gap by studying the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> unsafety on public transport of young adolescents andby studying the correlates <b>of</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> unsafety on public transport. Attention is paid to a cognitive, emotional and behavioural dimension, as is done in most studies of fear of crime. The study departs from the integrated routine-activity / lifestyle theory as framework. The results indicate that exposure to offenders on public transport routes has no effect on <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> unsafety, attractiveness of the target has a significant effect on <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> unsafety, while the effects of lifestyles is fully mediated by repeat victimisation on public transport.

Similarly, a number of psychotherapy theorists have suggested that client strength <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> is related to therapeutic change, process and progress. The {{purpose of the present}} research was to: (a) examine the relationship between client change events and client strength <b>of</b> <b>feeling,</b> (b) identify what particular levels of client strength <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> are related to given categories of client change events, and (c) examine the effects that type of therapy may have in the relationship between client change events and client strength <b>of</b> <b>feeling.</b> Judges assessed the occurrence of categories of client change events and the level of client strength <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> in 982 statements in 10 sessions of client-centered, rational-emotive and experiential therapies. The findings indicated that: (a) there is an overall positive significant relationship between client change events and client strength of feeling; (b) given categories of client change events are significantly related to particular levels of client strength of feeling; and (c) type of therapy is a significant variable in the relationship between client change events and client strength <b>of</b> <b>feeling.</b> These findings have implications for psychotherapeutic practice and also for clinical theory, with especial relevance for the role and meaning of level <b>of</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>feeling,</b> in-session client change, and a practitioner relevant matrix of conducting sessions of therapy {{on the basis of the}} research variables.
