The program earned him an Emmy nomination in 2002 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, along with Matt LeBlanc, but the two lost to Ray Romano.

500|$|In {{many of her}} World Grand Championship portraits, Nipper {{painted a}} montage {{depicting}} the horse's life and show career. She first used this technique for a portrait of Pride's Generator. When Nipper asked the horse's owner, Claude Crowley, if she could do a montage, Nipper said, [...] "He said 'I don't know what that is, but why not?'" [...] The style soon caught on and was requested by other horse owners. Nipper herself bred Tennessee Walking Horses, and once bred a mare to <b>The</b> <b>Whole</b> <b>Nine</b> <b>Yards,</b> a World Grand Champion, of whom she had previously painted a portrait. Although the portrait was painted before the horse ever won a title, Nipper depicted him with roses around his head. The horse's owner later said she almost sent the picture back.|$|E

Intertainment's head Barry Baeres told the court that he had only funded Battlefield Earth because it was packaged as a slate that included two more commercially attractive films, the Wesley Snipes vehicle The Art of War and the Bruce Willis comedy <b>The</b> <b>Whole</b> <b>Nine</b> <b>Yards.</b> Baeres testified that [...] "Mr. Samaha said, 'If you want the other two pictures, {{you have to take}} Battlefield Earth — it's called packaging'".
