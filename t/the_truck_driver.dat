5|$|In {{the early}} morning of December 28, police {{informed}} news sources {{that she had been}} walking southbound on Interstate 71 near Union Township when she was struck by a semi-trailer just before 2:30 am near the South Lebanon exit. She died at the scene. It is believed that Alcorn walked three to four miles from her parents' Kings Mill house, before being struck. The highway was closed {{for more than an hour}} after the incident. An investigation was launched by the Ohio State Highway Patrol, while Alcorn's body was transported to the Montgomery County coroner, where an autopsy was scheduled. <b>The</b> <b>truck</b> <b>driver</b> was uninjured in the incident.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer never regained {{consciousness}} and succumbed to his injuries {{at the hospital}} two days later on 15 July 1950. The investigation into the accident concluded that though {{the impact of the}} two vehicles was severe, it seemed unlikely that the collision itself was the cause of his injuries. It was speculated {{that at least one of}} the truck's cargo of 30 empty gas cylinders, which were thrown off by the collision, had struck Schnaufer on the head. Subsequently, <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>driver</b> was charged with manslaughter and breach of traffic regulations before a court at Jauge, Cestas. The hearing began on 29 July 1950 and concluded with his conviction on 16 November 1950. Gasc was found guilty of not yielding the right of way, and his speed was considered too high. It was ruled that as a consequence of not observing the law, he involuntarily caused the death of Schnaufer.|$|E
5|$|One {{accident}} at the Mousetrap, a complex interchange, had national ramifications. On August 1, 1984, a truck carrying six torpedoes for the U.S. Navy overturned. The situation was made worse {{as no one}} answered at the phone number provided with the cargo, and an unknown liquid was leaking {{from one of the}} torpedoes. It took more than three hours before any military personnel arrived on the scene, U.S. Army personnel from a nearby base. The incident left thousands of cars stranded and Denver's transportation network paralyzed for about eight hours. Approximately 50 residents in the area were evacuated. Investigations later revealed that <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>driver</b> did not follow a recommended route provided by state troopers, who specifically warned the driver to avoid the Mousetrap. The Navy promised reforms after being criticized for providing an unstaffed phone number with a hazardous cargo shipment, a violation of federal law, and failing to notify Denver officials about the shipment. The Mousetrap was grandfathered into the Interstate Highway system, with some structures built in 1951. The incident provided momentum to rebuild the interchange with a more modern and safer design. Construction began in several phases in 1987 and the last bridge was dedicated in 2003.|$|E

40|$|Class of 2009 AbstractOBJECTIVES: <b>Truck</b> <b>drivers</b> one of <b>the</b> {{most vital}} {{components}} of a countryâ€™s economy, and {{also one of the}} most medically underserved populations. To date, few studies have explored the healthcare needs of over <b>the</b> road <b>truck</b> <b>drivers.</b> <b>The</b> objective of this study is to determine if a need exists for the creation of a healthcare education program for over <b>the</b> road <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> and if retail pharmacy could be an effective setting for such a program. METHODS: A needs assessment analysis was used to examine available literature concerning the healthcare of over <b>the</b> road <b>truck</b> <b>drivers.</b> A multi-question survey was designed to illicit the feasibility of initiating a healthcare education program to over <b>the</b> road <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> in a retail pharmacy setting. This survey was administered to third year pharmacy interns, and 67 completed surveys were collected. RESULTS: Statistics from the selected literature showed over <b>the</b> road <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> had increased health risks and barriers to receive proper healthcare. Sixty-two percent of the pharmacy interns felt they could help provide healthcare education to over <b>the</b> road <b>truck</b> <b>drivers,</b> but 71...|$|R

25|$|Lack of {{exercise}} is another contributing factor to the obesity epidemic in <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>driver</b> population. Almost 90% of truck drivers exercise only sometimes or never and only 8% exercise regularly. This is largely determined by long work hours and tight deadlines, {{the adoption of}} a sedentary lifestyle and a lack of a place to exercise. Though some fitness resources are available for truckers, most are scarce. Available areas are truck stops, highway rest areas, trucking terminals, warehouses, and the truck cab. However, there are many parking restrictions and safety concerns in trying to incorporate exercise into the daily routine.|$|E

According to the report of the Ingolstadt police, that afternoon a truck broke through the Autobahn median; <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>driver</b> was trying to avoid a collision with a personal vehicle in his own lane and lost control of the truck, crashing through the median barrier and finally coming to a stop blocking all three lanes of traffic in the opposite direction (Munich).

40|$|Bibliography: pages 224 - 231. The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{performance}} appraisal system for <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> in a wine manufacturing organization. One of the objectives of the system developed, was to improve the performance of <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>drivers.</b> <b>The</b> sample involved in this study consisted of 80 <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> and six transport foremen. A preliminary study was done to determine the satisfaction of the drivers with the previous appraisal system. A need for a new performance appraisal system was established and it was therefore decided to develop a new performance appraisal system for <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> in <b>the</b> Transport Department of the organization. A literature review indicated that the most suitable appraisal system for this specific situation was the behavioural observation scale (BOS). A job analysis of <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>driver's</b> job was done, critical incidents were collected and behavioural dimensions were defined. This resulted in the final behavioural observation scale consisting of 37 behavioural items. The reliability of the appraisal instrument determined by Cronbach's coefficient alpha, was. 98. An effort was made to achieve both content and face validity for the BOS. To determine whether the performance of <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> did increase as a result of the new appraisal system, an experimental and control group were defined. Their performance was appraised three times at three-monthly intervals with the BOS. The experimental group received feedback on its performance, which included setting goals to be achieved by the next appraisal. The drivers in the control group were unaware of the fact that their performance was being appraised. To determine whether the performance of the drivers in the experimental group had improved, planned comparisons were done. There was a substantial improvement in performance amongst the experimental group, whilst the control group's performance remained unchanged. It was concluded that the intervention was successful. The use of a behavioural approach to performance linked with adequate feedback made a major contribution to the efficiency of these <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> as well as to their interaction with their supervisors, the transport foremen...|$|R

[...] The investigation found that cloud vapor had formed ice in the pitot tube, causing the airspeed indicator to show an erroneous reading.
