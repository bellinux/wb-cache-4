5|$|In January 1978, Boeing {{announced}} a major extension of its Everett factory—which was then dedicated to manufacturing the 747—to accommodate its new wide-body family. In February 1978, the new jetliner received the 767 model designation, and three variants were planned: a 767-100 with 190 seats, a 767-200 with 210 seats, and a <b>trijet</b> 767MR/LR version with 200 seats intended for intercontinental routes. The 767MR/LR was subsequently renamed 777 for differentiation purposes. The 767 was {{officially launched on}} July 14, 1978, when United Airlines ordered 30 of the 767-200 variant, followed by 50 more 767-200 orders from American Airlines and Delta Air Lines later that year. The 767-100 was ultimately not offered for sale, as its capacity {{was too close to}} the 757's seating, while the 777 <b>trijet</b> was eventually dropped in favor of standardizing around the twinjet configuration.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the Boeing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar {{became the first}} {{generation}} of wide-body passenger airliners to enter service. In 1978, Boeing unveiled three new models: the twin-engine Boeing 757 to replace its 727, the twin-engine 767 to challenge the Airbus A300, and a <b>trijet</b> 777 concept to compete with the DC-10 and L-1011. The mid-size 757 and 767 launched to market success, due in part to 1980s' extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (ETOPS) regulations governing transoceanic twinjet operations. These regulations allowed twin-engine airliners to make ocean crossings at up to three hours' distance from emergency diversionary airports. Under ETOPS rules, airlines began operating the 767 on long-distance overseas routes that did not require the capacity of larger airliners. The <b>trijet</b> 777 was later dropped, following marketing studies that favored the 757 and 767 variants. Boeing was left with a size and range gap in its product line between the 767-300ER and the 747-400.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Boeing studied the {{development}} of a shorter 747 with three engines, to compete with the smaller L-1011 TriStar and DC-10. The 747 <b>trijet</b> would have had more payload, range, and passenger capacity than the L-1011 and DC-10. The center engine would have been fitted in the tail with an S-duct intake similar to the L-1011's. However, engineering studies showed that a total redesign of the 747 wing would be necessary. Maintaining the same 747 handling characteristics would be important to minimize pilot retraining. Boeing decided instead to pursue a shortened four-engine 747, resulting in the 747SP.|$|E

5|$|By 1967 {{reconstruction}} {{began at}} the airport, adding three new concourses with 28 gates and three ticket counters, and in 1968 the city invested $10million in renovation funds. (For a few months during the 1967 renovation Midway had no scheduled airline flights.) The funds partly supported construction of the Stevenson Expressway, and Midway saw the return of major airlines that year, with 1,663,074 passengers on smaller-capacity, shorter range twin-jet and <b>trijet</b> airliners such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-9, BAC One-Eleven, Boeing 727, and Boeing 737 that could use Midway's runways, which the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 could not. In May 1968 there were 22 scheduled departures: six United 727s to MSP, DCA and LGA, 12 Northwest 727s to MSP and CLE, one Delta DC-9 to STL and three Ozark FH227s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{following}} {{the launch of}} the wide-body 747, Boeing began considering further developments of its narrow-body 727 <b>trijet.</b> Designed for short and medium length routes, the three-engined 727 was the best-selling commercial jetliner of the 1960s and a mainstay of the U.S. domestic airline market. Studies focused on improving the 189-seat , the most successful 727 variant. Two approaches were considered: a stretched , and an all-new aircraft code-named 7N7. The former was a cheaper derivative using the 727's existing technology and tail-mounted engine configuration, while the latter was a twin-engine aircraft which made use of new materials and improvements to propulsion technology which had become available in the civil aerospace industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{recession}} of 1969-1970 greatly affected Boeing. For {{the year and}} a half after September 1970 it only sold two 747s in the world, and did not sell any to an American carrier for almost three years. When economic problems in the United States and other countries after the 1973 oil crisis led to reduced passenger traffic, several airlines found they did not have enough passengers to fly the 747 economically, and they replaced them with the smaller and recently introduced McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar <b>trijet</b> wide bodies (and later the 767 and A300/A310 twinjets). Having tried replacing coach seats on its 747s with piano bars in an attempt to attract more customers, American Airlines eventually relegated its 747s to cargo service and in 1983 exchanged them with Pan Am for smaller aircraft; Delta Air Lines also removed its 747s from service after several years. Later, Delta acquired 747s again in 2008 as part of its merger with Northwest Airlines, although it intends to retire them from service by 2018.|$|E
50|$|Often navigational {{radio or}} airband {{transceiver}} antennas {{are placed on}} or inside the vertical tail. In all known <b>trijets</b> (jet aircraft with 3 engines), the vertical stabilizer houses the central engine or engine inlet duct.|$|R
5000|$|The Dassault Falcon 900 is a French-built {{corporate}} {{jet aircraft}} made by Dassault Aviation. Together with its larger sibling, the Falcon 7X, in 2008 {{they were the}} only <b>trijets</b> in production. [...] Both aircraft are notable in featuring an S-duct central engine.|$|R
5000|$|The freight pallets {{were loaded}} {{in the front}} section of the {{aircraft}} by forklift via a large cargo door located {{on the side of}} the fuselage aft of the flight deck while passengers boarded and deplaned via the integral air stairs located at the rear underneath the <b>trijet's</b> engines.|$|R
25|$|A {{design feature}} of the {{aircraft}} {{was the use of}} a straight duct air intake design for the vertical stabilizer (tail) mounted engine, similar in engineering design concept to a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, rather than the s-duct arrangement of most <b>trijet</b> aircraft designs such as the Dassault Falcon 900.|$|E
25|$|In late 1991, McDonnell Douglas {{made a move}} to {{separate}} its civil and military divisions {{in a bid to}} raise the estimated $4 billion development costs needed to develop the MD-12X <b>trijet.</b> Separating the costly military C-17 airlifter development, which had been a drain on the company's resources, from the profit-making production of the MD-80 and MD-11 airliners would make it easier to attract foreign investors for the MD-12X.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, MD-11 was launched, an {{improved}} and upgraded version of DC-10. The MD-11 {{was the most}} advanced <b>trijet</b> aircraft to be developed. It sold 200 units, but was discontinued in 2001 after the merger with Boeing as it competed with the Boeing 777. The final commercial aircraft design {{to be made by}} McDonnell Douglas came in 1988. The MD-90 was a stretched version of the MD-80, equipped with International Aero Engines V2500 turbofans, the largest rear-mounted engines ever on a commercial jet. The MD-95, a modern regional airliner closely resembling the DC-9-30, was the last McDonnell Douglas designed commercial jet produced.|$|E
50|$|In {{an effort}} to simplify its fleet and {{capitalize}} on cross-platform compatibility, not only in pilot training but also maintenance, the airline began to retire its <b>trijets</b> (three-engine planes) in favor of twinjets (two-engine planes). Delta's entire active fleet is now composed of twinjets, except for the 747s. The airline is now the world's largest operator of 767 aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|In 1962 Louis Bergman [...] "Bud" [...] Maytag, Jr. (grandson of Maytag Corporation founder Frederick Louis Maytag I), who had {{previously}} led Frontier Airlines bought a majority share in National Airlines and replaced George T. Baker as CEO. In 1960, the airline modernized its fleet with new Douglas DC-8 jetliners which were then followed by ten new Boeing 727-100 <b>trijets,</b> {{the first of which}} was delivered in 1964.|$|R
50|$|By the 1960s, all large {{civilian}} aircraft were jet powered, relegating {{the piston}} engine to low-cost niche roles such as cargo flights. Pratt & Whitney jet engines were reliably powering the 2-engined DC-9 and Boeing 737 series, and 3-engined Boeing 727. The 60-minute rule was waived in 1964 for 3-engined aircraft, which {{opened the way}} for the development of wide-body, intercontinental <b>trijets,</b> such as the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar and DC-10. By then, only 2-engined jets were restricted by the 60-minute rule.|$|R
500|$|At {{the same}} time, a 200-seat four-engine version, the B11 (which would {{eventually}} become the A340) was also under development. The B11 was originally {{planned to take}} the place of narrow-body Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s then in commercial use, but would later evolve to target the long-range, wide-body <b>trijet</b> replacement market. To differentiate from the SA series, the B9 and B11 were re-designated as the TA9 and TA11, with TA standing for [...] "twin aisle". Development costs were reduced by the two aircraft using the same fuselage and wing, with projected savings of US$500million. [...] Another factor was the split preference of those within Airbus and, more importantly, those of prospective customers; twinjets were favoured in North America, quad-jets desired in Asia, and operators had mixed views in Europe. Airbus ultimately found that most potential customers favoured four engines due to their exemption from existing twinjet range restrictions and their ability to be ferried with one inactive engine. As a result, development plans prioritised the four-engined TA11 ahead of the TA9.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, No.34 Squadron {{was awarded}} the Gloucester Cup for its proficiency. It again became part of No.86 Wing in June 1988, though its tasking {{continued}} {{to be controlled by}} the Governor-General, the Prime Minister, and the Minister for Defence. Commencing in September 1989, the twinjet Mysteres and BAC 1-11s were replaced by five <b>trijet</b> Dassault Falcon 900s leased from Hawker Pacific, the first time the RAAF had leased aircraft from a commercial company. The two HS748s were transferred to the newly formed No.32 Squadron at RAAF Base East Sale, Victoria. Responsibility for servicing the Falcon 900s was shared by No.34 Squadron and Hawker Pacific, the latter performing heavy maintenance. In an unusual operation for the squadron, one of the Falcons was dispatched to Jordan in September 1990 to evacuate thirteen Australian citizens who had been held hostage in Iraq. On 21December 1992, a Falcon900 became the first RAAF aircraft to take part in United Nations peacekeeping efforts in Somalia, when it departed RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, with a team of Australian Army personnel to reconnoitre the theatre of operations. The squadron received a commendation from the Chief of the Defence Force, General Peter Gration, shortly before his retirement in 1993. In January 1998, No.84 Wing was organised as a special transport wing under Air Lift Group (renamed Air Mobility Group in April 2014). The term [...] "special transport" [...] referred to activities not directly related to army support, such as carrying VIPs. Headquartered at Richmond, No.84 Wing took control of Nos.32, 33 and 34Squadrons. A flight by one of No.34 Squadron's Falcons preceded INTERFET operations in East Timor in 1999, carrying senior Australian military and diplomatic staff into Dili on a goodwill mission.|$|E
2500|$|The McDonnell Douglas MD-12 was an {{aircraft}} design study {{undertaken by the}} McDonnell Douglas company in the 1990s for a [...] "superjumbo" [...] aircraft, first conceived as a larger <b>trijet,</b> then stretched to a 4-engine airliner. [...] It was to be similar in size to the Boeing 747, but with greater passenger capacity. However, the MD-12 received no orders and was canceled. McDonnell Douglas then studied larger MD-11 derivatives named MD-XX without proceeding.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{used on the}} Antarctic {{flights were}} Air New Zealand's eight McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 <b>trijets.</b> The aircraft on 28 November was registered ZK-NZP.The 182nd DC-10 to be built, and the fourth DC-10 to be introduced by Air New Zealand, ZK-NZP was {{handed over to the}} airline on 12 December 1974 at McDonnell Douglas's Long Beach plant. It was the first Air New Zealand DC-10 to be fitted with General Electric CF6-50C engines as built, and had logged more than 20,700 flight hours prior to the crash.|$|R
50|$|The 737-800 is a {{stretched}} {{version of the}} 737-700, and replaces the 737-400. It also filled the gap left by the decision to discontinue the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and MD-90 following Boeing's merger with McDonnell Douglas. The −800 was launched by Hapag-Lloyd Flug (now TUIfly) in 1994 and entered service in 1998. The 737-800 seats 162 passengers in a two-class layout, or 189 in one class, and competes with the A320. For many airlines in the U.S., the 737-800 replaced aging Boeing 727-200 <b>trijets.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Dassault Falcon 7X is a large-cabin, 5,950 nmi range {{business}} jet manufactured by Dassault Aviation, {{the largest of}} its Dassault Falcon line. Launched at 2001 Paris Air Show, its first flight was on 5 May 2005 and it entered service on 15 June 2007. The Falcon 8X {{is derived from the}} 7X with a longer range of 6,450 nmi afforded by engine optimizing, aerodynamic refinements and an increase in fuel capacity.

2500|$|Olympus 551: The Olympus 551 'Zephyr' was a derated and {{lightened}} {{version of}} the BOl.6 and rated at [...] thrust.

There were hopes to fit the Olympus 551 to the Avro Type 740 and Bristol Type 200 <b>trijet</b> airliners which did not progress beyond the project stage. Curtiss-Wright also failed to market the engine.|$|E
2500|$|The jets arrived {{during a}} period when most African countries, except SA's neighbours, denied South African {{airlines}} {{the use of their}} airspace, necessitating long detours. In 1967 the Skymasters, Constellations and DC-7Bs were being retired, replaced by the Boeing 727 <b>trijet</b> the following year to complement the Boeing 707. The choice of 727 was based on the geography of the destinations to which it would fly; for example Johannesburg is [...] high and hot, where the 727's wings and other technical capabilities enable it to operate out of such airports.|$|E
2500|$|McDonnell Douglas studied improved, {{stretched}} {{versions of}} the <b>trijet</b> MD-11, named MD-12X with a possible lower-front passenger deck with panoramic windows.

50|$|The new PSA Braniff {{would be}} {{operated}} {{as a separate}} entity and would become known as Pacific Southwest Airlines or PSA. The new entity would use some former Braniff employees and operate a select number of Airways' Boeing 727-200 series <b>trijets.</b> The plan met with resistance from Airways' labor groups but most importantly from the Federal Aviation Administration which was not pleased with the acquisition of Braniff Airways' landing slots at various proposed airports of service. The deal quickly fell through and Airways' began searching for another merger partner.|$|R
2500|$|The Boeing 727 {{would become}} the {{backbone}} of the Braniff fleet and the <b>trijet</b> was the key aircraft in the 1971 Fleet Standardization Plan, which called for three aircraft types: the Boeing 727 primarily operated on domestic services, the Boeing 747 for Hawaii, and the Douglas DC-8 for South America. This Lawrence plan would lower operating costs; when Lawrence took office in May 1965, Braniff operated no less than thirteen different aircraft types. Braniff eventually ordered several variants of the 727 including the [...] "quick change" [...] cargo/passenger Combi aircraft variant, the stretched 727-200, and later the 727-200 Advanced. Lawrence also increased utilization of the fleet.|$|E
2500|$|Dassault {{launched}} the FNX at the 2001 Paris Air Show, {{aiming for a}} 10,500km (5,700nm) range at Mach 0.88 up from the Falcon 900EX 8,300km at Mach 0.84. Its new high-speed wing is 1.86m (6.10ft) wider and with 5° higher wing sweep than the 900 wing, its 20% longer fuselage is keeping the same cabin cross-section but with a new curved windscreen. The <b>trijet</b> have a combined thrust of 18,000lb (80kN) to be provided by Honeywell FX5, a new design, or a Pratt & Whitney Canada PW306 growth version. Based on Honeywell Primus Epic avionics, its EASy cockpit is developed for the Falcon 2000EX and 900EX and controls are fly-by-wire. Scheduled to fly in 2004, first deliveries were planned for mid-2006.|$|E
2500|$|Four {{companies}} prepared {{projects to}} match the BEA outline. Bristol proposed the initially-four-engined Bristol Type 200. Avro proposed the futuristic Avro 740 <b>trijet</b> before shelving it and joining forces with Bristol and [...] Vickers proposed the VC11 four-engined airliner, derived from its in-development VC10. The [...] company considered three possible contenders for the specification; two of these were four-engined developments of the early Comet, the world's first jet-powered airliner: the D.H.119 and the D.H.120, the latter being also intended to be offered to British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). In July 1957, de Havilland made another submission {{in the form of}} the D.H.121; this proposal was furnished with three Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engines and greatly resembled the eventual production aircraft. By August 1957, the D.H.121 proposal had been revised; differences included the adoption of the in-development Rolls-Royce Medway turbofan engine, and an expansion to accommodate a maximum of 98 passengers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} Airbus began {{development}} of the A300B9, a larger derivative of the A300, which would eventually become the A330. The B9 was essentially a lengthened A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful turbofan engines available. It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes. Offering the same range and payload as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 but with 25 per cent more fuel efficiency, the B9 {{was seen as a}} viable replacement for the DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar <b>trijets.</b> It was also considered as a medium-ranged successor to the A300.|$|R
