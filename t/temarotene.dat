40|$|The retinoids {{are highly}} {{lipophilic}} molecules and {{are known to}} be transported in the intestinal lymph after oral administration. Three retinoids, isotretinoin, etretinate and <b>temarotene</b> were used to study the effects of solubility and lipophilicity on lymphatic uptake in the rat after oral administration in each of three oily vehicles, cottonseed oil, Miglyol 812 and linoleic acid. Lipid solubility showed a general increase with increasing log P of the retinoid. The most lipophilic retinoid, <b>temarotene,</b> showed solubilities between 109. 5 mg/ml (linoleic acid) and 170. 6 mg/ml (Miglyol 812), whereas the least lipophilic retinoid, isotretinoin showed much lower solubilities between 5. 1 (cottonseed oil) and 30. 5 mg/ml (linoleic acid). Lymphatic uptake of <b>temarotene</b> was 4000 -times and from etretinate 1000 -times greater than that for isotretinoin after administration in linoleic acid. The lymphatic uptake of <b>temarotene</b> and etretinate from cottonseed oil were 27 - and 26 -times greater than that for isotretinoin and from Miglyol 812, 22 -and 10 -times greater than isotretinoin. These decreases in absorption via the lymphatic route reflect a decrease in log P value from <b>temarotene</b> (log P ≈ 8. 7) to etretinate (log P ≈ 7. 8) to isotretinoin (log P ≈ 6. 8). The rank order of increasing lymphatic uptake from each of the three oils shows an inverse relationship with solubility of the retinoid in each of the oil...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{efficient}} and novel total {{synthesis of the}} two bioactive retinoids <b>temarotene</b> and arotinoid acid (TTNPB) is described. The key steps in this process include the regio and stereoselective hydrotelluration of thioacetylene 9 and Te/Li transmetalation of mixed (Z) - 1, 2 -bis(organylchalcogene) - 1 -alkene (Z) - 3. The subsequent reaction involving the β-phenylthio vinyl lithiated intermediate 10 with dimethyl sulfate gave the (E) -vinyl sulfide 11. The Ni+ 2 cross-coupling of 11 with the corresponding phenylzinc bromide and p-oxazoline phenylzinc bromide 12 afforded the respective <b>temarotene</b> 2 and retinoid-oxazoline substituted 13. Finally, compound 13 was deprotected with HCl to furnish arotinoid acid (TTNPB) 1...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{immunosuppressive}} {{effects of}} both ultraviolet (UV) light and chemical carcinogens is to deplete Langerhans cells (LC) from the epidermis, suggesting that these cells {{play an important}} role in inducing immune responses to developing tumors during the early phases of carcinogenesis. Retinoids such as all-trans-retinoic acid (PA) are natural or synthetic derivatives of vitamin A; RA binds to nuclear receptors in the skin, effecting transcription of a wide range of genes. Topical application of PA prevents the tumor promoter 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) from depleting the density of LC in murine epidermis. In contrast, topical RA did not itself alter the normal LC density. PA also inhibited the development of TPA-induced immunosuppression to a locally applied contact sensitizer. Topical RA also prevented UV light from reducing the density of both LC and Thy-l+dendritic epidermal cells (Thy-l+dEC). However, the RA treatment did not prevent local immunosuppression to the contact sensitizer from developing in response to UV irradiation. The reasons for this are unclear; however, it is possible that PA does not inhibit some other immunosuppressive effect of UV light. <b>Temarotene,</b> a recently developed synthetic retinoid also inhibited UV light from reducing the LC and Thy- 1 +dEC density from murine epidermis. Thus part of the anti-carcinogenic activity of retinoids may be due to their ability to protect LC during the early stages of carcinogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Murine {{epidermis}} {{contains two}} types of bone marrow-derived cells of the immune system, Langerhans' cells (LC), which are dendritic antigen-presenting cells, and Thy- 1 + dendritic cells (Thy- 1 + DEC), which express the gamma/delta T-cell receptor for antigen and hence are probably T cells whose function in the epidermis is unknown. Ultraviolet (UV) light greatly reduces the density of both of these cell types, and hence this {{may be one of}} the mechanisms by which UV light induces immunosuppression. It is important to develop strategies for protecting these cells from the effects of UV light. In this study we show that topical all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and an orally administered retinoid, <b>temarotene,</b> protect both LC and Thy- 1 + DEC from being depleted by UV light. However, neither retinoid inhibited the development of immunosuppression in response to application of a contact sensitizer. We also compared two congenic mouse strains, one albino, the other lightly pigmented and capable of tanning in response to UV light. There was no difference in the ability of UV light to deplete LC or Thy- 1 + DEC in these two strains or of retinoids to inhibit their depletion. These studies demonstrate that retinoids but not melanin are able to inhibit UV light from depleting LC and Thy- 1 + DEC; however, there are other immunosuppressive effects of UV light which are not protected by the retinoids...|$|E
40|$|An {{understanding}} of the criteria governing lymphatic absorption of drugs from the gastrointestinal tract may lead to selective uptake of drugs via this route. Lymphatic absorption may have potential advantages over the portal absorption of drugs; first pass elimination may be avoided as the drug reaches the systemic circulation before it reaches the liver, the absorption of some poorly absorbed drugs may be improved and it may provide a means of targeting anticancer agents directly to the lymphatics. In the present study, the lymphatic uptake {{of a series of}} retinoids was investigated after oral administration. The most important factors which were found to affect lymphatic absorption were, the chemical nature of the compound {{and the nature of the}} oily vehicle in which the retinoid was administered. It was found that the greater the lipophilicity of the retinoid, (as defined by the logarithm of its octanol : water partition coefficient, log. P), the greater was its lymphatic absorption. <b>Temarotene,</b> Ro 15 - 0778, (log. P = 8. 7) exhibited a maximum dose adjusted lymphatic absorption rate of 4100 ng/h compared with the less lipophilic Ro 04 - 3780 (log. P = 6. 8) which showed a maximum rate of only 150 ng/h. The oily vehicle in which the retinoid was orally administered strongly influenced the rate of absorption via the lymphatic route. Ro 04 - 3780 demonstrated a 150 fold difference between the selected oils giving the maximum and the minimum lymphatic absorption rate. The best oils in this role appeared to be those in which the retinoid showed the least solubility. Mesenteric lymph flow rate was also shown to vary depending upon the oil. Basal lymph flow rate in the fasted rat, after dosing with saline, was 1. 6 m 1 /h/kg. Cottonseed oil and soyabean oil promoted an increase in this flow rate to greater than 3. 0 ml/h/kg (p < 0. 01) when orally administered with Ro 04 - 3780. Conversely, linoleic acid suppressed the mean lymph flow rate to 0. 8 ml/h/kg (p < 0. 01) after oral administration with Ro 04 - 3780. Lymph turbidity was evaluated as an indication of chylomicron formation and transport in the lymph. Since the chylomicron is the particle in which dietary fats enter the lymphatic system, it was thought that lipophilic drugs, which are soluble in dietary lipid, may be carried into the lymphatic system via this pathway. The mixed long chain fatty tri-acyl glycerol oils, cotton seed oil, soyabean oil and peanut oil, when orally dosed to rats, produced the most turbid lymph (25 - 48 times greater than the turbidity produced after an oral dose of saline). These type of oil also promoted the highest lymphatic uptake rate for the retinoids. Other oils including, oleic acid, linoleic acid and MTS (a Miglyol S 12 based self-emulsifying oil system), demonstrated much wider ranging extents of lymphatic absorption, but produced lymph with similar but lower turbidity (10 - 12 times greater than the turbidity produced after an oral dose of saline). A self-emulsifying oil system was developed for use in the oral administration of a retinoid. This system (MTS), produced a stable emulsion with a particle size of 500 nm after gentle mixing with an aqueous solvent and contained 80...|$|E
