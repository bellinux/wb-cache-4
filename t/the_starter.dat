5|$|After the 2005–06 season, the Senators {{opted not}} to bring back Hašek, instead {{acquiring}} Martin Gerber to compete with Emery for <b>the</b> <b>starter</b> position. Gerber was <b>the</b> <b>starter</b> {{at the beginning of}} the season, but due to his poor play, Emery replaced him in mid-November. On February 10, 2007, Emery was suspended three games from the NHL for striking Montreal Canadiens forward Maxim Lapierre with his stick on his face after Lapierre crashed into Emery's net.|$|E

5|$|Boudreau started Feller in game one, which Cleveland lost. Lemon was <b>the</b> <b>starter</b> in {{the second}} game. Lemon faced Warren Spahn, and Cleveland won 4–1. Lemon was named <b>the</b> <b>starter</b> for game six in Boston with the Indians leading the series 3–2. He allowed three earned runs on eight hits and Cleveland had the lead when Lemon was {{replaced}} by Bearden. The Braves scored two runs {{in the bottom of}} the eighth inning but the Indians won the game, 4–3, to clinch the franchise's first World Series title since 1920. Lemon was the only pitcher from either club to win two games in the Series. He finished the Series with a 1.65ERA.|$|E
5|$|In {{individual}} Olympic competition, Heath won {{a silver}} medal in the 200-meter freestyle (1:49.10) behind Gross's world record-setting performance (1:47.44). He also placed fourth in the 100-meter freestyle event final (50.41); the outcome was controversial, however, because of a premature starter gun and a quick start by Gaines, the winner. Gaines' coach, Richard Quick, knew of starter Frank Silvestri's propensity to fire <b>the</b> <b>starter</b> gun almost immediately when the swimmers mounted the blocks. Gaines gained about a meter's head start on the competition; video of the event later confirmed that {{one or more of}} the swimmers had not been set when <b>the</b> <b>starter</b> gun fired.|$|E
5|$|In {{the season}} opener against Delaware, Steffy {{suffered}} an injured thumb, and Turner took over in the fourth quarter.

5|$|The Bills {{started the}} season 4–1 and then lost {{four of their}} next five before winning their final 4 games.

5|$|The Eagles lost {{another game}} against the New Orleans Saints, and Vick {{remained}} the starting quarterback for a week 10 {{game against the}} Dallas Cowboys. Vick was injured in that game, which the Eagles lost, {{and was replaced by}} Foles. On December 3, after Vick had already been sidelined for three weeks, Reid officially named Foles <b>the</b> <b>starter</b> {{for the remainder of the}} season. After a Foles injury in week 16, Vick was named <b>the</b> <b>starter</b> for the season finale against the Giants in New York. Vick went 19 of 35 for 197 yards with a touchdown and interception, and also ran five times for 25 yards. The Eagles, however, lost the game 42–7, to end the season with a 1–5 division record and 4–12 overall record.|$|E

5|$|The {{game had}} {{multiple}} versions for players to purchase. A season pass was announced on November 12, 2015. Players who bought {{this version of}} the game could gain early access to operators offered in the DLCs and receive several weapon skins. The game was also released alongside its Collector's Edition, which included the game's season pass, a hat, a compass and bottle opener, a backpack, and a 120-page guide. A Starter Edition was released on PC in June 2016, featuring all the maps, modes and weapons of the standard edition, and included two operators plus enough Rainbow 6 Credits to purchase two more of the player's choice (players could purchase the rest of the operators with Renown or Rainbow 6 Credits). <b>The</b> <b>Starter</b> Edition was cheaper than the main game, and was initially available for a limited time. In February 2017, <b>the</b> <b>Starter</b> Edition became permanently available via Uplay.|$|E

5|$|After {{starting}} safety Sean Foudy {{left the}} Rough Riders {{as a free}} agent, Allen competed with Hency Charles and Ken Walcott in training camp for the starting role. Allen emerged as <b>the</b> <b>starter</b> in July, but he was sidelined a month later with a knee injury. While Allen returned quickly from the injury, he was replaced by Walcott as starter and {{was moved to the}} reserve list for a short time. He was reactivated after Walcott was injured with turf toe, but Remi Trudel was started at safety in place of Allen.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{played as}} <b>the</b> <b>starter</b> at right tackle {{in each of}} the Giants' three minicamps prior to the 2004 preseason, but {{incoming}} head coach Tom Coughlin moved right guard David Diehl to the right tackle position before the first preseason game. Allen was originally designated the primary backup at left and right tackle going into the 2004 season, but he was released after the Giants signed Marques Sullivan off waivers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, coach Henning {{said that}} Tolliver was to be <b>the</b> <b>starter</b> heading into next season, and that the team would not protect Vlasic under Plan B free agency, meaning he could sign with any {{interested}} team. As a result, he began to meet with other teams that were looking for a quarterback, including the Cowboys and Green Bay Packers.|$|E
50|$|The rosters for the All-Star Game {{were chosen}} in two ways. <b>The</b> <b>starters</b> were chosen via a fan ballot. Two guards, two {{forwards}} and one center {{who received the}} highest vote were named <b>the</b> All-Star <b>starters.</b> This {{was also the first}} time that the league offered All-Star ballots in three languages — English, Spanish and Chinese — for fan voting of <b>the</b> <b>starters.</b> <b>The</b> reserves were chosen by votes among the NBA head coaches in their respective conferences. The coaches were not permitted to vote for their own players. The reserves consist of two guards, two forwards, one center and two players regardless of position. If a player is unable to participate due to injury, the commissioner will select a replacement.|$|R

50|$|Many of {{the desert}} duels {{take the form of}} a {{staggered}} race - the team possessing the dagger starts by releasing a sand-timer, and the other team starts when that timer runs out.

If <b>the</b> second <b>starter</b> catches up with and tags <b>the</b> first <b>starter</b> during <b>the</b> race, or if they arrive before the second sand-timer runs out, they'll win; otherwise, <b>the</b> first <b>starter</b> wins.|$|R
5|$|Because of his {{nickname}} and {{connection to the}} foundry, John McGraw named McGinnity <b>the</b> <b>starter</b> for the Giants' March 23, 1904 exhibition game against the Southern Association's Birmingham Iron Men which was scheduled {{to raise funds for}} the Vulcan statue then being cast for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition that summer in St. Louis, Missouri.

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1992, Kosar's {{physical}} decline {{had long}} been apparent to Belichick, which left the coach with a difficult choice. Kosar was Cleveland's most popular athlete, a hometown boy who had forgone big money and a bigger profile to lead a struggling team back to the top. While he recognized {{it would be an}} unpopular decision, Belichick wanted to bench Kosar, and in 1992 the team picked up a potential replacement in Vinny Testaverde from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Belichick named Kosar <b>the</b> <b>starter</b> before the 1993 season, but in the third game against the Raiders, Belichick pulled Kosar after he threw his third interception of the night. Taking over with Los Angeles ahead 13–0, Testaverde led two touchdown drives to win the game. Two weeks later, Belichick named Testaverde <b>the</b> <b>starter.</b> On the verge of tears after a loss to the Dolphins, Kosar said he was disappointed with the decision and felt he had done what he could with what was at his disposal.|$|E
