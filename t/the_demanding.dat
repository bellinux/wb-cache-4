5|$|Of {{the four}} {{official}} mountain stages, three ended with climbs: stage 14 to Alpe di Pampeago, stage 15 to Passo Fedaia, and stage 19 to Presolana. Stage 20 earned its mountain designation {{by way of}} the Passo di Gavia and the Passo del Mortirolo, respectively the highest point reached and the steepest climb of this year's Giro. Two other stages had summit arrivals, stage 7 to Pescocostanzo and <b>the</b> <b>demanding</b> stage 16 climbing time trial to Plan de Corones, the summit of which the Giro had never before visited. It was hoped that the number of time trials, including one on the race's last day, would keep the race hotly contested to the end.|$|E
5|$|The game {{made use}} of cutting edge {{technology}} such as force–feedback joysticks and controllers, 3D sound and Direct3D Hardware Acceleration and was largely well received. Critics noted that the game's graphics {{were some of the}} most technically impressive of the time. Overall, however, critics had mixed response for the graphics, as <b>the</b> <b>demanding</b> graphics resulted in poor draw distance; in particular, the PlayStation version struggled in this aspect. In general, the gameplay was favourably reviewed, with critics praising the solid, enjoyable missions, though there were complaints regarding a poor control system and unfairly high levels of difficulty.|$|E
5|$|With its {{unprecedented}} budget, IRIS {{was able}} to pioneer several firsts for Korean television dramas, particularly with its large scale action sequences. Throughout filming, the actors were often responsible for filming their own stunts and action sequences, including Lee Byung-hun jumping from the 130 meter-tall Tamagawa Dam in Semboku, Akita. To prepare for <b>the</b> <b>demanding</b> physical requirements of the series, {{several members of the}} primary cast, including Kim Tae-hee, underwent special training to lend authenticity to the action. During a break in filming, Lee Byung-hun appeared at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival in support of the production in May. A press conference was also held later in the month with the entire finalized cast of the series.|$|E
50|$|Increases in <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for labour {{will move}} the economy along <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> curve, {{increasing}} wages and employment. <b>The</b> <b>demand</b> for labour {{in an economy}} is derived from <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> {{for goods and services}}. As such, if <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for goods and services in the economy increases, <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for labour will increase, increasing employment and wages.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>demand</b> for inputs is a derived <b>demand.</b> That is, <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> is {{determined}} by or originates from <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for <b>the</b> product the inputs are used to produce.|$|R
5|$|In 1950 North Korea invaded South Korea, {{prompting}} the United States {{to intervene in}} the name of the United Nations. President Harry S. Truman was caught off guard when the invasion struck, but quickly ordered U.S. Forces stationed in Japan into South Korea. Truman also sent U.S. based troops, tanks, fighter and bomber aircraft, and a strong naval force to Korea to support the Republic of Korea. As part of the naval mobilization New Jersey was recalled from the mothball fleet to provide seaborne artillery support for U.N. and South Korean troops. New Jersey was recommissioned at Bayonne on 21 November 1950, Captain David M. Tyree in command, and proceeded to the Caribbean, where she welded her crew into an efficient body which would meet <b>the</b> <b>demanding</b> requirements of the Korean War. She sailed from Norfolk, Virginia 16 April 1951 and arrived from Japan off the east coast of Korea 17 May. Vice Admiral Harold M. Martin, commanding the United States Seventh Fleet, placed his flag in New Jersey for the next six months.|$|E
5|$|Most Indonesians {{lived in}} fear and uncertainty, {{particularly}} {{a significant proportion of}} the population who supported the Dutch or who remained under Dutch control. The popular revolutionary cry 'Freedom or Death' was often interpreted to justify killings under claimed Republican authority. Traders were often in particularly difficult positions. On the one hand, they were pressured by Republicans to boycott all sales to the Dutch; on the other hand, Dutch police could be merciless in their efforts to stamp out smugglers on which the Republican economy depended. In some areas, the term kedaulatan rakyat ('exercising the sovereignty of the people') – which is mentioned in the preamble of the Constitution and used by pemuda to demand pro-active policies from leaders – came to be used not only in <b>the</b> <b>demanding</b> of free goods, but also to justify extortion and robbery. Chinese merchants, in particular, were often forced to keep their goods at artificially low prices under threat of death.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>demanding</b> lecture {{schedule}} {{was too much}} for the ageing Froude. In 1894 he retired to Woodcot in Kingsbridge, Devonshire. He died on 20 October 1894 and is buried in Salcombe Cemetery.|$|E
30|$|Figure  7 c shows <b>the</b> total <b>demand</b> {{utility of}} {{customers}} with DRL =  0 and with DRL =  1.88 %. When the units’ output can meet <b>the</b> original <b>demand</b> of customers, <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> utility of customers is at a maximum. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> utility of customers {{is reduced by}} <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> curtailment of customers participating in DR.|$|R
2500|$|Like with supply curves, economists {{distinguish}} between <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> curve {{of an individual}} and <b>the</b> market <b>demand</b> curve. [...] <b>The</b> market <b>demand</b> curve is obtained by summing <b>the</b> quantities <b>demanded</b> by all consumers at each potential price. [...] Thus, in the graph of <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> curve, individuals' demand curves are added horizontally to obtain <b>the</b> market <b>demand</b> curve.|$|R
40|$|The {{cooperative}} solution concept introduced here, <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> bargaining set, {{contains the}} core and {{is included in the}} Zhou bargaining set, eliminating the “dominated ” coalition structures. <b>The</b> <b>demand</b> vectors belonging to <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> bargaining set are self-stable. In the class of constant-sum homogeneous weighted majority games <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> bargaining set is non-empty and predicts a unique demand vector, namely a proportional distribution within minimal winning coalitions. The noncooperative implementation of <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> bargaining set is obtained for all the games that satisfy the one-stage property...|$|R

25|$|A more traditional, {{but less}} common view of {{classical}} education {{arises from the}} ideology of the Renaissance, advocating an education grounded in the languages and literatures of Greece and Rome. <b>The</b> <b>demanding</b> and lengthy training period required for learning to read Greek and Latin texts in their original form has been crowded out in most American schools in favor of more contemporary subjects.|$|E
50|$|To compute <b>the</b> inverse <b>demand</b> {{function}}, simply {{solve for}} P from <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> function. For example, if <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> function has <b>the</b> form Q = 240 - 2P then <b>the</b> inverse <b>demand</b> function would be P = 120 - 0.5Q.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This thesis {{deals with}} <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for energy drinks.

25|$|Late in 1899, Vincent {{left the}} D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, turning down the {{secondary}} role in The Rose of Persia {{when she was}} passed over to sing the lead, Sultana Zubeydah, which was given to Ellen Beach Yaw. Jay was initially given the small role of Blush-of-Morning. Less than two weeks later, when Yaw was dismissed, Jay was promoted to <b>the</b> <b>demanding</b> lead role and received favourable notices as the Sultana.|$|E
25|$|Minnie first {{appeared}} in Plane Crazy. Minnie is invited to join Mickey in the first flight of his aircraft. She accepts the invitation but not his request for a kiss in mid-flight. Mickey eventually forces Minnie into a kiss but this only results in her parachuting out of the plane.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>demand</b> curve {{facing a}} {{particular}} firm is called <b>the</b> residual <b>demand</b> curve. <b>The</b> residual <b>demand</b> curve is <b>the</b> market <b>demand</b> {{that is not}} met by other firms in the industry at a given price. <b>The</b> residual <b>demand</b> curve is <b>the</b> market <b>demand</b> curve D(p), minus the supply of other organizations, So(p):Dr(p) = D(p) - So(p [...] ) ...|$|R

25|$|Many former {{military}} brats report struggling {{at some point}} in their lives with issues related to perfectionism and learning how to let go in areas of personal performance (perhaps due to <b>the</b> <b>demanding</b> nature of military culture). Paradoxically, a majority of those very same military brats who report having struggled with perfectionism and performance control issues also describe themselves as being successful in their lives, indicating a resilience that also surfaces in overcoming or learning to manage those issues in the long run.|$|E
25|$|While these {{political}} machinations were running their course, the Anzac Mounted Division returned to El Arish {{not far from}} the Mediterranean Sea, where there was easy access to plentiful fresh water and supplies. During this period of much needed rest and recuperation after <b>the</b> <b>demanding</b> desert campaign of the preceding ten months, sea bathing, football and boxing together with interest in the advance of the railway and pipeline were the main occupations of the troops from early January to the last weeks of February 1917.|$|E
25|$|The Spitfire {{was also}} adopted for service on {{aircraft}} carriers of the Royal Navy; {{in this role}} they were renamed Supermarine Seafire. Although {{the first version of}} the Seafire, the Seafire Ib, was a straight adaptation of the Spitfire Vb, successive variants incorporated much needed strengthening of the basic structure of the airframe and equipment changes in order to survive <b>the</b> <b>demanding</b> maritime environment. As a result, the later Seafire variants were usually heavier and, {{in the case of the}} Seafire XV/XVII and F. 47 series, they were very different aircraft to their land-based counterparts.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>demand</b> for HSR {{services}} {{consists of}} <b>the</b> self-generated <b>demand</b> and <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> attracted from other transport modes on the competitive routes such as individual car, conventional railways, and air passenger transport (APT).|$|R

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the musical play Love, Janis was created and {{directed}} by Randal Myler, with input from Janis' younger sister Laura and Big Brother guitarist Sam Andrew, with an aim {{to take it to}} Off Broadway. Opening in the summer of 2001 and scheduled for only a few weeks of performances, the show won acclaim, packed houses, and was held over several times. <b>The</b> <b>demanding</b> role of the singing Janis attracted rock vocalists ranging from relative unknowns to pop stars Laura Branigan and Beth Hart. A national tour followed.|$|E
25|$|The {{availability}} and affordability of new consumer-level technology allowed {{many more people}} to get involved into VJing. The dramatic increase in computer processing power that became available facilitated more compact, yet often more complex setups, sometimes allowing VJs to bypass using a video mixer, using powerful computers running VJ software to control their mixing instead. However, many VJs continue to use video mixers with multiple sources, which allows flexibility {{for a wide range}} of input devices and a level of security against computer crashes or slowdowns in video playback due to overloading the CPU of computers due to <b>the</b> <b>demanding</b> nature of realtime video processing.|$|E
25|$|The {{intended}} {{engine for}} the Type 148 was the Bristol Perseus, but the aircraft {{made its first}} flight on 15 October 1937 with a Mercury IX. It was re-engined with a Perseus XII after a landing accident during comparative trials with the Westland Lysander. Both aircraft met the specification, including <b>the</b> <b>demanding</b> low-speed requirements but the visibility offered by the Lysander's high wing and the security of its fixed undercarriage made it the competition winner. The second prototype, labelled the Type 148B flew in May 1938, powered by a Bristol Taurus II engine and the two machines were used to compare and evaluate the two engine types.|$|E
