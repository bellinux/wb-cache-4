25|$|T-norms are a {{generalization}} {{of the usual}} two-valued logical conjunction, studied by classical logic, for fuzzy logics. Indeed, the classical Boolean conjunction is both commutative and associative. The monotonicity property ensures <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> truth of conjunction does not decrease if the truth values of conjuncts increase. The requirement that 1 be an identity element corresponds to the interpretation of 1 as true (and consequently 0 as false). Continuity, which is often required from fuzzy conjunction as well, expresses the idea that, roughly speaking, very small changes in truth values of conjuncts should not macroscopically affect the truth value of their conjunction.|$|E
25|$|Levels of {{herbivory}} {{may also}} increase as temperature {{and carbon dioxide}} concentrations rise. However, should plants remain associated with their current symbiotic fungi, evidence suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> defense afforded them should not be altered. Although the amount of damage caused by herbivores frequently increases under elevated levels of atmospheric CO2, the proportion of damage remains constant when host plants are infected by their fungal endophytes. The change in Carbon-Nitrogen ratio will also have important consequences for herbivores. As carbohydrate levels increase within plants, relative nitrogen content will fall, having the dual effects of reducing nutritional benefit per unit biomass and also lowering concentrations of nitrogen-based defenses such as alkaloids.|$|E
25|$|Ramsey in {{his article}} disagrees with Keynes's {{approach}} as for him {{there is a difference}} between the notions of probability in physics and in logic. For Ramsey probability is not related to a disembodied body of knowledge but is related to the knowledge that each individual possesses alone. Thus personal beliefs that are formulated by this individual knowledge govern probabilities, leading to the notions of subjective probability and Bayesian probability. Consequently, subjective probabilities can be inferred by observing actions that reflect individuals' personal beliefs. Ramsey argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> probability that an individual attaches to a particular outcome can be measured by finding what odds the individual would accept when betting on that outcome.|$|E

25|$|From around 1967 onwards, the Anglican-Methodist unity scheme {{began to}} run into problems. There was strong {{opposition}} from Anglo-Catholics, and the Voice of Methodism campaigned against it. Following initial alarm that the Scheme would begin in 1965, voting was delayed until 1969. There were many arguments over the ‘Service of Reconciliation’. It was argue that by asserting the historic episcopate {{the doctrine of the}} priesthood of all believers, stated in the 1932 Methodist Deed of Union, was being denied. The debate became acrimonious, reaching a low point with the publication of the book 'Anglican-Methodist Unity: Some Considerations Historical and Liturgical' by Margaret Deanesly and Geoffrey G. Willis. The Voice of Methodism brought a Chancery Court case against the Methodist Connexion. It was claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> opposition expressed in the Methodist District Synods and Circuit Meetings did not represent the true depth of feeling against the Scheme in the pews. Around a tenth of the Church left. At the votes taken in July 1969, the Methodist Conference accepted the Scheme, but insufficient support was given in the Anglican Convocations and, despite several attempts to revive it, the proposals lapsed.|$|E

500|$|Tenebrae {{has come}} to be {{considered}} one of Argento's best films by many fans and critics, with some calling it his last great film. AllMovie refers to the film as [...] "one of Dario Argento's best thrillers". In her 1994 book on the director, Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento, Maitland McDonagh maintains that Tenebrae is [...] "in many respects... the finest film that Argento has ever made." [...] Richard Dyer, writing for the Directory of World Cinema: Italy, describes the film as a [...] "tease", one which is [...] "perhaps the apotheosis of one of the core pleasures of detective fiction: being outwitted, wrong-footed, led up the garden path". Dyer believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> lighting used in the film is unsurpassed. Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine said that Tenebrae [...] "is a riveting defense of auteur theory, ripe with self-reflexive discourse and various moral conflicts. It's both a riveting horror film and an architect's worst nightmare." [...] Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club noted [...] "...Argento makes some points about the intersection of art, reality, and personality, but the director's stunning trademark setpieces, presented here in a fully restored version, provide the real reason to watch." [...] Almar Haflidason, in a review for BBC Online, opined, [...] "Sadistically beautiful and viciously exciting, welcome to true terror with Dario Argento's shockingly relentless Tenebrae." [...] Tim Lucas in Video Watchdog said, [...] "Though it is in some ways as artificial and deliberate as a De Palma thriller, Tenebrae contains more likeable characters, believable relationships, and more emphasis on the erotic than can be found in any other Argento film." [...] Gordon Sullivan of DVD Verdict wrote, [...] "Tenebre is a straight-up giallo in the old-school tradition. It may have been filmed in 1982, but it comes straight out of the '70s tradition. We've got all the usual suspects, including a writer for a main character, lots of killer-cam point of view, some crazily over the top kills, and approximately seventy-two twists before all is revealed...
