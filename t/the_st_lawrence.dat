5|$|Victoria Bridge {{was built}} as a one-track tubular bridge which opened in 1860. It was the first bridge to cross <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> River, and the longest bridge in the world. It was re{{built as a}} two-track truss bridge in 1898. The South Y {{approach}} was rebuilt around the Saint-Lambert locks of <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> Seaway in 1961.|$|E
5|$|English fleet commanders {{contemplated}} {{attacks on}} Plaisance in 1703 and 1711 {{but did not}} make them, the latter by Admiral Walker {{in the aftermath of}} the disaster at the mouth of <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence.</b>|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the summer, Wolfe's focus changed, possibly due to frustration with Montcalm's tactics. Wolfe's troops, along with American Rangers, attacked and destroyed small French settlements along <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence.</b> An estimated 1,400 stone houses and manors were destroyed, and many colonists killed. The effort was likely an attempt to force Montcalm's army out of its fortifications, but was unsuccessful. However, the attacks did reduce the amount of supplies available to the French, especially as the British navy, unable to control <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> entirely, was successfully blockading the ports in France.|$|E

5|$|Most of NY37B west of Massena {{ran through}} a low-lying area along <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> River. In 1958, {{this area was}} {{permanently}} indundated as part of <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> Seaway's construction. As a result, NY37B was rerouted to follow a new roadway along the fringe of Lake St. Lawrence to meet NY37 in Louisville Corner. A connector between NY37 and NY37B in Louisville was designated as NY131 by 1960. The alignments of NY37B and NY131 west of Massena were swapped , placing NY37B on its modern alignment.|$|E
5|$|In 1792, the Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe, {{renamed the}} {{archipelago}} of {{islands in the}} mouth of <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> River for the victorious generals of the Conquest of Canada: Wolfe Island, Amherst Island, Howe Island, Carleton Island, and Gage Island. The last is now known as Simcoe Island.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Society of <b>St</b> Vincent de Paul first {{reached the}} shores of Karachi (British India) in 1869. The first Conference was <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> Patrick's Conference. <b>The</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence’s</b> Conference was <b>the</b> second.|$|R
50|$|The Bodmin Community Hospital and the Bodmin Treatment Centre (run by Ramsay Health Care UK) {{were both}} built within {{the grounds of}} <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence's</b> Hospital after it was closed in 2002. <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence’s</b> Hospital, (demolished in 2014) was a {{psychiatric}} hospital.|$|R
5|$|In the 1950s, {{construction}} {{began on}} <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> Seaway, {{a system of}} canals and locks that would make <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> River suitable for shipping. As part of the seaway's construction, a low-lying area in Ontario and New York between Waddington, New York, and Cornwall, Ontario, would be inundated with water {{in order to create}} a navigable channel through the Long Sault rapids and to allow hydroelectric stations to be established immediately upriver from Massena and Cornwall. Much of NY37B was located within the flood-prone region due to its proximity to the river. On July1, 1958, the intentional flooding was carried out via the destruction of a cofferdam upstream, creating what is now known as Lake St. Lawrence and inundating the majority of NY37B west of Massena.|$|E
5|$|Jacques-Cartier Bridge was {{originally}} named Harbour Bridge/Pont du Havre, and renamed after Jacques Cartier in 1934 (400th anniversary of Cartier's first voyage). The section over <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> Seaway was lifted {{to a new}} height in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery {{then turned}} the army toward Montreal. The march was {{difficult}} {{as there was}} snow, water, and ice {{on the ground and}} a winter storm struck several days after their departure. In an attempt to stop an escape of British troops from Montreal to Quebec, Montgomery sent a detachment to Sorel where the force briefly clashed with British troops. The British troops quickly withdrew to their vessels in <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> River. When Montgomery and the main army reached the outskirts of the city, Montgomery sent a messenger in demanding the surrender of the city or they would suffer bombardment. While negotiations for the city's surrender took place, Carleton fled down <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> River in a small flotilla of ships. The city surrendered on November 13, and Montgomery and his army marched into the city without a shot being fired.|$|E

5|$|The ML fleet {{was joined}} by two new smaller 5,600 grt vessels, the Manchester Port and Manchester Merchant during 1899 and 1900, and further new vessels {{followed}} quickly thereafter. The basic sailing pattern to Canada was St John, New Brunswick, year-round and to Montreal when <b>the</b> <b>St</b> <b>Lawrence</b> River was ice-free.|$|E
5|$|The {{section of}} Honoré-Mercier bridge {{spanning}} over <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> Seaway was rebuilt to seaway {{standards in the}} 1950s. The bridge was twinned by an identical one, on the downriver side, which opened in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in North Bay near Lake Nipissing, {{the source}} of the French River which flows down to Georgian Bay, Highway63 travels east through suburbs.

The portion of Highway63 west of Trout Lake travels between these water systems.|$|E

5|$|By Tuesday, {{the storm}} was rapidly moving across eastern Canada. Without the warm lake waters, it lost power quickly.

5|$|Just outside Ogdensburg, NY812 {{separates}} from NY37 {{to continue}} northward to Canada over the Ogdensburg–Prescott International Bridge, where it becomes Highway16 farther inland. NY37, however, continues {{to follow the}} south bank of <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> River, passing Galop Island State Park {{on its way to}} Waddington, where it intersects the northernmost point on NY345. East of the village, NY37 passes south of the riverside Coles Creek State Park and traverses Coles Creek itself.|$|E

5|$|Lacrosse is a {{traditional}} Indigenous people's game which was first encountered by Europeans when French Jesuit missionaries in <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> Valley witnessed {{the game in the}} 1630s. Lacrosse for centuries was seen as a key element of cultural identity and spiritual healing to Native Americans. It originated as a field game and was adopted first by Canadian, American, and English athletes as a field game, eventually settling on a 10 v 10 format.|$|E
5|$|Several {{sites were}} {{proposed}} {{as the main}} Expo grounds. One location that was considered was Mount Royal Park, {{to the north of}} the downtown core. But it was Drapeau's idea to create new islands in <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> river, and to enlarge the existing Saint Helen's Island. The choice overcame opposition from Montreal's surrounding municipalities, and also prevented land speculation.|$|E
