5|$|September 16–17, 2014: Hurricane Odile's outer rainbands brought <b>thunderstorms</b> {{to parts}} of Southern California, as a {{tropical}} storm. The remnants of Hurricane Odile also caused damage across central and eastern San Diego County on September16, 2014, generating high winds and several uncharacteristically powerful <b>thunderstorms</b> in the region. Wind gusts over 20knots reportedly uprooting trees, felled branches, cut power lines, crushed several cars, and flipped at least one airplane at Montgomery Field Airport. Dry lightning generated by a line of severe <b>thunderstorms</b> {{in one of the}} rainbands set fire to a palm tree in San Diego and storm force wind gusts within those severe <b>thunderstorms</b> left 6000 customers without power.|$|E
5|$|Severe <b>thunderstorms</b> can {{sometimes}} produce hail, very strong straight line winds and tornadoes. Very heavy rainfall from <b>thunderstorms</b> {{can result in}} flash flooding. <b>Thunderstorms</b> occur most often during the summer but can occur {{at any time of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thunderstorms</b> {{can form}} and develop in any {{geographic}} location but most frequently within the mid-latitude, where warm, moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes. <b>Thunderstorms</b> {{are responsible for}} the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena. <b>Thunderstorms,</b> and the phenomena that occur along with them, pose great hazards. Damage that results from <b>thunderstorms</b> is mainly inflicted by downburst winds, large hailstones, and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation. Stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and waterspouts.|$|E

5|$|A {{moderate}} risk {{of severe}} weather was issued for northern Kansas into southern Nebraska and from eastern West Virginia through Virginia, Maryland and Delaware. An ongoing line of <b>thunderstorms</b> moved east across West Virginia as the atmosphere began to destabilize. The <b>thunderstorms</b> {{resulted in a}} threat for isolated tornadoes in eastern sections of West Virginia, Virginia, Delaware and Maryland. In the central Great Plains region, a warm front extended northeast in northeastern Kansas from a surface low in central sections of Kansas. Strong instability occurred {{in the vicinity of}} the area as a result of surface heating. An intensifying low-level jet stream broke the cap in the region and resulted in the development of <b>thunderstorms.</b> During the afternoon, numerous <b>thunderstorms</b> formed across the Mid-Atlantic States. An EF0tornado was produced from one of the <b>thunderstorms</b> that impacted portions of Chesapeake Beach, tearing off sections of roof and siding from 10to 20single family homes. EF1tornadoes were produced in Culpeper, Clarke and Stafford counties in Virginia. Several other EF0 and EF1 tornadoes formed throughout the Great Plains region.|$|E
5|$|A thunderstorm, {{also known}} as an {{electrical}} storm, lightning storm, or thundershower, is a storm characterized {{by the presence of}} lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, known as thunder. <b>Thunderstorms</b> occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or, in contrast, no precipitation at all. <b>Thunderstorms</b> may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe <b>thunderstorms,</b> known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones. While most <b>thunderstorms</b> move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.|$|E
5|$|Atmospheric {{conditions}} remained {{only marginally}} conducive {{for the development}} of <b>thunderstorms</b> on the morning of December30. Throughout the day, moisture was drawn from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the Ozarks region. However, the presence of a capping inversion prevented <b>thunderstorms</b> from developing. During the evening of December30, an area of strong wind shear developed near the Ark-La-Tex and southeastern Oklahoma area well ahead of a nearing cold front, providing a focal point for potential storm development. Late that day, scattered <b>thunderstorms</b> developed over eastern Oklahoma and northern Arkansas, producing significant hail. Over the next few hours and into December31, these storms would intensify as they moved into southwestern Missouri, producing four tornadoes. The first tornado watch issued in association with the severe event was issued at 07:06UTC on December31 as these storms tracked across the Ozarks. After a few hours, these supercell <b>thunderstorms</b> lessened in strength as they neared the Greater St. Louis metropolitan area.|$|E

50|$|A severe <b>thunderstorm</b> warning (SAME code: SVR) is {{an alert}} issued when trained storm {{spotters}} or a Doppler weather radar {{indicate that a}} <b>thunderstorm</b> is producing or will soon produce dangerously large hail or high winds, capable of causing significant damage. In the United States, severe <b>thunderstorm</b> warnings don't account for lightning, a significant hazard in any <b>thunderstorm,</b> or flooding caused by a <b>thunderstorm's</b> extreme rainfall (a flood advisory or Flash Flood Warning is issued in these cases). A similar warning is issued by Environment Canada's Meteorological Service of Canada from their offices in Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal and Dartmouth. Skywarn issues the severe <b>thunderstorm</b> warnings for the United Kingdom. Also, {{just as in the}} United States, lightning doesn't warrant a severe <b>thunderstorm</b> warning.

40|$|Dual-Doppler radar {{data were}} {{analyzed}} for three different times during {{the life cycle of}} a severe <b>thunderstorm.</b> The <b>thunderstorm</b> developed a double vortex inside as a tornado was generated beneath the cloud. The organized kinematic and precipitation internal structure of the <b>thunderstorm</b> support a theoretical double-vortex <b>thunderstorm</b> model that was developed earlier. The horizontal perturbation and relative winds, vertical winds, horizontal divergence and vorticity are compared for the three different times of measurement.

50|$|While {{there is}} a {{gradation}} with respect to <b>thunderstorm</b> severity, there is little quantitative difference between a significant shower generated by a cumulus congestus and a small <b>thunderstorm</b> with a few thunderclaps associated with a small cumulonimbus. For this reason, a glider pilot could exploit the rising air under a <b>thunderstorm</b> without recognising the situation - thinking instead that the rising air was due to a more benign variety of cumulus. However, forecasting <b>thunderstorm</b> severity is an inexact science; in numerous occasions, pilots got trapped by underestimating the severity of a <b>thunderstorm</b> that suddenly strengthened.|$|R

5|$|On November14, the National Weather Service {{issued a}} slight risk of severe weather {{for the early}} hours of November15 for the Carolinas and {{northern}} Gulf coast. Although conditions were not favorable for a large-scale severe weather event, the possibility of small clusters of <b>thunderstorms</b> existed. Strong wind shear was forecast to persist, which would allow small bow-echo line of <b>thunderstorms</b> which could produce damaging winds. The result of a weak disturbance which passed through the area of slight risk lowered the chances of tornadic <b>thunderstorms</b> developing. At 12:25a.m. EST, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a Tornado watch for most of eastern North Carolina. A broken line of <b>thunderstorms</b> had already developed and the risk of tornadoes greatly increased, with the chances of an EF2 or stronger touching down reaching 20%. The first tornado touched down shortly after in South Carolina. Over the following several hours, two supercell <b>thunderstorms</b> spawned seven more tornadoes throughout North Carolina. The final tornado dissipated around 4:36a.m. EST, just 3 hours and 46 minutes after the outbreak started. The tornado watch remained in effect until before being cancelled at 8:00a.m. EST.|$|E
40|$|A 5 -year radar {{climatology}} of summer season (May-Sept.) <b>thunderstorm</b> and intense <b>thunderstorm</b> daysfor New Jersey was developed using manually digitized radar (MDR) data from four local radar sites. Echo intensity levels equal to 3 or more {{were determined to}} be associated with sll/face reports of thunder in the majority of cases (75 percent). Intense <b>thunderstorm</b> days were arbitrarily defined to occur when echo intensity levels reached 5 or 6. A network of 63 grid boxes located in and around New Jersey was used to tabulate <b>thunderstorm</b> and intense <b>thunderstorm</b> days frequencies over a 5 -season period (1978 - 1982). Frequencies and averages of <b>thunderstorm</b> days were plotted by grid box and isoplethed by month and season. <b>Thunderstorm</b> and intense thunder-storm day frequencies by month were generally highest over interior sections of southeastern Pennsylvania and south-western New Jersey. When <b>thunderstorm</b> and intense thun-derstorm days were averaged over 4 seasons the maximum frequencies were found over southwestern and northern New Jersey and southeastern Pennsylvania. Comparisons to con-ventional c 1 imatologies indicated that despite some similar-ities, the radar-based climatology provided much finer res-olution and indicated frequencies over urban areas to be higher than conventional values...|$|R

One of the specific features of countries near the equator is <b>thunderstorm</b> occurrence that often occur in particular during inter monsoon. Damage to buildings due to the <b>thunderstorm</b> is frequently reported in the newspapers of the country. Even {{so there are no}} specific and scientific studies be carried out to identify the most recent <b>thunderstorm</b> right become a threat and can cause disaster. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the strength of <b>thunderstorm</b> and associate it with the damage reported. Software "Geographical Information System" is used to map the strength of <b>thunderstorm</b> recorded {{for a period of time}} July 2013 to June 2014. The study found there is a strong relationship for damages as well as the strength of the <b>thunderstorm</b> which R 2 for the relationship between the two variables are equal to 0. 85.

25|$|The upward motions {{within the}} storm and winds at higher levels in the {{atmosphere}} tend to cause the small ice crystals (and positive charge) in {{the upper part of}} the <b>thunderstorm</b> cloud to spread out horizontally some distance from <b>thunderstorm</b> cloud base. This part of the <b>thunderstorm</b> cloud is called the anvil. While this is the main charging process for the <b>thunderstorm</b> cloud, some of these charges can be redistributed by air movements within the storm (updrafts and downdrafts). In addition, there is a small but important positive charge buildup near the bottom of the <b>thunderstorm</b> cloud due to the precipitation and warmer temperatures.|$|R

40|$|Variation of {{atmospheric}} thermodynamical structure parameters between days of <b>thunderstorm</b> occurrence and non-occurrence is presented {{based on data}} sets obtained during Severe Thunderstorm-Observations and Regional Modeling (STORM) experiments conducted over Kharagpur (22. 3 °N, 87. 2 °E) in pre-monsoon season of 2009 and 2010. Potential instability (stable to neutral) is noticed in the lower layers and enhanced (suppressed) convection in the middle troposphere during <b>thunderstorm</b> (non-thunderstorm) days. Low-level jets are observed during all days of the experimental period but with higher intensity on <b>thunderstorm</b> days. Convective available potential energy (CAPE) builds up until <b>thunderstorm</b> occurrence and becomes dissipated soon after, whereas convective inhibition (CIN) is greatly decreased prior to the event on <b>thunderstorm</b> days. In contrast, higher CAPE and CIN are noticed on non-thunderstorm days. Analysis of thermodynamic indices showed that indices including moisture [humidity index (HI) and dew point temperature at 850 hPa (DPT 850) ] are useful in differentiating <b>thunderstorm</b> from non-thunderstorm days.
