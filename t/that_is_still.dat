5|$|Gerardus Mercator (5 March 1512– 2 December 1594) was a 16th-century German-Flemish cartographer, {{geographer}} and cosmographer. He was {{renowned for}} creating the 1569 world map based on a new projection which represented sailing courses of constant bearing (rhumb lines) as straight lines—an innovation <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> employed in nautical charts.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to epitheliomuscular, nerve and interstitial cells, the inward-facing gastroderm ("stomach skin") contains gland cells that secrete digestive enzymes.

5|$|After {{returning}} to Puerto Rico in 1859, Betances established {{a very successful}} surgery and ophthalmology practice in Mayagüez. Even fierce political enemies such as Spanish pro-monarchy journalist José Pérez Morís regarded Betances as the best surgeon in Puerto Rico at the time. His good reputation in Puerto Rico would survive his stay in the island nation for many years. In 1895, while Betances was living in Paris, the manufacturers of the Emulsión de Scott (a codfish liver oil product <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> sold today, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline in modern times), paid an endorsement fee to Betances to have him appear on advertisements on Spanish language magazines and newspapers all over New York City and the Caribbean, based on his solid reputation as a doctor.|$|E
5|$|An {{individuals}} {{right to}} privacy is one area of digital forensics which is still largely undecided by courts. The US Electronic Communications Privacy Act places limitations {{on the ability of}} law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence. The act makes a distinction between stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as VOIP). The latter, being considered more of a privacy invasion, is harder to obtain a warrant for. The ECPA also affects the ability of companies to investigate the computers and communications of their employees, an aspect <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> under debate as {{to the extent to which}} a company can perform such monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with Intel Kaby Lake and AMD Bristol Ridge, Windows 10 is {{the only}} version of Windows that Microsoft will officially support on newer CPU microarchitectures. Terry Myerson stated that Microsoft {{did not want to}} make further {{investments}} in optimizing older versions of Windows and associated software for newer generations of processors. These policies were criticized by the media, who especially noted that Microsoft was refusing to support newer hardware (particularly Intel's Skylake CPUs, which was also originally targeted by the new policy with a premature end of support that was ultimately retracted) on Windows 8.1, a version of Windows <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> in mainstream support until January 2018.|$|E

5|$|Coke became {{involved}} in the now classic Shelley's Case in 1581, which created a rule in real property <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> used in some common law jurisdictions today; the case also established Coke's reputation as an attorney and case reporter. His next famous case was Chudleigh's Case, a dispute over the interpretation of the Statute of Uses, followed by Slade's Case, a dispute between the Common Pleas and King's Bench over assumpsit now regarded as a classic example of the friction between the two courts and the forward movement of contract law; Coke's argument in Slade's Case formed the first definition of consideration.|$|E
5|$|Discovered in 1834 by Johann Friedrich Engelhardt and {{described}} {{three years later}} by Hermann von Meyer, Plateosaurus was the fifth named dinosaur genus <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> considered valid. Although it had been described before Richard Owen formally named Dinosauria in 1842, it {{was not one of}} the three genera used by Owen to define the group, because at the time, it was poorly known and difficult to identify as a dinosaur. It is now among the dinosaurs best known to science: over 100 skeletons have been found, some of them nearly complete. The abundance of its fossils in Swabia, Germany, has led to the nickname Schwäbischer Lindwurm (Swabian lindworm).|$|E
5|$|Galileo steadfastly {{refused to}} use Marius' names and invented {{as a result}} the {{numbering}} scheme <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> used nowadays, in parallel with proper moon names. The numbers run from Jupiter outward, thus I, II, III and IV for Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto respectively. Galileo used this system in his notebooks but never actually published it. The numbered names (Jupiter x) were used until the mid-20th century when other inner moons were discovered, and Marius' names became widely used.|$|E

5|$|In 1793, cattle {{were brought}} by George Vancouver {{as a tribute}} to King Kamehameha I. By the early 19th century, they had escaped {{confinement}} and roamed the island freely, greatly damaging its ecosystem. In 1809 John Palmer Parker arrived and befriended KamehamehaI, who put him in charge of cattle management on the island. With an additional land grant in 1845, Parker established Parker Ranch on the northern slope of Mauna Kea, a large cattle ranch <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> in operation today. Settlers to the island burned and cut down much of the native forest for the construction of sugarcane plantations and houses.|$|E
5|$|In the 1964 Government led by Harold Wilson, Benn was Postmaster General, {{where he}} oversaw {{the opening of}} the Post Office Tower, then the UK's tallest building, and the creations of the Post Bus service and Girobank. He {{proposed}} issuing stamps without the Sovereign's head, but this met with private opposition from the Queen. Instead, the portrait was reduced to a small profile in silhouette, a format <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> used on commemorative stamps.|$|E
5|$|Lasker made {{contributions}} {{to the development of}} other games. He was a first-class contract bridge player and wrote about bridge and other games, including Go and his own invention, Lasca. His books about games presented a problem <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> considered notable in the mathematical analysis of card games. Lasker was also a research mathematician who was known for his {{contributions to}} commutative algebra, which included proving the primary decomposition of the ideals of polynomial rings. On the other hand, his philosophical works and a drama that he co-wrote received little attention.|$|E

5|$|M34 is an {{open cluster}} that appears at {{magnitude}} 5.5, and is approximately 1,500 light-years from Earth. It contains about 100 stars scattered over a field of view larger {{than that of the}} full moon. M34 can be resolved with good eyesight but is best viewed using a telescope at low magnifications. IC 348 is a somewhat young open cluster <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> contained within the nebula from which its stars formed. It is located about 1,027 light-years from Earth, is about 2 million years old, and contains many stars with circumstellar disks. Many brown dwarfs have been discovered in this cluster due to its age; since brown dwarfs cool as they age, it is easier to find them in younger clusters.|$|E
5|$|Merle Hay Plaza {{opened on}} August 17, 1959. It had 31 stores {{at the time}} of its opening, {{including}} its first anchor (Younkers), as well as a bowling alley <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> in operation today. A second anchor store opened later in 1959, as Sears moved from downtown Des Moines to Merle Hay Plaza. Other early tenants included a Safeway supermarket (whose space later became part of Sears), Kresge, Bishop's Buffet (which closed in 1995), and Walgreens (which was replaced by an Old Navy in 1999). A movie theater and six-story office building were added in 1965.|$|E
5|$|The Monte Ne resort {{was not a}} {{financial}} success, {{due in part to}} Harvey's failure to adequately manage the resort's funds. All ventures associated with Harvey's original Monte Ne concept either were never completed or experienced bankruptcy, and shortly after his death in 1936, the property was sold off in lots. The remainder of the resort and town was almost completely submerged after Beaver Lake was created in 1964. All that remains today are foundations and one severely vandalized structure. The area on the edge of Beaver Lake <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> referred to as Monte Ne is owned and managed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and serves mainly as a boat ramp.|$|E

In 2002, students from Ridge Danyers Sixth Form College built a replica roundhouse <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> standing on the site. Many of the artefacts discovered at Mellor during the excavations are on permanent display at Stockport Museum.

5|$|The {{architecture}} of ancient Egypt includes {{some of the}} most famous structures in the world: the Great Pyramids of Giza and the temples at Thebes. Building projects were organized and funded by the state for religious and commemorative purposes, but also to reinforce the wide-ranging power of the pharaoh. The ancient Egyptians were skilled builders; using only simple but effective tools and sighting instruments, architects could build large stone structures with great accuracy and precision <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> envied today.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecological}} {{conservation of}} seamounts is {{hurt by the}} simple lack of information available. Seamounts are very poorly studied, with only 350 of the estimated 100,000 seamounts in the world having received sampling, and fewer than 100 in depth. Much of this lack of information {{can be attributed to}} a lack of technology, and to the daunting task of reaching these underwater structures; the technology to fully explore them has only been around the last few decades. Before consistent conservation efforts can begin, the seamounts of the world must first be mapped, a task <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> in progress.|$|E
