30|$|Bandwidth-traffic-based {{approaches}} {{are used in}} the second category. One of the most efficient approaches to decrease load on the mesh routers and on the gateways is to reduce the wireless traffic. Although cache-based approaches reduce the traffic by caching just the received video frames, they cannot save limited valuable resources in WMNs efficiently. A dynamic stream merge (DSM) method is introduced by Nichols [50] in order to address this problem. The main idea in DSM is to merge at least two similar streams in an intermediate node. A bandwidth-traffic-based method needs intelligent algorithms in order to efficiently assign bandwidth to data streams. For example, these solutions can be <b>topology</b> <b>dependent</b> when a node needs to receive at least two similar streams in order to merge them as one stream. Exclusive OR (XoR) network coding [51] {{is one of the most}} popular bandwidth-traffic-based approaches. In this method, each intermediate node tries to apply XoR logical operation on the received video packets in order to send one encoded packet instead of many original video packets. Although this method can be effective, it is both <b>topology</b> <b>dependent</b> and needs an intelligent algorithm to encode those video packets which can be decoded in the maximum number of receivers.|$|E

40|$|The N-terminal six-transmembrane domain (TM) {{bundle of}} lactose {{permease}} of Escherichia coli is uniformly inverted when assembled in membranes lacking phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Inversion {{is dependent on}} the net charge of cytoplasmically exposed protein domains containing positive and negative residues, net charge of the membrane surface, and low hydrophobicity of TM VII acting as a molecular hinge between the two halves of lactose permease (Bogdanov, M., Xie, J., Heacock, P., and Dowhan, W. (2008) J. Cell Biol. 182, 925 – 935). Net neutral lipids suppress the membrane translocation potential of negatively charged amino acids, thus increasing the cytoplasmic retention potential of positively charged amino acids. Herein, TM organization of sucrose permease (CscB) and phenylalanine permease (PheP) as a function of membrane lipid composition was investigated to extend these principles to other proteins. For CscB, topological dependence on PE only becomes evident after {{a significant increase in the}} net negative charge of the cytoplasmic surface of the N-terminal TM bundle. High negative charge is required to overcome the thermodynamic block to inversion due to the high hydrophobicity of TM VII. Increasing the positive charge of the cytoplasmic surface of the N-terminal TM hairpin of PheP, which is misoriented in PE-lacking cells, favors native orientation in the absence of PE. PheP and CscB also display co-existing dual <b>topologies</b> <b>dependent</b> on changes in the charge balance between protein domains and the membrane lipids. Therefore, the topology of both permeases is dependent on PE. However, CscB topology is governed by thermodynamic balance between opposing lipid-dependent electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{some general}} properties of energy deposition in hypersonics. Extending the flight envelope of passenger aircraft to high Mach numbers comes with problems unsolved before in civil flight, such as sonic boom, or excessive thermal and mechanical loads. Energy deposition {{is regarded as}} a possible remedy to a multitude of problems occurring in this flight regime and thus studied here. A new energy source term has been implemented into the DLR TAU CFD code which models a physical distributed heat addition. In a first step, energy deposition in free flow is investigated using this new term. Four flow <b>topologies,</b> <b>dependent</b> on the deposition energy, have been identified, ranging from negligible induced cross flow component, to a massive detached bow shock ahead of the deposition region. In a second step, ramp flow, as a precursor to flow about an airfoil, is studied under the influence of an upstream energy deposition region. An undesired low pressure region could be explained with a simplified model of wave refraction at thermally stratified ramp flow. Key of this model is a flow deflection above the ramp which is needed to balance pressure differences. This model is discussed in detail to fully understand the physical nature of the flow structure. It predicts a way of increasing surface pressure compared to regular ramp flow at reduced total pressure loss. It furthermore predicts the occurrence of premature shock separation and oscillating shock patterns. Analyzing this model, a simple yet accurate functional formula is found for the additional deflection angle due to refraction which simplifies the calculation of the surface pressure distribution as no pressure balance iteration is needed anymore. These studies are currently carried out within the European ATLLAS project which is concerned with the development of hypersonic passenger aircraft. Computations are performed using the DLR TAU code, a finite volume, second order accuracy, compressible flow solver...|$|R

This thesis discusses the design of transimpedance amplifiers that are used in the preamplifier stage of optical receivers. The three specific requirements that are addressed here are a wide dynamic range, ambient light rejection, and low-voltage operation. To achieve a wide dynamic range, we present a fully-differential, variable-gain CMOS transimpedance amplifier. The proposed topology is simpler than previous designs and has improved stability. The implemented design consumes 8 mW at 3 V, and provides 70 MHz bandwidth with a dynamic range of 77 dB, a maximum transimpedance gain of 19 kΩ, and a gain range of 32 dB. To reject ambient light, we place an active feedback loop around the transimpedance amplifier.
