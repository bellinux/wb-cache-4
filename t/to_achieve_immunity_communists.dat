40|$|Recently, {{the use of}} {{ultrasound}} (US) {{has been}} shown to have potential in cancer immunotherapy. High intensity focused US destruction of tumors may lead to immunity forming in situ in the body by immune cells being exposed to the tumor debris and immune stimulatory substances that are present in the tumor remains. Another way of achieving anti-cancer immune responses is by using US in combination with microbubbles and nanobubbles to deliver genes and antigens into cells. US leads to bubble destruction and the forces released to direct delivery of the substances into the cytoplasm of the cells thus circumventing the natural barriers. In this way tumor antigens and antigen-encoding genes can be delivered to immune cells and immune response stimulating genes can be delivered to cancer cells thus enhancing immune responses. Combination of bubbles with cell-targeting ligands and US provides an even more sophisticated delivery system whereby the therapy is not only site specific but also cell specific.

40|$|Abstract Background Immune {{responses}} to malaria blood stage infection are in general defective, {{with the need}} for long-term exposure to the parasite <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>immunity,</b> and with the development of immunopathology states such as cerebral malaria in many cases. One of the potential reasons for the difficulty in developing protective immunity is the poor development of memory responses. In this paper, the potential association of cellular reactivity in lymphoid organs (spleen, lymph nodes and Peyer's patches) with immunity and pathology was evaluated during Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection in CBA mice. Methods CBA mice were infected with 1 × 10 6 P. berghei ANKA-parasitized erythrocytes and killed on days 3, 6 – 8 and 10 of infection. The spleen, lymph nodes and Peyer's patches were collected, fixed in Carson's formalin, cut in 5 μm sections, mounted in glass slides, stained with Lennert's Giemsa and haematoxylin-eosin and analysed with bright-field microscopy. Results Early (day 3) strong activation of T cells in secondary lymphoid organs was observed and, on days 6 – 8 of infection, there was overwhelming activation of B cells, with loss of conventional germinal center architecture, intense centroblast activation, proliferation and apoptosis but little differentiation to centrocytes. In the spleen, the marginal zone disappeared and the limits between the disorganized germinal center and the red pulp were blurred. Intense plasmacytogenesis was observed in the T cell zone. Conclusion The observed alterations, especially the germinal center architecture disturbance (GCAD) with poor centrocyte differentiation, suggest that B cell responses during P. berghei ANKA infection in mice are defective, with potential impact on B cell memory responses. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Dendritic cells (DCs) {{have been}} {{extensively}} utilised in cancer immunotherapy {{due to their}} central role in immunity. Despite evident CTL reactivity, vaccination with peptide-pulsed DCs rarely achieved clinical benefits. Apoptotic tumour cells (TCs) are promising candidates for DC loading, however the induction of apoptosis in an immunogenic context is a pre-requisite <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>immunity</b> rather than tolerance. The {{aim of this study}} is to induce an immunogenic cell death in TCs using the synthetic analogue of dsRNA, poly(I:C), to facilitate presentation of antigenic peptides by DCs thereby inducing Th 1 cell and CTL differentiation. Methods: A variety of TC lines were tested for their sensitivity to apoptosis in response to poly(I:C), and IFN-γ was used to sensitise for dsRNA induced cell death. The ability of human monocyte-derived DCs to endocytose such tumour preparations was assessed by flow cytometry. DC maturation and activation was measured by cytokine detection and cell surface phenotyping. The ability of DCs to drive a Thl biased response was determined by cytokine assays and intracellular cytokine staining. The expansion of antigen specific CTLs was investigated by pre-loading of DCs with the well characterised influenza peptide, M 1. Results: Results show that poly(I:C) pulsing can result in apoptosis of some tumour lines which is augmented by IFN-γ (IFN-γ/poly(I:C) pulsing), while ensuring cytosolic delivery of poly(I:C) by a transfection reagent (IFN-γ/poly(I:C) transfection) renders causes apoptosis in all tumour lines. Endocytosis of IFN-γ/poly(I:C) TCs can mature and activate DCs to induce the development of a Th 1 biased response regardless of whether TC apoptosis is induced by pulsing or transfection with poly(I:C). Conclusion: Taken together, the data suggest that poly(I:C) induced tumour cell death may provide DCs with appropriate 'danger signals' which in turn can drive the development of a Thl biased response required for the development of anti-tumour immunity.

Interestingly, the initial level of Nab after prime does not necessarily predict the magnitude of the secondary response after the boost.
