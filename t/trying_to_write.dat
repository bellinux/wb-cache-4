5|$|The {{writers of}} Saturday Night Live clashed with Henson's {{vision for the}} program. Michael O'Donoghue, Alan Zweibel, and Al Franken often tried to avoid writing the weekly sketches. Henson felt they were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> for {{situational}} comedy rather than staying within his intended story. Frank Oz eventually agreed the partnership between Henson's team and the show's writers was imperfect, and was thankful they moved on to The Muppet Show.|$|E
5|$|Gilroy {{spent several}} years <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a plot that would fit the setting, and experimented with conspiracies and murder mysteries as central story elements. Eventually, he decided to instead start by {{designing}} the characters, and attempted to create a standard literary hero character. Unable to create an interesting hero, he then envisioned an antihero as the lead character. Gilroy felt antiheros were a rarity in films, because they are difficult to write, and usually devolve into psychopaths; {{in an attempt to}} break from the stereotype, he thought of writing an antihero success story. Several films, including The King of Comedy (1983), To Die For (1995), and The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), were used as research on how to write antiheroes.|$|E

In the Rex, or green, reality, Michael has noticed that Rex has focused a lot on tennis lately, as it was his mother's sport. Rex's tennis coach Tara (Michaela McManus) has been talking with Rex lately about his feelings. In the Hannah, or red, reality, Hannah is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the late Rex out of their lives, wanting to move and try for another child.|$|E

5|$|Before {{creating}} True Detective, Nic Pizzolatto {{had taught}} at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, DePauw University, and the University of Chicago. Inspired by HBO's series The Wire, The Sopranos, and Deadwood, he began working on a short story collection that he later published as Between Here and the Yellow Sea in 2006. He published a novel, Galveston, in 2010, and began <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> for television. His earlier attempts at television writing were unsuccessful {{because of a lack}} of money. Pizzolatto's first major gig in television writing came in 2011, as a screenwriter for AMC's series The Killing. He credits the show with giving him a glimpse of the inner workings of the television industry. Pizzolatto grew increasingly dissatisfied with the series' creative direction, and left two weeks into staff writing sessions for its second season.|$|E

25|$|Allen {{realized}} during {{college that}} he wanted to play music professionally and began <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> music. He played his first gig at a local bar in downtown Conway during his sophomore year, and he went on to drop out of college {{in the middle of his}} junior year to follow his dream of becoming a professional musician. He worked as a shoe salesman at a sporting goods store during the day to make ends meet and continued playing gigs in Little Rock and Fayetteville at night. In 2007, Allen wrote and self-produced an album entitled Brand New Shoes with college friends and bandmates Michael Holmes (drums) and Chase Erwin (bass). The album's title makes reference to Allen's days as a shoe salesman, and only 600 copies of the album were produced, most of which were given to family and friends.|$|E

Barjatya used musical numbers to avoid treating some situations in a cliché manner, which resulted in so many songs that there were complaints during initial screenings of the film concerning its length and number of songs. Barjayta's grandfather, company founder Tarachand Barjatya, loved the song [...] "Dhiktana" [...] so much that the film was nearly given that title.|$|E
