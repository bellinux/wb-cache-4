5|$|After {{affecting}} the Turks and Caicos Islands, <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> {{passed through the}} Bahamas. The eye crossed over Nassau, where a barometric pressure of 938mbar (27.70inHg) was reported. Based on this observation, <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> is estimated to have had sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h). <b>The</b> <b>hurricane</b> struck without warning in the Bahamas, either washing ashore or sinking every ship but one in Nassau. In addition, strong winds downed trees and destroyed roofs. Every building in Nassau was damaged or destroyed. After moving through the islands, <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> curved northeastward, affecting dozens of other ships and wrecking four. On October4, it passed north of Bermuda, where it produced Force11 winds on the Beaufort scale. <b>The</b> <b>hurricane</b> was last observed on October5 to the southeast of Atlantic Canada. Along its path through the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and the western Atlantic, <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> killed at least 383people, making it among the 100 deadliest Atlantic hurricanes as of 1997.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> {{weakened}} to {{a tropical}} storm again on October 14 as it moved overland, and began to curve north-northwest, restrengthening to a major hurricane by October 17 while it was west-southwest of Cuba. <b>The</b> <b>hurricane</b> made landfall over Cuba {{on the evening of}} October 17. <b>The</b> <b>hurricane</b> passed over southern Florida near Pigeon Key and Downtown Miami on October 18. <b>The</b> <b>hurricane</b> continued traveling north-northwest; however, it was forced to re-curve south-southwest, {{as a result of a}} high-pressure area. <b>The</b> <b>hurricane</b> weakened to {{a tropical storm}} overland, eventually becoming a tropical depression. The system meandered into the Gulf of Mexico, making a final landfall in Central America on October 23.|$|E
5|$|Power crews {{restored}} 75% of {{the power}} outages in the Eastern Shore of Maryland by two days after <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> struck, and by one week after <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> the power was restored completely to the Eastern Shore.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>hurricane</b> moved westward {{due to a}} high {{pressure}} ridge while undergoing two eyewall replacement cycles: the first was around peak intensity and was completed when <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> moved over cooler waters, and the second was a brief cycle shortly after <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> began to weaken. The last advisory was issued while <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> was west of Mexico, {{but it was not}} until the remnants were west of Los Angeles, California that they finally dissipated.

In Ocean City, Maryland, <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> was considered the worst in 40years. <b>The</b> <b>hurricane</b> produced 80mph (130km/h) winds and rough waves along the Delaware Capes, indicating hurricane-force winds affected the state.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{was first}} observed near Cape Verde on September16. On September21, <b>the</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Hunters observed a circulation, which indicated a tropical depression had formed {{east of the}} northern Leeward Islands. It moved to the west-northwest, becoming Tropical Storm Helene on September23. The next day Helene became a hurricane, aided by an anticyclone aloft. It moved around a large ridge, bringing its center toward the southeastern United States. As <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> approached the Carolinas, <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> rapidly intensified as the eye became visible on radar, and Helene reached peak winds of 150mph (240km/h) {{on the morning of}} September27. An approaching trough turned <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> to the northeast, and Helene came within 10mi (15km) of the coast of North Carolina.

The remnants continued to the northeast, later turning to the southeast and dissipating on October4 just west of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} the Caribbean Sea, <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> maintained a northwest trajectory.

5|$|After {{entering}} the Florida Straits, <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> {{turned to the}} northeast, producing tropical storm winds along the Florida Keys.

It subsequently weakened and became extratropical on October8. The former hurricane lashed the coast of Nova Scotia with high winds and rain, leaving about $1million (1933CAD) in damage.

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> traversed the Central Atlantic, the United States Weather Bureau {{indicated}} that the storm {{would not be a}} threat to continental land masses due to its isolated position.

After recurving in the direction of Bermuda, the British overseas colony was advised to begin prompt precautionary measures against storm surge and strong winds, which were expected from <b>the</b> <b>hurricane.</b> Aircraft from the United States Air Force and Navy stationed in Bermuda were sent to airfields in the United States to avoid <b>the</b> <b>hurricane,</b> while a Navy task force of twelve ships including the escort carrier USS Mindoro (CVE-120) were dispatched from the island.

A few roofs were torn off, and numerous buildings were flooded from over six inches (150 mm) of rainfall. A 450-foot (140-m) crane was even snapped in two at the St. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant. <b>The</b> <b>hurricane</b> spawned over 10 tornadoes while passing over the state, though none caused deaths or injuries. Total damages in Florida amounted to $95 million ($270 million in 2005 USD), of which $30 million occurred in Palm Beach County, mostly from crop damage.

Though most people were rescued from both ships, six people perished on the former while one died on the latter.

5|$|Despite {{not making}} {{landfall}} on the United States, <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> caused widespread damage.

The previous season Beitia had an opportunity to beat <b>the</b> top ranked <b>Hurricanes</b> at <b>the</b> Orange Bowl on a 43-yard attempt, Beitia missed the kick wide left and the Seminoles lost. Beitia would miss this kick as well as it sailed wide right and the Seminoles still trailed, 14-16. <b>The</b> <b>Hurricanes</b> got <b>the</b> ball back and were not able to do anything on their first three downs, and it appeared they would punt on fourth down. However, <b>the</b> <b>Hurricanes</b> faked a punt on a direct snap to D.J. Williams who rushed up the middle for 33 yards.
