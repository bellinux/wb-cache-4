40|$|E-commerce has {{experienced}} exponential growth {{within the last}} few years. The rapid growth of e-commerce has created a need to improve consumer acceptance and the consumer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>intention</b> to engage in e-commerce. Female consumers have yet to embrace e-commerce as readily as male consumers. Differences {{between male and female}} consumer shopping behavior were examined. This study developed and empirically tested a model to predict the consumer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>intention</b> to engage in apparel e-commerce shopping based on the constructs of gender, shopping orientation, online experience, and Website 2 ̆ 7 s interactive features. Male and female U. S. consumers age 18 and older were surveyed to determine their intention to engage in apparel e-commerce shopping. A total of 240 responses were received. After the pre-analysis data screening, a total of 216 responses were available for further analyses. Factor analysis was conducted by using principal component analysis (PCA) with VARIMAX rotation. The PCA resulted in four new factors including consumer shopping preference (CSP), personalization Website features (PWF), shopping environment (SE), and social interaction (SI). The statistical method Ordinal Logistic Regression (OLR) was used to predict whether gender (G 1), CSP, PWF, SE, and SI have a significant influence on the consumer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>intention</b> to engage in apparel e-commerce shopping. Results of the OLR indicated that CSP was the only significant predictor of INT. A second OLR model was developed to determine the interaction effect of G 1, CSP, PWF, SE, and SI used to predict the probability of INT. Results indicated the interactions of G 1 and CSP, CSP and PWF, G 1 and PWF, as well as SE and SI were significant predictors of INT. Two important contributions of this study include 1) an investigation of the key constructs that contribute to the consumer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>intention</b> to engage in apparel e-commerce shopping, and 2) an investigation of the interaction effect between the key constructs used to predict the consumer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>intention</b> to engage in apparel e-commerce shopping.

40|$|As a {{socially}} monogamous species, humans generally have one committed romantic partner at a time, but sometimes engage in infidelity. Previous research has related infidelity to individual difference traits, including global assessments of “mate value” (relative {{value as a}} romantic partner on the “mating market”). We explored {{the extent to which}} one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>intention</b> to commit an infidelity is uniquely predicted by different components of mate value. The results confirm a negative relationship between one 2 ̆ 7 s overall mate value and one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>intention</b> to commit an infidelity, and also identify four distinct mate value components (agreeableness/commitment, surgency, emotional stability, and physical attractiveness) that uniquely predict infidelity intention. Two of these factors, surgency (for women) and agreeableness/commitment (for men), positively predict anticipated infidelity. Additionally, the results indicate that men 2 ̆ 7 s but not women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> infidelity <b>intention</b> is better predicted by the combination of their own and their partner 2 ̆ 7 s mate value.

We propose a generalized framework to address these issues.

40|$|Despite the {{increased}} offering of online communication channels to support web-based retail systems, {{there is limited}} marketing research that investigates how these channels act singly, or in combination with offline channels, to influence an individual 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>intention</b> to purchase online.

40|$|From a {{functional}} point of view, cognition is a {{mechanism by which}} human uses information in their environments in order to actualize adaptive behavior to sustain their existence. The capacity {{of the system is}} limited, so only a subset of environmental information can be processed at a time. Thus, selection of information must occur. This selection mechanism is named selective attention. ^ The first chapter of the thesis reviews studies on selective attention across feature dimensions. Two types of the selection mechanisms are commonly distinguished; controlled processes that are intentionally initiated and monitored, and automatic processes that operate without the actor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>intention.</b> Although automatic processes are thought to be independent of the actor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>intention,</b> the review revealed that automatic processes are conditioned by the actor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>intention.</b> More specifically, selection across feature dimensions is implemented in accordance to what actions are prepared. This action-based selection plays a central role in psychological phenomena such as Stroop interference and stimulus-response (S-R) compatibility. ^ On the other hand, it is believed that controlled processes become automatized only if the operations are extensively practiced for a long period. However, recent studies provide evidence that certain controlled processes can be automatized without extensive training. The second chapter reports a series of experiments that investigated this issue. It is demonstrated that arbitrary S-R mappings can be implemented automatically without one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>intention.</b> Consequently, stimulus features that are irrelevant to performing the current task activate associated responses and facilitate or interfere with responding to the task-relevant features, resulting in the cross-dimensional response congruity effect. The experiments indicated that active maintenance of S-R mappings is not necessary for automatic implementation of task-defined S-R mappings. Instead, retrieval of episodic memory contributes to the automatic implementation of task-defined S-R mappings. ^ Finally, in the third chapter, a modeling framework for selection across feature dimensions is developed, named the multidimensional vector (MDV) model. The framework realizes the idea of action-based selective attention by specifying how response properties determine weights of feature dimensions in processing stimuli. Five experiments tested assumptions underlying the framework. The MDV models provided excellent accounts of the experimental data, validating the MDV framework. ...|$|R
