MethodsA retrospective analysis was performed on <b>the</b> clinical data <b>of</b> 69 patients with biliary ascariasis who received duodenoscopic treatment while preserving <b>the</b> <b>function</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> duodenal sphincter in our department from 2007 to 2013.

5|$|An {{experimental}} fire-control {{director was}} fitted {{in the forward}} spotting top and evaluated in May 1910. This electrically provided data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crew were to follow.

The director was subsequently removed, but Superb had a production model installed by May 1915 and both Temeraire and Bellerophon received theirs by May 1916. The latter's director, however, was not fully installed by the date of the Battle of Jutland {{at the end of the}} month and she fought without it.
