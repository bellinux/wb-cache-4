500|$|No.79 Squadron {{was formed}} on 26April 1943 at Laverton, Victoria. It {{received}} its first Spitfire VCs on 3May, and a fortnight later began moving to Goodenough Island, off New Guinea's east coast. Along with two Kittyhawk units, Nos.76 and 77 Squadrons, No.79 Squadron came under control of No.73 Wing, which {{was part of}} No.9 Operational Group, the RAAF's main mobile formation in the South West Pacific. The Spitfires were to provide top cover for the Kittyhawks in the New Guinea campaign against Japanese forces. Rawlinson picked the squadron code letters UP, and his own aircraft's identifier U, to spell UP-U ("up you") on his Spitfire's fuselage. After a quiet spell at Goodenough, in August the squadron moved to Kiriwina, the closest Allied airfield to the major Japanese base at Rabaul. This promised enemy raids but none occurred during the first weeks of the squadron's deployment, and the pilots saw no combat while patrolling in support of USAAF attacks on Rabaul; Rawlinson commented that it was [...] "a disappointment <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> <b>What</b> a letdown." [...] The Japanese began attacking Kiriwina in early October, and No.79 Squadron claimed its first victory on 31October, when one of the Spitfires shot down a Kawasaki Ki-61 [...] "Tony" [...] fighter north of the airfield.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, [...] "We R Who We R" [...] gained {{widespread}} {{support from the}} gay community. Dan Savage, the original creator of the [...] "It Gets Better" [...] campaign, which Kesha participated in, stated that she and other music artists that wrote songs addressed to the gay community were vital in helping fans {{come to terms with}} their sexualities and identities. [...] "These songs are countering a hateful message that a peer, family member, politician or a bully might be saying, I get frustrated with gay politicos who discount or undermine the importance of pop stars, They’re a huge part of this fight." [...] Singers Josh Erdman and Ben Klute began posting cover versions of various songs on YouTube, later adding a logo to their videos originally titled [...] "Legalize Gay". They later stumbled upon Kesha's song and upon doing so they changed their logo to [...] "Legalize Gay ’Cause We Are Who We Are". The duo changed the logo to represent the song stating, [...] "The lyrics obviously spoke <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> <b>What</b> these artists are doing means the world to the gay community." [...] In October 2011, Kesha teamed up with the Human Rights Campaign and designed a unisex T-shirt embroidered with purple zebra print – intended to represent [...] "spirit" [...] in the LGBT's pride flag. The shirt's design was titled with the writing [...] "We R Who We R" [...] and was made for that year's National Coming Out Day.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to {{release of the}} first videos, ACORN CEO Bertha Lewis said on Fox News on September 20, 2009, [...] "n a way, this was good for us, so what it did was show up <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> weaknesses we have, and we have moved swiftly ... in order to correct that." [...] She said that after viewing the tapes, she had fired all the employees featured and had begun a comprehensive external investigation. As ACORN learned more from its employees of what had taken place, it called the videos [...] "false" [...] and [...] "defamatory". A spokesman accused O'Keefe of dubbing the audio on the videos. On September 23, 2009, ACORN filed suit in a Baltimore court against the filmmakers, citing [...] "extreme emotional distress" [...] of the ACORN workers and violation of two-party consent recording laws. It later allowed the suit to lapse.|$|E

2500|$|Released on September 30, 1985, Soul to Soul {{peaked at}} number 34 and {{remained}} on the Billboard 200 through mid-1986, eventually certified gold. Critic Jimmy Guterman of Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "There's some life left in their blues rock pastiche; it's also possible that they've run out of gas." [...] According to Patoski and Crawford, sales of the album [...] "did not match Couldn't Stand the Weather, suggesting Stevie Ray and Double Trouble were plateauing". Vaughan commented: [...] "As far as what's on there song-wise, I like the album a lot. It meant a lot <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> we went through to get this record.

It is unclear to the Georgians, and <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> <b>what</b> the Russian angle is and whether they are supporting South Ossetians, or actively trying to help control the situation.” He reportedly wrote on August 8 that “As late as 22:30 Georgian Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials were still hopeful that the unilateral cease-fire announced by President Saakashvili will hold. Only when the South Ossetians opened up with artillery on Georgian villages, did the offensive to take Tskhinvali begin.” “All evidence available to the country team supports [...] Saakashvili’s statement that this fight was not Georgia’s original intention,” reads the cable. “Key Georgian officials, who would have had responsibility for an attack on South Ossetia have been on leave, and the Georgians only began mobilizing August 7 once the attack was well underway.” ...|$|E
