40|$|Purpose. This {{research}} is aimed {{to obtain the}} regression dependence of the machinability on the chemical composition of pig iron (C, Cr, Mn and Ni) in cast state. Methodology. The method of active experiment planning was used to build a mathematical model. Cast irons of composition 1. 09 … 3. 91 % С; 11. 43 … 25. 57 % Cr; 0. 6 … 5. 4 % Mn; 0. 19 … 3. 01 % Ni were studied. Cutting tools with plates 10 х 10 mm out of ВК 8 according to State Standard 19051 - 80 were used for turning. Cutting modes: cutting depth – 0. 8 mm, longitudinal feed – 0. 15 mm/rot., spindle’s rotation frequency during turning – 200 … 360 rot. /min. Lubricating and cooling liquids were not applied. Evaluation of iron workability was produced by determining the linear <b>tool</b> flank <b>wear</b> per unit length of the cutting path. Findings. Mathematically probabilistic equation of the regression dependence of the cutting <b>tool’s</b> <b>wear</b> on the C, Cr, Mn and Ni content in the machined cast iron were obtained. It was established that {{with the increase of}} Cr content in the cast iron to 14. 8 % the cutting <b>tool’s</b> <b>wear</b> decreased as a result of formation of carbide eutectic which destroyed the doped ledeburite continuous frame. Further increase of chromium content promoted appearing of chromic carbides with high microhardness which considerably increased the <b>tool’s</b> <b>wear.</b> The conducted research shown that the minimum cutting <b>tool’s</b> <b>wear</b> 0, 18 mkm/m was observed during the machining of cast iron containing: 1. 09 % C, 14. 8 % Cr, 2. 3 % Mn and 1. 2 % Ni; and the maximum wear is 48, 96 mkm/m – when the content was: 3. 91 % C, 11. 43 % Cr, 5. 4 % Mn and 0. 19 % Ni. The <b>tool’s</b> <b>wear</b> reached 47. 61 mkm/m during the treatment of cast iron containing 3. 91 % C, 25. 57 % Cr, 5. 4 % Mn and 0. 19 % Ni. Originality. Mathematically probabilistic model of the dependence of the cutting <b>tool’s</b> <b>wear</b> on the C, Cr, Mn and Ni content in the machined cast iron has been elaborated by the author. Practical value. The model allows optimizing the compositions of wear-resistant cast irons for castings which require the significant mechanical machining.

2500|$|Metal cutting [...] generates heat due to {{friction}} and energy lost deforming the material. The surrounding air has low thermal conductivity (conducts heat poorly) meaning it {{is a poor}} coolant. Ambient air cooling is sometimes adequate for light cuts and low duty cycles typical of maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) or hobbyist work. Production work requires heavy cutting over long time periods and typically produces more heat than air cooling can remove. Rather than pausing production while the tool cools, using liquid coolant removes significantly more heat more rapidly, and can also speed cutting and reduce {{friction and}} <b>tool</b> <b>wear.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{mechanics}} of cutting analysis for orthogonal cutting with <b>tool</b> flank <b>wear</b> is presented {{based on an}} experimental investigation. It shows that <b>tool</b> flank <b>wear</b> does not statistically affect the basic cutting quantities such as the shear angle and shear stress, both qualitatively and quantitatively, but results in an additional rubbing or ploughing force on the wearland. Based on this finding, an orthogonal cutting force model is proposed which makes full use of the classical thin shear zone analysis for "sharp" tools. This model may {{form the basis for}} developing the predictive force models in practical operations. The study also shows that <b>tool</b> flank <b>wear</b> results in a substantial increase in the force components and that the thrust force is more sensitive to <b>tool</b> flank <b>wear.</b> These may be used as a primary basis for developing tool condition monitoring strategies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an emitted sound signal analysis technique for <b>tool</b> flank <b>wear</b> monitoring {{based on the}} Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT). HHT is a new signal processing technique suitable for analyzing non-stationary and non-linear signals like emitted sound. The need for HHT in this analysis and its principle are explained. The entire experiment was done on a conventional turning machine using carbide insert tools and mild steel work piece. The emitted sound signal during turning process of a fresh <b>tool,</b> a slightly <b>worn</b> <b>tool</b> with 0. 2 mm flank wear and a severely <b>worn</b> <b>tool</b> with 0. 4 mm flank wear were recorded separately using a highly sensitive microphone under different cutting conditions. Each emitted sound signal is decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The Hilbert transform is then applied on each IMF to obtain the instantaneous frequencies with time and their amplitudes. Finally, the marginal and the Hilbert spectrums of fresh, slightly worn and severely <b>worn</b> <b>tool</b> sound signals were produced using selected IMFs. From these spectrums, {{it is found that}} the increase in <b>tool</b> flank <b>wear</b> resulted in an increase of the sound pressure amplitude. This is also found true for all the different cutting conditions. The results show that the HHT-based emitted sound signal analysis can also be considered as a simple and reliable method for <b>tool</b> flank <b>wear</b> monitoring...|$|R
