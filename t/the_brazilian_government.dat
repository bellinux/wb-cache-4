5|$|After {{the first}} Brazilian dreadnought, Minas Geraes, was launched, <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government</b> began an {{extended}} campaign {{to remove the}} third dreadnought from the contract because of political—backlash from the Revolt of the Lash coupled with warming relations with Argentina—and economic reasons. After much negotiating and attempts from Armstrong to hold <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government</b> to the contract, the Brazilians relented, {{due in part to}} lower bond rates that made it possible for the government to borrow the necessary money. Rio de Janeiro was laid down {{for the first time in}} March 1910.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government</b> {{refused to}} yield, and Christie issued orders for British {{warships}} to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity. Brazil {{prepared for what}} {{was seen as an}} imminent conflict. PedroII was the main reason for Brazil's resistance; he rejected any suggestion of yielding. This response came as a surprise to Christie, who changed his tenor and proposed a peaceful settlement through international arbitration. <b>The</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government</b> presented its demands and, upon seeing the British government's position weaken, severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863.|$|E
5|$|This {{period of}} calm {{came to an}} end when the British consul in Rio de Janeiro nearly sparked a war between Great Britain and Brazil. He sent an {{ultimatum}} containing abusive demands arising out of two minor incidents at the end of 1861 and beginning of 1862. <b>The</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government</b> refused to yield, and the consul issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity. Brazil prepared itself for the imminent conflict, and coastal defenses were given permission to fire upon any British warship that tried to capture Brazilian merchant ships. <b>The</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government</b> then severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863.|$|E
50|$|During his life, Barbosa was persecuted by <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>governments</b> {{due to his}} {{practice}} of Umbanda. He died at age 78.|$|R
5000|$|Here is {{the result}} of <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government's</b> lack of {{confidence}} in its generals and giving its Armies to foreign generals.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, due to <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government's</b> Campanha do Metal (Metal Campaign), {{the club}} donated all its trophies {{to be used}} for cannon production.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government</b> in {{the late}} 1960s used {{herbicides}} to defoliate a large section of the Amazon rainforest so that Alcoa could build the Tucuruí dam to power mining operations. Large areas of rainforest were destroyed, along with the homes and livelihoods of thousands of rural peasants and indigenous tribes.|$|E
5|$|An {{entirely new}} design {{incorporating}} the latest dreadnought technology was {{drawn up by}} J.R. Perrett, the head of Elswick Ordnance Company, and approved by <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government</b> on 20 February 1907. Argentina and Chile immediately annulled the 1902 treaty that had ended their naval arms race, and both planned to expand their own navies, though Chile was delayed by a financial depression in 1907 and a major earthquake the next year.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the smaller}} {{warships}} faction prevailed. After Law no. 1452 was passed on 30 December 1905, which authorized £4,214,550 for new warship construction (£1,685,820 in 1906), three small battleships, three armored cruisers, six destroyers, twelve torpedo boats, three submarines, a collier, and a training ship were ordered. Though <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government</b> later eliminated the armored cruisers for monetary reasons, the Minister of the Navy, Admiral Júlio César de Noronha, {{signed a contract}} with Armstrong Whitworth for the planned battleships on 23 July 1906.|$|E

50|$|The {{film has}} been {{challenged}} by <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government’s</b> Indian affairs department, FUNAI, which has requested the involvement of Brazil’s federal police in investigating whether <b>the</b> film breaks <b>Brazilian</b> law.|$|R
50|$|In 2015 Mazzucato was {{commissioned}} {{to write a}} report for <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Government’s</b> Ministry for Science, Technology & Innovation on Brazil’s innovation policy which was published on April 6, 2016.|$|R
5|$|In the mid-1990s, Brazilian and Russian {{authorities}} conducted {{talks on}} the possible acquisition of the Su-27M. In 2001, <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government</b> launched the F-X tender, the objective of which was to procure at least twelve aircraft to replace the Brazilian Air Force's ageing aircraft, primarily the Mirage IIIs. Since <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government</b> was also looking to develop the country's aerospace and defence industries, Sukhoi partnered with the Brazilian defence contractor Avibras during the tender. The two companies submitted the Su-27M to the US$700-million tender, and included an offset agreement wherein the Brazilian industry would participate in the manufacturing of certain aircraft equipment. The tender was suspended in 2003 because of domestic political issues and then scrapped in 2005, pending the availability of new fighters. The Su-27M was preferred over the next favourite, the Mirage 2000BR; had the aircraft been purchased, {{it would have been}} the first heavy fighter delivered to Latin America.|$|E
5|$|Minas Geraes was christened by Senhora Regis de Oliveira, {{the wife}} of the Brazilian {{minister}} to Great Britain, and launched at Newcastle-on-Tyne on 10 September 1908. During fitting-out, it was moved to Vickers' Walker Yard, and thousands turned out to see the incomplete ship squeeze barely underneath and through overhead and swing bridges. After completion, Minas Geraes was handed over by Armstrong on 5 January to the Brazilian Commission on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government,</b> while the ship's company was mustered on deck. The British Royal Navy carried out its gunnery trials at the request of Armstrong's and with the agreement of <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government.</b> Although the idea of having superfiring turrets was not new—the American s were also designed and built in this fashion around the same time—the trials attracted interest from a few nations, who sent representatives to observe. They wanted to resolve two major questions: the effect that firing the upper superfiring turrets would have on the crewmen in the lower guns, and whether smoke from the discharge of the lower guns would hinder the targeting capabilities of the upper turret. The tests resolved both questions satisfactorily.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{few months}} after his victory, PedroI died from tuberculosis. Maria Amélia's mother took her to Portugal, where she {{remained}} for most of her life without ever visiting Brazil. <b>The</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government</b> refused to recognize Maria Amélia as a member of Brazil's Imperial House because she was foreign-born, but when her elder half-brother PedroII was declared of age in 1840, he successfully intervened on her behalf.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, Inhotim joined <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government's</b> {{official}} {{botanical garden}} association, {{and the staff}} has begun an inventory of its 4,500 plant species, including 1,300 types of palm alone. There are greenhouses for unusually rare plants.|$|R
5000|$|... 2008: National LGBT Conference was held. The event, {{the first}} in the world to be {{organized}} by a government, is a result of demands made by civil society and <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government's</b> support of LGBT people's rights.|$|R
50|$|In foreign policy, a {{boundary}} dispute with Argentina arbitrated by U.S. President Grover Cleveland was resolved {{in favor of}} Brazil. Historians ascribe that diplomatic success to the efforts and diligence of <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Government's</b> representative, <b>the</b> Baron of Rio Branco, appointed by Morais to lead <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> delegation in <b>the</b> arbitration process.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government</b> {{set about}} {{creating}} a regional alliance against Rosas, sending a delegation to the region led by Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão (later the Marquis of Paraná), who held plenipotentiary authority. He was assisted by José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later the Viscount of Rio Branco). Brazil signed a treaty with Bolívia in which Bolivia agreed to strengthen its border defenses to deter any attack by Rosas, though it declined to contribute troops to a war with Argentina.|$|E
5|$|To Flores, Brazil's {{military}} operations against the Blanco government represented a priceless opportunity, {{since he had}} been unable to achieve any lasting results during the rebellion. He entered talks with Saraiva, winning <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government</b> over, after promising to settle their claims refused by the Blanco government. The Brazilian plenipotentiary minister gave instructions to Tamandaré to form a joint offensive with the Colorado leader and overthrow the Blancos. On 20 October, after a swift exchange of letters, Flores and the Brazilian vice-admiral formed a secret alliance.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{international}} investigations {{took place in}} the early 2000s regarding the use of Credit Suisse accounts for tax evasion. <b>The</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government</b> investigated 13 former and current Credit Suisse employees in 2008. The investigation led to arrests that year and in 2009 {{as part of a larger}} crackdown in Brazil. Four Credit Suisse bankers were accused of fraud by the US Justice Department in 2011 for helping wealthy Americans avoid taxes. German authorities found that citizens were using insurance policies of a Bermuda-based Credit Suisse subsidiary to earn tax-free interest.|$|E
50|$|When Rondon reached Rio de Janeiro, he {{was hailed}} as a hero, because it was {{believed}} that he and the expedition had died in the jungle. After the expedition, he became the first director of <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Government's</b> Indian Protection Agency, or the SPI.|$|R

5|$|After the 1973 oil crisis, <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government</b> made {{mandatory}} the use {{of ethanol}} blends with gasoline, and neat ethanol-powered cars (E100 only) were launched to the market in 1979, after testing with several prototypes developed by four carmakers. Brazilian carmakers modified gasoline engines to support ethanol characteristics and changes included compression ratio, amount of fuel injected, replacement of materials that would get corroded by the contact with ethanol, use of colder spark plugs suitable for dissipating heat due to higher flame temperatures, and an auxiliary cold-start system that injects gasoline from a small tank in the engine compartment to help starting when cold.|$|E
5|$|Agincourt {{was later}} {{transferred}} to the 2nd Battle Squadron and {{was present at the}} surrender of the High Seas Fleet on 21November 1918. She was placed in reserve at Rosyth in March 1919. After unsuccessful attempts to sell her to <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Government,</b> she was listed for disposal in April 1921, but was used for experimental purposes later that year. She was sold for scrap on 19December 1922 to comply with the tonnage limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty, although she was not actually broken up until the end of 1924.|$|E
5|$|Backed by the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (present-day Argentina), a {{small band}} {{declared}} Brazil's southernmost province of Cisplatina to be independent in April 1825. <b>The</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government</b> at first perceived the secession attempt as a minor uprising. It took months before a greater threat posed by {{the involvement of the}} United Provinces, which expected to annex Cisplatina, caused serious concern. In retaliation, the Empire declared war in December, triggering the Cisplatine War. The Emperor traveled to Bahia province (located in northeastern Brazil) in February 1826, taking along his wife and daughter Maria. The Emperor was warmly welcomed by the inhabitants of Bahia. The trip was planned to generate support for the war-effort.|$|E
50|$|In 2002 {{he joined}} <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> Ministry of Finance as the State Secretary for International Affairs, a {{position}} which he held through 2003. In his capacity as Deputy Minister of Finance, Canuto managed multilateral affairs, {{relationships with other}} governments, and institutional relations with foreign investors. He also coordinated the technical contribution of the Ministry of Finance to <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government's</b> foreign trade negotiations.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government's</b> Fundação Nacional do Índio (FUNAI) [...] "declared a 31-square-mile hectare {{area around}} him off-limits to {{trespassing}} and development." [...] His territory was later expanded by 11.5 square miles (3,000 hectares). [...] Brazil's constitution, ratified in 1988, had already granted indigenous people ("Indians") rights to lands they had traditionally inhabited.|$|R

5|$|In 1925, Maeda became {{involved}} with helping settle Japanese immigrants near Tome-açú, a Japanese-owned company town in Pará, Brazil. This {{was part of a}} large tract in the Amazon forest set aside for Japanese settlement by <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government.</b> The crops grown by the Japanese were not popular with the Brazilians, and the Japanese investors eventually gave up on the project. Maeda also continued teaching judo, now mostly to the children of Japanese immigrants. Consequently, in 1929, the Kodokan promoted him to 6th dan, and on November 27, 1941, to 7th dan. Maeda never knew of this final promotion, because he died in Belém on November 28, 1941. The cause of death was kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|In August, a bill {{authorizing the}} Argentine Navy to acquire three dreadnoughts {{was passed by}} the Chamber of Deputies seventy-two to thirteen. Three months later, it was {{defeated}} in the Senate after they approved an arbitration treaty and the government made a last-ditch offer to purchase one of the two Brazilian dreadnoughts currently being constructed. <b>The</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government</b> declined, so the bill was reintroduced and passed by the Senate on 17 December 1908 with forty-nine in support to thirteen opposed, over socialist objections that the country needed to be populated and the large sum of money (£14,000,000) could be better spent {{in other areas of the}} government.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{although}} the Argentine–Chilean agreement had limited their naval expansion, they still retained the numerous vessels {{built in the}} interim, so {{by the turn of}} the 20th century the Brazilian Navy lagged far behind its Argentine and Chilean counterparts in quality and total tonnage. Brazil's huge advantage in population—it had almost three times the population of Argentina, close to five times that of Chile, and nearly double of the two combined—led <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government</b> to believe that it should assume a leading role in naval affairs on the continent.|$|E
50|$|CNNA {{had already}} benefited from <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government's</b> {{decision}} {{to invest in}} a pilot training campaign and hoped that a dedicated trainer aircraft would attract even more sales. To that end, the HL-3 was proposed, and one prototype was constructed and flown. Unfortunately for the firm, this was not to be the case, and no official interest was shown.|$|R
50|$|CBERS-4 was {{initially}} {{scheduled to be}} launched in 2015, however after the loss of CBERS-3 at launch in December 2013, China and Brazil agreed to accelerate the production of CBERS-4 by 1 year. The satellite will restore <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government's</b> ability to observe its own territory following a 4.5-year gap caused {{by the failure of}} CBERS-2B and CBERS-3.|$|R
5000|$|The {{beach is}} one of many areas that suffers from the city's poor waste treatment. In its waters, [...] "fecal {{coliform}} bacteria sometimes spike at 16 times <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> <b>government's</b> 'satisfactory' level." [...] Large amounts of pollutants are still dumped into the sea through the nearby marine outfall pipe, a matter of increasing concern to ecologists.|$|R
