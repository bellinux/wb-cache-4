5|$|The top ten contested {{the third}} part of qualifying. Romain Grosjean was unable to post a lap time after having problem with his {{brake-by-wire}} system. At {{the beginning of the}} session, both Mercedes drivers set two fast laps. After <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> Rosberg was ahead of Hamilton, but the World Champion improved on his second lap, being two-tenths of a second faster than his teammate. During their final flying laps {{at the end of the}} session, both drivers spun on different parts of the track, Hamilton in turn one and Rosberg in the final corner, meaning the order remained, with Hamilton taking the 45th pole position of his career, drawing level with Sebastian Vettel, who qualified third. Last year's pole sitter Felipe Massa followed in fourth, while Le Mans winner Nico Hülkenberg finished fifth, ahead of the second Williams of Valtteri Bottas.|$|E
5|$|When {{animals are}} faced with a choice to either wait for a reward, or receive a reward right away, the {{discounting}} of the reward is hyperbolic. As the length of time of waiting for a reward increases, the reward is discounted at a gradual rate. Empirical data have suggested that exponential discounting, rewards discounting at a constant rate per unit of waiting time, only occurs when there are random interruptions in foraging. Discounting can also be related to the risk sensitivity of animals. Rather than relating risk to delay, risk sensitivity acts as a function of delay discounting. In a study conducted by Haden and Platt, macaque monkeys were given the choice of a medium reward that they knew they would receive, versus a more risky choice. The riskier choice would reward the monkey with a large reward fifty percent of the time, and a small reward the other fifty percent. The ultimate payoff was the same, but the monkeys preferred the riskier choice. They speculated that the monkeys did not see their action as risky, but rather as a large, delayed reward. They reasoned that the monkeys viewed the large reward as certain: if they did not get the large reward <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> they would eventually get it, but at a longer delay.|$|E

In 1633 he was made an alderman of the town, although the position was unconfirmed as the town was awaiting confirmation of its royal charter. During this period of absolute monarchy, known as Thorough, most of the normal political channels for debate and contest were unavailable and both conformity and dissent were vented through ecclesiastical politics.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{aspects of}} {{gameplay}} in Mass Effect 3 are impacted by choices made in previous games. When {{starting a new}} game, players with saved files from Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 are given the option of importing them into Mass Effect 3 to reflect these choices. If a saved file is imported, over 1000 variables are pulled to help shape how the final chapter is experienced. If no saved files are available, there is an origin-story comic (similar to that in Mass Effect 2) to help new players make quick decisions. Imported characters' appearance and class are changeable, with more features and hair-styles included in the character creator than in Mass Effect 2. Commander Shepard always starts the game with some powers. Upon finishing the game, a New Game+ option allows players to continue playing after the main story ends, starting again with their finished Shepard to collect items they missed <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>around.</b> The game has 82 minutes of cut-scenes.|$|E

A horrible episode on so many levels." [...] Zack Handlen watched the episode for The A.V. Club and said that he [...] "expected more from TNG", saying that he was not sure what the reversal of gender roles in the episode was meant to achieve. He described the virus subplot as [...] "absurd" [...] and gave the episode an F grade. The episode was included in a couple of worst episode lists, including in one compiled by Scott Thrill for Wired magazine, and it was ranked the fourth worst episode by Jay Garmon at the website TechRepublic.|$|E

Turlington said of the album: I went to friends first, as I did with the first CD. Bono and Chris Martin were great supporters of the project <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> and when I knew I wanted to include men on this album they were obvious choices. They are also both fathers to daughters. Others, such as Patti Smith and Rita Wilson, I've {{known for a long}} time, and some, like Edie Brickell and Paul Simon, I only met briefly but was a huge admirer. I generally wanted a diverse group of artists who were parents, {{or in the case of}} Edward Sharpe, who will be soon.

500|$|Kallie Plagge at IGN remarked how the remaster wasn't as revolutionary a {{game when}} {{compared}} with the original, and that certain aspects, such as the pacing and level design, felt notably dated. She praised the range of visual and technical improvements compared with other remasters, but criticized some minor shortcomings with regards to both graphical and design elements, saying [...] "there are cracks in the facade; a checkpoint-triggered cloud of smoke {{near the end of the}} campaign was jarringly rough around the edges, for instance, and there were times when I'd get momentarily stuck on the geometry of a door and unceremoniously shoved to the side by a scripted ally charging through." [...] Despite this, she complimented the gameplay as having held up remarkably well and which felt more gratifying as a result of being unaltered, stating how it left her [...] "feeling relatively weighed down, encumbered, and more desperate in the fray. [...] It feels urgent, and it's still really satisfying even next to a contemporary, faster CoD." [...] She thought the game felt more classic rather than outdated, saying that [...] "It might not have the same effect it did <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> but it works as both a great embodiment of what shooters used to be and one that still plays well." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Power of BBC Music {{compared}} Homework [...] "less-is-more" [...] {{approach to}} compression's use as [...] "a sonic tribute" [...] to the FM radio stations that [...] "fed Daft Punk's youthful obsessions." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that [...] "while a few tracks are more daft than deft," [...] more recent groundbreakers like The Avalanches could never exist without [...] "Da Funk". Ian Mathers of Stylus Magazine noted that [...] "there's {{a core of}} unimpeachably classic work on Homework, hidden among the merely good, and when you've got such a classic debut hidden in {{the outlines of the}} epic slouch of their debut, it's hard not to get frustrated." [...] Rolling Stone awarded the album three stars out of five, commenting that [...] "the duo's essential, career-defining insight is that the problem with disco <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>around</b> was not that it was stupid but that it was not stupid enough." [...] Rolling Stone ranked Homework at the top on their list of [...] "The 30 Greatest EDM Albums of All Time" [...] while affirming that Daft Punk's debut [...] "is pure synapse-tweaking brilliance." [...] According to Scott Woods of The Village Voice, [...] "Daft Punk [...] the lid off the [...] sewer" [...] with the release of Homework. Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork awarded it 7.6 out of 10. He stated that [...] "Homework provides sixteen whole tracks of modern-day boom box bass n' drum and unlike your science project, it doesn't require a lot of intricate calculations to figure out how it works." [...] In his view, [...] "It sounds like an Atari 2600 on a killing spree." [...] By contrast, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice cited [...] "Da Funk" [...] as a [...] "choice cut", indicating [...] "a good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money". Darren Gawle from Drop-D Magazine also gave a negative review, stating that [...] "Homework is the work of a couple of DJs who sound amateurish at best." ...|$|E
500|$|Sam & Max Hit the Road {{received}} a favorable reception from the gaming industry's press, holding {{a rating of}} 84% on the review aggregator site GameRankings. Charles Ardai of Computer Gaming World in 1994 liked it [...] "measurably less" [...] than Day of the Tentacle. He compared the latter to a Looney Tunes cartoon and the former to an underground comic book, observing that Sam & Maxs style of humor [...] "can all be funny, but only to a point ... its main characters are basically jerks" [...] and the story was unimportant [...] "even to them". Ardai cited the completely optional and disconnected minigames as [...] "contribut to the feeling that Sam & Max is more a computerized busybox ... than a unified, focused piece of fiction". He liked the graphics and simplified SCUMM interface, but concluded that [...] "the whole is rather less {{than the sum of}} its parts ... Sam & Max affords a couple of hours of somewhat similar amusement" [...] to Tentacle. Edge noted that [...] "with most adventure games, its hard to feel anything for the character(s) you control", but stated that Sam & Max Hit the Road broke this mold by being [...] "genuinely funny" [...] and players would be [...] "experimenting more than... normally just to see what the madcap pair will get up to next." [...] The reviewer praised the game's graphics as [...] "beautifully detailed" [...] and the puzzles as [...] "intricate to solve", but noted that a number of the minigames were [...] "dismal". Joonas Linkola, writing for Adventure Gamers, echoed many of these comments, praising the cartoon-style graphics as [...] "appropriately cheesy" [...] and [...] "colorful". On the subject of the game's humor, Linkola noted that [...] "there are many visual jokes, but the backbone of the game is in its witty dialogue", and as such this gave the game a [...] "replayability value" [...] as players may pick up on jokes based on [...] "verbal acrobatics, on the use of polysyllabic words, old English and other such oddities" [...] that they missed <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>around.</b> Linkola gave additional praise to the soundtrack and audio work, stating that the [...] "very fitting voices... adds to the comical duo's wisecracking attitude".|$|E
