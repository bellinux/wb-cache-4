5|$|In an aerotow a powered {{aircraft}} {{is attached}} to a glider with a tow rope. Single-engined light aircraft or motor gliders are commonly used. The tow-plane takes the glider to the height and location requested by the pilot where the glider pilot releases the <b>tow-rope.</b> A weak link is often fitted to the rope to ensure that any sudden loads do not damage the airframe of the tow-plane or the glider. Under extreme loads the weak link will fail before any part of the glider or plane fails. There is a remote chance that the weak link might break at low altitude, and so pilots plan for this eventuality before launching.|$|E
5|$|For {{reasons of}} security, Sturmabteilung Koch was {{dispersed}} around several {{locations in the}} Rhineland until it received orders for the operation against Fort Eben-Emael and the three bridges to begin. Preliminary orders were received on 9 May, ordering the separated detachments {{to move to a}} pre-arranged concentration area, and shortly afterwards a second order arrived, informing the assault force that Fall Gelb was to begin at 05:25 on 10 May. At 04:30, forty-two gliders carrying the 493 airborne troops that formed the assault force were lifted off from two airfields in Cologne, the armada of gliders and transport aircraft turning south towards their objectives. The aircraft maintained strict radio silence, forcing the pilots to rely on a chain of signal fires that pointed towards Belgium; the radio silence also ensured that senior commanders of the assault force could not be informed that the tow-ropes on one of the gliders had snapped, forcing the glider to land inside Germany. The pilot of a second glider released his <b>tow-rope</b> prematurely, and was unable to land near its objective. Both gliders were carrying troops assigned to Group Granite and were destined to assault Fort Eben-Emael, thereby leaving the group understrength; it also left it under the command of Oberleutnant Witzig's second-in-command, as Witzig was in one of the gliders forced to land. The remaining gliders were released from their tow-ropes twenty miles away from their objectives at an altitude of , which was deemed high enough for the gliders to land by the three bridges and on top of the fort, and also maintain a steep dive angle to further ensure they landed correctly. After the Ju-52's released the gliders and began turning away, Belgian anti-aircraft artillery positions detected them and opened fire. This alerted the defences in the area to the presence of the gliders.|$|E
25|$|She was {{decommissioned}} {{from active}} service in February 1944. She saw some {{use as a}} target, to determine {{the damage caused by}} depth charges in full-scale trials. After surviving these experiments, she was to be towed by the Royal Navy rescue tug HMRT Growler from Chatham to the Clyde for scrapping. But on 19 March 1944 her <b>tow–rope</b> broke in gale-force winds and, driven by wind and waves, she ran aground at a position , near Coul Point, on the west coast of Islay, Scotland. Growler was unable to re-float the submarine and she was abandoned.|$|E
50|$|A Glider Training Squadron was formed, and {{the first}} test-flights were {{conducted}} using Swallow light aircraft which had their propellors removed to simulate the flight characteristics of a glider; they were towed by the Whitleys using <b>tow-ropes</b> of varying number and length for experimentation purposes. Appeals were made throughout the United Kingdom for civilian gliders to be donated to the squadron, {{and the first}} four arrived in August; {{three of them had}} been manufactured in pre-war Germany. Soon several more were donated, and these were put to use training instructors, glider pilots and newly formed ground crews. Accidents were quite frequent in these early months, primarily due to the hemp <b>tow-ropes</b> breaking during flight; these problems were only solved with the introduction of nylon <b>tow-ropes</b> imported from the USA. The first demonstration of the squadron's abilities took place on 26 September, when Prince George, Duke of Kent witnessed a demonstration of the fledgling airborne establishment's capabilities: four parachute-drops were conducted, and then two gliders were towed by civilian aircraft. This was followed on 26 October by a night exercise being conducted by the squadron, with two Avro 504s towing four gliders, and on 13 December five gliders were towed to Tatton Park, where they landed alongside sixteen parachutists dropped from two Whitley bombers.|$|R
60|$|First, {{there was}} the fur-laden keel boat in which we travelled, gone forever now from Western navigation. It had its rude square sail to take {{advantage}} of the river winds, its mast strongly braced to hold the long <b>tow-ropes.</b> But <b>tow-ropes</b> were for the endless up-river journey, when a numerous crew strained day after day along the bank, chanting the voyageurs' songs. Now we were light-manned, two half-breeds and two Canadians to handle the oars in time of peril, and Captain Xavier, who stood aft on the cabin roof, leaning against the heavy beam of the long, curved tiller, watching hawklike for snag and eddy and bar. Within the cabin was a great fireplace of stones, where our cooking was done, and bunks set round for the men in cold weather and rainy. But in these fair nights we chose to sleep on deck.|$|R
50|$|During the Battle of Dover Strait, on {{the night}} of 26-27 October 1916 off Folkestone Nubians bows were almost severed by a German torpedo that {{exploded}} almost under her bridge. She was taken in tow but the <b>tow-ropes</b> severed in the bad weather conditions and she ran aground on the South Foreland, near Dover. The bow then parted completely on a chalk reef and the remainder of the ship was driven under a cliff. Two of the crew of Nubian died and a further thirteen were missing, believed killed.|$|R
25|$|Operation Husky {{began on}} the night of 9 July with an {{airborne}} assault by the 1st Airlanding Brigade (now commanded by Brigadier Philip Hicks) and the 1st Parachute Brigade of the 1st Airborne Division, and elements of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, with both divisions suffering heavy losses in men and equipment as they carried out their objectives. Due to a number of factors, including poor navigation and the inexperience of the pilots of the transport aircraft, many of the gliders transporting the 1st Airlanding Brigade failed to reach their assigned landing zones. One such glider carried Hopkinson and members of his staff; the <b>tow-rope</b> of the glider was detached prematurely and it was forced to ditch in the ocean. Although uninjured, Hopkinson was forced to wait by the partially submerged glider until daylight, when he was picked up a Royal Navy destroyer. After both brigades had accomplished their missions, despite heavy casualties, they were withdrawn to North Africa to recover, and Allied ground forces began to fight through Sicily; fighting there ended on 17 August, and in early September the Allies launched their invasion of Italy itself.|$|E
500|$|The {{flights were}} carried out between 3June and 7July; the first Horsas arrived at Kairouran on 28June, only twelve days before {{they were to be}} used in Operation Ladbroke. During the flight from England, for its first three hours over the Bay of Biscay the Halifax–Horsa {{combination}} was escorted by RAF Bristol Beaufighters or Mosquito long-range fighter aircraft. They kept to an altitude of [...] to avoid German radar so the escorting fighters could return safely when short of fuel. The mission was not without its dangers. Four hours into one flight, a Horsa snapped its <b>tow-rope</b> while trying to avoid low cloud and ditched in the sea. Another Horsa and Halifax were discovered by a pair of German Focke-Wulf Fw 200s and shot down. After surviving attacks from Luftwaffe fighter patrols and experiencing often-turbulent weather, a total of twenty-seven Horsas were delivered to North Africa in time for the invasion of Sicily. The total losses during the flights were three Halifaxes and five Horsas, with twenty-one RAF aircrew and seven glider pilots killed.|$|E
2500|$|... 14 clinker-built wooden lifeboats, {{measuring}} [...] long by [...] wide by [...] deep. Each had {{a capacity}} of [...] and was designed to carry 65 people. The rudders were made of elm– selected because it resisted splitting– and were [...] thick. The exterior of the boats were fitted with [...] "grablines" [...] {{for people in the}} water to hold on to. They were fitted with a variety of equipment to aid the occupants, comprising 10 oars, a sea anchor, two bailers, a painter (effectively a <b>tow-rope)</b> [...] long, two boat-hooks, two [...] tanks of fresh water, a mast and sail, a compass, a lantern and watertight metal provision tanks which contained biscuits. This equipment was not kept in the boats for fear of theft, but in locked boxes on the deck. In many cases, the equipment was not transferred to the boats when they were launched on 15 April and ended up going down with the ship. Blankets and a spare lifebelt could also be found in the boats. [...] Apparently unknown to many officers and crew, these boats were reinforced with steel beams in their keels to prevent buckling in the davits under a full load.|$|E
50|$|Both {{smaller and}} wider punts are made. Extra large and wide punts known as ferry punts {{may be seen}} in Cambridge, where many are used as {{water-borne}} tourist vehicles. Single seater Thames punts were normally made only 2 feet (60 cm) wide, and somewhat shorter than a standard punt; very few of these are still afloat. Racing punts, which are still used by a few specialist clubs on the lower Thames, may be built even narrower. Thames punts have occasionally been adapted for other means of propulsion: including sails, <b>tow-ropes,</b> and paddle wheels. With the addition of iron hoops and canvas awnings, punts have also been used for camping.|$|R
50|$|The Pissaillas Glacier offers summer skiing, {{as well as}} {{the usual}} winter fare. Snow cannon are placed on certain slopes to {{accommodate}} heavy skiing. The ski slopes themselves are equipped with a high-volume gondola, able to transport standing skiers, the funicular Funival from La Daille via a tunnel to the top of Bellevarde, traditional chair lifts—some with windshields and many detachable, button/disc-pulls and <b>tow-ropes.</b> There are both groomed slopes and backcountry (off-piste) skiing. The slopes' difficulty levels are particularly high. However, as in Tignes there are wide, easily navigable pistes for those of the beginner-intermediate level as well. Its extensive off-piste facilities include guides for safety reasons; reviews are generally favourable.|$|R
5000|$|Ship {{navigation}} {{is controlled}} with the mouse. Players can set waypoints for the ship's course and attacks targets, Interaction is also featured, such as focusing the viewpoint on objects, initiating docking manoeuvres, firing <b>tow-ropes</b> and grappling hooks, and, when {{used on the}} player ship, activating the cloaking device (only available on the Procyon Submersible). In line with the [...] "classical nautical" [...] design of the ships and the universe in general, the speed control is designed {{to look like an}} engine order telegraph. There are 4 speeds, Full Stop, Ahead Slow, Ahead Full and Emergency Full. Speed affects turning rate, a faster speed results in a wider turning circle.|$|R
60|$|Towing.--A {{good way}} of {{fastening}} a <b>tow-rope</b> to a boat that has no mast {{is shown in the}} diagram, which, however, is very coarsely drawn. A curved pole is lashed alongside one of the knees of the boat, and the <b>tow-rope,</b> passing with a turn or two round its end, is carried on to the stern of the boat. By taking a few turns, more or less, with the rope round the stick, the line of action of the <b>tow-rope</b> on the boat's axis may be properly adjusted. When all is right the boat ought to steer herself.|$|E

6000|$|... "Before we do {{anything}} more," [...] Frank said, [...] "I will swim {{with a light}} line to that tree, and then haul the <b>tow-rope</b> after me, and make it fast to it; {{it is possible that}} when we cut away some of the other boughs the whole affair may turn over and sink, but if the <b>tow-rope</b> is fast {{we may be able to}} drag it alongside." ...|$|E
50|$|FitzGerald, {{in common}} with others {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century, became obsessed with the desire to fly. His {{attempts}} in College Park, Dublin, in 1895 involved large numbers of students pulling <b>tow-ropes</b> attached to the Lilienthal glider, and attracted the attention of the people of Dublin, beyond the Nassau Street railings. FitzGerald took off his coat on these occasions, but retained his top hat, which was normal headgear for a Fellow at that time.The experiments were not crowned with success, and were eventually abandoned. The flying machine hung for many years in the Museum Building until an idle engineering student applied a match to the cord from which it was hanging. The flame travelled along the cord and consumed the glider before the helpless onlookers.|$|R
60|$|As {{the cavalry}} passed the Great Cataract {{they had an}} {{opportunity}} of seeing {{the process of getting}} the boats up. The rush of waters was tremendous, and it seemed well-nigh impossible to force the boats against them. It would indeed have been impossible to row them, and they were dragged up by <b>tow-ropes</b> by the united strength of the troops and a large number of natives. At times, {{in spite of all the}} efforts of the men at the ropes, the boats made no progress whatever, while if the steersman allowed the stream for a moment to take the boat's head it would be whirled round and carried down to the foot of the rapid, when the work had to be recommenced.|$|R
50|$|Although it {{is unclear}} whether formal {{authorisation}} was actually granted, the station began to appear in the railway company's timetables in June 1903. The name Udiam Halt was first used but this was soon abandoned in favour of Junction Road (for Hawkhurst), even though the village of Hawkhurst was some 4 mi away and had been served by its own railway station for the last eleven years. A lack of funds meant that no station buildings were provided at Junction Road, the station consisting merely of a single unsheltered platform constructed of wood and earth. In 1909, a siding was commissioned on the western side of the B2244 on the Up side of the line facing Robertsbridge and this was controlled by a two-levered ground frame situated nearby. The position of the siding meant that trains wishing to shunt here had to be <b>tow-roped.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Next day {{we got the}} tug off Dungeness; {{and when}} the <b>tow-rope</b> was fast Charley rubbed his hands and said to me in an undertone-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Alf, clap {{on to this}} <b>tow-rope,</b> an' {{stop your}} nonsense," [...] said Captain Vane, who {{was not in a}} poetical frame of mind just then.|$|E
6000|$|He stopped, for the <b>tow-rope</b> slipped noisily {{across the}} horse. There was a clang of iron as the hook took the strain, {{and the captain}} frowned. [...] "That hulk is going to bother us before very long." ...|$|E
60|$|Next day we {{went down}} to the harbour, where the sailors of all nations were {{discharging}} and taking in cargoes of all kinds: fruits, wines, oils, silks, stuffs, velvets, and every manner of merchandise. Taking one of a great number of lively little boats with gay-striped awnings, we rowed away, under the sterns of great ships, under <b>tow-ropes</b> and cables, against and among other boats, and very much too near the sides of vessels that were faint with oranges, to the Marie Antoinette, a handsome steamer bound for Genoa, lying near the mouth of the harbour. By-and-by, the carriage, that unwieldy 'trifle from the Pantechnicon,' on a flat barge, bumping against everything, and giving occasion for a prodigious quantity of oaths and grimaces, came stupidly alongside; and by five o'clock we were steaming out in the open sea. The vessel was beautifully clean; the meals were served under an awning on deck; the night was calm and clear; the quiet beauty of the sea and sky unspeakable.|$|R
60|$|The {{dramatic}} {{character of}} the enterprise and its picturesque and original features fascinated the nation, and the advance was watched with breathless interest. The fortunes of the River Column have been graphically described by one who played no small part in their attempt. 'The Campaign of the Cataracts' [By Sir William Butler] is a record of hard and unceasing toil. Day after day the long lines of soldiers hauled on the <b>tow-ropes</b> or pulled at the oars of the broad-bottomed boats. Night after night they camped on the banks amid the grim desolation of the Monassir Desert. Yet their monotonous labours were encouraged {{by the knowledge that}} as soon as the bend of the river at Abu Hamed was reached the strong north wind would carry them swiftly to Khartoum. And it seemed a strange and bitter irony that the order to turn back and the news that all had been in vain was announced to the troops on the very day when they had cleared the cataracts and were moving forward at five times their former speed.|$|R
5000|$|Smethwick Junction has two Horseley Ironworks roving bridges dated 1828. They {{were built}} {{as part of}} Thomas Telford's {{improvements}} to the Birmingham Canal. One crosses the main line {{to the east of}} the junction, and the other crosses the old main line to the west. Each bridge has a span of 52.5 ft and the arch rises 9 ft. The semi-elliptical form gives greater headroom above the towpaths. The ribs were manufactured in two parts and are bolted at the crown. They have an X-lattice structure with a decorative quatrefoil pattern below the handrail. The deck is of cast-iron plates with raised ribs 2.5 in high cast on their upper surfaces to help retain the earth filling which forms the footway. The bridge abutments and wing walls are of brick with stone facings at the corners. There are deep cuts in the ironwork of the bridges caused by the abrasion of <b>tow-ropes.</b> Both bridges are grade II listed structures, but the one to the west is in the best condition, as the eastern bridge has had one of its abutments repaired in the twentieth century with modern brick and concrete.|$|R
60|$|Voices of {{men came}} to her from down the river-bank, and the {{splashing}} of water. She glanced quickly and saw Del Bishop guiding a poling-boat against the current, and Corliss on the bank, bending to the <b>tow-rope.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He {{fastened}} the <b>tow-rope</b> to {{the rear}} axle of his car, {{to the front of}} hers. [...] "Now will you be ready to put on all your power as I begin to pull?" [...] he said casually, rather respectfully.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, {{that were}} impossible. A jerk from the <b>tow-rope</b> of a steamer {{at full speed}} would tear us asunder. Have you {{observed}} these two strong ropes running all round our gunwale, and the bridles across with ring-bolts in them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{will also}} arrange the crews of each boat. I beg {{that you will}} all inscribe your names as ready to fight for your homes, families, and possessions, all {{of which will be}} in grievous danger unless these pirates are crushed. At seven o'clock this evening those who have volunteered will {{assemble}} at the fort. The boats will be in readiness with a number painted on each, so that when you are told off you will be able each one to take his place without confusion in his allotted boat, or in one or other of the ships. The pirates will make their landing about eleven o'clock. The boats will row till within three miles of them, then they will be taken in tow by the ships. The sounds of the boats' oars would be heard for a long way on a still night. You will probably get quite close to them before you are seen. The moment the alarm is given, the <b>tow-ropes</b> must be thrown off. The ships will fire a broadside into the man-of-war, and at once range alongside her, and the boats will attack the other pirates." ...|$|R
60|$|Casting off the <b>tow-rope,</b> {{they turned}} the bow of their canoe to the island. As a stiffish breeze was blowing, they set the sails, close-reefed, and steered for the {{southern}} shore at that part which lay {{under the shadow of}} Rakata.|$|E
60|$|The <b>tow-rope</b> {{tightened}} as the gig {{swung into}} line astern, {{and they moved}} steadily toward the land for some time. Then they heard a roar of steam again, louder than before and continuous, and the lieutenant signed to the engineer.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now,' said Mr Inspector, {{again to}} Riderhood, {{when they were}} all on the slushy stones; 'you have had more {{practice}} in this than I have had, {{and ought to be}} a better workman at it. Undo the <b>tow-rope,</b> and we'll help you haul in.' ...|$|E
60|$|The fog was as dense as ever--we {{moved in}} the very womb of night--but I cannot recall that I took the faintest note {{of it as the}} dinghy, guided by the <b>tow-rope,</b> {{disappeared}} toward the Agatha, Pyecroft rowing. The bell began again on the starboard bow.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly {{the dried}} meat and flour were {{transferred}} to the canoe, the kettles were filled up with fresh water, and, after taking a long drink and letting Jack lap {{as much as he}} could take, they took their seats in the canoe again, threw off the <b>tow-rope</b> and started due west.|$|E
6000|$|Whenever a climber {{tried to}} assist himself by the rope, it yielded {{and let him}} tumble backward. The {{frequency}} of this result suggested an idea to me. I ordered the caravan to 'bout face and form in marching order; I then made the <b>tow-rope</b> fast to the rear mule, and gave the command: ...|$|E
60|$|She {{switched}} off the power--and suddenly {{she was in a}} whirlwind of dizzy sickening tiredness. Even in her abandonment to exhaustion she noticed that the young man did not stare at her but, keeping his back to her, removed the <b>tow-rope,</b> and stowed it away in his bug. She wondered whether it was tact or yokelish indifference.|$|E
60|$|Austin {{stopped the}} launch and cast the <b>tow-rope</b> off, and the lighter, driving forward, slid {{in under the}} big grain tramp's side. A few minutes later Jefferson {{appeared}} at her gangway, and when Austin ran in jumped on board. He was a tall man, and was just then very wet, and as black as any coal heaver. This, however, rather added to the suggestion of forcefulness that usually characterised him.|$|E
