5|$|Ronald Lockley (1903–2000), {{among many}} studies of birds in over fifty books, pioneered {{the science of}} bird migration. He made a twelve-year study of shearwaters such as the Manx shearwater, living on the remote island of Skokholm. These small seabirds make {{one of the longest}} migrations of any bird—10,000 kilometres—but return to the exact nesting burrow on Skokholm year after year.

5|$|The British {{government}} was also slow {{in responding to}} requests for compensation. While waiting for a response, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> to use any compensation was debated in provincial newspapers and pamphlets. Some, such as Samuel Adams (father of the famous American Revolution leader), advocated placing the money in London banks to serve as backing for the paper currency issued by the colonies. Others, including William Douglass and Thomas Hutchinson, speaker of the General Court, favoured using the compensation to redeem the paper currency and give Massachusetts a hard currency. In 1748 the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle returned Louibourg to France, with Massachusetts still awaiting compensation for its seizure.|$|E
5|$|The {{revival of}} ramming had a {{significant}} effect on naval tactics. Since the 17th century the predominant tactic of naval warfare had been the line of battle, where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns. This tactic was totally unsuited to ramming, and the ram threw fleet tactics into disarray. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle, and if it had been, combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water.|$|E

5|$|Feminism {{became a}} {{principal}} concern of musicologists in the 1980s {{as part of}} the New Musicology. Prior to this, in the 1970s, musicologists were beginning to discover women composers and performers, and had begun to review concepts of canon, genius, genre and periodization from a feminist perspective. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> women musicians fit into traditional music history was now being asked. Through the 1980s and 1990s, this trend continued as musicologists like Susan McClary, Marcia Citron and Ruth Solie began to consider the cultural reasons for the marginalizing of women from the received body of work. Concepts such as music as gendered discourse; professionalism; reception of women's music; examination of the sites of music production; relative wealth and education of women; popular music studies in relation to women's identity; patriarchal ideas in music analysis; and notions of gender and difference are among the themes examined during this time.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Commission's {{proposal}} led to {{a debate}} between senior officers in the Navy and the Koninklijke Landmacht (Royal Netherlands Army) over how to best protect the NEI, and <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> {{the cost of the}} ships should be split between the Netherlands and the NEI also was not settled until July 1914. After considering the recommendations, the Dutch Government decided to acquire four battleships, and a bill seeking funding for them was introduced into the Dutch parliament in August 1914. However, this was withdrawn following the outbreak of the First World War that month. A new royal commission into Dutch defense needs held after the war did not recommend that battleships be procured and none were ever ordered.|$|E
5|$|The {{iconography}} {{of the ceiling}} has had various interpretations in the past, some elements {{of which have been}} contradicted by modern scholarship.

Modern scholars have sought, as yet unsuccessfully, to determine a written source of the theological program of the ceiling and have questioned {{whether or not it was}} entirely devised by the artist himself, who was both an avid reader of the Bible and a genius. Also of interest to some modern scholars is <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> Michelangelo's own spiritual and psychological state is reflected in the iconography and the expression of the ceiling.

5|$|Supporters of the emergentist {{coalition}} model argue that, as a hybrid, {{this model}} moves towards a more holistic explanation of word learning {{that is not}} captured by models with a singular focus. For instance, constraints theories typically argue that constraints/principles are available to children from the onset of word learning, but do not explain how children develop into expert speakers who are not limited by constraints. Additionally, some argue that domain-general perspectives do not fully address <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> children sort through numerous potential referents in order to correctly sort out meaning. Lastly, social pragmatic theories claim that social encounters guide word learning. Although these theories describe how children become more advanced word learners, they seem to tell us little about children's capacities {{at the start of}} word learning. According to its proponents, the emergentist coalion model incorporates constraints/principles, but argues for the development and change in these principles over time, while simultaneously taking into consideration social aspects of word learning alongside other cues, such as salience.|$|E
5|$|The 1894-S Barber dime {{is one of}} {{the great}} numismatic rarities, with a {{published}} mintage of 24 proof pieces. Various stories attend <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> so few came to be coined. According to Nancy Oliver and Richard Kelly in their 2011 article for The Numismatist, the San Francisco Mint in June 1894 needed to coin $2.40 in silver left over from the melting of worn-out coins, just enough to coin 24 dimes. More ten-cent pieces were expected to be struck there later in the year, but this did not occur. Breen, on the other hand, related that San Francisco Mint Superintendent John Daggett had the dimes struck for a group of banker friends, giving three to each. He also gave three to his young daughter Hallie, telling her to retain them until she was as old as he was, and she would be able to sell them for a good price. According to the story, she spent one on a dish of ice cream, but kept the other two until 1954. One of the approximately nine known dimes was retrieved from circulation in 1957, and Breen speculated this may have been the ice cream specimen. One sold for $1,552,500 at auction in 2007.|$|E
5|$|This theory {{stems from}} the various rumours {{spreading}} after Centaurs sinking. If Centaur had been in breach of the Hague Convention of 1907, and someone had informed the Japanese of this, I-177 may have been under valid orders to attack. When Centaur left Sydney, her decks were packed with green-uniformed men, and as Field Ambulance uniforms were only distinguishable from other Army uniforms by badge insignia and the colouration of the cloth band ringing the hat, a distant observer could {{have concluded that the}} hospital ship was transporting soldiers. Those witnessing the loading in Sydney would have seen the ambulance drivers bring their weapons aboard, and could have come to a similar conclusion. If a spy or informant had passed this information to the Japanese, I-177 could have been lying in wait. The main flaw in this theory is <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> Nakagawa and his crew were able to predict that Centaur was taking an alternative route and how they were able to determine the new route selected.|$|E
