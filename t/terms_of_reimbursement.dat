However, while {{the cost of}} manufacture is uncertain it can be reduced by an amount depending {{on the extent of}} effort exerted by the agent. The effort exerted by the agent is not verifiable but causes disutility to the agent, hence, its extent will ultimately depend on the power of incentives built into the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> agreed to in the contract. The analysis in the paper explicitly models the possibility that the agentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beliefs are ambiguous and the agent is ambiguity averse.

Savova; Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Social Pharmacy and Pharmacoeconomics Medical University; 2 Dunav Str.; 1000 Sofia, Bulgaria; e-mail: alex_savov@mail. bgThe {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to investigate and calculate the direct medical costs of osteoporosis, the indirect ones, as well as the family costs in Bulgaria. A top down retrospective cost study has been developed. Epidemiology data for osteoporosis has been derived from two published reports. The information on the prices of medicines, patient co-payment, level of reimbursement, hospitalization cost and average hospital stay is based on the offi cial national sources. Offi cial information provided by the National Health Insurance Fund is that in 2009 only 2, 143, 046 BGN for 5, 950 treated patients were paid. The annual cost of femoral fractures should be 8 million BGN, and 800, 000 BGN for rehabilitation. The rest of the fractures are mild and account for 26, 950, 000 BGN. The average disability loses account for approximately 23, 105, 472 BGN. The direct medical cost exhibits the proportion of 2 million for medicines to 36 million BGN for treatment of fractures. The major conclusions from our analysis are that the patients with osteoporosis in Bulgaria are not adequately treated in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> coverage and patients carry the greater part of fi nancial and social burden...|$|E

Methods: A field study to measure prices of selected medicines was undertaken in Thailand using a standardized methodology developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Action International (HAI). Prices of 43 medicines were measured in health facilities and pharmacies in the capital city and three districts in different parts of Thailand. Medicine prices were expressed as the ratios relative to a standard set of international reference prices (median price ratio or MPR). Results: The public sector procured generics and innovator brands at 1. 46 and 3. 3 MPR while patients paid 2. 55 and 4. 36 MPR, respectively. Private pharmacies procured lowest price generics at 1. 48 MPR and innovator brands at 9. 67 MPR. Because of no medicine pricing policy in Thailand, it was found that between public and private sectors, among different public hospitals, and among different private pharmacies, the same generic products were procured and sold to patients at different prices. The median mark-up for innovator brands were 31 % in the public sector and 22 % in the private sector. For lowest priced generics, the median mark-up were 80 % in the public sector and 96 % in the private sector. Different prices for the identical product were problems to the health insurance organizations in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement,</b> and to patients in terms of fairness...|$|E
40|$|The {{companion}} {{paper on}} nursing home levels of care (Bishop, Plough and Willemain, 1980) recommended a "split-rate " approach to nursing home reimbursement that would distinguish between fixed and variable costs. This paper examines three alternative treatments of the variable cost {{component of the}} rate: a two-level system similar to the distinction between skilled and intermediate care facilities, an individualized ("patient-centered") system, and a system that assigns a single facility-specific rate {{that depends on the}} facility's case-mix ("case-mix reimbursement"). The aim is to better understand the theoretical strengths and weaknesses of these three approaches. The comparison <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> alternatives is framed in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> minimizing <b>reimbursement</b> error, meaning overpayment and underpayment.

We examine how variation in reimbursement incentives and administration among two Medicaid managed care plans impacts utilization and spending. We use a quasi-experimental approach exploiting the timing and county-specific implementation of Medicaid managed care mandates in two contiguous regions of Kentucky. We find large differences in the relative success of each plan in reducing utilization and spending that are likely driven by important differences in plan design. The plan that capitated primary care physicians and contracted out many administrative responsibilities to an experienced managed care organization achieved significant reductions in outpatient and professional utilization. The plan that opted for a fee-for-service reimbursement scheme with a group withhold and handled administration internally saw a much more modest reduction in outpatient utilization and an increase in professional utilization...|$|R
40|$|For {{a correct}} {{classification}} of dysphagia, morphologic instrumental investigations capable of analysing the anatomical {{structures of the}} digestive tract, are undoubtedly essential, {{but the most important}} investigations are the functional investigations, such as videofluoroscopy, fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing, oro-pharyngo-oesophageal scintigraphy, manometry and pH-metry. Results of these examinations enable us to identify, in patients with dysphagia, the extent of permanent damage, as a consequence of injury to the structures designated to swallowing, must be such that it at least minimally impairs and decreases the relative function, but to a degree that can be detected and, in some manner, measured. From a legal point of view, alterations in swallowing, caused by damage to structures belonging to the respiratory-digestive tract, can be found in crimes against persons and particularly in those involving body injury. In the case of civil, but also in private or social insurance proceedings, it is necessary to distinguish which parameters are to be used as reference for evaluating and quantifying the injury in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement.</b> With the introduction of complete biological well-being, injury is considered as an impairment of the worth and right to enjoy psychological-physical integrity as a quality of life.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a positive theory about the contractual form of procurement contracts under cost uncertainty. While {{the cost of}} manufacture is uncertain it can be controlled, to an extent depending on the effort exerted by the agent. The effort exerted by the agent is not contractible but causes disutility to the agent. Hence, the amount of effort exerted depends {{on the power of}} incentives built into the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> agreed to in the contract. The analysis in the paper explicitly models the possibility that the belief about the cost uncertainty is ambiguous, in the sense that belief is described by a set of probabilities, rather than by a single probability. This allows us to incorporate ambiguity aversion (behavior of the kind seen in Ellsberg`s "paradox") into the players` objective functions. The paper finds that, provided the agent is more averse to ambiguity than the principal, the more the ambiguity of belief the lower the power of the optimal incentive scheme. The fix-price contract is optimal if there is no ambiguity, but if the ambiguity is high enough a cost-plus contract is optimal; in between, a cost-share scheme is optimal. It is contended that the finding is particularly useful in explaining facts about the wide use of cost-plus and similar low powered contracts in research and development (R&D) procurement by the U. S. Department of Defense. Procurement contracts, Incentive contracts, Uncertainty aversion, Ellsberg`s paradox, Cost reimbursement contracts, Cost-plus contracts, Fixed price contracts...|$|E

Methods: The dynamic model calculates the budget impact from two different perspectives: (a) the impact on healthcare expenditures and (b) on expenditures as well as on health insurance revenues due to premiums. The latter approach could especially be useful for patients with chronic diseases who have higher probabilities of early retirement. Early retirement rates and indirect costs were derived from published data. Healthcare premiums were calculated based on an average premium and a mean income. Epidemiological input data were obtained from the literature. Time horizon was 10 years. Results: Results in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> decisions of the budget impact analysis varied depending on the assumptions made for the insurance premiums, costs, and early retirement rate. Sensitivity analyses revealed that in extreme cases the decision for accepting a new pharmaceutical product would probably be negative using approach (a), but positive using approach (b). Conclusions: Depending on the disease and population of interest in a budget impact analysis, not only the healthcare expenditures for a health insurance have to be considered but also the revenue side for an insurance due to retirement should be included.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the article is to objectivise and assess the costs for the lung cancer therapy from the payer’s (health insurance company) and the healthcare provider’s (hospital) perspective based on information available from several large hospitals and specialised centres. No comprehensive assessment of costs related {{to the treatment of}} lung cancers at all stages has been published in the Czech Republic to-date. The results in this study are calculated based on diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms, i. e. process maps. These, in turn, are derived from the recommended therapeutic procedures issued by the Masaryk Institute of Oncology, the University Hospital in Hradec Králové and the University Hospital in PlzeÀ. In total, the costs and reimbursements were calculated for 32 utilized algorithms, i. e. process maps. The costs for therapeutic processes account for 22 results, while 10 results correspond to diagnostic processes. Both direct and indirect costs were included in individual calculations. The calculations imply that treatment costs significantly differ depending on the selected diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. It becomes apparent that the setting of the reimbursement system presently generates different stimuli for providers, who may reach both positive and negative balances. This fact, in turn, may {{have an effect on the}} economic result leading, in its consequence, to the preference of more suitable alternatives in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> regardless of the optimum procedures for the particular patient. This fact is, to a certain extent, reflected by the reimbursements calculated by means of the DRG system.

The {{aim of the}} present study was to describe aspects of prescription of antidepresant drug therapy among patients on OMT. Our research questions were: 1) What is the prevalence of antidepressant use according to age and gender? 2) Which antidepressants are used? 3) How are antidepressants used in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> codes, dispensed dose and duration of therapy? Methods: Pharmacoepidemiological data were retrieved from the complete national Norwegian Prescription Database which contains information on all prescription drugs (such as Anatomical Theraputical Chemical (ATC) -code, Defined Daily Dose (DDDs)), dispensed at pharmacies to individual patients. Norwegian OMT-patients (N= 4374, 3035 men and 1339 women) who received methadone mixture, buprenorphine capsules or combined buprenorphine-naloxone capsules for at least 6 months in 2009 were included. Prevalence of antidepressant use in the studied patients was measured in terms of retrieval of prescriptions. Results: During 2009 21. 7 % of the studied patients filled at least one prescription for an antidepressant drugs (men: 21. 2 %; women: 22. 9 %). The subgroup of antidepressants most frequently dispensed was selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (33 %), followed by the sedative antidepressants mianserin and mirtazapin (22 %) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (20 %). Except for TCAs, prescriptions of all antidepressant subgroups were reimbursed for either anxiety or depression in 90 % of the cases. Overall, 46. 9 % of the antidepressant users were prescribed antidepressants in the category < 1 DDD per day and/or treatment < 3 months, with no gender difference. Conclusions: About one out of five OMT-patients filled a prescription for an antidepressant drug in 2009. Above 90 % had their prescriptions reimbursed for either depression or anxiety. Use at low doses and/or sporadic use among half of the antidepressant users may reflect poor compliance or use for other maladies than the reimbursed disease code.

40|$|Introduction: Arteriosclerotic {{changes can}} lead to circulatory {{disturbances}} in various areas of the human vascular system. In addition to pharmacological therapy and the management of risk factors (e. g. hypertension, diabetes, lipid metabolism disorders, and lifestyle), surgical interventions also {{play an important role}} in the treatment of arteriosclerosis. Long-segment arterial occlusions, in particular, can be treated successfully with bypass sur-gery. A number of different materials are available for this type of operation, such as autologous vein or pros-thetic grafts comprised of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or Dacron®. Prosthetic materials are used especially in the treatment of peripheral artery disease, such as in aortoiliac or femoropopliteal bypass surgery. The present report will thus focus on this area in order to examine the effectiveness of different bypass materials. Among the efforts being made to refine the newly introduced DRG system in Germany, analysing the different bypass materials used in vascular surgery is particularly important. Indeed, in its current version the German DRG system does not distinguish between bypass materials in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> rates. Differences in cost structures are thus of especial interest to hospitals in their budget calculations, whereas both private and statutory health insurance funds are primarily interested in long-term results and their costs. Objectives: The goal of this HTA is to compare the different bypass materials used in vascular surgery in terms of their medical efficiency and cost-effectiveness, as well as with regard to their ethical, social and legal implications. In addition, this report aims to point out the areas in which further medical, epidemiological and health economic research is still needed. Methods: Relevant publications were identified by means of a structured search of databases accessed through the German Institute of Medical Documentation and Information (DIMDI), as well as by a manual search. The for-mer included the following electronic resources: SOMED (SM 78), Cochrane Library - Central (CCTR 93), MEDLINE Alert (ME 0 A), MEDLINE (ME 95), CATFILEplus (CATLINE) (CA 66), ETHMED (ED 93), GeroLit (GE 79), HECLINET (HN 69), AMED (CB 85), CAB Abstracts (CV 72), GLOBAL Health (AZ 72), IPA (IA 70), El-sevier BIOBASE (EB 94), BIOSIS Previews (BA 93), EMBASE (EM 95), EMBASE Alert (EA 08), SciSearch (IS 90), Cochrane Library - CDSR (CDSR 93), NHS-CRD-DARE (CDAR 94), NHS-CRD-HTA (INAHTA), and NHS-EED (NHSEED). The present report included German and English literature published between the years 1999 and 2004. A list of the search parameters can be found in the appendix. No limits were placed on the target population, and the methodical quality of the included studies was determined using standardised checklists. Results: The studies included in this health technology assessment compared the following bypass materials: autologous vein, human umbilical vein (HUV) and synthetic materials such as PTFE or Dacron®. Both the systematic reviews and the randomised controlled trials comparing autologous vein grafts to other bypass materials come to the conclusion that autologous vein is superior to all other materials. From a medical viewpoint, there are no clear differences between the various synthetic materials. To date, the subject of bypass materials in vascular surgery has not been addressed comprehensively from an economic point of view. Indeed, we were able to identify only one publication that compared the cost of various bypass materials. The remaining health economic studies did not compare costs, cost effectiveness, or quality of life associated with the use of various bypass materials. Discussion: When deciding which bypass material to use, vascular surgeons take a number of medical considerations into account, including the bypass area, the availability of autologous vein, the amount of operation time available, and the health status of the patient. The studies included in this health technology assessment demonstrate that autologous vein is usually the preferred material for bypass grafts. In contrast, comparisons of various synthetic materials did not show any specific differences. It remains to be seen whether studies on newly developed synthetic materials will show these to have any particular advantages. The randomised controlled trials included in the present report were limited by a number of methodological weaknesses, such as different methods for determining patency rates, sample size and power problems, the interpretation of non-significant results, and a lack of consideration of additional factors. From an economic point of view, there is still great need for further research, and we have attempted to describe a number of pressing questions for health economic studies in the present report...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroductionIntramuscular {{injection}} of botulinum toxin (BoNTA) {{is one of}} the primary treatments for focal spasticity. This treatment is considered costly and the level <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> by health insurance has been decreasing in many countries for several years. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the real cost of treating spasticity with BoNTA and to compare this with the level <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> by the national health insurance in France in 2008 and with a new fee, specific to the {{injection of}} BoNTA in ambulatory services. MethodA single-center, retrospective study using the 2008 database from a French secondary-care day-hospital unit (treating spasticity in adults with sequelae of stroke, multiple sclerosis or traumatic brain injuries). The level <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> by the French ministry of health for BoNTA treatment for adults with spasticity constituted the “calculated cost” and corresponded to the hospital's “budget”. The “real cost” (incurred by the hospital) included the sum of staffing and material costs as well as the number of toxin vials used. The calculated costs for 2009 and 2013 were based on the levels <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> during those years. The difference between real and calculated cost for 2009 and 2013 was estimated considering that the real cost of 2008 was stable. ResultsIn 2008, 364 patients received BoNTA, resulting in 870 day-hospital admissions. The calculated cost was 459, 056 €/year and the real cost was 567, 438 €/year (equivalent to 4. 27 €/day/patient). The total budget deficit (hospital income minus hospital costs) was 108, 383 €. The deficit was estimated at 222, 892 € in 2009 and 241, 188 € in 2013. ConclusionThe daily cost of BoNTA treatment for spasticity is reasonable; however, because of the level <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> by the national health insurance in France, the treatment is costly for French hospitals...|$|R

Thirty-four researchers filled out a questionnaire and returned it by electronic mail. The vast majority of the respondents (91 %) reported that the respective study protocol had been evaluated by a research ethics committee. More than half reported that they had received a previously prepared FITC; that consent from potential study subjects had been obtained by the researcher in charge; and that the subjects had received a copy of their signed FITC. Approximately one half of participants stated that the form <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> subjects was specified in the FITC, and 44 % reported the same in relation to occasional damages resulting from the study. According to participants, in general the provisions of Ruling 196 / 96 had been met...|$|R
