25|$|Following {{his meeting}} with Chilembwe and, in {{search for a new}} {{religious}} direction, Domingo corresponded with Charles Taze Russell and, after reading Russell's published writings while in Mozambique, joined the Watch Tower Society in 1909. He also established contact with Joseph Booth in South Africa and also with Elliot Kamwana before the latter was deported from Nyasaland in 1909 and, on his return to Nyasaland Domingo joined the independent Seventh-day Baptist church that Booth’s disciples had formed, and which Booth funded, in the north of the protectorate in 1910. There was no clear split between this movement and Watch Tower until the visit of an American representative of that society in late 1910, who strongly opposed Sabbatarianism. Most of congregations founded by Kamwana supported Watch Tower following his brief and illegal return by from his deportation in October 1910, but most of those begun by others of Booth’s disciples rejected Watch <b>Tower</b> <b>control.</b> By 1911, the division between the two groups was total. Despite his earlier membership of the Watch Tower movement, Domingo did not express the sort of millennial expectations that Elliot Kamwana, who predicted the start of the Millennium and the ending of colonial rule in 1914, had.|$|E
