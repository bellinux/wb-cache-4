A small Muslim community resided on Ada Kaleh island in the Danube, south of the Banat, an Ottoman enclave and later part of Austria-Hungary, which was transferred to Romania in 1923.|$|E
25|$|Following the Crimean Khanate's conquest by the Russian Empire (1783), many Tatars there {{took refuge}} in Dobruja, {{especially}} around Medgidia.

Khotyn, once part of Moldavia, was the birthplace of Alemdar Mustafa Pasha, who was the Ottoman Grand Vizier until 1808. Two more Grand Viziers between 1821 and 1828 came from Bender (a once Moldavian city), as Benderli Pashas.|$|E
50|$|Romania has {{the highest}} wind {{potential}} in continental Europe of 14,000 MW; in 2009 investors already had connection requests of 12,000 MW and the national electricity transport company Transelectrica offered permits for 2,200 MW. A study of Erste Bank places Romania and especially the Dobrogea Region with Constanţa and <b>Tulcea</b> <b>counties</b> as the second best place in Europe (after Scotland) to construct wind farms due to its large wind potential. Another study made by the Romanian Energy Institute (REI) said that wind farms could contribute with 13 GW to the national power generation capacity by 2020, and between 2009 and 2017 total wind farm capacity will comprise 4,000 MW with investments of US$5.6 billion.|$|R

25|$|In October 1949, the {{authorities}} established a General Directorate to oversee both the works and the penal facilities, answering {{directly to the}} national leadership. Its first head was the Gheorghe Hossu a former mechanic and tractor-driver who had been promoted first-secretary of the Romanian Worker's party in <b>Tulcea</b> <b>County</b> and administrator of the State Fisheries. He was replaced in 1951 by Meyer Grünberg, in turn replaced by Mihail Povstanschi {{under the name of}} (Vasile Posteucă) (who held the position in 1952–1953). According to historian Adrian Cioroianu, all three were insufficiently trained for the task they were required to accomplish. By 1952, the Directorate came under the direct supervision of the Internal Affairs Ministry, and the Securitate was allowed direct intervention on the construction site.|$|E

40|$|Dobrogea {{province}} {{is composed}} by Constanta and <b>Tulcea</b> <b>counties,</b> {{situated in the}} South-eastern part of Romania, and it is {{known as one of}} the driest parts of Romania. The yearly amount of precipitations is no more than 400 - 450 mm. The yearly average temperature is around 10. 5 oC; the soils are of good quality but the main factor limiting the crops is, in this case, the lack of the water. During 1949 and 1955, studies were carried out concerning the damages produced by drought and the influence of the forest plantations for protective purposes on crops. Consequently, there have been planted protective forests on a few thousand hectares in the southern part of Constanta county but which were insufficient in order to protect all the agricultural lands. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the rehabilitation of the irrigation systems in the near future in Dobrogea, several projects were made in order to set up protective forest plantations. These projects include 70 localities and there have already been planted protective forests in some of them. The width of these forests is 10 m, the planting scheme is 2 x 1 m, and the distance between them is variable, by the case. The locust tree is the used specie...|$|R

40|$|As {{regards to}} organic farming, organic farms {{have a lot}} of {{shortcomings}} in ensuring smooth organization of production due to climatic factors or crop sensitivity and action of pests and diseases, but especially to the high cost of inputs, reduced subsidies and difficulties in obtaining fair prices on the market. Understanding how the organizational structure of the business can compete to ensure efficiency at farm level is an important means to resolve these deficiencies. In this context, this paper aims to identify the characteristics of the organization of organic crop farms starting from an interview-based analysis of two large crop specialised farms in <b>Tulcea</b> and Calaraşi <b>Counties.</b> The information obtained through this method of investigation has been translated into a SWOT analysis and represented the basis for comparison with information gathered from other interviews from two organic farms in Scotland. The main conclusions we reached highlight two types of organization systems, one without integration and another with supply chain integration, very similar to the Scottish ones, but also showing a very obvious difference in the mentality of the farm owners; Romanians focusing on meeting the conditions for certification and maintenance of crops in organic, and the Scots at finding new markets...|$|R
40|$|According {{to climate}} data Dobrogea is the warmest and the driest region of Romania. Due to climate, the {{productive}} potential of soils is poorly capitalized; productions depend mostly of the precipitations regime. The phenomenon {{is known for}} a long time, but the first steps to combat drought took just in the mid twentieth century when there was planted windbreak forest in the area Comorova and Ciocarlia - Cobadin. In the 50 s of the twentieth century windbreak forest was planted on about 3, 800 hectares that protected an agricultural area of over 75, 000 ha. The latter these were cleared during 1962 - 1965, when work began planning for irrigation. In the period 1967 - 1989, were equipped more than 420 thousand hectares representing over 82 % of the arable land of the county of Constanta and close to 160 thousand ha - about 48 % of the arable land of the <b>county</b> <b>Tulcea.</b> Due to improper operation yields were much lower than those projected. After 1990, facilities were destroyed and abandoned, so that in the recent years have been irrigated between 10, 000 - 20, 000 ha, although meanwhile were performed numerous analyzes and studies of rehabilitation. The lack of a clear strategy in the field, lack of funding for rehabilitation and sometimes of the interest of farmers to irrigate - in years of abundant precipitation - lead to the conclusion of an uncertain future while irrigation in Dobrogea is the main factor that depends on achieving high and safe yields. ...|$|R
