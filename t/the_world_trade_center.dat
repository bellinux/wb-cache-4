5|$|The Civil Air Patrol conducts {{humanitarian}} service missions, {{usually in}} support of the Red Cross.

5|$|The complex {{initially}} {{failed to}} attract the expected clientele. During the early years, various governmental organizations became key tenants of <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center,</b> such as the State of New York. In the 1980s, the city's perilous financial condition eased, after which {{an increasing number of}} private companies—mostly financial firms related to Wall Street—became tenants. During the 1990s, approximately 500 companies had offices in the complex, including financial companies such as Morgan Stanley, Aon Corporation, and Salomon Brothers. The basement concourse of <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> included The Mall at <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center,</b> and a PATH station. The North Tower became the main corporate headquarters of Cantor Fitzgerald, and it also became the headquarters of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> and nearby infrastructure caused serious {{damage to the}} economy of Lower Manhattan and {{had a significant effect}} on global markets, resulting in the closing of Wall Street until September 17 and the civilian airspace in the U.S. and Canada until September 13. Many closings, evacuations, and cancellations followed, out of respect or fear of further attacks. Cleanup of <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> site was completed in May 2002, and the Pentagon was repaired within a year. On November 18, 2006, construction of One World Trade Center began at <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> site. The building was officially opened on November 3, 2014. Numerous memorials have been constructed, including the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City, the Pentagon Memorial in Arlington County, Virginia, and the Flight 93 National Memorial in a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{destruction}} of the original World Trade Center, there was debate regarding the future of <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> site. There were proposals for its reconstruction almost immediately, and by 2002, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation had organized a competition to determine how to use the site. The proposals were part of a larger plan to memorialize the September 11 attacks and rebuild the complex. When the public rejected the first round of designs, a second, more open competition took place in December 2002, in which a design by Daniel Libeskind was selected as the winner. This design underwent many revisions, mainly because of disagreements with developer Larry Silverstein, who held the lease to <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> site at that time.|$|E
