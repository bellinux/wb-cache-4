500|$|Jackson herself would {{comment on}} the album's legacy on her 2015 album Unbreakable. In the song [...] "Shoulda Known Better", she {{reflects}} on her optimistic wish that Rhythm Nation 1814 could have profoundly changed the world, noting that there are many, deeper issues to fix and that broad strokes aren't enough. The chorus includes the line, [...] "Cause I don't want my face to be / That poster child for being naive"; and Rhythm Nations title {{is referred to as}} [...] "an epiphany", with Jackson mentioning that [...] "next time, I'll know better." [...] Album co-producer Jimmy Jam told the BBC: [...] "When you're young, you feel like: 'I can change the world! I'm going to lead the revolution!' And <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> 25 years later and you go: 'OK, I should have known better. The same problems still exist but there's a different way to go about tackling it. It still involves mobilising people, but I can't do it by myself.' It's just a wiser, more mature look at the reality of trying to make a positive change, a social change." ...|$|E
500|$|One direct death {{occurred}} in North Carolina; {{a young girl}} was killed when a tree fell on her Currituck County home. Throughout eastern portions of the state, trees and powerlines were downed, and {{there were reports of}} structural damage. Numerous docks, piers and bulkheads were either damaged or destroyed, including the Iron Steamer and Indian Beach piers, which both lost large sections to the strong wind and surf. Due to the winds, the Brunswick Community Hospital lost about [...] of roof and an air conditioner. The storm left about 500,000 people in the state without electric power. In some areas, vegetative and structural debris accumulated in piles several feet deep; it is reported that thick underbrush prevented the debris from traveling further inland. Wilmington [...] "turned into a disaster zone", with flooded highways, and downed trees lying across roadways. Crop, particularly tobacco, damage was extensive. According to then-governor Jim Hunt, [...] "You fly along and don't see much damage to the beach houses, and it's easy to think we didn't have much damage. But <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at the tobacco in fields and you know the damage has been extensive." [...] The crop losses accounted for much of the overall damage. Forty-seven of those who failed to evacuate in time sought shelter in the Bald Head Island lighthouse as the worst of the storm bore down. Despite the effects, Bonnie's impact was actually less than originally predicted. Overall, property damage in the state is estimated at $240million (1998 USD), with significantly higher crop damages.|$|E

2500|$|There is no human-rights {{organization}} or anti-corruption group in Equatorial Guinea. The human-rights group EG Justice, {{which focuses on}} such issues in the country, is based abroad. Its executive director, Tutu Alicante, has lived in U.S. exile since age 19 and describes his country has having two realities. [...] "It has the highest GDP per capita but also the widest {{gap between rich and}} poor people." [...] Despite being [...] "on paper the richest country on the continent on a per capita basis, on a par with many European nations," [...] he told The Guardian in 2014, Equatorial Guinea has [...] "one of the highest income and standard of living disparities....The income per capita is one which should allow people to have the same access to healthcare etc. as most European nations. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at the rates of access to water, access to adequate healthcare, access to education, infant mortality, maternal mortality, and you see that we are basically where the DRC is, where Haiti is. The gap between the income and the access to basic needs and rights is astronomical." [...] The reason for the absence of human-rights or anti-corruption groups, he has explained, is that the country is small, and any institution, such as a church, [...] "that the government perceives as sufficiently powerful is immediately co-opted" [...] or [...] "completely undermined." [...] Also, there are no labor unions, and any meeting of over five people requires a government permit.|$|E
2500|$|The {{story was}} nearly {{finished}} on the whiteboards when Chibnall began writing the script. After about two weeks, Chibnall had {{a draft of}} the first few episodes. Ellie Miller was a lesbian in the first draft of the script, and there was no Joe Miller. But this didn't work well narratively, so Chibnall changed the character to a married heterosexual. But he had not yet settled on a killer. [...] "Often as a writer, you get your first draft out, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> and think, 'Now, what have I got here'," [...] Chibnall {{said in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly. [...] "You're really just throwing mud at the wall and then going, 'Oh, there's a pattern there.' [...] " [...] Chibnall knew, however, that the killer had to be someone close to Ellie. About two weeks later, Chibnall woke one morning and realised the murderer should be Joe Miller, DS Ellie Miller's husband. [...] "t was the lightbulb moment above my head—which you never get as a writer, frankly. I've never had it before, probably won't ever have it again. I was, like, 'Ohmygod, it's Joe. It can't be anyone else.' [...] " [...] By making Joe the killer, Chibnall focused the series more closely on Ellie Miller, and improved the narrative structure so that it became about two families (the Millers and the Latimers). He then redrafted the first script and re-plotted and re-outlined the series. The killer's identity was [...] "embedded" [...] (as Chibnall described it) into the script before he brought the project to ITV. However, Chibnall kept the script loose enough that he could choose another character as the murderer, in case his preferred solution leaked to the press during shooting.|$|E

In the TV documentary The Making of Superman: The Movie, Brando explained: [...] If you don't know what the words are but you have a general idea of what they are, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at the cue card and it gives you the feeling to the viewer, hopefully, that the person is really searching for what he is going to say—that he doesn't know what to say.|$|E

I'm not gonna do what everybody around me is doing —so my direction was to be consciously different." [...] About his own genre, Biddines has stated that [...] "I probably do like 25 percent R&B 'cause it's just so you get a little taste, and not so much that I'm overdoing it 'cause I'm still primarily in the rap category.

5000|$|The word type may be {{incorrectly}} {{used instead}} of style to refer to an identifiable 'style of appearance' or 'working style characteristic' of a particular kennel or [...] "dogs of a well established line" [...] This terminology is incorrect. The word type in reference to a dog refers specifically to the description of what defines that breed and what makes that breed of dog different from every other breed, as {{can be found in}} that breed's written Standard. When comparing dogs of the same breed, you look at type first and foremost, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> for different styles of dogs within that breed. The term style refers to characteristics that are different in each dog that already has breed type. There can be a vast variety of styles existing in each breed of dog. These characteristics develop from a breeder's desire to create a distinct 'look' (or style) within their line. Breeders create their own style within their line, being careful not to stray from breed type.|$|E
5000|$|Harman became {{convinced}} that Western culture was facing a spiritual and moral crisis stemming from the ravages of industrialism and its economic logic, which he came to call the [...] "World Macroproblem". As Harman saw it, [...] "If {{you look at the}} assumptions underlying our economic system - especially the ones regarding the prerogatives of ownership - and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at the goals we humans have about how we want to live our lives, there is no compatibility. The assumptions can never lead to the goals." [...] In his view, this crisis that called for development of both an [...] "ecological ethic" [...] and a [...] "self-realization ethic". In short, society needed to transform its institutions to support the personal development of individual human beings within an environment of limited resources. Because Harman considered humans {{an integral part of the}} natural world, he saw individual self-realization and environmental sustainability as synergistic rather than contradictory paths forward. Harman also recognized the large (and often problematic) role that unconscious processes play in human culture and foresaw that work was needed to better understand how such processes might be harnessed in positive ways.|$|E
