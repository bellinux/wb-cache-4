5|$|Burkard von Müllenheim-Rechberg saw Lindemann for {{the last}} time at around 08:00 on the command bridge just prior to the final battle. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg {{described}} the normally intelligent, humorous and optimistic Lindemann now as pessimistic and withdrawn. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him and was ignored, and later wondered whether this was due to combat fatigue or whether the disagreements with Lütjens had worn him down.|$|E
25|$|Dillinger {{reportedly}} became despondent after Billie was arrested. The other {{gang members}} <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{him out of}} rescuing her, but Van Meter knew where they could find bulletproof vests. That Friday morning, late at night, Dillinger and Van Meter took Warsaw, Indiana police officer Judd Pittenger hostage. They marched him at gunpoint to the police station, where they stole several more guns and bulletproof vests. After separating, Dillinger picked up Hamilton, who was recovering from the Mason City robbery. The two then traveled to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where they visited Hamilton's sister Anna Steve.|$|E
500|$|Sutcliffe {{was fascinated}} by the trio, but {{especially}} Kirchherr, and thought they looked like [...] "real bohemians". Bill Harry later said that when Kirchherr walked in, every head would immediately turn her way, and that she always captivated the whole room. Sutcliffe wrote to a friend that he could hardly take his eyes off her and had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Kirchherr during the next break, but she had already left the club. Sutcliffe managed to meet them eventually, and learned that all three had attended the Meisterschule, which was the same type of art college that Lennon and Sutcliffe had attended in Liverpool. (Note: Meisterschule für Mode, Textil, Grafik und Werbung , although it is now called the University of Applied Sciences).|$|E

500|$|The first paranormal events {{reportedly}} {{occurred in}} about 1863, since a few locals later remembered having heard unexplained footsteps within {{the house at}} about that time. On 28 July 1900, four daughters of the rector, Henry Dawson Ellis Bull, saw {{what they thought was}} the ghost of a nun at twilight, about [...] from the house; they <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> it, but it disappeared as they got closer. The local organist, Ernest Ambrose later said that the family at the rectory were [...] "very convinced that they had seen an apparition on several occasions". Various people claimed to have witnessed a variety of puzzling incidents, such as a phantom coach driven by two headless horsemen, during the next four decades. Bull died in 1892 and his son, the Reverend Henry ("Harry") Foyster Bull, took over the living.|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr, Klaus Voormann, and Jürgen Vollmer were early {{fans of the}} Beatles {{after they}} heard the group play in the Kaiserkeller. Kirchherr, Voormann's girlfriend, was {{initially}} horrified {{at the idea of}} spending any time in such a sordid district, but Voormann, after watching the Beatles several times without her, eventually persuaded her to come too. After having previously only listened to Trad jazz, the Platters, and Nat King Cole, the Rock n' Roll that the Beatles played was totally new to them. The three friends visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night, arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage. Kirchherr, then 22 years old, later said: [...] "It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I wanted was to be with them and to know them." [...] Sutcliffe was fascinated by Kirchherr, and Harry later wrote that when Kirchherr walked in, every head would immediately turn her way. Sutcliffe wrote to a friend that he could hardly take his eyes off her when she had first walked into the club, and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her during the next break, but she had already left.|$|E
500|$|At {{the motel}} room, Selena and Saldívar began arguing. Motel guests complained about loud noises coming from Saldívar's room. They said they heard two women arguing about {{business}} matters. Selena told Saldívar {{she could no}} longer be trusted, and demanded Saldívar return her financial papers. Selena then dumped Saldívar's satchel containing bank statements onto the bed and saw the gun. At 11:48a.m. (CST), Saldívar pointed it at Selena. As Selena tried to flee, Saldívar shot her once on the lower right shoulder, severing an artery and causing a massive loss of blood. Trinidad Espinoza, the hotel's maintenance man, reported hearing a [...] "loud bang", which he likened to a car engine misfiring. Selena was critically wounded; she ran towards the lobby, leaving a trail of blood [...] long. She was seen clutching her chest screaming, [...] "Help me! Help me! I've been shot!"; Saldívar was still chasing after her, pointing the gun at her, and calling her a [...] "bitch". According to Carlos Morales, who was waiting outside the motel, he heard screaming and saw Selena running towards him. She grabbed Morales and screamed, [...] "they'll shoot me again". Selena collapsed on the floor at 11:49a.m. (CST) as hotel general manager Barbara Schultz telephoned the emergency services. The singer identified Saldívar as her assailant and gave the number of the room where she had been shot. Shawna Vela and hotel sales manager Ruben DeLeon tried to stop the flow of blood. Selena's condition began to deteriorate rapidly as motel staff attended to her. Selena screamed at the staff, telling them, [...] "lock the door, she'll shoot me again". DeLeon <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Selena but noticed she was beginning to lose consciousness; he said she was moaning and moving less often. DeLeon noticed Selena's eyes had rolled back and that she went limp.|$|E

2500|$|A {{present perfect}} also exists (normally called pretérito perfeito composto), {{but it has}} a very {{restricted}} use, denoting an action or a series of actions which began in the past and are expected to continue into the future, but will stop soon. For instance, the meaning of [...] "Tenho tentado falar com ela" [...] may be closer to [...] "I have been trying to talk to her" [...] than to [...] "I have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her", in some contexts.|$|E

[...] Blagojevich had announced in 2006 that Quinn was not to be considered part of his administration.|$|E
2500|$|The {{present perfect}} has an {{iterative}} sense {{unique to the}} Galician-Portuguese language group. It denotes an action or a series of actions {{that began in the}} past and are expected to keep repeating in the future. For instance, the sentence Tenho tentado falar com ela would be translated to [...] "I have been trying to talk to her", not [...] "I have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her". On the other hand, the correct translation of the question [...] "Have you heard the latest news?" [...] is not *Tem ouvido a última notícia?, but Ouviu a última notícia?, since no repetition is implied.|$|E

2500|$|Until the 1980s, Dalits {{had little}} {{involvement}} in Bollywood or other film industries of India {{and the community}} were rarely depicted {{at the heart of}} storylines. Chirag Paswan (son of Dalit leader Ram Vilas Paswan) launched his career in Bollywood with his debut film Miley Naa Miley Hum in 2011. Despite political connections and the financial ability to struggle against ingrained prejudices, Chirag was not able to [...] "bag" [...] any other movie project in the following years. Chirag, in his early days, described Bollywood as his [...] "childhood dream", but eventually entered politics instead. When the media <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him about [...] "Caste in Bollywood", he refused to talk about the matter, and his silence speaks for itself. The first Bollywood film to portray a Dalit character in the leading role, although it was not acted by a Dalit, was [...] (2007). The continued use of caste based references to Dalit sub-castes in South Indian films (typecast and pigeonholed in their main socio-economic sub-group) angers many Dalit fans.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} month, Capp {{was charged}} in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, {{in connection with}} another alleged incident following his April 1 lecture at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. Capp was accused of propositioning a married woman in his hotel room. Although no sexual act was alleged to have resulted, the original charge included [...] "sodomy." [...] As part of a plea agreement, Capp pleaded guilty {{to the charge of}} [...] "attempted adultery" [...] (adultery was a felony in Wisconsin) and the other charges were dropped. Capp was fined $500 and court costs. In a December 1992 article for The New Yorker, Seymour Hersh reported that President Richard Nixon and Charles Colson had repeatedly discussed the Capp case in Oval Office recordings that had recently been made available by the National Archives. Nixon and Capp were on friendly terms, Hersh wrote, and Nixon and Colson had worked to find a way for Capp to run against Ted Kennedy for the U.S. Senate. [...] "Nixon was worried about the allegations, fearing that Capp's very close links to the White House would become embarrassingly public," [...] Hersh wrote. [...] "The White House tapes and documents show that he and Colson discussed the issue repeatedly, and that Colson eventually reassured the President by saying that he had, in essence, fixed the case. Specifically, the President was told that one of Colson's people had gone to Wisconsin and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the prosecutors." [...] Colson's efforts failed, however. The Eau Claire district attorney, a Republican, refused to dismiss the attempted adultery charge. In passing sentence in February 1972, the judge rejected the D.A.'s motion that Capp agree to undergo psychiatric treatment.|$|E
