5|$|Ochre is {{reported}} from some early MSA sites, for example at Kapthurin and Twin Rivers, and is common after c. 100 ka. Barham argues {{that even if}} some of this ochre was used in a symbolic, color-related role then this abstraction could not have worked without language. Ochre, he suggests, could be one proxy for <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> emergence of language.|$|E

Sasha, still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> three, gets confronted by BloodClan warriors, but is able to trick them into fear by telling them she is a Clan warrior out looking for revenge of Tigerstar's death, and the BloodClan cats end up pointing out the direction they saw the kits go.|$|E
5|$|Sound {{technicians}} {{spent the}} early part of the year <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> right sounds. Some, such as animal sounds like those of tigers and walruses, were bought. Human voices were also used. Fran Walsh contributed to the Nazgûl scream and David Farmer the Warg howls. Other sounds were unexpected: the fell beast's screech is taken from that of a donkey, and the mûmakils bellow comes from the beginning and end of a lion's roar. In addition, ADR was used for most of the dialogue.|$|E

5|$|Poohsticks is {{considered}} to be a sport of chance yet some players claim skill is involved. Some strategies involve the way in which the stick is held before it is dropped and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> fastest route in the river. Author Ben Schott outlined a throwing method as a winning strategy in his third book, Schott’s Sporting, Gaming and Idling Miscellany, but his method was dismissed as cheating by competition organisers. In any event, the turbulence around the bridge supports make the path of the stick very difficult to predict and may vary according to the season.|$|E

Particular effort, so far unsuccessful, has been put into <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> site of {{the second and third}} caisson locks at Combe Hay. In October 2006 a grant of £20,000 was obtained from the Heritage Lottery Fund, by the Somersetshire Coal Canal Society in association with Bath & North East Somerset Council and the Avon Industrial Buildings Trust to carry out a technical study on one of the locks and associated structures at Combe Hay. Many of the locks and associated workings are listed buildings.|$|E

5|$|Legends {{describing}} Cofresí as malevolent generally link him to supernatural elements {{acquired through}} witchcraft, mysticism or {{a deal with}} the Devil. This horror fiction emphasizes his ruthlessness while alive or his unwillingness to remain dead. Cofresí's ghost has a fiery aura or extraordinary powers of manifestation, defending the locations of his hidden treasure or roaming aimlessly. Cofresí has been vilified by merchants. Legends portraying him as benign figure are more prevalent near Cabo Rojo; in other areas of Puerto Rico, they focus on his treasure and depict him as a cutthroat. Most of the hidden-treasure stories have a moral counseling against greed; those <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> plunder are killed, dragged to Davy Jones' Locker or attacked by the ghost of Cofresí or a member of his crew. Rumors about the locations of hidden treasure flourish, with dozens of coves, beaches and buildings linked to pirates in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola.|$|E
5|$|The 19-year-old Geoff Emerick was {{promoted}} to replace Norman Smith as engineer on the first session for the Revolver album. This started at 8pm on 6 April 1966, in Studio Three at Abbey Road. Lennon told producer Martin {{that he wanted to}} sound like a hundred chanting Tibetan monks, which left Martin the difficult task of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> effect by using the basic equipment they had. The effect was achieved by using a Leslie speaker. When the concept was explained to Lennon, he inquired if the same effect could be achieved by hanging him upside down and spinning him around a microphone while he sang into it. Emerick made a connector to break into the electronic circuitry of the cabinet and then re-recorded the vocal as it came out of the revolving speaker.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} about a seaside town which was damaged by a cataclysm and consequently {{sunk into the}} depths of the earth. A town named Rogueport was later built at this site, with the fortunes of the lost kingdom fabled to exist behind the eponymous Thousand-Year Door, located in the ruins of the old town. Mario becomes involved when Princess Peach contacts him about a treasure map that she bought in Rogueport, but becomes part of a larger adventure after learning that Peach has gone missing. With the help of Goombella and Professor Frankly, Mario learns that the map can potentially reveal the location of the 7 legendary Crystal Stars, which are required to unlock the Thousand-Year Door. Under the assumption that Peach herself is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> Crystal Stars, he uses the map in an attempt to locate her.|$|E

5|$|The game then jumps {{five years}} forward. Nier {{and the others}} are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> parts to a key that they believe will help them locate the Shadowlord and Grimoire Noir. After {{defeating}} five Shades and assembling the key, the team go to defeat the Shadowlord. There, Devola and Popola, characters who have been guiding Nier on his quest, appear to try to stop them. They explain that over 1300 years prior, humanity faced extinction due to an incurable disease. In an attempt to survive, they separated their souls from their bodies using Grimoire Noir and Weiss. They created clones resistant to the disease, Replicants, and intended to recombine the souls, or Gestalts, with the Replicant bodies once it had died out; Devola and Popola were androids set to oversee the project. Over time, the Replicants had begun to form their own identities; while the Gestalts, or Shades, had grown aggressive to them.|$|E
