5|$|BART {{was one of}} {{the first}} U.S. systems of any size to be {{substantially}} automated. Routing and dispatching of trains, and adjustments for schedule recovery are controlled by a combination of computer and human supervision at BART's Operations Control Center (OCC) and headquarters at the Kaiser Center in Downtown Oakland. Station-to-station <b>train</b> <b>movement,</b> including speed control and maintenance of separation between successive trains, is entirely automatic under normal operation, the operator's routine responsibilities being issuing announcements, closing the doors after stations stops, and monitoring the track ahead for hazards. In unusual circumstances the operator controls the train manually at reduced speed.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the events}} are placed along {{the axis of}} <b>train</b> <b>movement,</b> their time {{coordinates}} become projected to different time coordinates in the moving train's inertial frame. Events which occurred at space coordinates {{in the direction of}} <b>train</b> <b>movement</b> (in the stationary frame), happen earlier than events at coordinates opposite to the direction of <b>train</b> <b>movement.</b> In the moving train's inertial frame, this means that lightning will strike the front of the train car before two observers align (face each other).|$|E

25|$|Local <b>train</b> <b>movement</b> {{came to a}} halt by 2:30p.m. due to the water-logging on the tracks. This caused {{traffic on}} roads to {{increase}} dramatically with water logging and submerging of certain low-lying pockets of the region, such as Dharavi and Bandra-Kurla Complex.|$|E

25|$|His {{solution}} was outlined in The Best Method of Disposing of Our Pauper and Vagrant Children (1859) which started the Orphan <b>Train</b> <b>movement.</b> The orphan trains eventually shipped an estimated 200,000 {{children from the}} urban centers of the East to the nation's rural regions. The children were generally indentured, rather than adopted, to families who took them in. As in times past, some children were raised {{as members of the}} family while others were used as farm laborers and household servants.|$|E
25|$|Einstein's {{version of}} the {{experiment}} presumed slightly different conditions, where a train moving past the standing observer is struck by two bolts of lightning simultaneously, but at different positions along the axis of <b>train</b> <b>movement</b> (back and front of the train car). In the inertial frame of the standing observer, there are three events which are spatially dislocated, but simultaneous: event of the standing observer facing the moving observer (i.e., {{the center of the}} train), event of lightning striking the front of the train car, and the event of lightning striking the back of the car.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} incident, WMATA General Manager John Catoe {{stated that the}} cause was not known but that [...] "the system is safe." [...] The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) began an investigation. WMATA and NTSB {{investigators}} considered several possible causes, which might include operator error, brake failure, fault in the computerized signal and operation system, {{or a combination of}} the three. During rush hour operation, <b>train</b> <b>movement</b> is typically controlled by a centralized computer system, and a separate decentralized system can automatically apply the brakes to prevent a collision. These systems had failed at least once in the past, and the NTSB subsequently identified incompatible specifications, from the maximum deceleration capability of the trains to the deceleration rates used in the wayside system design. [...] The train has a manual emergency brake, which can be applied by the driver {{in the event of an}} imminent collision, if the driver can see and identify the hazard with sufficient time to stop. Officials indicated that the manual brake was indeed engaged. It is possible that the brake system failed to perform as designed, or that the operator applied the brake too late. The lead car of the moving train was two months overdue for scheduled brake maintenance. In a press conference the evening of June 22, Catoe stated that the last car on the stopped train was a CAF 5000-Series car (car 5066), which entered service in 2001, and that the lead car on the moving train was a Rohr Industries 1000-Series car. WMATA later confirmed that all of the cars on the moving train were 1000-Series.|$|E

2500|$|On October 21, 1957, {{four years}} after North Shore {{sub-division}} passenger trains ended, a train from Washington, the last SIRT special, crossed the Arthur Kill Bridge, carrying Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip to the Staten Island Ferry from a meeting with President Eisenhower in Washington D.C. The special <b>train</b> <b>movement</b> was conducted with secrecy, and the tracks along the route were cleared for this occasion. The train traveled over B, Reading Company, and Lehigh Valley lines to get to Staten Island Junction and the SIRT. The train, along with a press train, ended their runs at a freight yard at Stapleton.|$|E
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of new coaches allowed for improvements in service on the Dover Plains Branch. The first peak through service since the 1970s was inaugurated in October 1991. At the same time, a Sunday night through train was added. The reduced travel times made the line more attractive to commuters. In 1994, Metro-North conducted a <b>train</b> <b>movement</b> analysis of service on the branch to determine whether trains would pass one another based on speeds and the condition of tracks. As a result, a new [...] passing siding was constructed at Wingdale, increasing service flexibility and allowing for increased service in 1996. Also around this time, 447 additional parking spaces were added to stations on the Branch. In 1996, four car length high-level platforms with heated shelters were built at Patterson, Pawling, Harlem Valley–Wingdale and Dover Plains, replacing low-level platforms that could only accommodate two cars. These platforms were made {{to be compliant with}} the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Travel times could be reduced further as it would take less time for passengers to exit and board the trains.|$|E

5000|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} {{was a combination of}} human error, a defective and inadequate signalling system and an inadequate track layout which could not cope with complex <b>train</b> <b>movements.</b> Spur lines had been built to connect the Liverpool to Preston railway line to the Wigan to [...] railway line, known as the Burscough Curves, this meant that more complicated <b>train</b> <b>movements</b> were being made between the two railway lines.|$|R
