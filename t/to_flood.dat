40|$|A {{socio-economic}} data set on China's historical flood losses {{for the period}} 1984 – 2012 was compiled to analyze the exposed population, economy, and crop area {{as well as the}} vulnerabilities of the population and economy <b>to</b> <b>floods.</b> The results revealed that the exposed population was approximately 126 persons km− 2 per year when taking China as a whole; in terms of the economy, potential losses due <b>to</b> <b>floods</b> were estimated <b>to</b> be approximately 1. 49 million CN¥ km− 2 and the crop area exposed <b>to</b> <b>floods</b> covered 153 million hm 2 per year. China's total exposure <b>to</b> <b>floods</b> significantly increased over the analysis period. The areas that showed the higher exposure were mainly located along the east coast. The population's vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>floods</b> showed a significantly increasing trend, however, the economic vulnerability showed a decreasing trend. The populations and economies that were most vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>floods</b> were in Hunan, Anhui, Chongqing, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces.

30|$|Form {{factor is}} used to {{forecast}} the flow intensity of a given basin (Horton 1945).

40|$|River cities {{require a}} {{management}} approach based on resilience <b>to</b> <b>floods</b> {{rather than on}} resistance. Resisting floods by means of levees, dams, and channelization neglects inherent uncertainties arising from human-nature couplings and fails to address the extreme events {{that are expected to}} increase with climate change, and is thereby not a reliable approach <b>to</b> long-term <b>flood</b> safety. By applying resilience theory to address system persistence through changes, I develop a theory on "urban resilience to floods" as an alternative framework for urban flood hazard management. Urban resilience <b>to</b> <b>floods</b> is defined as a city's capacity <b>to</b> tolerate <b>flooding</b> and <b>to</b> reorganize should physical damage and socioeconomic disruption occur, so as to prevent deaths and injuries and maintain current socioeconomic identity. It derives from living with periodic floods as learning opportunities to prepare the city for extreme ones. The theory of urban resilience <b>to</b> <b>floods</b> challenges the conventional wisdom that cities cannot live without flood control, which in effect erodes resilience. To operationalize the theory for planning practice, a surrogate measure - the percent floodable area - is developed for assessing urban resilience <b>to</b> <b>floods.</b> <b>To</b> enable natural floodplain functions to build urban resilience <b>to</b> <b>floods,</b> flood adaptation is advocated in order <b>to</b> replace <b>flood</b> control for mitigating flood hazards...|$|R

5|$|On 4 March 1907 Iéna {{was moved}} into dry dock No. 2 in the Missiessy Basin at Toulon to undergo {{maintenance}} of her hull {{as well as}} inspection of her rudder shaft. Eight days later, beginning at 1:35a.m. and continuing until 2:45, a series of explosions began in the port No. 5 100-millimetre magazine of Iéna which devastated the ship and the surrounding area. Because the ship was in a dry dock it was initially impossible <b>to</b> <b>flood</b> the magazines. The commanding officer of the battleship , which was moored nearby, fired a shell into {{the gate of the}} dry dock in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>flood</b> it, but the shell ricocheted without holing the gate. The dock was finally flooded when Ensign de Vaisseau Roux (who was killed shortly afterward by fragments from the ship) managed to open the sluice gates.

40|$|The flood is a {{well-known}} phenomenon in the Vietnamese Mekong River Delta (MRD). Although people have experienced the impact of floods for years, some adapt well, but others are vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>floods.</b> Resilience <b>to</b> <b>floods</b> is a useful concept to study the capacity of rural households to cope with, adapt to, and benefit from floods. Knowledge of the resilience of households <b>to</b> <b>floods</b> can help disaster risk managers to design policies for living with floods. Most researchers attempt to define the concept of resilience; very little research operationalizes it in the real context of "living with floods". We employ a subjective well-being approach to measure households' resilience <b>to</b> <b>floods.</b> Items that related to households' capacity to cope with, adapt to, and benefit from floods were developed using both a five-point Likert scale and dichotomous responses. A factor analysis using a standardized form of data was employed to identify underlying factors that explain different properties of households' resilience <b>to</b> <b>floods.</b> Three properties of households' resilience <b>to</b> <b>floods</b> were found: (1) households' confidence in securing food, income, health, and evacuation during floods and recovery after floods; (2) households' confidence in securing their homes not being affected by a large flood event such as the 2000 flood; (3) households' interests in learning and practicing new flood-based farming practices that are fully adapted <b>to</b> <b>floods</b> for improving household income during the flood season. The findings assist in designing adaptive measures to cope with future flooding in the MRD...|$|R
