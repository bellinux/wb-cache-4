25|$|Odd Blood {{was mostly}} crafted with {{engineer}} Steve Revitte in a secluded cabin studio. During the sessions, Yeasayer experimented with different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> and recording machines. Auxiliary musicians were hired {{to help with}} the process. The idea was to marry sonic experimentation with pop structures, while primary songwriters Chris Keating and Anand Wilder explored a variety of themes such as boxing, addiction, and paranoia. Odd Blood also contains several love songs. The album received largely positive reviews from critics. Praise centered on its cohesive merging of genres, especially the pop-influenced rhythms.|$|E
25|$|One major {{difference}} between Baroque music and the classical era that followed {{it is that the}} <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> used in Baroque ensembles were much less standardized. Whereas a classical era string quartet consists almost exclusively of two violins, a viola and a cello, a Baroque or Classical-era group accompanying a soloist or opera could include one of several different types of keyboard instruments (e.g., pipe organ, harpsichord, or clavichord), additional stringed chordal instruments (e.g., a lute) and an unspecified number of bass instruments performing the basso continuo, including bowed strings, woodwinds and brass instruments (e.g., a cello, contrabass, viol, bassoon, serpent, etc.).|$|E

25|$|Tamboo-bamboo bands {{consist of}} three {{different}} instruments (each cut from bamboo): boom, foulé, and cutter. The boom serves as the bass instrument, is usually about five feet long, and is played by stamping it on the ground. The foulé, a higher-pitched instrument, consists of two pieces of bamboo, each about a foot long, and is played by striking these pieces end to end. The cutter, the highest-pitched instrument in the ensemble, is made from a thinner piece of bamboo (of varying length) and is struck with a stick. These three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> combined to beat out rhythms that accompanied the chantwells and were a staple of carnival celebrations for many years. They were gradually rendered obsolete by the steel band.|$|E
25|$|The modal {{concepts}} in Persian folk music are directly linked {{with that of}} the classical music. However, improvisation plays a minor role as folk tunes are characterized by relatively clear-cut melodic and rhythmic properties. The function of each folk melody determines its mood. The varying aesthetic requirements of wedding songs, lullabies, love songs, harvest songs, dance pieces, etc., are met with transparent and appropriate simplicity. The majority of the classical instruments are too elaborate and difficult for the folk musicians. Instead, there are literally dozens of musical instruments of various sorts found among the rural people. In fact, each region of the country can boast instruments peculiar to itself. Three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments,</b> however, are common to all parts of the country. They are, a kind of shawm called Surnay (or Sorna ~ Zorna), the various types of Ney (flute), and the Dohol, a doubleheader drum.|$|E

500|$|The Wiggles {{have written}} new music each year since their inception; they sequestered {{themselves}} for a month each summer and wrote three albums' worth of original children's music based on simple concepts familiar to young children, and using several genres of music and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments.</b> Most of their songs were short and started with the chorus because they felt that young children needed to be presented with a song's topic in their first few lines. [...] They wrote songs individually at first, but eventually wrote as a group, often with John Field, trumpet player Dominic Lindsay, and Paddick. [...] Fatt, {{the only member of}} the original group without a degree in early childhood education, tended to focus on composing music. [...] Fatt told reporter Brian McElhiney, who called the group's songwriting process [...] "a collaborate affair", that they wrote repetitive pop songs or jingles, which were appealing to children. [...] Watkins reported that she was invited to write songs for their albums, even though she was primarily a dancer. [...] John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival, who appeared in a Wiggles video in 2002, told The New York Times that he was [...] "very impressed" [...] with the group's songwriting, especially with their drum sound.|$|E

Study design: Three hundred and seventy-six molars, {{with a total of}} 1114 root canals, extracted were instrumented by undergraduate students using ProTaper instruments according to the manufacturer´s recommendations. When fracture occurred, data were collected concerning the number <b>of</b> uses, <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>instrument,</b> level <b>of</b> fracture, angle and radius of curvature. ANOVA test were used to determine the influence <b>of</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> in the incidence <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> fracture.
