The <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> learning <b>maturity,</b> from novice to expert, is examined using both, quantitative and qualitative methodologies. The process of enhancing problem solving skills is examined qualitatively using discourse analysis, interviews and reviews of student's reflection journals. The categorization and analysis are done by mapping Piaget's definition of novice versus expert for cognitive activities, with SOLO taxonomy of learning for cognitive level. This is then mapped with problem solving cycles using the House of Quality (HOQ) approach for quantification...|$|R

5|$|Hirschman {{believed}} that Nurkse's balanced growth theory wasn't {{in fact a}} theory of growth.

Thus, there is no transformation. In reality, a dual economy will come into existence, where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist in one country. They will differ on levels of development, technology and demand patterns. This may create inequality in the country.|$|R

This {{is a report}} of a sixteen year old boy who presented with a malignant <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> a recurrent sebaceoma which was excised twice by Moh’s surgery. Excision was done with a free margin of 1 cm down to the parotid fascia. Reconstruction {{was performed on the}} same set by using cervicofascial flap extending down to the supra-clavicular area. The patient had an uneventful postoperative period apart from distal marginal necrosis of the flap, which healed nicely with conservative measures and daily dressing and was sent to our cancer centre to start his adjuvant radiotherapy. Previous literature stated that sebaceoma is a distinctive benign tumor. We have presented a case of an unusual malignant <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> a preauricular recurrent sebaceoma.
