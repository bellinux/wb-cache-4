40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{information}} retrieval applications rely on search behavior aggregated over many users. If aggregated data such as search query reformulations is not handled properly, it can allow users to be identified and their privacy compromised. Besides leveraging aggregate data, it is also common for applications {{to make use of}} user-specific behavior in order to provide a personalized experience for users. Unlike aggregate data, privacy is not an issue in individual personalization since users are the only consumers of their own data. The goal of this work is to explore the effects of personalization and privacy preservation methods on three information retrieval applications, namely search <b>task</b> <b>identification,</b> task-aware query recommendation, and searcher frustration detection. We pursue this goal by first introducing a novel framework called CrowdLogging for logging and aggregating data privately over a distributed set of users. We then describe several privacy mechanisms for sanitizing global data, including one novel mechanism based on differential privacy. We present a template for describing how local user data and global aggregate data are collected, processed, and used within an application, and apply this template to our three applications. We find that sanitizing feature vectors aggregated across users has a low impact on performance for classification applications (search <b>task</b> <b>identification</b> and searcher frustration detection). However, sanitizing free-text query reformulations is extremely detrimental to performance for the query recommendation application we consider. Personalization is useful to some degree in all the applications we explore when integrated with global information, achieving gains for search <b>task</b> <b>identification,</b> task-aware query recommendation, and searcher frustration detection. Finally we introduce an open source system called CrowdLogger that implements the CrowdLogging framework and also serves as a platform for conducting in-situ user studies of search behavior, prototyping and evaluating information retrieval applications, and collecting labeled data. ...|$|R

We also analyse the effect of <b>identification</b> <b>task</b> decisions on subsequent subjective reports. Results show that awareness ratings strongly predict accuracy for all scale types, although the type of awareness measure may influence the reported level of perceptual awareness. Surprisingly, the overall relationship between awareness ratings and performance was weaker when participants rated their awareness before providing identification responses. Furthermore, the Perceptual Awareness Scale was most exhaustive only when used after the <b>identification</b> <b>task,</b> whereas confidence ratings were most exhaustive when used before the <b>identification</b> <b>task.</b> We conclude that the type of subjective measure applied may influence the reports on visual awareness.

40|$|Managing work {{practices}} {{has become}} one of the key challenges facing virtual communities. This paper seeks to broaden the research on virtual communities by applying the theory of competency rallying (TCR) in a longitudinal manner to examine the impact of <b>task</b> <b>identification,</b> <b>task</b> assignment, task execution and task management on user interest in open source software (OSS) projects defined by popularity and communication. The aim of this paper is: (1) re-conceptualizing the concept of user interest and broadening our understanding of user interest by incorporating users' post-usage behaviors, (2) examining the effect of various tasks involved in an OSS project's key processes of defect-fixing and feature-enhancement on user interest. The current study found that project popularity is positively influenced by task assignment, task execution and task management. Additionally, user communication was found to be positively impacted by <b>task</b> <b>identification</b> and <b>task</b> execution. The data collected from 1178 OSS projects in a longitudinal manner (at 3 time points over a period of 16 months) confirmed the expectations from TCR and also demonstrated that over time the effects that development of competencies and managing short term cooperative work have on project success might increase, while the impact of identifying market needs and marshalling competencies may not significantly change.

40|$|Purpose: This {{research}} aims {{to identify}} product search tasks in online shopping {{and analyze the}} characteristics of consumer multi-tasking search sessions. Design/methodology/approach: The experimental dataset contains 8, 949 queries of 582 users from 3, 483 search sessions. A sequential comparison of the Jaccard similarity coefficient between two adjacent search queries and hierarchical clustering of queries is used to identify search tasks. Findings: (1) Users issued a similar number of queries (1. 43 to 1. 47) with similar lengths (7. 3 - 7. 6 characters) per task in mono-tasking and multi-tasking sessions, and (2) Users spent more time on average in sessions with more tasks, but spent less time for each task {{when the number of}} tasks increased in a session. Research limitations: The <b>task</b> <b>identification</b> method that relies only on query terms does not completely reflect the complex nature of consumer shopping behavior. Practical implications: These results provide an exploratory understanding of the relationships among multiple shopping tasks, and can be useful for product recommendation and shopping task prediction.

Through the information collection processes, the organization collects the relevant attributes of tasks to estimate the resources necessary for their execution.

Demonstrations of subliminal priming rely on a dual task design: A target <b>identification</b> <b>task</b> in which the priming effect is measured, and a prime <b>identification</b> <b>task</b> in which visibility of the primes is assessed. The validity of this design relies on the critical assumption that the estimates of prime visibility accurately reflect prime visibility in the target <b>identification</b> <b>task.</b> Here it is suggested that the difference in difficulty between the two tasks results in a violation of this assumption. Specifically, the target <b>identification</b> <b>task</b> is easy while the prime <b>identification</b> <b>task</b> is extremely difficult. It is shown that decreasing the overall difficulty of the prime <b>identification</b> <b>task</b> results in increased prime identifiably. It is also shown that primes which are unable to be identified in a task which accurately estimates prime identifiably do not elicit a priming effect. Hence, we conclude that demonstrations of subliminal priming are an artifact of this violation rather than a real phenomenon...|$|R

The question that I want to ask is whether it is possible to automate the processes involved in data science ? I also want to answer that question in the course of our ERC AdG project SYNTH on “Synthesising Inductive Data Models”. To start the discussion on this topic, it is useful to look at the famous knowledge discovery cycle, where one typically starts from raw data, select and pre-process the data, identify the data mining task, use the right data mining algorithms, and then interpret the results and possibly iterate. It turns out that most of the existing approaches to automating this process, such as the automated statistician and meta-learning, algorithm portfolio and configuration approaches assume the learning task is known and we only need to identify the right algorithm and parameters to find the optimal task. It is well-known in the data mining community that this step takes typically only about 20 % of the time, while the pre- processing and <b>task</b> <b>identification</b> take 80 % of the time. The question that I am interested in is {{what we can do to}} automate the pre-processing and <b>task</b> <b>identification</b> aspects, particularly for non-experts in data science.
