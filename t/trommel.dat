25|$|In an {{alternative}} bulk system, a hopper conveys material for shredding into an unsophisticated mechanical separator, with screening and granulating machines to separate constituent metal and plastic fractions, which are sold to smelters or plastics recyclers. Such recycling machinery is enclosed and employs a dust collection system. Some of the emissions are caught by scrubbers and screens. Magnets, eddy currents, and <b>Trommel</b> screens are employed to separate glass, plastic, and ferrous and nonferrous metals, which {{can then be}} further separated at a smelter.|$|E

25|$|Heavy {{machinery}} {{is used in}} mining {{to explore}} and develop sites, to remove and stockpile overburden, to break and remove rocks of various hardness and toughness, to process the ore, and to carry out reclamation projects after the mine is closed. Bulldozers, drills, explosives and trucks are all necessary for excavating the land. In the case of placer mining, unconsolidated gravel, or alluvium, is fed into machinery consisting of a hopper and a shaking screen or <b>trommel</b> which frees the desired minerals from the waste gravel. The minerals are then concentrated using sluices or jigs.|$|E
2500|$|Zoya's {{favorite}} subject in school was literature. Her teachers noted her essays for {{deep understanding of}} the subject and for imagery. She read far beyond the curriculum. The list of authors she read included Leo Tolstoy, Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov, Karamzin, Vasily Zhukovsky, Byron, Molière, Miguel Cervantes, Charles Dickens, Wolfgang Goethe, and William Shakespeare. Zoya kept a notebook where she recorded her thoughts about the books she read. Such as: [...] "In Shakespeare's tragedies {{the death of a}} hero is always accompanied by a triumph of a high moral cause." [...] She liked Beethoven's Egmont and often sang Klärchen's song [...] "Die <b>Trommel</b> gerühret." [...] Her favorite music was Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5. Her striving for high ideals led to misunderstandings with her classmates. On the eve of 1939 the girls wrote each other notes with New Year wishes. Zoya received the following note [...] "Zoya, don't judge people so strict. Don't take everything so close to heart. Know that most people are egoist, flatterers, are insincere and you can't depend on them. You should leave their words without attention. Such is my New Year wish." [...] After reading the note Zoya said [...] "If one thinks of people like that, then what has one to live for?" ...|$|E
60|$|When Lord Roberts {{had swept}} past {{to the north}} he had brushed aside the flower of the Orange Free State army, who {{occupied}} the considerable quadrilateral which is formed by the north-east of that State. The function of Rundle's 8th Division and of Brabant's Colonial Division was to separate the sheep from the goats by preventing the fighting burghers from coming south and disturbing those districts which had been settled. For this purpose Rundle formed a long line which {{should serve as a}} cordon. Moving up through <b>Trommel</b> and Clocolan, Ficksburg was occupied on May 25th by the Colonial Division, while Rundle seized Senekal, forty miles to the north-west. A small force of forty Yeomanry, who entered the town some time in advance of the main body, was suddenly attacked by the Boers, and the gallant Dalbiac, famous rider and sportsman, was killed, with four of his men. He was a victim, as so many have been in this campaign, to his own proud disregard of danger.|$|E
50|$|Larger {{commercial}} {{placer mining}} operations employ screening plants, or <b>trommels,</b> {{to remove the}} larger alluvial materials such as boulders and gravel, before concentrating the remainder in a sluice box or jig plant. These operations typically include diesel powered, earth moving equipment, including excavators, bulldozers, wheel loaders, and rock trucks.|$|R

2500|$|Although {{individual}} grains or pebbles of alluvial tin {{collected by}} streaming were often of high purity {{it was usually}} still necessary to remove the unwanted [...] "gangue" [...] material before the ore could be smelted. The need for this process, which was known as dressing the ore, increased as the poorer sources of lode tin were exploited. The principle of concentration was a refined version of that used by the early tin-streamers: it depended on the large difference in specific gravity between the wanted tin ore and the gangue. Many different mechanical methods were used, including rectangular and circular buddles, Wilfley tables and revolving slime tables, kieves, <b>trommels,</b> and even magnetic separation.|$|R
50|$|Roller screens are {{preferred}} to <b>trommel</b> screens when the feed rate required is high. They also cause less noise than <b>trommel</b> screens and require less head room. Viscous and sticky materials {{are easier to}} be separated using a roller screen than with a <b>trommel</b> screen.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the main}} {{governing}} equations for a <b>trommel</b> screen include the screening rate, screening efficiency and residence time of particles in the screen. These equations could be applied in the rough calculation done in initial phases of a design process. However, design is largely based on heuristics. Therefore, design rules are often used {{in place of the}} governing equations in the design of a <b>trommel</b> screen. When designing a <b>trommel</b> screen, the main factors affecting the screening efficiency and production rate are the rotational velocity of the drum, mass flow rate of feed particles, size of the drum, and inclination of <b>trommel</b> screen. Depending on desired application of <b>trommel</b> screen, a balance has to be made between the screening efficiency and production rate.|$|E
5000|$|An {{excavator}} or {{front end}} loader uncovers the landfilled materials and places them on a moving floor conveyor belt {{to be taken to}} the sorting machinery. A <b>trommel</b> is used to separate materials by size. First, a large <b>trommel</b> separates materials like appliances and fabrics. A smaller <b>trommel</b> then allows the biodegraded soil fraction to pass through leaving non-biodegradable, recyclable materials on the screen to be collected.|$|E
50|$|The main {{north and}} south walls of the mill {{building}} are buttressed, {{and it is not}} known whether these buttresses were part of the original design, or whether they were added after the collapse mentioned above. Certainly they were needed, given the design of the building which only had solid walls on 3 sides - the western wall was timbered, and clad in corrugated iron. Apart from the cavernous main mill building, which housed the main equipment, i.e. stone-breaker, Cornish rolls, <b>trommels</b> and jigs machinery, the northern extension held Wilfley tables, and the most southerly part was the turbine room. The office was a separate building to the north, half-way to the road bridge.|$|R

25|$|In the 1890s, Captain Borlase's {{efforts to}} save labour costs {{involved}} {{improvements to the}} mill, making it a continuous process. Ore from the mine was separated into three size fractions before crushing the larger ones. The crushed ore was passed through cylindrical <b>trommels</b> so that fractions of different sizes could be sent to separate jigs. Vibrating tables replaced some of the round buddles to treat fine material, and an {{effort was made to}} recover some of the zinc blende in the ore, but this seems not to have been successful. Water provided the motive power in the mill. Smelting and refining remained labour-intensive and costly. In 1903 {{the decision was made to}} stop separating the silver and to sell argentiferous lead to a smelting company. This created an overall saving of 14shillings per ton of lead sold, roughly £750 per year. With labour shortages during World WarI and reduced ore production, it was decided to cease smelting altogether in 1917 and sell the lead concentrates.|$|R
50|$|Finer {{particle}} sizes (>40 µm) {{are able}} to be separated with the gyratory separator than with a <b>trommel</b> screen. The size of the gyratory screen separator can be adjusted through removable trays, whereas the <b>trommel</b> screen is usually fixed. Gyratory separators can also separate dry and wet materials like <b>trommel</b> screens. However, {{it is common for}} the gyratory separators to separate either dry or wet materials only. This is because there are different parameters for the gyratory screen to have the best separation efficiency. Therefore, two separators would be required for the separation of dry and wet materials, while one <b>trommel</b> screen {{would be able to do}} the same job.|$|E

40|$|Auto {{shredder}} residue or “ASR ” is a heterogeneous mixture of largely non-metallic materials {{resulting from the}} shredding of auto bodies, appliances, and other scrap metal materials. An auto shredder is a large, electric-powered hammermill that pulverizes metal into fist-sized pieces which are then sorted by different “downstream ” metal separation processes including magnets, <b>trommels,</b> screens, optical scanners, eddy currents, {{and other types of}} proprietary process equipment. ASR is the material that remains after ferrous and nonferrous metals have been separated and removed from the various streams comprising the output of the shredder. Shredder output is known as “aggregate ” in the industry and is an intermediate process material that contains significant amounts of valuable ferrous and nonferrous metal that is separated and sold as commodities. In contrast, ASR consists primarily of foam, fabric, plastics, rubber, tires, glass, wood, and debris materials, along with minute amounts of remaining metallic material that is too small to be economically separated and removed from the aggregate. Following completion of processing for metals separation and removal, ASR is sent to an in-line treatment system (described below) where it is treated prior to transport off-site, primarily for use as alternative daily landfill cover. Treated material (“TASR”) is subject to a final magnetic scree...|$|R
