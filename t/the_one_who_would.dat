5|$|Republican campaigns, {{the core}} of Bonaparte's reserve was 30,000 men, mostly from the Batavian Republic, who had been used under Guillaume Marie Anne Brune to crush the {{rebellion}} in the Vendée. Additional veteran troops came from {{the remains of the}} former Army of England. The new mililary doctrine emphasised the offensive, mobility and the bayonet, over linear firepower. In front of the Austrian army were stationed, in and to the south of Marengo, the corps of Victor (Jacques-Antoine de Chambarlhac de Laubespin and Gaspard Amédée Gardanne's divisions), supported on the left by François Étienne de Kellermann's cavalry and, further to the northeast, by the corps of Lannes (François Watrin's division, Mainoni's brigade) together with two cavalry brigades.

25|$|Of all {{the architects}} {{associated}} with Blacket, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> become most famous was John Horbury Hunt, {{who worked with}} him from 1863 to 1868. It was at this time, that Blacket's architecture developed bolder forms, based upon Norman, Transitional and Early French Gothic architecture, rather than the more refined Gothic. This is particularly noticeable in the presence of simple round windows divided by four circles of tracery in the gables of several churches of this time. Blacket permitted his staff to enter competitions, and it was while at Blacket's office that Horbury Hunt won the commission for Newcastle Cathedral, to be executed in his preferred material of brick. The brick church at Tumut, consecrated in 1873, is ascribed to Blacket, but appears to owe much to Hunt. Hunt, who lived most of his early life in North America, had previously worked under Edward Clarke Cabot. One of the innovations that he introduced to Australian architecture while working for Blacket was the saw-tooth roof for industrial building, which was employed at Mort's Woolstore. Hunt appears to have been influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, particularly Philip Webb, and ultimately he created buildings of great originality such as the Anglican Cathedrals of Grafton and Armidale.|$|E
25|$|Hugo Gressmann {{has found}} 22 similar stories in world {{folklore}} and literature, especially in India {{and the far}} east. One Indian version is a Jataka story dealing with Buddha {{in one of his}} previous incarnations as the sage Mahosadha, who arbitrates between a mother and a Yakshini who is {{in the shape of a}} woman, who kidnapped the mother's baby and claimed he was hers. The sage announced a tug war: He drew a line on the ground and asked the two to stand on opposite sides of the line, one holding his feet and the other his hands – <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> pull the baby's whole body beyond the line would get him. The mother, seeing how the baby suffers, released him and let the Yakshini take him, weeping. When the sage saw that, he turned the baby back to the hands of the true mother, exposed the identity of the Yakshini and expelled her. In other Indian versions the two women are widows of one husband. Another version appears in the Chinese drama The Chalk Circle (in this version the judge draws a circle on the ground), which has been widespread all over the world and many versions and reworkings were made after it, among them The Caucasian Chalk Circle, a play by Bertolt Brecht.|$|E

Many viewers of the commercial, including Speedway Motorsports, Inc. owned Lowe's Motor Speedway president Jerry Gappens, expressed their concern as it appeared the episode was parodying an actual incident that happened during a speedway race at Lowe's Motor Speedway in May 1999, in Charlotte, North Carolina, when flying debris in a crash killed three spectators. Gappens said that doing a parody of that was [...] "a real insensitive thing to do, pretty irresponsible. Obviously what might appear funny in L.A. or New York isn't funny here in Charlotte." [...] Lowe's Motor Speedway announced to WSOC-TV's Channel 9 Eyewitness News on February7,2000 that they were thinking of placing a complaint to the Fox Broadcasting Company.

500|$|Chrissie left Den but was {{eventually}} convinced {{to give their}} marriage another try. Oberman revealed in the Daily Mail that she drew on a famous real-life model to reconcile the dichotomous behaviour of a strong woman taking back her cheating husband: [...] "I based Chrissie on Hillary: an intelligent, attractive woman who was publicly humiliated. People ask why she stays with that awful man. A lot of strong women are like that." [...] She also saw {{the ebb and flow}} of Den and Chrissie's marriage as a reflection of the mental gameplaying that was so prominent in their characterisations: [...] "I think there's a challenge in it, and I think she would like to be <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> ultimately tame him." [...] As Den's equal, Chrissie was intended to be a challenge to his propensity for intellectual games, having already outwitted the show's prior , Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Den had seen little threat in his first wife's aptitude, but considered Chrissie to be [...] "as sharp as they come". Indeed, Den's extra-marital dalliances were used by writers to showcase and highlight Chrissie's [...] "strong-willed persona".

Well you don't have a clue what's going to happen if she ever finds out! The best thing you can do is keep your mouth shut."

2500|$|The Scerimans were reputedly, amongst all Catholic Armenians in New Julfa, {{both the}} most {{influential}} {{as well as the}} richest. The first patriarch of the family, Agha Morad, was from Jugha ("Old Julfa"). Nothing is known about his life in Old Julfa, or about his career in New Julfa. One of his sons, Shahriman, carried on the line. The family's name is derived from his name. It was then under Shahriman's son, named Sarhat (also referred to as Khvajeh Sarhat), in the mid-17th century, that the family's wealth, prestige, and influence grew. A key aspect that differs the Scerimans from other Armenian merchants from Julfa, was that the Scerimans by origin and specialisation focused primaly on diamonds and gems, whereas most other Armenians from the aforementioned place specialized in the trade of silk with Europe. In regard to them as a family firm, the Scerimans followed the principle of the oldest man being the one in charge of the business and ventures, as well as being <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> a [...] "patriarchial and managerial authority" [...] over his siblings and their own families in question.

The latter makes a terrified return home, and the monarch subsequently plays the same trick on his second son, with much the same result. Without revealing his ruse, the parent makes known his disappointment, which prompts the junior to burst out into tears and run out into the palace's garden. He is visited there by an old woman beggar, who suggests that she has the powers of a fortune teller and receives his alms. The woman then predicts that the youngest prince will become a glorious emperor, urges him to attempt his uncle's quest, but warns him that he should use only items his father had used as a groom: ragged clothes, rusty weapons and an old stallion. She subsequently disappears from the prince's sight, rising to the skies.|$|E
