5000|$|Weapons in HoL can be anything; a {{rolled-up}} newspaper, broken bottle, Enemy-B-GoneTM, Kitty Kitty Bang BangsTM or whatever. Every weapon has an Anguish Value and a <b>Damage</b> <b>Number.</b> Anguish Values {{are rated}} from 1 (staple in a finger) to 20 (Unprotected Re-entry into the Atmosphere). The higher the number, {{the more the}} weapon [...] "hurts" [...] the character, and is strictly for the enjoyment of role-playing. <b>Damage</b> <b>Numbers</b> have no upper limit.|$|R
50|$|Everyone in HoL has 20 Wound Levels {{that start}} at zero and {{increase}} {{according to how}} much damage they have taken. To figure out damage, the character's Meat Stat + Armor Value (if any) is subtracted from the weapon's Anguish Value. Once that number is determined the character finds the <b>number</b> on a <b>Damage</b> Multiplier Chart and rolls a d6 to determine {{the intensity of the}} multiplier of the weapon's <b>Damage</b> <b>Number.</b> The weapon's <b>Damage</b> <b>Number</b> is then multiplied that many times (from x1 to x5) and added to the character's current Wound Level.|$|R
50|$|Populations of the pallid-winged {{grasshopper}} occasionally irrupt to <b>damaging</b> <b>numbers.</b> Between 1952 and 1980, {{there were}} six outbreaks in Arizona, only one of which lasted more than one year.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the target inertia term of rigid kinetic energy {{projectiles}} (KEP’s) penetration resistance is investigated using nonlinear dynamic code LS-DYNA and four constitutive models. It is found that the <b>damage</b> <b>number</b> of target {{can be used to}} measure the influence of the inertia term. The smaller the <b>damage</b> <b>number</b> is, the less influence the inertia term has. The less dependent the resistance has on projectile velocity, the more accurate it is to treat the resistance as a constant. For the ogive-nose projectile with CRH of 3, when the target is aluminum, steel, or other metals, the threshold velocity for the constant resistance is at least 1258 [*]m/s; when the target is concrete, rock, or other brittle materials, if the velocity of the projectile is greater than 400 [*]m/s or so, the <b>damage</b> <b>number</b> would be very large, and the penetration resistance would clearly depend on the projectile’s velocity. The higher the elastic wave velocity is, the more penetration process is affected by the impact face...|$|R
5000|$|Karnak {{appears as}} one of the 12 unique Heroclix figures {{included}} in the Marvel Supernova set. His collectors number is #088. He is appropriately equipped with many clicks of exploit weakness and has powerful attack and <b>damage</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rocket Launcher: This gun is slow firing {{but does}} heavy damage and does splash damage. Can be {{upgraded}} in <b>damage,</b> <b>number</b> of warheads, rate of fire, zoom and reload. It fires self-propelled warheads. Price: 450 Credits. Firing Style: Slow heavy hits.|$|R
25|$|On June 14, 1979, {{the number}} 5 and 6 tires on an Air France Concorde blew out during takeoff. Shrapnel thrown from the tires and rims <b>damaged</b> <b>number</b> 2 engine, {{punctured}} three fuel tanks, severed several hydraulic lines and electrical wires, {{in addition to}} tearing a large hole {{on the top of}} the wing, over the wheel well area.|$|R
5000|$|... 13 June 1979: The number 5 and 6 tyres {{blew out}} during a takeoff from Washington Dulles International Airport. Fragments thrown from the tyres and rims <b>damaged</b> <b>number</b> 2 engine, {{punctured}} three fuel tanks, severed several hydraulic lines and electrical wires, and tore a large {{hole on the}} top of the wing over the wheel well area.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{tremendous}} <b>damage,</b> <b>number</b> of deaths, and people left missing, the name Ike was officially retired on April 22, 2009 by the World Meteorological Organization, and will never be used again for an Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with Isaias in the 2014 season. Isaias, however, was not used in 2014, {{so it could be}} used in 2020.|$|R

50|$|According to {{contemporary}} reports, a bomb fell next to Swaffield's Laundry, completely destroying number 66 and 68 College Road, and severely <b>damaging</b> <b>number</b> 64, where Mr. Higgins lived. A photograph showing College Road after this attack shows an ARP Rescue Squad climbing {{over a large}} pile of bricks that once were two semi-detached houses, vainly looking for survivors. It is very likely therefore that Both Edith and Percy were at home when it happened.|$|R
25|$|Even this fiasco was {{not enough}} to persuade McGruder to cancel the Mechanismo Project. She simply paid {{compensation}} to the victims' families and ordered Stich to rectify the fault in the robots' design and programming. Her ambitions suffered a further setback however when the <b>damaged</b> <b>Number</b> Five reactivated itself and embarked on a second killing spree, escaping from Justice Department premises and shooting judges and civilians alike. This time the robot escaped into the sewer system and was not recaptured.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{mechanical}} {{method by which}} violence is discouraged is simply the deadliness of combat in the game. Whilst Story Points act as a buffer helping prevent the actual deaths of a character, combat in the Doctor Who game tends to be swift and brutal, with many alien weapons simply doing [...] "Lethal" [...] damage, rather than a <b>damage</b> <b>number.</b> Characters that seek violent solutions to problems are at grave risk of injury, with damage being removed directly from character attributes.|$|R
40|$|In experiments, we {{have found}} an {{abnormal}} relationship between probability of laser induced <b>damage</b> and <b>number</b> density of surface inclusion. From results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and laser induced damage, we have drawn a conclusion that bulk inclusion {{plays a key role}} in damage process. Combining thermo-mechanical damage process and statistics of inclusion density distribution, we have deduced an equation which reflects the relationship between probability of laser induced <b>damage,</b> <b>number</b> density of inclusion, power density of laser pulse, and thickness of films. This model reveals that relationship between critical sizes of the dangerous inclusions (dangerous inclusions refer to the inclusions which can initialize film damage), embedded depth of inclusions, thermal diffusion length and tensile strength of films. This model develops the former work which is the statistics about surface inclusion. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

3000|$|... 1. The damage {{variable}} and damage constitutive model of concrete are further studied. Based on the meso-test of damage evolution characteristics of concrete, different damage variables of concrete materials {{are defined by}} different methods, and corresponding damage evolution equations are established. The damage constitutive relation is established {{on the basis of}} the piecewise damage evolution equation established by the <b>number</b> change. The <b>damage</b> evolution equation and damage constitutive relation established by the change of density <b>damage</b> <b>number</b> are related to the deterioration of macroscopic mechanical properties.|$|R
40|$|Wireworms {{can damage}} corn, {{resulting}} in stand loss during the seedling stage. Wireworms are the immature stage of click beetles and they range in length from 1 / 4 to 1 1 / 2 inches. Wireworms are found {{most often in}} grasslands or fields recently planted in sod. Occasionally, they are found in fields without any recent history of grasses. Why wireworms occur in <b>damaging</b> <b>numbers</b> in 2 ̆ 2 clean 2 ̆ 2 fields is a mystery {{that we have not}} yet been able to solve...|$|R
50|$|For {{the second}} challenge, the Federal Circuit {{found that the}} {{district}} court had in fact instructed the jury at trial that sales to the United States Government should not be included in any damages calculation. Besides, the <b>damage</b> <b>number</b> the jury awarded was also different from Finjan’s calculation. Moreover, the record showed that {{only a very small}} portion of the damage award was from sales to the United States. Therefore, the Federal Circuit decided that no new trial was necessary for the dispute around royalty base.|$|R
25|$|The third-costliest natural {{disaster}} {{to occur in}} the United States was Hurricane Andrew, which hit Miami in the early morning of Monday, August 24, 1992. It struck {{the southern part of the}} county from due east, south of Miami and very near Homestead, Kendall, and Cutler Ridge (now the Town of Cutler Bay). <b>Damages</b> <b>numbered</b> over US$25 billion in the county alone, and recovery has taken years in these areas where the destruction was greatest. This was the costliest {{natural disaster}} in US history until Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf region in 2005.|$|R

25|$|In 1811 Lieutenant Vallack was {{in command}} of Basilisk, with the British {{squadron}} at Cadiz. Between 27 and 29 March {{there was a tremendous}} gale at Cadiz that <b>damaged</b> a <b>number</b> of British vessels and blew Basilisk out to sea.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the pilots}} {{had tried to}} {{maintain}} control over the plane with a single remaining functioning engine, the plane crashed into apartment block number 45 on Mira Street. The tail section of the plane significantly <b>damaged</b> block <b>number</b> 120 and a neighboring orphanage.|$|R
50|$|Pensacola {{received}} 188 survivors from Hornet, {{whom she}} debarked at Nouméa on 30 October 1942. The task force had turned back a Japanese attempt to regain Guadalcanal, sunk Yura, and <b>damaged</b> a <b>number</b> of enemy capital ships. Japanese carriers lost 123 planes.|$|R

50|$|Cyclones {{have had}} a {{significant}} and devastating effect on the flora of the botanical gardens. In February 1986 Cyclone Winifred caused extensive damage and many trees, some nearly 100 years old, were severely <b>damaged.</b> A <b>number</b> of plants were lost {{at this time to}} theft.|$|R
50|$|Cattle grazing {{has caused}} {{substantial}} {{deterioration in the}} vegetation and physical environment of the springs and Salt Creek; Saunders Spring in 1997, and Grants Spring in 2001, were fenced to limit further <b>damage.</b> High <b>numbers</b> of feral camels and cats {{are present in the}} marsh.|$|R
40|$|Many {{different}} species of plant-parasitic nematodes occur in cornfields throughout the Midwest. Most of these microscopic, parasitic worms must reach a <b>damage</b> threshold <b>number</b> before they cause yield loss in corn. The <b>damage</b> threshold <b>numbers</b> for most nematodes that feed on corn in Iowa (see Common Corn Nematode Characteristics, ICM News, Aug. 3, 2009) are 100 or more worms per 100 cm 3, {{which is a little}} less than a half-cup of soil. The exceptions are the needle and sting nematodes, which damage corn even if only one or two worms per 100 cm 3 soil are present. Fortunately, needle and sting nematodes only occur in soil with at least 70 percent sand and, therefore, do not occur in most Iowa fields...|$|R
