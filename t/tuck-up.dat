6000|$|Her heart, seeking consolation, {{went back}} {{again and again to}} the time when he had wanted her; but it was far to go, to the days of holland suits, when all those things that he desired--slices of pineapple, Benson's old carriage-whip, the daily reading out of [...] "Tom Brown's School-days," [...] the rub with Elliman when he sprained his little ankle, the <b>tuck-up</b> in bed--were in her power alone to give.|$|E
50|$|Alaskan huskies are {{moderate}} in size, averaging 40 to 60 pounds (21 to 25 kg) for males, and 35 to 55 pounds (17 to 19 kg) for females. Some of them superficially resemble racing {{strains of}} the Siberian husky breed (which {{is part of the}} Alaskan husky genetic mix), but are usually smaller and leaner with a more pronounced <b>tuck-up.</b>|$|E
50|$|A dog {{uses its}} back to attain speed. The back's most {{flexible}} point is {{just over the}} loin area, and the <b>tuck-up</b> allows for the folding of the under portion of the dog's body. The rear legs overreach {{on the outside of}} the front legs. Essential for a fast dog is the ability to flex its back from a straight position to an arched position. A permanent arch is inflexible and is considered a serious fault. The double suspension gallop is a leaping gait, with the hind legs first propelling the dog into the air and then followed by the front legs propelling. The shoulder muscles, the ham muscles and the back muscles are the engines of this motion.|$|E
50|$|The {{chest is}} {{typically}} well developed and reaches to (FCI-Standard N° 283 / 04. 02. 2000 / GB) the elbows. A Coton de Tulear's feet {{are small and}} arched, and its back is normally strong and slightly arched. The pads of the feet are usually black. The body is of moderate length and typically has a moderate <b>tuck-up.</b> Traditionally, the loin is muscular and not overly long in length. The hind legs are normally strong and straight. The hind feet {{are similar to the}} front feet. Throughout history the dewclaws have been removed, however many would now oppose this arguably unnecessary and cruel procedure. The tail is traditionally low-set and tapering, carried over the back when in motion or excited, but relaxed otherwise.|$|E
50|$|The Bavarian Mountain Hound's head {{is strong}} and elongated. The skull is {{relatively}} broad and slightly domed. It has a pronounced stop and a slightly curved nosebridge. The muzzle should be broad with solid jaws, and its lips fully covering the mouth. Its nose is black or dark red with wide nostrils. Its ears are high set and medium in length. They are broader at the base and rounded at the tips, hanging heavily against the head. Its body is slightly longer than it is tall and slightly raised at the rump. The neck medium in length, strong, with a slight dewlap. Topline sloping slightly upward from withers to hindquarters. Chest well-developed, long, moderately wide, and well let-down with a slight <b>tuck-up.</b> It has a long, fairly straight croup and solid back. While its tail is set on high, medium in length and hanging to the hock, carried level to the ground or hanging down.|$|E
50|$|The Cretan Hound is {{a slender}} dog, {{somewhere in the}} middle between a scenthound and a sighthound in body, {{particularly}} light on its feet (that are oval rather than cat-like) and strong in loin, specially adopted for swift reflexes and high speed over dangerous, rocky terrain. The head is wedge-shaped, elongated and dry, with pricked and very mobile ears that fold backwards like a greyhound’s during the chase. The tail is a most important breed characteristic: long and curved upwards, forming a loose or tight ring and covered with a brush of longer hair underneath.The dog is slightly longer than tall, with medium angulations, slender legs and good muscle; the ribcage is spacious but neither too broad nor too rounded and it does not quite reach the point of elbow. The loin is slender yet powerful and there is good <b>tuck-up,</b> with the points of the hipbones slightly prominent. There should be a balance between characteristics of speed and stamina, the conformation being a compromise producing great agility. Flabby, clumsy, heavy individuals not to be tolerated.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{southern}} water spaniel bred to only {{adapt to the}} warmer climate of the southeastern USA. Coat length and density vary widely due to the variety of breeds {{that make up the}} recent background of this breed. Any coat type is acceptable, with some being almost curly like an American Water Spaniel to some with very straight fur like a Field Spaniel. Length is normally 1-2 inches throughout the body. A few bloodlines throw shorter, straight coats much like a Labrador Retriever. Feathering on the ears, chest, through the <b>tuck-up</b> and along the legs can be very little to moderate in density and length. Feathering may take on a sun-bleached golden to tawny color especially on the ears and should not be penalized. Groomed dogs should have a minimal of stripping or clipping, with slight shaping around the head and topline. Some individuals have a topknot like a Llewellin Setter. Field types are often shaved down and should not be penalized {{as long as it is}} of appropriate length to protect the skin. Improper shaving will result in some coats growing back in with excessive discoloration, fading or graying. White markings other than a mark on the chest, or a white mark on the chest that is more than 60% of the width of the chest, disqualify puppies from being registered with the Boykin Spaniel Society, although the American Kennel Club and United Kennel Club do not allow denial of registration for conformation reasons. White on the toes or chest is purely a cosmetic trait and will not affect the ability or health of the dog.|$|E
