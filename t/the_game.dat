5|$|A {{major theme}} of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> is heroism, where being a hero may bring {{more harm than}} help. During development, {{there was a point}} at the {{beginning}} of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> where players could choose to leave Dubai. This was cut from <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> as the team found it not effective enough, and it broke a player's immersion in <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> According to Williams, the choice system was originally designed to be similar to Fable II, where after a player makes a decision, they cannot reload <b>the</b> <b>game</b> and choose differently unless they start a new game. This was later removed due to the game's structure as a shooter, as the team feared that it might make <b>the</b> <b>game</b> unwinnable and cause players to feel frustrated. Williams later added that adding achievements to <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was a mistake, as it disrupts the game's narrative.|$|E
5|$|By July 1993 <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{was behind}} schedule; only the {{above-ground}} {{portions of the}} pyramid were complete. Jones put in eighteen-hour days for the month {{leading up to the}} MacWorld Expo where <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was to be sold; he finished <b>the</b> <b>game</b> in a relatively bug-free state just before the Expo, and Bungie had 500shrinkwrapped copies of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> available for sale at MacWorld.|$|E
5|$|Jarrett Lee entered <b>the</b> <b>game</b> as the Tigers' {{starting}} quarterback. However {{after he}} threw a pair of interceptions, Lee was replaced by Jordan Jefferson {{for the remainder of}} <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> In <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> Lee completed 3 of 7 passes for 24yards and Jefferson completed 6 of 10 passes for 67yards. The Tigers top receiver in <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was Russell Shepard who had 39yards on 2receptions.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>games</b> {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews.

5|$|Perfect Dark was {{developed}} and published by Rare for <b>the</b> <b>Game</b> Boy Color. <b>The</b> <b>game</b> was officially announced on January 13, 2000 when its Nintendo 64 counterpart was still under development. At the time, Rare had its Game Boy Color development team split into two: one for <b>the</b> <b>Game</b> Boy Color version of Donkey Kong Country {{and the other for}} Perfect Dark. Since Perfect Dark is one of Rare's latest games developed for <b>the</b> <b>Game</b> Boy Color, the developers wanted <b>the</b> <b>game</b> to support every Game Boy Color accessory and technology, including <b>the</b> <b>Game</b> Boy Printer, Transfer Pak, Game Link Cable, and infrared transmission of data between machines.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>game's</b> {{critical}} reception {{was much}} more positive. [...] GameSpy described it as [...] "one of the most fun, and almost more importantly, unique <b>games</b> to hit <b>the</b> scene [...]" [...] <b>The</b> <b>game's</b> graphics were very well received by reviewers; of particular note were <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> explosions, long draw distance, fanciful plane models, and large, open environments. [...] Critics wrote favorably of <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> audio, applauding strong voice acting {{as well as its}} swashbuckling and adventurous background music.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>game's</b> story {{received}} positive {{responses from}} critics. Jose Otero from 1UP.com {{thought that the}} story successfully combined with <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> gameplay. In addition, he praised the quality of <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> well-directed cutscenes. Ryan Clements from IGN considered <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> storytelling a refinement for the series. However, he criticised the length of <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> campaign, which he thought was too short. Ryan Taljonick from GamesRadar criticised <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> campaign {{as he called it}} [...] "predictible". He considered it a missed opportunity for DmC.|$|R
5|$|The Giants {{were awarded}} <b>the</b> <b>game</b> on February 9, 2005. <b>The</b> <b>game</b> {{marked the first}} time since 1962 that one league hosted {{consecutive}} All-Star Games, after Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, hosted <b>the</b> <b>game</b> in 2006.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>game</b> {{features}} an automap to help players navigate the {{different areas of}} <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Additionally, the player can pick up maps of certain sections to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, players need to find ink ribbons and use them with a typewriter; <b>the</b> <b>game</b> features a limited supply of ink ribbons, so players cannot save their progress {{as many times as}} they want. The story of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> is slightly altered by the character the player chooses to play as, and certain choices the player makes in <b>the</b> <b>game</b> can impact the direction of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> and its ending. Upon completing <b>the</b> <b>game</b> under a certain difficulty setting and time limit, the player may unlock secret costumes for the main characters, bonus weapons, and special difficulty modes.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>game</b> {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} upon its release; critics disparaged the game's short length, {{and although the}} game's variety was generally seen positively, reviewers noted little outstanding in <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Despite this mediocre reception, <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was nominated for two awards.|$|E

5|$|Tute {{originated}} in Italy. <b>The</b> <b>game</b> {{belongs to the}} same family as Brisca and has similar rules in gameplay and final count of points. The name of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> originated from the Italian word Tutti (all), the declaration that a player announces when holding the four kings. <b>The</b> <b>game</b> spread to Spain during the 19th century, brought back by Spanish troops who returned from missions in Italy. As the popularity of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> increased, its name was modified over time by Spanish speakers, who started calling <b>the</b> <b>game</b> Tute. <b>The</b> <b>game</b> {{became one of the}} most popular in Spain, leading to the later appearance of regional variations of <b>the</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> 1936 Summer <b>Games</b> were <b>the</b> <b>Games</b> of <b>the</b> XI Olympiad. After the 1940 and 1944 Summer Games were {{canceled}} due to World War II, <b>the</b> <b>Games</b> resumed in 1948 as <b>the</b> <b>Games</b> of <b>the</b> XIV Olympiad.|$|R
50|$|After {{the success}} of <b>the</b> first African <b>Games,</b> <b>the</b> {{organizing}} bodies awarded <b>the</b> second <b>games</b> to Bamako, Mali {{to be held in}} 1969. A military coup disrupted the plans and the organizers moved <b>the</b> <b>games</b> to Lagos, Nigeria to be held in 1971. <b>The</b> <b>games</b> were postponed once again and finally opened in January 1973.

5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{was simply}} called Magic {{through most of}} playtesting, when <b>the</b> <b>game</b> had to be officially named a lawyer {{informed}} them that the name Magic was too generic to be trademarked. Mana Clash was instead chosen to be the name used in the first solicitation of <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> however, everybody involved with <b>the</b> <b>game</b> continued to {{refer to it as}} Magic. After further consultation with the lawyer, it was decided to rename <b>the</b> <b>game</b> Magic: The Gathering, thus enabling the name to be trademarked.|$|E
5|$|A Nintendo 3DS {{version of}} <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> titled 3D Sonic the Hedgehog, was {{released}} {{as part of}} the 3D Classics line in 2013. This version, unlike most downloadable re-releases of <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> is not emulated; rather, the game's code was restructured to allow it {{to take advantage of the}} 3DS system's stereoscopic 3D graphics and comes with additional enhancements, such as the option to use the Spin Dash move, a CRT-style filter, and the option to start <b>the</b> <b>game</b> from any level.|$|E
5|$|A Tony Romo {{touchdown}} {{pass in the}} third quarter gave the Cowboys their first lead of <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> The lead was extended when Nick Folk converted his second field goal of the day, putting the Cowboys up 13–3 as <b>the</b> <b>game</b> entered the final quarter. Reed converted his second field goal of <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> bringing the Steelers within seven points with 7:20 remaining in regulation.

5|$|A common {{criticism}} of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> is its short length. Episode One takes roughly 4–6 hours to complete, {{which raises the}} issue of whether <b>the</b> <b>game</b> justifies its price. Computer Games Magazine argued the futility of reviewing <b>the</b> <b>game</b> due to its episodic nature; as the first part of a three-part story arc, it is difficult to judge it when divorced from the final product. Game Revolution expressed disappointment at a lack of new features such as environments and weapons.|$|E
5|$|A {{demonstration}} of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{was released on}} 26 June 2002, featuring tutorial missions and a full single-player mission. <b>The</b> <b>game</b> was released on 19 August in North America and on 30 August in Europe.

5|$|A season {{highlight}} was {{the final}} game against Stanford's arch-rival California at California Memorial Stadium, the last game of the regular season. Before <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> both teams were undefeated and Stanford had not beaten California since 1905. Nevers did not play due to a broken ankle. Late in <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> California was leading 20–3; California coach Andy Smith, sure <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was over, began substituting regular players. Warner {{seized the opportunity to}} combine passing with the trick plays for which he was known (a fake reverse and a full spinner), and Stanford made a comeback. <b>The</b> <b>game</b> ended in a 20–20 tie.|$|E
50|$|Throughout <b>the</b> <b>Games</b> period, {{transport}} {{played a}} crucial role for those enjoying <b>the</b> <b>Games,</b> those working at <b>the</b> <b>Games,</b> and those competing at <b>the</b> <b>Games.</b> Glasgow hosted 4,500 athletes who required transportation between the Athletes' Village, training venues, and competition venues. Athletes travelled in minibuses or coaches, which used, where necessary, dedicated lanes - known as <b>the</b> <b>Games</b> Route Network - to ensure they are given priority over other traffic in a similar way buses are in bus lanes.
