5|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> being {{a simpler}} project {{due to the}} {{original}} art being reusable {{turned out to be}} untrue: because so much time had passed since the original's release, there were multiple parts that had to be reworked, leading to a process similar to creating a whole new game from scratch. All character graphics were redone, special effects were changed, and certain animations were added, such as sleeping animations. Some item placements were changed, the overall difficulty was adjusted, and some characters' battle statistics were altered; one such instance was making Kechi stronger than Oryu, due to it being perceived as illogical that a person with a sword would be weaker than a person fighting with her bare hands.|$|E

500|$|... "One Love" [...] is a R song, with {{a length}} of three minutes and fifty-four seconds (3:54). It was written by Lopez, along with A-Plus (Anesha Birchett and Antea Shelton) and the song's {{producer}} Emile [...] "D'Mile" [...] Dernst II. A-Plus (Birchett and Shelton) and D'Mile wrote and presented the song to Lopez, who loved <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> but thought the track to be [...] "very generic". In response, she asked: [...] "Why don't we make it more 'me'?". Lopez then sat with them and wrote new verses for the song, going through every major relationship she had, asking the question: [...] "is there one love?". Lopez described the song as being about [...] "if we can ever have one true soul mate". She recorded her vocals for the song with Kuk Harrell at Record Plant Recording Studios, with additional vocal production from Josh Gudwin, Jim Annunziato and Birchett. John Kercy was responsible for Lopez's vocal editing on [...] "One Love", which was later mixed by Mike [...] "Handz" [...] Donaldson at Chalice Recording Studios.|$|E
500|$|Reaction to the film's preview segment was mixed. Kotaku heavily {{praised the}} effects, {{undertone}} and music, {{stating that the}} staff loved it, though lamented that an official film of this kind would join {{a long line of}} [...] "ill-advised live-action adaptations". Game Informer called it [...] "absurd", stating that while it was a possible proof of concept film it was more likely completely fake, and adding [...] "It looks goofy as hell, and Pokéfans are sure to get a couple chuckles out of it if nothing else." [...] ComicsAlliance called it [...] "somewhere in the middle" [...] of presenting a better take on the franchise and a reminder that [...] "some intellectual properties got things right (or inherently wrong) the first time", though called the effect [...] "surprisingly competent" [...] and it both generally fun and funny. Crave Online heavily criticized the film, calling the story formulaic and the production values [...] "threadbare", and further adding that they dreaded <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> inspiring an actual live-action film on the series in light of Capcom's [...]|$|E

But there's still nothing definitive, not even a skeletal version {{of what it would}} be." [...] In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a [...] "Planet Hulk" [...] film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in Phase Two of the MCU, by saying, [...] "After the first Avengers, Iron Man had his own movie, Thor had his own movie, Captain America had his own movie, and Widow and Fury were in [...] So it was really about, frankly, saving somebody so that the only place you could get Hulk between Avengers movies is the next Avengers movie, so [...] could continue to play with that in [...] Where we go after that, we'll see." [...] In October 2014, again on a solo film, Feige said [...] "we'll see. We'd love to do it, we'd love to find the place to put it, but right now, Hulk will be appearing, with his friends, in their [...] films." ...|$|E

Björk had recorded the vocals, bass line and chord structure of [...] "Hunter" [...] before Bell met her in Spain; he recorded the beats in one take after she had explained to him how she wanted them to sound like. In an interview with Sweater, Björk said: [...] "It amazes me that people still can't grasp that live element of it." [...] Regarding {{the beat of the}} song, engineer Markus Dravs stated it [...] "is very much a Mark Bell beat interpretation of her. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> being a Boleric beat was hers, but we tried different versions and I think it was Mark in the end {{who came up with the}} idea of just doing it on a 909.

She and Jessica [...] loved working together. So we came up with this character and I like that she's around in all the individual stories at that pivotal moment of are you going to fight {{or are you going to}} die." [...] He added, [...] "But when we were coming with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> I was meeting with hair and make up and Lou Eyrich, the costumer, and we at first came up with this idea that she was the black version of Miss Havisham. But I didn't like that. I thought let's do something unexpected. So our inspirations were very bizarre. We took sort of like 1940s, hard-boiled noir women and mixed it with a sort of Comme des Garçons meets Japanese thing. I was very proud of that look and I thought Franny was very yummy. You could see why people would want her to kiss them." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{composing}} for a {{film with}} such a large cast, Silvestri said, [...] "I’ve worked on films where {{there have been a}} number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world ... the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together." [...] Later elaborating on this, Silvestri said, [...] "We knew that if we were to have a theme for every character in this movie, the music would get very clunky and intrusive. So I stayed away from all of that." [...] Instead, Marvel and Whedon wanted a central, definable [...] "Avengers" [...] theme for the film, which Silvestri wanted to have a heroic aspect and a grandness, but also be [...] "generated from that scene when they’re all gathering for the last great battle ... the interesting thing about it as the 'big moment; of the score is that they’re not doing anything. They’re standing there, which allowed me to move away from <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> being an action moment." [...] Silvestri did ultimately use some other themes in the score: he developed a motif for Loki as the central villain of the film, a [...] "low, ominous sequence of chords, [...] when his presence is either visible or implied"; he reprised his Captain America theme, for when that character [...] "makes his entrance, or when he’s in the middle of a fight scene ... yet not using it fully" [...] as [...] "a little of his theme goes a long, long way", and his Tesseract theme, including over the opening logos of the film; and midway through Silvestri's work writing the score, Whedon had seen some completed scenes featuring the Black Widow and [...] "wanted to explore music that was a bit more thematic for her", so Silvestri introduced [...] "a lonely, plucked theme with an Eastern European flavor" [...] to define the character. For the other major characters, Silvestri used instrumentation to differentiate their scenes, for instance Iron Man [...] "always has the more contemporary, rhythmic component to a lot of his music." ...|$|E
