500|$|Leyba {{developed}} a grand plan of defense {{that included the}} construction of four stone towers. Without funds or <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them from New Orleans, Leyba asked the villagers to contribute funds and labor {{to the construction of}} these fortifications and paid for some of the work from his private funds. [...] By mid-May, a single round tower had been built that was about [...] in diameter and 30 to 40 feet tall. The tower, dubbed Fort San Carlos, provided a commanding view of the surrounding countryside. As there {{did not appear to be}} sufficient time to build more towers, trenches were dug between the tower and the river to the north and south of the village. [...] Three four-pound and two six-pound cannons from Fort Don Carlos were mounted in the tower, and other cannons were emplaced at each end of the line of trenches. [...] Fort Don Carlos had been constructed earlier in 1767 on the south bank of the Missouri river, near its mouth, just 15 miles north of the village of St. Louis.|$|E
500|$|Although Drymon had a {{significant}} influence on SpongeBob SquarePants, he was not initially offered a role on the series. As a late recruit to Rocko's Modern Life, he had not established much of a relationship with Hillenburg before SpongeBobs conception. Hillenburg first sought out Drymon's storyboard partner, Mark O'Hare - but O'Hare had just created the soon-to-be syndicated comic strip, Citizen Dog, and while he would later join SpongeBob as a writer, lacked <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> involved with both projects at the outset. Drymon has said, [...] "I remember Hillenburg's bringing it up to Mark in our office and asking him if he'd be interested in working on it...I was all ready {{to say yes to}} the offer, but Steve didn't ask; he just left the room. I was pretty desperate...so I ran into the hall after him and basically begged him for the job. He didn't jump at the chance." [...] Once Hillenburg had given it some thought and decided to bring Drymon on as creative director, the two began meeting at Hillenburg's house multiple times a week to develop the series. Drymon has identified this period as having begun in 1996, shortly after the end of Rocko's Modern Life.|$|E
500|$|Sharma next {{reunited with}} Yash Raj Films in Sultan (2016), a romantic sports drama from the writer-director Ali Abbas Zafar. She {{took on the}} role of Aarfa Hussain, a wrestler from Haryana who inspires the title {{character}} (played by Salman Khan) to take up the sport. Sharma was initially hesitant about the role as she did not have the physique of a wrestler, and researched on different weight categories to [...] "beat people’s perception that all wrestlers are huge." [...] She was trained for six weeks in the sport, learned to speak the Haryanvi dialect and also interacted with female wrestlers from the state. The film and her performance received mixed reviews. Critics were appreciative of her substantial role in an androcentric film; Filmfares Rachit Gupta described Sharma as [...] "the best thing in the film" [...] and noted that ven though she doesn't have the physique of a wrestler, her spirited performance makes you believe in her tough but emotional character." [...] However, Suprateek Chatterjee of The Huffington Post felt that she was unconvincing as a wrestler, writing that [...] "she possesses literally zero muscles and somehow always finds <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> her make-up just right.” With earnings of over [...] worldwide, Sultan ranks among Indian cinema's biggest grossers.|$|E

After one fierce clash Churchill told {{his chief of}} staff and military adviser, Sir Hastings Ismay, that he did not think he could continue to work any longer with Brooke because [...] "he hates me. I can see hatred looking from his eyes." [...] Brooke responded to Ismay: “Hate him? I don't hate him. I love him. But the first time I tell him that I agree with him when I don't will be <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of me, for then I can be no more use to him."

2500|$|In 1951, Straffen was {{examined}} at a Bristol hospital, where electroencephalograph readings {{showed that he}} had suffered [...] "wide and severe damage to the cerebral cortex, probably from an attack of encephalitis in India {{before the age of}} six." [...] By now, however, Straffen was considered sufficiently rehabilitated to be allowed a period of unescorted home leave. He used <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a job at a market garden, which he was allowed to keep. Hortham licensed him to the care of his mother, as the family home was less overcrowded. When Straffen's 21st birthday came, under the Mental Deficiency Act, he had to be reassessed by Hortham, which continued his certificate for a further five years; the family disputed the assessment and appealed. [...] As a result, the Medical Officer of Health for Bath examined Straffen again on 10 July 1951 and found improvement in mental age to 10; he recommended that Straffen's certificate be renewed only for six months with a view to discharge at the end.|$|E

2500|$|Much of {{this case}} {{is derived from the}} {{precedent}} set in [...] Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132 (1925), where the Supreme Court ruled that police officers may make a warrantless search of an automobile if they have probable cause to suspect that it contains contraband. This is known as the [...] "automobile exception" [...] to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement. The court's reasoning in Carroll v. United States was twofold: First, the [...] "practical mobility" [...] of an automobile made it impractical to take <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a search warrant from a magistrate, since in that time the vehicle could leave the jurisdiction. Second, vehicles were presumed to have a lower expectation of privacy than houses or personal containers, since they provide clear visibility of their contents (through the windows), and their primary purpose is the transportation of people instead of the storage of personal property. This particular case dealt with law enforcement officers that tore through the car's upholstery to find illegal liquor in a hidden compartment.|$|E

Her other songs, including [...] "Fantasy", [...] "Dr. Jolin", [...] "Gentlewoman", and [...] "We're All Different, Yet the Same", all cater to the gay audience and support same-sex love. In 2012, she signed the petition calling for Taiwan's government passing Marriage Equality Act and legalizing same-sex marriage in Taiwan. Recognized as a long-term ally of the LGBT community, Tsai was given the Icon Award at the 2nd Asia LGBT Milestone Awards to praise her putting aside the pressure of public opinion and appreciate her using her influence to support same-sex love in Chinese-speaking world. In 2015, Tsai featured {{on the cover of}} lesbian-themed magazine Lezs. In an interview with Lezs, she spoke about homophobia and advocated people to embrace all kinds of love. She stated, [...] "we have to give them <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to understand one another, since the definition of love varies from person to person." [...] During her Play World Tour (2015–2016), Tsai gave a speech to support transgender people, and spoke against the bullying of children and teenagers in general, including the bullying of gay teens and a related recent suicide in Taiwan.|$|E
