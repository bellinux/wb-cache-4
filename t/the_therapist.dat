While {{most of them}} have positive experiences with her, Bolander (Ned Beatty) flatly refuses to participate and repeatedly avoids their scheduled sessions. When Gee (Yaphet Kotto) tells Bolander he will be suspended without pay if he does not meet with her, Bolander chooses the suspension, but later reconsiders after his partner Munch (Richard Belzer) harasses him at the bar until he changes his mind. When they finally meet, Bolander explains he does not trust therapists because when going through marriage counseling with his ex-wife, <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> actively encouraged her to leave Bolander. He feels he was cheated out of $7,000 in therapy bills, but Westin explains his anger is not from the money, but from feelings of betrayal by his ex-wife. Bolander is ultimately impressed by Westin and even decides to ask her on a date, but she strongly hints she is a lesbian.|$|E

Reich's son, Peter, wrote in his autobiography, Book of Dreams (1973) about the pain this had caused him. Susanna Steig, the daughter of William Steig, the New Yorker cartoonist, wrote about being pressed so hard during Reichian therapy that she had difficulty breathing, and said that a woman therapist had sexually assaulted her.

40|$|Purpose of reviewThe {{purpose of}} this review {{is to provide a}} {{comprehensive}} and critical examination of the empirical literature about the relation between patient personality and therapist countertransference. Recent findingsThe therapist's countertransference can {{play a crucial role in}} psychotherapy outcomes, especially in the treatment of personality disorders. <b>The</b> <b>therapist's</b> emotional responses to patients can accomplish the following: inform the clinician about the patient's personality, impact therapy outcome, influence patient resistance and elaboration, mediate the influence of <b>the</b> <b>therapist's</b> interventions and influence therapeutic alliance. SummaryIn the last years, several studies have empirically demonstrated the presence of a specific pattern of therapist responses that are related to different patient personality disorders. Other works showed how the effects of <b>the</b> <b>therapist's</b> technique depend on the emotional context in which they are delivered and in particular countertransference experiences. Moreover, researchers suggest that <b>the</b> <b>therapist's</b> emotional responses occur across all kinds of therapy and are independent of <b>the</b> <b>therapist's</b> theoretical preferences.

When the physical therapist arrives, he pretends to be starving and abused. <b>The</b> <b>therapist</b> tells Bree she must be more patient, or she will be reported. Later, when Orson still refuses to be bathed, Bree takes him outside and sprays him with the garden hose until he begs her to stop.

Haddies tries to convince Adam {{to teach her}} instead, but he refuses. Later, during another lesson, Kristina distresses Haddie so much she crashes into a garbage can, damaging a side mirror. The two later argue, but they eventually reconcile, and Kristina explains she dreads the idea of her daughter dying in an accident. Meanwhile, Crosby (Dax Shepard) meets and seems attracted to Gaby (Minka Kelly), <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> helping Max (Max Burkholder). Crosby is {{trying to cope with}} missing his son Jabbar (Tyree Brown) and girlfriend Jasmine (Joy Bryant), who is in New York City pursuing her dancing career. Jabbar plans to visit Crosby, who promises Max the two boys can have a sleepover, much to Max's excitement. However, Jasmine later tells Crosby she cannot visit after all due to an audition. When Crosby tells Max, he grows hysterical due to his Asperger syndrome. He is calmed by Gaby while Crosby watches, realizing the extent of Max's problems. Haddie later has a sleepover with a now-happy Max.|$|E
25|$|Music therapy {{comes in}} two {{different}} forms: active and receptive. In active therapy, <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> and patient actively participate in creating music with instruments, their voice, or other objects.

25|$|Psychotherapies are {{categorized}} {{in several}} different ways. A distinction can be made between those based on a medical model and those based on a humanistic model. In the medical model the client is seen as unwell and <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> employs their skill to help the client back to health. The extensive use of the DSM-IV, {{the diagnostic and statistical}} manual of mental disorders in the United States, is an example of a medically exclusive model. The humanistic or non-medical model in contrast strives to depathologise the human condition. <b>The</b> <b>therapist</b> attempts to create a relational environment conducive to experiential learning and help build the client's confidence in their own natural process resulting in a deeper understanding of themselves. <b>The</b> <b>therapist</b> may see themselves as a facilitator/helper.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} <b>the</b> <b>therapist's</b> pregnancy on a client's unconscious phantasy. At first, the concept of unconscious phantasy, its contents and purpose are discussed in a historical context. Secondly, previous studies {{on the effects of}} <b>the</b> <b>therapist's</b> pregnancy on <b>the</b> process of psychotherapy are reviewed, and the important issues are discussed. Thirdly, clinical material is presented to show how a client's unconscious phantasy was evoked by <b>the</b> <b>therapist's</b> pregnancy and how this unconscious phantasy developed. Finally the phantasy is reviewed in the light of Kleinian theories' such as "preconception" (Bion, 1962) and "purpose of psychoanalysis" (Money-Kyrle, 1971). It is concluded that <b>the</b> <b>therapist's</b> pregnancy is not only a crisis for the client but also a valuable opportunity for development, because it stimulates the most basic anxieties of the client...|$|R
40|$|The author {{addressed}} {{the question of}} consistency in psychotherapists' countertransference feelings. Research findings have indicated that <b>the</b> <b>therapist's</b> own personal feeling style {{may be more important}} than the patient's impact on <b>the</b> <b>therapist's</b> feelings. In this study, the feelings of 9 psychotherapists toward 28 patients were followed by using checklist self-report after each session during moderately long psychotherapies. ANOVAs and discriminant analyses showed that <b>the</b> <b>therapists</b> were very consistent in their feeling style over different patients and over time. The consistency in feelings toward the individual patients was smaller. Deviations from consistency are analyzed, and their importance for the understanding of different aspects of the countertransference is discussed. It is suggested that a meaningful use of the countertransference concept ought to be based on systematic identifications of recurrent and deviant patterns in <b>the</b> <b>therapist's</b> reactions...|$|R
25|$|It's {{also been}} {{suggested}} {{that the use of}} gaming systems for home-based rehabilitation may promote a lack of communication between <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> and the patient. In these cases, it is difficult to track the progress of the patient appropriately, and the effects of the therapy are unknown. It's also possible in these scenarios that a lack of tracking also increases time spent on task, since <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> does not properly see what level the patient is performing at.|$|E

25|$|The {{notion of}} fusing horizons {{serves as a}} guiding model for {{therapeutic}} dialogue. Furthermore, this process necessitates the need for <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> to allow what the client says to matter to him and even challenge what he believes. Instead of <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> assuming the role of expert, he rids himself of any therapist hubris and shares authority with the client, therefore allowing for safe conversation and critical openness toward both counselor and client. By both remaining open, horizons from each party are mutually influenced.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, a dialogical {{perspective}} {{has emerged}} in the family therapy field in which <b>the</b> <b>therapist's</b> inner conversation is conceptualized as a dialogical self.

We propose a descriptive model of <b>the</b> <b>therapist's</b> inner conversation with four positions.

25|$|Art therapy may {{focus on}} the {{creative}} art-making process itself, as therapy, or on the analysis of expression gained through an exchange of patient and therapist interaction.

Analysis of transference is no longer always a component.|$|E
25|$|Paul Ricoeur discussed, in {{a similar}} vein to Martin and Sugarman and Mensch, the concept of intropathy through which he {{described}} imagination as a representation “of things absent but still existing somewhere else” (p.171).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how therapists' use of humor in psychotherapy would affect subjects' ratings of those therapists. Short excerpts illustrating different levels of humor were developed by having four professional therapists view videotapes of actual therapy sessions and rate <b>the</b> <b>therapists</b> on amount of humor used. Interjudge agreement was obtained on six excerpts. These six included two excerpts in which <b>the</b> <b>therapists</b> were judged to have used no humor, two in which <b>the</b> <b>therapists</b> were judged to have used a slight amount of humor and two in which <b>the</b> <b>therapists</b> were judged to have used a moderate amount of humor. These six excerpts were then viewed and rated by 72 subjects on the dimensions of empathy, respect, warmth, genuineness, concreteness and self-disclosure. It was found that significant differences existed between all three humor groups on the condition of respect. The group judged to have used no humor was rated superior to the two groups using humor in amount to respect shown by <b>the</b> <b>therapists</b> to <b>the</b> clients. When the two groups judged to have used humor were compared, the group in which <b>the</b> <b>therapists</b> used more humor was rated significantly lower than the group judged to have used a slight amount of humor. It was concluded that subjects' ratings on the condition of respect decreased as greater amounts of humor were introduced by <b>the</b> <b>therapists.</b> Significant differences were not found between humor groups on the conditions of empathy, warmth, genuineness, concreteness and self-disclosure. However, the pattern observed in the subjects' ratings on the conditions of empathy and warmth suggested that the ratings given to therapists decreased as amount of humor increased. The results on the conditions of genuineness and concreteness were inconclusive. On the condition of self-disclosure, the pattern observed in the ratings suggested that a direct relationship existed between amount of humor and ratings received...|$|R

25|$|Empathy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of humanistic therapy. This idea focuses on the therapist’s ability to see the world through the eyes of the client. Without this, therapists can be forced to apply an external frame of reference where <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> is no longer understanding the actions and thoughts of the client as the client would, but strictly as a therapist which defeats the purpose of humanistic therapy. Included in empathizing, unconditional positive regard {{is one of the}} key elements of humanistic psychology. Unconditional positive regard refers to the care that <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> needs to have for the client. This ensures that <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> does not become the authority figure in the relationship allowing for a more open flow of information as well as a kinder relationship between the two. A therapist practicing humanistic therapy needs to show a willingness to listen and ensure the comfort of the patient where genuine feelings may be shared but are not forced upon someone. Marshall Rosenberg, one of Carl Rogers' students, emphasizes empathy in the relationship in his concept of Nonviolent Communication.|$|E
