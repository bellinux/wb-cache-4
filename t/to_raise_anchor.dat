500|$|At 06:00 on 6 February Duckworth's scouts sighted the French, observing two frigates, five {{ships of}} the line and one large {{merchant}} ship anchored in line at the entrance to Santo Domingo. Leissègues had reportedly issued orders for the squadron to sail for Jamaica, even though several of the French ships were not yet ready for sea, and two frigates were already under sail when the British arrived. Leissègues was not aboard Impérial; he and a number of his officers were still conducting their business in the town and were therefore forced to join the squadron in small boats, which delayed the squadron. Several officers, possibly including Leissègues, did not reach their ships until after the engagement had begun. Recognising that his enemy was in a vulnerable position, Duckworth raised all sail in an effort to close with the French. Leissègues too recognised the danger his ships were in and ordered them <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>anchor</b> and then to sail westwards along the coast in the direction of Nizao. Maintaining close formation, the French formed a line of battle, Captain Pierre-Elie Garreau in Alexandre leading, with Impérial, Diomède, Jupiter and Brave following. [...] The frigates and corvette took a position between the battle line and the shore. Duckworth was concerned that there might be other French forces to the west. He therefore angled his line of attack to pass across the front of the French line and signaled to his squadron to direct their fire at the front three ships: Alexandre, Impérial and Diomède.|$|E

5000|$|Flandre was the French Lines {{first new}} ocean liner {{following}} World War II. Her maiden voyage {{was considered a}} complete disaster, as she experienced mechanical difficulties throughout the voyage. The first sign of trouble was when her fuel line filters became clogged with impurities in the oil that she was carrying. This caused her to become essentially [...] "dead in the water" [...] for four hours while her fuel filters were cleaned out and her boilers restored to normal operation. This was repeated later in the voyage, after which Flandres captain elected to reduce speed {{for the remainder of}} the voyage. Upon arrival at the Quarantine Station at New York, she experienced a short circuit in her main electrical switchboard causing a near-complete loss of power.

5000|$|Aboard Donald's ship, he {{acts as a}} {{proud and}} able sea captain.

They are asked <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the <b>anchor,</b> but as they are raising it, it gets caught on a rock under the water. Not realizing what's wrong, Donald attempts <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the <b>anchor</b> himself but runs into the same problem. Angrily, he tries again but pushes so hard the boat sinks instead of the anchor rising and goes underwater. At first, Donald does not know what has happened - even thinking he sees [...] "flying fish" [...] and [...] "flying turtles" [...] - but finally finds out what has happened, and lowers the anchor to make the boat rise. In the process, he is thrown into the mast, getting tangled up in flags. His nephews find this funny and laugh, but Donald responds by angrily telling them <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the sail. However, they do not raise it properly, pulling the sail, while still between its masts, upward instead of outward. When he tells them to do it the right way, they say [...] "Aye aye, sir!" [...] and unintentionally let it fall on Donald. Donald loses his temper and raises the sail himself, and the ship finally leaves the dock.|$|R
50|$|In most respects, she {{resembled a}} {{scaled-down}} protected cruiser, a steel warship with a modern design and up-to-date armament, and very comfortable quarters for her crew. However, {{in order to}} navigate on uncharted coasts and tropical rivers, she was given a very compact shallow-draught hull, and this meant she only had a very limited coal supply. In addition, low technology was used to minimize construction cost and logistical requirements. As a result, the Thistle was given a two-masted sailing rig as a supplementary means of propulsion, along {{with a number of}} other anachronistic features such as a manual capstan <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the <b>anchor,</b> and candles rather than light bulbs.|$|R
50|$|Germania made {{it through}} the pack ice thanks to its {{auxiliary}} engine and, during late summer, explored the region around Sabine Island, Little Pendulum Island and Shannon. On 13 September 1869 it was anchored near the south coast of Sabine Island for wintering. During autumn and the following spring, sledge trips were made Clavering Island and Tyrolerfjord to the south-west and as far north as Store Koldewey Island and Germania Land. In late July 1870, Germania was able <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>anchor</b> and continue north, however, only to find the way blocked by pack ice. After eight days, it was decided to head south instead, and extensive exploration of the vast fjord systems of north-east Greenland, most notably the Kejser Franz Joseph Fjord, was undertaken.

50|$|In {{order to}} further reduce the {{logistical}} requirements (and construction costs) {{of the new}} gunboats, {{a number of other}} decisions were taken which seemed almost willfully anachronistic. They had copper sheathing to protect their hulls against fouling in tropical seas. With minimal machinery, old-fashioned human strength on the capstan was required <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the <b>anchors,</b> and a functional ship's wheel was provided to turn the rudder. All lighting came from candles rather than light bulbs. Only one of the four ship's boats was equipped with an engine, the rest being powered by sails and oars.

When on duty, there were many repetitive tasks, such as turning the capstan <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the <b>anchor</b> and heaving on ropes <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> and lower the sails. To synchronise the crew's efforts, sea shanties were sung, with a lead singer performing the verse and the sailors joining in the chorus. In the Royal Navy in Nelson's time, these work songs were banned, being replaced by the notes of a fife or fiddle, or the recitation of numbers.|$|R

On December 23, the ship was boarded by members of LTTE's naval wing, the Sea Tigers. According to the crew, the rebels ordered them <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the <b>anchor,</b> after trying and failing to blow up the anchor cable, then forced them into smaller boats.

In order to fool the Dutch to expect otherwise, Zheng chose to use large warjunks as the fireships, decking them with cannon and soldiers (who were equipped with bamboo tubes and were to jump overboard just before crashing the ship into the enemy fleet). The Dutch did not expect the large warjunks to come straight at them, hence they did not even have time <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> their <b>anchors.</b> Ming fireships {{set fire to the}} Broeckerhaven.
