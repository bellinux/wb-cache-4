40|$|The typical {{shapes of}} snow {{crystals}} of low temperature types {{that are known}} at present are "Gohei twins", "Sea gull", "Spearhead" and so on. Although they were named {{by one of the}} authors (K. K.) tentatively, these names appear to be accepted by scientists in the fields of cloud physics, crystal growth and so on. On the other hand, their formation mechanisms except for the gohei <b>twin</b> <b>crystals</b> have not been clarified. In this paper, the correlation between the gohei twin, sea gull, and spearhead type crystals has been considered based on a number of microphotographs taken by a polarizing microscope during the observation period from December 25, 1985 to January 23, 1986 at Inuvik (68 ° 22 ′N, 133 ° 42 ′W), N. W. T., Arctic Canada. As a result, although we have pointed out that the gohei <b>twin</b> type <b>crystals</b> are two kinds that have tip angles of 56 and 78 °, they have another difference besides the difference of their tip angles. Namely, the gohei <b>twin</b> <b>crystals</b> having the tip angle of 56 ° have a certain kind of finlike appendages along the crystalline boundary of two extended prism planes of the crystals. On the other hand, other <b>twin</b> <b>crystals</b> that have the tip angle of 78 ° are devoid of finlike appendages along the crystalline boundary. The angles of 13 and 20 ° between two extended prism planes of the gohei <b>twin</b> <b>crystals</b> pointed out in our previous papers were clarified by the measurement of the tip angles of individual extended prism planes. Furthermore, it was noted that the gohei <b>twin</b> <b>crystals</b> that have the tip angle of 56 ° are similar to the spearhead type crystals, and the spearhead type crystals were one of the wings of the sea gull type crystals seen from a right angle. However, some parts of the formation mechanisms of snow crystals of low temperature types are obscure and {{it would be difficult to}} understand their exact correlation as of this report...|$|R

40|$|Merohedral or pseudomerohedral {{twinning}} of crystals {{cannot be}} identi®ed from {{inspection of the}} diffraction patterns. Several methods for the identi®cation of twinning and the estimation of the twin fraction are suitable for macro-molecular crystals and {{all are based on}} the statistical properties of the measured diffraction intensities. If the crystal twin fraction is estimated and is not too close to 0. 5, the diffraction data can be detwinned; that is, related to the individual crystal specimen. However, the detwinning proce-dure invariably introduces additional inaccuracies to the estimated intensities, which substantially increase when the twin fraction approaches 0. 5.
