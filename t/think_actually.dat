5000|$|Discussion of Die Glocke {{originated}} {{in the works of}} Igor Witkowski. His 2000 Polish language book Prawda o Wunderwaffe (The Truth About The Wonder Weapon, reprinted in German as Die Wahrheit über die Wunderwaffe), refers to it as [...] "The Nazi-Bell". Witkowski wrote that he first discovered the existence of Die Glocke by reading transcripts from an interrogation of former Nazi SS Officer Jakob Sporrenberg. According to Witkowski, he was shown the allegedly classified transcripts in August 1997 by an unnamed Polish intelligence contact who said he had access to Polish government documents regarding Nazi secret weapons. Witkowski maintains that he was only allowed to transcribe the documents and was not allowed to make any copies. Although no evidence of the veracity of Witkowski’s statements has been produced, they reached a wider audience when they were retold by British author Nick Cook, who added his own views to Witkowski’s statements in The Hunt for Zero Point. Author Jason Colavito wrote that Witkowski's claims were [...] "recycled" [...] from 1960s rumors of Nazi occult science first published in Morning of the Magicians, and describes Die Glocke as [...] "a device few outside of fringe culture <b>think</b> <b>actually</b> existed.

5000|$|Nāgārjuna's Madhyamaka {{philosophy}} discusses nirmita, or illusion {{closely related}} to māyā. In this example, the illusion is a self-awareness that is, like the magical illusion, mistaken. For Nagarjuna, the self is not the organizing command center of experience, as we might <b>think.</b> <b>Actually,</b> it is just one element combined with other factors and strung together in a sequence of causally connected moments in time. As such, the self is not substantially real, but neither can it {{be shown to be}} unreal. The continuum of moments, which we mistakenly understand to be a solid, unchanging self, still performs actions and undergoes their results. [...] "As a magician creates a magical illusion by the force of magic, and the illusion produces another illusion, in the same way the agent is a magical illusion and the action done is the illusion created by another illusion." [...] What we experience may be an illusion, but we are living inside the illusion and bear the fruits of our actions there. We undergo the experiences of the illusion. What we do affects what we experience, so it matters. In this example, Nagarjuna uses the magician's illusion to show that the self is not as real as it thinks, yet, to the extent it is inside the illusion, real enough to warrant respecting the ways of the world.|$|E

40|$|URL] In The Emotional Construction of Morals (2007), Jesse Prinz {{offers a}} {{coherent}} naturalist approach on {{the foundations of}} human moral normativity. He classifies his view as a sensibility theory, a realist approach conspicuously opposed to the anti-realist bent of traditional emotivism. I sympathize with Prinz’s general approach; nevertheless, I have some specific disagreements. The first concerns the “is-ought” problem. I don’t {{think it is possible}} to build a realist, and a naturalist, approach in ethics without answering the famous problem with a positive stance. That is, without showing that it is actually possible to make the suspect transition—at least if we take “normativity” as a natural fact (as Hume, I <b>think,</b> <b>actually</b> thought). Here I will evaluate what I think are the main issues of Prinz’s approach. One issue that deserves to be commented on is the contrast between Prinz’s view and John Searle's well-known approach regarding the is-ought problem. Prinz thinks that Searle’s argument favouring the passage from an "is" to an "ought" is not cogent, but the correct understanding of Searle's argument requires assuming “obligations” (and duties) as factual. Therefore, what a naturalist theory must explain is how it is possible to pass from the fact that one is under a particular obligation to the supposed required action (or, in more fashionable words, how duties can be “agent-relative reasons for action”). In effect, I will present my approach on the concept of “reason for action,” influenced by Judith Jarvis Thomson’s approach, and her distinction between “duties” and “oughts. ” In the final section I will make some comments on the problem of relativism. I agree with Prinz that descriptive relativism is true; but Prinz is committed to a form of agent-relativism. I will present arguments against agent-relativism that depend on the acceptance of a clear distinction between “duty” and “ought. ”</p...|$|E
40|$|The archaeological {{research}} work, {{carried out}} during the spring campaigns in Ebla, and associated with the Archaeological Park project, answer the double need to perfect knowledge of contexts which have already been investigate, in terms of needs for conservation {{and in order to}} ensure the full visibility and long term maintenance of the main buildings which {{will be part of the}} tour for visitors to the city. These two simple methodological and theoretical rules, which were laid down consistently since the beginning of the first work on the field in 1997, are also a natural introduction to the interesting and unexpected results of the latest campaign in the central, south-eastern and south-western sectors of the renowned Royal Palace G. At the same time, they confirm – not that such confirmation is necessary – the extraordinary commitment which the «Italian Archaeological Mission in Syria» has shown in bringing together the professional and technical skills of young archaeologists, architects, topographers, restorers and students of what is known as the «Roman School of Oriental Archaeology». Concerning the first and certainly most important discovery, a series of indicators help us build hypotheses about the function of this small slot of two rooms, structurally added onto the Throne Room on the eastern sire. The discovery, in the small northern room, of 14 tablets and 2 splendid bullae, probably all located at a higher elevation – since none were found on the floor – indicate (as was said above) that one of the primary activities carried out there was, generally speaking, of a “complex” administrative nature: in fact, although the limited number of these documents can hardly make us see it as another small Archive, the presence of tablets and bullae together implies that at least two functions were carried out there: that of collecting documents and that of sealing goods. Also, the discovery on the floor of this room of one of the most extraordinary items of Early Bronze jewellery, unique in its kind and without any known comparison, on the one hand seems to confirm that the two rooms were used by important dignitaries; on the other hand, it could suggest – and an analysis of the texts would be decisive to this end – that in general the quality of the items kept there was very high, and high also the quality of the items which, before the famous sacking, were sealed there. Also, the semantic features of the two seal impressions which were found, though they have different techniques, style and articulation of the register, certainly cannot be referred to a common kind of sealing. One is more schematic and apparently represents a religious ceremony taking place in an aedicule; the other, plastic and with pretty relief style, takes us directly to the sphere of Early Bronze Syrian religiosity which always centres on the bull-man and on the lion. There seems to be no doubt that these very rich locations in the Throne Room of the Royal Palace G administered special items of great prestige, but it would be overreaching ourselves to say that these items were also the subject matter of administrative ratification, as the discovery of the small lot of written documents might lead us to <b>think.</b> <b>Actually,</b> their size, their firing, their state of preservation, the palaeography on them, advise us to pay a certain attention to the kind of transactions they regulated. In fact, if we were to assess them only on the basis of their physical and formal aspect, one might think of a kind of document which was not intended for long term conservation – unlike the well known documents housed in the main Archive – but were supposed to circulate easily, a sort of memo to provide an accurate record of the item administered. So if it seems impossible to recognize a direct association between the administration of the items found and the formal typological aspect of the written documentation, we must consider the small lot of documents independently. Certainly, the 14 tablets were not found by chance in the room, although it is likely that the room was not set aside to receive them as an archive; it is therefore reasonable to draw the hypothesis that the two rooms opened in the eastern sector of the Throne Room temporarily housed items of great value, and regulated some kind of official transaction which, before being filed in the archive, needed to undergo other kinds of approval, or – if this were not necessarily so – that the items were at least centrally controlled by those who had free access to these rooms. This new discovery in the Royal Palace G of Ebla, like others in the past, and in the recent past too, of Oriental archaeology, cannot be represented as a static function, and escapes any precise definition; however, with administrative deeds, we should not forget that before data are introduced into the places set aside for the conservation of their memory, research and consultation, the procedures followed natural steps, and this precious slot found in the Royal Palace G perhaps simply tells us about a location where one of these steps took place...|$|E

40|$|Satellite {{tracking}} of livestock Cue: For pastoralist communities, livestock {{are like a}} bank account ? the assets on which the community depends. But keeping a careful watch on livestock is not always easy. Many cattle herders brand their animals to leave a permanent, identifying mark on their skin. However, increasingly there are demands for cattle owners to have much more detailed information about their animals, especially {{if they wish to}} sell to foreign markets. In Botswana and Kenya a new technology is currently being tested that aims to provide herders with this detailed information they need. A pilot project, being implemented by a Kenya-based organisation called ERMIS (Environment Research Mapping and Information Systems in Africa), uses small computer chips which are swallowed by the cattle, and which act as an electronic identification system. Linked to satellite-based global positioning systems (GPS), the computer chips are able to keep a record of the animal?s movements. Julius Muchimi, Executive Director of ERMIS explained the benefits and some of the potential hazards of the new technology to Susanna Thorp. IN:		?The technology is actually being ? OUT:		? within the pastoral communities. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 43 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Julius Muchimi on a high tech approach to livestock identification and tracking, which could help to protect cattle and the grazing resources they depend on. Transcript Muchimi	The technology is actually being used in the livestock sector basically in terms of a livestock identification and also the trace back mechanism. And what is happening is that livestock are actually identified in terms of where they come from and then it also helps in terms of identifying how the animals move around pastoral areas and how they can also be traced back in case they are actually lost or in case they are stolen. So it is actually is able to have an identification number and it is also able to give information on where the animal is actually located or where it is at any specific time. Thorp	Now you mentioned the trace back system, this is actually for when you are exporting animals and the EU requirements now insist {{that you have to be}} able to know where that animal has come from and what it has been through in terms of treatments, that?s right isn?t it? Muchimi	Yes that is true because for the African countries to penetrate into the EU market then that is a requirement that the animal must be identified in terms of where it has come from and that is actually the key thing. In Botswana, we know Botswana is actually doing very well in the livestock market and in Kenya we are unable to penetrate the EU market but we are seeing that by taking that technology and using it within our livestock sector then we are going to have a niche within the European Market. So we are trying to advance the technology, one, to penetrate into the European Market and two, to be able to also retain and contain our livestock resources within our territories so that then we can bring down the issue of cattle rustling, stealing cattle within the country and also across the borders to other countries. So we want to retain our assets and we want to get our market niche. Thorp	What about with actually managing pastoral rangelands, I mean is there the potential to sort of see how the pastoralists are using the land and help them make the most so that they are not contributing to degradation issues? Muchimi	The technology is actually quite important in terms of resource allocation because you can know the number of animals that are within a given region, and you can actually be able to have a kind of a regional appropriation of pastoral resources like the grazing resources, where water is and also where pasture is. So you can actually be able to apportion, so that you have sustainable use of natural resources. So it is actually a technology that - well used - then it can also bring a lot of sustainability. And I <b>think</b> <b>actually</b> that is the strength in that you can allocate resources in an equitable way. Thorp	So it sounds like it could be quite successful but what challenges are there in using this technology? Muchimi	One is the issue of the cost. We have to really think is it really affordable by the community? The other thing is that can the community also be able to now take the technology further by using GPS and using the GIS software because the technology is actually moving. The question is, is it an appropriate technology that the community can use without external assistance? So the issue is actually sustainability of the technology. Thorp	But what about the information that is generated and who owns that information? I mean if you are using these very modern technologies and you are using a computer chip and you are linking it in with GPS, then there is the potential for other people to take that information and use it for other means? Muchimi	Yes that is actually a problem. If you look at the technology, it was invented for military purposes, monitoring your enemies or even remotely monitoring resources that are outside your territory. So when you bring this technology then you give your enemy a chance of knowing exactly where your assets are, where your animals are, and if they want to track it, it is actually very clear. They can actually use GIS and other systems to monitor actually where you are migrating to, where you are grazing your animals and also where you are also possibly going to sell. So they can intercept you. So it is a technology that needs a lot of care and we have to look at actually, are the communities secure by using this technology because it exposes them, it makes them vulnerable. Thorp	So, some good advantages, but some disadvantages that have to be taken into consideration. Do you see it as something that will be taken up more widespreadly? Muchimi	Yes because the benefits are more than even the threats. Many communities we would like to move forward because it is securing their livestock and it is also securing the environment, meaning the sustainability of the whole livestock production system within the pastoral communities.
