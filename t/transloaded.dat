50|$|At a break-of-gauge, cargo is <b>transloaded</b> from boxcars or covered {{goods wagons}} on one track to wagons on another track of a {{different}} rail gauge, or else containers are <b>transloaded</b> from flatcars on one track to flatcars on another track {{of a different}} gauge. Variable-gauge axles can eliminate this inconvenience.|$|E
50|$|The modern {{distinction}} between <b>transloading</b> and transshipment {{was not well}} codified {{in the period of}} the mid-19th through mid-20th centuries, when discussions of break of gauge often used the word transshipment for what today's careful usage would call <b>transloading,</b> or for any combination of <b>transloading</b> and transshipment.|$|R
50|$|<b>Transloading</b> {{is often}} {{combined}} with classification and routing facilities, since the latter often require handling of goods. <b>Transloading</b> may occur at railway sidings and break-of-gauge stations.|$|R
50|$|As of 2014 {{the only}} {{customer}} {{remaining on the}} line is a small <b>transload</b> operation near the CSX interchange. Included in the May 2014 North Carolina Freight Rail & Rail Crossing Safety Improvement Fund Projects budget is a $58,688 grant to construct more <b>transloading</b> tracks and expand this operation.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the final}} product (known within the {{industry}} as 'dryrock') is transported by rail to facilities along Tampa Bay, where they are <b>transloaded</b> onto ships destined for countries such as China.|$|E
5000|$|A shortline railway {{was built}} from Gypsumville {{to the shore}} of Lake Manitoba, where the gypsum was <b>transloaded</b> on to barges and shipped to a {{railhead}} on the Whitemud River at {{south end of the}} lake, near the present community of Westbourne.|$|E

50|$|The A&R Terminal Railroad is an American {{terminal}} railroad {{that serves}} Morris <b>Transload</b> of Morris, Illinois, United States. It {{is owned by}} A&R Logistics, and was incorporated on October 20, 2009. Its main commodity is transloadable products. ARE interchanges with CN just off the Morris <b>Transload</b> site which is off S Tabler Road in Morris, Illinois.|$|R

50|$|Passenger count {{increased}} in the following years, and tourism played an increasing role in the passenger count. Freight traffic also increased significantly. Until 1906, freight had to be <b>transloaded</b> in Cranzahl, since then transporter wagons made the extra cargo handling unnecessary. The biggest cargo customer - even until the mid-1990s - was the quarry in Hammerunterwiesenthal, requiring around 30 freight cars daily.|$|E
50|$|The line is most {{noted for}} the {{presence}} of heavy taconite unit trains. These trains originate in Kostomuksha, Russia, and terminate in Kokkola, Finland, where the ore is <b>transloaded</b> in to bulk ships. Previously taconite train also ran to Rautaruukki steel mill in Raahe, but this traffic ceased early in 2007, when Rautaruukki decided to order the taconite from LKAB in Sweden.|$|E
50|$|At Searsport, a Liberty ship <b>transloaded</b> over 350 tons of {{obsolete}} 1,000- and 500-pound aerial bombs into a newly constructed temporary wooden bin on {{the main}} deck. Out past the continental shelf - about one hundred fifty miles offshore with a minimum depth of 1,000 fathoms - these bombs were dumped along with 5,280 bazooka anti-tank rounds. At least four such bomb-dumping missions were made before the LST-519 was relieved by three other LSTs.|$|E

5000|$|The city of Brest {{is served}} by Brest-Tsentralny railway station. Because of the break-of-gauge at Brest, where the Russian broad gauge meets the European {{standard}} gauge, all passenger trains, coming from Poland, must have their bogies replaced here, to travel on across Belarus, and the freight must be <b>transloaded</b> from cars of one gauge to cars of another. Some {{of the land in}} the Brest rail yards remains contaminated {{as a result of the}} transshipment of radioactive materials here since Soviet days although cleanup operations have been taking place.|$|E

5000|$|The Danube is an {{international}} waterway, and thus landlocked Austria, Hungary, Moldova, Serbia, and Slovakia have secure access to the Black Sea (the same access is given to inland parts of Germany and Croatia, though Germany and Croatia are not landlocked). However, oceangoing ships cannot use the Danube, so cargo must be <b>transloaded</b> anyway, and many overseas imports into Austria and Hungary use land transport from Atlantic and Mediterranean ports. A similar situation exists for the Rhine river where Switzerland has boat access, but not oceangoing ships. Luxembourg has such through the Moselle, but Liechtenstein has no boat access, {{even though it is}} located along the Rhine, as the Rhine is not navigable that far upstream.|$|E
50|$|The {{facility}} is accessed from Highway 40 and would eventually also be reachable via Highway 6, which is {{planned to be}} extended to the area. Much of the hazardous waste transported to the site {{from the rest of}} the country reaches it via an Israel Railways rail line (a branch off of the main line to Beersheba) that terminates at a freight rail terminal located inside the industrial zone. Before the branch line was completed in 2004, hazardous materials bound for Ramat Hovav were <b>transloaded</b> onto trucks at the Be'er Sheva North Railway Station, a fact that delayed the approval of new real estate development in the vicinity of Be'er Sheva North due to the risk of hazardous materials spills occurring during the transloading process.|$|E

50|$|Investment by Reading Blue Mountain and Northern {{railroad}} {{spurred by}} Marcellus Shale company's natural gas exploration {{in the areas}} surrounding Duryea has transformed an antiquated, weed-ridden rail yard in Duryea, known as the Duryea Yard (and miscalled the 'Pittston yard' since only the yard approach wye is in Pittston), into a <b>transloading</b> terminal teeming with rail and trucking activity. The yard <b>transloads</b> sand from rail cars to trucks for use in Marcellus Shale gas drilling operations.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{improvements}} (2011) {{include an}} automobile <b>transload</b> facility and procurement of a genset switching locomotive to improve air quality by reducing emissions from yard operations.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>transloading</b> {{requires}} {{handling of}} the goods, it causes {{a higher risk of}} damage. Therefore, <b>transloading</b> facilities are designed with the intent of minimizing handling. Due to differing capacities of the different modes, the facilities typically require some storage facility, such as warehouses or rail yards. For bulk goods, specialized material handling and storage are typically provided (as, for example, in grain elevators). Intermodal transport limits handling by using standardized containers, which are handled as units and which also serve for storage if needed.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, the Alabama State Port Authority {{invested}} over $100 {{million to}} build a state-of-the-art transloading slab terminal on {{the southern tip of}} Pinto Island in Mobile Bay to service the inbound raw material slabs for the upriver carbon steel facility. Raw material slabs shipped to the Alabama facility from ThyssenKrupp CSA are <b>transloaded</b> from Panamax ships at the terminal onto shallow draft barges for transport upriver to the facility. The terminal is equipped with three wide-span gantry cranes with state-of-the-art magnetic lifting gear designed by ThyssenKrupp, and it utilizes RFID technology to read identifiers on each slab and provide up-to-date inventory records that include each slab's location and weight. The same magnetic technology is also used at ThyssenKrupp's Calvert facility. The terminal was necessary to Alabama's award of the project since the Tombigbee River depth and lack of turning basins prohibit deep draft ship navigation to the site in Calvert.|$|E
5000|$|Transloading may be {{confused}} with transshipment, but in modern usage they represent different concepts. Transloading concerns the mechanics of transport, while transshipment is essentially a legal term addressing how the shipment originates and is destined. Consider a load of grain that is <b>transloaded</b> at an elevator, where it is combined with grain from other farms and thus leaves on the train as a distinct shipment from that in which it arrived. It thus cannot {{be said to be}} transshipped. Or consider a package shipped through a package delivery service or the mails: it may change shipping mode several times along the trip, but since it is (from an external point of view) conveyed as a single shipment regardless of how it is conveyed or what else travels with it on the legs of its journey, it is not considered to be transshipped. Conversely, a load on a truck can be taken in one (legal) shipment to an intermediate point and then to its ultimate destination without ever leaving the truck. If this is specified as two shipments, then the goods are transshipped, but no transloading has taken place.|$|E
40|$|The major hurdle to {{be cleared}} in active {{immunotherapy}} of cancer is the poor immunogenicity of cancer cells. In previous attempts to overcome this problem, whole tumor cells {{have been used as}} vaccines, either admixed with adjuvant(s) or genetically engineered to express nonself proteins or immunomodulatory factors before application. We have developed a novel approach to generate an immunogeneic, highly effective vaccine: major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-positive cancer cells are administered together with MHC class I-matched peptide ligands of foreign, nonself origin, generated by a procedure we term transloading. Murine tumor lines of the H 2 -Kd or the H 2 -Db haplotype, melanoma M- 3 and B 16 -F 10, respectively, as well as colon carcinoma CT- 26 (H 2 -Kd), were <b>transloaded</b> with MHC-matched influenza virus-derived peptides and applied as irradiated vaccines. Mice bearing a deposit of live M- 3 melanoma cells were efficiently cured by this treatment. In the CT- 26 colon carcinoma and the B 16 -F 10 melanoma, high efficacies were obtained against tumor challenge, suggesting the universal applicability of this new type of vaccine. With foreign peptide ligands adapted to the requirements of a desired MHC class I haplotype, this concept may be used for the treatment of human cancers...|$|E
40|$|The {{centralisation}} of the Mauritian sugar industry, {{resulting from}} the closing down of mills of lower crushing capacity, involved the re-organisation of cane transport {{and the establishment of}} <b>transloading</b> zones. Cost effective transport systems and operating conditions had therefore to be identified. Different systems comprising lorries, agricultural tractors and one haulage tractor operating at three existing <b>transloading</b> zones were assessed technically and economically. Most transport systems are characterised by low payload to tare weight and high power to payload ratios. Factors affecting the transport cycles were also studied. The waiting times recorded both at transloadingzones and mill yards were found to be of crucial importance. Their impact on costs predominated over technical aspects. Transport systems with 24 tonne payloadswere found to be the most cost effective. Night transportation was less costly, mainly because of significant reductions in down time.

50|$|Where trains {{encounter}} a different gauge, {{such as at}} the Spanish-French border or the Russian-Chinese one, the traditional solution has always been <b>transloading</b> (often called transshipment in discussions of break of gauge), that is, the transfer of passengers and freight to cars on the other system. When <b>transloading</b> from one gauge to another, chances are that the quantity of rolling stock on each gauge is unbalanced, leading to more idle rolling stock on one gauge than the other. This is obviously far from optimal, {{and a number of}} more efficient schemes have been devised.|$|R
