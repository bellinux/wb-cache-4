50|$|Although the Bracero Program {{ended in}} 1964, the {{migration}} of Mexican workers did not.

However, the <b>total</b> <b>allotment</b> of 120,000 in 1965 still was not enough to address the demand for visas from Mexico.

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of funds (97%) for Employment Service activities are allotted to states {{on the basis of}} each state's relative share of the following two factors: civilian labor force (CLF) and total unemployment.

The remaining 3% of total funding is distributed to states with civilian labor forces below 1 million and to states that need additional resources to carry out ES activities. Of the <b>total</b> <b>allotment</b> to states, 90% may be used for labor exchange services such as job search and placement assistance, labor market information, and referral to employers.

5000|$|The {{stated goal}} of the JTPA is to target an {{economically}} disadvantaged population for job training assistance. The funding allocation for the JTPA is determined using a formula that is outlined in Title II. One-third of the funding is allotted based on the relative number of unemployed individuals living in areas of substantial unemployment, one-third {{is based on the}} relative excess number of the unemployed, and one-third is based on the relative number of economically disadvantaged individuals. A final stipulation of JTPA is that no state is allowed to receive below a minimum of one quarter of one percent of the <b>total</b> <b>allotment.</b> The money is further divided within the state based on the same criteria. (8) Inconsistencies are likely due to political variables that influenced the formula at the time these policies were developed. These variables include the legislative power of a state’s own representatives, a state’s ability to influence voters of legislators in other states and executive branch interests. The results of the study conducted by Svorny clearly demonstrate the importance of a state’s political power in influencing the votes of representatives (8).|$|E

However, the allotment ratio has a clear and highly significant negative influence on the volatility of short-term rates. Repo Auctions; Interest Rate Targeting; Interest Rate Volatility...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCO 2 from {{coal-fired}} power generation accounts for 43 % {{of the total}} emissions in China. The Chinese government has constructed an emissions trading market, but the <b>total</b> <b>allotment</b> for the power industry is not be proposed. This raises some core issues in the emissions trading market, including how to set the total emissions level and how to distribute initial emissions rights. In this report, evolutionary game theory was adopted to set the total emissions control level based on the coordination between economy and environment in the development process. This coordination was expressed as the ratio between the reduction of electricity volume due to the reduction of one unit emissions and the increase of electricity volume due to the increase of one unit emissions. A swarm simulation model based on multi-agent game theory was proposed, and a simulation example was carried out. After the total emissions standard is set by the government, power companies can decide their price, sales and emissions volume as part of electricity market and emissions rights market. In this simulation, it was found that, with a decline of total emissions, total electricity volume is not monotonically decrease. The change of electricity volume is a dynamic process, in which the electricity volume declined initially, and then increased, decreased in the end. The rates of reduction and increase are different, which provides a scientific basis to set total emissions volume for the power industry...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the flexibility that the principals of Cumberland County Schools in Fayetteville, North Carolina preferred when implementing financial site-based decision-making in their schools. The current budget framework limits the principals to approximately three percent of the <b>total</b> <b>allotment</b> in which independent flexibility is permissible. To complete the research, the fund categories representing areas of educational functions and service in the school system chart of accounts were evaluated. Seventy-two principals in the Cumberland County Schools were asked to indicate by priority their desire to gain flexibility over budget categories from the chart of accounts that have the greatest potential for improving the learning process (50 principals participated). The principals represented elementary, middle, and high schools. ^ A three-phase process of data collection and analysis was incorporated in the study. First, an analytical hierarchy process was used to identify priorities of budget categories by the school principals. This format allowed for multiple criteria variables to be employed. Secondly, a survey instrument was used to obtain the principals 2 ̆ 7 views of financial site-based budgeting. The analysis of this data included determining the frequency with which the categories were selected. Finally, a random sampling of the 50 principals that participated in the two earlier phases were interviewed so that gaps in the data could be identified. ^ The findings indicated that principals in Cumberland County have a strong desire to gain control over the funds they feel will help them improve the learning process. The ABCs (Accountability and High Standards, The Basics and Maximum Local Control) reform movement in North Carolina is a vital step in preparing students for the twenty-first century and the principals agreed that financial flexibility should be an ingredient of this reform. The principals did not indicate a desire to revamp the school finance process, but desired to have more flexibility in the use of funds associated with instructional programs. It was determined that the category of employee salaries and benefits, which was the first choice of their top four priorities, was the one in which they had the least flexibility at the school level. The analysis of the data from the asses interviews revealed that, from this single intervention of budget decentralization believed they could make significant changes in their educational programs without adding additional funds to the educational budget. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{viviparous}} organisms, pregnant females typically {{experience an}} increase in body mass and body volume. In this study, the prediction that variation in reproductive traits among populations of viviparous organisms should be related to variation among populations in body shape was tested in the Pacific molly Poecilia butleri, a viviparous fish that inhabits western Mexico and northern Central America. Variation among 10 populations in four reproductive traits was examined: brood size, individual embryo mass, <b>total</b> reproductive <b>allotment</b> and degree of maternal provisioning of nutrients to developing embryos. Variation among these populations in body shape was also examined. Significant variation among populations was observed in both brood size and reproductive allotment but not in embryo mass or degree of maternal provisioning. Significant variation among populations was also observed in body shape. After correcting for female size, however, reproductive traits and body shape were not associated among populations. This suggests that selective pressures acting on reproduction do not necessarily affect morphology and vice versa. Several factors might contribute to this unexpected lack of association between reproductive traits and morphology...|$|R
