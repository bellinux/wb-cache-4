5|$|An X-ray of {{swallowed}} barium {{may be used}} {{to reveal}} <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> the esophagus, and the presence of any masses. The esophagus may also be imaged using a flexible camera inserted into the esophagus, in a procedure called an endoscopy. If an endoscopy is used on the stomach, the camera will also have to pass through the esophagus. During an endoscopy, a biopsy may be taken. If cancer of the esophagus is being investigated, other methods, including a CT scan, may also be used.|$|E
5|$|As a hominid brain, {{the human}} brain is {{substantially}} enlarged even {{in comparison to the}} brain of a typical monkey. The sequence of human evolution from Australopithecus (four million years ago) to Homo sapiens (modern man) was marked by a steady increase in brain size. As brain size increased, this altered <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> the skull, from about 600 cm3 in Homo habilis to an average of about 1520cm3 in Homo neanderthalensis. Differences in DNA, gene expression and gene–environment interactions help explain the differences between the function of {{the human brain}} and other primates.|$|E

5|$|Basil cultivars vary {{in several}} ways. Visually, <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> the leaves varies greatly, {{from the large}} lettuce-like leaves of the Mammoth basil and Lettuce leaf basil to the tiny leaves of the Dwarf bush basil. More practically, the {{fragrance}} of the basil varies due to the varying types and quantities of essential oils contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol (estragole), eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{distinctive}} feature of Deinonychus, the shape and curvature of the sickle claw varies between specimens. The type specimen described by Ostrom in 1969 has a strongly curved sickle claw, while a newer specimen described in 1976 had a claw with much weaker curvature, more similar in profile with the 'normal' claws on the remaining toes. Ostrom suggested that this difference in <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> the sickle claws {{could be due to}} individual, sexual, or age-related variation, but admitted he could not be sure.|$|E
5|$|The bovids show great {{variation}} {{in size and}} pelage colouration. Excepting some domesticated forms, all male bovids have two or more horns, and in many species females possess horns, too. <b>The</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> the horns vary greatly, but the basic structure is always one or more pairs of simple bony protrusions without branches, often having a spiral, twisted or fluted form, each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin.

5|$|The {{brothers}} hired external help {{to address}} {{two of their}} initial issues: art and audio. Jamie Churchman, a former colleague at Sidhe, oversaw the visual design for Mini Metro and {{also contributed to the}} game design. They approached American composer Disasterpeace to work on the game's audio. He developed a procedural audio system that would generate sounds based on events in the game. Each level in the game has a corresponding set of rhythms and sounds; the harmonic structure of these elements changes based on <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> the player's subways system. The audio was inspired by minimalism and the works of Philip Glass and Steve Reich.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{the human}} female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. In humans and other mammals, it develops from an outgrowth in the embryo called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a penis or a clitoris, depending on {{the presence or absence}} of the protein tdf, which is codified by a single gene on the Y chromosome. The clitoris is a complex structure, and its size and sensitivity can vary. The glans (head) of the human clitoris is roughly <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> a pea, and is estimated to have more than 8,000 sensory nerve endings.|$|E
5|$|The first {{high-resolution}} electron micrographs {{appeared in}} 1952, replacing the Janus Green stains as the preferred way of visualising the mitochondria.

40|$|Lunar samples {{have reduced}} coercive force, high values of R sub H (ratio of {{remanent}} coercive force to coercive force), and constriction in their magnetic hysteresis loops {{due to the}} presence of superparamagnetic and multidomain iron grains. The high R sub H values are also attributable to the magnetic shape effects of the iron grains. Spheres, cubes, and needles, as well as more irregular metal grains were observed. The coercive force values are quite meaningless unless <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> distributions are determined. The R sub H and the ratio of saturation remanence to saturation magnetization values can be considered characteristic of <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> modes of <b>the</b> ferromagnetic grains in a natural sample, and a classification of natural materials based on their hysteresis characteristics is presented with special reference to lunar samples...|$|R
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} characteristic of Pteranodon is its cranial crest. These crests consisted of skull bones (frontals) projecting upward and backward from the skull. <b>The</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> these crests varied {{due to a}} number of factors, including age, sex, and species. Male Pteranodon sternbergi, the older species of the two described to date (and sometimes placed in the distinct genus Geosternbergia), had a more vertical crest with a broad forward projection, while their descendants, Pteranodon longiceps, evolved a narrower, more backward-projecting crest. Females of both species were smaller and bore small, rounded crests. The crests were probably mainly display structures, though they may have had other functions as well.|$|E

The powerful techniques developed by life sciences are becoming the basis of engineering approaches towards nanomaterials, opening a wide range of applications far beyond biology and medicine.|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound of {{the thyroid}} {{may be used}} to reveal whether {{structures}} are solid or filled with fluid, helping to differentiate between nodules and goitres and cysts. It may also help differentiate between malignant and benign lesions. A fine needle aspiration biopsy may be taken concurrently of thyroid tissue to determine the nature of a lesion. These biopsies are then sent for histopathology and cytology. When further imaging is required, a radiolabelled iodine-123 or technetium-99 uptake scan may take place. This can determine <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> lesions, reveal whether nodules or goitres are metabolically active, and reveal and monitor sites of thyroid disease or cancer deposits outside the thyroid.|$|E

5|$|Around 120,000 {{species of}} fungi have been {{described}} by taxonomists, but the global biodiversity of the fungus kingdom is not fully understood. A 2017 estimate suggests there may be between 2.2 and 3.8 million species. In mycology, species have historically been distinguished {{by a variety of}} methods and concepts. Classification based on morphological characteristics, such as <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> spores or fruiting structures, has traditionally dominated fungal taxonomy. Species may also be distinguished by their biochemical and physiological characteristics, such as their ability to metabolize certain biochemicals, or their reaction to chemical tests. The biological species concept discriminates species based on their ability to mate. The application of molecular tools, such as DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, to study diversity has greatly enhanced the resolution and added robustness to estimates of genetic diversity within various taxonomic groups.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the orbits}} of the Haumean moons appear almost exactly edge-on from Earth, with Namaka having {{periodically}} occulted Haumea from 2009 to 2011. Observation of such transits would provide precise information on <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> Haumea and its moons, as happened in the late 1980s with Pluto and Charon. The tiny change in brightness of the system during these occultations required at least a medium-aperture professional telescope for detection. Hiʻiaka last occulted Haumea in 1999, {{a few years before}} its discovery, and will not do so again for some 130 years. However, in a situation unique among regular satellites, the great torquing of Namaka's orbit by Hiʻiaka preserved the viewing angle of Namaka–Haumea transits for several more years.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, bite {{marks on}} two fragmentary gastralia of the holotype {{specimen}} {{of the large}} ornithomimosaur Deinocheirus mirificus were reported. <b>The</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> the bite marks match the teeth of Tarbosaurus, the largest known predator from the Nemegt Formation.

The bite marks probably represent feeding behavior instead of aggression between the species, {{and the fact that}} bite marks were not found elsewhere on the body indicates the predator focused on internal organs. Tarbosaurus bite marks have also been identified on hadrosaur and sauropod fossils, but theropod bite marks on bones of other theropods are very rare in the fossil record.|$|E
