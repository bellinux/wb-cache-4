25|$|On Wolsey's {{impeachment}} in 1529, {{the fate}} of Sandwell and the other suppressed houses became uncertain, although it seems that their restoration {{was not on the}} agenda. The properties reverted to the Crown and were not necessarily granted to the successor college, King's, which later became Christ Church, Oxford. Commissions of local landed gentry were set up in the counties affected to carry out inquisitions into the properties: those named in Staffordshire were Sir John Giffard, Sir Edward Aston, Edward Littleton and John Vernon. Once this work was done, Burbank and Cromwell travelled to Staffordshire and stayed five days at Sandwell in February 1530, selling off anything of value and raising £21. The bells of Sandwell they valued at £33 6s. 8d. - a sum <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> the same as bells at a number of other houses. Many of Sandwell's estates were passed on to the new college, but the Ellesborough estates and advowson went to Sheen Priory and St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.|$|E
500|$|Facing a {{difficult}} situation with war on two fronts, Simeon sent a peace proposal through admiral Eustathios to buy {{time to deal with}} the Magyar menace, promising to return the Byzantine captives. Leo VI gladly complied, ordered Eustathios and Nikephoros Phokas to retreat and sent the diplomat Leo Choirosphaktes to Bulgaria to negotiate the terms. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> what Simeon I had aimed. Leo Choirosphaktes was detained in one fortress and was repeatedly refused an audience. Instead, Simeon I exchanged letters with him, protracting the negotiations, showing suspicions over the wording of the Byzantine proposals, constantly seeking clarifications and adding new demands. The main issue was the exchange of the captives— the Byzantine priority was to free the prisoners captured during the Bulgarian campaign of 894. In one of his letters to Choirosphaktes Simeon I demonstrated his diplomatic skills deriding the emperor: ...|$|E

Following the appearance, Love stated that he had received an email from Benioff offering him a part in the show, saying [...] "I broached the subject by sending them an email back saying 'Listen I don't know what your plans are for me but it would really mean a lot to me if I could have one of those trademark Game of Thrones gruesome death scenes, and they wrote back saying 'Actually Steve, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> what we had in mind for you.'" ...|$|E

While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized.

500|$|Cher has six tattoos. The Baltimore Sun {{called her}} the [...] "Ms. Original Rose Tattoo". She {{got her first}} tattoo in 1972. According to Sonny Bono, [...] "Calling her {{butterfly}} tattoos nothing was like ignoring a sandstorm in the Mojave. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> the effect Cher wanted to create. She liked {{to do things for}} the shock they created. She still does. She'll create some controversy and then tell her critics to stick it." [...] In the late 1990s, she began having laser treatments to remove her tattoos. The process was still underway in the 2000s. She commented, [...] "When I got tattooed, only bad girls did it: me and Janis Joplin and biker chicks. Now it doesn't mean anything. No one's surprised." [...] In 1992, Madame Tussauds wax museum honored Cher as one of the five [...] "most beautiful women of history" [...] by creating a life-size statue.

2500|$|When the Duke of Norfolk {{arrived at}} Berwick in January 1560, Mary of Guise's {{military}} advisor Jacques de la Brosse wrote to him {{saying he did}} not believe the rumour in Edinburgh that Norfolk was Elizabeth's lieutenant-general in Scotland, there to attack the French and favour the rebels, against the peace treaty. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> Norfolk's mission. Norfolk remained at Berwick, instructed that Grey of Wilton was to have charge of [...] "martial affairs" [...] in Scotland, as Grey himself wished, while Ralph Sadler, a long-serving diplomat, was to forward a peaceable settlement with Mary of Guise by diplomacy, liaising with the Duke of Châtellerault and his party. Elizabeth had appointed James Croft to be Grey of Wilton's deputy. In turn, Ralph Sadler was given Grey's border administrative roles at Berwick upon Tweed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, Charles Tart {{conducted}} an OBE experiment with a subject known as Miss Z for four nights {{in his sleep}} laboratory. The subject was attached to an EEG machine and a five-digit code was placed on a shelf above her bed. She did not claim to see {{the number on the}} first three nights but on fourth gave the number correctly. The psychologist James Alcock criticized the experiment for inadequate controls and questioned why the subject was not visually monitored by a video camera. Martin Gardner has written the experiment was not evidence for an OBE and suggested that whilst Tart was [...] "snoring behind the window, Miss Z simply stood up in bed, without detaching the electrodes, and peeked." [...] Susan Blackmore wrote [...] "If Miss Z had tried to climb up, the brain-wave record would have showed a pattern of interference.

[...] The first MiG zoomed away and I engaged the afterburner to get in an attack position against this new enemy. [...] I reared up my aircraft in a 45 degree angle, inside his turn. [...] He was turning to the left, so I pulled the stick and barrel-rolled to the right. [...] Thanks to this maneuver, I found myself above him, half upside down. [...] I held it until the MiG finished his turn, calculating the time so that, if I could keep on turning behind him, I would get on his tail, with a deflection angle of 20 degrees, {{at a distance of}} 1,500 yards.

2500|$|During Saxon times {{land was}} {{described}} in both terms of its economic value {{and in terms of}} an absolute size. In the Domesday Book, the hide, an economic unit of measure was used, while there are references elsewhere relating to the furlong and to the rood that appear to be related to ploughing procedures. Of particular interest was the rood which was 15 [...] feet in length, the North German foot being equivalent to 335mm (13.2inches). Craftsmen, on the other hand used a shorter Roman foot. Some time between 1266 and 1303 the weights and measures of England were radically revised by a law known as the Composition of Yards and Perches (Compositio ulnarum et perticarum) often known as the Compositio for short. This law, attributed to either Henry III or his successor Edward I, instituted a new foot <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> [...] the length of the old foot, with corresponding reductions {{in the size of the}} yard, ell, inch, and barleycorn. Furlongs and rods, however, remained the same, but the rod changed from 15 old feet to 16 new feet.|$|E
2500|$|After {{playing a}} piano riff and singing the melody for Jimmy Jam, they {{recorded}} a rough vocal track. Jam stated, [...] "She sang me the melody, {{and then asked}} [...] "well, {{what do you think}} it needs?" [...] I said, Nothing. Go write some lyrics, it's fine," [...] adding, [...] "She had a bunch of different melodies, so we picked the two melodies that worked best." [...] Jam and Lewis chose to forego its production, deciding another producer should execute the song: [...] "We stay away from things we can't do. It's not like, 'We've got to do this, and it's got to be our way.' We're going for the best way." [...] Jam contacted Jellybean Johnson to develop the song with Jackson and help her produce it. Johnson recalled, [...] "She first played the groove for me on piano... I thought it would be cool if I could make Janet sound like a heavy metal queen. I knew the rest of them thought I was out of my mind, but I got a friend to play the guitars. I put toms and cymbals on it. Terry played bass and some sparse keyboards, and it was there." [...] In addition to Johnson, guitarist Dave Barry was asked to contribute after previously providing guitar on [...] "You Can Be Mine" [...] from Jackson's prior album. Barry stated, [...] "I wanted it to be authentic rock and roll. I rocked it out, then Janet and I got together to do the vocals. Janet is a very nice, warm person, and she was receptive to my ideas." [...] Jackson sang the song in an alternate tone, quickly adjusting her vocals in a single take. Johnson described, [...] "One night I told her I wanted her to sound like a rock and roll queen on it–she usually uses one of her other voices [...]. this, you wanted to be funky, but more rocked out. She did it in one or two takes." [...] Jam added, [...] "I tried to get her to sing a couple of the other vocals in her natural [...] with kind of an edge on it; she [...] didn't like the way her voice sounded, but for Black Cat, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> what was needed." ...|$|E
