Virginia Rohan of The Record said he liked Kyle's song and some of Kenny's antics, but said the episode was not as funny as The Spirit of Christmas shorts. Rohan said South Park [...] "can be brilliantly over the edge, but often <b>tonight,</b> <b>it</b> sorely needs a comic bungee cord".|$|E

"One Tree Hill" [...] {{was absent}} during the {{majority}} of the Zoo TV Tour, only appearing as an extended snippet at the end of [...] "One" [...] at both concerts in New Zealand in 1993. It did not appear again until 24November 2006 in Auckland, New Zealand, on the final leg of the Vertigo Tour. It was considered to close the concert, but tour designer Willie Williams voiced concern as it had not been performed in full since 1990.

500|$|A dance {{version of}} the song, mixed with {{fragments}} of the dance track [...] "Feels Like Home" [...] by Meck, was performed in the 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour {{as part of the}} rave segment. In the rave segment, Madonna appeared wearing a breastplate and a short wig. She danced energetically around the whole stage as backup singer Nicki Richards provided vocals during the intermediate solo. Screens displayed a message of equality of religions, as symbols and texts from different scriptures flashed by, including messages from the Bible, Qur'an, Torah and Talmud. Helen Brown from The Daily Telegraph declared the performance as {{one of the highlights of}} the tour, while Joey Guerra from Houston Chronicle compared Madonna rising on a platform with that of a superhero. The performance was included both in the CD and DVD of the live release of the tour, titled Sticky & Sweet Tour, filmed in Buenos Aires, Argentina from December 4–7, 2008. In January 2010, Madonna performed an acoustic {{version of the}} song live during the [...] telethon. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times commented: [...] "For 20 years, that song has been the symbol of one of the most tumultuous and controversial periods in Madonna's life. But for five minutes <b>tonight,</b> <b>it</b> was pure, put in service of something bigger than the singer." ...|$|E

The single was also intone at American late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! by B.o.B and Mars, {{who played the}} guitar, both backed up by a band, on May 13, 2010. Jayson Rodriguez said B.o.B was [...] "boisterous and energetic" [...] during the show. Becky Bain from Idolator, while commenting the Jimmy Kimmel Live! appearance, thought that despite Mars and B.o.B playing the track in several places, it still sounds [...] "lovely".

500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, {{the pilot was}} viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers. The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Diana Steenbergen of IGN, who was [...] "hooked right away", gave the pilot episode a score of 8.5 out of 10. She felt it began [...] "heartbreakingly", and the [...] "genuinely scary" [...] death scenes of Mary and Jess [...] "will haunt...the viewers". Steenbergen praised both the writers and the lead actors for making the [...] " [...] still feel natural, for the most part", and noted Ackles and Padalecki were [...] "instantly convincing as brothers". Also credited for this [...] "well paced" [...] episode was director David Nutter, who did an [...] "excellent job of setting up the atmosphere and tone of the series". Likewise, BuddyTV's Don Williams posited, [...] "It's {{about as good as}} a pilot can get." [...] He ranked it ninth out of his favorite episodes of the first three seasons, believing it introduces the characters [...] "in a memorable fashion" [...] and [...] "wonderfully" [...] establishes the show's universe. Robert Bianco of USA Today deemed the series as possibly [...] "the simplest and the scariest" [...] of the season's new dark shows, and wrote, [...] "It wants nothing more than to frighten you — and <b>tonight,</b> <b>it</b> does." [...] He noted the episode [...] " [...] off a few surprises" [...] and [...] "works its way to an ending that lives up to Dean's 'no chick-flick moments'". However, Bianco criticized the [...] "pauses for comic relief"; he felt Ackles' [...] "comic touch" [...] was [...] "not yet as skillful as it needs to be", with Ackles' attempts at being [...] "humorously annoying" [...] leaving him [...] "simply annoying". Despite the episode having a somewhat unoriginal villain and a [...] "relatively simple" [...] solution, Brian Lowry of Variety deemed the series' debut as [...] "a promising plunge into the darkness". Lowry applauded Ackles, who [...] "brings an easygoing charm and engaging wise-ass personality to the absurd notion of traveling the country with a trunk full of wooden stakes and holy water".|$|E

Senchenko used his superior reach to land jabs, and gained the upper hand as the fight progressed. In the ninth round, a left hook to the body sent Hatton to the floor. Knocked down {{by the type of}} punch previously viewed as his own signature, Hatton was counted out by the referee. It was the third time Hatton had been stopped, taking his overall record to 45 wins and 3 defeats.

Party Tonight (1983) – produced by Tony Visconti and released in the UK on the Ronco label – made a significant dent on the UK Albums Chart, cracking the Top-50 at No. 45. Mullins' vocals could also be heard – {{along with the rest of}} the band – across the radio waves, as jingles for the Radio 1 evening show were adapted from various Modern Romance hits. The single, [...] "Good Friday" [...] / [...] "Good Feelings" [...] was released simultaneously and reached the UK No. 96 position. Both Party Tonight and Good Friday shared the same cover art, a photo still captured from the band's 1983 ITV advert for Party <b>Tonight.</b> <b>It</b> was around this time that band member John Du Prez went his own way and, taking stock of the poor success of the single Good Friday, Modern Romance decided it was time for a change in both image and music style.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, KYW-TV rebranded {{itself as}} KYW 3 after being known on-air as simply [...] "channel 3" [...] {{for most of}} its history (except for the Direct Connection era, when it was known as 3 For All). It also {{abandoned}} the longstanding Eyewitness News name after 26 years and experimented with giving each newscast a different name. The morning and noon news became Newsday, the 6 p.m. news as Newsbeat, and the 11 p.m. news as The News <b>Tonight.</b> <b>It</b> also started using a theme based on the five-note musical sounder of its radio sister, one of the top all-news stations in the country and the highest-rated radio station in Philadelphia {{for most of the last}} 40 years; indeed, their news director during this era was previously at KYW radio. Group W hoped to gain the trust of viewers who already associated KYW radio with high-quality news. However, neither of these fixes worked--mainly because of putting unknown anchors Bruce Hamilton (who had previously anchored in Orlando at WESH and WCPX, and after his stint here, returned to Florida at Jacksonville's WJXX and WJXT) and Jennifer Ward (previously of Toronto's CFTO-9) at the helm of the evening newscasts, while the more familiar personalities were relegated to weekends and mornings, and channel 3 stayed in the ratings basement. The experiment with different newscast names ended after almost three years in 1994, just before it became a CBS station, when the station began calling its newscasts KYW News 3, with familiar Philadelphia anchors Larry Kane (from rival WCAU-TV) and Stephanie Stahl (from Miami's WSVN) coming on board; Kane anchored the 11 p.m. broadcast solo, while Stahl anchored the 6PM report, first with Bruce Hamilton, then with Pittsburgh's Don Cannon (though due to potential confusion with a local radio DJ also named Don Cannon, he went under his birth name of Don Clark while at KYW; he left in 1998 for sister KDKA). The Eyewitness News name was restored in early 1998.|$|E
