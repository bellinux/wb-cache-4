5|$|For each vintage, the CIVC {{rated the}} villages of the area based {{on the quality of}} their grapes and vineyards. The rating was then used to {{determine}} <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>and</b> the percentage of the price that growers get. The Grand Cru rated vineyards received 100 percent rating which entitled the grower to 100% of the price. Premier Crus were vineyards with 90–99% ratings while Deuxième Crus received 80–89% ratings.|$|E

5|$|By 1894 two Manning Wardle {{locomotives}} were in use: Huddersfield, works number 616, built 1876, and Earl Temple, works number 1249, built 1894. Huddersfield {{was bought}} second-hand and {{had originally been}} named Prestwich. Earl Temple, later renamed Brill No.1, was identical to Huddersfield other than having a covered cab, and was bought new. The Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad could not afford <b>the</b> <b>price,</b> <b>and</b> thus Earl Temple was owned directly by the Earl and rented to the O Wotton No. 2, works number 1415, built 1899, was bought on 7 February 1899 to replace Huddersfield. All three were 0-6-0ST with inside cylinders. The decrepit Huddersfield was sold in 1901, {{and the other two}} Manning Wardle locomotives were sold in 1909.|$|E

Moreover, we prove that the measure is the minimum of the measures of efficiency in all frictionless markets where <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> payoffs lie between the bid <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ask <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> payoffs respectively. In particular, we fmd that the model is arbitrage-free {{if and only if}} there exist convex combinations of the bid <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ask <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> payoffs such that the corresponding frictionless model is arbitrage-free...|$|R

5|$|Seeking {{alternatives}} to the difficult-to-work copper-nickel alloy, in June 1867 Longacre proposed that the five-cent piece be struck in aluminum. The new Mint director, Henry Linderman, objected to the proposal, stating that <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>and</b> supply of aluminum were as yet uncertain, and that the metal was too expensive to use in a minor coin. Numismatic historian Don Taxay, in his history of the United States Mint and its coins, noted that Linderman had proposed legislation increasing the proportion of nickel in the alloy to a third despite having earlier opposed the use of nickel in coins. Taxay suggested that Linderman was most likely influenced by Wharton and the metal's other advocates.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>price</b> <b>and</b> {{value of}} a Zimbabwean {{banknote}} depend on various factors: the rarity, based on {{factors such as the}} name of capital city, how long it was printed, or the type of watermark; its condition, and the national situation at time of issue, such as shortages or hyperinflation. Common designs and variants such as the $100 note of 1995 (Pick no. 9) are usually valued at about $1 apiece, while rare varieties such as the $10 Salisbury error note (Pick no. 3b) and the Standard Chartered issues are valued at around $100 or more. Zimbabwean banknotes are usually sold by banknote dealers over the counter or on the internet, although the most valued types theoretically qualify for inclusion in auction.|$|E

5|$|Gernsback {{experimented with}} <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>and</b> format, {{looking for a}} {{profitable}} combination. Both Air Wonder and Science Wonder were bedsheet-sized (8.5 × 11.75 in, or 216 × 298mm) and priced at 25cents, as were the first issues of Wonder Stories. With the November 1930 issue Wonder Stories changed to pulp format, 6.75 × 9.9 in (171 × 251mm). It reverted to bedsheet after a year, and then in November 1933 became a pulp magazine for good. The pulp issues all had 144pages; the bedsheet issues generally had 96pages, though five issues from November 1932 to March 1933 had only 64pages. Those five issues coincided with a price cut to 15cents, which was reversed with the April 1933 issue. Gernsback cut the price to 15cents again from June 1935 until the sale to Beacon Publications in 1936, though this time he did not reduce the page count. The short duration of these price cuts suggests Gernsback rapidly realized that the additional circulation they gained him cost too much in lost revenue. Under Beacon Publications Thrilling Wonder remained pulp-sized throughout.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{transform}} method to compute <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> greeks of barrier options driven by a class of Levy processes. We derive analytical expressions for the Laplace transforms in time of <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> sensitivities of single barrier options in an exponential Levy model with hyper-exponential jumps. Inversion of these single Laplace transform yields rapid, accurate results. These results are employed to construct an approximation of <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> sensitivities of barrier options in exponential generalised hyper-exponential (GHE) Levy models. The latter class includes many of the Levy models employed in quantitative finance such as the variance gamma (VG), KoBoL, generalised hyperbolic, and the normal inverse Gaussian (NIG) models. Convergence of <b>the</b> approximating <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> sensitivities is proved. To provide a numerical illustration, this transform approach is compared with Monte Carlo simulation in the cases that the driving process is a VG and a NIG Levy process. Parameters are calibrated to Stoxx 50 E call options. ...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{both large}} {{financial}} and non-financial institutions use {{models for the}} term structure of interest rates for risk management <b>and</b> <b>pricing</b> purposes. This thesis focuses on these two important applications of term structure models. In the first part, the empirical performance of several term structure models for <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>and</b> risk management of bonds is investigated. The applications in this part focus on modelling international bond returns, <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> of bonds that are subject to default risk, {{and the role of}} transaction costs of bonds in testing term structure models. The second part of the thesis focuses on <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>and</b> hedging of interest rate derivatives. This part includes an analysis of the relevant number of term structure factors for <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>and</b> hedging of interest rate derivatives, and an empirical comparison of the recently developed market models. Finally, the benefits of combining interest rate data <b>and</b> derivative <b>price</b> data for estimating and testing term structure models are analyzed. ...|$|R
