Vivacity of composition and fertility were not at all in favor, frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was extended {{over a long period of}} time under the cold control of self-criticism.|$|E
5|$|Cec Linder as Felix Leiter: Bond's CIA liaison in the United States. Linder was {{the only}} actor {{actually}} on location in Miami. Linder's interpretation of Leiter {{was that of a}} somewhat older man than the way the character was played by Jack Lord in Dr. No; in reality, Linder was a year younger than Lord. According to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Lord demanded co-star billing, a bigger role and more money to reprise the Felix Leiter role in Goldfinger that led the producers <b>to</b> <b>recast</b> the role. At the last minute, Cec Linder switched roles with Austin Willis who played cards with Goldfinger.|$|E

5|$|The serial's {{production}} was beset by {{problems caused by}} industrial action taken by electricians at the BBC during filming.

The studio subsequently turned back to Blake Edwards, who was adamant not <b>to</b> <b>recast</b> the character, feeling certain {{that no one could}} adequately replace Sellers. In 1982 Edwards released Trail of the Pink Panther, which was composed entirely of deleted scenes from his past three Panther films. Frederick sued, claiming the use of the clips was a breach of contract; the court awarded her $1million ($ million today), plus 3.15 per cent of the film's profits and 1.36 per cent of its gross revenue.|$|E

O'Toole was committed to the television series The Huntress when Ettinger filmed the original pilot. Around the time the creators wanted <b>to</b> <b>recast</b> Martha Kent when The Huntress was canceled, allowing O'Toole to join the cast. The actress had played Lana Lang in Superman III.|$|E
5|$|For the sequel, Mane, McDowell, Taylor-Compton, Harris, Moon Zombie, and Dourif {{returned}} to the roles of Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, Deborah Myers, and Sheriff Brackett, respectively. Daeg Faerch, who portrayed a young Michael Myers in the 2007 remake, was set to reprise his role for Halloween II. By the time production was getting started for the sequel Faerch had grown {{too big for the}} part. Zombie had <b>to</b> <b>recast</b> the role, much to his own dismay, because Faerch's physical maturity did not fit what was in the script. Although Faerch is not in the sequel, the first trailer for Halloween II contained images of Faerch. Zombie pointed out that those images were test shots done and were not intended to be in either the trailer or the film.|$|E
40|$|Although {{a number}} of studies have {{associated}} recasts with second language development, the actual mechanisms by which <b>recasts</b> work <b>to</b> impact learning are still little understood. In particular, researchers have sought to gain a deeper understanding of the connections among <b>recasts,</b> learners' responses <b>to</b> <b>recasts,</b> and subsequent development. To this end, the current study examines the impact of recasts and different types of responses on English as a second language (ESL) question development. In a pretest/posttest design, 58 Thai English as a foreign language university students carried out a series of communicative tasks with native English speakers and completed four tests over a 9 -week period. The learners' treatment task data were analyzed for the occurrence of <b>recasts</b> and responses <b>to</b> <b>recasts</b> that targeted developmentally advanced question forms. Their test data were examined for evidence of advancement to a higher stage in the developmental sequence for question formation. Results indicate that recasts were a significant predictor of ESL question development. Learners' responses in the form of primed production of the question forms targeted in the recasts were also predictive of ESL question development, but responses in the form of immediate repetitions of recasts were not associated with development...|$|R

5|$|Lynch {{conceived}} South of Nowhere {{from the}} idea of a teenager's coming out after hearing that his friend's son had come out to his parents. Lynch pitched the premise to The N and was commissioned to write the pilot. After the casting process was complete, the episode was filmed in October 2004, but when the show was picked up for a full season, Lynch decided <b>to</b> <b>recast</b> many of the characters and the pilot was shot again in July 2005 with the new cast. The premiere of the episode was promoted with branded MetroCards that were handed out to teenagers in Manhattan. Generally, critics reviewed the pilot positively, particularly commending its treatment of current social issues; however, some critics found the show's introduction of these issues to be forced and inauthentic.|$|E
5|$|Two local founders, John Pass and John Stow, offered <b>to</b> <b>recast</b> the bell. Though {{they were}} inexperienced in bell casting, Pass had headed the Mount Holly Iron Foundry in {{neighboring}} New Jersey and came from Malta, {{which had a}} tradition of bell casting. Stow, on the other hand, was only four years out of his apprenticeship as a brass founder. At Stow's foundry on Second Street, the bell was broken into small pieces, melted down, and cast into a new bell. The two founders decided that the metal was too brittle, and augmented the bell metal by about ten percent, using copper. The bell was ready in March 1753, and Norris reported that the lettering (which included the founders' names and the year) was even clearer on the new bell than on the old.|$|E

40|$|First-order logic {{provides}} {{a powerful and}} flexible mechanism for representing natural language semantics. However, it {{is an open question}} of how best to integrate it with uncertain, probabilistic knowledge, for example regarding word meaning. This paper describes the first steps of an approach <b>to</b> <b>recasting</b> first-order semantics into the probabilistic models that are part of Statistical Relational AI. Specifically, we show how Discourse Representation Structures can be combined with distributional models for word meaning inside a Markov Logic Network and used to successfully perform inferences that take advantage of logical concepts such as factivity as well as probabilistic information on word meaning in context. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{partially}} replicates that of Braidi (2002). Like the original, it investigates occurrences {{and use of}} recasts, that is, reformulations of incorrect utterances, {{in relation}} to the number of grammatical errors in conversations of NSEs (Native Speakers of English) and NNSEs (Nonnative Speakers of English) and examines whether different types of tasks can affect the occurrences and use of <b>recasts.</b> In contrast <b>to</b> many previous studies, I examine here the occurrences of recasts in non-instructional interactions between NSEs and NNSEs.;Five dyads of American teaching assistants and Korean graduate students at Iowa State University participated in performing two different types of tasks, a picture description and a spot-the-difference task. Their performances were audio/video recorded and transcribed with Transana 2. 0, a transcription software program.;For data analysis, frequency of recasts was counted and NNSE responses <b>to</b> <b>recasts</b> were also counted, according to the classification of Braidi (2002) and a chi-square test and a Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s exact test were used to find statistical significance. The results showed similarities to those of Braidi 2 ̆ 7 s (2002) study in that recasts occurred less than non-recasts in the frequencies of recasts predicted by the level of grammaticality. However, in contrast to Braidi 2 ̆ 7 s result showing a significant relationship between the level of grammaticality and occurrences of recasts, this study showed non-significant relationship between them. Furthermore, it appears that task types did not affect the occurrence of recasts. However, the study reveals considerable variation between dyads regarding both the occurrences of recasts and NNSE responses <b>to</b> <b>recasts...</b>|$|R
