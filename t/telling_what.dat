Carretta interpreted these anomalies as possible evidence that Equiano had made up the account of his African origins, and adopted material from others. But, Paul Lovejoy, Alexander X. Byrd, and Douglas Chambers note how many general and specific details Carretta can document from sources that related to the slave trade in the 1750s as described by Equiano, including the voyages from Africa to Virginia, sale to Captain Michael Henry Pascal in 1754, and others. They conclude he was more likely <b>telling</b> <b>what</b> he understood as fact than creating a fictional account; his work is shaped as an autobiography.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the lyrics}} on Beating as One deal with melancholy emotions. The track [...] "Stockholm Syndrome", {{which is the first}} Yo La Tengo song sung by McNew, is about captives {{eventually}} expressing empathy toward their captors and vice versa. It was described by prominent music critic Robert Christgau as a [...] "simulated Neil Young ballad". The song [...] "Autumn Sweater", which is layered with complex rhythms and textures, explores themes of love and lack of communication, while [...] "Center of Gravity" [...] has been described as [...] "a simple lo-fi devotional love song". Beating as One also marks the debut of Kaplan's falsetto singing, which was said to blur the line between his voice and that of drummer Georgia Hubley. The album's title is taken from a line in an unknown film. According to Kaplan, [...] "I think it's a nice, evocative title—it seems to mean a lot but it doesn't really mean anything. It comes from a movie, but I'm not <b>telling</b> <b>what</b> movie. You'll have to see it one day and say, 'Eureka!'" ...|$|E

500|$|The Confederate {{point of}} view for the battle was much {{different}} from the reports of the Union officers. Confederate General Jones reported [...] "The information I have is that the expedition started from Kanawha 1,200 or 1,300 strong, and that when it reached Fayetteville, on the return, it numbered but 500, only 300 of whom were mounted. The commander (Colonel Toland) and several other officers were killed, the second in command, Colonel Powell, and other officers wounded and captured. They admit a loss of more than 60 killed and wounded; it was probably much greater. Their dead bodies were scattered along the roads and mountain paths. [...] Our loss, as reported to me, was 1 captain and 5 men killed, and about double that number wounded." [...] The Reverend J. M. Wharey, who fought as a citizen of Wytheville during the raid, wrote [...] "...there was no <b>telling</b> <b>what</b> damage they would have done. Had Colonel Toland lived, the lead mines, the salt works, and the railroad bridges near Wytheville would have been at their mercy.

2500|$|Masterson {{was back}} in Dodge City on November 1, 1884, where he issued a small {{newspaper}} called Vox Populi, which was devoted to local political issues. Three days after its appearance, Bat received a flattering – and prophetic – review of his journalistic effort from another Dodge City paper which observed: [...] "We are in receipt of the first number of Vox Populi, W.B.

Diekmann discussed The Hulk's appearance in the 9/11 tribute comic Heroes, claiming that his greater prominence, alongside Captain America, aided in [...] "stressing the connection between anger and justified violence without having to depict anything more than a well-known and well-respected protagonist."

Then they entered the village.

Women who tried to protect their husbands were beaten.

Two widows of those executed on 29 September established close relations with the military commissioners from Bongo. This situation led to divisions that still exist in the community.|$|E
