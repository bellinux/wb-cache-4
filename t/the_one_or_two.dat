5|$|The Magnavox Odyssey is {{the first}} {{commercial}} home video game console. It was developed by a small team led by Ralph H. Baer at Sanders Associates and released by Magnavox in the United States in September 1972 and overseas the following year. The Odyssey consists of a white, black, and brown box which connects to a television set and two rectangular controllers attached by wires. It is capable of displaying three square dots on the screen in monochrome black and white, with differing behavior for the dots depending on the game played, and with no sound capabilities. Players place plastic overlays on the screen to create visuals, and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> players for each game control their dots with the three knobs and one button on the controller {{in accordance with the}} rules given for the game. The Odyssey console came packaged with dice, paper money, and other board game paraphernalia {{to go along with the}} games, and a peripheral controller—the first video game light gun—was sold separately.|$|E
5|$|The magpie is {{generally}} sedentary and territorial throughout its range, living in groups occupying a territory, or in flocks or fringe groups. A group may occupy {{and defend the}} same territory for many years. Much energy is spent defending a territory from intruders, particularly other magpies, and different behaviours are seen with different opponents. The sight of a raptor results in a rallying call by sentinel birds and subsequent coordinated mobbing of the intruder. Magpies place themselves {{either side of the}} bird of prey so that it will be attacked from behind should it strike a defender, and harass and drive the raptor to some distance beyond the territory. A group will use carolling as a signal to advertise ownership and warn off other magpies. In the negotiating display, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> dominant magpies parade along the border of the defended territory {{while the rest of the}} group stand back a little and look on. The leaders may fluff their feathers or caroll repeatedly. In a group strength display, employed if both the opposing and defending groups are of roughly equal numbers, all magpies will fly and form a row at the border of the territory. The defending group may also resort to an aerial display where the dominant magpies, or sometimes the whole group, swoop and dive while calling to warn an intruding magpie's group.|$|E

25|$|Mandragora is a {{plant genus}} {{belonging}} to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). Members of the genus are known as mandrakes. There are between three and five species in the genus. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> species found around the Mediterranean constitute the mandrake of ancient writers such as Dioscorides. Two or three further species are found eastwards into China. All are perennial herbaceous plants, with large tap-roots and leaves {{in the form of}} a rosette.

25|$|In graph theory, an ear of an {{undirected graph}} G is a path P {{where the two}} {{endpoints}} of the path may coincide, but where otherwise no repetition of edges or vertices is allowed, so every internal vertex of P has degree two in P. An ear decomposition of an undirected graph G is a partition of its set of edges into a sequence of ears, such that <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> endpoints of each ear belong to earlier ears in the sequence and such that the internal vertices of each ear {{do not belong to}} any earlier ear. Additionally, in most cases the first ear in the sequence must be a cycle. An open ear decomposition or a proper ear decomposition is an ear decomposition in which the two endpoints of each ear after the first are distinct from each other.|$|E

25|$|The {{main problem}} {{of the use of}} FISH to study the {{chromosomal}} constitution of embryos is the elevated mosaicism rate observed at the human preimplantation stage. A meta-analysis of more than 800 embryos came to the result that approximately 75% of preimplantation embryos are mosaic, of which approximately 60% are diploid–aneuploid mosaic and approximately 15% aneuploid mosaic. Li and co-workers found that 40% of the embryos diagnosed as aneuploid on day 3 turned out to have a euploid inner cell mass at day 6. Staessen and collaborators found that 17.5% of the embryos diagnosed as abnormal during PGS, and subjected to post-PGD reanalysis, were found to also contain normal cells, and 8.4% were found grossly normal. As a consequence, it has been questioned whether <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> cells studied from an embryo are actually representative of the complete embryo, and whether viable embryos are not being discarded due to the limitations of the technique.|$|E
25|$|The LCA's crew of four ratings {{included}} a Sternsheetsman, whose action station {{was at the}} stern to assist in lowering and raising the boat at the davits of the Landing Ship Infantry (LSI), a Bowman-gunner, whose action station was {{at the front of}} the boat to open and close the armoured doors, raise and lower the ramp, and operate <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> Lewis guns in the armoured gun shelter opposite the steering position, a stoker-mechanic responsible for the engine compartment, and a Coxswain who sat in the armoured steering shelter forward on the starboard side. Though in control of the rudders, the coxswain did not have direct control of the engines and gave instructions to the stoker through voicepipe and telegraph. The craft relayed signals and orders to the other two craft in the group by signal flags in the earlier part of the war, but by 1944 many of the boats had been fitted with two-way radios.|$|E

500|$|Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus {{wrote that}} the Magyars [...] "had of old their {{dwelling}} next to Chazaria, in the place called Levedia," [...] adding that [...] "a river Chidmas, also called Chingilous" [...] ran through this territory. The identification of <b>the</b> (<b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two)</b> rivers is uncertain. Porphyrogenitus associated Levedia with the whole territory dominated by the Magyars, but most modern historians agree that he only described a smaller region situated on the Don River. The period when the Magyars settled in Levedia is also uncertain; this happened either before 750 (István Fodor) or around 830 (Gyula Kristó). Porphyrogenitus said that the Magyars had been named [...] "Sabartoi asphaloi", [...] or [...] "steadfast Savarts", while staying in Levedia. Róna-Tas says the ethnonym is an invented term with no historical credibility. Based on the same denomination, Károly Czeglédy, Dezső Dümmerth, Victor Spinei, and other historians associated the Magyars either with the late 6th-century Sabirs or with the Suvar tribe of the Volga Bulgars.|$|E
500|$|Banksia aquilonia grows as a tall shrub {{or small}} tree up to [...] high, though plants up to [...] have been recorded. It has hard, fissured, grey bark, and narrow {{elliptic}} or [...] leaves measuring [...] long by [...] wide with [...] (straight) margins and acute tips. They are a smooth shiny green above and white below with a prominent [...] covered in red-brown hair. The brownish new growth appears in summer. The plant is in bloom from March to June. Flowers occur in Banksia characteristic vertical flower spike, an inflorescence {{made up of}} hundreds of pairs of flowers densely packed in a spiral around a woody axis. B.aquilonia flower spike is a pale yellow colour, roughly cylindrical, [...] high, and up to [...] in diameter. The tubular perianths of the individual flowers are [...] long. These open at maturity (anthesis) to release the styles. All old flower parts fall away as up to 50 oval follicles develop on the bare woody spike. The follicles measure [...] long, [...] high, and [...] wide. Furry at first, they become smooth with age and open when ripe, and their two half-oval valves split to release <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> seeds they contain. The [...] dark grey-brown to black seeds sandwich a woody separator. Measuring [...] long, they {{are made up of}} a wedge-shaped seed body, [...] long by [...] wide.

2500|$|According to one source, {{the wind}} {{gradient}} is not significant for sailboats {{when the wind}} is over 6 knots (because a wind speed of 10 knots at the surface corresponds to 15 knots at 300 meters, so the change in speed is negligible over {{the height of a}} sailboat's mast). [...] According to the same source, the wind increases steadily with height up to about 10 meters in 5 knot winds but less if there is less wind. That source states that in winds with average speeds of six knots or more, the change of speed with height is confined almost entirely to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> meters closest to the surface. [...] This is consistent with another source, which shows that the change in wind speed is very small for heights over 2 meters and with a statement by the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology according to which differences can be as little as 5% in unstable air.|$|E
2500|$|The Tidal Wave Pool: The first patron death {{occurred}} here in 1982; another visitor {{drowned in}} this common water-park attraction five years later. It was, however, {{the number of}} people the lifeguards saved from a similar fate that made this the only Waterworld attraction to gain its own nickname, [...] "The Grave Pool". It was [...] wide by [...] long and could hold 500 to 1,000 people. Waves were generated for 20 minutes at a time with 10-minute intervals between them, and could reach as much as 40inches (102cm) in height. It was not always obvious that pool depth increased as one got closer to the far end, and there were patrons who only remembered or realized that they could not swim when they were in over their heads and the waves were going full blast. Even those who could swim well did not realize that the waves, as fresh water, were not as buoyant as their ocean counterparts, and they sometimes exhausted themselves doing more swimming than they were ready for, causing patrons to crowd the side ladders as the waves began, leading to many accidents. Twelve lifeguards were on duty at all times, and on high-traffic weekends they were known to rescue as many as 30 people, compared to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> the average lifeguard might make in a typical season at a pool or lake.
