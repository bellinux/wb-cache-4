5|$|It was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> anything, so {{we carried}} our tent and baggage near the only {{house on the}} island, and began to cook our suppers, {{in order to be}} {{prepared}} for the earliest dawn, and to enjoy that which, from the conversation of the gentlemen we had, now raised the highest expectations of.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} called after 7 innings {{when it became}} <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the ball. An {{estimated}} 16,000 fans were in attendance to witness the hometown Browns go up three games to two in the best-of-seven series.|$|E
25|$|The Lobster Smack Inn {{saw many}} bare-knuckle fights in the 1850s, but few as {{dramatic}} as that between Tom 'the Brighton Boy' Sayers (1826–65) and Aaron Jones on 6 January 1857. The fight lasted for three hours and 65 rounds, and was finally declared a draw when it became <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Sayers won at the rematch a month later in London.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> now <b>to</b> <b>see</b> anything, {{and sitting}} on some old hay in the most {{sheltered}} {{corner of the building}} the five boys held a consultation.|$|R
60|$|Ussher {{looked very}} hard at Thady's face, but it was much <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> for him <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{anything}} that was there.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> {{for either}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the other's face; but each seemed very attentive, and to {{consider}} before speaking.|$|R
2500|$|Upon hearing {{their first}} hit single at age14, {{he became a}} great fan of The Beatles. He credits the band's 1963 song [...] "She Loves You" [...] for inspiring {{him to become a}} musician. He said in the 2011 {{documentary}} God Bless Ozzy Osbourne that [...] "as soon as [...] heard 'She Loves You' on the radio, [...] knew [...] wanted to be a rock star for the rest of [...] life". Osbourne left school at 15 and was employed as a construction site labourer, trainee plumber, apprentice toolmaker, car factory horn-tuner, and abattoir worker. He attempted to commit burglary, stealing a television (which fell on him during his getaway and had to be abandoned), a handful of baby clothes (originally thought to be adult clothes as it was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> when he committed the burglary, and which were stolen to sell to people at a pub), and some T-shirts. He spent six weeks in Winson Green Prison when he was unable to pay a fine after being found guilty of robbing a clothes shop; to teach his son a lesson, his father refused to pay the fine.|$|E
2500|$|After a British mine {{attack on}} 15 May, a German {{destructive}} bombardment {{on the ridge}} defences was accompanied by artillery registration (adjustments of aim by trial and error, directed by an observer in the air or on the ground) on the British communication trenches. In the five weeks before 21 May, the 25th Division (Major-General Beauchamp Doran) suffered [...] although the British miners were gradually gained an advantage over their German counterparts. The infantry thought that the Germans were going to attack but air reconnaissance found no signs of preparations. In the weeks before the German attack, the weather {{was so bad that}} reconnaissance flights over the ridge by the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) over the ridge had been possible on only ten days. Aircraft observers saw several new light railways, a supply dump; at one place new assembly trenches were observed. The last reconnaissance before the German attack was flown on 17 May; the crew flew over the German trenches from [...] but found that it was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> into them. British military intelligence took the view that the Germans lacked the infantry and artillery necessary for an attack and the transfer of divisions from the First, Second and Third armies to reinforce the Fourth Army continued.|$|E
60|$|Old Mother Laidinwool {{she waited}} on all day Until it come <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> an' people went away-- Until it come <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> an' lights began to show, An' old Mother Laidinwool she hadn't where to go.|$|E
60|$|She {{flashed a}} sharp glance at him, {{and he felt}} glad that it was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> for her <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his face.|$|R
60|$|Wilkins {{appeared}} a trifle uneasy, {{though it was}} <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> for Brooke <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him well, but he apparently {{made up his mind}} to speak.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Here's a store, mother--I {{need not}} go out,' said Hal, passing to a pile in the corner. 'It is <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> for thee <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Trying {{to record}} that thought, I noticed that my note-book was damp with dew. The cattle were lying down. It was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> 1911 ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, but {{not until}} Eustace had got away. He slipped out like a streak and disappeared. It was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> which way he went.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{it is not}} <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what it is, Pierre. It is a {{small white}} cross that some urchin has chalked on the door." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; {{it is late}} in {{the year}} to sit long out of doors: we ought to be off this ledge before it gets <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> let us <b>see</b> our footing. I daresay the horse is impatient.' ...|$|R
60|$|Before the {{sun rose}} {{he found himself in}} a thick wood where it was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> for him <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his path, and here he heard an owl crying as if it were in despair.|$|R
60|$|It {{was still}} freezing, and, though the stars shone, the trees grew so closely {{about the house}} that it was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> for me <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{more than a few}} feet in front of me.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her face, but {{my heart}} bounded with joy to catch in her voice a quaver that argued, methought, regret for me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a close look, {{and it was}} <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> much. But that Smith had a queer {{catch in}} his voice and this fellow had the same thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Leaping Horse and Hunting Dog will watch. Navahoes {{may come}} down here. Don't {{think they will}} be brave enough to enter cañon, <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Still, better watch." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{turned and}} stared at him, but he {{remained}} insensible to my astonishment, perhaps because it was now <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> for him <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it. [...] "Our women have no influence in public affairs," [...] I said, quietly, after a moment.|$|R
60|$|Thus they {{continued}} {{until the sun}} began to set. Then Gaff's heart sank within him, for he felt sure that, whenever it was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> for each <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the other, the madman would summon up courage to make a sudden attack.|$|R
60|$|Columbine {{encountered}} Jim Montana at the corrals, {{and it was}} not <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> for her <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his foam-lashed horse. Jim appeared non-committal, almost surly. But Columbine {{guessed that}} he had ridden to Kremmling and back in one day, on some order of Jack's.|$|R
60|$|A {{moment later}} Nigel stood {{among the group}} of men who had {{gathered}} round their captive. It was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him, and they dare not strike flint and steel.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> clearly, but Flora Schuyler {{realized}} with a painful fluttering of her heart and a great relief whose the white face outside the window must be.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> much, and {{he dropped}} on the couch. He was worried a good deal, yet he {{was not one to}} take {{anything}} too deeply to heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} reddleman abruptly. [...] "It is getting <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> for you <b>to</b> <b>see</b> much of her; and, more than that, I {{have no right}} to allow you. Thank God she sleeps so well: I hope she won't wake till she's home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{spectacles}} {{you want}} {{can be bought}} in London; but {{you will not be}} [...] able to use them at once, for they have not been worn for many years, [...] and they sadly want cleaning. This you {{will not be able to}} do [...] yourself in London, because it is <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> there <b>to</b> <b>see</b> well, and [...] because your fingers are not small enough to clean them properly. [...] Bring them here to me, and I will do it for you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he replied. [...] "I {{tucked it}} inside my shirt. They did not search {{me and it}} was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> for them <b>to</b> <b>see</b> whether I carried any weapons or not. So I hid it {{in the hope that}} I might get through with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not know, Alice," [...] he {{answered}} gravely, [...] "it is <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> so far, {{and it may}} have been but a shadow cast by the rising moon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{engage the}} {{cheapest}} and quickest passage to San Francisco," [...] said Randy. [...] "Let us look over those folders {{before it gets}} too late. It's <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> much outside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep back, {{unless you}} want to get shot!" [...] roared the man, and he raised {{something}} he held in his hand. It was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if it was a pistol.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> for me <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{the look}} of triumph {{on the faces of}} our captors; but I knew they wore such expressions, because of the cries of {{satisfaction}} and shouts of delight which burst from them when we, unarmed, stood in their midst.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess that}} is about it, Dave. Anyhow, we can push {{out as soon as}} it begins <b>to</b> get <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> for them <b>to</b> <b>see</b> us from the village across there--that is, as soon as the sun has gone down behind the hills to the south." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{becoming}} {{aware that she}} had not obscured the windows she came forward to do so, candle in hand.
