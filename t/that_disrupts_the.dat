In this type of annotation more emphasis is given to genetic variation <b>that</b> <b>disrupts</b> <b>the</b> protein function domain, protein-protein interaction and biological pathway. The non-coding region of genome contain many important regulatory elements including promoter, enhancer and insulator, any kind of change in this regulatory region can change the functionality of that protein. The mutation in DNA can change the RNA sequence and then influence the RNA secondary structure, RNA binding protein recognition and miRNA binding activity,.|$|E

2500|$|The two outer capsid proteins, VP2 and VP5, mediate {{attachment}} and penetration of BTV into the target cell. [...] The virus makes initial {{contact with the}} cell with VP2, triggering receptor-mediated endocytosis of the virus. [...] The low pH within the endosome then triggers BTV's membrane penetration protein VP5 to undergo a conformational change <b>that</b> <b>disrupts</b> <b>the</b> endosomal membrane. [...] Uncoating yields a transcriptionally active 470S core particle which is composed of two major proteins VP7 and VP3, and the three minor proteins VP1, VP4 and VP6 {{in addition to the}} dsRNA genome. There is no evidence that any trace of the outer capsid remains associated with these cores, as has been described for reovirus. The cores may be further uncoated to form 390S subcore particles that lack VP7, also in contrast to reovirus. Subviral particles are probably akin to cores derived in vitro from virions by physical or proteolytic treatments that remove the outer capsid and causes activation of the BTV transcriptase. In addition to the seven structural proteins, three non-structural (NS) proteins, NS1, NS2, NS3 (and a related NS3A) are synthesised in BTV-infected cells. Of these, NS3/NS3A is involved in the egress of the progeny virus. The two remaining non-structural proteins, NS1 and NS2, are produced at high levels in the cytoplasm and are believed to be involved in virus replication, assembly and morphogenesis.|$|E
