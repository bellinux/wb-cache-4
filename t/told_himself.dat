500|$|Barbree's {{most recent}} book, [...] "Live from Cape Canaveral: Covering the Space Race, from Sputnik to Today", was {{released}} on August 28, 2007, {{to coincide with the}} 50th anniversary of spaceflight, that began with the Sputnik 1 launch on October 4, 1957. The foreword is written by Tom Brokaw. Barbree's book attempts to illustrate how the media has changed in their coverage of the space programs, from the early enthusiasm to the relative disinterest in the program today. Barbree says he wrote the book because as he looked back over his career, when recalling all the people he'd worked with, very few were left. Barbree claims that he <b>told</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "You're {{the only one who has}} covered the whole program going all the way back to the beginning, and if you don't tell the story, who is going to do it?" [...] It received generally poor reviews from space historians.|$|E
500|$|Although {{both were}} {{committed}} O.T.O. members, Northrup's usurpation of Helen's role led to {{conflict between the}} two sisters. The reactions of Parsons and Helen towards Northrup were markedly different. Parsons told Helen to her face that he preferred Northrup sexually: [...] "This {{is a fact that}} I can do nothing about. I am better suited to her temperamentally – we get on well. Your character is superior. You are a greater person. I doubt that she would face what you have with me – or support me as well." [...] Some years later, addressing himself as [...] "You", Parsons <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> that his affair with Northrup (whom he called Betty) marked a key step in his growth as a practitioner of magick: [...] "Betty served to affect a transference from Helen at a critical period ... Your passion for Betty also gave you the magical force needed at the time, and the act of adultery tinged with incest, served as your magical confirmation in the law of Thelema." ...|$|E
500|$|Neil Milbert {{wrote that}} Secretariat [...] "ran {{what may have}} been the {{greatest}} horse race in history." [...] When asked about Secretariat's margin of victory, trainer Lucien Laurin stated: [...] "Naturally, not that big!" [...] He further commented on Sham's performance saying [...] "The horse we had to kill, we did." [...] My Gallant's jockey Angel Cordero, Jr. said Secretariat was [...] "just like a car." [...] Secretariat's jockey Ron Turcotte told the press that he saw the timer on the track hit 2:20 and he <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "Oh I can make it" [...] and continued to press Secretariat forward to break the course record. The UPI wrote that Secretariat's performance in the race put him in the ranks of the greatest race horses of all-time. Following the race, Secretariat was allowed several weeks rest before entering a few more competitions and then starting his a career as a stud, where he had been syndicated for close to $6.08 million. The 40th anniversary of the win was commemorated by the New York Racing Association in 2013 by placing a blue-and-white checkered pole at the Belmont track 253 feet, 2 inches from the finish line to mark the 31-length margin of victory.|$|E

500|$|According to Stevens, {{in one of}} {{his first}} games as head coach, he was nervous and [...] "felt like our team played on edge" [...] because of it. He decided that a team's play will reflect the mood of its coach; a calm coach means a team that will remain poised in {{difficult}} game situations, while a nervous coach means a team that plays on edge. [...] "I don’t want to lose a game because of my approach," [...] he <b>told</b> <b>himself.</b> Accordingly, he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games. He rarely raises his voice or gets emotional, instead quietly observing on the sideline with folded arms. He does not get upset about bad calls by referees or player mistakes, preferring to focus on [...] "the next play" [...] rather than what just happened. Butler player Willie Veasley explained Butler's 2010 Final Four run by saying, [...] "When those big runs [...] came, Coach called a timeout and said a few calm words. Then he said he believes in us, he loves us and we're going to win the game." [...] On the rare occasion Stevens feels the need to correct a player, he does it with [...] "positive reinforcement, just at a little louder decibel", according to former assistant coach Matthew Graves. Above all, Stevens wants his players to be confident, not living in fear of being yanked for making a bad play.|$|E
2500|$|Pius {{demanded that}} Marcus take up {{residence}} in the House of Tiberius, the imperial palace on the Palatine. Pius also made him take up the habits of his new station, the aulicum fastigium or [...] "pomp of the court", against Marcus' objections. Marcus would struggle to reconcile {{the life of the}} court with his philosophic yearnings. He <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> it was an attainable goal—"where life is possible, then it is possible to live the right life; life is possible in a palace, so it is possible to live the right life in a palace"—but he found it difficult nonetheless. He would criticize himself in the Meditations for [...] "abusing court life" [...] in front of company.|$|E
2500|$|On Thursday, October 11, 2007 Texas A {{officials}} {{issued a}} [...] "letter of admonishment" [...] and ordered that the website CoachFran.com be shut down. Additionally, Franchione {{was instructed to}} no longer employ [...] "any staff members that {{could be construed as}} representing Texas A or providing information or reports relative to his position as head coach at Texas A". Consequently, the university fired McKenzie. Byrne has been quoted as saying [...] "The Aggies are embarrassed right now. This has been a very unfortunate incident {{we do not want to}} experience again." [...] Byrne also stated that the incident would be included in Franchione's performance evaluation at the end of the season. The discovery of the newsletter led CBS Sports columnist Gregg Doyel to call for Franchione to be fired. Doyel wrote that many of Franchione's columns announced firings of assistant coaches before that assistant was <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> and reported injuries that weren't disclosed to the press. [...] More seriously, Doyel said, his disclosures of injury information violated federal health privacy law, and the entire venture would have also violated federal tax law if Franchione hadn't told the IRS about it. He also suggested that Franchione may have known the newsletter's recipients were using the information to make better-informed bets on Aggie games.|$|E

2500|$|At the time, Sparks {{had been}} {{wrapping}} up The Lucky One {{and beginning to}} ponder an original plot for his next book. The author <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> he could [...] "either go younger than 20 or older than 50", having recently written about every age in between. Wary of venturing above 50 again after his best-seller The Notebook, Sparks had already been leaning toward writing a teenage story when he {{received a phone call}} from Gibgot on behalf of the film in August 2008. Sparks recalled, [...] "Jennifer asked if I had anything laying around? I said no, but funny you should say that…" [...] Sparks returned with a premise by the end of July 2008. Once the proposal had been agreed upon by Cyrus, her family, and Offspring Entertainment, Sparks, with the aid of co-screenplay writer Jeff Van Wie, completed the screenplay before starting the book. Sparks explained that such an arrangement was necessary in order to accommodate filming in summer 2009, as Disney had scheduled, but that [...] "this is similar to the way it’s gone with movies based on my novels; it’s just out of order." [...] Sparks and Van Wie completed the first draft of the screenplay in December 2008, the first rewrite later that month, and the second and final rewrite in January 2009. Both rewrites took approximately one or two days, and Sparks found them relatively simple. The finished screenplay was approximately 100 pages long. While The Last Song is not the first screenplay Sparks has written, it is his first to be optioned for film. The novel was completed in June 2009, the same time shooting for the film began, and was published on September 8, 2009 by Grand Central Publishing. The plot of the film and novel remained secret throughout development.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the sixth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Isaac blessed Jacob, asking God {{to give him}} abundance, make peoples serve him, make him master over his brothers, curse those who cursed him, and bless those who blessed him. Just as Jacob left, Esau {{returned}} from the hunt, prepared a dish for Isaac, and asked Isaac for his blessing. Isaac asked who he was, and Esau {{said that it was}} he. Isaac trembled and asked who it was then who had served him, received his blessing, and now must remain blessed. Esau burst into sobbing, and asked Isaac to bless him too, but Isaac answered that Jacob had taken Esau's blessing with guile. Esau asked whether Jacob had been so named that he might supplant Esau twice, first taking his birthright and now his blessing. Esau asked Isaac whether he had not reserved a blessing for Esau, but Isaac answered that he had made Jacob master over him and sustained him with grain and wine, and asked what, then, he could still do for Esau. Esau wept and pressed Isaac to bless him, too, so Isaac blessed him to enjoy the fat of the earth and the dew of heaven, to live by his sword and to serve his brother, but also to break his yoke. Esau harbored a grudge against Jacob, and <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> that he would kill Jacob upon Isaac's death. When Esau's words reached Rebekah, she told Jacob to flee to Haran and her brother Laban and remain there until Esau's fury subsided and Rebekah fetched him from there, so that Rebekah would not lose both sons in one day. Rebekah told Isaac her disgust with the idea that Jacob might marry a Hittite woman, so Isaac sent for Jacob, blessed him, and instructed him not to take a Canaanite wife, but to go to Padan-aram and the house of Bethuel to take a wife from among Laban's daughters. And Isaac blessed Jacob with fertility and the blessing of Abraham, that he might possess the land that God had assigned to Abraham. The sixth reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
