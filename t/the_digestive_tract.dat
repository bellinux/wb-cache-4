5|$|Neptunium {{does not}} have a {{biological}} role, as it has a short half-life and occurs only in small traces naturally. Animal tests showed that it is not absorbed via <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> When injected it concentrates in the bones, from which it is slowly released.|$|E
5|$|A {{quarter of}} all people with Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} develop weakness of the breathing muscles leading to respiratory failure, the inability to breathe adequately to maintain healthy levels of oxygen and/or {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood. This life-threatening scenario is complicated by other medical problems such as pneumonia, severe infections, blood clots in the lungs and bleeding in <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> in 60% of those who require artificial ventilation.|$|E
5|$|In a study, eight addax antelopes {{on a diet}} {{of grass}} hay (Chloris gayana) were studied to {{determine}} the retention time of food from <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> It was found that food retention time was long, taken as an adaptation to a diet including {{a high proportion of}} slow fermenting grasses; while the long fluid retention time could be interpreted to be due to water-saving mechanisms with low water turnover and a roomy rumen.|$|E

5|$|Jaws allow fish {{to eat a}} {{wide variety}} of food, {{including}} plants and other organisms. Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the esophagus. In the stomach, food is further digested and, in many fish, processed in finger-shaped pouches called pyloric caeca, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients. Organs such as the liver and pancreas add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes breathe {{through two}} pairs of spiracles located ventrally on each segment near {{the base of the}} legs. Each opens into an {{internal}} pouch, and connects to a system of tracheae. The heart runs {{the entire length of the}} body, with an aorta stretching into the head. The excretory organs are {{two pairs of}} malpighian tubules, located near the mid-part of the gut. <b>The</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> is a simple tube with two pairs of salivary glands to help digest the food.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptomatic}} (determinate) chronic stage {{affects the}} nervous system, digestive system and heart. About two-thirds {{of people with}} chronic symptoms have cardiac damage, including dilated cardiomyopathy, which causes heart rhythm abnormalities and may result in sudden death. About one-third of patients go on to develop digestive system damage, resulting in dilation of <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> (megacolon and megaesophagus), accompanied by severe weight loss. Swallowing difficulties (secondary achalasia) {{may be the first}} symptom of digestive disturbances and may lead to malnutrition.|$|E
40|$|The diets of 72 rhynchoteuthion paralarvae of Illex argentinus (Catellanos, 1960) (1. 0 - 8. 0 mm ML) and {{two other}} ommastrephid squids from {{southern}} Brazil (28 ° 09 'S- 34 ° 20 'S) were investigated by examination of their <b>digestive</b> <b>tracts</b> and mucus covering. A great diversity of microorganisms was identified on the mucus cover, on the proboscis suckers and in <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tracts</b> of <b>the</b> rhynchoteuthions, including dinoflagellates, flagellates, ciliates, cysts and bacteria. Among <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tracts</b> of Illex argentinus rhynchoteuthions examined, 55. 6 % were empty, 9. 7 % contained unrecognizable food and 34. 7 % contained recognizable food, which included microorganisms on mucus as well as copepod appendages. Microorganisms on mucus were found mainly inside <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tracts</b> of small paralarvae, which also displayed high bacterial densities on their mucus cover. The presence of bacteria on the mucus cover and of mucus in <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tracts</b> decreased with increasing paralarval size. The smallest rhynchoteuthion with copepod appendages in its <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> was 3. 7 mm ML. These findings suggest that mucus enriched with microorganisms may be important in the diet of small rhynchoteuthions, and it is hypothesized that mucus could act as a substrate for microbial growth. The proboscis may {{play an important role}} in the ingestion of mucus...|$|R

5|$|Digestive tract telangiectasias may be {{identified}} on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach and {{first part of}} the small intestine). This procedure will typically only be undertaken if there is anemia that is more marked than expected by the severity of nosebleeds, or if there is evidence of severe bleeding (vomiting blood, black stools). If the number of lesions seen on endoscopy is unexpectedly low, the remainder of the small intestine may be examined with capsule endoscopy, in which the patient swallows a capsule-shaped device containing a miniature camera which transmits images of <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> to a portable digital recorder.|$|E
5|$|LACM 149371 is {{a poorly}} {{preserved}} molar-like tooth that largely lacks a recognizable enamel surface and shows many small grooves and holes on the crown surface. This suggests the tooth {{may have been}} chemically degraded, perhaps by acidic water or because it passed through <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> of a predator. The roots are broken off, but remaining pulp cavities suggest the presence of four main roots, which are partially joined into two pairs. A smaller pulp cavity between those roots suggests the likely presence of a fifth root and a slight depression in the tooth may represent another root.|$|E
5|$|Lactulose and {{lactitol}} are disaccharides {{that are}} not absorbed from <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> They are thought to decrease the generation of ammonia by bacteria, render the ammonia inabsorbable by converting it to ammonium (NH4+) ions, and increase transit of bowel content through the gut. Doses of 15-30ml are administered three times a day; the result is aimed to be 3–5 soft stools a day, or (in some settings) a stool pH of <6.0. Lactulose may also be given by enema, especially if encephalopathy is severe. More commonly, phosphate enemas are used. This may relieve constipation, one {{of the causes of}} encephalopathy, and increase bowel transit.|$|E

5|$|Radioactive {{substances}} can harm {{human health}} via (i) local skin contamination, (ii) internal exposure due to ingestion of radioactive isotopes, and (iii) external overexposure by β-activity and γ-radiation. Together with radium and transuranium elements, actinium {{is one of}} the most dangerous radioactive poisons with high specific α-activity. The most important feature of actinium is its ability to accumulate and remain in the surface layer of skeletons. At the initial stage of poisoning, actinium accumulates in the liver. Another danger of actinium is that it undergoes radioactive decay faster than being excreted. Adsorption from <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> is much smaller (~0.05%) for actinium than radium.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{symptoms}} {{are similar to}} other viral diseases such as influenza and the common cold: fever of at least , muscle pain, malaise, headache and prostration. As <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> is commonly involved, nausea and vomiting and backache often occur. The prodrome, or preeruptive stage, usually lasts 2–4 days. By days 12–15 the first visible lesions—small reddish spots called enanthem—appear on mucous membranes of the mouth, tongue, palate, and throat, and temperature falls to near normal. These lesions rapidly enlarge and rupture, releasing large amounts of virus into the saliva.|$|E
5|$|Video {{fluoroscopy}} uses {{x-ray radiation}} to produce moving {{pictures of the}} mouth during articulation or swallowing. It is considered the gold standard in studies of dysphagia because {{of its ability to}} take videos of the entire digestive tract during swallowing events. It is often used to study and treat aspiration of food, what parts of <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> are malfunctioning during swallowing, and positions in which swallowing is easiest. Only limited data is able to be collected as sessions are typically limited to three minutes due to the hazards of radiation exposure. and it does not allow for fine grain analysis of tongue movements.|$|E
50|$|Like other nematodes, M. ozzardi is a {{cylindrical}} and bilaterally symmetrical worm, with a pseudocoel, or a {{false body}} cavity.

5|$|A {{habitat is}} made up of {{physical}} factors such as soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity as well as biotic factors such as the availability of food and {{the presence or absence of}} predators. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss, and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tract,</b> or a single cell within the host's body.|$|E
5|$|In the Western world, about 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their {{gallbladder}} but the majority are unaware of this and have no symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of biliary colic (abdominal pain due {{to the passage of}} gallstones through the bile duct into <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tract),</b> and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and body mass index (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds have {{a simple}} stomach that is similar in {{structure}} to terrestrial carnivores. Most species have neither a cecum nor a clear demarcation between the small and large intestines; the large intestine is comparatively short and only slightly wider than the latter. Small intestine lengths range from 8 (California sea lion) to 25 times (elephant seal) the body length. The length of the intestine may be an adaptation to frequent deep diving, as the increased volume of <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> serves as an extended storage compartment for partially digested food during submersion. Pinnipeds {{do not have an}} appendix. As in most marine mammals, the kidneys are divided into small lobes and can effectively absorb water and filter out excess salt.|$|E
50|$|Some drugs, {{such as the}} prokinetic agents {{increase}} {{the speed with which}} a substance passes through the intestines. If a drug is present in <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tract's</b> absorption zone for less time its blood concentration will decrease.

5|$|The cone shaped fruiting body of Cyathus striatus {{makes use}} of a splash-cup {{mechanism}} to help disperse the spores. When a raindrop hits {{the interior of the}} cup with the optimal angle and velocity, the downward force of the water ejects the peridioles into the air. The force of ejection rips open the funiculus, releasing the tightly wound funicular cord. The hapteron attached {{to the end of the}} funiculus is adhesive, and when it contacts a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it; the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridioles degrade over time to eventually release the spores within, or they may be eaten by herbivorous animals and redeposited after passing through <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bile is {{produced}} by the liver, and serves to eliminate cholesterol and bilirubin from the body, as well as emulsifying of fats {{to make them more}} soluble in water and aid in their digestion. Bile is formed in the liver by hepatocytes (liver cells) and excreted into the common hepatic duct. Part of the bile is stored in the gall bladder because of back pressure (exerted by the sphincter of Oddi), and may be released at the time of digestion. The gallbladder also concentrates the bile by absorbing water and dissolved salts from it. All bile reaches the duodenum (first part of the small intestine) through the common bile duct and the ampulla of Vater. The sphincter of Oddi, located at the junction of the ampulla of Vater and the duodenum, is a circular muscle that controls the release of both bile and pancreatic secretions into <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b>|$|E
5|$|Copper {{enters the}} body through <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> A {{transporter}} protein on {{the cells of}} the small bowel, copper membrane transporter 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries copper inside the cells, where some is bound to metallothionein and part is carried by ATOX1 to an organelle known as the trans-Golgi network. Here, in response to rising concentrations of copper, an enzyme called ATP7A releases copper into the portal vein to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and metallothionein and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here it is ATP7B that links copper to ceruloplasmin and releases it into the bloodstream, as well as removing excess copper by secreting it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson's disease. Copper accumulates in the liver tissue; ceruloplasmin is still secreted, but in a form that lacks copper (termed apoceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in the bloodstream.|$|E
50|$|The Epsilonproteobacteria {{consist of}} few known genera, mainly the curved to spirilloid Wolinella spp., Helicobacter spp., and Campylobacter spp. Most {{of the known}} species inhabit <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> <b>tracts</b> of animals and serve as {{symbionts}} (Wolinella spp. in cattle) or pathogens (Helicobacter spp. in the stomach, Campylobacter spp. in the duodenum).|$|R
40|$|For many years, it was {{generally}} accepted {{that the vast majority}} of the colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) evolved from conventional adenomas, via the adenoma– carcinoma sequence. More recently, serrated colorectal polyps (hyperplastic polyps, sessile serrated polyps and traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs)) have emerged as an alternative pathway of colorectal carcinogenesis. It has been estimated that about 30 % of the CRC progress via the serrated pathway. Recently, TSAs were also detected in <b>the</b> upper <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> In this work, we review the literature on TSA in the oesophagus, the stomach, the duodenum, the pancreatic main duct and the gallbladder. The review indicated that 53. 4 % (n= 39) out of the 73 TSA of <b>the</b> upper <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> now in record showed a simultaneously growing invasive carcinoma. As a corollary, TSAs of <b>the</b> upper <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> are aggressive adenomas that should be radically excised, either endoscopically or surgically, to rule out the possibility of a synchronously growing invasive adenocarcinoma or to prevent cancer progression. The present findings substantiate a TSA pathway of carcinogenesis in <b>the</b> upper <b>digestive</b> <b>tract...</b>|$|R
