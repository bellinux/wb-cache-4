Through his own written work, it can be inferred that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development.

5|$|In Malaysian Bar v. Government of Malaysia (1987), the Supreme Court of Malaysia {{referred}} to the strict scrutiny approach but asserted that in reality it was not {{very different from the}} traditional rational nexus standard, which it then proceeded to apply. The Court's endorsement of strict scrutiny was much less ambiguous in Government of Malaysia v. V.R. Menon (1990). It held that the impugned Act was concerned with economic and social welfare and not fundamental rights, and therefore the trial judge had erred in applying a stricter standard of review. As such, the court implicitly endorsed <b>the</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strict scrutiny test in cases concerning fundamental rights in Malaysia.|$|E

Until Schmerber, the Supreme Court had not yet clarified whether state police officers must procure a search warrant before taking blood samples from criminal suspects.

5|$|The Court of Appeal {{rejected}} <b>the</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{subjective test}} {{in favour of}} the objective test on the following grounds.

Secretary of State for Home Affairs (1941), which were World War II cases from the United Kingdom. The House of Lords and the Privy Council had since recognized that the majority judgments in Liversidge and Greene had been wrong, and preferred Lord Atkin's dissenting judgment in Liversidge which advocated the objective approach.|$|E

These protections not only prohibit the government from passing laws which infringe upon these rights, but also from taking actions which would violate them. While the Bill of Rights—which includes the First Amendment—applied originally only to the federal government, the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment allowed for <b>the</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bill of Rights to the states under the incorporation doctrine.|$|E
