40|$|This is a {{essay about}} <b>the</b> <b>abortions</b> <b>debate</b> in <b>the</b> Swedish {{parliament}} in 1974. This paper sought {{to find out}} how the Swedish parliament talks about <b>abortion</b> and about <b>the</b> women that wanted one, by using the idea analysis and the analytical instrument subject positions. The result is that the Swedish parliament <b>debate</b> about <b>the</b> <b>abortion</b> talks about abortion i four different ways. First as a murder, secondly as a emergency measure, thirdly as a free right during the first 18 weeks of the pregnancy and lastly as something that should be completely up to the women.

40|$|Canadian and American {{abortion}} policy took suddenly divergent paths {{after their}} respective Supreme Court {{decisions on the}} constitutionality of abortion; Roe v. Wade and Morgentaler v. the Queen. The question guiding this research is therefore why, with similar interest groups and policy legacies, has abortion policy diverged in Canada and the United States since Morgentaler and Roe? The thesis seeks to uncover the institutional access and veto points in order to explain these recently divergent abortion policies. This thesis uses historical institutionalism to seek explanations for this policy divergence. This thesis uses the comparative method to flesh out institutional similarities and differences that account for divergent abortion policy development in Canada and the United States since the 1970 s. The comparative method used here involves the detailed analysis of Canadian and American abortion policy over time and the institutions influencing its development. The dependent variable is therefore <b>abortion</b> policy, while <b>the</b> independent variables are the institutional structures of the two states. The thesis concludes {{that because of the}} policy legacy created through Roe, and the permeability of the Republican Party by anti-abortion forces, <b>the</b> American <b>abortion</b> <b>debate</b> centers on judicial nominations and fierce Supreme Court battles. Conversely, <b>the</b> Canadian <b>abortion</b> <b>debate</b> continues along <b>the</b> same path, that of deference to the medical profession, as it did prior to Morgentaler.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{with this}} study is to locate discourses within the anti-abortion debate in Chile and analyze these.

Based upon what was encountered during research, two themes selected were The Right to Motherhood and The Right to Life. The two themes were analyzed from a power, gender, class, body and normative lifeline perspective. The conclusion was that <b>the</b> anti- <b>abortion</b> <b>debate</b> in Chile is strongly connected to the discourse on motherhood and the natural body. These two discourses show that the debate in Chile becomes stale and unprogressive while the idea that women only become real women through motherhood exist. Women have an obligation to become mothers in order to receive a higher position within the Chilean society as well as be regarded real women. The conclusion will show that motherhood is a cultural signifier in Chile, and an act where one perform one's gender. ...|$|R

[...] The view that abortion should in most or all circumstances be legal generally rests on the claims: (1) that women have a right to control what happens in and to their own bodies; (2) that abortion is a just exercise of this right; and (3) that the law should not criminalize just exercises of the right to control one's own body and its life-support functions.|$|E

In reaction, the feminist movement began studying pro-choice movements in France and the United States, to analyze how to direct the discourse in Mexico. In 1992 they formed the Grupo de Information en Reproduction Elegida (GIRE) (Information Group on Reproductive Choice).

It studies these debates {{from the perspective}} of human rights and democratic conceptualizations constructed within three main abortion discourses in Poland: the pro-life national-Catholic discourse; the pro-choice liberal individual discourse;and the pro-choice feminist discourse. The point of departure of this article is the observation that while all these positions have invoked human rights and democratic rhetoric with strong positive implications, they have also pursued radically different interpretations of human rights and democracy. This article argues that, in <b>the</b> Polish post-communist <b>abortion</b> context, universal notions of human rights and democracy have become extremely powerful political instruments for the articulation of particular interests and identities.
