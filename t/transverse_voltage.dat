2500|$|From 1971 to 1974 Henry William Wallace, a {{scientist}} at GE Aerospace was issued with three patents. Wallace used Dewitt's theory to develop an experimental apparatus for generating and detecting a secondary gravitational field, which he named the kinemassic field (now {{better known as the}} gravitomagnetic field). In his three patents, Wallace describes three different methods used for detection of the gravitomagnetic field – change in the motion of a body on a pivot, detection of a <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> in a semiconductor crystal, and a change in the specific heat of a crystal material having spin-aligned nuclei. There are no publicly available independent tests verifying Wallace's devices. Such an effect if any would be small. Referring to Wallace's patents, a New Scientist article in 1980 stated [...] "Although the Wallace patents were initially ignored as cranky, observers believe that his invention is now under serious but secret investigation by the military authorities in the USA. The military may now regret that the patents have already been granted and so are available for anyone to read." [...] A further reference to Wallace's patents occur in an electric propulsion study study prepared for the Astronautics Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base which states: [...] "The patents are written in a very believable style which include part numbers, sources for some components, and diagrams of data. Attempts were made to contact Wallace using patent addresses and other sources but he was not located nor is there a trace of what became of his work. The concept can be somewhat justified on general relativistic grounds since rotating frames of time varying fields are expected to emit gravitational waves." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{electric}} field {{can be applied}} to the crystal medium either longitudinally or transversely to the light beam. Longitudinal Pockels cells need transparent or ring electrodes. <b>Transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> requirements can be reduced by lengthening the crystal.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that this}} <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> does not {{necessarily}} relate to a real change in the particles energy, since magnetic fields are also able to deflect particles.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} simple equivalent circuits {{which enables}} calculation of expected values of <b>transverse</b> interference <b>voltages</b> on various secondary circuits at Substations. The <b>transverse</b> <b>voltages</b> appear {{only if there}} is an asymmetry in secondary circuits. They may cause damages of insulation or maloperation of protective devices.

40|$|A {{new theory}} is {{developed}} for the magnetoelectric (ME) coupling in a symmetric 2 - 2 ME laminate having a representative piezoelectric crystal (PMN-PT) particularly with anisotropic piezoelectric properties. Considering the average field method, the theoretical expressions for the <b>transverse</b> ME <b>voltage</b> coefficients at low and resonance frequencies were derived. The theory {{takes into account the}} anisotropic properties of the piezoelectric materials providing two different expressions of <b>transverse</b> ME <b>voltage</b> coefficients for different in-plane magnetic fields both at low and resonance frequencies. The numerical simulations show multiple resonance frequencies and phase differences between <b>transverse</b> ME <b>voltage</b> coefficients showing good agreement with the experimental results.

For mesoscopic structures characterized by device dimensions comparable to the energy diffusion length, the resulting thermopower strongly depends on details of the potential profile defined by electric gates. We discuss these mesoscopic features within a diffusion thermopower model and propose schemes to measure the energy diffusion length and its dependence on gate voltage...|$|R
50|$|The sample {{inhomogeneity}} {{might result}} in spurious sign of the Hall effect, even in ideal van der Pauw configuration of electrodes. For example, positive Hall effect was observed in evidently n-type semiconductors. Another source of artifact, in uniform materials, occurs when the sample's aspect ratio is not long enough: the full Hall voltage only develops {{far away from the}} current-introducing contacts, since at the contacts the <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> is shorted out to zero.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study Hall effect in pure and CNT doped YBCO {{polycrystalline}} samples, we have measured longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>voltages</b> at the different magnetic field (0 - 9 T) in the vortex state.

The contact geometry allowed simultaneous measurement of, both, the longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>voltages</b> with the current flowing between two injection contacts at the flake extremities. In both series of samples, from {{the sign of the}} Hall voltage, we found that the carriers were holes (in agreement with other results published on the C-face [13, 14]). The holes concentration ranged from 1 × 1012 to 1 × 1013 cm- 2 at low temperature, with a weak temperature dependence.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of thermal {{fluctuations}} in a fully frustrated Josephson junction array driven by a current I larger than the apparent critical current I_c(T). We calculate numerically {{the behavior of the}} chiral order parameter of Z_ 2 symmetry and the transverse helicity modulus (related to the U(1) symmetry) as a function of temperature. We find that the Z_ 2 transition occurs at a temperature T_{Z_ 2 }(I) which is lower than the temperature T_{U(1) }(I) for the U(1) transition. Both transitions could be observed experimentally from measurements of the longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>voltages.</b> Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} tunable transverse rectification in a density-modulated two-dimensional {{electron gas}} (2 DEG). The density modulation is induced by two surface gates, running in parallel along a narrow stripe of 2 DEG. A <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> {{in the direction of}} the density modulation is observed, i. e. perpendicular to the applied source-drain voltage. The polarity of the <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> is independent of the polarity of the source-drain voltage, demonstrating rectification in the device. We find that the <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> $U_{y}$ depends quadratically on the applied source-drain voltage and non-monotonically on the density modulation. The experimental results are discussed in the framework of a diffusion thermopower model. Comment: 8 pages, 9 figures, published in PR...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{dependence}} of the transport properties of square Josephson Junctions arrays with {{the direction of the}} applied dc current, both experimentally and numerically. We present computational simulations of current-voltage curves at finite temperatures for a single vortex in the array (Ha^ 2 /Φ_ 0 =f= 1 /L^ 2), and experimental measurements in 100 × 1000 arrays under a low magnetic field corresponding to f≈ 0. 02. We find that the <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> vanishes only in the directions of maximum symmetry of the square lattice: the [10] and [01] direction (parallel bias) and the [11] direction (diagonal bias). For orientations different than the symmetry directions, we find a finite <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> which depends strongly on the angle ϕ of the current. We find that vortex motion is pinned in the [10] direction (ϕ= 0), meaning that the voltage response is insensitive to small changes in the orientation of the current near ϕ= 0. We call this phenomenon orientational pinning. This leads to a finite transverse critical current for a bias at ϕ= 0 and to a <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> for a bias at ϕ= 0. On the other hand, for diagonal bias in the [11] direction the behavior is highly unstable against small variations of ϕ, leading to a rapid change from zero <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> to a large <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> within a few degrees. This last behavior is in good agreement with our measurements in arrays with a quasi-diagonal current drive. Comment: 9 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
40|$|We have {{observed}} a <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> on passing a current {{through a narrow}} channel, electrostatically defined in a two-dimensional electron gas, at zero magnetic field. The channel is fitted with two opposite guantum point contact voltage probes, and the voltage occurs when these probes are differently adjusted, so that the transmission probabilities through the probes have a different energy dependence. The <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> occurs only in the nonlinear response regime, and is even in the applied current; {{the driving force of}} the effect is the current-heating of the electrons in the channel. We observe strong oscillations in the <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> äs the number of occupied subbands in one of the voltage probes is varied by means of electrostatic or magnetic depopulation.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{electronic}} properties of AA-stacked bilayer graphene in a transverse electric field. The strong on-site Coulomb repulsion stabilizes the antiferromagnetic order {{in such a}} system. The antiferromagnetic order is suppressed by the <b>transverse</b> bias <b>voltage,</b> at least partially. The inter-plane Coulomb repulsion and non-zero voltage stabilize an exciton order parameter. The exciton order parameter coexists with the antiferromagnetism and can be as large as several tens of meV for realistic values of the bias voltage and interaction constants.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{simulations}} with the CUDI–CICC code on the poloidal field insert sample (PFIS) {{tested in the}} SULTAN test facility are presented. The interpretations are based on current distribution analysis from self-field measurements with Hall sensor arrays and current sharing measurements. The possible variation in voltage–current (VI) curves among the sub-cables in the PFIS caused by the cable self-field and joint non-uniformity is a principal issue {{for the evaluation of}} the strand-to-cable performance. The cable <b>transverse</b> <b>voltages,</b> initiated by current non-uniformity in a cabled conductor, can affect the shape of the longitudinal VI curve. The basic cable data are obtained by petal-to-conduit contact resistance and conduit resistivity measurements under transverse cyclic load in the Twente Cryogenic Cable Press. We assessed the impact of the conduit, the sub-cable resistive barrier wraps and the location of the voltage taps on the measured voltage, and some comparisons were carried out with experimental runs on the PFIS. The outcome confirms that the <b>transverse</b> <b>voltages,</b> caused by current redistribution, do affect the shape of the VI transition. This effect seems particularly important in short sample tests. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the location of the voltage taps can affect the experimentally obtained VI curve and solutions for most accurate measurement of the VI are discussed in the paper. The numerical model, CUDI–CICC covers the final cabling stage of inter-petal interactions only, by which the possible role of intra-petal non-uniformities is ignored, although recognized as potentially relevant. ...|$|R
40|$|Voltages {{parallel}} and {{transverse to}} electric current in slightly inhomogeneous superconductors can contain components {{proportional to the}} field and temperature derivatives of the longitudinal and Hall resistivities. We show that these anomalous contributions can be {{the origin of the}} zero field and even-in-field <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> occasionally observed at the superconductor to normal state transition. The same mechanism can also cause an anomaly in the odd-in-field <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> interfering the Hall effect signal. Comment: 6 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{predict that}} when an {{alternating}} voltage {{is applied to}} a semiconducting system with inhomogeneous electron density in the direction perpendicular to main current flow, the spin Hall effect results in a <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> containing a double-frequency component. We also demonstrate {{that there is a}} phase shift between applied and <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> oscillations, related to the general memristive behavior of semiconductor spintronic systems. A different method to achieve frequency doubling based on the inverse spin Hall effect is also discussed...|$|E

Essentially the Hall voltage is measured by detecting the induced birefringence created by this <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage.</b> The change in polarization of the probing beam is plotted {{as a function of}} the magnetic field which induces the Hall field.

Samples were prepared {{in the form}} of thin film and patterned into the usual Hall bar shape. In close vicinity of the critical temperature T_c non-zero transverse resistance has been observed. Its dependence on the transport current has been also studied. New scaling between transverse and longitudinal resistivities has been observed in the form ρ_xy∼ dρ_xx/dT. Several models for explanation of the observed transverse resistances and breaking of reciprocity theorem are discussed.

40|$|A {{technique}} for determination of room-temperature {{two-dimensional electron gas}} (2 DEG) concentration and mobility in heterostructures is presented. Using simultaneous fits of the longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>voltages</b> {{as a function of}} applied magnetic field, we were able to separate the parameters associated with the 2 DEG from those of the parallel layer. Comparison with the Shubnikov-de Haas data derived from measurements at liquid helium temperatures proves that the analysis of the room-temperature data provides an excellent estimate of the 2 DEG concentration. In addition we were able to obtain {{for the first time the}} room-temperature mobility of the 2 DEG, an important parameter to device application.

Even for temperature difference of 5 K the Planar Nernst Effect in ultrathin film (8 nm) shows a coercivity of 3 Oe same as observed in Planar Hall Effect measurement and confirms the ferromagnetic nature of thin film.

40|$|We present {{harmonic}} <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> {{measurements of}} current-induced thermoelectric and spin-orbit torque (SOT) effects in ferromagnet/normal metal bilayers, in which thermal gradients produced by Joule heating and SOT coexist and {{give rise to}} ac transverse signals with comparable symmetry and magnitude. Based on the symmetry and field-dependence of the transverse resistance, we develop a consistent method to separate thermoelectric and SOT measurements. By addressing first ferromagnet/light metal bilayers with negligible spin-orbit coupling, we show that in-plane current injection induces a vertical thermal gradient whose sign and magnitude {{are determined by the}} resistivity difference and stacking order of the magnetic and nonmagnetic layers. We then study ferromagnet/heavy metal bilayers with strong spin-orbit coupling, showing that second harmonic thermoelectric contributions to the <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> may lead to a significant overestimation of the antidamping SOT. We find that thermoelectric effects are very strong in Ta(6 nm) /Co(2. 5 nm) and negligible in Pt(6 nm) /Co(2. 5 nm) bilayers. After including these effects in the analysis of the <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage,</b> we find that the antidamping SOTs in these bilayers, after normalization to the magnetization volume, are comparable to those found in thinner Co layers with perpendicular magnetization, whereas the field-like SOTs are about an order of magnitude smaller.

40|$|Longitudinal and {{transverse}} voltages {{have been}} measured in zero external magnetic fields. In close {{vicinity of the}} superconducting transition nonzero <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> has been observed while far away from Tc, both above and below no such voltage has been detected.

Several models have been discussed taking into account also the penetration of self field due to the applied transport current. It seems that observed results can be explained using the Kosterlitz-Thouless model {{as a result of an}} unpairing of vortex-antivortex pairs created below Tkt due to fluctuations. At Tkt free vortices and antivortices are created and can contribute to a dissipation of energy.

Using an evolutionary algorithm guided by Pareto ranking methods, a crab cavity design can be optimised for <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> (V) while maintaining acceptable surface fields and the correct operating frequency. Evolutionary algorithms are an example of a parallel meta-heuristic search technique inspired by natural evolution. They allow complex, epistatic (non-linear) and multimodal (multiple optima and/or sub-optima) optimization problems to be efficiently explored. Using the concept of domination the solutions can be ordered into Pareto fronts.

40|$|The planned high {{luminosity}} {{upgrade to}} LHC will utilise crab cavities to rotate the beam {{in order to}} increase the luminosity {{in the presence of a}} finite crossing angle. A compact design is required in order for the cavities to fit between opposing beam-lines. In this paper we discuss we discuss one option for the LHC crab cavity based on a 4 rod TEM deflecting cavity. Due to the large transverse size of the LHC beam the cavity is required to have a large aperture while maintaining a constant <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> across the aperture. The cavity has been optimised to minimise the variation of the <b>transverse</b> <b>voltage</b> while keeping the peak surface electric and magnetic fields low for a given kick.

40|$|The spin Hall effect allows {{generation}} of spin current when charge current is passed along materials with large spin orbit coupling. It has been recently predicted that heat current in a non-magnetic metal {{can be converted}} into spin current via a process {{referred to as the}} spin Nernst effect. Here we report the observation of the spin Nernst effect in W. In W/CoFeB/MgO heterostructures, we find changes in the longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>voltages</b> with magnetic field when temperature gradient is applied across the film. The field-dependence of the voltage resembles that of the spin Hall magnetoresistance. A comparison of the temperature gradient induced voltage and the spin Hall magnetoresistance allows direct estimation of the spin Nernst angle. We find the spin Nernst angle of W to be similar in magnitude but opposite in sign with its spin Hall angle. Interestingly, under an open circuit condition, such sign difference results in spin current generation larger than otherwise. These results highlight the distinct characteristics of the spin Nernst and spin Hall effects, providing pathways to explore materials with unique band structures that may generate large spin current with high efficiency...|$|R
