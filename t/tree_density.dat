A total of 26 species of termites {{were present in the}} three sites, and 196 encounters were recorded in the transects. The termite assemblages were considerably different among sites, with a conspicuous reduction in both diversity and abundance with increased disturbance, related to the reduction of <b>tree</b> <b>density</b> and soil cover, and with the intensity of trampling by cattle and goats.

However, in many savannas, tree densities are higher and trees are more regularly spaced than in forests.

50|$|Vegetation on termite mounds usually differs highly from {{vegetation}} in the surrounding. In African savannas, Macrotermes mounds form 'islands' {{with high}} <b>tree</b> <b>densities.</b> This is usually {{attributed to the}} fact that due to the digging of termites and due to their decomposition of plant material, the mound soils are generally more fertile than other soil. On top of that, mound soils have been found to contain more water than their surroundings, a clear advantage for plant growth in savannas. Interestingly, the high <b>tree</b> <b>densities</b> on termite mounds attract high densities of browsing herbivores, due to the high nutrient contents in foliage from trees growing on mounds, or perhaps due to the high quantities of food and shelter on mounds.|$|R

30|$|In {{this context}} of {{increasing}} boma density {{and duration of}} use, bomas may lead to significant degradation of surrounding soils and plant communities. We have found that areas between two or more nearby glades (< 150 [*]m apart) are characterized by especially high <b>tree</b> <b>densities</b> and low wild herbivore use (Porensky 2011). This is likely due to a legacy of active boma use; the presence of cattle and humans during boma occupation may positively affect tree cover by reducing grass cover (and its competitive effects on trees) and browser presence, and by fertilizing areas between nearby bomas (L. M. Porensky unpublished data; Muchiru et al. 2009).

40|$|AbstractThe easy {{availability}} and {{widespread use of}} remotely-sensed imagery, especially Google Earth satellite imagery, makes it simple for urban forestry professionals to assess a site and measure <b>tree</b> cover <b>density</b> without visiting the site. Remotely-sensed <b>tree</b> cover <b>density</b> has become the dominant criterion for urban forestry regulations in many countries, but {{it is unclear how}} much such measures match the eye-level <b>tree</b> cover <b>density</b> that people experience; or the information gained through site visits, eye-level photography, or from consulting with citizens. To address this uncertainty, we assessed associations among two remotely-sensed and three eye-level <b>tree</b> cover <b>density</b> measures for 140 community street sites across the Midwestern United States with low, medium, or high tree cover coverage by using linear regression analysis. We found significant associations among the two remotely-sensed measures and the three eye-level measures across the three levels of tree cover. The associations between any pair of remotely-sensed and eye-level measures, however, diminish dramatically as canopy cover increased. At high levels of canopy cover, all associations between the remotely-sensed measures and the eye-level measures became statistically insignificant. These findings suggest that measures from remotely-sensed imagery fail to represent the amount of tree cover people perceive at eye-level when canopy cover is medium or high at the site scale. Therefore, the current urban forestry planning regulations, which rely heavily on remotely-sensed <b>tree</b> cover <b>density</b> measurements, need to be revised. We suggest strategic spots where eye-level measures of <b>tree</b> cover <b>density</b> should be emphasized...|$|R
