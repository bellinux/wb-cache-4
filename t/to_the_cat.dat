5|$|Bears, crocodiles, golden jackals, leopards {{and snakes}} {{are the main}} predators of the jungle cat. The golden jackal, particularly, can be a major {{competitor}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cat.</b> When it encounters a threat, the jungle cat will vocalise before engaging in attack, producing sounds like small roars – a behavior uncommon for {{the other members of}} Felis. The meow of the jungle cat is also somewhat lower than that of a typical domestic cat. The jungle cat can host parasites such as Haemaphysalis and Heterophyes species.|$|E
5|$|In 1634, another tale with a trickster cat as hero was {{published}} in Giambattista Basile's collection Pentamerone although neither the collection nor the tale were published in France during Perrault's lifetime. In Basile, the lad is a beggar boy called Gagliuso (sometimes Cagliuso) whose fortunes are achieved {{in a manner similar}} to Perrault's Puss. However, the tale ends with Cagliuso, in gratitude <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cat,</b> promising the feline a gold coffin upon his death. Three days later, the cat decides to test Gagliuso by pretending to be dead and is mortified to hear Gagliuso tell his wife to take the dead cat by its paws and throw it out the window. The cat leaps up, demanding to know whether this was his promised reward for helping the beggar boy to a better life. The cat then rushes away, leaving his master to fend for himself. In another rendition, the cat performs acts of bravery, then a fairy comes and turns him to his normal state to be with other cats.|$|E

25|$|The pig {{was moving}} its ears. Since the cat saw it, it {{thought it was}} a mouse and in a rush jumped there. The pig was very frightened and, {{emitting}} loud shouts, ran away to the forest. The wolf, the hare and the fox thought that a great animal or something was coming and, one running faster than the other, they ran away. All the ram's meat was left <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cat.</b> For seven days the cat ate, ate until it was full the spoils of the wolf and the fox.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a legend}} {{that takes place}} in the time of Nabeshima Mitsushige, the second daimyo of the Saga Domain, Hizen Province, {{concerning}} the bakeneko. Mitsushige's retainer Ryūzōji Matashichirō served as the daimyos opponent in the game of go. Ryūzōji displeased Mitsushige and was put to the sword.

25|$|In the Hellsing manga {{series by}} Kouta Hirano, {{one of the}} {{depicted}} Nazis is an artificial catboy named Schrödinger. He claims that he is everywhere and nowhere at the same time, which is similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> being alive and dead at the same time.

In the second anime adaption, he eventually allows himself to be absorbed by the vampire Alucard, which causes his awareness to be clouded. This then spreads to Alucard, who vanishes for thirty years. Alucard returns after destroying the millions of souls within himself, giving him access to all of Schrödinger's abilities.|$|E
25|$|On 16 October 1945, during Sainfoins voyage {{back to the}} United Kingdom, Sainfoin {{received}} a distress call from the hospital ship , which was carrying 820 repatriated prisoners of war from Hong Kong to Madras, India. It took Sainfoin four hours to reach Takliwa, which had run aground at Indira Point, Great Nicobar, and caught fire. Using her LCAs, Sainfoin rescued all 1,083 people on board Takliwa, {{as well as the}} ship's cat. During the rescue, three of Sainfoins LCAs were lost. Sainfoins mascot, a baboon named Mortimer, took a liking <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cat.</b> On arrival at Bombay, the cat promptly went ashore. Mortimer's intended fate was to be given to a zoo in the United Kingdom, but he grew too big and dangerous so he was euthanased before Sainfoin reached the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Leaving ECW {{shortly after}} this incident, Slivenski began {{competing}} in the Mid-Eastern Wrestling Federation (MEWF). A month before his run-in with New Jack, he had wrestled Steve Corino in Baltimore. His injuries caused him to miss a year of ringtime before eventually returning to the ring in early 1997. In {{one of his first}} matches back, he was scheduled to headline a National Wrestling League show in Boonsboro, Maryland with Devon Storm on April 22, 1997, but the match was cancelled when Storm was unable to appear.

25|$|The cat's paw {{title was}} to be used once again in a cartoon {{relating}} to the political maneuvering that preceded {{the passing of the}} English Reform Act in 1832. In this King William IV is the cat, being coaxed by the bewigged Lord Chancellor Henry Brougham, depicted as a monkey seated at his side, to pull the hot iron of reform from a blazing fire. In this case the reference is to La Fontaine's version of the story. Another contemporary source to draw a parallel between the passing of the bill and the fable was the satirical paper Figaro in London. There the claim is made that the Irish members of Parliament halted agitations for wider representation while the Reform Bill was being passed and were now cheated of a similar reward. The political leader Daniel O'Connell is likened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> in the fable and the report is followed by the poem, “The grey monkey and the Irish cat”, concluding with the lines “And thus 'twill always be, whoever lingers/ About the grate is sure to burn his fingers”. The idiom of getting one's fingers burned alludes, according to Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, “to taking chestnuts from the fire”.|$|E
500|$|Cats have {{relatively}} few taste buds compared to humans (470 or so versus more than 9,000 {{on the human}} tongue). Domestic and wild cats share a gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness. Their taste buds instead respond to amino acids, bitter tastes, and acids. [...] Cats and many other animals have a Jacobson's organ located in their mouths {{that allows them to}} taste-smell certain aromas in a way of which humans have no experience. Cats also have a distinct temperature preference for their food, preferring food with a temperature around [...] which {{is similar to that of}} a fresh kill and routinely rejecting food presented cold or refrigerated (which would signal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> that the [...] "prey" [...] item is long dead and therefore possibly toxic or decomposing).|$|E

500|$|The CFA {{investigated}} the incident {{at the request}} of a Singapura breed club. In the investigation, Hal Meadow told the investigation board that the three cats were grandchildren of four local cats he sent back to the US during a previous sensitive business trip to Singapore in 1971, contradicting the Meadows' earlier claim of the foundation cats' origin. Apparently Tommy Meadow lied about it to conceal the secret trip. The CFA found no wrongdoing and kept the Singapura's status as a natural breed. CFA's Joan Miller said that [...] "Whether they mated on the streets of Singapore or whether they mated in Michigan, it doesn't really matter." [...] Referring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> picked up from the SPCA in 1981, she said that [...] "In addition, {{there is at least one}} documented cat that is behind many Singapura pedigrees and it was picked up at the pound.

500|$|Servals locate prey {{by their}} {{strong sense of}} hearing. To kill small prey, the serval will slowly stalk it, then pounce on it with the forefeet {{directed}} toward the chest, and finally land on it with its forelegs outstretched. The prey, receiving a blow from {{one or both of}} the serval's forepaws, is incapacitated, and the serval gives it a bite on the head or the neck and immediately swallows it. Snakes are dealt more blows and even bites, and may be consumed even as they are moving. Larger prey, such as larger birds, are killed by a sprint followed by a leap to catch them as they are trying to flee, and are eaten slowly. Servals have been observed caching large kills to be consumed later by concealing them in dead leaves and grasses. Servals typically get rid of the internal organs of rodents while eating, and pluck feathers from birds before consuming them. During a leap, a serval can reach more than [...] above the ground and cover a horizontal distance of up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> can even change direction mid-air. Servals appear to be efficient hunters; a study in Ngorongoro showed that servals were successful in half of their hunting attempts, regardless of the time of hunting, and a mother serval was found to have a success rate of 62%. The number of kills in a 24-hour period averaged 15 to 16. Scavenging has been observed, but very rarely.|$|E
