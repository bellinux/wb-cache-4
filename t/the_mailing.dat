Players enjoyed the bimonthly newsletter's crossword puzzles and jokes, but game secrets were most valued. The Fun Club drew kids in by offering tips for the more complicated games, especially Zelda, with its hidden rooms, secret keys and passageways. <b>The</b> <b>mailing</b> list grew. By early 1988, there were over 1 million Fun Club members, which led then-Nintendo of America president Minoru Arakawa to start the Nintendo Power magazine.|$|E

5|$|Two {{important}} legal {{decisions in}} the 1930s helped increase the accessibility of contraceptives. In 1930, two condom manufacturers sued {{each other in the}} Youngs Rubber case, and the judge ruled that contraceptive manufacturing was a legitimate business enterprise. He went further, and declared that the federal law prohibiting <b>the</b> <b>mailing</b> of condoms was not legally sound. Sanger precipitated a second legal breakthrough when she ordered a diaphragm from Japan in 1932, hoping to provoke a decisive battle in the courts. The diaphragm was confiscated by the U.S. government, and Sanger's subsequent legal challenge led to the 1936 One Package legal ruling by Judge Augustus Hand. His decision overturned an important provision of the anti-contraception laws that prohibited physicians from obtaining contraceptives.Rose, Melody, Abortion: A Documentary and Reference Guide, ABC-CLIO, 2008, p. 29.Tone, p. 178: Tone calls the ruling a coup d'etat for Sanger. This court victory motivated the American Medical Association in 1937 to finally adopt contraception as a normal medical service and a core component of medical school curricula.. Retrieved 15 October 2011. However, the medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources until the 1960s.|$|E

50|$|Email {{messages}} are composed, delivered, {{and stored in}} a multiple step process, which starts with the message's composition. When the user finishes composing the message and sends it, the message {{is transformed into a}} standard format: an RFC 2822 formatted message. Afterwards, the message can be transmitted. Using a network connection, <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> client, referred to as a mail user agent (MUA), connects to a mail transfer agent (MTA) operating on <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> server. <b>The</b> <b>mail</b> client then provides the sender’s identity to the server. Next, using <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> server commands, <b>the</b> client sends the recipient list to <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> server. <b>The</b> client then supplies the message. Once <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> server receives and processes the message, several events occur: recipient server identification, connection establishment, and message transmission. Using Domain Name System (DNS) services, <b>the</b> sender’s <b>mail</b> server determines <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> server(s) for <b>the</b> recipient(s). Then, the server opens up a connection(s) to <b>the</b> recipient <b>mail</b> server(s) and sends the message employing a process similar to that used by the originating client, delivering the message to the recipient(s).|$|R

The list's founder acknowledged suggesting that journalists write an open letter of support to Quinn {{in response to the}} harassment she was facing, but said other members of the list had rejected his suggestion and helped him understand why his idea was inappropriate. Commentators did not consider the list to represent collusion, observing that it is a standard practice across professions to adopt informal venues for discussing matters of professional interest.
