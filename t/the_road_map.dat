25|$|Following the {{appointment}} of Abbas, the U.S. administration promoted <b>the</b> <b>Road</b> <b>map</b> for peace—the Quartet's plan to end the Israeli–Palestinian conflict by disbanding militant organizations, halting settlement activity and establishing a democratic and peaceful Palestinian state.

On 8 February 2005, at the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit of 2005, Sharon and Abbas declared a mutual truce between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority. They shook hands at a four-way summit that also included Jordan and Egypt at Sharm al-Sheikh. However, Hamas and Islamic Jihad said the truce is not binding for their members.

25|$|Another {{approach}} {{was taken by}} a team of negotiators led by former Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, and former Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo following {{two and a half years}} of secret negotiations. On 1 December 2003, the two parties signed an unofficial suggested plan for peace in Geneva (dubbed the Geneva Accord). In sharp contrast to <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>map,</b> it is not a plan for a temporary ceasefire but a comprehensive and detailed solution aiming at all the issues at stake, in particular, Jerusalem, the settlements and the refugee problem. It was met with bitter denunciation by the Israeli government and many Palestinians, with the Palestinian Authority staying non-committal, but it was warmly welcomed by many European governments and some significant elements of the Bush Administration, including Secretary of State Colin Powell.|$|E
25|$|The {{first country}} to propose 100% {{renewable}} energy was Iceland, in 1998. Proposals {{have been made}} for Japan in 2003, and for Australia in 2011. Albania, Iceland, and Paraguay obtain essentially all of their electricity from renewable sources (Albania and Paraguay 100% from hydroelectricity, Iceland 72% hydro and 28% geothermal). Norway obtains nearly all of its electricity from renewable sources (97 percent from hydropower). Iceland proposed using hydrogen for transportation and its fishing fleet. Australia proposed biofuel for those elements of transportation not easily converted to electricity. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>map</b> for the United States, commitment by Denmark, and Vision 2050 for Europe set a 2050 timeline for converting to 100% renewable energy, later reduced to 2040 in 2011. Zero Carbon Britain 2030 proposes eliminating carbon emissions in Britain by 2030 by transitioning to renewable energy. In 2015, Hawaii enacted a law that the Renewable Portfolio Standard shall be 100 percent by 2045. This is often confused with renewable energy. If electricity produced on the grid is 65 GWh from fossil fuel and 35 GWh from renewable energy and rooftop off grid solar produces 80 GWh of renewable energy then the total renewable energy is 115 GWh and the total electricity on the grid is 100 GWh. Then the RPS is 115 percent.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>mapping</b> methodology we {{developed in the}} context of the CyberROAD EU FP 7 project, whose aim is to develop a research roadmap for cybercrime and cyber terrorism. To this aim we built on state-of-the-art methodologies and available guidelines, including related projects, and adapted them to the peculiarities of our <b>road</b> <b>mapping</b> subject. In particular, its distinctive feature is that cybercrime and cyber terrorism co-evolve with their contextual environment (i. e., Technology, society, politics and economy), which poses specific challenges to a <b>road</b> <b>mapping</b> effort. Our approach can become a best practice in the field of cyber security, and can be also generalised to phenomena that exhibit a similar, strong co-evolution with their contextual environment.
