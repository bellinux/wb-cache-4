40|$|ObjectiveCryopreserved <b>allograft</b> <b>tissue</b> {{used in the}} Norwood {{procedure}} for infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome causes a marked immunologic sensitization that may complicate future heart transplantation. Treatment of the <b>allograft</b> <b>tissue</b> before implantation may prevent this sensitization. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the anti-human leukocyte antigen antibody response to glutaraldehyde-treated <b>allograft</b> <b>tissue</b> used in the repair of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. MethodsSince June 2005, the University of Alberta has subjected <b>allograft</b> vascular <b>tissue</b> used in the Norwood procedure to glutaraldehyde treatment. An observational study was designed to assess whether glutaraldehyde treatment of the <b>allograft</b> <b>tissue</b> affected subsequent panel reactive antibody after patch implantation. Panel reactive antibodies for class I (human leukocyte antigen-A, B, C) and class II (human leukocyte antigen-DR, DQ) antibodies were measured 4 months postoperatively using flow cytometry. ResultsFourteen patients underwent a Norwood procedure using glutaraldehyde-treated <b>allograft</b> <b>tissue.</b> Historical controls consisted of 12 patients who underwent a Norwood procedure using untreated <b>allograft</b> <b>tissue.</b> At 4 months, infants who had received glutaraldehyde-treated <b>allograft</b> <b>tissue</b> had lower class I panel reactive antibody (7. 3 % ± 17. 4 % [median, 0 %] vs 61. 9 % [median, 73 %] ± 39. 9 %; P =. 0005) and class II panel reactive antibody (6. 1 % [median, 0 %] ± 22. 7 % vs 49. 3 % [median, 63 %] ± 41. 9 %, P =. 001) compared with the historical controls. ConclusionIntraoperative glutaraldehyde treatment of <b>allograft</b> <b>tissue</b> used in hypoplastic left heart syndrome repair prevents the profound immunologic sensitization that occurs in the majority of infants undergoing surgical palliation.

In this paper we have investigated the role of host thymus in the induction ot tolerance in rat hind-limb allograft model. Material and MethodsFive weeks old, euthymic (group A) and thymectomized (group B) Lewis recipients (LEW,RT 1 l) received vascularized hind-limb allografts from Lewis-Brown-Norway (LBNŕF 1, RT 1 l+n) donors. Group lA (n= 6) and 1 B (n= 6) and Group IIA (n= 6) and IIB (n= 6) served as the isograft and the allograft control groups, respectively. Groups IIIA (n= 5) IIIB (n= 5) and IVA (n= 5) and IVB (n= 5) received monotherapies of either ab-TCR mAb or CsA tor 7 days, respectively. In Groups VA(n= 6) and VB (n= 6) a treatment protocol of combined ab-TCR/CsA was applied for 7 days. Mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) and skin grafting were performed {{for the evaluation of}} the donor specific tolerance in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Flow cytometry analysis was applied for the determination of the efficacy ot immunosuppressive treatment and the presence of mixed donor specific, hematopoietic chimerism. ResultsCombined treatment with ab-TCR/CsA protocol resulted in indefinite survival of the euthymic rats from group VB (> 100 days) and extended the survival of the animals from group VA up to 51 days, post-transplant. MLR showed donor specific tolerance in the group VA at day 100.

A vascularized composite tissue allotransplantation has been recognized as a solid organ transplantation rather than {{a special kind of}} tissue transplantation. The recent classification of composite tissue allografts into the category of donor organs gave rise to a number of organizational, ethical, legal, technical, and economic problems. In May 2015, the first successful transplantation of a composite facial <b>tissue</b> <b>allograft</b> was performed in Russia. The article describes our experience of multiple team interactions at donor management stage when involved in the identification, conditioning, harvesting, and delivering donor organs to various hospitals. A man, aged 51 years old, diagnosed with traumatic brain injury became a donor after the diagnosis of brain death had been made, his death had been ascertained, and the requested consent for organ donation had been obtained from relatives. At donor management stage, a tracheostomy was performed and a posthumous facial mask was molded. The "face first, concurrent completion" algorithm was chosen for organ harvesting and facial VCA procurement; meanwhile, the facial allograft was procured as the "full face" category. The total surgery duration from the incision to completing the procurement (including that of solid organs) made 8 hours 20 minutes. Immediately after the procurement, the facial VCA complex was sent to the St. Petersburg clinic by medical aircraft transportation, and was there transplanted 9 hours later. Donor kidneys were transported to Moscow by civil aviation and transplanted 17 and 20 hours later. The authors believe that this clinical case report demonstrates the feasibility and safety of multiple harvesting of solid organs and a vascularized composite facial <b>tissue</b> <b>allograft.</b> However, this kind of surgery requires an essential multidisciplinary approach.
