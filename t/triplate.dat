50|$|Following the war, one {{important}} research avenue {{was trying to}} increase the design bandwidth of wide-band filters. The approach used at the time (and still in use today) was {{to start with a}} lumped element prototype filter and through various transformations arrive at the desired filter in a distributed element form. This approach appeared to be stuck at a minimum Q of five (see Band-pass filters below for an explanation of Q). In 1957, Leo Young at Stanford Research Institute published a method for designing filters which started with a distributed element prototype. This prototype was based on quarter wave impedance transformers and was able to produce designs with bandwidths up to an octave, corresponding to a Q of about 1.3. Some of Young's procedures in that paper were empirical, but later, exact solutions were published. Young's paper specifically addresses directly coupled cavity resonators, but the procedure can equally be applied to other directly coupled resonator types, such as those found in modern planar technologies and illustrated in this article. The capacitive gap filter (figure 8) and the parallel-coupled lines filter (figure 9) are examples of directly coupled resonators.The introduction of printed planar technologies greatly simplified the manufacture of many microwave components including filters, and microwave integrated circuits then became possible.

5000|$|Stripline is a flat {{conductor}} with a ground plane both {{above and below}} the conductor. The variant of stripline where the space between the two ground planes is completey filled with a dielectric material is sometimes known as <b>triplate.</b> Stripline can be manufactured by etching the transmission line pattern on to a printed circuit board. The bottom of this board is left completely covered in copper and forms the bottom ground plane. A second board is clamped on top of the first. This second board has no pattern on the bottom and plain copper on the top to form the top ground plane. A sheet of copper foil may be wrapped around the two boards to electrically bond the two ground planes firmly together. On the other hand, stripline for high power applications such as radar will more likely be made as solid metal strips with periodic dielectric supports, essentially air dielectric.|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} of planar technologies was driven at {{first by the}} needs of the US military, but today it can be found in household mass-produced items such as mobile phones and satellite TV receivers. [...] According to Thomas H. Lee, Harold A. Wheeler may have experimented with coplanar lines as early as the 1930s. However, the first documented planar transmission line was stripline, invented by Robert M. Barrett and published by Barrett and Barnes in 1951. Although publication did not occur until the 1950s, stripline had actually been used during World War II. According to Barrett, the first stripline power divider was built by V. H. and H. W. Jameison during this period. Microstrip followed soon after in 1952 due to Grieg and Englemann. However, the quality of common dielectric materials was at first not good enough for microwave circuits and consequently their use did not become widespread until the 1960s. Stripline and microstrip were commercial rivals. Stripline was the brand name of Airborne Instruments Laboratory Inc. (AIL) who made air stripline. Microstrip was made by ITT. Later, dielectric filled stripline under the brand name <b>triplate</b> was manufactured by Sanders Associates. Stripline became a generic term for dielectric filled stripline and air stripline or suspended stripline is now used to distinguish the original format.|$|E

INTRODUCTION <b>Triplate</b> line fed arrays have been researched extensively over the last 10 years for DBS television subscriber antenna in Japan and Europe.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{reports a}} MEMS microforce sensor {{with a novel}} {{configuration}} of bulk micromachined differential <b>triplate</b> comb drives that overcomes the difficulty of electrically isolating the two stationary capacitor comb sets in bulk micromachining. A high-yield fabrication process using deep-reactive ion etching (DRIE) on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers and only three litho-graphic masks was utilized to construct the high aspect ratio de-vices. The process features dry release of both suspended struc-tures and the entire device {{in order to protect}} fragile components. The sensor has a high sensitivity (1. 35 mV N), good linearity (4 %), and a large bandwidth (7. 8 kHz), and is therefore well suited for characterizing flight behavior of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). The technique allows for the instantaneous mea-surement of flight forces, which result from a combination of aero-dynamic forces and inertial forces generated by the wings, and demonstrates a novel experimental paradigm for exploring flight biomechanics in the fruit fly. The average lift force is determined to be 9. 3 N (2. 3 N), which is in the range of typical body weights of fruit flies. The potential impact of this research extends beyond gathering flight data on Drosophila melanogaster by demonstrating how MEMS technology can be used to provide valuable tools for biomechanical investigations.

40|$|Antennas with {{intelligent}} beamforming and {{beam steering}} enhance the overall system performance of future satellite systems for navigation and communication. The generation of {{multiple independent beams}} facilitates the use of SDMA and the simultaneous tracking of different satellites to guarantee reliable communication channels free from interference for any satellite constellation and terminal position. For jammer suppression and reduction of multipath propagation effects, definite nulling and side lobe attenuation can be used.

The other one, designed for future navigation systems in C-band, has already been fabricated as a breadboard model and was successfully tested [1]. The integration of antenna elements, active RF-devices and digital signal processing requires a multilayer structure. Ground planes in the interfaces ensure proper shielding and well-defined signal propagation along microstrips or striplines.

40|$|We have {{developed}} an accelerator architecture that can {{serve as the basis}} of the design of petawatt-class z-pinch drivers. The architecture has been applied to the design of two z-pinch accelerators, each of which can be contained within a 104 -m-diameter cylindrical tank. One accelerator is driven by slow (∼ 1 [*]  μs) Marx generators, which are a mature technology but which necessitate significant pulse compression to achieve the short pulses (≪ 1 [*]  μs) required to drive z pinches. The other is powered by linear transformer drivers (LTDs), which are less mature but produce much shorter pulses than conventional Marxes. Consequently, an LTD-driven accelerator promises to be (at a given pinch current and implosion time) more efficient and reliable. The Marx-driven accelerator produces a peak electrical power of 500  TW and includes the following components: (i) 300 Marx generators that comprise a total of 1. 8 × 10 ^{ 4 } capacitors, store 98  MJ, and erect to 5  MV; (ii) 600 water-dielectric <b>triplate</b> intermediate-store transmission lines, which also serve as pulse-forming lines; (iii) 600 5 -MV laser-triggered gas switches; (iv) three monolithic radial-transmission-line impedance transformers, with <b>triplate</b> geometries and exponential impedance profiles; (v) a 6 -level 5. 5 -m-diameter 15 -MV vacuum insulator stack; (vi) six magnetically insulated vacuum transmission lines (MITLs); and (vii) a triple-post-hole vacuum convolute that adds the output currents of the six MITLs, and delivers the combined current to a z-pinch load. The accelerator delivers an effective peak current of 52  MA to a 10 -mm-length z pinch that implodes in 95  ns, and 57  MA to a pinch that implodes in 120  ns. The LTD-driven accelerator includes monolithic radial transformers and a MITL system similar to those described above, but does not include intermediate-store transmission lines, multimegavolt gas switches, or a laser trigger system.

The LTD accelerator stores 182  MJ and produces a peak electrical power of 1000  TW. The accelerator delivers an effective peak current of 68  MA to a pinch that implodes in 95  ns, and 75  MA to a pinch that implodes in 120  ns.

McDaniel et al., in Proceedings of the 5 th International Conference on Dense Z-Pinches (AIP, New York, 2002), p.   23] has been developed. This large-scale simulation model tracks the evolution of electromagnetic waves through the accelerator’s intermediate-storage capacitors, laser-triggered gas switches, pulse-forming lines, water switches, <b>triplate</b> transmission lines, and water convolute to the vacuum insulator stack. The insulator-stack electrodes are coupled to a transmission-line circuit {{model of the}} four-level magnetically insulated vacuum-transmission-line section and double-post-hole convolute.

The impedance of the joints has been measured in wide frequency range (20 Hz to 1 MHz and 300 MHz to 3 GHz). Measurements {{have been carried out}} by two methods: impedance in the range 20 Hz to 1 MHz has been measured by LCR meter HP 4284 A. A special test board for assembly of 1 jumper (of the type 1206) by electrically conductive adhesive has been fabricated for this measurement.

40|$|There are two {{distinct}} parts to this thesis; the first investigates {{the use of}} ferrite tiles {{in the construction of}} printed phase shifting transmission lines, culminating in the design of two compact electromagnetic controlled beam steered patch and slot antenna arrays. The second part investigates the use of active frequency selective surfaces (AFSS), which are later used to cover a uPVC constructed enclosure. Field intensity measurements are taken from within the enclosure to determine the dynamic screening effectiveness. Trans Tech G- 350 Ferrite is investigated to determine its application in printed microstrip and stripline phase shifting transmission lines. 50 -Ohm transmission lines are constructed using the ferrite tile and interfaced to Rogers RT Duroid 5870 substrate. Scattering parameter measurements are made under the application of variable magnetic fields to the ferrite. Later, two types of planar microwave beam steering antennas are constructed. The first uses the ferrites integrated into the Duroid as microstrip lines with 3 patch antennas as the radiating elements. The second uses stripline transmission lines, with slot antennas as the radiating sources etched into the ground plane of the <b>triplate.</b> Beam steering is achieved by the application of an external electromagnet. An AFSS is constructed by the interposition of PIN diodes into a dipole FSS array. Transmission response measurements are then made for various angles of electromagnetic wave incidence. Two states of operation exist: when a current is passed through the diodes and when the diodes are switched off. These two states form a high pass and band stop space filter respectively. An enclosure covered with the AFSS is constructed and externally illuminated in the range 2. 0 - 2. 8 GHz. A probe antenna inside the enclosure positioned at various locations through out the volume is used to establish the effective screening action of the AFSS in 3 dimensional space.

Zero-field splitting parameters, line shape, and Jahn-Teller distortion in the temperature range 3. 8 - 150 K are {{discussed in terms of}} porphyrin-protein interactions. The zero-field splitting parameters D for the free-base, Zn and Sn derivatives are 465 x 10 (- 4), 342 x 10 (- 4) and 353 x 10 (- 4) cm- 1, respectively, and are temperature invariant over the temperature ranges studied. AN E value at 4 K of 73 x 10 (- 4) cm- 1 was obtained for Zn cytochrome c, larger than any previously found for Zn porphyrins derivatives of hemeproteins, showing that the heme site of cytochrome c imposes an asymmetric field. Though the E value for Zn cytochrome c is large, the geometry of the site appears quite constrained, as indicated by a spectral line shape showing a single species. Intersystem crossing occurred predominantly to the T 2 > zero-field spin sublevel. EPR line shape changes with respect to temperature of Zn cyt c are interpreted in terms of vibronic coupling, and a maximum Jahn-Teller crystal-field splitting of approximately 180 cm- 1 is obtained. Sn cytochrome c in comparison with the Zn protein exhibits a photoactivated triplet line shape that is less well resolved in the X-Y region. The magnitude of E value is approximately 60 x 10 (- 4) cm- 1 at 4 K; its value rapidly tends toward zero with increasing temperature, from which a value for the Jahn-Teller crystal-field splitting of > or = 40 cm- 1 is estimated. In contrast to those for the metal cytochromes, the magnitude of E value for the free-base derivative was essentially zero at all temperatures studied. This finding is discussed as a consequence of an excited-state tautomerization process that occurs even at 4 K...|$|E
