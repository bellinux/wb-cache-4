2500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service (RNNAS) {{began looking for}} a {{replacement}} for its Sopwith Baby fighter aircraft, contacting 19 foreign manufacturers asking for bids for licence production of four fighter aircraft in Norway. While many offers were received, {{only a few of}} the aircraft types on offer were for purpose-designed seaplanes. As it was the clear request of the RNNAS <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tried</b> and tested seaplane fighter only the bids coming in from Fokker and Nieuport Astra satisfied the requirement. As the cost of both these offers were considered far too high, Johann E. Høver, managing director at Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk, recommended that a future fighter should be designed and constructed at his factory in Horten. Høver claimed that he could deliver four fighters with [...] Hispano-Suiza engines at the cost of 220,000 Norwegian kroner, just half of what the foreign bidders demanded. After cost estimates and calculations had been carried out, the Norwegian Ministry of Defence approved the project on 8 March 1924. The project was then submitted to the Permanent Flying Commission (...) and evaluated on 1 May 1924. Only Klingenberg, managing director [...] of the Kjeller Aircraft Factory, <b>had</b> <b>a</b> negative opinion of the design, being especially critical of the choice of a relatively weak engine. The manufacture of parts for the prototype M.F.9 began in August 1924 and the wing construction was tested at an aeronautical institute in Göttingen in the German [...] Weimar Republic, as well as being brought to breaking point in Horten. The Royal Norwegian Navy required the aircraft <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> top speed of 200km/h, reach an altitude of 3,000 metres in 12 minutes and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sturdy construction able to endure dog fighting. The aircraft also needed to be a stable platform and be easy to manoeuvre on water.|$|R

500|$|The plot for [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride" [...] {{originated}} from an idea by series co-founders Trey Parker and Matt Stone <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> boy <b>try</b> <b>to</b> convince his gay dog {{not to be}} homosexual. Michael Smith, a childhood friend of Parker and {{a basis for the}} Ned Gerblansky character, claimed that Big Gay Al was based in part on a real-life resident of Fairplay, Colorado.

He lives out of town, which is why Big Gay Al's cartoon pet sanctuary is set out in the hills".

Perhaps that was because Reddy is very selfish himself. So the next time Granny plunged into the snow and missed Danny Meadow Mouse just as before, Reddy rushed in ahead of her, and the minute he heard Danny running down below, he plunged in just as he had seen Granny do. But he didn't take the pains to make sure of just where Danny was, and so of course he didn't come anywhere near him. But he frightened Danny still more and made old Granny Fox lose her temper.|$|E
