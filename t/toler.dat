5|$|Chan first {{appeared}} in Biggers' novels, then was featured {{in a number of}} media. Over four dozen films featuring Charlie Chan were made, beginning in 1926. The character was first portrayed by East Asian actors, and the films met with little success. In 1931, the Fox Film Corporation cast Swedish actor Warner Oland as Chan in Charlie Chan Carries On; the film became popular, and Fox went on to produce fifteen more Chan films with Oland in the title role. After Oland's death, American actor Sidney <b>Toler</b> was cast as Chan; <b>Toler</b> made twenty-two Chan films, first for Fox and then for Monogram Studios. After Toler's death, six films were made, starring Roland Winters.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{receiver}} Ernest Wilford caught 8passes for 110yards, setting {{school records}} for career pass receptions with 126, most receptions {{in a bowl}} game, and most receptions in a season (56). Tech's Marcus Vick, normally a quarterback, was put into the game several times as a wide receiver. He caught four passes for 82yards and a touchdown. California wide receiver Chase Lyman led all receivers statistically, finishing with five receptions for 149yards and a touchdown. Burl <b>Toler</b> had the most California receptions, catching sixpasses for 84yards. Lyman's total was a career-high for him and a California bowl game record.|$|E
5|$|After the {{ceremonial}} pre-game coin toss, California chose {{to receive the}} ball to begin the game. James Bethea returned the opening kickoff to the California 21-yard line. On the game's first play from scrimmage, California quarterback Aaron Rodgers completed a 19-yard pass to wide receiver Burl <b>Toler,</b> presaging the game's offensive nature. Rodgers completed another pass, and the Bears were aided by a penalty against Virginia Tech. Running back Adimchinobe Echemandu ran the ball twice for short gains each time, and Rodgers continued to make long passes for first downs to keep the Golden Bears' offensive drive going. Deep inside Virginia Tech territory, Rodgers ran the ball twice, picking up short gains and the game's first touchdown. The extra point kick by kicker Tyler Fredrickson was good, and with 9:43 remaining in the quarter, California took a 7–0 lead.|$|E

50|$|The {{show was}} {{cancelled}} mid-way {{through the second}} season due to low ratings, the effects of preemptions {{at the start of}} the second season due to the September 11 attacks breaking the momentum of <b>Toler's</b> debut, and high cost of the 10 or so rotating high-profile attorneys.|$|R
5|$|This {{turned out}} to be unnecessary, however, as Tyler Fredrickson's punt was {{returned}} 52yards by Virginia Tech's DeAngelo Hall for a touchdown. Hall's return tied the game at 49–49, and with 3:11 remaining in the game, California took over on offense. On his first play after receiving Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff, Aaron Rodgers was sacked by the Virginia Tech defense and fumbled the ball. The Bears' Chris Murphy jumped on the ball, preventing what otherwise might have been a game-losing turnover. Rodgers recovered from the fumble by completing three straight passes: first to J. J. Arrington for 11yards, then to Brandon Hall for 18yards and a first down, then to Burl <b>Toler</b> for 22yards and another first down. The last play took California deep into Virginia Tech territory. At the Tech 20-yard line, Rodgers rushed for a five-yard gain, then prepared the offense for a potential game-winning field goal kick. With twoseconds remaining on the clock, California called timeout and sent in kicker Tyler Fredrickson. Despite an attempt by Virginia Tech to ice the kicker by calling its final timeout, Fredrickson was undeterred by the pressure and his 35-yard field goal sailed through the goalposts as time expired. The kick gave California three points and the 52–49 victory.|$|E

40|$|This work {{aimed at}} {{estimating}} clones x environments effects, their implications on selection and verifying the efficience of <b>Toler’s</b> (1990) metodologie. The mean annual yield increase(m 3 /ha. year) of {{two groups of}} clone experiments {{were used in the}} study. The GXA interaction was significant in both experiments, but it was more pronounced in the experiment with greater number ofclones. The clones x environment interaction affected in the selection, because the correlated responseto selection in one environment observed in another was always lower than the gain of direct selection. However, even in the correlated response cases, the expected percentage gain wasexpressive, indicating {{that it is possible to}} identify clones with wide adaptation. The <b>Toler’s</b> (1990) metodologie was efficient in identifying clones with greater stability. The clones were classified in five groups, according to the estimates of the stability parameters.

500|$|On radio, Charlie Chan {{was heard}} in several {{different}} series on three networks (the NBC Blue Network, Mutual, and ABC) between 1932 and 1948.

5000|$|The Allman Brothers Band reunited in 1978. Allman {{remembered that}} each member {{had their own}} reasons for rejoining, though he surmised it was a {{combination}} of displeasure with how things ended, missing each other, and a need for money. The band's reunion album, Enlightened Rogues, was released in February 1979 and was a mild commercial success. Betts's lawyer, Steve Massarsky, began managing the group, and led the band to sign with Arista, who pushed the band to [...] "modernize" [...] their sound. Drugs remained a problem with the band, particularly among Betts and Allman. The band again grew apart, replacing Jaimoe with <b>Toler's</b> brother Frankie. The band considered their post-reunion albums—Reach for the Sky (1980) and Brothers of the Road (1981)—"embarrassing", and subsequently broke up in 1982. [...] "It was like a whole different band made those records ... In truth, though, I was just too drunk most of the time to care one way or the other", Allman would recall.|$|R

25|$|Bromberg {{made his}} screen debut in 1936 under {{contract}} to Twentieth Century-Fox. The versatile actor played {{a wide variety of}} roles ranging from a ruthless New York newspaper editor (in Charlie Chan on Broadway) to a despotic Arabian sheik (in Mr. Moto Takes a Chance). Although he spoke with no trace of an accent, he was often called upon to play humble immigrants of various nationalities. When Warner Oland, the actor who played Charlie Chan, died in 1938, Fox considered J. Edward Bromberg as a suitable replacement, but the role ultimately went to Sidney <b>Toler.</b> Fox began loaning Bromberg to other studios in 1939 and finally dropped him from the roster in 1941. He kept working for various producers, including a stint at Universal Pictures in the mid-1940s.|$|E

500|$|Their first Arista effort, Reach for the Sky (1980), was {{produced}} by Nashville songwriters Mike Lawler and Johnny Cobb. Bonnie Bramlett, who toured with the band {{near the end of}} the decade, sang lead on one song. Lawler soon became a part of the band's touring ensemble, incorporating center-stage keytar solos [...] "that most fans consider the band's nadir." [...] Drugs remained a problem with the band, particularly among Betts and Allman. Although the album was made with the intention of creating a hit single, the genre of Southern rock was waning considerably in the mainstream. The band again grew apart, firing longtime roadie [...] "Red Dog" [...] and replacing Jaimoe with <b>Toler's</b> brother Frankie, who had been a member of Great Southern. The main point of contention was Jaimoe's insistence that his wife and manager, Candace Oakley (Berry's sister), handle his business affairs. [...] "One of the real blights on the history of the Allman Brothers Band was that Jaimoe, this gentle man, was fired from this organization," [...] said Allman later.

500|$|When Fox {{decided to}} produce no further Chan films, Sidney <b>Toler</b> {{purchased}} the film rights. Producers Philip N. Krasne and James S. Burkett of Monogram Pictures produced and released further Chan films, starring <b>Toler.</b> The budget for these films was reduced from Fox's average of $200,000 to $75,000. For the first time, Chan was portrayed on occasion as [...] "openly contemptuous of suspects and superiors." [...] African-American comedic actor Mantan Moreland played chauffeur Birmingham Brown in 13 films (1944–1949) {{which led to}} criticism of the Monogram films in the forties and since; some call his performances [...] "brilliant comic turns", while others describe Moreland's roles as an offensive and embarrassing stereotype. <b>Toler</b> died in 1947 and was succeeded by Roland Winters for six films.

Williams and Leavell declined to leave Sea Level, so the Allman Brothers Band hired two new members: guitarist Dan <b>Toler</b> and bassist David Goldflies. The band reunited with Tom Dowd at Criteria Studios in Miami to cut their reunion album, which was released in February 1979 as Enlightened Rogues, a term Duane had used to describe the band. While the band [...] "tried to make it happen," [...] they later concluded that the chemistry was not there; the album was a minor commercial success, which was credited to the production work from Dowd. Betts filed a lawsuit against Walden for nonpayment of record and publishing royalties, and Betts's lawyer, Steve Massarsky, began managing the group. Betts won the lawsuit, and the rest of the band filed suit while Capricorn declared bankruptcy that October. Massarsky led the successful effort to sign the band with Arista, which pushed the band to [...] "modernize" [...] their sound.
