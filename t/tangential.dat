5|$|Classic {{learning}} {{theories and}} the modern dual-coding theory support the introduction of interesting, <b>tangential</b> details to learning content. There is evidence that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and is better remembered because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. This suggests that interesting material, even if <b>tangential</b> to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting material.|$|E
5|$|First contact—when the Moon's limb (edge) {{is exactly}} <b>tangential</b> to the Sun's limb.|$|E
5|$|That transit is so <b>tangential,</b> that {{properties}} {{such as its}} radius, density, {{and temperature}} are unknown. Assuming a composition {{similar to that of}} Jupiter and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium, 55 Cancri b's upper atmosphere is predicted to be cloudless with a spectrum dominated by alkali metal absorption.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} {{of the book is}} divided into four short stories by different writers and artists from the computer game and comic industries. Each story focuses on different aspects of the Halo universe, revealing stories that are <b>tangential</b> to the main plot of the game. Apart from the stories, the book also contains an extensive art gallery compiled of contributions from Bungie, Marvel and independent sources.|$|E
5|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} be {{extended}} to construct all the circles that intersect three given circles at a precise angle θ, or at three specified crossing angles θ1, θ2 and θ3; the ordinary Apollonius' problem corresponds to a special {{case in which the}} crossing angle is zero for all three given circles. Another generalization is the dual of the first extension, namely, to construct circles with three specified <b>tangential</b> distances from the three given circles.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies {{arise from}} the tips or the lateral {{branches}} or rhizomorphs. New fruit bodies are made of an exterior of thick hyphae {{similar to those found}} in the rhizomorph core; in contrast, the hyphae of the interior originate from the puffball's core. Unlike some other puffball species, the peridium does not differentiate into a distinct exoperidium and endoperidium; rather, the outer layer develops the features of a pseudoparenchyma (a tightly organised tissue where the tightly packed cells resemble plant parenchyma) as the radial and <b>tangential</b> hyphae become interweaved. In time, the peridium dries and falls off in flakes to expose the underlying gleba.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{the country}} music charts were {{dominated}} by pop singers with only <b>tangential</b> influences from country music, a trend that has continued since. The 1980s saw a revival of honky-tonk-style country {{with the rise of}} people like Dwight Yoakam and the new traditionalists Emmylou Harris and Ricky Skaggs, as well as the development of alternative country performers like Uncle Tupelo. Later alternative country performers, like Whiskeytown's Ryan Adams and Wilco, found some mainstream success.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{hoped to}} produce a {{balanced}} depiction of religion, and he, Falchuk and series co-creator Ian Brennan worked {{to ensure that there}} was an equality between pro and anti-religious sentiments expressed. The episode features seven cover versions of songs, each of which charted on the Billboard Hot 100, marking the series' one-week debut high in the US. Critics disagreed over the appropriateness of the musical performances, with some complaining of the <b>tangential</b> relationship between the numbers and religion, and others appreciating that the Glee versions brought new meaning to the songs.|$|E
5|$|This {{relationship}} between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for {{it led to}} Michael Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821. Faraday's homopolar motor consisted of a permanent magnet sitting {{in a pool of}} mercury. A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury. The magnet exerted a <b>tangential</b> force on the wire, making it circle around the magnet {{for as long as the}} current was maintained.|$|E
5|$|Another element {{widely used}} by Gaudí was the {{catenary}} arch. He had studied geometry thoroughly {{when he was}} young, studying numerous articles about engineering, a field that praised {{the virtues of the}} catenary curve as a mechanical element, one which at that time, however, was used only in the construction of suspension bridges. Gaudí was the first to use this element in common architecture. Catenary arches in works like the Casa Milà, the Teresian College, the crypt of the Colònia Güell and the Sagrada Família allowed Gaudí to add an element of great strength to his structures, given that the catenary distributes the weight it regularly carries evenly, being affected only by self-canceling <b>tangential</b> forces.|$|E
5|$|By solving Apollonius' problem {{repeatedly}} {{to find the}} inscribed circle, the interstices between mutually <b>tangential</b> circles can be filled arbitrarily finely, forming an Apollonian gasket, {{also known as a}} Leibniz packing or an Apollonian packing. This gasket is a fractal, being self-similar and having a dimension d that is not known exactly but is roughly 1.3, which is higher than that of a regular (or rectifiable) curve (d = 1) but less than that of a plane (d = 2). The Apollonian gasket was first described by Gottfried Leibniz in the 17th century, and is a curved precursor of the 20th-century Sierpiński triangle. The Apollonian gasket also has deep connections to other fields of mathematics; for example, it is the limit set of Kleinian groups.|$|E
5|$|Ceramics lend {{themselves}} to circular motifs, whether radial or <b>tangential.</b> Bowls or plates can be decorated inside or out with radial stripes; these may be partly figurative, representing stylised leaves or flower petals, while circular bands can run around a bowl or jug. Patterns of these types were employed on Islamic ceramics from the Ayyubid period, 13thcentury. Radially symmetric flowers with, say, 6 petals {{lend themselves}} to increasingly stylised geometric designs which can combine geometric simplicity with recognisably naturalistic motifs, brightly coloured glazes, and a radial composition that ideally suits circular crockery. Potters often chose patterns suited {{to the shape of}} the vessel they were making. Thus an unglazed earthenware water flask from Aleppo {{in the shape of a}} vertical circle (with handles and neck above) is decorated with a ring of moulded braiding around an Arabic inscription with a small 8-petalled flower at the centre.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} approach, the radii of the given circles are {{modified}} appropriately by an amount Δr so {{that two of}} them are <b>tangential</b> (touching). Their point of tangency is chosen as the center of inversion in a circle that intersects each of the two touching circles in two places. Upon inversion, the touching circles become two parallel lines: Their only point of intersection is sent to infinity under inversion, so they cannot meet. The same inversion transforms the third circle into another circle. The solution of the inverted problem must either be (1) a straight line parallel to the two given parallel lines and tangent to the transformed third given circle; or (2) a circle of constant radius that is tangent to the two given parallel lines and the transformed given circle. Re-inversion and adjusting the radii of all circles by Δr produces a solution circle tangent to the original three circles.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} {{if there was}} a {{formally}} established constitution dictating the laws, organization, and divisions of power in ancient Macedonia's government, although some <b>tangential</b> evidence suggests this. The king (basileus) served as the head of state and was assisted by his noble companions (hetairoi) and royal pages. The Macedonian kings had command over certain natural resources such as gold from mining and timber from logging. They were also expected to serve as high priests of the nation, using their wealth to sponsor various religious cults. The ancient Macedonian army arguably exercised its authority in matters such as the royal succession when there was no clear heir apparent. The army upheld some of the functions of a popular assembly, a democratic institution which otherwise existed in only a handful of municipal governments within the Macedonian commonwealth, the Koinon of Macedonians. The Macedonian kings served as the commanders-in-chief of Macedonia's armed forces, while it was common for them to personally lead troops into battle.|$|E
5|$|Three {{aspects of}} {{communication}} patterns are of clinical interest: poor prosody, <b>tangential</b> and circumstantial speech, and marked verbosity. Although inflection and intonation {{may be less}} rigid or monotonic than in classic autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky or loud. Speech may {{convey a sense of}} incoherence; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide context for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to detect whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener to elaborate on the speech's content or logic, or to shift to related topics, are often unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Thought {{process in}} the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical coherence) of thought. Thought process cannot be {{directly}} observed but {{can only be described}} by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo of thought, some people may experience flight of ideas, when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity of thought and thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas. A pattern of interruption or disorganization of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder, and might be described more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, <b>tangential</b> thinking, derailment of thought, or knight's move thinking. Thought may be described as circumstantial when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E
25|$|Examples of <b>tangential</b> {{quadrilateral}}s are the kites, {{which include}} the rhombi, which in turn include the squares. The kites are exactly the <b>tangential</b> quadrilaterals that are also orthodiagonal. A right kite is a kite with a circumcircle. If a quadrilateral is both <b>tangential</b> and cyclic, it is called a bicentric quadrilateral, {{and if it is}} both <b>tangential</b> and a trapezoid, it is called a <b>tangential</b> trapezoid.|$|E
25|$|A <b>tangential</b> polygon, {{such as a}} <b>tangential</b> quadrilateral, is any convex polygon {{within which}} a circle can be inscribed that is tangent to {{each side of the}} polygon. Every regular polygon and every {{triangle}} is a <b>tangential</b> polygon.|$|E
25|$|A <b>tangential</b> {{quadrilateral}} is bicentric if {{and only}} if its inradius is greater than that of any other <b>tangential</b> quadrilateral having the same sequence of side lengths.|$|E
25|$|In a <b>tangential</b> {{quadrilateral}}, {{the four}} angle bisectors {{meet at the}} center of the incircle. Conversely, a convex quadrilateral in which the four angle bisectors meet at a point must be <b>tangential</b> and the common point is the incenter.|$|E
25|$|The forcing is only {{horizontal}} (<b>tangential).</b>|$|E
25|$|In Euclidean geometry, a <b>tangential</b> {{quadrilateral}} (sometimes just tangent quadrilateral) or circumscribed quadrilateral is a convex quadrilateral whose {{sides are}} all tangent {{to a single}} circle within the quadrilateral. This circle is called the incircle of the quadrilateral or its inscribed circle, its center is the incenter and its radius is called the inradius. Since these quadrilaterals can be drawn surrounding or circumscribing their incircles, they have also been called circumscribable quadrilaterals, circumscribing quadrilaterals, and circumscriptible quadrilaterals. <b>Tangential</b> quadrilaterals are a special case of <b>tangential</b> polygons.|$|E
25|$|The Whewell {{equation}} relates {{arc length}} and the <b>tangential</b> angle.|$|E
25|$|Shrinkage and {{swelling}} may occur in wood when the moisture content is changed (Stamm, 1964). Shrinkage occurs as moisture content decreases, while swelling takes place when it increases. Volume {{change is not}} equal in all directions. The greatest dimensional change occurs in a direction <b>tangential</b> to the growth rings. Shrinkage from the pith outwards, or radially, is usually considerably less than <b>tangential</b> shrinkage, while longitudinal (along the grain) shrinkage is so slight as to be usually neglected. The longitudinal shrinkage is 0.1% to 0.3%, in contrast to transverse shrinkages, which is 2% to 10%. <b>Tangential</b> shrinkage is often about twice as great as in the radial direction, although in some species it is as much as five times as great. The shrinkage is about 5% to 10% in the <b>tangential</b> direction and about 2% to 6% in the radial direction (Walker et al., 1993).|$|E
25|$|In {{non-uniform}} {{circular motion}} the net acceleration (a) is along direction of Δv which is directed inside circle {{but does not}} pass through its center (see figure). The net acceleration may be resolved into two components: <b>tangential</b> acceleration and normal acceleration {{also known as the}} centripetal or radial acceleration. Unlike <b>tangential</b> acceleration, centripetal acceleration is present in both uniform and non-uniform circular motion.|$|E
25|$|Conversely a convex {{quadrilateral}} {{in which}} a + c = b + d must be <b>tangential.</b>|$|E
25|$|In recent years, more <b>tangential</b> DevOps {{initiatives}} have also evolved, such as OpsDev, WinOps, and BizDevOps.|$|E
25|$|A <b>tangential</b> {{quadrilateral}} is a rhombus if {{and only}} if its opposite angles are equal.|$|E
25|$|The {{acceleration}} vector of the parcel is decomposed in the <b>tangential</b> acceleration {{parallel to}} s {{and in the}} centripetal acceleration along positive n. The <b>tangential</b> acceleration only changes the speed V and is equal to DV/Dt, where big d's denote the material derivative. The centripetal acceleration always points towards the centre of curvature O and only changes the direction s of the forward displacement while the parcel moves on.|$|E
25|$|The {{incenter}} of a <b>tangential</b> quadrilateral lies on its Newton line (which {{connects the}} midpoints of the diagonals).|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Vaynshtejn was {{probably}} the first to prove another beautiful characterization of <b>tangential</b> quadrilaterals, that has later appeared in several magazines and websites. It states that when a convex quadrilateral is divided into four nonoverlapping triangles by its two diagonals, then the incenters of the four triangles are concyclic {{if and only if}} the quadrilateral is <b>tangential.</b> In fact, the incenters form an orthodiagonal cyclic quadrilateral. A related result is that the incircles can be exchanged for the excircles to the same triangles (tangent to the sides of the quadrilateral and the extensions of its diagonals). Thus a convex quadrilateral is <b>tangential</b> if and only if the excenters in these four excircles are the vertices of a cyclic quadrilateral.|$|E
25|$|Isotoxal or edge-transitive: {{all sides}} lie {{within the same}} {{symmetry}} orbit. The polygon is also equilateral and <b>tangential.</b>|$|E
25|$|Work of a {{force is}} the line {{integral}} of its scalar <b>tangential</b> component along the path of its application point.|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} in {{velocity of the}} fluid is primarily in the <b>tangential</b> direction (swirl) and the stator removes this angular momentum.|$|E
25|$|The speed cannot thus {{change with}} time, and the {{component}} forces producing <b>tangential</b> acceleration need {{to sum up}} to zero.|$|E
25|$|If a line cuts a <b>tangential</b> {{quadrilateral}} {{into two}} polygons with equal areas and equal perimeters, then that line {{passes through the}} incenter.|$|E
