25|$|Economic {{success was}} short-lived. Following a lumbering {{recovery}} during 1933 to 1945, from 1946 to 1953 Argentina gained benefits from Perón's five-year plan. The GDP expanded by over a fourth during <b>that</b> <b>brief</b> boom, {{about as much}} as it had during the previous decade. Using roughly half the US$1.7billion in reserves inherited from wartime surpluses for nationalizations, economic development agencies devoted most of the other half to finance both public and private investments; the roughly 70% jump in domestic fixed investment was accounted for mostly by industrial growth in the private sector. All this much-needed activity exposed an intrinsic weakness in the plan: it subsidized growth which, in the short term, led to a wave of imports of the capital goods that local industry could not supply. Whereas the end of World War II had allowed Argentine exports to rise from US$700million to US$1.6billion, Perón's changes led to skyrocketing imports (from US$300million to US$1.6billion), and erased the surplus by 1948.|$|E

25|$|The {{place where}} {{emergency}} psychiatric services are delivered are most {{commonly referred to}} as Psychiatric Emergency Services, Psychiatric Emergency Care Centers, or Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Programs. Mental health professionals from a wide area of disciplines, including medicine, nursing, psychology, and social work in these settings alongside psychiatrists and emergency physicians. The facilities, sometimes housed in a psychiatric hospital, psychiatric ward, or emergency room, provide immediate treatment to both voluntary and involuntary patients 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Within a protected environment, psychiatric emergency services exist to provide brief stay of two or three days to gain a diagnostic clarity, find appropriate alternatives to psychiatric hospitalization for the patient, and to treat those patients whose symptoms can be improved within <b>that</b> <b>brief</b> period of time. Even precise psychiatric diagnoses are a secondary priority compared with interventions in a crisis setting. The functions of psychiatric emergency services are to assess patients' problems, implement a short-term treatment consisting of no more than ten meetings with the patient, procure a 24-hour holding area, mobilize teams to carry out interventions at patients' residences, utilize emergency management services to prevent further crises, be aware of inpatient and outpatient psychiatric resources, and provide 24/7 telephone counseling.|$|E
25|$|Novak’s wife, Geraldine, began regular churchgoing in {{the early}} 1990s and {{eventually}} settled on St Patrick’s Catholic Church, Washington, D.C. One day she persuaded Novak, who had not attended religious services for nearly 30 years, to join her at Mass. The celebrant was Fr. Peter Vaghi, whom he had known before Vaghi switched from politics to the priesthood. Novak then started to go to Mass regularly and decided to convert a few years later. According to Novak, the turning point came when he visited Syracuse University to lecture. Before he spoke, he was seated at a dinner table near a female student who wore a cross necklace. Novak {{asked her if she}} was Catholic and she asked him the same. Novak said he had been going to Mass each Sunday for the last four years, but had not converted. “Mr Novak,” the young woman replied, “life is short, but eternity is forever.” <b>That</b> <b>brief</b> sentence chilled Novak, who felt the student had channeled the Holy Spirit. When he got home and told Geraldine, they {{decided it was time to}} convert. In May 1998 Novak was received into the Roman Catholic Church at the age of 67 and became a Traditionalist Catholic. Geraldine was already a Catholic. Al Hunt, Judy Woodruff, Fred Barnes, Margaret Carlson, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Henry Hyde, and Rick Santorum attended Novak’s baptism, with some of them openly crying.|$|E
25|$|Despite <b>that</b> <b>brief</b> run-out at centre-forward, McPherson played {{exclusively}} at outside left in 1924–25, missing {{just four}} games. He {{was also a}} more prolific goalscorer, his seven goals in 38 league appearances helping the club to a second-place finish {{at the end of}} the season and promotion back to the First Division. He began the following season as the starting outside left, playing in the first seven games before the re-emergence of Harry Thomas cost him his place, starting with the game against Burnley on 26 September 1925. McPherson made a goalscoring return to the team as a centre-forward on 24 October, scoring twice in a 2–0 away win over Cardiff City; he retained the number 9 shirt for much of the rest of the season, before a three-game spell without scoring culminated in a 7–0 defeat away to Blackburn Rovers; Charlie Rennox, Jimmy Hanson and Chris Taylor shared centre-forward duties for the remaining six games of the season. Despite being dropped for the final six games, McPherson finished the season with a career-high 16 league goals, and a further four in the FA Cup, in which Manchester United reached the semi-finals before being knocked out by rivals Manchester City. McPherson's new-found scoring form was attributed to his pace, coupled with a change to the offside law, which now only required two defenders between the attacking player and the opposing goal line for the attacker to be onside.|$|E

25|$|The Washington Post {{reported}} that amid a slower-than-anticipated recovery for left fielder Jayson Werth from a bruised foot suffered the previous month, Werth said on July 18 that scans had revealed a fracture {{of his first}} metatarsal bone {{as well as a}} bone bruise. The Nationals made a series of roster moves on July 18 as well: Turner was designated for assignment for the second time of the month, just a day after being re-added to the roster and without appearing in a game in <b>that</b> <b>brief</b> stint, while Adams and Gott were optioned back to Class-AAA Syracuse. Those roster moves cleared room for the Nationals to activate Doolittle and Madson as well as select the contract of Edwin Jackson from Syracuse, tabbing Jackson to start the first of their two-game interleague series against the Angels. The changes to the pitching staff left the Nationals unusually heavy on left-handed relievers, with four in the bullpen (Doolittle, Grace, Pérez, and Enny Romero) to three right-handers (Albers, Joe Blanton, and Madson). Making his first start for the Nationals since the 2012 season, Jackson pitched seven innings and gave up two earned runs, both on solo home runs, to earn his first win of the season. Doolittle gave up his first hit of the year to a left-handed hitter, a double high off the wall by Kole Calhoun, but nailed down the save after allowing an earned run in his first appearance for Washington. Harper came a close call at second base away from hitting for the cycle in the July 18 contest, as he was called out trying to stretch a single into a double while going 4-for-4 overall with a home run and a triple.|$|E

500|$|The History of The Baltimore City College {{began in}} March 1839, when the City Council of Baltimore, Maryland, United States, passed a {{resolution}} mandating {{the creation of a}} male high school with a focus on the study of English and classical literature. [...] "The High School" [...] (later becoming The Baltimore City College) was opened later in the same year on October 20, with 46 pupils under the direction of Professor Nathan C. Brooks,(1809-1898), a local noted classical educator and poet, who became the first principal of a new type of higher institution in the developing public education system in the city begun in 1829. It is now considered to be the third oldest public high school / secondary school in the nation. In 1850, the Baltimore City Council granted the school, then known as the [...] "Central High School of Baltimore", the authority to present its graduates with certificates of completion. An effort to expand that academic power and allow the then named [...] "Central High School of Baltimore" [...] to confer Bachelor of Arts degrees began following the Civil War in 1865, and continued the following year with the renaming of the institution as [...] "The Baltimore City College", which it still holds to this day, with also the retitling of its chief academic officer from [...] "principal" [...] to [...] "president", along with {{an increase in the number}} of years of its course of study and the expansion of its courses. However, despite this early elevation effort, it ended at <b>that</b> <b>brief</b> period unsuccessfully in 1869, although the B.C.C. continued for a number of years as a hybrid public high school and early form of junior college (later known as community college) which did not fully appear in America in different form until the beginning of the 20th century. Very often the elaborate decorative fancy engraved graduation diploma from the B.C.C. in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was accepted by many other colleges and universities entitling City graduates to enter upper-division schools at the sophomore year, (which was also coincidentally a privilege also accorded to its later local academic and athletic rival for 127 years - [...] "Poly", the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, founded 1883 as the Baltimore Manual Training School, later renamed 1893).|$|E
