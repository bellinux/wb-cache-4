More of a Cinderella than a princess, I fancy, and leads a hard life of it between Miss Dolly and the second Mrs. Hill. Wonder what happy fellow will break the spell and set her free?"

500|$|The song {{appeared}} in two shows of 1918: Yip Yip Yaphank and Ziegfeld Follies of 1918. Yip Yip Yaphank opened on August 19 and Berlin made his entrance {{late in the}} show, being dragged from a pup tent by two other soldiers as he pretended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asleep</b> on his feet to sing [...] "Oh!

500|$|Parsons {{agreed to}} move his {{daughter}} to Aldrich's house for further testing on 22January, but when that morning Penn and a man of [...] "veracity and fortune" [...] called on Parsons and asked for Elizabeth, the clerk told them she was not there and refused to reveal her whereabouts. [...] Parsons had spoken with friends and was apparently worried that Kent had been busy with his own investigations. [...] Instead, he allowed Elizabeth to be moved that night to St Bartholomew's Hospital, where another séance was held. [...] Nothing was reported until about 6am, when three scratches were heard, apparently while the girl was asleep. [...] The approximately 20-strong audience complained that the affair was a deception. [...] Once Elizabeth woke she began to cry, and once reassured that she was safe admitted that she was afraid for her father, [...] "who must needs be ruined and undone, if their matter should be {{supposed to be an}} imposture." [...] She also admitted that although she had appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asleep,</b> she was in fact fully aware of the conversation going on around her.|$|E
500|$|One day, the {{adolescent}} Tubman {{was sent to}} a dry-goods store for supplies. There, she encountered a slave owned by another family, who had left the fields without permission. His overseer, furious, demanded that she help restrain him. She refused, and as he ran away, the overseer threw a two-pound weight at him. He struck her instead, which she said [...] "broke my skull." [...] She later explained her belief that her hair – which [...] "had never been combed and...stood out like a bushel basket" [...] – might have saved her life. Bleeding and unconscious, she was returned to her owner's house and laid on the seat of a loom, where she remained without medical care for two days. She was sent back into the fields, [...] "with blood and sweat rolling down my face until I couldn't see." [...] Her boss said she was [...] "not worth a sixpence" [...] and returned her to Brodess, who tried unsuccessfully to sell her. She began having seizures and would seemingly fall unconscious, although she claimed to be aware of her surroundings while appearing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asleep.</b> These episodes were alarming to her family, who were unable to wake her when she fell asleep suddenly and without warning. This condition remained with her {{for the rest of her}} life; Larson suggests she may have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy as a result of the injury.|$|E

2500|$|The plot of {{the film}} is largely {{unchanged}} from that of Shakespeare's original play.
