5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lime</b> Walk, {{constructed}} by previous estate owner Margaret Chinnery, surrounds the Training Ground {{which was the}} original main lawn area of the White House. Few of <b>the</b> <b>Lime</b> trees survive to this day. On this path sits the Jim Green Gate, a 1930 tribute to Jim Green, an editor of The Scouter magazine.|$|E
5|$|In {{his search}} for <b>the</b> <b>lime,</b> Scott discovers a strange, {{swirling}} cloud of dust that absorbs moisture. He follows it until he collapses {{in front of a}} lake bed. He has a brief hallucination where he engages in a spiritual conversation with a priest he knew on Earth. Meanwhile, the cloud moves up to him and condenses into water, waking him. Realizing what he's found, Scott shovels as much of <b>the</b> <b>lime</b> as possible into his bag and makes his way to the Gate. Greer, having set out to look for him, finds him along the way and helps carry <b>the</b> <b>lime.</b> Wallace sticks his arm into the wormhole to delay the countdown. The team returns with <b>the</b> <b>lime</b> successfully, which is used to repair the CO2 scrubbers. In the end, a recovering Scott tells Chloe that his parents and the priest died when he was young, and {{that the best way to}} deal with the grief is to keep moving forward. As everyone starts to breathe easier, a ship detaches itself from the Destiny.|$|E

5|$|Despite the resounding {{negative}} feedback from fans, this kit was initially confirmed for the 2012 season. On 6 September 2011, however, the club announced {{a change of}} heart—they would be returning to their traditional blue strip for home matches, and using <b>the</b> <b>lime</b> green kit for away matches during the 2012 Super Rugby season.|$|E
5|$|Land was {{developed}} for housing outside the walls including the Cornwall Estate, between the Borough Gardens and the Great Western Railway from 1876 and the Prince of Wales Estate from 1880. Land for the Victoria Park Estate was bought in 1896 and building began in 1897, Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee year. <b>The</b> <b>lime</b> trees in Queen's Avenue were planted in February 1897.|$|E
5|$|The cost {{of phase}} 2 {{of the project}} was {{approximately}} £18million, however the BBC does not own the building, they have leased it for 25 years from <b>the</b> <b>Lime</b> Property Fund, which is a subsidiary of Aviva Investors.

50|$|With Diocletian <b>the</b> <b>limes</b> was {{partially}} abandoned {{and the defense}} of the area was done even by the Limitanei, local berber soldier-farmers. <b>The</b> <b>Limes</b> survived as an effective protection until Byzantine times (Emperor Justinian restructured <b>the</b> <b>Limes</b> in 533 AD.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Limes</b> Saxoniae (Latin for [...] "Limit of Saxony"), {{also known}} as <b>the</b> <b>Limes</b> Saxonicus or Sachsenwall ("Saxon Dyke"), was an unfortified limes or border between the Saxons and the Slavic Obotrites, {{established}} about 810 in present-day Schleswig-Holstein.|$|R
5|$|The {{building}} to the north-west of Exeter Hill, which formerly housed the water-powered bark mill, is now an antiques warehouse {{and the remains of}} the leat and tail race can still be seen. This side of the site was also the location of <b>the</b> <b>lime</b> yard. The other half of the site, to the south-east of Exeter Hill, which was the location of the tan yard, is now the site of an Aldi supermarket.|$|E
5|$|The red poppies that McCrae {{referred}} to had {{been associated with}} conflict since the Napoleonic Wars when a writer of that time first noted how the poppies grew over the graves of soldiers. The damage done to the landscape in Flanders during the battle greatly increased <b>the</b> <b>lime</b> content in the surface soil, leaving the poppy {{as one of the}} few plants able to grow in the region.|$|E
5|$|Variations of the pisco sour {{exist in}} Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. There are adaptations of the {{cocktail}} in Peru using fruits such as maracuya, aguaymanto, and apples, or traditional ingredients {{such as the}} coca leaf. In Chile, variants include the Ají Sour (with a spicy green chili), Mango Sour (with mango juice), and Sour de Campo (with ginger and honey). In Bolivia, the Yunqueño variant (from its Yungas region) replaces <b>the</b> <b>lime</b> with orange juice.|$|E
50|$|The first fort on <b>the</b> <b>limes</b> {{was built}} at Thiges, to protect from nomad attacks in 75 AD. <b>The</b> <b>limes</b> was {{expanded}} under emperors Hadrian and Septimius Severus, in particular under the legatus Quintus Anicius Faustus in 197-201 AD.|$|R
50|$|Bodegraven {{was already}} {{inhabited}} in the Roman Era. It was {{situated at the}} Roman Empire's northern border, <b>the</b> <b>Limes</b> Germanicus. As such, many army camps, ports, and roads were built by the Romans. Many settlements originated on the road along <b>the</b> <b>Limes,</b> including Bodegraven.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> word <b>limes</b> was {{utilized}} by Latin writers to denote a marked or fortified frontier. This sense has been adapted and extended by modern historians {{concerned with the}} frontiers of the Roman Empire: e.g. Hadrian's Wall {{in the north of}} England is sometimes styled <b>the</b> <b>Limes</b> Britannicus, <b>the</b> frontier of the Roman province of Arabia facing the desert is called <b>the</b> <b>Limes</b> Arabicus, and so forth.|$|R
5|$|Stone keep {{construction}} required skilled craftsmen. Unlike {{timber and}} earthworks, {{which could be}} built using unfree labour or serfs, these craftsmen had to be paid and stone keeps were therefore expensive. They were also relatively slow to erect, due to the limitations of <b>the</b> <b>lime</b> mortar used during the period – a keep's walls could usually be raised by a maximum of only 12 feet (3.6 metres) a year; the keep at Scarborough was not atypical in taking ten years to build. The number of such keeps remained relatively low: in England, for example, although several early stone keeps had been built after the conquest, there were only somewhere between ten and fifteen in existence by 1100, and only around a hundred had been built by 1216.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{gardens and}} {{pleasure}} grounds are situated {{close to the}} house, with an area of informal pleasure grounds extending to the south-east. Two features are the Cedar Walk and <b>the</b> <b>Lime</b> Walk, both majestic avenues {{to the south of}} the house, as well as a plantation known as Blind Wood. There is a terrace {{in front of the house}} with urns and vases, overlooking an extensive lawned area. Other features include a Victorian fernery and a sunken garden. To the west of the house, there is a rose garden with a central circular lawn. The kitchen garden lies to the south of the pleasure grounds and is now a commercial nursery. The house and gardens are open to the public and in 2012 received about 230,000 visitors.|$|E
5|$|The men {{inside them}} paddled fast on the treadmills, and the ships glided {{forwards}} {{as though they}} were flying, yet no one was visible on board. The enemy thought that they were made of paper. Then all of a sudden a thunderclap bomb was let off. It was made with paper (carton) and filled with lime and sulphur. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a noise like thunder, the sulphur bursting into flames. The carton case rebounded and broke, scattering <b>the</b> <b>lime</b> to form a smoky fog, which blinded the eyes of men and horses so that they could see nothing. Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so that they were utterly defeated.|$|E
50|$|In Dacia, <b>the</b> <b>limes</b> between <b>the</b> Black Sea and the Danube were {{a mix of}} {{the camps}} and the wall defenses: <b>the</b> <b>Limes</b> Moesiae was <b>the</b> {{conjunction}} of two, and sometimes three, lines of vallum, with a Great Camp and many minor camps spread through the fortifications.|$|R
5000|$|A centenarium {{is a type}} of Ancient Roman {{fortified}} {{farmhouse in}} <b>the</b> <b>Limes</b> Tripolitanus. It is called even in the plural Centenaria, because in <b>the</b> <b>Limes</b> Tripolitanus there were more than 2000 of these [...] "fortifications", connected to create a defensive system against desert tribe raids.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Main <b>Limes</b> (Mainlimes), {{also called}} <b>the</b> Nasser <b>Limes,</b> was built around 90 A. D. and, {{as part of}} <b>the</b> Upper Germanic-Rhaetian <b>Limes,</b> formed <b>the</b> {{frontier}} of the Roman Empire in the area between the present day villages of Großkrotzenburg and Bürgstadt. In this section <b>the</b> <b>limes</b> adjoined <b>the</b> River Main (Moenus), which forms a natural boundary for about 50 kilometres here.|$|R
5|$|The {{total cost}} of the {{expedition}} was estimated at £90,000 (2009 equivalent about £7.25 million), of which £45,000 was offered by the British Government provided that the two Societies could raise a matching sum. They achieved this, thanks largely to a donation of £25,000 from wealthy RGS member Llewellyn W. Longstaff. The RGS itself contributed £8,000, its largest single contribution to any expedition to that date, and £5,000 came from Alfred Harmsworth, later Lord Northcliffe, who had earlier financed the Jackson-Harmsworth expedition to the Arctic, 1894–97. The rest was raised from smaller donations. The expedition also benefited from significant commercial sponsorship: Colman's provided mustard and flour, Cadbury's gave 3,500lb (1,600kg) of chocolate, Bird's donated baking and custard powders, Evans, Lescher & Webb provided all <b>the</b> <b>lime</b> juice. Jaeger gave a 40% discount on special clothing, Bovril supplied beef extract, and others made significant contributions.|$|E
5|$|Time, wear, {{and severe}} weather {{conditions}} led to many identified problems, {{the single most}} pervasive being water damage. In building a memorial made of cast concrete covered in stone, Allward had failed {{to take into account}} how these materials would shift over time. The builders and designer failed to incorporate sufficient space between the concrete and stones, which resulted in water infiltrating the structure through its walls and platforms, dissolving lime in the concrete foundation and masonry. As the water exited, it deposited <b>the</b> <b>lime</b> on exterior surfaces, obscuring many of the names inscribed thereon. Poor drainage and water flows off the monument also caused significant deterioration of the platform, terrace, and stairs. The restoration project intended to address the root causes of damage and included repairs to the stone, walkways, walls, terraces, stairs, and platforms. In order to respect Allward's initial vision of a seamless structure, the restoration team were required to remove all foreign materials employed in patchwork repairs, replace damaged stones with material from the original quarry in Croatia, and correct all minor displacement of stones caused by the freeze-thaw activity. Underlying structural flaws were also corrected.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>limes</b> {{itself is}} a {{relatively}} simple construction. It {{is similar to the}} fortification that a travelling troop of Roman soldiers would construct every evening to protect their camp from attacks. On the outside, the soldiers dug a ditch. The earth from the ditch was used to build a mound. On top of the mound stakes were attached. <b>The</b> <b>Limes</b> had a deeper ditch and a higher mound. The stakes were higher too and in front of the ditch while on several parts of <b>the</b> <b>limes,</b> instead of stakes there was a simple stone wall.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> Roman <b>limes</b> from <b>the</b> {{county of}} Bistrița-Năsăud {{is part of}} <b>the</b> Porolissensis <b>Limes</b> and extends along a line {{connecting}} the villages Ciceu Corabia, Negrilești, Ciceu Poieni, Dobric, Spermezeu, Zagra, Salva, Năsăud, Livezile, and Orheiul Bistriței. It features specific elements, represented by Roman roads, watchtowers, burgi, and castra. Geographically, this section of <b>the</b> <b>limes</b> lies in a hilly area, represented by the Someșul Mare Hills (Ciceu Hills, Suplai Hills, Năsăud Hills) and the Bistrița Hills. The touristic and leisure value of <b>the</b> <b>Limes</b> from <b>the</b> county of Bistrița-Năsăud is given by the geographical features of the region (relief, climate, vegetation) and by the Roman vestiges discovered in the area. The present paper focus on <b>the</b> <b>limes</b> section stretching between the Ilișua Valley (at Spermezeu) and the Someșul Mare River (at Năsăud), and aims to identify, catalogue, and evaluate elements of <b>the</b> Roman <b>limes,</b> and to elaborate touristic utilisation strategies of the archaeological sites.
