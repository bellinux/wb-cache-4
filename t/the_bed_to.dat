5|$|In 1917, Texas filed a {{trespass}} to try title suit {{to reclaim}} the lake bed for the state. In Welder v. State, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Austin declared the lake permanent and navigable-in-fact, granting <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> the state under {{the purview of the}} Texas Game, Fish and Oyster Commission (later Texas Parks and Wildlife Department). Without permission from the Texas Attorney General, the Texas Land Commissioner then sold <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> a private buyer for agricultural use in 1918. In the 1948 case of State v. Bryan, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Austin upheld the sale as valid under color of law, and immune from a trespass to try title suit due to the one-year statute of limitations on land sales. However, under the Texas Water Rights Adjudication Act of 1967, Green Lake was classified as a public body of water. The Supreme Court of Texas affirmed this classification in 1988, rejecting the argument of the bed's then-owner {{that it was not a}} lake by definition, but a natural depression flooded with surface runoff.|$|E
5|$|Nuyts {{acquired}} some notoriety while Governor for apparently taking native {{women to}} his bed, {{and having a}} translator hide under <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> interpret his pillow-talk. He was also accused of profiting from private trade, something which was forbidden under company rules. Some sources claim that he officially married a native Formosan woman during this time, but as he was still legally married to his first wife Cornelia, this seems unlikely.|$|E
5|$|After the American Civil War, {{returning}} residents {{found that}} their slaves, livestock and farm equipment had been taken. Most residents relocated. However, in the early 20th century, farmers returned {{and the town of}} Green Lake modestly grew to an approximate population of 300 in 1914. At the time, much of the land in the vicinity was used for livestock grazing. The only profitable commercial uses for the lake itself included transportation of lumber and fishing. Approximately US$100,000 worth of fish were caught in the lake from 1900 to 1915. Nevertheless, the lake bed remained dry for extended periods and vegetation covered certain areas. Local residents soon began to use <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> grow cotton.|$|E

25|$|While Shakespeare closely {{followed}} Cinthio's tale in composing Othello, he departed {{from it in}} some details. In Cinthio's tale, for example, the ensign suffers an unrequited lust for the Moor's wife, Desdemona, which then drives his vengeance. Desdemona dies {{in an entirely different}} manner in Cinthio's tale; the Moor commissions his ensign to bludgeon her to death with a sand-filled stocking. In gruesome detail, Cinthio follows each blow, and, when she is dead, the Moor and his ensign place her lifeless body upon her bed, smash her skull, and then cause the cracked ceiling above <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> collapse upon her, giving the impression the falling rafters caused her death.|$|E
500|$|That night, Theo {{moves into}} Eleanor's room and they fall {{asleep in the}} same bed. [...] Eleanor is awakened by {{the sounds of a}} man {{speaking}} indistinctly and a woman laughing. [...] Fearful, Eleanor asks Theo to hold her hand and she feels it being crushed. As Eleanor hears the sound of a young girl crying, she shouts at whoever is causing the child pain. Theo awakens with a start and turns on the light. Eleanor then sees that she has moved from <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> the couch, and realizes that Theo was not the one she felt holding her hand.|$|E
500|$|The {{portion of}} NY31 in {{downtown}} Rochester between Brown Street and South Avenue {{runs along the}} old path of the Erie Canal through the city. When the canal was diverted to bypass {{the city to the}} south in 1920, the canal bed became part of the Rochester Subway while a [...] bridge was built over <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> carry a new street named Broad Street. None of Broad Street was initially part of NY31, however; when NY31 replaced NY3 west of Rochester , it entered the city by way of NY3's old routing on Lyell Avenue and rejoined its original alignment at State Street. In the late 1930s, NY31 was realigned through downtown to follow Smith and Bausch Streets east across the Genesee River and St. Paul Street and South Avenue south to Woodbury Boulevard, which at the time connected to Monroe Avenue one block to the east at South Clinton Avenue. NY31 was altered once again [...] to leave Lyell Avenue at Broad Street and follow West and East Broad Streets through downtown to South Avenue.|$|E

2500|$|On 17 July 2015, Cattrall {{was cast}} {{in the title role}} of the play Linda, written by Penelope Skinner, {{directed}} by Michael Longhurst, and produced at the Royal Court Theatre in London. [...] She was forced to drop out of that production {{a few days before the}} opening, due to “chronic, debilitating insomnia”. She then returned to New York, and started a program of cognitive behaviour therapy to train herself to be able to sleep better. The therapy was successful; it included developing certain evening rituals, removing electronic devices from her bedroom, and limiting the use of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> two activities, one of which would be sleeping. Her part in the play, Linda was recast, her part played by Noma Dumezweni, and it opened in December 2015.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{pre-operative}} holding area, {{the patient}} changes {{out of his}} or her street clothes and is asked to confirm the details {{of his or her}} surgery. A set of vital signs are recorded, a peripheral IV line is placed, and pre-operative medications (antibiotics, sedatives, etc.) are given. When the patient enters the operating room, the skin surface to be operated on, called the operating field, is cleaned and prepared by applying an antiseptic such as chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone-iodine to reduce the possibility of infection. If hair is present at the surgical site, it is clipped off prior to prep application. The patient is assisted by an anesthesiologist or resident to make a specific surgical position, then sterile drapes are used to cover the surgical site or at least a wide area surrounding the operating field; the drapes are clipped to a pair of poles near the head of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> form an [...] "ether screen", which separates the anesthetist/anesthesiologist's working area (unsterile) from the surgical site (sterile).|$|E

40|$|A-moving bed coal {{gasifier}} {{for the production}} of tar-free, low ammonia fuel gas is described. The gasifier employs a combustion zone in a free-aboard area above <b>the</b> moving <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> burn coal fines to provide hot combustion gases for pyrolyzing and gasifying coal particulates in <b>the</b> moving <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> form fuel gas as the hot gases move co-currently with the downwardly moving coal particulates. The fuel gas contains entrained tars and ammonia compounds which contact hot char and ash in <b>the</b> moving <b>bed</b> and are cracked so that the fuel gas removed from the gasifier at a midpoint off-take is essentially tar-free and of low ammonia content. Concurrently with this gasification reaction, steam and an oxidant are introduced into a region below <b>the</b> moving <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> flow countercurrently <b>to</b> <b>the</b> downwardly moving <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> contact and react with carbon remaining in the char to create additional fuel gas which is also extracted from the gasifier at the mid-point off-take...|$|R
2500|$|Koehler's design had {{the further}} {{advantage}} of absorbing the recoil caused by firing the gun. Ordinary carriages had no mechanism to absorb this recoil. The entire gun and mount would jump violently, causing the gun crew {{to have to}} reposition it before they could fire the next shot. Koehler's carriage mounted the gun on a sliding bed attached to {{the main body of}} the carriage via a vertical spindle. Firing the cannon forced <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> slide upwards, rather than making the entire carriage recoil. As an eyewitness, John Drinkwater, noted, [...] "the carriage, when the gun was depressed, seldom moved; the gun sliding upon the plank to which it was attached by the spindle, and returning to its former place with the most trifling assistance." [...] This system was a forerunner of the recoil systems that are standard features of modern artillery pieces. The gun could be reversed on the carriage and fired upwards at angles of up to 45°, though according to Drinkwater [...] "in that state [...] did not particularly excel." [...] The design also enabled gunners to reload the cannon without exposing themselves to enemy fire, by rotating the sliding bed sideways.|$|E
2500|$|While Shakespeare closely {{followed}} Cinthio's tale in composing Othello, he departed {{from it in}} some details, particularly in the tale's depiction of Desdemona's death. [...] In Cinthio, the Moor commissions his ensign to bludgeon Desdemona {{to death with a}} sand-filled stocking. In gruesome detail, Cinthio follows each blow, and, when the lady is dead, the Moor and his ensign place her lifeless body upon her bed, smash her skull, and then cause the cracked ceiling above <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> collapse upon her, giving the impression the falling rafters caused her death. The two murderers escape detection. [...] The Moor then misses his wife greatly, and comes to loathe the sight of his ensign. [...] He demotes him, and refuses to have him in his company. [...] The ensign then seeks revenge by disclosing to [...] "the squadron leader" [...] (the tale's Cassio counterpart), the Moor's involvement in Desdemona's death. [...] The two men denounce the Moor to the Venetian Seignory. [...] The Moor is arrested, transported from Cyprus to Venice, and tortured, but refuses to admit his guilt. [...] He is condemned to exile; Desdemona's relatives eventually put him to death. The ensign escapes any prosecution in Desdemona's death but engages in other crimes and dies after being tortured.|$|E
