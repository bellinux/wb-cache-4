50|$|This {{starting}} method inspired Porsche {{to locate the}} ignition key switch {{to the left of}} the steering wheel. In a left-hand drive car, this allowed the driver to use his left hand to start the engine, and his right hand <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the transmission <b>into</b> <b>gear,</b> which in turn shaves off a few tenths of a second.|$|R
50|$|Another {{difference}} between semi-trucks and cars {{is the way}} the clutch is set up. On an automobile, the clutch pedal is depressed full stroke to the floor for every gear shift, to ensure the gearbox is disengaged from the engine. On a semi-truck with constant mesh transmission (non synchronized), such as by the Eaton Roadranger series, not only is double clutching required, but a clutch brake is required as well. The clutch brake stops the rotation of the gears, and allows the truck <b>to</b> be <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>gear</b> without grinding when stationary. The clutch is pressed to the floor only to allow smooth engagement of low gears when starting from a full stop; when the truck is moving, the clutch pedal is pressed only far enough to break torque for gear changes.|$|R

5000|$|Early systems {{locked and}} {{unlocked}} only the car doors. Many cars today also feature systems which can unlock {{such things as the}} luggage compartment or fuel filler cap door. It is also common on modern cars for the locks to activate automatically when the car is <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>gear</b> or reaches a certain speed.|$|R
5|$|Family {{tensions}} {{play out}} on the highway and at stops along the way, amidst the aging VW van's mechanical problems. When the van breaks down early on, the family learns that they must push the van until it is moving at about 20mph before it is <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>gear,</b> at which point they have to run up to the side door and jump in. Later on, the van's horn starts honking unceasingly by itself.|$|R
50|$|The bike {{has a large}} rear {{sprocket}} {{and produces}} usable torque at low rpm. Instrumentation included a speedometer, odometer with trip, high beam, turn indicators, and a gear position indicator. The engine automatically shuts off if the bike is <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>gear</b> when side stand is down. The Suzuki GZ250 is a more cruiser oriented version of GN250 in terms of dimensions with same drivetrain. Suzuki TU250 is a modern evolution of this bike with EFI and different styling.|$|R
5000|$|Although it is a {{very old}} design, the Powerglide still has a strong {{following}} in drag racing due to its strength and simplicity. Powerglides are also popular in mud racing and monster truck racing. In the first few years after introduction, they became known as the [...] "Slip-N-Slide Powerglide", due to the fluid coupling, as opposed to the mechanical coupling of a clutch-driven gearbox, and the [...] "Positive-Pop transmission". This last is due to the characteristic [...] "bump" [...] or [...] "pop" [...] which occurs as the transmission is <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>gear</b> from neutral.|$|R
50|$|Next {{the main}} {{transmission}} is <b>put</b> <b>into</b> its direct <b>gear</b> (usually {{the second highest}} or highest gear).|$|R
25|$|Connection is then {{established}} between the attenuated rovings and the spindles. When {{the latter are}} bare, as in a new mule, the spindle-driving motion is <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>gear,</b> and the attendants wind upon each spindle a short length of yarn from a cop held in the hand. The drawing-roller motion is placed in gear, and the rollers soon present lengths of attenuated roving. These {{are attached to the}} threads on the spindles, by simply placing the threads in contact with the un-twisted roving. The different parts of the machine are next simultaneously started, when the whole works in harmony together.|$|R
25|$|On July 23, 2013, Transport Canada {{issued an}} {{emergency}} directive requiring {{at least two}} persons operate trains carrying tank cars of dangerous materials, prohibiting dangerous material trains left on the mainline unattended, requiring locomotive cabs on unattended trains be locked and reverser handles removed to prevent the train being <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>gear,</b> imposing requirements for setting hand brakes on trains unattended {{for more than an}} hour and requiring both the automatic brake (train brake) and independent brake (locomotive brake) be applied at their maximum force for trains unattended for an hour or less. A ministerial emergency directive remains in effect for six months, although it can be renewed.|$|R

50|$|The single {{circumstance}} {{under which}} a Teletouch could be <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>gear</b> {{with the car}} moving at greater than three to five miles per hour was if the neutral button was depressed first, thereby removing hydraulic pressure from the inhibitor switch, and then the reverse or park button pushed. These actions would, as a result, either shear off the parking pawl or suddenly set the rear wheels turning in the reverse direction, effectively locking them up against the road surface and possibly damaging the reverse bands in the transmission. Ironically, the failed Autolite Packard system protected against this set of circumstances by locking out not only reverse and park, but also neutral while the car was moving with any significant speed.|$|R
5000|$|... 1993 brought minimal {{changes to}} the Cavalier line. The {{convertibles}} receive a glass rear window, allowing rear window defrost as an option. [...] Also, General Motors received a new grille for the final time in this generation of the Chevrolet Cavalier.1994 models were also carryovers, as a redesign of the Cavalier was in development. The VL trim was dropped on the wagon, while the 2.2 L OHV L4 was now converted to the SFI version found in the Corsica, which delivered an output of 120 horsepower. Additional changes included a slightly redesigned climate control interface and the power locking system being again redesigned: the doors would still lock automatically when <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>gear,</b> but they would also unlock automatically when the ignition was switched off.|$|R
