The site was inaugurated in 1927 and now has transmitters for 243 kHz longwave with 300 kW and 1062 kHz mediumwave with 250 kW plus a common reserve transmitter. For the longwave transmitter an Alexanderson aerial is used, with two grounded 118 m steel lattice radiating towers connected by top capacitance wires. The northern tower is fed from the transmitter through a <b>top</b> <b>coil,</b> with the <b>top</b> <b>coil</b> of the southern slave tower being fed via the capacitance wires.The medium wave transmitter uses an insulated guyed steel lattice mast aerial with a height of 147 metres.

50|$|Underground at Cavendish Square, {{there is}} a car park with spaces for 521 cars and 83 motorcycles. Operated by Q-Park, it is {{designated}} their car park for Oxford Street. The car park is unusual as it has {{the form of a}} double helix (a twin-start screw). Cars are parked on either side of a continuously descending right-hand helix with one-way traffic. At the bottom, cars are directed diametrically across the car-park, to find a left-hand ascending helix, also one-way with parking on either side, sandwiched between the turns of the descending helix. Since there is no pedestrian lift (as of 2013), parking near the beginning of the descending helix, or {{near the end of the}} ascending one, is preferred. But since it is impossible to see in advance whether there are any spaces remaining in the <b>top</b> <b>coils</b> of the ascending helix, the decision of how far to proceed is usually sub-optimal.|$|R

5000|$|The clearomizer {{was invented}} in 2009 that {{originated}} from the cartomizer design. It contained the wicking material, an e-liquid chamber, and an atomizer coil within a single clear component. This allows the user to monitor the liquid level in the device. Clearomizers or [...] "clearos", are like cartotanks, in that an atomizer is inserted into the tank. There are different wicking systems used inside clearomizers. Some rely on gravity to bring the e-liquid to the wick and coil assembly (bottom coil clearomizers for example) and others rely on capillary action or to some degree the user agitating the e-liquid while handling the clearomizer (<b>top</b> <b>coil</b> clearomizers). The coil and wicks are typically inside a prefabricated assembly or [...] "head" [...] that is replaceable by the user.|$|E
40|$|Ultrasound {{treatment}} {{is used in}} light alloys during solidification to refine microstructure, remove gas, or disperse immersed particles. A mechanical sonotrode immersed in the melt is most effective when probe tip vibrations lead to cavitation. Liquid contact with the probe can be problematic for high temperature or reactive melts leading to contamination. An alternative contactless method of generating ultrasonic waves is proposed, using electromagnetic (EM) induction. As a bonus, the EM force induces vigorous stirring distributing the effect to treat larger volumes of material. In a typical application, the induction coil surrounding the crucible— also used to melt the alloy—may be adopted for this purpose with suitable tuning. Alternatively, a <b>top</b> <b>coil,</b> immersed in the melt (but still contactless due to EM force repulsion) may be used. Numerical simulations of sound, flow, and EM fields suggest that large pressure amplitudes leading to cavitation may be achievable with this method...|$|E

40|$|Etching of {{semiconductor}} {{materials is}} reliant on plasma properties. Quantities such as ion and neutral fluxes, both in magnitude and in direction, are often determined by reactor geometry (height, radius, {{position of the}} coils, etc.) In order to obtain accurate etching profiles, one must also model the plasma as a whole to obtain local fluxes and distributions. We have developed a set of three models that simulates C 12 plasmas for etching of silicon, ion and neutral trajectories in the plasma, and feature profile evolution. We {{have found that the}} location of the peak in the ion densities in the reactor {{plays a major role in}} determining etching uniformity across the wafer. For a stove <b>top</b> <b>coil</b> inductively coupled plasma (ICP), the ion density is peaked at the top of the reactor. This leads to nearly uniform neutral and ion fluxes across the wafer. A side coil configuration causes the ion density to peak near the sidewalls. Ion fluxes are thus greater toward the wall's and decrease toward the center. In addition, the ions bombard the wafer at a slight angle. This angle is sufficient to cause slanted profiles, which is highly undesirable...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe AC {{electromagnetic}} field effects in molten metal are investigated {{to account for}} the mixing of particles (grain refiners, micro/nano additives, impurities, broken metal dendrite agglomerates, bubbles) during the full melting/solidification cycle. The particles travel due to the hydrodynamic drag, buoyancy, turbulent fluctuations and the electromagnetic force action via the local pressure distribution around the particle. The time average effects are investigated previously using approximation derived for a uniform electric and magnetic fields. In the presence of AC field the force distribution is non-uniform, confined to an exponential skin-layer near the outer surface of liquid. This typically results in high mixing rates and an intense turbulence in the bulk of molten metal, additionally contributing to the particle dispersion. The paper attempts to demonstrate the importance of each of the mentioned effects to the organized particle ‘swarm’ like transport and the eventual distribution. Three different examples of the mixing flows generated by AC fields are presented: a travelling field stirring during directional solidification, the semi-levitation dynamic melting and the contactless <b>top</b> <b>coil</b> ‘immersion’ mixing involving the dynamic AC field adjustment. The Lagrangian particle tracking in the presence of strong AC electromagnetic force field gives new perspectives {{to the understanding of the}} melting and casting processes...|$|E

50|$|When {{the core}} is {{displaced}} toward the top, the voltage in the <b>top</b> secondary <b>coil</b> increases as the voltage {{in the bottom}} decreases. The resulting output voltage increases from zero. This voltage is in phase with the primary voltage. When the core moves in the other direction, the output voltage also increases from zero, but its phase is opposite {{to that of the}} primary. The phase of the output voltage determines the direction of the displacement (up or down) and amplitude indicates the amount of displacement. A synchronous detector can determine a signed output voltage that relates to the displacement.|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth in the {{wireless}} industry there has been increasing demand to make devices with better performance. This means lower power, lower voltage, smaller, and in general more efficient. This has lead to the interest in and necessity for good quality passive components. Good quality passive components make better filters, baluns, voltage controlled oscillators, and matching networks. 	There {{has been a lot}} of work over the last ten years focused on improving the quality of inductors. Typical inductors fabricated on silicon have Q factors of approximately 10. This is because silicon is conductive and therefore acts like a lossy ground plane and develops interfering currents. Improvements that have been attempted include thicker metal layers, thicker dielectric layers, patterned ground shields, as well as using multiple metal layers. These methods, however, still do not improve inductors to the quality of those built on insulating substrates such as glass. The main successful attempt on silicon has been where the inductor coil is released so that it is in the air supported by posts. In some work the inductor coil is raised 50 to 100 µm above the underpass by methods like etching or photoresist molding. The suspended inductor approach was applied to an insulating substrate to fabricate and characterize unique suspended inductors and transformers. Inductors were released to have 1 µm of air underneath the coil by the use of a release etch. Transformers were made in a similar way except two released layers where used. The <b>top</b> <b>coil,</b> done in plated gold, was released as well as an interconnection layer. Such a small air gap and the transformers with two released metal layers are a couple of the unique features of this thesis work. The devices were characterized up to 20 GHz before and after release. An improvement in the peak Q factor (up to 70), as well as in the self-resonance frequency (up to 4 GHz higher) was noticed after release. This is expected due to the reduction in parasitics. The results were then compared with simulations and a couple closed form expressions, both of which were able to give a reasonable accuracy. There was also success in getting good high frequency transformers. 	Even though some good high-Q inductors were fabricated as part of this thesis, there is still further work that can be done. This includes packaging, integration with capacitors, and further optimization...|$|E

25|$|This entire cycle {{takes place}} very rapidly, the {{oscillations}} dying {{out in a}} time of the order of a millisecond. Each spark across the spark gap produces a pulse of damped sinusoidal high voltage at the output terminal of the coil.

The high voltage from the supply transformer that charges the capacitor is a 50 or 60Hz sine wave.
