2500|$|The Triplane also {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for structural weakness because the wings of some aircraft collapsed in steep dives. This defect was attributed {{to the use of}} light gauge bracing wires in the 46 aircraft built by subcontractor Clayton & Shuttleworth.

In 1918, the RAF issued a <b>technical</b> <b>order</b> for the installation of a spanwise compression strut between the inboard cabane struts of surviving Triplanes. One aircraft, serial N5912, was fitted with additional mid-bay flying wires on the upper wing while used as a trainer.|$|E

40|$|A {{training}} need exits for a common, cost-effective {{virtual reality}} simulation platform for aircraft maintenance training. The need {{is driven by}} a lack of concurrency between equipment and simulators, inaccessibility of equipment and simulators for training, high life-cycle and sustainment costs for training simulators, and the absence of full-scale assets or mock-up devices at training squadrons. In the absence of training assets and devices, resident training has been restricted to traditional methods such as referencing <b>technical</b> <b>orders</b> and academic courseware. An additional need for on-demand training at operational units has contributed to increased costs by allowing maintainers to use operational flight simulators that often require declassification for maintenance training purposes.
