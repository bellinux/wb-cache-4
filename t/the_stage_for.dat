5|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in September 1970 but again failed to achieve significant success.

5|$|After {{a success}} as Hamlet in London in 1925, Barrymore left <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> 14 years and instead focused entirely on films. In the silent film era, {{he was well}} {{received}} in such pictures as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920), Sherlock Holmes (1922) and The Sea Beast (1926). During this period, he gained his nickname, the Great Profile. His stage-trained voice proved an asset when sound films were introduced, and three of his works, Grand Hotel (1932), Twentieth Century (1934) and Midnight (1939) have been inducted into the National Film Registry.|$|E
5|$|As President, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Congress and his cabinet, even as partisan tensions threatened {{to divide the}} Union. Debate over the status of slavery in the Mexican Cession dominated the political agenda and led to threats of secession from Southerners. Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself, Taylor did not push {{for the expansion of}} slavery, and he sought sectional harmony above all other concerns. To avoid the issue of slavery, he urged settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood, setting <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> the Compromise of 1850.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{appointed}} {{a group of}} insurance experts to study the state's policies and put them out for bid, ultimately saving $2 million.

He opened communications and contacts with Japan, setting <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> future economic relations between that country and Kentucky. Among his other accomplishments as governor were the implementation of competitive bidding for government contracts and passage of a weight-distance tax on trucks.|$|E

5|$|By 1931, many Duval County {{residents}} were warming {{to the idea}} of merging municipal and county governments to reduce bureaucracy, corruption and weak management. As a result, in 1932, citizens of both cities voted for the annexation of South Jacksonville into Jacksonville. While full city-county consolidation was voted down, the efforts of the 1930s set <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> further attempts, ultimately resulting in the 1968 Jacksonville Consolidation.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, {{a number}} of {{alternative}} bands began to sign to major labels.

Some bands such as Pixies had massive success overseas while they were ignored domestically.|$|E
5|$|Doge Domenico Contarini (10431071) had a {{relatively}} uneventful reign, healing the rift between the Doge and his subjects and regaining territory {{that had been}} lost in the east to the Kingdom of Croatia in the years following the deposition of Otto Orseolo. However, one fact remained: based on their actions {{in the first half of}} the 11th century, the majority of the people of Venice were clearly not in favor of having a royal hereditary class.

5|$|Following World War II, Coquitlam and {{the rest}} of the Lower Mainland {{experienced}} substantial population growth that continues today. The opening of Lougheed Highway in 1953 made the city more accessible and set <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> residential growth. In 1971, Coquitlam and Fraser Mills were amalgamated, which gave the city a larger industrial base. The mill closed in 2001, and is now rezoned into a residential area.|$|E
