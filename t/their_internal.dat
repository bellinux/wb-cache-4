5|$|A 1996 {{molecular}} {{analysis of}} 38 Suillus species used the sequences of <b>their</b> <b>internal</b> transcribed spacers to infer phylogenetic relationships and clarify the taxonomy of the genus. The {{results indicate that}} S.spraguei is most closely related to S.decipiens. The species S.granulatus and S.placidus lie on a branch sister to that containing S.spraguei. These results were corroborated and extended in later publications that assessed the relationships between Asian and eastern North American isolates of various Suillus, including S.spraguei. The analysis supported the hypothesis that Chinese and U.S. S.spraguei and S.decipiens were each other's closest relatives, and the clade that contained them could be divided into four distinct subgroups: S.decipiens, U.S. S.spraguei, China (Yunnan) S.spraguei, and China (Jilin) S.spraguei.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} programming, object orgy is a term, {{common in}} the Perl programming community, describing a common failure (or anti-pattern) in object-oriented design or object-oriented programming.

They were mutually hostile; the Xiu Maya of Mani allied themselves with the Spanish, while the Cocom Maya of Sotuta became the implacable enemies of the European colonisers.|$|E
5|$|In the {{eukaryotic}} cell, the cytosol {{is within}} the cell membrane and {{is part of the}} cytoplasm, which also comprises the mitochondria, plastids, and other organelles (but not <b>their</b> <b>internal</b> fluids and structures); the cell nucleus is separate. The cytosol is thus a liquid matrix around the organelles. In prokaryotes, most of the chemical reactions of metabolism take place in the cytosol, while a few take place in membranes or in the periplasmic space. In eukaryotes, while many metabolic pathways still occur in the cytosol, others are contained within organelles.|$|E
5|$|Starting 260million years ago, the yellowish-gray {{limestone}} of the fossil-rich Kaibab Limestone {{was laid}} {{down as a}} limy ooze in a tropical climate.

5|$|The {{biology of}} life {{operates}} {{within a certain}} range of temperatures. Heat {{is a form of}} energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and primary production. Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of solar radiation. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of temperature greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of biodiversity and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. Poikilotherms, for example, have a body temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment. In contrast, homeotherms regulate <b>their</b> <b>internal</b> body temperature by expending metabolic energy.|$|E
5|$|The book's eight {{chapters}} address prominent themes affecting slave children, including education, leisure, religion, {{transitions to}} freedmen, and work expectations. Due {{to a lack}} of historical sources direct from children, the book focuses more on their socialization and stories of survival than <b>their</b> <b>internal</b> perspectives. King's evidence includes slave narratives, ex-slave interviews collected by the Works Progress Administration (WPA), plantation owner diaries, census records, newspapers, autobiographies, missionary reports, and Freedmen's Bureau records. She contrasts Northern and Southern slave life, as well as their ownership by whites, blacks, and Native Americans.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of skyscrapers {{was made possible}} by technological improvements {{during the middle of the}} 19th century. One of these developments was the iron framed building. Masonry buildings supported <b>their</b> <b>internal</b> floors through their walls, but the taller the building, the thicker the walls had to become, particularly at the base. In the 1860s, French engineers experimented with using built-up plate girders made of wrought iron to construct buildings supported by internal metal frames. These frames were stronger than traditional masonry and permitted much thinner walls. The methodology was extensively described in engineering journals and was initially used to build warehouses.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of Indian {{independence}} in 1947, India was divided into two sets of territories, one under direct British rule, and the other under the suzerainty of the British Crown, with control over <b>their</b> <b>internal</b> affairs remaining {{in the hands of}} their hereditary rulers. In addition, there were several colonial enclaves controlled by France and Portugal. The political integration of these territories into India was a declared objective of the Indian National Congress, and the Government of India pursued this over the next decade. Through a combination of factors, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and V. P. Menon convinced the rulers of the various princely states to accede to India. Having secured their accession, they then proceeded, in a step-by-step process, to secure and extend the central government's authority over these states and transform their administrations until, by 1956, there was little difference between the territories that had been part of British India and those that had been part of princely states. Simultaneously, the Government of India, through a combination of diplomatic and military means, acquired de facto and de jure control over the remaining colonial enclaves, which too were integrated into India.|$|E
5|$|Care must {{be taken}} with medications, as side effects may be more common and harder to {{evaluate}} in individuals with AS, and tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and {{an increased risk of}} type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in school-age children have ramifications for classroom learning. Individuals with AS may be unable to identify and communicate <b>their</b> <b>internal</b> moods and emotions or to tolerate side effects that for most people would not be problematic.|$|E
5|$|Each legion was {{normally}} {{partnered with}} an approximately {{equal number of}} allied (non-Roman) auxiliae troops. The addition of allied troops to the Roman army was a formalisation of the earlier arrangement of using light troops from the Socii and Latini, who had received Roman citizenship after the Social War. Auxiliary troops could be formed from either auxiliary light cavalry known as alae, auxiliary light infantry known as cohors auxiliae, or a flexible mixture of the two known as cohors equitata. Cavalry types included mounted archers (Latin: sagittarii) and heavy shock cavalry (Latin: cataphracti or clibanarii). Infantry could be armed with bows, slings, throwing spears, long swords, or thrusting spears. Auxiliary units were originally led by their own chiefs, and, in this period, <b>their</b> <b>internal</b> organisation was left to their commanders.|$|E
