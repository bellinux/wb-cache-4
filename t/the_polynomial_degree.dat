50|$|Some FEM sites {{describe}} hp-adaptivity as {{a combination}} of h-adaptivity (splitting elements in space while keeping their <b>polynomial</b> <b>degree</b> fixed) and p-adaptivity (only increasing their <b>polynomial</b> <b>degree).</b> This is not entirely accurate. The hp-adaptivity is significantly different from both h- and p-adaptivity since the hp-refinement of an element {{can be done in}} many different ways. Besides a p-refinement, the element can be subdivided in space (as in h-adaptivity), but there are many combinations for <b>the</b> <b>polynomial</b> <b>degrees</b> on <b>the</b> subelements. This is illustrated in the figure on the right. For example, if a triangular or quadrilateral element is subdivided into four subelements where <b>the</b> <b>polynomial</b> <b>degrees</b> are allowed to vary by at most two, then this yields 3^4 = 81 refinement candidates (not considering polynomially anisotropic candidates).

Clearly, standard FEM error estimates providing one constant number per element are not enough to guide automatic hp-adaptivity.|$|R
