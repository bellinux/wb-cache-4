5|$|In 1871, the German surgeon Friedrich Trendelenburg (1844–1924) {{published}} a paper describing {{the first successful}} elective human <b>tracheotomy</b> to be performed {{for the purpose of}} administration of general anesthesia. In 1888, Sir Morell Mackenzie (1837–1892) {{published a}} book discussing the indications for <b>tracheotomy.</b> In the early 20th century, <b>tracheotomy</b> became a life-saving treatment for patients afflicted with paralytic poliomyelitis who required mechanical ventilation. In 1909, Philadelphia laryngologist Chevalier Jackson (1865–1958) described a technique for <b>tracheotomy</b> that is used to this day.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, <b>tracheotomy</b> was {{considered}} the only reliable method for intubation of the trachea. However, because {{only a minority of}} patients survived the operation, physicians undertook <b>tracheotomy</b> only as a last resort, on patients who were nearly dead. It was not until the late 19th century however that advances in understanding of anatomy and physiology, as well an appreciation of the germ theory of disease, had improved the outcome of this operation {{to the point that it}} could be considered an acceptable treatment option. Also at that time, advances in endoscopic instrumentation had improved to such a degree that direct laryngoscopy had become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route. By the mid-20th century, the <b>tracheotomy</b> as well as endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation had evolved from rarely employed procedures to becoming essential components of the practices of anesthesiology, critical care medicine, emergency medicine, and laryngology.|$|E
5|$|The first {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} tracheal intubation and subsequent artificial respiration of animals were from Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) of Brussels. In his landmark book published in 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, he described an experiment in which he passed a reed into the trachea of a dying animal whose thorax had been opened and maintained ventilation by blowing into the reed intermittently. Antonio Musa Brassavola (1490–1554) of Ferrara successfully treated a patient suffering from peritonsillar abscess by <b>tracheotomy.</b> Brassavola published his account in 1546; this operation {{has been identified as}} the first recorded successful <b>tracheotomy,</b> despite the many previous references to this operation. Towards the end of the 16th century, Hieronymus Fabricius (1533–1619) described a useful technique for <b>tracheotomy</b> in his writings, although he had never actually performed the operation himself. Fabricius was the first to introduce the idea of a tracheostomy tube. In 1620 the French surgeon Nicholas Habicot (1550–1624) published a report of four successful tracheotomies. In 1714, anatomist Georg Detharding (1671–1747) of the University of Rostock performed a <b>tracheotomy</b> on a drowning victim.|$|E
50|$|Although {{considered}} a good teacher, {{he was not}} known for his writings. He {{was one of the}} first surgeons in Germany to perform <b>tracheotomies</b> for treatment of croup (1848 at Greifswald, five cases). He is also credited for providing an early mention of human pulmonary aspergillosis.|$|R
30|$|We {{investigated}} patient characteristics, symptoms, polyp size, treatments, and {{recurrence of}} 13 hFVP cases. Regurgitation of a mass, dyspnea, and dysphagia were frequently reported symptoms at presentation. All patients were treated by surgical excision with no recurrence. Airway management is critical and <b>tracheotomies</b> were needed in some cases.|$|R
5000|$|Patients whose <b>tracheotomies</b> {{are placed}} beneath the third {{tracheal}} ring cartilage and patients with innominate arteries crossing {{higher on the}} trachea have {{an increased risk of}} developing an TIF. [...] Other factors contributing to the development of TIF include steroids, which weaken the endotracheal mucosa, episodes of hypotension in which the pressure in the tracheostomy tube exceeds that of the endotracheal mucosa, and radiation therapy.|$|R
5|$|The {{girl who}} {{allegedly}} underwent a <b>tracheotomy</b> {{appeared to be}} able to speak and sing clearly mere days after the surgery.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tracheotomy</b> {{consists}} {{of making an}} incision {{on the front of}} the neck and opening a direct airway through an incision in the trachea. The resulting opening can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a tracheostomy tube to be inserted; this tube allows a person to breathe without the use of his nose or mouth. The opening may be made by a scalpel or a needle (referred to as surgical and percutaneous techniques respectively) and both techniques are widely used in current practice. In order to limit the risk of damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves (the nerves that control the voicebox), the <b>tracheotomy</b> is performed as high in the trachea as possible. If only one of these nerves is damaged, the patient's voice may be impaired (dysphonia); if both of the nerves are damaged, the patient will be unable to speak (aphonia). In the acute setting, indications for <b>tracheotomy</b> are similar to those for cricothyrotomy. In the chronic setting, indications for <b>tracheotomy</b> include the need for long-term mechanical ventilation and removal of tracheal secretions (e.g., comatose patients, or extensive surgery involving the head and neck).|$|E
5|$|Dick {{recognized}} that the bloodletting and other treatments were failing, and he proposed performing an emergency <b>tracheotomy</b> as a last-ditch effort to save Washington's life. Few American doctors were then familiar with this procedure {{and the other two}} doctors disapproved.|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} 64 -year-old man who {{suffered}} from recurrent visible swelling attacks {{since the age of}} 20 as well as episodes with severe upper airway edema, resulting in 4 emergency <b>tracheotomies.</b> Eventually after 44 years he was diagnosed with hereditary angioedema (HAE) type II. The aims of this report is to emphasize the importance of awareness concerning HAE, which does not respond to traditional anti-allergic therapy, and remind physicians to test for functional C 1 -INH deficiency...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tracheotomies</b> are {{the most}} {{frequent}} surgical procedures performed {{in the intensive care}} unit. We present a case of major hemorrhage that occurred {{in the intensive care unit}} during an elective percutaneous dilational tracheostomy in a 46 -year-old female diagnosed with multiple myeloma. The patient was later taken to the operation theatre and procedure-related cause of bleeding was ruled out. It was subsequently realized that the cause of bleeding was intrapulmonary and occurred coincidently with the tracheostomy...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. This paper reviews {{analyses}} for tracheostomy within our patient population {{over the last}} 6 years. Methods. We conducted a retrospective chart review of consecutive patients undergoing tracheostomy at the tertiary Dicle University Medical hospital, Turkey, from January 2006 to December 2012. Patient age, sex, emergency, planned tracheostomy, indications, complications, and decannulation time were all assessed. Results. Fifty-six (34 male, 22 female) adult Pediatric patients undergoing tracheostomy between 2006 and 2013 were investigated. The most common indication for tracheostomy was upper airway obstruction (66. 7 %), followed by prolonged intubation (33. 3 %). Mean decannulation times after tracheostomy ranged between 1 and 131 days, the difference being statistically significant (P= 0. 040). There {{was no significant difference}} in terms of mean age (9. 8 ± 6. 0; P= 0. 26). There was also no statistical difference between emergency and planned <b>tracheotomies</b> (P= 0. 606). Conclusion. In our patient population, there was a significant decline in the number of <b>tracheotomies</b> performed for prolonged intubation and an increasing number of patient tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction. According to the literature, permanent decannulation rates were slightly higher with an increase in genetic diseases such as neuromuscular disease...|$|R
5|$|Certain medical {{procedures}} can also injure the airways; these include tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, and <b>tracheotomy.</b> The {{back of the}} trachea may be damaged during <b>tracheotomy.</b> TBI resulting from tracheal intubation (insertion of a tube into the trachea) is rare, and the mechanism by which it occurs is unclear. However, one likely mechanism involves an endotracheal tube catching in a fold of membrane and tearing it as it is advanced downward through the airway. When an endotracheal tube tears the trachea, it typically does so at the posterior (back) membranous wall. Unlike TBI that results from blunt trauma, most iatrogenic injuries to the airway involve longitudinal tears {{to the back of}} the trachea or tears on the side that pull the membranous part of the trachea away from the cartilage. Excessive pressure from the cuff of an endotracheal tube can reduce blood supply to the tissues of the trachea, leading to ischemia and potentially causing it to become ulcerated, infected, and, later, narrowed.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{may also}} be severe and {{long-lasting}} or permanent, such as vocal cord damage, esophageal perforation and retropharyngeal abscess, bronchial intubation, or nerve injury. They may even be immediately life-threatening, such as laryngospasm and negative pressure pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), aspiration, unrecognized esophageal intubation, or accidental disconnection or dislodgement of the tracheal tube. Potentially fatal complications more often associated with prolonged intubation and/or <b>tracheotomy</b> include abnormal communication between the trachea and nearby structures such as the innominate artery (tracheoinnominate fistula) or esophagus (tracheoesophageal fistula). Other significant complications include airway obstruction due to loss of tracheal rigidity, ventilator-associated pneumonia and narrowing of the glottis or trachea. The cuff pressure is monitored carefully {{in order to avoid}} complications from over-inflation, many of which can be traced to excessive cuff pressure restricting the blood supply to the tracheal mucosa. A 2000 Spanish study of bedside percutaneous <b>tracheotomy</b> reported overall complication rates of 10–15% and procedural mortality of 0%, which is comparable to those of other series reported in the literature from the Netherlands and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Vehicle {{occupants}} {{who wear}} seat belts {{have a lower}} incidence of TBI after a motor vehicle accident. However, if the strap is situated {{across the front of}} the neck (instead of the chest), this increases the risk of tracheal injury. Design of medical instruments can be modified to prevent iatrogenic TBI, and medical practitioners can use techniques that reduce the risk of injury with procedures such as <b>tracheotomy.</b>|$|E
40|$|Between 1984 and 1993 we {{performed}} 2105 laser treatments in 1210 patients: 52 % of treatments were done for malignant pathology, 45 % for benign tracheal stenoses and 3 % {{were in a}} miscellaneous group. The procedure was carried out with a rigid bronchoscope under general anaesthesia. In patients with malignant tumors, {{it is a good}} palliative treatment—safe, well tolerated and with immediate results; it can be repeated as many times as needed with and is well accepted by the patient. In patients without tumors, this method avoids emergency <b>tracheotomies.</b> The long term results are now under evaluation...|$|R
5000|$|To {{prevent an}} TIF, {{intubation}} {{time should be}} limited to less than 2 weeks and proper techniques should be used when performing <b>tracheotomies.</b> The occurrence of an TIF can be reduced by using more flexible and blunt tracheostomy tubes and insuring that the tubes are properly aligned in the patients. Placing the tracheostomy between the second and third tracheal rings can minimize the risk of an TIF. [...] Repetitive head movements, especially, hyperextension of the neck should be avoided as since this movement results in contact between the innominate artery and the underside of the tube.|$|R
40|$|The {{use of the}} matrix-assisted laser {{desorption}} ionization-time {{of flight}} (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) generates rapid microbial identification. We are presenting {{a case of a}} 63 -year-old woman with a medical history of chronic tracheostomy admitted for hypotension and fevers to illustrate the clinical implication of MALDI-TOF MS on bacterial identification. Kerstersia gyiorum was identified from the bronchoalveolar lavage isolate. Kerstersia gyiorum has been isolated from human sputum samples, and may be a previously unrecognized colonizer of the upper respiratory tract. Thus, patients with long-term <b>tracheotomies</b> or who are chronically aspirating may be at risk of lower respiratory infection with this organism. Increased use of MALDI-TOF MS in the clinical setting may increase reporting of this atypical isolate...|$|R
5|$|A cricothyrotomy is an {{incision}} {{made through}} the skin and cricothyroid membrane to establish a patent airway during certain life-threatening situations, such as airway obstruction by a foreign body, angioedema, or massive facial trauma. A cricothyrotomy is nearly always performed {{as a last resort}} in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or contraindicated. Cricothyrotomy is easier and quicker to perform than <b>tracheotomy,</b> does not require manipulation of the cervical spine and is associated with fewer complications.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{individuals}} who have used AAC devices include Stephen Hawking, Roger Ebert Tony Proudfoot, and Pete Frates. Hawking is unable to speak due {{to a combination of}} severe disabilities caused by ALS, and an emergency <b>tracheotomy.</b> He has come {{to be associated with the}} unique voice of his particular synthesis equipment. In the past 20 or so years SGD have gained popularity amongst young children with speech deficiencies, such as autism, Down syndrome, and predicted brain damage due to surgery.|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} used route is orotracheal, in which an endotracheal tube is passed through the mouth and vocal {{apparatus}} into the trachea. In a nasotracheal procedure, an endotracheal tube is passed through the nose and vocal apparatus into the trachea. Other methods of intubation involve surgery and include the cricothyrotomy (used almost exclusively in emergency circumstances) and the <b>tracheotomy,</b> used primarily in situations where a prolonged need for airway support is anticipated.|$|E
50|$|Typical jobs {{might include}} trauma {{transfers}}, burn transfers, Pediatric/Neonatal ICU transfers (with {{or without a}} team), ICU transfers, high risk OB/GYN, Stroke/Neurological transfers, STEMI/NSTEMI (heart attack) transfers, transfers of patients with balloon pumps, impella devices, ventilators, chest tubes, ECMO (with a team), open chest transfers, CVP-Line Monitoring, A-Line Monitoring, etc. Skills include all Advanced Life Support skills and any specialized skills of the Registered Nurse. For example: cardiac monitoring, intubation, sedation, paralysis, pain management, rapid sequence induction, needle chest decompression, chest tubes, needle <b>tracheotomies,</b> intraosseous vascular access, intravenous infusions including blood products and vasopressors, etc. These procedures may be performed under standing orders though an Emergency Medicine physician is available 24/7/365 should additional orders or assistance be needed.|$|R
5|$|During that era, {{hospital}} {{nurses and}} midwives were {{trained on the}} job. Schwester Selma trained and supervised all the nurses, operating-room nurses, and midwives in the hospital, teaching the former {{how to make a}} hospital bed and the latter how to diaper newborns and swaddle infants. Sometimes she also substituted for the midwives, who did not live on the premises. For many years, Schwester Selma was Dr. Wallach's right-hand assistant in the areas of uterine curettages, <b>tracheotomies,</b> and ritual circumcisions, accompanied him on house calls, and stood in for him as hospital director when he was away. From 1916 to 1930 she was also in charge of supplies and building maintenance, and making sure the kashrut in the kitchen met Dr. Wallach's strict standards.|$|R
5000|$|In his youth, Wallach {{attended}} the [...] and a Jewish school {{run by the}} Cologne Orthodox community. He studied medicine at the University of Berlin and University of Würzburg, and received his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1889. In 1890 he was chosen by the Frankfurt-based Jewish Conference for the Support of the Jews in Palestine to emigrate to Palestine and carry out its {{plans to open a}} modern Jewish hospital in Jerusalem. Wallach first opened a clinic and pharmacy in the Armenian Quarter of the Old City. He also worked in the Bikur Holim Hospital as a women's and children's physician, ophthalmologist, and surgeon specializing in neck surgery. He was the first to perform <b>tracheotomies</b> in Jerusalem, and performed many ritual circumcisions.|$|R
5|$|When {{taking the}} patient's medical history, {{the subject is}} {{questioned}} about any significant signs or symptoms, such as difficulty in speaking or difficulty in breathing. These may suggest obstructing lesions in various locations within the upper airway, larynx, or tracheobronchial tree. A history of previous surgery (e.g., previous cervical fusion), injury, radiation therapy, or tumors involving the head, neck and upper chest can also provide clues to a potentially difficult intubation. Previous experiences with tracheal intubation, especially difficult intubation, intubation for prolonged duration (e.g., intensive care unit) or prior <b>tracheotomy</b> are also noted.|$|E
5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} far end of the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or a mechanical ventilator. Once there is no longer a need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of the airway, the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a <b>tracheotomy).</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1854, a Spanish singing teacher named Manuel García (1805–1906) {{became the}} first man to view the {{functioning}} glottis in a living human. In 1858, French pediatrician Eugène Bouchut (1818–1891) developed a new technique for non-surgical orotracheal intubation to bypass laryngeal obstruction resulting from a diphtheria-related pseudomembrane. In 1880, Scottish surgeon William Macewen (1848–1924) reported on his use of orotracheal intubation as an alternative to <b>tracheotomy</b> to allow a patient with glottic edema to breathe, {{as well as in the}} setting of general anesthesia with chloroform. In 1895, Alfred Kirstein (1863–1922) of Berlin first described direct visualization of the vocal cords, using an esophagoscope he had modified for this purpose; he called this device an autoscope.|$|E
40|$|The Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) {{movement}} endorses {{a hierarchy}} of evidence that places randomized controlled trials at the top. More specifically, double-blind, placebo- controlled trials are often {{considered to be the}} 'best of the best'. This view leads to the paradox that treatments that seem to be most strongly supported by evidence, ranging from <b>tracheotomies</b> to rabies vaccines, have never been tested in randomized trials of any description and are hence supported by (allegedly) sub-optimal evidence. Moreover many of these treatments do not seem supportable by best evidence - how, for example do we keep the surgeons who perform <b>tracheotomies</b> 'blind'. After a brief introduction (chapter 1), and review of the literature (chapter 2), I argue that criticisms of the EBM hierarchy can be launched from the simple basis that best evidence rules out the most plausible rival hypothesis (chapter 3). To examine the relative evidential weight of placebo controlled trials compared to 'active' controlled trials (in which the control treatment is an existing established treatment) requires a good deal of conceptual work. I defend a modified version of Grunbaum's (1981 / 1986) definition of placebos (chapter 4), then provide constraints on what can count as a 'legitimate' placebo control (chapter 5). Next, I explain why double-blinding does not always rule out additional rival hypotheses. I then argue that the arguments for the superiority of placebo controls are flawed. The 'assay sensitivity' argument is limited in scope and based on a misconception about the nature of placebo controls (chapter 7), while the claim that only placebo controlled trials measure the absolute effect size relies on the questionable assumption that placebo and non-placebo effects add rather than interact (chapter 8). I conclude that the evidence hierarchy endorsed by EBM does not stand on solid foundations...|$|R
40|$|Current {{practice}} {{standards for}} the treatment of early to moderately advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer demand both achievement of cure and preservation of laryngeal structure and function to the greatest extent possible. The oncologic and functional results of transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) for early glottic cancer appear to be comparable to those of radiotherapy, with a higher rate of laryngeal preservation and a lower cost. TLM for early and moderately advanced supraglottic and hypopharyngeal cancers offers similar results with regard to survival and local control to those obtained with open surgical approaches. In addition, functional results of TLM are superior to those of open approaches because <b>tracheotomies</b> are usually avoided, rehabilitation of swallowing is faster, and hospital stay is shorter. TLM, when applicable, has become the preferred modality for surgical treatment of most early to moderately advanced cancers of the larynx and selected tumors of the hypopharynx...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{efficacy}} of primary surgical treatment in the management of locally limited oral tongue carcinoma. Methods. A retrospective evaluation was carried out for all patients treated with primary surgery for pT 1 -pT 2 oral tongue carcinomas at a tertiary referral center between 1980 and 2005. All cases were assessed for disease-specific survival and local control rates in relation to T classification, N classification, infiltration depth of the primary tumor, and decision making on neck management and adjuvant therapy. The cases were additionally evaluated for the incidence of major complications and <b>tracheotomies.</b> Results. 263 cases were assessed. The 5 -year disease-specific survival rate was 75. 2 %. Positive neck disease was shown to be a significant negative prognostic factor. The occult metastasis rate was 20. 2 %. Conclusions. Primary surgical treatment is a very effective modality against T 1 -T 2 oral tongue carcinoma, and a low rate of complications can be anticipated...|$|R
5|$|In the 1920s, Negus {{worked on}} aspects of both throat surgery and {{the anatomy of}} the larynx, the latter work {{contributing}} to his degree of Master of Surgery (1924). His surgical innovations included designs for laryngoscopes, bronchoscopes, oesophagoscopes, an operating table, and <b>tracheotomy</b> equipment. His major publications were The Mechanism of the Larynx (1929) and {{his work on the}} clinical text Diseases of the Nose and Throat, starting with the fourth edition of 1937. Negus was also awarded several lectureships and published many medical papers and other works on comparative anatomy and laryngology. He became a senior surgeon at King's College Hospital in 1940 and a consulting surgeon in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of TBI varies {{based on}} the {{location}} and severity of injury and whether the patient is stable or having trouble breathing, but ensuring that the airway is patent so that the patient can breathe is always of paramount importance. Ensuring an open airway and adequate ventilation may be difficult in people with TBI. Intubation, one method to secure the airway, {{may be used to}} bypass a disruption in the airway in order to send air to the lungs. If necessary, a tube can be placed into the uninjured bronchus, and a single lung can be ventilated. If there is a penetrating injury to the neck through which air is escaping, the trachea may be intubated through the wound. Multiple unsuccessful attempts at conventional (direct) laryngoscopy may threaten the airway, so alternative techniques to visualize the airway, such as fiberoptic or video laryngoscopy, may be employed to facilitate tracheal intubation. If the upper trachea is injured, an incision can be made in the trachea (<b>tracheotomy)</b> or the cricothyroid membrane (cricothyrotomy, or cricothyroidotomy) in order to ensure an open airway. However, cricothyrotomy may not be useful if the trachea is lacerated below the site of the artificial airway. <b>Tracheotomy</b> is used sparingly because it can cause complications such as infections and narrowing of the trachea and larynx. When it is impossible to establish a sufficient airway, or when complicated surgery must be performed, cardiopulmonary bypass may be used—blood is pumped out of the body, oxygenated by a machine, and pumped back in. If a pneumothorax occurs, a chest tube may be inserted into the pleural cavity to remove the air.|$|E
5|$|Adler's throat closes {{up during}} the MRI due to an {{allergic}} reaction to gadolinium, prompting two members of House's team, Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), to perform a <b>tracheotomy.</b> Working in the hospital's clinic, House's first patient {{is a man who}} is orange because of an over-consumption of carrots and mega-dose vitamins (niacin). House also treats a ten-year-old boy whose mother allows him to use his asthmatic inhaler only intermittently instead of daily as prescribed. House criticises the mother for making such a drastic medical decision without first learning more about asthma. During his monologue, House stumbles on an idea and leaves quickly to treat Adler; he diagnoses her with cerebral vasculitis, despite having no proof. House treats Adler with steroids, which improves her condition greatly for a time, until she starts seizing and has heart failure. The team brings her back with a defibrillator.|$|E

30|$|The {{outcome of}} the present study is {{somewhat}} in contrast to the findings reported by Marchese et al. [13], whereby 90 % of patients undergoing invasive HMV would have chosen a tracheostomy again. However, the <b>tracheotomies</b> in the latter study were performed electively, and the patients were younger and had a promising median survival of 49  months. Furthermore, they were cared for primarily by family members, in contrast to our study population, whose primary care was provided by specialized nurses. In addition, the proportion of patients with pulmonary diseases was considerably lower in the Marchese study than the present one [13]. Of note, HRQL and life satisfaction in the present trial were particularly impaired in patients with COPD, in line with the previous observations [9]. Finally, patients in the current study had significant co-morbidities.

40|$|SummaryRobots have invaded {{industry}} and, more recently, {{the field}} of medicine. Following the development of various prototypes, Intuitive Surgical® has developed the Da Vinci surgical robot. This robot, designed for abdominal surgery, has been widely used in urology since 2000. The many advantages of this transoral robotic surgery (TORS) are described in this article. Its disadvantages are essentially its high cost {{and the absence of}} tactile feedback. The first feasibility studies in head and neck cancer, conducted in animals, dummies and cadavres, were performed in 2005, followed by the first publications in patients in 2006. The first series including more than 20 patients treated by TORS demonstrated the feasibility for the following sites: oropharynx, supraglottic larynx and hypopharynx. However, these studies did not validate the oncological results of the TORS technique. TORS decreases the number of <b>tracheotomies,</b> and allows more rapid swallowing rehabilitation and a shorter length of hospital stay. Technical improvements are expected. Smaller, more ergonomic, new generation robots, therefore more adapted to the head and neck, will probably be available in the future...|$|R
