5|$|As CAS, Williams had {{to contend}} with serious {{challenges}} to the RAAF's continued existence from <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>and</b> Navy in 1929 and 1932, arising from the competing demands for defence funding during the Great Depression. According to Williams, only after 1932 was the independence of the Air Force assured. Williams again handed over the reins of CAS to Goble in 1933 to attend the Imperial Defence College in London, resuming his position in June 1934. His promotion to air vice marshal on 1January 1935 belatedly raised him to the equivalent rank of his fellow Chiefs of Staff in <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>and</b> Navy.
