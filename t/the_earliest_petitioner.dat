He served 16 years in Robben Island in the same section as Nelson Mandela, to whom he was a personal friend. He was released in 1984 and rejoined SWAPO as Secretary General in exile in Lusaka, Zambia.

50|$|A {{petition}} for a writ of coram nobis must provide valid {{reasons for not}} attacking <b>the</b> conviction <b>earlier.</b> <b>Petitioners</b> need to show “reasonable diligence”, where legitimate justifications exist for not raising challenges to their convictions sooner or through more usual channels (such as a § 2255 petition while in custody.) A delay may be considered reasonable when the applicable law was recently changed and made retroactive, when new evidence was discovered that the petitioner could not reasonably have located <b>earlier,</b> or when <b>the</b> <b>petitioner</b> was improperly advised by counsel not to pursue habeas relief.|$|R
50|$|West Virginia {{state courts}} may issue the writ of coram nobis to correct either errors of fact or errors of law. The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia {{provided}} the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in West Virginia (Citations and quotes removed):The writ of coram nobis is only granted as a remedy {{of last resort}} where an error is {{of the most fundamental}} character and there exists no other available remedy. The writ is narrowly limited to extraordinary cases presenting circumstances compelling its use to achieve justice.In West Virginia, the common law writ of coram nobis was abolished in civil cases in 1960 pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure. No provision equivalent to the relief mechanism of Rule 60(b) exists in the West Virginia Rules of Criminal Procedure.West Virginia courts are authorized to issue the writ in criminal proceeding using criteria similar to the criteria established by the US Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal. The criteria established a four-part test. A petitioner seeking this relief must show that::# A more usual remedy is not available. In other words, a petition for a writ of coram nobis may only be filed after a sentence has been served and the petitioner is no longer in custody. :# Valid reasons exist for not attacking <b>the</b> conviction <b>earlier.</b> <b>Petitioners</b> need to show reasonable diligence, where legitimate justifications exist for not raising challenges to their convictions sooner or through more usual channels.:# Adverse consequences exist from the conviction; however, West Virginia courts have not yet established what constitutes “adverse consequences.”:# The error is of the most fundamental character. The error to be corrected must be an error which resulted in a complete miscarriage of justice. In other words, the error is one that has rendered the proceeding itself irregular and invalid.|$|R

25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> {{petitions}} {{on record}} dates to 1644. A group of eleven petitioners, not including their children, entreated the Council of New Netherland for freedom, {{based on the}} claim {{that it was impossible}} for them to support their growing families under slavery. The Dutch West India Company released these slaves on a plan of half-freedom; this allowed slaves their liberty in exchange for payment of an annual tributary to <b>the</b> company. During <b>early</b> America and <b>the</b> first two decades of the colonial period, slavery had not become a racial caste within the area of Dutch authority. The Dutch West India Company freed many slaves between 1644 and 1664, when they lost control of their colony to England. These <b>early</b> <b>petitioners</b> did not base their claim for freedom on ethnicity but on the monetary realities of living in slavery and caring for a family. This line of argument quickly faded from the records.|$|R
