Æthelthryth, accompanied by her minister Owine, travelled from Ely to Northumbria when she married for the second time, to Ecgfrith.|$|E

It was witnessed by the archbishop's crossbearer, three of Theobald's nephews and the clerk who presumably {{was in charge}} of them, a chancellor, two chaplains who were monks, a butler, dispenser, chamberlain, steward, cook, usher, porter and marshal. Theobald also {{at about the same time}} granted a mill to his baker named William and some lands to his cook William and the cook's heirs.|$|E
5|$|Firefighters {{were able}} to save over 100 {{people out of the}} 180 {{families}} inhabiting the high-rise apartment building. According to Al Jazeera, the fire began at the scaffolding <b>that</b> <b>surrounded</b> the building, but spread to the complex's main building of around 500 apartments. Xinhua News Agency said the fire was contained at about 6:30pm local time (10:30 UTC), more than four hours after it began.|$|E
5|$|Like all of Uranus' moons, Ariel {{probably}} {{formed from}} an accretion disc <b>that</b> <b>surrounded</b> the planet shortly after its formation, and, like other large moons, {{it is likely}} differentiated, with an inner core of rock surrounded by a mantle of ice. Ariel has a complex surface consisting of extensive cratered terrain cross-cut by a system of scarps, canyons, and ridges. The surface shows signs of more recent geological activity than other Uranian moons, most likely due to tidal heating.|$|E

5|$|London and the Thames {{were named}} in 1793 by John Graves Simcoe, who {{proposed}} {{the site for}} the capital of Upper Canada. The first European settlement was between 1801 and 1804 by Peter Hagerman. The village was founded in 1826 and incorporated in 1855. Since then, London has grown to be the largest Southwestern Ontario municipality and Canada's 11th largest metropolitan area, having annexed many of the smaller communities <b>that</b> <b>surrounded</b> it.|$|E
5|$|Sir John William Dawson, McGill's {{principal}} from 1855 to 1893, {{is often}} credited with transforming the school {{into a modern}} university. He recruited the aid of Montreal's wealthiest citizens (eighty percent of Canada's wealth was then controlled by families who lived within the Golden Square Mile area <b>that</b> <b>surrounded</b> the university), many of whom donated property and funding needed to construct the campus buildings. Their names adorn many of the campus's prominent buildings.|$|E
5|$|The wall {{surrounding}} the temple was formerly {{part of a}} city wall <b>that</b> <b>surrounded</b> Quyang. The south gate of the temple once served {{as one of the}} main gates for the town.

The temple grounds are also home to over 137 stelae, dating from the Northern Wei Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty.|$|E

In general the name describes something <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> the personality, its {{external and internal}} world, as well as feelings. So, the Sanskrit: Atmasfera is the etymological root of the English word: atmosphere.|$|R

The most successful Big Brother housemate worldwide, Goody died of cervical cancer two months before the programme aired. The programme was watched by 305,000 people; 1.8% of the TV audience.|$|E
5|$|As with Parcells {{eight years}} previous, one of Handley's first major {{decisions}} involved replacing Phil Simms as starting quarterback. Jeff Hostetler {{was named the}} team's starter. Though the Giants won their opening game in an NFC Championship Game rematch against the 49ers, 16–14, they lost three out of their next four games to drop to 2–3. Though they rallied to finish the season 8–8, and Simms reclaimed his starting job later in the year, the excitement <b>that</b> <b>surrounded</b> the Giants the previous year was gone. One of the few promising young players to emerge on the team was second–year running back Rodney Hampton, who led the Giants in rushing with 1,059 yards.|$|E
5|$|Because the 1924 Rose Bowl {{and several}} later Rose Bowls had very high ticket sales, the Tournament of Roses Association decided to close off the {{southern}} end of the Rose Bowl stadium and expand the seating from a horseshoe design to one <b>that</b> <b>surrounded</b> the entire field. The 1924 game was the first in which the Tournament of Roses made participating schools responsible for ticket sales. The strategy has been used since, with only a small number of tickets allocated to Tournament officials for each yearly edition.|$|E

5|$|Before the 1760s, Westgate {{consisted}} {{of only a}} farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew <b>that</b> <b>surrounded</b> it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited {{its name from the}} Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} October, the New Zealand Division was {{positioned}} {{to the west of}} the fortified town of Le Quesnoy. On 4 November, the next phase of the Allied advance began with the Battle of the Sambre. The division was tasked with the capture of Le Quesnoy and extending the front line past the town. The Rifle Brigade encircled and, through the achievement of its 4th Battalion in scaling the ramparts <b>that</b> <b>surrounded</b> the town, pushed into Le Quesnoy by the close of the day while the 1st Brigade had established a line to the east. This was the division's most successful day on the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|Callisto is {{surrounded}} by an extremely thin atmosphere composed {{of carbon dioxide and}} probably molecular oxygen, as well as by a rather intense ionosphere. Callisto is thought to have formed by slow accretion from the disk of the gas and dust <b>that</b> <b>surrounded</b> Jupiter after its formation. Callisto's gradual accretion and the lack of tidal heating meant that not enough heat was available for rapid differentiation. The slow convection in the interior of Callisto, which commenced soon after formation, led to partial differentiation and possibly to the formation of a subsurface ocean at a depth of 100150km and a small, rocky core.|$|E

5|$|Helena {{was devoted}} to nursing, and took the lead at the {{charitable}} organisations she represented. She was also an active campaigner, and wrote letters to newspapers and magazines promoting the interests of nurse registration. Her royal status helped to promote the publicity and society interest <b>that</b> <b>surrounded</b> organisations such as the Royal British Nurses' Association. The RBNA still survives today with Baroness Cox as president. Emily Williamson founded the Gentlewomen's Employment Association in Manchester; one of the projects which {{came out of this}} group was the Princess Christian Training College for Nurses, in Fallowfield, Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Illingworth's final {{match was}} against Queensland in December 1964. He took 0/34 as Queensland batted first and made 270. After scoring seven of his team's 341, he took 1/86 as Queensland {{declared}} at 5/332. Chasing 261 for victory, Illingworth made four as his team lost by 40 runs. Illingworth ended {{his career with}} 15 wickets {{at an average of}} 27.60, and 155 runs at 17.22. The state selectors were reluctant to pick him for Victoria because of the throwing allegations <b>that</b> <b>surrounded</b> him.|$|E

The three stamps were first placed on sale in Washington, D.C. and in five Massachusetts cities and towns that played major roles in the Lexington and Concord story: Lexington, Concord, Boston, Cambridge, and Concord Junction (as West Concord was then known).
