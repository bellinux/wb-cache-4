The PK profile of <b>tulathromycin</b> was also established in pneumonic calves. For Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida, <b>tulathromycin</b> minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were approximately 50 times lower in calf serum than in Mueller-Hinton broth. The breakpoint value of the PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) index (AUC(0 - 24 h) /MIC) to achieve a bactericidal effect was estimated from in vitro time-kill studies to be approximately 24 h for M. haemolytica and P. multocida.

Estimation of <b>tulathromycin</b> {{depletion}} in plasma {{and milk}} after subcutaneous injection in lactating goats using a nonlinear mixed-effects pharmacokinetic modeling approach. Bmc Veterinary Research, 12, 10. doi: 10. 1186 /s 12917 - 016 - 0884 - 4 Background: Extra-label use of <b>tulathromycin</b> in lactating goats is common and may cause violative residues in milk. The {{objective of this}} study was to develop a nonlinear mixed-effects pharmacokinetic (NLME-PK) model to estimate <b>tulathromycin</b> depletion in plasma and milk of lactating goats. Eight lactating goats received two subcutaneous injections of 2. 5 mg/kg <b>tulathromycin</b> 7 days apart; blood and milk samples were analyzed for concentrations of <b>tulathromycin</b> and the common fragment of <b>tulathromycin</b> (i. e., the marker residue CP- 60, 300), respectively, using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Based on these new data and related literature data, a NLME-PK compartmental model with first-order absorption and elimination was used to model plasma concentrations and cumulative excreted amount in milk. Monte Carlo simulations with 100 replicates were performed to predict the time when the upper limit of the 95 % confidence interval of milk concentrations was below the tolerance. Results: All animals were healthy throughout the study with normal appetite and milk production levels, and with mild-moderate injection-site reactions that diminished by the end of the study. The measured data showed that milk concentrations of the marker residue of <b>tulathromycin</b> were below the limit of detection (LOD = 1. 8 ng/ml) 39 days after the second injection. A 2 -compartment model with milk as an excretory compartment best described <b>tulathromycin</b> plasma and CP- 60, 300 milk pharmacokinetic data. The model-predicted data correlated with the measured data very well. The NLME-PK model estimated that <b>tulathromycin</b> plasma concentrations were below LOD (1. 2 ng/ml) 43 days after a single injection, and 62 days after the second injection with a 95 % confidence. These estimated times are much longer than the current meat withdrawal time recommendation of 18 days for <b>tulathromycin</b> in non-lactating cattle. Conclusions: The results suggest that twice subcutaneous injections of 2. 5 mg/kg <b>tulathromycin</b> are a clinically safe extra-label alternative approach for treating pulmonary infections in lactating goats, but a prolonged withdrawal time of at least 39 days after the second injection should be considered to prevent violative residues in milk and any dairy goat being used for meat should have an extended meat withdrawal time...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tulathromycin</b> is a {{macrolide}} antibiotic {{approved for}} use in cattle and swine respiratory disease. Extra-label use of <b>tulathromycin</b> occurs in bison and deer and significant interspecies differences in pharmacokinetics warrant specific investigation in these species. This study involved investigation of the pharmacokinetics of <b>tulathromycin</b> in bison and white-tailed deer following a single 2. 5 mg/kg bw subcutaneous injection (n= 10) of Draxxin (Pfizer Inc.) to provide important information regarding <b>tulathromycin</b> dosage regimens in these species. As well, <b>tulathromycin</b> distribution and depletion in deer muscle and lung tissues following a 2. 5 mg/kg bw subcutaneous injection of Draxxin was investigated to obtain pilot information regarding withdrawal time of <b>tulathromycin</b> in deer. For the pharmacokinetic studies, serial blood samples were collected at baseline and up to 25 days post-injection. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using non-compartmental methods. For the tissue pilot study, deer (n = 2 to 3) were slaughtered at 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8 weeks post-injection. A quantitative analytical liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method for measuring <b>tulathromycin</b> was developed and validated in bison and deer serum and deer lung and muscle according to international guidelines. Samples were processed by solid-phase extraction. Reverse-phase chromatography was performed by gradient elution. Positive electrospray ionization was used to detect the double charged ion [M+ 2 H]+ 2 at m/z 403. 9 and monitored in selected ion monitoring mode. <b>Tulathromycin</b> demonstrated early maximal serum concentrations, extensive distribution, and slow elimination characteristics in deer and bison. In bison, mean Cmax (195 ng/mL) was lower compared to cattle (300 to 500 ng/mL) and half-life (214 hours) longer (cattle, 90 to 110 hours). In deer, mean Cmax (359 ng/mL) is comparable to cattle, but half-life (281 hours) was much longer. Tissue distribution and clinical efficacy studies are needed in bison to confirm extensive distribution of <b>tulathromycin</b> into lung and the appropriate dosage regimen. <b>Tulathromycin</b> was extensively distributed to deer lung and muscle, with tissue levels peaking within 7 to 14 days after injection. Drug tissue concentrations were detected 56 days after treatment, longer than the established withdrawal time of 44 days in cattle. This prolonged drug concentration in the tissue is supportive for the administration of <b>tulathromycin</b> as a single injection therapy for treatment of respiratory disease of deer.

Failure of vaccination to curtail spread of this disease has led to calls for evaluation {{of the role of}} antimicrobials in CBPP control. Three major classes of antimicrobial are effective against mycoplasmas, namely tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and macrolides. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine the effector kinetics of oxytetracycline, danofloxacin and <b>tulathromycin</b> against two MmmSC field strains in artificial medium and adult bovine serum. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined for oxytetracycline, danofloxacin and <b>tulathromycin</b> against MmmSC strains B 237 and Tan 8 using a macrodilution technique, and time-kill curves were constructed for various multiples of the MIC over a 24 hour period in artificial medium and serum. Data were fitted to sigmoid E(max) models to obtain 24 hour-area under curve/MIC ratios for mycoplasmastasis and, where appropriate, for mycoplasmacidal activity and virtual mycoplasmal elimination. RESULTS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations against B 237 were 20 -fold higher, 2 -fold higher and approximately 330 -fold lower in serum than in artificial medium for oxytetracycline, danofloxacin and <b>tulathromycin,</b> respectively. Such differences were mirrored in experiments using Tan 8. Oxytetracycline was mycoplasmastatic against both strains in both matrices. Danofloxacin elicited mycoplasmacidal activity against B 237 and virtual elimination of Tan 8; similar maximum antimycoplasmal effects were observed in artificial medium and serum. <b>Tulathromycin</b> effected virtual elimination of B 237 but was mycoplasmastatic against Tan 8 in artificial medium. However, this drug was mycoplasmastatic against both strains in the more physiologically relevant matrix of serum.

Clonal relationships were assessed using repetitive sequence PCR and descriptive epidemiological analysis was performed. The H. somni isolates appeared to be geographically clonal, with 27 / 53 (47 %) isolates grouping in one cluster from one Australian state. On the basis of disc diffusion, 34 / 53 (64 %) isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested; there was intermediate susceptibility to <b>tulathromycin</b> in 12 isolates, tilmicosin in seven isolates and resistance to tilmicosin in one isolate. Using MIC, all but one isolate was susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested; the non-susceptible isolate was resistant to tetracycline, but this MIC result could not be compared to disc diffusion, {{since there are no}} interpretative guidelines for disc diffusion for H. somni against tetracycline. In this study, there was little evidence of antimicrobial resistance in H. somni isolates from Australian cattle. Disc diffusion susceptibility testing results were comparable to MIC results for most antimicrobial agents tested; however, results for isolates with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to tilmicosin and <b>tulathromycin</b> on disc diffusion should be interpreted with caution in the absence of MIC results.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the anti-inflammatory effects of macrolides through kinetic parameters in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury. Rats were divided into four groups: lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS + tylosin, LPS + tilmicosin and LPS + <b>tulathromycin.</b> BALF samples were collected at sampling times. TNF, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 10 and 13, 14 -dihydro- 15 -keto-prostaglandin F 2 α (PGM) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were analysed. Area under the curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) values of inflammatory mediators were determined by a pharmacokinetic computer programme. When inflammatory mediator concentrations were compared between the LPS group and other groups for each sampling time, the three macrolides had no pronounced depressor effect on cytokine levels, but they depressed PGM and CRP levels. In addition, tylosin and tilmicosin decreased the AUC 0 - 24 level of TNF, while tilmicosin decreased the AUC 0 - 24 level of IL- 10. Tylosin and <b>tulathromycin</b> decreased the AUC 0 - 24 of PGM, and all three macrolides decreased the AUC 0 - 24 of CRP. Especially tylosin and <b>tulathromycin</b> may have more expressed anti-inflammatory effects than tilmicosin, via depressing the production of inflammatory mediators in the lung. The AUC may be used for determining the effects of drugs on inflammation. In this study, the antiinflammatory effects of these antibiotics were evaluated with kinetic parameters as a new and different approach. ...|$|E

BRD is a multifaceted group of pathogens, both viral and bacterial, that take advantage of an immune compromised calf to cause disease. This study took aim at comparing metaphylactic treatments for BRD in both the feedlot and pasture setting. In the feedlot study, heifers (n= 579, 403. 7 ± 27. 4 lbs) from Southwest Texas were identified as being high risk for BRD and shipped to the Clayton Livestock Research Center in Clayton, NM. Cattle were randomly allocated within truck load lots into 18 to 20 head treatment pens (30 pens; 3 treatments; 10 reps). Cattle were given one of three metaphylactic treatments based on the randomly assigned treatment for their pen within a replicate. The three antibiotic treatments administered at initial processing were: 1) <b>Tulathromycin</b> (2. 5 mg/kg), 2) Tilmicosin (13. 3 mg/kg), and 3) Gamithromycin (6. 0 mg/kg). Cattle were fed a typical commercial starter diet for the first 56 - 60 d with a step-up ration change at day 28. At the end of the feeding period, pens were weighed and body weights recorded. Dry Matter Intake, morbidity, and mortality were recorded by CLRC personnel daily. Cattle administered <b>tulathromycin</b> had higher daily gains than cattle administered gamithromycin by 0. 29 lbs/d (P<. 01) and tended (P= 0. 09) have higher daily gains than cattle that received tilmicosin by 0. 18 lbs/d. <b>Tulathromycin</b> treated cattle tended (P = 0. 12) to have improved feed efficiency compared to gamithromycin treated cattle. Cattle that received <b>tulathromycin</b> (5. 2 %) had lower morbidity rates (P <. 02) than tilmicosin (14. 6 %) and gamithromycin (12. 79 %) treated cattle. There were no treatment differences in dry matter intake or mortality in cattle. For the wheat pasture study, heifers (n= 120, 393. 2 ± 28. 6 lbs) from the same origin and risk were shipped to the CLRC and processed before being trailed to a nearby wheat pasture. Cattle were randomly assigned into three treatment groups (3 treatments, 40 reps), and were given one of three metaphylactic treatments. The three antibiotic treatments administered at initial processing were: 1) <b>Tulathromycin</b> (2. 5 mg/kg), 2) Tilmicosin (13. 3 mg/kg), and 3) Gamithromycin (6. 0 mg/kg). Cattle were allowed to graze on wheat for 54 days with free-choice Hi-Pro mineral mixed with Lasalocid, an ionophore. After 54 days on wheat pasture, the cattle were trailed back to the CLRC facilities and final individual weights were recorded. Morbidity and mortality were recorded daily by CLRC personnel.

Generally, P. multocida isolates are susceptible to most of the widely used commercial antimicrobial agents but their excessive and unjustified use accelerates the emergence of resistant strains. We defined the antimicrobial sensitivity pattern of 56 P. multocida strains isolated from poultry (20) and swine [16 P. multocida toxin (PMT) positive and 20 PMT negative] to 16 widely applied antibiotics (apramycin, cefquinome, chloramphenicol, colistin, doxycycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, florfenicol, flumequine, neomycin, oxolinic acid, penicillin, trimethoprim potentiated sulphamethoxazole, sulphonamide compounds, tetracycline, <b>tulathromycin)</b> by the disk diffusion method. The majority of the strains was susceptible to most of the antimicrobial agents tested. However, the resistance to sulphonamides, tetracyclines, first-generation quinolones and aminoglycosides was remarkable, and thus the use of these compounds for the treatment of infection caused by P. multocida is not recommended.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of <b>tulathromycin</b> in the control of respiratory diseases (BRD) in buffalo calves. The trial was performed in one buffalo farm located in the South of Italy where more than 2, 000 animals are bred. An outbreak of BRD was considered when the animals showed three of the following criteria: rectal temperature > 39. 8 °C, depression score > 2 on a scale of 0 (alert) to 4 (soporous), respiratory rate > 60 ⁄ min), dyspnoea (abnormal lung sounds) and cough or nasal discharge. A nasal swab was performed for microbiological investigations. After the results of the latter animals were treated with a standard therapeutic regimen on D 0, which consists of 2. 5 mg/kg/live weight of <b>tulathromycin</b> (Draxxin®, Zoetis SRL, Italy) in a single administration. Daily clinical examinations were performed on treated calves for fourteen consecutive days to evaluate: A) depression score and general health status with a score from 0 (normal) to 4 (general conditions severely impaired); B) respiratory distress with a score from 0 (no alterations) to 3 (respiratory rate > 80 ⁄min, abdominal breath and nasal discharge) and C) rectal temperature with a score from 0 (normal; 38. 8 - 39 °C) to 3 (> 40. 3 °C). Data were analyzed by analysis of variance. A total of 81 calves (53 females and 28 males) were included in the study. Bacteriological cultures revealed the presence of Pasteurella M. and Moraxella spp. in 53. 1 and 38. 3 % of the samples, respectively. The average A, B and C scores were 2. 24 ± 0. 1, 1. 85 ± 0. 1 and 1. 78 ± 0. 1 on day 0. Treatment was effective in solving the BRD in four days (Scores A, B and C = 0) in 79 / 81 calves (97. 5 %), and, consequently, 2 / 81 (2. 5 %) mortality rate was recorded.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Animal Science and IndustryChris ReinhardtDan ThomsonBovine Respiratory Disease Complex (BRDC) is {{the most}} common and costly disease in feedlot cattle in North America. Annual {{economic}} losses are estimated to be US$ 1 billion due to mortality, reduced performance, and treatment costs. The disease is a multifactorial syndrome caused by a combination of environmental factors, management practices, animal susceptibility, and viral and bacterial pathogens. The objectives of this dissertation were to evaluate two injectable antimicrobials for the treatment and control of BRDC in feedlot cattle, investigation of factors associated with BRDC mortality and morbidity, and to develop control charts based on statistical process control (SPC) principles to monitor cattle mortality rates. Two multi-site prospective studies were conducted to evaluate the comparative efficacy of the administration of gamithromycin and <b>tulathromycin</b> for the treatment and control of BRDC. A total of 2, 529 animals were enrolled at two commercial feedlot locations to evaluate the efficacy of the antimicrobials to control BRDC. Morbidity due to BRDC was higher (P = 0. 03) among calves receiving gamithromycin compared with those receiving tulathromycin; however, treatments were considered bioequivalent (P < 0. 05) for BRDC mortality, case fatality rate and re-treatment rate. Final BW, ADG, DMI and F:G, were similar (P< 0. 05) between the groups of calves receiving gamithromycin and <b>tulathromycin.</b> For the evaluation of treatment efficacy, a total of 1, 049 calves were enrolled in the study. Re-treatment rate was higher among animals treated with gamithromycin compared with those treated with <b>tulathromycin.</b> Treatments were bioequivalent (P < 0. 05) for case fatality rate, final BW, and ADG. To evaluate factors associated with BRDC, a retrospective study was conducted to analyze BRDC mortality and morbidity associated with initial body weight, rectal temperature, and castration and dehorning (tipping) at processing. Calves with lighter weights and fever at processing were at greater risk of mortality and morbidity due to BRDC. Also, bulls castrated at processing were at higher risk of developing BRDC. Finally, we developed control charts based on SPC principles to monitor and identify “normal” and special cases of variation of mortality rate. In feedlot cattle, monitoring lots of cattle through SPC principles {{can be used as a}} powerful tool for continuous improvement...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this field}} study was to compare in two APP-problem herds the {{efficiency}} and profitability of a single-dose -injection of <b>Tulathromycin</b> with the usual feed medication of Amoxicillin resp. Tetracycline for metaphylaxis after weaning resp. starting fattening. The clinical trial was conducted from October 2007 to May 2008 in a farrow to wean herd (two series of 686 weaned piglets) and in an independent fattening herd (one series of 603 pigs), both with the repeated occurrence of acute Pleuropneumonia by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP). After weaning resp. herd addition for fattening pigs were separated to different pens or stable rows for alternative metaphylaxis of <b>Tulathromycin</b> by a single i. m. -injection or of Amoxicillin-Trihydrat (weaned piglets) resp. of Tetracycline-HCL (fattening pigs) by oral feed medication of 7 days {{on the basis of}} preceding resistograms. With consideration for the farm owners only every 6 th or 10 th pig served as a non treated control (risk of losses). For space and feeding reasons (oral medications) these controls had to be housed in the same pens as the <b>Tulathromycin</b> medicated pigs. Objectives of this trial were kind and frequency of diseases and losses, growing performance (daily weight gain) and frequency of unsaleable pigs at delivery for fattening resp. slaughtering, as well as costs for drug treatments during the total growing period and for the growing delay. In addition, a sample of 280 weaned pigs was bleeded four times until delivery in order to control associations of C-Reactive-Proteine (CRP) and herd health resp. efficiency of metaphylaxis. Respiratory diseases and losses did not occur during their effective period. Afterwards the incidence of sporadically diseased pigs with different symptoms varied over time between 0 % an 19 % in weaned pigs resp. 1. 5 % and 6 % in fattening pigs without significant group differences. Losses in weaned pigs ranged from 0 to 5. 1 % and in fattening pigs significantly (p< 0. 05) from 1. 2 % resp. 1. 6 % (metaphylactic treatments) and 9. 3 % (untreated controls). At {{the end of the first}} weaner series, in the 7 th week, only the Amoxicillin-group was affected by an acute APP-infection with 93. 5 % of diseased pigs. CRP-serum values of the first weaner series with an acute APP-outbreak differed extremely between groups and dates, particularly between first and follow up dates. Consecutive studies should clarify, if high values, as observed in our study and in contrast to others, are associated with a powerful immunity resp. with an efficient metaphylaxis (Tulathromycingroup), and if low values indicate the onset of the incubation of an infectious disease (Amoxicillin-group). In the first series of weaned pigs daily weight gains were significantly higher in the Tulathromycin-treated group (p< 0, 05) than in the APP-diseased Amoxicillin-group (0, 433 kg vs. 0, 388 kg) but not in the control group. In the second series of weaners and in fattening pigs groups did not differ in the growing performance. Due to the APP-infection in the first series of weaners, the rate of unsaleable pigs at delivery was significantly higher (p< 0, 001) in the Amoxicillin-group (24, 9 %) as compared to the Tulathromycin-group (5, 9 %) and the untreated controls (10, 9 %). Costs for metaphylaxis and additional medications per pig over time (drugs and treatments by stock´s person), and daily costs per unsaleable pigs after delivery were in case of the APP-infection much lower with <b>Tulathromycin</b> than with Amoxicillin as a metaphylaxis. In the second series of weaners and in fattenting pigs, each without APP-infection, oral Amoxicillinresp. Tetracycline-metaphylaxis was less expensive in total than the Tulathromycinmetaphylaxis by single dose injection. This is mainly due to higher drug volumes and working expenditure for the i. m. application. Further studies under field conditions should prove if total costs of Tulathromycin-metaphylaxis in case of extremely exposed APP-fattening herds may adjust or even reverse these costs. The good health and growing performance of non treated controls which were housed commonly with the <b>Tulathromycin</b> treated pigs might be the result of the antimicrobial caused decrease in germ pressure and its consecutive lower risk of infection. With reservation of the specific herd situations in this field study we conclude that in extremely APP-exposed weaned piglets the parenteral metaphylaxis of <b>Tulathromycin</b> with a single i. m. injection might be more efficient and less expensive during the growing period than oral medication of Amoxicillin over 7 days...|$|E

This study investigated the effects of administering macrolides to beef cattle either systemically through a single subcutaneous injection (therapeutic) or continuously in-feed (subtherapeutic), on the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Mannheimia haemolytica and Enterococcus spp. isolated from the nasopharynx and faeces, respectively. Nasopharyngeal and faecal samples were collected weekly over 28 days from untreated beef steers and from steers injected once with tilmicosin or <b>tulathromycin</b> or continuously fed tylosin phosphate at dosages recommended by manufacturers. Tilmicosin and <b>tulathromycin</b> were effective in lowering (P < 0. 05) the prevalence of M. haemolytica, whereas subtherpeutic tylosin had no effect.

40|$|Introduction: Respiratory {{disease in}} calves is an actual problem, {{a major cause}} of {{economic}} losses due to mortality, growth delay and improper development. These conditions are frequent in calves due to the weaning stress, transport and environmental changes. Aims: The aim of this study was the isolation of bacteria from 30 calves with respiratory disorders and their antibiotic susceptibility testing. Materials and methods: Samples were collected from calves with respiratory disorders (nasal discharge) aged 6 to 9 weeks in 2 series, using sterile swabs. Samples were initially inoculated on blood agar and MacConkey agar following the characteristics of the colonies and microscopic examination that enabled the identification of bacterial species. Isolated strains were used to flood Mueller-Hinton agar to carry out sensitivity testing. The antibiotics tested were represented by: Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, Gentamicin, Florfenicol, Enrofloxacin, Marbofloxacin, Penicillin G, Cefquinone, <b>Tulathromycin,</b> Ceftiofur, Tylosin and Cephalotin. Results: Genus Streptococcus have been identified in 23 samples, followed by Staphylococcus identified in 14 samples, and Bacillus spp., in 10 nasal swabs; The most common bacteria associations were represented by Streptococcus-Staphylococcus, Streptococcus-Staphylococcus-Bacillus, and Streptococcus-E. coli. The most efficient antibiotic was Cefquinome (Cobactan), followed by Penicillin G and Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (Amoxiclav); the least effective antibiotics were Florfenicol and <b>Tulathromycin.</b> Conclusions: The study carried out on nasal discharge samples collected from calves with respiratory disorders and their antimicrobial profile testing led to the following conclusions: 1) Low susceptibility to Florfenicol is caused by previous treatments when this molecule was excessively used and without prior sensitivity testing. 2) Cefquinome may represent an emergency therapeutic antibiotic for respiratory infections in calves, but the administration should always be preceded by susceptibility testing of the isolates...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} test the {{efficacy}} of samplings {{for the detection of}} Haemophilus parasuis after metaphylactic treatment and subsequent challenge using an established model for Glässer’s disease. In this model, 36 piglets were equally assigned to a negative control, a positive control, and two trial groups receiving <b>tulathromycin</b> 7 or 4 days prior to challenge. The piglets of three groups were challenged intratracheally with H. parasuis serovar 5. As a result, four pigs in each challenged group died or had to be euthanised within 10 days post challenge. The remaining 15 pigs of these challenged groups survived until termination of the experiment (days 14 – 15). All pigs were necropsied and collective swabs of serosal surfaces were tested by bacterial culture and PCR. Samples of tarsal synovial fluid and joint capsule, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain swabs were tested by PCR. A total of 22 out of the 27 challenged animals had macroscopically detectable polyserositis and all of them tested positive in the collective swab samples. Haemophilus parasuis was more frequently detected in pigs that died within the first 10 days compared to those surviving until days 14 – 15 (P < 0. 001), and those that succumbed within 10 days showed higher positivity rates in the brain and CSF. All pigs which were positive in the CSF had detectable meningitis. At days 14 – 15, joint samples from 5 of the remaining 15 pigs tested positive for H. parasuis.
