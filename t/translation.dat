5|$|After its {{publication}} in German and its <b>translation</b> into Dutch, the novel received moderate attention. It gained an international audience when the English <b>translation</b> by Michael Hofmann {{was published in}} 1996. In 1998 this <b>translation</b> won the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, the largest prize given for a single work of fiction published in English. Following the announcement that Müller was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Literature, The Land of Green Plums entered the bestseller list on Amazon.com.|$|E

50|$|Messianic Bible <b>translations</b> are <b>translations,</b> or {{editions of}} <b>translations,</b> in English of the Christian Bible, {{some of which}} are widely used within Messianic Judaism. They {{are not the same as}} Jewish English Bible <b>translations.</b>|$|R

5|$|Modern Swedish (Swedish: nysvenska) {{begins with}} the advent of the {{printing}} press and the European Reformation. After assuming power, the new monarch Gustav Vasa ordered a Swedish <b>translation</b> of the Bible. The New Testament was published in 1526, followed by a full Bible <b>translation</b> in 1541, usually referred to as the Gustav Vasa Bible, a <b>translation</b> deemed so successful and influential that, with revisions incorporated in successive editions, it remained the most common Bible <b>translation</b> until 1917. The main translators were Laurentius Andreæ and the brothers Laurentius and Olaus Petri.|$|E
5|$|Other early {{translations}} {{include an}} 1876 Czech <b>translation</b> by E. Züngel {{for a performance}} in Prague; two Swedish versions for 1876 Stockholm performances by A. Lindgren and E.

5|$|The I Ching {{has been}} {{translated}} into Western languages dozens of times. The most influential edition is the 1923 German <b>translation</b> of Richard Wilhelm, later translated to English by Cary Baynes. The earliest complete published I Ching <b>translation</b> in a Western language was a Latin <b>translation</b> done in the 1730s by Jesuit missionary Jean-Baptiste Régis that was published in Germany in the 1830s. Although Thomas McClatchie and James Legge had both translated the text in the 19th century, the text gained significant traction during the counterculture of the 1960s, with the translations of Wilhelm and John Blofeld attracting particular interest. Richard Rutt's 1996 <b>translation</b> incorporated {{much of the new}} archaeological and philological discoveries of the 20th century. Gregory Whincup's 1986 <b>translation</b> also attempts to reconstruct Zhou period readings.|$|E

5|$|The early {{models for}} the Imagist group were from Japan, and H.D. often visited the {{exclusive}} Print Room at the British Museum {{in the company of}} Richard Aldington and the curator and poet Laurence Binyon in order to examine Nishiki-e prints that incorporated traditional Japanese verse. However, she also derived her way of making poems from her reading of Classical Greek literature and especially of Sappho, an interest she shared with Aldington and Pound, each of whom produced versions of the Greek poet's work. In 1915, H.D. and Aldington launched the Poets' <b>Translation</b> Series, pamphlets of translations from Greek and Latin classics. H.D. worked on the plays by Euripides, publishing in 1916 a <b>translation</b> of choruses from Iphigeneia at Aulis, in 1919 a <b>translation</b> of choruses from Iphigeneia at Aulis and Hippolytus, an adaptation of Hippolytus called Hippolytus Temporizes (1927), a <b>translation</b> of choruses from The Bacchae and Hecuba (1931), and Euripides' Ion (1937) a loose <b>translation</b> of Ion.|$|E

Not included in this overview are: lectionaries, <b>translations</b> of individual Bible books, selected Psalms published in Kajkavian and Chakavian dialects; free literary <b>translations</b> and poetic renderings of the Psalms, {{as well as those}} that were published in magazines; individual <b>translations</b> of apocryphal (deutero canonical) books; working, preliminary and exegetical <b>translations</b> in academic journals, handbooks and photocopied course materials; Bible <b>translations</b> of Croatian minorities abroad...|$|R
50|$|Jewish <b>translations</b> often {{also reflect}} {{traditional}} Jewish {{interpretations of the}} Bible, {{as opposed to the}} Christian understanding that is often reflected in non-Jewish <b>translations.</b> For example, Jewish <b>translations</b> translate עלמה ‘almâh in Isaiah 7:14 as young woman, while many Christian <b>translations</b> render the word as virgin.|$|R

5|$|There exists no one {{definitive}} English <b>translation</b> of {{the decree}} {{because of the}} minor differences between the three original texts, and because modern understanding of the ancient languages continues to develop. An up-to-date <b>translation</b> by R. S. Simpson appears on the British Museum website, based on the demotic text. It can be compared with Edwyn R. Bevan's full <b>translation</b> in The House of Ptolemy (1927), based on the Greek text with footnote comments on variations between this and the two Egyptian texts.|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} {{been a number of}} {{translations}} which aim to present the Gododdin as literature rather than as a subject of scholarly study. Examples are the <b>translation</b> by Joseph P. Clancy in The earliest Welsh poetry (1970) and Steve Short's 1994 <b>translation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Type I systems {{sometimes}} {{include a}} third component. In {{the case of}} the well-characterised hok/sok system, in addition to the hok toxin and sok antitoxin, there is a third gene, called mok. This open reading frame almost entirely overlaps that of the toxin, and the <b>translation</b> of the toxin is dependent on the <b>translation</b> of this third component. Thus the binding of antitoxin to toxin is sometimes a simplification, and the antitoxin in fact binds a third RNA, which then affects toxin <b>translation.</b>|$|E
