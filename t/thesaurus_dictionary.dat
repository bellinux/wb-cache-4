40|$|This work {{represents}} {{a first step}} in the direction of reconstructing a diachronic morphology for Romanian. The main resource used in this task is the digital version of the Romanian Language <b>Thesaurus</b> <b>Dictionary</b> (eDTLR). This resource offers various usage examples for its entries, citations extracted from old and modern Romanian texts. The concept of “word deformation ” is introduced and classified into more categories. The research conducted aims at detecting one type of such deformations occurring in the citations – changes only in the root of the old form words, without the migration to another paradigm. An algorithm is presented which automatically infers old root forms, and which is based on a paradigmatic data model of the current Romanian morphology. Having the inferred roots and the paradigms that they are part of, old flexion forms of the words can be deduced. Even more, by exploiting the chronology of the citations, the inferred old word forms can be framed in certain periods of time, finally configuring an important linguistic resource for researchers interested {{in the evolution of the}} Romanian language...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a first step}} towards constructing the diachronic Romanian morphology. First, the "deformation " of a word is introduced and a classification of such deformations is proposed. The conducted research aims at detecting deformations in the roots of inflectional words (nouns, adjectives and verbs). The algorithm we present uses two important resources: a morphological dictionary of the current Romanian language, which also models the inflectional paradigms of the language, and eDTLR – the digital version of the Romanian <b>Thesaurus</b> <b>Dictionary.</b> In eDTLR each title word has associated a set of citations extracted from the Romanian literature, each having attached the year of publication. The algorithm detects root deformations in words by comparing word forms of the current language with forms extracted from the eDTLR citations. For every root change, the deformed root is deducted and all the diachronic forms are inferred. Also, using the chronology of citations, for each diachronic root a period or a year is established. The research was conducted on 4 volumes of eDTLR. The algorithm successfully detected 2, 700 root deformations and inferred a total of 30, 000 diachronic inflexions. 1.

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at finding out the {{attitude}} of the English Department students' toward the learning of writing using Ms. Word in the multimedia laboratory at Widya Mandala Surabaya Catholic University (henceforth it is abbreviated to WMSCU), and the reasons of their attitude. This study is based on the theory of attitude, which comprises of three components-affective, behavioral, and cognitive components. A descriptive qualitative survey was applied as the research design of this study. Questionnaire, in-depth interview, and the researcher were the instruments of this study. Sixty-one students at the English Department of WMSCU, who took writing classes using Ms. Word in the multimedia laboratory, were chosen as the subjects using convenience sampling. In analyzing the data, options "strongly Agree" and "Agree" were considered as positive response, while options "Disagree" and "Strongly Disagree" were considered as negative response. The analysis of questionnaire discovered that the subjects held positive attitude to ward learning writing using Ms. Word in the multimedia laboratory at WMSCU. Ms. Word benefited their writing with its features {{was one of the reasons}} of having positive attitude. Spelling and grammar checker and <b>thesaurus</b> <b>dictionary</b> was helpful in minimizing the grammar and spelling errors. Meanwhile, page formatting, paragraph formatting, and editing text facilitated the arrangement of paragraph and paragraph neatness. Word count benefited the students when they had to write composition that contained certain number of words. Track changes and insert and view comments improved the student's writing with the comments from the lecturer. Another reason was the writing class using Ms. Word was enjoyable since the students had their own PCs (they could write according to their time and pace) and the lecturer used different delivery techniques. Since the students held positive attitude toward that writing class using Ms. Word, they claimed that they had positive behavior, such as: coming to the class on time, submitting the writing assignments on time, trying not to be absent, and looking for information about writing class during their absence...|$|E
