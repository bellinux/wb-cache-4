5000|$|Diffusion Capacitance is the {{capacitance}} due to transport of charge carriers between two terminals of a device, for example, {{the diffusion of}} carriers from anode to cathode in forward bias mode of a diode or from emitter to baseforward-biased junction for a transistor. In a semiconductor device with a current flowing through it (for example, an ongoing transport of charge by diffusion) at a particular moment there is necessarily some charge {{in the process of}} transit through the device. If the applied voltage changes to a different value and the current changes to a different value, a different amount of charge will be in transit in the new circumstances. The change in the amount of <b>transiting</b> <b>charge</b> divided by the change in the voltage causing it is the diffusion capacitance. The adjective [...] "diffusion" [...] is used because the original use of this term was for junction diodes, where the charge transport was via the diffusion mechanism.

40|$|Abstract — New Internet {{protocols}} such as ECN, re-ECN and Conex, {{provide valuable}} information to ISPs about the congestion within a network. Such information {{could be useful}} in allocating network resources more equitably, {{as well as to}} employ new pricing schemes. However, in designing a new protocol one must take proper account of the incentive issues that thereby arise for its adoption. In this paper, we consider a duopoly market consisting of two access ISPs and formulate a noncooperative game over their choices of pricing strategies when one of them uses volume-based and the other congestion-based pricing. We prove, under mild conditions, the existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium for the competing providers. We further examine how the different types of <b>transit</b> <b>charges</b> affect the pricing strategies of the access ISPs. We find cases where the volume charging ISP is forced to leave the access market. We conclude that ISPs have economic incentives to adopt congestion accountability mechanisms, since they become more competitive due to the smoother and more predictable traffic they have to accommodate and to the lower <b>transit</b> <b>charges</b> they incur.

Like Glazer and Niskanen (2000) it studies congestion tolls with heterogeneous commuters, but focuses on welfare effects and extends their model to include a choice of departure time, as well as travel mode. The author finds that tolls can be welfare improving even if the public transit mode normally used for substitution is also congested. If, for some reason, public <b>transit</b> <b>charges</b> cannot be changed, substitution towards off-peak travel can be stimulated by a combined road toll and parking duties policy made possible by modern automatic vehicle-identification technologies. © 2005 LSE and the University of Bath...|$|E

40|$|The Kiel Canal in Germany connects ports on the Baltic Sea {{with the}} rest of the world and is the most-used {{artificial}} waterway in the world. Despite this fact, it generates a balance sheet loss. Revenues, which are mainly generated by the transit charge, do not cover its operating expenses. This situation raises the question: What reforms could be made to make the canal generate a balance sheet profit? In this paper, we focus solely on the canal’s revenue. Because the canal is a monopoly that allows, in principle, for perfect price discrimination, we contrast the current charging system with an optimal charging system based on the willingness-to-pay (WTP) approach. We devise a general approach to calculate optimal <b>transit</b> <b>charges</b> and apply it in a case study that includes four different ship types. We conclude that much higher revenues could be generated, on the order of between $ 5 and $ 45 million more per year and ship type if the transit charge were based not only on ship size but also on a ship’s departure and destination portsoptimal transit charge, Kiel Canal, shipping cost, Germany, price discrimination...|$|E

40|$|The {{maritime}} transport sector (henceforth shipping sector) {{can be seen}} as the backbone of globalization since it transports 80 % of the merchandise traded internationally (UNCTAD, 2008). It transported about 8. 4 billion tons of merchandise throughout the world in 2010 (UNCTAD, 2011). Needless to say, the shipping sector is a global sector. Over 170 countries are engaged as maritime states (IMO, 2013). Ships are globally mobile and can have multiple nationalities, i. e., ships can be owned and operated by different nationalities, and registered in different countries. Furthermore, ships are subject to multiple regulations, such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the Conventions of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the laws of the flag states, and the laws of the coastal states (Stopford, 2009). Thus, regulating such a global sector is a challenging task. The papers presented in this cumulative dissertation deal with economic aspects of regulating this global sector in two areas of interest. Thus, the dissertation is divided into two parts. Part I (first paper) deals with regulating the <b>transit</b> <b>charges</b> of an interna-tional waterway in the context of price discrimination. Part II (second, third, and fourth paper), which is the main emphasis of the dissertation, deals with regulating CO 2 emissions of the shipping sector in the context of climate change policy...|$|E
40|$|Peering {{arrangements}} between Internet Service Providers (ISPs), {{in which}} providers agree to carry traffic originating from a peer, {{are common in}} the Internet. A common contractual peering agreement between smaller ISPs is "Bill-and-Keep", where no money changes hands between the peers. This paper first investigates a situation when ISPs {{who have access to}} a transit ISP capable of handling their traffic for a fee, decide to peer incurring some fixed peering cost. Using a simple model it is shown that Bill-and-Keep peering is the fair and efficient outcome if the transit ISP charges for both inbound and outbound traffic and <b>transit</b> <b>charges</b> as well as costs of peering are symmetric. Next, complementarity between providers at the operational level, as measured by improvement in quality of service (QoS), is analyzed using an idealized model. Assuming that each provider incurs costs, or degradation in QoS, from its traffic traversing its own as well as the peer's links and chooses the amount of traffic to send on its peers' links in its self-interest, the Nash equilibria of the resulting one shot game and then of an infinitely repeated game are analyzed. For the one-shot game, it is established that, while it is not possible for all the providers to be worse off, it is certainly possible for all of them to be better off. An intuitive sufficient condition for each of the providers to be better off in Nash equilibrium is then derived. Further, it is shown that providers that are better off in the one-shot game can cooperate using threat strategies in an infinitely repeated game and can each be even better off. Coalition formation between peers as a dynamic process is also investigated and some examples and conjectures on some preliminary findings are provided. Finally, the policy implications of the findings are discussed. ISP peering Bill-and-Keep peering Shapley value Quality of service Nash equilibrium Coalition formation...|$|E

40|$|The {{generation}} and <b>transit</b> of <b>charge</b> packets in 150 μm thick peelings from the insulation of Medium Voltage Cables manufactured {{using the same}} XLPE batch have been investigated {{at a number of}} different temperatures. Charge packet motion was investigated in peelings taken from cables that have been electro-thermally stressed at T= 90 degrees C for 5000 hours with a Laplacian field E ≈ 20 kV/mm at the location of the samples. It was found that charge packets were generated by an applied field of 120 kV/mm when the internal space charge field reached 140 - 150 kV/mm. Measurements were made in three controlled temperature environments and {{it was found that the}} transit time fitted an Arrhenius behaviour with an activation energy of ~ 1. 2 eV. This value is similar to estimates made for the deepest traps (> 1. 1 eV) made from the decay of space charge accumulated at lower fields of 46. 67 kVmm. It is also close to the activation energy for the conductivity (~ 1. 25 eV) obtained from the dielectric spectroscopy of unpeeled cable sections at Erms ≈ 0. 41 V/mm, and ~ 1. 15 eV from the dielectric spectroscopy of the peelings (E = 40 V/mm).
