6000|$|Almayer's {{difficulties}} were by {{no means}} diminished by the girl's presence in Sambir. The stir caused by her arrival had died out, it is true, and Lakamba had not renewed his visits; but about a year after the departure of the man-of-war boats the nephew of Abdulla, Syed Reshid, returned from his pilgrimage to Mecca, rejoicing in a green jacket and the proud <b>title</b> of <b>Hadji.</b> There was a great letting off of rockets on board the steamer which brought him in, and a great beating of drums all night in Abdulla's compound, while the feast of welcome was prolonged far into the small hours of the morning. Reshid was the favourite nephew and heir of Abdulla, and that loving uncle, meeting Almayer one day by the riverside, stopped politely to exchange civilities and to ask solemnly for an interview. Almayer suspected some attempt at a swindle, or at any rate something unpleasant, but of course consented with a great show of rejoicing. Accordingly the next evening, after sunset, Abdulla came, accompanied by several other grey-beards and by his nephew. That young man--of a very rakish and dissipated appearance--affected the greatest indifference as to the whole of the proceedings. When the torch-bearers had grouped themselves below the steps, and the visitors had seated themselves on various lame chairs, Reshid stood apart in the shadow, examining his aristocratically small hands with great attention. Almayer, surprised by the great solemnity of his visitors, perched himself {{on the corner of the}} table with a characteristic want of dignity quickly noted by the Arabs with grave disapproval. But Abdulla spoke now, looking straight past Almayer at the red curtain hanging in the doorway, where a slight tremor disclosed the presence of women on the other side. He began by neatly complimenting Almayer upon the long years they had dwelt together in cordial neighbourhood, and called upon Allah to give him many more years to gladden the eyes of his friends by his welcome presence. He made a polite allusion to the great consideration shown him (Almayer) by the Dutch [...] "Commissie," [...] and drew thence the flattering inference of Almayer's great importance amongst his own people. He--Abdulla--was also important amongst all the Arabs, and his nephew Reshid would be heir of that social position and of great riches. Now Reshid was a Hadji. He was possessor of several Malay women, went on Abdulla, but it was time he had a favourite wife, the first of the four allowed by the Prophet. And, speaking with well-bred politeness, he explained further to the dumbfounded Almayer that, if he would consent to the alliance of his offspring with that true believer and virtuous man Reshid, she would be the mistress of all the splendours of Reshid's house, and first wife of the first Arab in the Islands, when he--Abdulla--was called to the joys of Paradise by Allah the All-merciful. [...] "You know, Tuan," [...] he said, in conclusion, [...] "the other women would be her slaves, and Reshid's house is great. From Bombay he has brought great divans, and costly carpets, and European furniture. There is also a great looking-glass in a frame shining like gold. What could a girl want more?" [...] And while Almayer looked upon him in silent dismay Abdulla spoke in a more confidential tone, waving his attendants away, and finished his speech by pointing out the material advantages of such an alliance, and offering to settle upon Almayer three thousand dollars as a sign of his sincere friendship and the price of the girl.|$|R
5000|$|Dalliu {{was born}} in Tirana in 1878, in a middle class Moslem family, son of Mustafa Dalliu. He had two brothers, Hysni and Ali, both bearing <b>titles</b> hafiz and <b>hadji.</b> Ibrahim was an early {{childhood}} friend of Seremedin and Murat Toptani, with whom he kept close ties {{for the rest of}} hist life. He studied theology in Istanbul. There he came in contact with the activists of the Central Committee for Defending Albanian Rights. He returned to Tirana where he started working as a teacher in 1901. At the same time {{he was a member of}} the local branch of the Bashkimi (Unity) Club, one of the many of that time throughout all Albanian populated areas. He participated in the Congress of Elbasan, during 2-9 September 1909, as part of the Tirana delegation. One of the Congress's main achievement was the establishment of the Normal School of Elbasan which would prepare teachers for supporting the spread of Albanian education. He was imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities during 1909-1911 due to his nationalist activity. On 26 November 1912, Dalliu was an active participant in the ceremony of raising the Albanian flag in Tirana, 2 days before the National Declaration of Independence. At the same time he drafted a letter-protest which was sent to the Serbian army approaching from the north.From April 25 to May 3, 1921, he took part in the Congress for National Unity in Vlora, together with Musa Maçi as representatives of the society [...] "Lidhja Kombëtare" [...] (National League), Qazim Mulleti of Tirana's society [...] "Vllaznia-Zgjimi" [...] (Brotherhood - Awakening), and Avni Rustemi for the society [...] "Bashkimi" [...] (Union). During the interbellum period, Dalliu focused on teaching, writing, and translation. He is remembered in Albanian as one of the few high rank clerics who were devoted to the national cause as well as to religion. He taught for many years at the Madrasa of Tirana and wrote many work and studies on Islam. He also wrote satirical poetry, and published the newspaper Dajti (Dajt).He was part of the National Assembly in 1943. With the rise of the communists in power in 1944, he was arrested and imprisoned due to his engagement in politics and some sharp anti-communist poetry he had written. Dalliu died in jail on 25 May 1952, and was annihilated by the communist historiography.|$|R
