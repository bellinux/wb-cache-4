25|$|The devil, {{dressed in}} a monk's habit and with fearsome teeth, holds out some stones {{in his left hand}} and a globe in his right hand. He teases Jesus asking him to turn the stones into bread and telling Jesus, with {{reference}} to the globe, that he could be the ruler of the entire world if he chose to be so. Between the devil and the second image of Jesus we see Jesus wearing the crown of thorns, his hands bound and held by a soldier. He is appearing before Pontius Pilate who is seated and wears a turban. He touches his thumb with his left index finger to show that he is speaking. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> a second image of Jesus but without the crown of thorns. To understand this scene it is best to see the image of the devil and the image of Christ without the crown of thorns as apparitions and speaking across Pontius and that group.|$|E
25|$|Jesus' arrest. Eight statues {{tell the}} story of Jesus' arrest. First, we have a helmeted guard in armour who holds a rope in his hand and to his left is Saint Peter brandishing the sword with which he has cut off Malchus' ear. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> Jesus and Judas and at their feet Malchus who has fallen {{backward}} to the ground after being struck by Saint Peter and has dropped the lantern he was carrying. He tries to steady himself by holding on Jesus' arm. Judas stands close to Jesus holding the purse no doubt containing the reward for his treachery. He has either kissed Jesus or is about to do so. Then we have three other guards who will make the arrest. The one in the middle holds a sword. Jesus is then led before Caiaphas who is seated and holds a sceptre and wears a crown, symbols of his power.|$|E

25|$|In 1792 the French revolutionary troops, {{under the}} command of Montesquiou, were in Savoy. The {{civilian}} use of the spa then stalled. The baths were requisitioned by the armies of the Republic, which sent the wounded soldiers for convalescence. However, it was also an opportunity to publicise Aix to the greatest number. Aix became Aix-les-Bains. With the Revolution accomplished, the privileges of the local nobility were abolished, and this especially helped the town from paying the Lord Marquess of Aix the large sum of money which it owed him for the redemption of seigneurial rights (the town had no charter of franchise). Furthermore, freedom of established trade gave new impetus to the creation of an economy based on the exploitation of the springs as soon as peace was regained. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> the development of boarding houses, hotels, cabarets and restaurants. On the other hand, the Revolution left its marks on church property, such as the abandonment of the collegiate church, destruction of the bell tower and the church furniture.|$|E
25|$|On {{the upper}} surface {{we have a}} {{depiction}} of the distressed Virgin Mary being supported by John the Evangelist and two female saints ("Pamoison de la Vierge"), Mary Magdalene and Mary Salome. In the next scene Jesus is being flogged by two soldiers who tighten the blindfold as they apply their whips. On the frieze below the first sculpture on the left shows Elizabeth (biblical figure) visiting the Virgin Mary (the Visitation (Christianity)), the one pregnant with Jesus Christ {{and the other with}} John the Baptist, this being followed by three scenes relating to the nativity. Firstly we see Saint Joseph sleeping in the stable with two cattle next to him. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> the Virgin Mary laying in a bed {{and at the end of}} this bed is a depiction of a standing Jesus aged about 7 years this followed by the Adoration of the Magi. The first wise man is kneeling before the bed whilst the second, dressed in the doublet worn in the reign of Charles VII, is pointing with his finger to the star which led them to the stable and addressing the third wise man who is smaller in stature.|$|E

[...] To solve his dilemma, Gunn chose to have Ronan kill [...] "The Other", Thanos' vizier, saying, [...] "I thought that was interesting, because we’ve had the Other, who’s obviously very powerful even in comparison to Loki, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> Ronan wipe his ass with him. So that I liked, but even that was sort of difficult, because it played as funnier when I first wrote it, and the humor didn’t work so much." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 10, 2009, a fan fiction contest was {{launched}} on Spears' official website. The {{winner of the}} contest would get to see their story becoming a plot for an official music video of a song. Later, {{it was revealed that}} Argentine Eliana Moyano had won the contest with her concept for [...] "Kill the Lights" [...] revealed on February 11, 2009, titled [...] "Known Everywhere", while an exclusive preview was released on May 18, 2009. The animated music video, directed by PUNY, debuted on July 27, 2009, and was released for purchase via iTunes on September 4, 2009. The video begins with an animated Danja saying his introduction of the song, while paparazzi are in the background taking several pictures. <b>Then,</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> an animated Spears jumping into her rocket ship, flying and avoiding several paparazzi that are following her. She hides on another planet, turning all the lights of it on as she walks, and escaping the paparazzi that later appear to stalk her. However, Spears manages to avoid them, flying away into space in her rocket ship again, but this time exploding the planet and [...] "killing all the lights" [...] of it maneuvering a joystick.|$|E
500|$|A {{published}} synopsis in The Nickelodeon {{reads as}} follows, [...] "The night before Christmas, Alice, {{a child of}} wealth, after going through the usual form of hanging up her stocking, is put to bed by her maid. Alice falls asleep and dreams. Enter Santa Claus and Gnomes who tell Alice to follow her and they will show her part of their Funnyland. Alice follows the little people under the special protection of a policeman two foot high. The little party are seen trotting through beautiful glens and dales until they reach Funnyland. Santa Claus tells {{her that if she}} is a good girl all the animals and toys here are hers; as Alice touches each one they come to life. The teddy bear steps out to dance with Alice. As Alice removes the cover from Doll's box the doll dances out, a little king gives a magical entertainment, a clown is very active and all the animals and dolls do some interesting act much to the surprise and delight of little Alice. At last, tired out, Alice falls asleep reclining upon the shoulders of Teddy bear. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> her again back in her own little bed. It is now Christmas morning. Her maid awakens and dresses her for the great event, takes her to the drawing room where she is welcomed by her parents to find that her dream has come true." [...] Originally the film was billed as being released for December 19, 1910 and then it was later claimed to be December 26, 1910. This release was attributed in an issue of The Nickelodeon. However, the film was not released on December 19 because an advertisement in Moving Picture World in January 1911 said that the release would be delayed for a [...] "few days". It is unknown, and unlikely, if the film actually was released because no other publications, ads or materials surrounding the Gnome Motion Picture Company followed.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the scene}} {{depicting}} Jesus' arrest, Judas stands beneath Malchus' lantern holding his purse. Peter and James are sleeping but Peter's hand rests on his sword. Judas appears again when Jesus is shown standing between two soldiers who have arrested him. Judas leans towards Jesus ready {{to kiss him}} and thus betray his identity. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> Peter with Malchus crying out in pain laying at his feet, a hand [...] to the wound where Peter had cut off his ear.|$|E

A man stands holding a linen shroud. Mary is being supported by John and Mary Magdalene holds her pot of oil. Finally, we see Jesus being taken before Annas the father in law of Caiaphas. Annas does not want to get involved and sends the accused to appear before Caiaphas.|$|E

2500|$|The {{music video}} to [...] "Better on the Other Side" [...] was {{released}} on June 30, 2009. The video was recorded and released within ten hours. The music video begins with clips of fans' tribute to Jackson outside the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where Jackson was pronounced dead at. Shortly after Diddy's part of the song begins to play, the voice of Diddy, who isn't seen throughout the entire video, is heard. Clips shown in the being of the video show a young fan holding a poster that reads [...] "R.I.P. Michael Jackson". From there are seen more images of fans, some mourning Jackson, some celebrating him by doing Jackson's signature dances and dressing like him. The Game begins rapping while lying in a bathtub, fully clothed and drinking as {{the water in the}} tub runs. Brown is shown moments after that, bobbing his head to the music. The video then goes back and forth between recording sessions for the song and tributes from Jackson's fans. The Game is shown in the studio with Brown, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> Boyz II Men's Wanya Morris recording and singing his part on the record. We then see Game writing his rhyme for the song and, later, getting a new tattoo on his right arm. As the video ends, The Game stands up in the bathtub, takes off his shirt and reveals his new Michael Jackson tattoo. It is a picture of Jackson wearing a fedora and a mask on his face.|$|E
2500|$|Queen Isabella, Queen to Edward II, {{surrendered}} it {{with her}} other lands in 1330 and it formed part of next Queen Philippa of Hainault's dower in January 1330–31. After an intriguing further incidence of exhortation, many years later Sir Bryan Stapilton held it for life, followed by James Fiennes, 1st Baron Saye and Sele, soldier and politician. [...] He was put to death during the Kentish rebellion of Jack Cade, and the Manor passed to the King's brother Jasper Tudor (created Duke of Bedford, Earl of Pembroke); when the Wars of the Roses raged the Earl of Kent was awarded it, followed by the soon-to-be executed George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> still more royal holding, with stewards Sir George Brown, Sir William Fitz William, Sir Anthony Browne and Henry VIII's server of the chamber, Thomas Jones. In 1551 new Baron Saye and Sele (dubious, per Malden) Edward Clinton, 1st Earl of Lincoln sold the estate to Richard Sackville (escheator) for Surrey, who made William More of Loseley steward. Elizabeth I had it within her powers {{by the time of}} her accession to just grant the manor, possibly due to the internal wars of religion and Sir Francis Wolley (see his daughter Hannah Woolley), to Sir George More in 1605. [...] He subsequently sold the park to Sir Edward More, and the title of the Manor to Henry Bell of Rake Manor. [...] After this time the Manor was never again held by the nobility.|$|E
