5|$|The {{discovery}} of insulin at the University of Toronto in 1921 is {{considered among the}} most significant events {{in the history of}} medicine. The stem cell was discovered at the university in 1963, forming the basis for bone marrow transplantation and all subsequent research on adult and embryonic stem cells. This was the first of many findings at Toronto relating to stem cells, including the identification of pancreatic and retinal stem cells. The cancer stem cell was first identified in 1997 by Toronto researchers, who have since found stem cell associations in leukemia, brain tumors and colorectal cancer. Medical inventions developed at Toronto include the glycaemic index, the infant cereal Pablum, the use of protective hypothermia in open heart surgery and the first artificial cardiac pacemaker. The first successful single-lung transplant was performed at Toronto in 1981, followed by the first nerve transplant in 1988, and the first double-lung transplant in 1989. Researchers identified the maturation promoting factor that regulates cell division, and discovered the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor,</b> which triggers responses of the immune system. The university is credited with isolating the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases. Between 1914 and 1972, the university operated the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, now part of the pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis. Among the research conducted at the laboratory was the development of gel electrophoresis.|$|E
25|$|Double {{positive}} thymocytes {{that have}} a <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> capable of binding MHC class I or class II (even with a weak affinity) receive signalling through the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor.</b> Thymocytes {{that have a}} <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> incapable of binding MHC class I or class II undergo apoptosis. Some thymocytes are able to rescue failed positive selection by receptor editing (rearrangement of the other <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> allele to produce a new <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor).</b>|$|E
25|$|Thymocytes which pass β-selection {{express a}} <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> which {{is capable of}} {{assembling}} on the surface. However, many of these T cell receptors will still be non-functional, due to an inability to bind MHC. The next major stage of thymocyte development is positive selection, to keep only those thymocytes which have a <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> capable of binding MHC. The <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> requires CD8 as a coreceptor to bind to MHC class I, and CD4 as a coreceptor to bind MHC class II. At this stage thymocytes upregulate both CD4 and CD8, becoming double positive cells.|$|E
40|$|<b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> {{are among}} the most {{specific}} biological structures found in nature and are therefore excellent candidates for the molecular targeting of antigen. It is becoming increasingly apparent that common sets of <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> are frequently used in humans to combat pathogen and cancer derived threats. Given that many of these conserved <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> have high affinity for their target ligands, there is potential to amass virtual banks of “off-the-shelf” receptors for use {{in a wide range of}} immunotherapeutic strategies. Additionally, such <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> could become basic blueprints for artificial enhancement through mutagenesis, thereby creating an even better 3 -dimensional fit for their cognate targets. Indeed, preliminary approaches using both “natural” and “supernatural” <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> have shown promise in treating autoimmunity and malignancy. This review will discuss these studies and other approaches through which <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> can be exploited in immunodiagnostics, pathogen control and gene therapy...|$|R
50|$|The {{germline}} model {{suggests that}} MHC restriction {{is a result}} of evolutionary pressure favoring <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> that are capable of binding to MHC. The selection model suggests that not all <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> show MHC restriction, however only the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> with MHC restriction are expressed after thyme selection. In fact, both hypothesis are reflected in the determination of TCR restriction, such that both germline-encoded interactions between TCR and MHC and co-receptor interactions with CD4 or CD8 to signal <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> maturation during selection.|$|R
50|$|Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), (also {{known as}} {{chimeric}} immunoreceptors, chimeric <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptors,</b> artificial <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptors)</b> are engineered receptors, which graft an arbitrary specificity onto an immune effector <b>cell</b> (<b>T</b> <b>cell).</b> Typically, these <b>receptors</b> {{are used to}} graft the specificity of a monoclonal antibody onto a <b>T</b> <b>cell,</b> with transfer of their coding sequence facilitated by retroviral vectors. The receptors are called chimeric because they are composed of parts from different sources.|$|R
25|$|Unlike most genes, {{which have}} a stable {{sequence}} in each cell which expresses them, the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> {{is made up of}} a series of alternative gene fragments. In order to create a functional <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor,</b> the double negative thymocytes use a series of DNA-interacting enzymes to clip the DNA and bring separate gene fragments together. The outcome of this process is that each <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> has a different sequence, due to different choice of gene fragments and the errors introduced during the cutting and joining process (see section on V(D)J recombination for more information on TCR rearrangement). The evolutionary advantage in having a large number of unique T cell receptors is that each T cell is capable of recognizing a different peptide, providing a defense against rapidly evolving pathogens.|$|E

25|$|TCR {{rearrangement}} {{occurs in}} two steps. First the TCRβ chain is rearranged at the DN3 stage of T cell development. The TCRβ chain is paired with the pre-Tα {{to generate the}} pre-TCR. The cellular disadvantage in the rearrangement process {{is that many of}} the combinations of the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> gene fragments are non-functional. To eliminate thymocytes which have made a non-functional <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor,</b> only cells that have successfully rearranged the beta chain to produce a functional pre-TCR are allowed to develop beyond the DN3 stage. Cells that fail to produce a functional pre-TCR are eliminated by apoptosis. This process is referred to as the beta-selection checkpoint. Successful beta-selection requires that TCRβ is produced, TCRβ is capable of pairing with pre-Tα to generate the pre-TCR, and that the pre-TCR can interact on the cell surface with the TCR signalling proteins.|$|E

50|$|In most vertebrates, {{immune systems}} have 6 key types of proteins, which help {{the immune system}} {{recognise}} viruses, germs, etc. The 6 main types are: immunoglobulins (2), and <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> (4). Immunoglobulin proteins consist of 2 parts, a light chain and a heavy chain. <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> come in 4 types, labelled alpha, beta, gamma and delta.|$|R

ASF/SF2 action in the replication of HIV-1 is a potential target for HIV therapy. ASF/SF2 is also implicated in the production of <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, altering specific chain expression in <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> through alternative splicing.|$|R
25|$|The {{ability of}} T cells to {{recognize}} foreign antigens is {{mediated by the}} <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> (TCR), which is a surface protein able to recognize short protein sequences (peptides) that are presented on MHC. The purpose of thymocyte development is to produce mature T cells with a diverse array of functional T cell receptors, {{through the process of}} TCR gene rearrangement.|$|E
25|$|Common lymphoid {{precursor}} cells that {{migrate to the}} thymus become known as T-cell precursors (or thymocytes) and do not express a <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor.</b> Broadly speaking, the double negative (DN) stage is focused on producing a functional β-chain whereas the double positive (DP) stage is focused on producing a functional α-chain, ultimately producing a functional αβ <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor.</b> As the developing thymocyte progresses through the four DN stages (DN1, DN2, DN3, and DN4), the T cell expresses an invariant α-chain but rearranges the β-chain locus. If the rearranged β-chain successfully pairs with the invariant α-chain, signals are produced which cease rearrangement of the β-chain (and silence the alternate allele) and result in proliferation of the cell. Although these signals require this pre-TCR at the cell surface, they are independent of ligand binding to the pre-TCR. These thymocytes will then express both CD4 and CD8 and progresses to the double positive (DP) stage where selection of the α-chain takes place. If a rearranged β-chain {{does not lead to}} any signalling (e.g. {{as a result of an}} inability to pair with the invariant α-chain), the cell may die by neglect (lack of signalling).|$|E
25|$|It {{is unknown}} what role the {{relatively}} bulky extracellular region of CD45 plays during cell interactions, but CD45 has various isoforms that change in size {{depending on the}} Th cell's activation and maturation status. For example, CD45 shortens in length following Th activation (CD45RA+ to CD45RO+), but whether this change in length influences activation is unknown. It has been proposed that the larger CD45RA+ may decrease the accessibility of the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> for the antigen-MHC molecule, thereby necessitating {{an increase in the}} affinity (and specificity) of the T cell for activation. Once the activation has occurred however, CD45 shortens, allowing easier interactions and activation as an effector T helper cell.|$|E

25|$|The double {{positive}} thymocytes undergo lineage commitment, maturing into a CD8+ T cell (recognising MHC class I) or a CD4+ T cell (recognising MHC class II). Lineage commitment {{occurs at}} the late stage of positive selection and works by downregulation of both CD4 and CD8 (reducing the signal from the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor)</b> and then upregulation of CD4 only. Thymocytes that start receiving signal again are those that recognise MHC class II, and they become CD4+ T cells. Thymocytes that do not start receiving signal again are those that recognize MHC class I, and they downregulate CD4 and upregulate CD8, to become CD8+ T cells. Both of these thymocytes types are known as single positive thymocytes.|$|E
25|$|The key {{disadvantage}} in a gene rearrangement process for T cell receptors {{is that by}} random chance, some arrangements of gene fragments will create a <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> capable of binding self-peptides presented on MHC class I or MHC class II. If T cells bearing these T cell receptors were to enter the periphery, they {{would be capable of}} activating an immune response against self, resulting in autoimmunity. Negative selection is the process evolved to reduce this risk. During negative selection, all thymocytes with a high affinity for binding self peptides presented on MHC class I or class II are induced to upregulate BCL2L11, a protein which drives apoptosis. Cells which do not have a high affinity for self-antigens survive negative selection. At this stage, some cells are also selected to become regulatory T cells, usually cells which have an intermediate affinity for self-peptide.|$|E
500|$|Dendritic cells also promote {{immunological}} tolerance, which {{stops the}} body from attacking itself. The first type of tolerance is central tolerance, that occurs in the thymus.

The second type of immunological tolerance is peripheral tolerance.|$|E

500|$|Complete {{stimulation}} of T helper cells requires the B7 molecule {{present on the}} antigen presenting cell to bind with CD28 molecule present on the T cell surface (in close proximity with the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor).</b> Likewise, a second interaction between the CD40 ligand or CD154 (CD40L) present on T cell surface and CD40 present on B cell surface, is also necessary. The same interactions that stimulate the T helper cell also stimulate the B cell, hence the term costimulation. The entire mechanism ensures that an activated T cell only stimulates a B cell that recognizes the antigen containing the same epitope as recognized by the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> of the [...] "costimulating" [...] T helper cell. The B cell gets stimulated, apart from the direct costimulation, by certain growth factors, viz., interleukins 2, 4, 5, and 6 in a paracrine fashion. These factors are usually produced by the newly activated T helper cell. However, this activation occurs only after the B cell receptor present on a memory or a naive B cell itself would have bound to the corresponding epitope, without which the initiating steps of phagocytosis and antigen processing would not have occurred.|$|E

500|$|Pathogens {{synthesize}} {{proteins that}} can serve as [...] "recognizable" [...] antigens; they may express the molecules on their surface or release them into the surroundings (body fluids). What makes these substances recognizable is that they bind very specifically and somewhat strongly to certain host proteins called antibodies. The same antibodies can be anchored {{to the surface of}} cells of the immune system, in which case they serve as receptors, or they can be secreted in the blood, known as soluble antibodies. On a molecular scale, the proteins are relatively large, so they cannot be recognized as a whole; instead, their segments, called epitopes, can be recognized. An epitope comes in contact with a very small region (of 15–22 amino acids) of the antibody molecule; this region is known as [...] the paratope. In the immune system, membrane-bound antibodies are the B cell receptor (BCR). Also, while the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> is not biochemically [...] classified as an antibody, it serves a similar function in that it specifically binds to epitopes complexed with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. The binding between a paratope and its corresponding antigen is very specific, owing to its structure, and is guided by various noncovalent bonds, not unlike the pairing of other types of ligands (any atom, ion or molecule that binds with any receptor with at least some degree of specificity and strength). The specificity of binding does not arise out of a rigid lock and key type of interaction, but rather requires both the paratope and the epitope to undergo slight conformational changes in each other's presence.|$|E

5000|$|Each <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> recognizes a {{specific}} antigen {{when it is}} presented in complex with a MHC molecule by an antigen presenting cell.

Subsequently, <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> with <b>receptors</b> that recognize the body's own proteins need to be eliminated while still in the thymus. Through the action of AIRE, medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEC) express major proteins from elsewhere in the body (so called [...] "tissue-restricted antigens" [...] - TRA) and <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> that respond to those proteins are eliminated through cell death (apoptosis).
