5|$|The {{efficiency}} of an enzyme {{can be expressed}} in terms of kcat/Km. This is also called <b>the</b> <b>specificity</b> constant and incorporates the rate constants for all steps in the reaction up to and including the first irreversible step. Because <b>the</b> <b>specificity</b> constant reflects both affinity and catalytic ability, it is useful for comparing different enzymes against each other, or the same enzyme with different substrates. The theoretical maximum for <b>the</b> <b>specificity</b> constant is called the diffusion limit and is about 108 to 109 (M−1 s−1). At this point every collision of the enzyme with its substrate will result in catalysis, and the rate of product formation is not limited by the reaction rate but by the diffusion rate. Enzymes with this property are called catalytically perfect or kinetically perfect. Example of such enzymes are triose-phosphate isomerase, carbonic anhydrase, acetylcholinesterase, catalase, fumarase, β-lactamase, and superoxide dismutase. The turnover of such enzymes can reach several million reactions per second.|$|E
5|$|Immunology {{made a great}} advance {{towards the}} end of the 19th century, through rapid developments, in the study of humoral {{immunity}} and cellular immunity. Particularly important was the work of Paul Ehrlich, who proposed the side-chain theory to explain <b>the</b> <b>specificity</b> of the antigen-antibody reaction; his contributions to the understanding of humoral immunity were recognized by the award of a Nobel Prize in 1908, which was jointly awarded to the founder of cellular immunology, Elie Metchnikoff.|$|E

5|$|The {{dominant}} {{producers of}} iodine today are Chile and Japan. Iodine {{and its compounds}} are primarily used in nutrition. Due to its high atomic number and ease of attachment to organic compounds, it has also found favour as a non-toxic radiocontrast material. Because of <b>the</b> <b>specificity</b> of its uptake by the human body, radioactive isotopes of iodine {{can also be used}} to treat thyroid cancer. Iodine is also used as a catalyst in the industrial production of acetic acid and some polymers.|$|E
5|$|One {{reason for}} the {{popularity}} of the local protein synthesis hypothesis is that it provides a possible mechanism for <b>the</b> <b>specificity</b> associated with LTP. Specifically, if indeed local protein synthesis underlies L-LTP, only dendritic spines receiving LTP-inducing stimuli will undergo LTP; the potentiation will not be propagated to adjacent synapses. By contrast, global protein synthesis that occurs in the cell body requires that proteins be shipped out to every area of the cell, including synapses that have not received LTP-inducing stimuli. Whereas local protein synthesis provides a mechanism for specificity, global protein synthesis would seem to directly compromise it. However, as discussed later, the synaptic tagging hypothesis successfully reconciles global protein synthesis, synapse specificity, and associativity.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>specificity</b> of RSTs for the {{presence}} of GAS is at least 95%, with some studies finding close to 100% specificity. Therefore, if the test result is positive, {{the presence}} of GAS is highly likely. However, 5% to 20% of individuals carry GAS in their throats without symptomatic infection, so the presence of GAS in an individual with pharyngitis does not prove that this organism is responsible for the infection. The sensitivity of lateral flow RSTs is somewhat lower at 65% to 80%. Therefore, a negative result from such a test cannot be used to rule out GAS pharyngitis, a considerable disadvantage compared with microbial culture, which has a sensitivity of 90% to 95%. However, newer optical immunoassay RSTs have been found to have a much higher sensitivity of 94%.|$|E

5|$|Two {{chains of}} DNA twist {{around each other}} to form a DNA double helix with the phosphate-sugar {{backbone}} spiralling around the outside, and the bases pointing inwards with adenine base pairing to thymine and guanine to cytosine. <b>The</b> <b>specificity</b> of base pairing occurs because adenine and thymine align to form two hydrogen bonds, whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands in a double helix must therefore be complementary, with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand, and so on.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{psychiatrist}} Kurt Schneider listed {{the forms of}} psychotic symptoms that he thought distinguished schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders. These are called first-rank symptoms or Schneider's first-rank symptoms. They include delusions of being controlled by an external force, the belief that thoughts are being inserted into or withdrawn from one's conscious mind, the belief that one's thoughts are being broadcast to other people, and hearing hallucinatory voices that comment on one's thoughts or actions or that {{have a conversation with}} other hallucinated voices. Although they have significantly contributed to the current diagnostic criteria, <b>the</b> <b>specificity</b> of first-rank symptoms has been questioned. A review of the diagnostic studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that they allow neither a reconfirmation nor a rejection of Schneider's claims, and suggested that first-rank symptoms should be de-emphasized in future revisions of diagnostic systems. The absence of first-rank symptoms should raise suspicion of a medical disorder, however.|$|E

Previously, <b>the</b> substrate <b>specificity</b> of <b>the</b> P 2 site was studied for the same representative set of retroviral proteases, which included at least one member {{from each of the}} seven genera of the family Retroviridae (P. Bagossi, T. Sperka, A. Fehér, J. Kádas, G. Zahuczky, G. Miklóssy, P. Boross, and J. Tözsér, J. Virol. 79 : 4213 - 4218, 2005). Our enzyme set comprised the proteases of HIV- 1, HIV- 2, equine infectious anemia virus, avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV), Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), Moloney murine leukemia virus, human T-lymphotropic virus type 1, bovine leukemia virus, walleye dermal sarcoma virus, and human foamy virus. Molecular models were used to interpret the similarities and differences in specificity between these retroviral proteases. The results showed that the retroviral proteases had similar preferences (Phe and Tyr) for the P 1 position in this sequence context, but differences were found for the P 3 and P 4 positions. Importantly, the sizes of the P 3 and P 4 residues appear to be a major contributor for <b>specificity.</b> <b>The</b> substrate <b>specificities</b> correlated well with the phylogenetic tree of the retroviruses. Furthermore, while <b>the</b> <b>specificities</b> of some enzymes belonging to different genera appeared to be very similar (e. g., those of AMV and MMTV), <b>the</b> <b>specificities</b> of <b>the</b> primate lentiviral proteases substantially differed from that observed for a nonprimate lentiviral protease...|$|R
