5|$|The town {{continued}} to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, Western Experiment. During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats. By the 19th century, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>building</b> ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe. In 1794, the town's first courthouse was built; it was a wooden structure on Market Square. In 1797, the manufacture of glass began.|$|E
5|$|With {{the plans}} for I-70 extended, a transcontinental route would again be {{attempted}} across the San Rafael Swell. The area west of Green River was so remote that survey crews followed wild horses with jeeps to survey parts of the route. According to a story told at the highway's dedication, by an engineer who surveyed the highway, his group was approached by a sheep rancher and asked what they were doing. The rancher fell over laughing when he was told <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>building</b> a freeway.|$|E
5|$|Bruce McLaren Motor Racing {{was founded}} in 1963; Bruce McLaren was a factory driver for the Cooper motor racing team which competed in Formula One, {{the highest level of}} {{international}} single-seater competition. For two years the McLaren team had raced in the Tasman Series, a competition for single-seaters that ran during the Formula One world championship off-season, and in various sports car races. Bruce McLaren continued to race in Grands Prix (i.e. Formula One championship races) for Cooper, but by 1965 the team's performances were worsening and so he decided to build his own Formula One car to race the following year. Despite being a skilled engineer himself, McLaren enlisted Robin Herd to design the car. Herd was an aerospace engineer who had previously worked at the National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE) where he had been involved with the Concorde project. In September 1965 the M2A development car was completed. Powered by a 4.5 litre Oldsmobile V8 engine, it was used to test Herd's design ideas and Firestone's tyres. With McLaren still employed by Cooper, the McLaren team initially denied that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>building</b> a Formula One competitor, claiming that the M2A was purely a tyre test bed.|$|E

25|$|Another Scottish {{immigrant}} family, the Dickson family, came to Canada and the U.S. in the 1830s. By 1852, {{they had}} organized a small machine shop and foundry (Dickson & Company) in Scranton, Pennsylvania. In 1856 Thomas Dickson became its president, and in 1862 the firm incorporated as the Dickson Manufacturing Company. By 1900 <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>building</b> boilers, steam engines, locomotives, internal combustion engines, blowers, and air compressors.|$|E

The Arab Chronicles, the history of that age, show that Arab awareness of the Franks as a growing military power came only after the Battle of Tours when the Caliph expressed shock at his army's catastrophic defeat.|$|E

25|$|North Carolina was {{inhabited}} {{for thousands}} of years by succeeding cultures of prehistoric indigenous cultures. Before 200 AD, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>building</b> earthwork mounds, which were used for ceremonial and religious purposes. Succeeding peoples, including those of the ancient Mississippian culture established by 1000 AD in the Piedmont, continued to build or add on to such mounds. In the 500–700 years preceding European contact, the Mississippian culture built large, complex cities and maintained far-flung regional trading networks. Its largest city was Cahokia, located in present-day Illinois near the Mississippi River.|$|E

25|$|Having its {{own body}} shop, Daimler had the {{woodworking}} {{ability to build}} complete aircraft. By the end of 1914, they had built 100 units of the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c. These were followed by the BE12 and RE8. Daimler purchased an open field beside their Radford factory, cleared the site, and made it available to the Government, who turned it into the main RAF testing ground for aircraft built in the Coventry district. Although Daimler tooled up for production of the Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.4 bomber the aircraft was cancelled due to poor performance. The last wartime aircraft produced was the Airco DH.10 bomber when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>building</b> 80 aeroplanes a month.|$|E

California's Great America also announced Invertigo will be going to a new home in a different Cedar Fair park. Invertigo was removed and moved into storage in Allentown, Pennsylvania. While in storage, the track received a new teal paint scheme, with the supports remaining in royal blue. On August 30, 2011, Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom {{announced that}} they would be opening Stinger for the park's 2012 season. In November 2011, Dorney Park had completed construction for the coaster and in December <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>building</b> the station and queue.

It was later shown that the number of Soviet missiles did not reach the hundreds until the late 1960s, and at the time they had only four.|$|E
500|$|A small {{population}} of Basketmakers {{remained in the}} Chaco Canyon area. The broad arc of their cultural elaboration culminated around 800, during the Pueblo I Era, when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>building</b> crescent-shaped stone complexes, each comprising four to five residential suites abutting subterranean kivas, large enclosed areas reserved for rites. Such structures characterize the Early Pueblo People. By 850, the Ancient Pueblo population—the [...] "Anasazi", from a Ute term adopted by the Navajo denoting the [...] "ancient ones" [...] or [...] "enemy ancestors"—had rapidly expanded: groups resided in larger, more densely populated pueblos. Strong evidence attests to a canyon-wide turquoise processing and trading industry dating from the 10th century. Around then, {{the first section of}} Pueblo Bonito was built: a curved row of 50 rooms near its present north wall.|$|E

Hiromasa Shikata and Shiro Mouri were two of the three members working on the new game. During this early phase, they had not considered developing a sequel to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past; instead <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>building</b> a game around the theme of [...] "communication". Around six months into the project, they presented their concept for the game to series creator Shigeru Miyamoto. It was poorly received, with Miyamoto calling the idea outdated.

It arrived in Philadelphia in August 1752. Norris wrote to Charles that the bell was in good order, but they had not yet sounded it, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>building</b> a clock for the State House's tower. The bell was mounted on a stand to test the sound, and at the first strike of the clapper, the bell's rim cracked. The episode {{would be used to}} good account in later stories of the bell; in 1893, former President Benjamin Harrison, speaking as the bell passed through Indianapolis, stated, [...] "This old bell was made in England, but it had to be re-cast in America before it was attuned to proclaim the right of self-government and the equal rights of men."
