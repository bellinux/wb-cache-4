40|$|ABSTRACT: Distance {{learning}} service {{has become a}} more and more popular medium {{for the public to}} obtain knowledge. Through advances of broadband network and video compression technologies, conventional products in the distance-learning category can provide a real-time streaming broadcast of live contents or an on-demand streaming of archive contents. However, due to the low resolution of a video camera, images of the projected high-resolution computer screen in the video are usually blurred. This makes it difficult for remote participants to recognize most of the characters in the instructor’s operations only by looking at the video. Therefore, real-time <b>screen</b> <b>recording</b> is proposed to record full motions on the computer screen for learning-supporting materials. Using conventional <b>screen</b> <b>recording</b> system, an instructor may find it difficult to operate application programs smoothly. This {{is due to the fact}} that most of CPU utilization is taken up by the <b>screen</b> <b>recording</b> routines. In this paper, we propose an effective application control, called "sporadic control (SC) " mechanism, to regulate the frequency of <b>screen</b> <b>recording</b> routines to protect the system and network from instantaneous heavy workload. From the experimental results, we show that the CPU utilization can be reduced by more than 15 %. This improvement is significant...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the outcome of}} fulguration of Hunner’s ulcers (HUs) in painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC) that is refractory to conservative treatment. Materials and Methods: Patients diagnosed with refractory PBS/IC and treated with fulguration between 2011 and 2013 were identified <b>through</b> <b>screening</b> of medical <b>records.</b> To evaluate treatment outcomes, voiding diaries, the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, and two IC symptom questionnaires (pelvic pain and urgency/frequency scale [PUF] and O’Leary-Sant IC symptom index and IC problem index [OS]) were used. Fulguration was deemed to be successful if the VAS score was ＜ 2 or {{less than half of}} the preoperative VAS score. Results: In total, 27 patients with PBS/IC in whom conservative treatments had failed were enrolled. Two months after fulguration, decreases were observed in the mean 24 -hour urinary frequency (from 16. 0 to 10. 2), 24 -hour urgency episodes (8. 0 to 1. 8), and the VAS (5. 8 to 1. 2), PUF symptom (15. 1 to 7. 0), PUF bother (8. 4 to 2. 7), OS symptom (15. 1 to 7. 2), and OS problem (13. 8 to 6. 0) scores. At 5 and 10 months, all variables had worsened. At 2, 5, and 10 months, the success rates were 94. 1 %, 70. 0 %, and 33. 3 %, respectively. Four patients underwent one repeat fulguration on average 11. 3 months after the first fulguration. Repeat fulguration was not significantly associated with any clinical characteristics. Conclusions: In PBS/IC that was refractory to medication or other conservative treat-ments, HU elimination by fulguration effectively improved symptoms. However, this effect decreased gradually over time...|$|R
