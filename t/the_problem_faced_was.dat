40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project was to seek greater understanding of how competence development processes may be developed through in-house workplace networks. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>faced</b> <b>was</b> that within the realms of competence development in networks there was an abundance of information both scientific and general regarding interactive, internet based social networks as learning communities. However scientific knowledge regarding competence development processes within in-house workplace networks seemed {{few and far between}} resulting in a knowledge gap. A hermeneutic approach was thus followed with aim to seek answers to the question “what are the experienced conditions of in-house networks (limitations and support) with regards to worker competence development processes”? Empirical findings revealed that processes surrounding the in-house network structure, organisational aims effecting the networks, social participation and individual inner processes were all experienced as conditions of in-house networks. Interpretation concluded that involvement, practice and reflection processes which are structured into in-house networks encourage competence development on individual, group and organisation levels...|$|E
30|$|PAN–CNT (1 – 3  wt%) 9  % {{solutions}} {{were prepared}} in following steps: at first 0.01  g functionalized CNTs were dispersed in N,N-dimethylformamide. The mixture {{was kept in}} sonicator for 5 – 8  h to break bundles of CNTs and magnetic stirring to disperse well CNTs in DMF. A good dispersion was achieved in 7  h. Calculated quantity of PAN copolymer chopped microfibers were added in dispersion solution and kept on magnetic stirrer for overnight to mix well the polymer in CNT dispersion. Solution was sonicated for 1  h and then electrospun with ESPIN instrument at voltage 15  kV, flow rate 0.2  ml/h, drum speed 2000  rpm, distance 15  cm to produce PAN–CNT composite nanofibers. It was difficult to prepare solution using higher concentration of CNT. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>faced</b> <b>was</b> that, in high quantity of CNTs polymer not get dispersed well and form a solid mass. So both CNTs and polymer were dispersed in DMF separately. CNTs and DMF mixture was sonicated for 1  h till all bundles breakup and then kept on magnetic stirrer, good dispersion observed in sun light. Polymer was soaked in DMF well and sonicated for 1  h. Then it was kept on magnetic stirrer till a clear solution was obtained. Same procedure was carried out for PAN–CNT concentrations (2 – 3  wt%).|$|E
