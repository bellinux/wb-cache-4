25|$|Genetic change {{occurs in}} a {{population}} when natural selection and mutations act on its genetic variability.

Genetic changes may result in visible structures, or may adjust physiological activity in a way <b>that</b> <b>suits</b> the habitat.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{algorithm}} {{is also used}} to define the notion of decidability. That notion is central for explaining how formal systems come into being starting from a small set of axioms and rules. In logic, the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured, as it is not apparently related with our customary physical dimension. From such uncertainties, that characterize ongoing work, stems the unavailability of a definition of algorithm <b>that</b> <b>suits</b> both concrete (in some sense) and abstract usage of the term.|$|E

25|$|No Man's Sky is {{primarily}} {{designed as a}} single-player game, though discoveries can be shared to all players via the Steam Workshop, and friends can track {{each other on the}} game's galactic map. Hello Games' Sean Murray stated that one might spend about forty hours of gametime to reach the centre of the galaxy if they did not perform any side activities, but he also fully anticipated that players would play the game in a manner <b>that</b> <b>suits</b> them, such as having those that might try to catalogue the flora and fauna in the universe, while others may attempt to set up trade routes between planets. Players can track friends on the galactic map and the system maps. Due to limited multiplayer aspects, Sony does not require PlayStation 4 users to have a PlayStation Plus subscription to play the game online.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{schools are}} divided into three types - gymnasiums, {{professional}} and craft schools. After graduating from the primary school, students take a test called Matura. The test covers subjects that were taught in primary school. They are awarded the maximum of 40 points at the test. They also get points from their average marks from 5th to 8th grade, and the maximum is 60 points. Both the points from Matura and from average marks are totallized into the maximum of 100 points. Then, students {{make a list of}} their preferred schools and are sorted according to how much points they had gained - every secondary school has a limited number of students it takes. After students make lists for preferred schools, they get into the first school <b>that</b> <b>suits</b> them according to the points. If they fail to get into any of the schools they had listed (ex. if they don't have enough points, but they had chosen very competitive schools), they make another list for the Second Enrollment Deadline.|$|E

25|$|Identity {{development}} is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are, adolescents are liklely to cycle {{through a number of}} identities to find one <b>that</b> <b>suits</b> them best. Developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood. Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The years of adolescence create a more conscientious group of young adults. Adolescents pay close attention and give more time and effort to their appearance as their body goes through changes. Unlike children, teens put forth an effort to look presentable (1991). The environment in which an adolescent grows up also {{plays an important role in}} their identity development. Studies done by the American Psychological Association have shown that adolescents with a less privileged upbringing have a more difficult time developing their identity.|$|E

500|$|Arens' third primary {{argument}} is that ever since {{the development of the}} discipline, the anthropological community have continually perpetuated the [...] "Man-Eating Myth" [...] that cultural cannibalism was widespread across the world. In this way, he sees anthropologists as following in the path of Christian friars from the Early Modern period who asserted the existence of cannibalism [...] "beyond the pale of civilization", in societies that are either historically or geographically distinct to western culture. He furthermore argues that both Christian proselytizers and academic anthropologists have sought to accuse non-western, non-Christian peoples of cultural cannibalism in order to then explain and rationalize their [...] "savage" [...] ways; in doing so, he argues, they continue to portray the Christian west as a civilizing influence on the world <b>that</b> <b>suits</b> their own socio-political agendas. In this way, Arens feels that the [...] "Man-Eating Myth" [...] furthers the [...] "we-they" [...] dichotomy between westerners and non-westerners, and has indirectly lent some justification for the western exploitation of [...] "savage" [...] non-western peoples.|$|E
