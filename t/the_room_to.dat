5|$|After the Rainmen {{reached the}} site of the game hours early and began warming up, they were {{discovered}} by Express assistant coach Gerry Brumpton. Windsor head coach Bill Jones later entered <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> retrieve a ball and violence erupted between him and Halifax center Liam McMorrow. This sparked a brawl between both the teams as a whole, causing police to arrive. The Rainmen eventually left the stadium and chose to not compete in Game 7 because of safety concerns.|$|E
5|$|By October 1760, George II {{was blind}} in one eye, and hard of hearing. On {{the morning of}} 25 October, he rose as usual at 6:00am, drank {{a cup of hot}} chocolate, and went to his close stool, alone. After a few minutes, his valet heard a loud crash. He entered <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> find the king on the floor. The king was lifted into his bed, and Princess Amelia was sent for, but before she reached him, he was dead. At the age of nearly 77, he had lived longer than any of his English or British predecessors. A {{post-mortem}} revealed that the right ventricle of the king's heart had ruptured as the result of an incipient aortic aneurysm.|$|E
5|$|In 1780, {{the society}} moved again, {{this time to}} Somerset House. The {{property}} was offered to the society by His Majesty's Government and, as soon as Sir Joseph Banks became president in November 1778, he began planning the move. Somerset House, while larger than Crane Court, was not satisfying to the fellows; <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> store the library was too small, the accommodation was insufficient {{and there was not}} enough room to store the museum at all. As a result, the museum was handed to the British Museum in 1781 and the library was extended to two rooms, one of which was used for council meetings.|$|E
5|$|John Clark Udall oversaw {{construction}} of the north wing in 1907, increasing <b>the</b> number of <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> 150. In 1909, Udall oversaw a 72-room seven-story west wing, further increasing <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> 221.|$|R

50|$|The {{rear wing}} is a modest {{structure}} in Flemish bond brickwork, with timber windows and louvred French doors opening onto a verandah to the east. The building {{has been extended}} and modified to the north east, north west and west. It consists of a kitchen, several bedrooms and an office, also accessed from a central corridor. The corridor and <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west have flagstone floors, while <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east have timber floors. <b>The</b> western <b>rooms</b> have been extensively refurbished, while <b>the</b> eastern <b>rooms</b> retain their timber boarded and pressed metal ceilings.|$|R
5|$|In 1823 Helm {{called on}} Representative Benjamin Hardin. While Hardin and Helm {{discussed}} business, Hardin's 14-year-old daughter, Lucinda, entered <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> show her father a map she had drawn. Helm later {{claimed it was}} love at first sight, and began to pursue Lucinda's affections. They courted for seven years, married in 1830 and had six daughters and five sons together. One of his sons, Benjamin Hardin Helm, was a Confederate general in the Civil War and was killed at the Battle of Chickamauga.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to other rooms within the castle, Lord Bute's Bedroom, sited above the Winch Room, {{is relatively small}} and simple. The original plan had Bute's personal accommodation in the Keep but {{the expansion of the}} Drawing Room to a double-height room in 1879 required a late change of plan. The bedroom contains an ornately carved fireplace. Doors lead off <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> an internal balcony overlooking the courtyard and to the bretache over the gate arch. The furniture is mainly by Chapple and post-dates Burges, although the washstand and dressing table are pared-down versions of two pieces – the Narcissus Washstand and the Crocker Dressing Table – that Burges made for his own home in London, The Tower House.|$|E
5|$|In {{the distant}} future, deadly solar flares force {{humanity}} to evacuate Earth on giant, nationalistic colony ships. The Doctor and Amy arrive on Starship UK, {{one of the}} last ships to leave and holding the population of the United Kingdom. Amy tends to a crying young girl ignored by adults while the Doctor, curious to the ship's engines, seeks the control room. He finds <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> be a false front, and encounters Liz 10, who seems to know him.|$|E

5|$|Mulder {{waits in}} the hotel bar while Scully guards Judy in a hotel room. The assassin enters <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> attack them but is quickly killed by Skinner, who was also there. The dead man's {{identity}} is unknown. Skinner returns to work, declining to say to Mulder how he knew them {{to be at the}} hotel. After Mulder leaves, he reaches into his drawer and puts his wedding ring back on.|$|E
5|$|The {{austerity}} and the passivity of {{the first}} character is, however, contrasted vividly with the passion and activity of the second character. Madonna in this portrayal wears a red voluminous extravagant Spanish style dress, which shows off her décolletage, with a middle parting in the skirt, while wearing red carnations in her hair. Complementing this passionate look, the second setting features a bright red room with red candles and candelabra. While the spiritual and pious Madonna shyly watches the Latinos and prays silently in her room, the passionate Madonna dances and leaves <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> join the dancers in the streets.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} hall was flanked {{on either side}} by similarly sized rooms probably accessible from the central courtyard. The one on the west contained washing facilities and a gutter leading to a soak-away in {{the central part of}} the building, <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> the east may possibly have been a guardroom. On the western side of the courtyard were three small rooms which opened out onto the central colonnade at ground level. The function of these rooms is uncertain, but they were probably used as private accommodation for users of the mansio. The largest room in the mansio lay in the north-east corner, the chamber was heated by a channelled hypocaust system added some time after the building was first completed.|$|E
50|$|The oldest part of {{the house}} is the central chimney and <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> {{immediately}} <b>to</b> its right; <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chimney's left were built next (probably not long afterward), and the leanto section (which faces the street today) was added {{in the middle of the}} 18th century. In 1906 a barn was attached to the north side of the house and converted to living space.|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} {{entrance to}} the cell in the center along the east wall, the door was replaced with a modern door {{at the time of}} nomination. Inside, a winding staircase leads to the attic. To the north is the kitchen, retaining a hewn summer beam and flared cased posts while sporting modern cabinets and wallpaper. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> the south also has a visible hewn summer beam and its original casing on the flared posts. The attic is finished with vertically placed beaded boarding, and the roof is framed with hewn rafters.|$|E
5|$|Henri Christophe's {{widow and}} {{children}} are taken to Europe by English merchants, who used to supply the royal family. Solimán accompanies them and enjoys the summers in Rome, where he is treated well and tells embellished tales of his past. He encounters a statue of Pauline whose form brings back memories, and sends him into a howl, causing <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> be rushed. He is reminded of the night of Henri Christophe's demise and flees before succumbing to malaria. Ti Noel recalls things told by Macandal, and the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy has become a happy place, with Ti Noel presiding over celebrations and festivities. Surveyors disrupt the peace at the plantation, and mulattoes have risen to power; they force hundreds of black prisoners to work by whiplash, and many have lost hope as the cycle of slavery continues. Ti Noel, thinking of Macandal, decides to transform into various animals to observe the ongoing events; he metamorphoses into a bird, a stallion, a wasp, and then an ant. He eventually becomes a goose, but is rejected by the clan of geese. He understands that being a goose {{does not imply that}} all geese are equal, so he returns to human form. The book concludes with the end of Ti Noel's life, and his own self-reflection upon greatness and The Kingdom of This World.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> {{the east}} of the Oak Bedroom is known as The Great Room. The room was {{established}} in the mid 17th century as part of a reception suite, and was used by George John, the Second Earl for important political conferences during his period as First Lord of the Admiralty and Home Secretary. The Great Room, predominantly red and gold in design like many of the first floor rooms, contains a table and chairs with a large gilded mirror with three urns in front of it. The long mirror, designed by James Stuart, who was noted for his Athenian designs, features a tableaux at the top with the Spencer coat of arms and the pulling of chariots by cherubs, representing the love between John and Georgiana. The Great Room contains an extensive collection of miniature portraits, including a very rare Lucas de Heere portrait of Lady Jane Grey as a teenage girl at her family residence in Bradgate, Leicestershire. The Portrait of Isaak Abrahamsz. Massa is mentioned in the 1822 Bibliotheca Spenceriana as hanging in one of the bedrooms at Althorp. It was sold in 1924 to art merchant Joseph Duveen, who sold it the following year to Canadian businessman Frank P. Wood.|$|E

50|$|The Benjamin Coker House is a {{historic}} First Period house at 172 State Street in Newburyport, Massachusetts. The oldest portion of the house, the central chimney and <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> its left, were built c. 1700 on a site {{at the corner of}} High and Federal Streets. The building was widened in the mid 18th century, adding <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right. The building was moved to its present location in 1856, and enlarged with a two story addition on the rear. It underwent a major rehabilitation in 1989, but retains some mid 18th century decorative details.|$|R

5|$|While waiting, {{he hears}} an {{explosion}} nearby, and leaves <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> investigate. He finds two men trapped by fallen components in a fire-engulfed room. Wesley helps to release one man wounded under a heavy pipe, {{and tries to}} coax the other man to leave the burning room, but the man refuses. Wesley is forced to leave the scared man inside and drags the other man to safety. Outside the room, he soon realizes this was the psychological test. Eventually, the cadets are told of the results, and Mordock is granted admission into Starfleet Academy, while Wesley is encouraged to try again next year. Mordock thanks Wesley for his help and wishes him future success. After Wesley returns to the Enterprise, Picard confides in him that he also failed the examination the first time.|$|E
5|$|With the {{characters}} {{spread out across}} the world, a friend suggested that Martin divide the story geographically into two volumes, of which A Feast for Crows would be the first. This approach would give Martin <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> complete his commenced story arcs as he had originally intended, which he still felt was the best approach years later. Martin moved the unfinished characters' stories set in the east (Essos) and north (Winterfell and the Wall) into the next book, A Dance with Dragons, and left A Feast for Crows to cover the events on Westeros, King's Landing, the Riverlands, Dorne, and the Iron Islands. Both books begin immediately {{after the end of}} A Storm of Swords, running in parallel instead of sequentially, and involve different casts of characters with only little overlap. Martin split Arya's chapters into both books after having already moved the three other most popular characters (Jon Snow, Tyrion, and Daenerys) into A Dance with Dragons.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} three {{soldiers}} entered, a fire started and travelled up the curtains {{and out of the}} second-floor window, severely burning the staff sergeant. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and he fell to the balcony below before entering the embassy behind the rest of his team. Slightly behind Red Team, Blue Team detonated explosives on a first-floor window, forcing Sim Harris, who had just run into <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>to</b> take cover. Much of the operation {{at the front of the}} embassy took place in full view of the assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, thus Harris's escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video. As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS men. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through the back door and cleared the ground floor and cellar. The SAS then began evacuating hostages, manhandling them down the stairs towards the back door of the embassy. Two of the terrorists were hiding amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for fear of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to the bottom of the stairs, where two other soldiers shot him dead.|$|E

50|$|Toward the {{beginning}} of the 18th Century, a pattern emerged where the ladies of the house would withdraw after dinner from <b>the</b> dining <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drawing <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> gentlemen would remain in <b>the</b> dining <b>room</b> having drinks. <b>The</b> dining <b>room</b> tended <b>to</b> take on a more masculine tenor as a result.|$|R

5|$|Upstairs in the house, Kung Fu and Prof find Gorgeous {{wearing a}} bridal gown, who then reveals her aunt's diary to them. Kung Fu follows Gorgeous as {{she leaves the}} room, only to find Sweet's body trapped in a {{grandfather}} clock. Panic-driven, the remaining girls barricade {{the upper part of}} the house while Prof, Fantasy and Kung Fu read the aunt's diary. They are interrupted by the giant-sized head of Gorgeous. Gorgeous reveals that her aunt died many years ago waiting for her fiancée to return from World War II and that her spirit remains, eating unmarried girls who arrive at her home. The three girls are then attacked by household items. Prof shouts to Kung Fu to attack the aunt's cat, Blanche. As Kung Fu lunges into a flying kick, she is eaten by a possessed light fixture. Kung Fu's legs manage to escape and attack the painting of Blanche on the wall. The attacked Blanche portrait spurts blood, causing <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> flood. Prof tries to read the diary to solve the problem, but is pulled under the blood by a monster jar. Fantasy sees Gorgeous in the bridal gown and paddles towards her. Gorgeous appears as her aunt in the reflection in the blood and then cradles Fantasy. In the morning, Ryoko arrives at the house and finds Gorgeous in a classic kimono. Gorgeous tells Ryoko that her friends will wake up soon and that they will be hungry. She then shakes hands with Ryoko and burns her away to nothing.|$|E
5|$|Whitney discovers she is {{pregnant}} by Lee, but all her hints {{and attempts to}} tell him fail. Linda realises and is ecstatic when Whitney confirms it. Linda tells Mick, and when Whitney tells Lee, Mick and Linda rush into <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> celebrate before {{he has a chance}} to let the news sink in. Whitney and Lee are both diagnosed with chlamydia and Whitney blames herself due to Rob. Abi admits to Whitney she had a one-night stand and gave Lee chlamydia. Whitney initially ends their relationship and considers leaving Walford, but later decides to give him another chance. Whitney is pleased when Ryan is released from prison and he tells her he is moving to Wakefield. He offers Whitney and Lee to move in with him and she accepts, but later declines when Linda strongly disapproves of them moving so far away. Whitney and Ryan share an emotional farewell. Whitney suffers spotting and is taken to hospital with Lee, Linda and Mick, where the bleeeding gets heavier. A scan shows Whitney has miscarried her baby, devastating her and Lee. Lauren encourages Whitney to find out whether she lost their baby due to him giving her chlamydia and she confides in Johnny (now Ted Reilly) that chlamydia might have caused it but tells Lee that the doctors said it could not have. Whitney decides to go Milton Keynes to stay with Bianca but returns the next day with Bianca's wedding dress and intends to get married. She reassures everyone she is fine and is thrown another hen party. Whitney marries Lee with Stacey acting as maid of honour in place of an ill Lauren and Tiffany and Lily as bridesmaids. Whitney is disappointed to learn that Lee was behind the robbery at The Vic but is unaware how close to suicide he was. She argues with Lee over money and Danny Mitchell (Liam Bergin) who tries to kiss her. Whitney then turns to Mick for support, and sleeps at The Vic. The next day she is reconciled with an apologetic Lee but finds his wage slip showing how little he earns. Following another argument with Lee, Whitney confides in Mick, telling him she is going to buy Ryan an engagement present. Later, a bus crashes into the market and Whitney is trapped underneath it. Whitney is rescued and in hospital, she talks to Mick about her marriage. He comforts her and she kisses him, which is seen by Denise Fox (Diane Parish). Whitney decides to organise a night out and pawns her wedding ring for cash. Lee discovers what she has done and they start arguing. When Whitney says he doesn't deserve her, Lee slaps her in the face. Shortly after the incident Whitney lays on the bed in silence, with Lee begging for forgiveness. Whitney confides in Lauren who strongly advises her to leave Lee.|$|E

50|$|Recording {{studios are}} {{carefully}} designed around <b>the</b> principles of <b>room</b> acoustics <b>to</b> create {{a set of}} spaces with the acoustical properties required for recording sound with precision and accuracy. This will consist of both <b>room</b> treatment (through <b>the</b> use of absorption and diffusion materials on the surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and also consideration of the physical dimensions of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> itself in order <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> <b>room</b> respond <b>to</b> sound in a desired way) and soundproofing (also to provide sonic isolation between <b>the</b> <b>rooms)</b> <b>to</b> prevent sound from leaving the property. A recording studio has to be soundproofed on its outer shell as well, to prevent noises from the surrounding streets and roads from being picked up by microphones.|$|R
