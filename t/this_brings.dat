5|$|The North Atlantic {{oscillation}} is an atmospheric phenomenon {{affecting the}} weather in Western Europe. When the atmospheric pressure variations in the North Atlantic are large, the springs in Europe are warmer. <b>This</b> <b>brings</b> forward the northward migration of those bird species (including the goldcrest) that winter mainly within western or southern Europe. A general climatic change resulting in more frequent positive North Atlantic oscillation events has led to earlier spring migration of these short-distance migrants since the 1980s. The warmer spring weather brings on plant growth, thus preparing the habitat for returning migrants. The effect is greatest in western and central Europe.|$|E
5|$|As {{they travel}} across the war-torn land, they are confronted by avatars {{in the service}} of {{multiple}} nations, and Arca - a cult made up of avatars led by a woman known as Mathias. Chitose joins Arca to further their cause of a utopia for avatars, and tries to persuade Luca to join, causing a rift between them. The conflicts between the groups is further inflamed as more people regain their memories as warriors of Sensus or Ratio, sparking old conflicts. In their adventures, the group works to end the fighting and learn about their past lives. When the full truth is revealed, they decide to fulfill Asura's wishes and unite the two worlds. <b>This</b> <b>brings</b> them into conflict with Mathias, who is revealed to be the incarnation of Asura's wrath at being betrayed, and now wishes to destroy both Devaloka and Naraka. Chitose, consumed by Sakuya's love for Asura, helps Mathias in her task. The party confront Mathias and Chitose in Devaloka's ruined capital, where the Manifest is hidden. They defeat Mathias, and Chitose kills herself in a fit of despair. Luca then proceeds to use the Manifest to merge Devaloka and Naraka, nullifying the avatars' powers and lessening the chance of future conflicts. The group then returns to their normal lives.|$|E
5|$|Calakmul {{is one of}} {{the most}} structure-rich sites within the Maya region. The site {{contains}} 117 stelae, the largest total in the region. Most are in paired sets representing rulers and their wives. However, because these carved stelae were produced in soft limestone, most of these stelae have been eroded beyond interpretation. Also many elaborate murals were discovered at Calakmul. These murals do not represent activities of the elite class. Rather, they depict elaborate market scenes of people preparing or consuming products such as atole, tamales, or tobacco as an ointment. Also items being sold were textiles and needles. These murals also have glyphs within them describing the actions occurring. The most prominent figure in these murals is identified as Lady Nine Stone; she appears in many scenes. <b>This</b> <b>brings</b> a world of the Maya marketplace to vibrant life for archaeologists. Another highly beneficial resource to Maya archaeological understanding at Calakmul is the ceramic remains. The composition of the ceramic materials identifies the region or more specifically the polity that produced them. Ceramics with the snake emblem glyph found at several sites also give more evidence to identify ties or control over that site by Calakmul.|$|E

5|$|The highway heads southeast, partly {{along the}} latter creek, past Keddie to Quincy in the American Valley. It leaves the valley via Greenhorn Creek, passing the Feather River Route's Williams Loop and then {{following}} the small Estray Creek to Lee Summit, which the rail line passes under in the Spring Garden Tunnel. <b>This</b> <b>brings</b> SR 70 {{into the valley}} of the Middle Fork Feather River, which takes it southeast to Blairsden, where the State Scenic Highway ends and State Route 89 splits to the south, and then east, through the Plumas National Forest, to Portola and Beckwourth. The large Sierra Valley begins at the latter community, and SR 70 heads almost directly across, passing the north end of SR 49 at Vinton and the south end of SR 284 at Chilcoot before crossing Beckwourth Pass, which the railroad takes the Chilcoot Tunnel under, and descending slightly to end at U.S. 395 at Hallelujah Junction.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>brings</b> {{the issue}} of the mysterious origin of the Wielbark culture, and why it so {{immediately}} replaced the Oksywie culture. According to the legend quoted in The Origin and Deeds of the Goths by the 6th century Gothic historian Jordanes, the ancestors of that Germanic tribe arrived from Scandinavia (under King Berig) in two boatloads and landed on the South Baltic shores, followed by a third boat carrying the ancestors of the Gepids. Supposedly they conquered the native people of that region, and then, some years later (under King Filimer, the fifth one counting from Berig), continued their migration toward the Black Sea. This story, in the past dismissed, is now seen as containing basic elements of the true sequence of events and the Wielbark culture is in part identified with Germanic ancestors of the Goths indeed. The idea of an arrival in the mouth of the Vistula region of culturally different (although related) people, who mixed with the Oksywie culture population, and being more advanced possibly dominated it (at least culturally) to some degree, is not at odds with the state of archeological findings and may explain the change of cultures in Pomerania around 30 AD.|$|E

5|$|In modern medicine, {{around a}} quarter of the drugs {{prescribed}} to patients are derived from medicinal plants, and they are rigorously tested. In other systems of medicine, medicinal plants may constitute the majority of what are often informal attempted treatments, not tested scientifically. Medicinal plant use ranges from the mainstream, where some of the drugs used are derived from plants, to traditional medicine where plants form the bulk of the substances administered. The World Health Organization estimates, without reliable data, that some 80 percent of the world's population depends mainly on traditional medicine (including but not limited to plants); perhaps some two billion people are largely reliant on medicinal plants. The use of plant-based materials including herbal remedies and so-called nutraceuticals, foods with supposed health benefits, is increasing quickly in developed countries. <b>This</b> <b>brings</b> attendant risks of toxicity and other effects on human health, despite the safe image of herbal remedies. Herbal medicines have been in use since long before modern medicine existed; there was and often still is little or no knowledge of the pharmacological basis of their actions, if any, or of their safety. The World Health Organization formulated a policy on traditional medicine in 1991, and since then has published guidelines for them, with a series of monographs on widely used herbal medicines.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Buenos Aires is {{dominated}} by the semi–permanent South Atlantic High throughout the year. <b>This</b> <b>brings</b> in moist winds from the northeast, which brings most of the precipitation to the city. During winter, it brings in frontal systems responsible for precipitation in the city. In autumn and summer, it produces storms that are generally located north of the city and produces strong winds from the south or southeast that can occasionally lead to the swelling of the Río de la Plata, flooding coastal areas. The South Pacific High is the origin of polar air masses that are responsible for the coldest temperatures and result in clear and very dry conditions. These air masses originate from the South Pacific high and move in a northeastern direction during winter towards Buenos Aires by passing. Although it is polar maritime (this is a cool, moist air mass that forms from oceans located in the subarctic and arctic regions at the southern tip of South America), it becomes modified as it passes over the South American continent, becoming drier as it arrives at Buenos Aires. This is because as the cold air masses from the South Pacific High move over the Pacific Ocean and the Andes and reach the land south of 35oS (where the Andes are shorter in height), anticyclogenesis leads to the formation of a strong high pressure system {{in the center of the}} country (at around 40oS). This high pressure system brings cold and dry, polar continental air masses to Buenos Aires. Cold fronts are more common during winter than in summer as the South Atlantic and South Pacific highs are at their southernmost positions during summer, making it difficult for cold fronts to enter.|$|E
