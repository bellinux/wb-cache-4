40|$|The marble area in Ma On Shan in Hong Kong is {{symbolized by}} highly {{variable}} rockhead contours and deep depressions filled with thick layers of weak {{materials such as}} debris flow deposits. Piling experience in the area shows that very large pile penetration, often larger than 100 m, is needed to obtain required pile capacity. Verticality becomes a concern for such long and slender piles. A <b>trial</b> <b>pile</b> test program consisting of four very long driven steel H-piles, instrumented with inclinometers and strain gauges, {{was carried out in}} Ma On Shan. Pile load tests and verticality monitoring at several penetration depths were carried out to the investigate the pile capacity and performance. In this research, results of verticality monitoring are reported and interpreted with regard to rockhead inclination and special soil conditions. Large lateral pile movements occurred during pile penetration due to sloping rockhead or rock fragments. Both one-side sway and cyclic sway were observed at different penetration depths, leading to loose contact between the soil and the pile shaft. Driveability analysis of long piles by using GRLWEAP is also conducted. The capacity and the load transfer in the very long piles are studied {{based on the results of}} static load tests and dynamic tests, and their relations to the pile verticality are discussed. The small pile capacity found from the static and dynamic pile tests can be explained by the verticality effect, which is related to the formation of a void along the pile shaft due to pile sways during driving and the development of a highly remoulded zone of soil surrounding the pile shaft due to sudden changes of penetration direction. Three common static analysis methods for predicting pile capacity, including the API method, the ICP method and the FHWA method, are evaluated with the results of static load tests. A more reasonable and comparable prediction with the results of static load tests is obtained using the ICP method...|$|E
40|$|Two <b>trial</b> <b>piles</b> were {{installed}} at the berm section of an embankment in the later stage of its construction {{and one of them}} was fitted with an oversized casing to isolate its top 3. m from the action of surrounding soil. Lateral bending behaviour these two piles subjected to passive sub soil movements were very different from each other because of the casing and is modelled in this paper using a three dimensional analysis. The effect of relative stiffness of the piles on their lateral bending behaviour is investigated. The effect of interface joint slip on the pile's behaviour is also investigated in a later section of this paper...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the re-assessment of {{foundation}} settlements for the Burj Khalifa Tower in Dubai. The foundation system for the tower is a piled raft, founded on deep deposits of calcareous rocks. Two computer programs, Geotechnical Analysis of Raft with Piles (GARP) and Non-linear Analysis of Piled Rafts (NAPRA) {{have been used for}} the settlement analyses, and the paper outlines the procedure adopted to re-assess the foundation settlements based on a careful interpretation of load tests on <b>trial</b> <b>piles</b> in which the interaction effects of the pile test set-up are allowed for. The paper then examines the influence of a series of factors on the computed settlements. In order to obtain reasonable estimates of differential settlements within the system, it is found desirable to incorporate the effects of the superstructure stiffness which act to increase the stiffness of the overall foundation system. Values of average and differential settlements for the piled raft calculated with GARP and NAPRA were found to be in reasonable agreement with measured data on settlementstaken near the end of construction of the tower...|$|R

40|$|Vibratory {{driving is}} today {{the most common}} {{installation}} method of sheet piles. The knowledge of the induced ground vibrations is however still deficient. This makes predictions of the vibration magnitudes difficult to carry out with good reliability. To avoid exceeding the limit values, resulting in stops of production, or that vibratory driven sheet piles are discarded for more costly solutions, a need for increased knowledge of the vibration process is imminent. With increased knowledge, a more reliable and practical prediction model can be developed.   The aim of this thesis is to analyze measured data from a field study to increase {{the understanding of the}} induced vibrations and their propagation through the soil. The field study was performed in Karlstad in May 2010, where a <b>trial</b> sheet <b>piling</b> prior to an extension of Karlstad Theatre was carried out. During the <b>trial</b> sheet <b>piling,</b> two triaxial geophones were mounted at the ground surface at two different distances from the sheet piles, to measure the vibration amplitude. The field test is associated with some limitations. Only four sheet piles were driven, with one measurement per sheet pile. Some measurements were less successful and some parameters had to be assumed. This limits the accuracy but still provides some interesting results. Another aim is to compare the measured values to existing models for predicting vibrations from piling and sheet piling operations. There are today several prediction models available, which however often provide too crude estimations or alternatively are too advanced to be incorporated in practical use. Two basic empirical prediction models are compared to the measured values in Karlstad, where the first is one of the earliest and most well known models and the other is a later development of the first model. The purpose of this comparison is to evaluate these models to {{contribute to the development of}} a new prediction model. The results show that the earlier model greatly overestimates the vibration magnitude while the later developed model provides a better estimation.   A literature study is performed to gain a theoretical background to the problem of ground vibrations and how they are related to the method of vibratory driving of sheet piles. The analysis considering the field study and prediction models is mainly performed by using MATLAB to obtain different graphical presentations of the vibration signals. The conclusions that can be drawn from the results are that the focus of vibration analysis should not always be the vertical vibration components. Horizontal movements of the sheet pile might be introduced, e. g. by the configuration of the clamping device, which generates additional vibrations in horizontal directions. The soil characteristics influence the magnitude of the vibrations. As the sheet pile reaches a stiffer soil layer, the vibration magnitude increases. A realistic and reliable prediction model should take the characteristics of the soil into account...|$|R
40|$|Biopulping is the {{treatment}} of wood chips and other lignocellulosic materials with lignin-degrading fungi prior to pulping. Ten years of industry-sponsored research has demonstrated the technical feasibility of the technology for mechanical pulping at a laboratory scale. Two 50 -ton outdoor chip <b>pile</b> <b>trials</b> recently conducted at the USDA Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) in Madison, Wisconsin have established the engineering and economical feasibility of the technology. After refining the control and the fungus-treated chips through a thermomechanical pulp (TMP) mill, the resulting pulps were made into papers on the pilot-scale paper machine at FPL. In addition to the 30 % savings in electrical energy consumption during refining, improvements in {{the strength of the}} resulting paper were seen due to fungal pretreatment. Because of the stronger paper, we were able to substitute at least 5 % kraft pulp in a blend of mechanical and kraft pulps. This recent work has clearly demonstrated that economic benefits can be achieved with biopulping technology through both the energy savings and substitution of the stronger biopulped TMP for more expensive kraft, while maintaining the paper quality...|$|R
40|$|Biopulping, as {{developed}} at Forest Products Laboratory (FPL), involves treating wood chips {{from a common}} pulpwood species with a white-rot fungus prior to pulping. The fungal treatment decreases mechanical pulping energy, significantly increases paper strength properties, and lowers brightness, but has minimal effect on other optical properties. Fifty-ton chip <b>pile</b> <b>trials</b> have shown biopulping to be commercially feasible. Current technology is based on using specialized equipment to steam chips for surface sterilization, inoculating with a lignin-degrading (white-rot) fungus, and aerating the chips during a two-week incubation prior to pulping. In separate studies at FPL and the University of Washington, small-diameter softwood trees from the Colville National Forest, Washington, were found suitable for chemical and mechanical pulping. The small-diameter tree species are {{an alternative to the}} commonly used pulpwood species. Biopulping was not included in that investigation. We biopulped small-diameter softwood and aspen, for comparative purposes, using wild-type isolates of Ceriporiopsis subvermispora and Phanerochaete chrysosporium and a genetically altered strain of Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Results showed that refiner mechanical pulping of lodgepole pine and aspen chips treated with wild-type or genetically modified strains generally saved electrical energy, improved pulp properties, and improved paper strength properties. Genetic manipulation of P. chrysosporium substantially enhanced biopulping performance relative to the parental wild-type strain...|$|R
30|$|Numerous works {{has been}} done by various {{researchers}} in establishing better understanding in this regards. Majano et al. [6] observed higher angle of wall friction when polymer was used as a drilling fluid as compared to bentonite slurries. Ata and Neill [1] through microscopic examination of polymer found that polymers are suitable for most of the soil has squeezes into the pores and attains any shape helping in stabilization of soil, they also mention the process of coiling in which polymers break down due to calcium ions presents in the concrete. Brown [5] quoted that polymer promotes an excellent bond between concrete and soil but Frizzi et al. [7] observed high end bearing resistance of pile when bentonite slurries were used in contrast to polymer slurries. In a similar process Lam et al. [2] through a field <b>trial</b> on three <b>piles</b> in east Landon observed polymer outperformed their counterpart bentonite slurry as the former produce higher load capacity. In recent time, environment protection has evolved {{to be one of the}} major concerns for the world. Thus several restrictions have been imposed on the final disposal of liquid waste. Lam and Jefferis [3] have mentioned that since polymer is used in very small concentration as compared to bentonite, can be broken down easily with oxidizing agents such as hypochlorite (bleach) so that after the colloidal particles settles the supernatant liquid be disposed to sewer and they also mentioned the operational benefits of polymer fluids over bentonite fluid and has mentioned such a site in Glasgow as polymer fluids neither require multiple holding tanks for slurry hydration nor separations to recover the used fluid. Lam et al. [4] explained the phenomenon of soft toes, reducing load carrying capacity of foundation due deposition of soil particles on the bottom of polymer fluid and quoted the necessity of removal of soil particles using suitable construction technique.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop prototypes for estimating the optimal storage time and sorting of fuel wood. Drying trials employing the state of the art technology of load cell based metal frames were carried out by University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU), METLA and Skogsforsk. A reference <b>trial</b> employing traditional <b>pile</b> sampling was carried out by VTT. Easily applicable drying models for logging residues, whole trees, stem wood and stumps were developed. A large variety of meteorological parameters can be used for model input. Parameters ranged from basic data like relative air humidity and air temperature to more complex parameters like evaporation and equilibrium moisture content of fuel wood. Fuel wood drying models can improve the fuel wood supply chain by helping the supplier find and choose those wood piles that are drier and thus with a higher calorific value for delivery. It enables supplier to deliver fuel wood which better meets the demands of the customers. Transport can be optimized by these models too. The drying models can also be used to formulate recommendations concerning seasoning of residues and optimum storage times for different assortment, species and drying conditions. An outlook on future application and further research needs was provided. Machine vision technology for sorting of fuel wood by quality and particle size, as well as for assessing the volume of a delivered fuel wood load was tested by VTT and JAMK. INFRES partners provided chip samples from all over Europe for testing. RGB images proved to work very well when identifying shapes and sizes of chips. If odd particles have the same colour as woody material, RGB images could not identify them. Measuring wood chip loads with a time‐of‐flight (TOF) camera rendered the most promising results. The average error was about 10 %. Compared to visible light technology, near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy proved to be much more accurate in determining fuel wood moisture content and detecting foreign objects. Technology based on visible light is not able to work online (moving chips). To the contrary, NIR technology proved to work online and therefore could be used at a power plant or fuel wood terminal where wood chips are moved with a conveyer. However, NIR technology has other challenges such as not being able to give reliable moisture information with regard to frozen materials. Furthermore, an outlook on future research needs was provided...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{fundamentals}} of composting science from a pragmatic perspective of necessity involves mixtures of different sizes and types of particles in constantly changing environmental conditions, in particular temperature. The complexity of composting is affected by this environmental variation. With so much "noise" in the system, a question arises as {{to the need to}} understand the detail of this complexity as understanding any part of composting with more precision than this level of noise is not likely to result in greater understanding of the system. Yet some compost piles generate offensive odours while others don‟t and science should be able to explain this difference. A driver for this research was greater understanding of potential odour, which is assumed to arise from the anaerobic core of a composting particle. It follows that the size of this anaerobic core could be used as an indicator of odour potential. A first step in this understanding is the need to determine which parts of a composting particle are aerobic, from which the anaerobic proportion can be determined by difference. To this end, this thesis uses a finite volume method of analysis to determine the distribution of oxygen at sub-particle scales. Diffusion laws were used to determine the thickness of each finite volume. The resulting model, called micro-environment analysis, was applied to a composting particle to enable determination of onion ring type volumes of compost (called micro-environments) containing substrates (further subdivided into substrate fractions) whose concentrations could be determined to high precision by the application of first-order degradation kinetics to each of these finite volumes. Determination of the oxygen concentration at a micro-environment's inner boundary was achieved by using the Stępniewski equation. The Stępniewski model was derived originally for application to soil aeration and enables each micro-environment to have its own oxygen uptake rate and diffusion coefficient. This first version of micro-environment analysis was derived from the simpler solution to diffusion laws, based on the assumption of non-diffusible substrate. It was tested against three sets of experimental data with two different substrates: Particle size trials using dog sausage as substrate – where the peak composting rate was successfully predicted, as a function of particle size. Temperature trials using pig faeces and a range of particle sizes – the results showed the potential of micro-environment analysis to identify intriguing temperature effects, in particular, a different temperature effect (Q 10) and fraction proportion was indicated for each substrate fraction. Smaller particle sizes, and possibly outward diffusion of substrate confounded a clear experimental signal. Diffusion into a <b>pile</b> <b>trials</b> which showed that the time course of particles deeper in the pile could be predicted by the physics of oxygen distribution. A fully computed prediction would need an added level of computational complexity in micro-environment analysis, arising from there being two intertwined phases, gas phase and substrate (particle) phase. Each phase needs its own micro-environment calculations which can not be done in isolation from each other. Unexplainable parts of the composting time course are likely to be partly explained by the outward diffusion of substrate towards the inward-moving oxygen front. Although the possibility of alternative electron acceptors can not be discounted as a partial explanation. To test the theory, a new experimental reactor was developed using calorimetry. With an absolute sensitivity of 0. 132 J hr- 1 L- 1 and a measurement frequency of 30 minutes, the reactor was able to detect the energy required to humidify the input air, and "see" when composting begins to decline as oxygen is consumed. Optimisation of the aeration pumping frequency using the evidence from the data was strikingly apparent immediately after setting the optimum frequency. Micro-environment analysis provides a framework by which several physical effects can be incorporated into compost science...|$|R
