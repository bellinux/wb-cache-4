5|$|At Parken Stadium, {{where the}} final {{was to be}} played, the police erected iron fencing outside to {{separate}} the Arsenal and Galatasaray fans as a precaution.

5|$|Despite this reserve, early {{settlers}} {{extended their}} fences to the river. In 1791, the Land Board ordered that <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> be removed {{to permit the}} reserve's use as a public road. The Niagara Road quickly became the primary route between Fort Erie and Fort George. Its importance grew with the declaration of war against the Americans in June 1812. During the war, the road became vital for the movement of militia and supplies, and accordingly {{it was one of}} the primary frontiers of the war.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fences</b> {{around the}} {{perimeter}} of the ground fronting the terracing (which were to prevent fans, notably hooligans, running onto the pitch) were removed immediately post Hillsborough, in time for the rearranged league fixture with Liverpool. The Everton match versus Luton Town in May 1991 was the final time that Gwladys Street allowed standing spectators. Seats were installed in the Paddock, while the Lower Gwladys Street was later completely rebuilt to accommodate seating with new concrete steps.|$|E
5|$|After Marie Henriette's death, Leopold's {{relationship}} with Caroline became flagrantly open, and he placed her across from his Laeken mansion, in the Villa Vanderborght, even building a pedestrian bridge (above the ground, and over <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> of the mansion) {{so he could}} see her at will. The bridge reveals the king's jealousy, although this may have been justified, as her former lover Durrieux had been caught with her on several occasions. Caroline tried to pass him off as her brother when Leopold caught the two together; one publication reported that she and Durrieux had placed secret electric bells in all her residences so that servants could warn her when the king was approaching.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the inner}} {{security}} zone, the Schutzstreifen, a further 743people (15%) were {{arrested by the}} guards. 48people (1%) were stopped– i.e. killed or injured– by landmines and 43people (0.9%) by SM-70 directional mines on the fence. A further 67people (1.35%) were intercepted at the fence (shot and/or arrested). A total of 229people– just 4.6% of attempted escapees, representing less than one in twenty– made it across the fence. Of these, the largest number (129, or 55% of successful escapees) succeeded in making it across the fence in unmined sectors. 89people (39% of escapees) managed to cross both the minefields and the fence, but just 12people (6% of the total) succeeded in getting past the SM-70s booby-trap mines on <b>the</b> <b>fences.</b>|$|E

25|$|By October 2000, {{the number}} of bras had reached around 200, and again <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> was cleared of bras. This time the story spread even wider, as <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> had become to some a quirky tourist attraction, and media sources from as far afield as Europe became {{interested}} in <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> Due to this interest, {{the number of}} bras being added to <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> personally, or sent to be added, increased dramatically. In early 2006, the number of bras attached to <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> stood at close to 800.|$|R
50|$|The {{sprawling}} prison complex {{was divided}} into compounds. The perimeter of the each compound was secured by a double barbed-wire fence, fifteen feet in height, on top of which ran a high-voltage wire. The space between <b>the</b> two <b>fences</b> was a tangled mass of barbed-wire. On the prisoners' side of <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> a wire ran parallel with <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> staked to <b>the</b> ground approximately ten feet from <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> six to eight inches above the ground. Any man who stepped between the wire and <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> was shot on sight. Every so many yards along <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> was a guard tower, fully armed and manned.|$|R
5|$|Revolt {{began to}} stir in St Albans in Hertfordshire late on 13 June, when news broke {{of the events}} in London. There had been long-running {{disagreements}} in St Albans between {{the town and the}} local abbey, which had extensive privileges in the region. On 14 June, protesters met with the Abbot, Thomas de la Mare, and demanded their freedom from the abbey. A group of townsmen under the leadership of William Grindecobbe traveled to London, where they appealed to the King for the rights of the abbey to be abolished. Wat Tyler, then still in control of the city, granted them authority in the meantime to take direct action against the abbey. Grindecobbe and the rebels returned to St Albans, where they found the Prior had already fled. The rebels broke open the abbey gaol, destroyed <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> marking out the abbey lands and burnt the abbey records in the town square. They then forced Thomas de la Mare to surrender the abbey's rights in a charter on 16 June. The revolt against the abbey spread out over the next few days, with abbey property and financial records being destroyed across the county.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 and 2002, several riots {{broke out}} at Sangatte, {{and groups of}} {{migrants}} (up to 550 in a December 2001 incident) stormed <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> and attempted to enter en masse.|$|E

25|$|The {{cemetery}} {{made two}} major repairs in 2011. Advisory Neighborhood Commission 5C met with cemetery officials to discuss <b>the</b> deteriorating <b>fence</b> along <b>the</b> alley south of Bryant Street NE. <b>The</b> <b>fence</b> was overgrown, and damaged {{in places where}} local people had attempted to dump trash and large objects over <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> Although <b>the</b> damage was not the fault of Prospect Hill, the cemetery agreed to repair <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> {{at a cost of}} $5,500. Repairs included removing vegetation, repairing <b>the</b> wall and <b>fence,</b> extending <b>the</b> wall and <b>fence</b> a short distance, and reinforcing <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> posts with angle braces.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>fencing</b> was {{established}} in 1837 simultaneously with the monument to the Empress Catherine II between the Nevsky Prospect and the Rossi Street. <b>The</b> <b>fencing</b> design is simple: its links fasten to cylindrical racks, {{and at the top}} of <b>the</b> <b>fencing</b> there are sharp peaks.|$|R

25|$|The {{recommendations}} of the Taylor Report led {{to a series of}} improvements to safety at grounds across the United Kingdom. The terraces at Hillsborough were converted to all seated accommodation over the following four years, and <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> around the pitch were replaced with low safety-barricades to allow incursion onto the playing surface in case of emergency.|$|E
25|$|The battle began before dawn. The {{first part}} of the battle {{consisted}} of Polish hussars repeatedly charging the fortified Russian positions, attempting to break them. The Polish forces continued to make ferocious attacks, and Samuel Maskiewicz, a witness from one hussar company, claimed that his unit charged eight or ten times. The Polish hussars' attack on the infantry, hidden behind <b>the</b> <b>fences,</b> and using firearms, were not successful.|$|E
50|$|In practice, once most {{animals have}} {{learned of the}} {{unpleasant}} consequences of touching <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> they tend to avoid it for considerable periods {{even when it is}} inactive. However, some animals learn to avoid the shock, either by running under <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> quickly between pulses, or by pushing other individuals through <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> Animals with thick woolly coats (such as sheep or highland cattle) may learn to push through <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> themselves, using their coats as electrical insulation. Some animals also learn to recognize the slight clicking sound made by some electric fences and thus can sense when <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> is off.|$|R
25|$|On August 29, 2007, a {{chain link}} fence was {{constructed}} around <b>the</b> protesters. <b>The</b> <b>fence</b> was erected to prevent {{confrontation between the}} protesters and the sellout crowd of 72,516 people (17,000 of them from Tennessee, the opposing team) that were expected to attend the opening game of the California Golden Bears' football season. Protesters responded with shouts and promises to {{make it difficult for}} the UCPD to guard <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> <b>The</b> protesters claimed <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> was erected not to protect them, but to starve them out. Some have drawn comparisons between the building of <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> and <b>the</b> attempted take back of People's Park in 1969, in which the California National Guard was called in to remove protesters. Initially the police did not allow food and water to be passed over <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> to <b>the</b> tree sitters, but started to allow the deliveries by the evening. Two men were arrested following scuffles with police. Around 200 additional people joined hands around <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> in support of the tree sitters. <b>The</b> <b>fence</b> cost <b>the</b> University between $10,000 and $12,000 to build. Despite <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> more protesters took up spots in the trees.|$|R

25|$|The Mafia's {{protection}} is {{not restricted to}} illegal activities. Shopkeepers often pay the Mafia {{to protect them from}} thieves. If a shopkeeper enters into a protection contract with a mafioso, the mafioso will make it publicly known that if any thief were foolish enough to rob his client's shop, he would track down the thief, beat him up, and, if possible, recover the stolen merchandise (mafiosi make it their business to know all <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> in their territory).|$|E
25|$|Congress {{hesitated to}} pass a leasing act, and the United States Department of the Interior was {{determined}} to remove <b>the</b> <b>fences.</b> By November 1902, the Rushville Standard reported that Bartlett Richards had been ordered to remove his fences in Sheridan and Cherry Counties. The fenced enclosed about 60 civil townships, which {{would be enough to}} support 960 families at two sections per family. The Secretary of the Interior, Ethan A. Hitchcock, following the Roosevelt administration's direction, set out to enforce the 1885 Van Wyck Law, which forbade the fencing of public lands.|$|E
50|$|On 15 August 2011, Aintree {{announced}} new {{modifications to}} Becher's Brook following {{a review of}} the course {{in the aftermath of the}} 2011 National.

This difference in drop from the inside to the outside of <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> has been retained to encourage riders to spread out across the width of <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> and also to retain the unique characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> <b>The</b> height of <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> remains unaltered at 4 ft 10 inches.|$|R

25|$|In {{the first}} year there were 7 teams in total. They needed a home run fence which {{they did not have}} at Silcock Street and could not put up.

25|$|Kelley's most {{elaborate}} crossover was only partially successful. He sought to crossover {{an episode of}} his Picket Fences with Chris Carter's The X-Files. Both shows aired Friday nights, but on different networks. The intent was to begin the story on one show, then hope viewers would switch channels to watch the conclusion on another network. CBS balked, and both scripts were rewritten, with The X-Files Fox Mulder no longer set to appear on Picket Fences. Yet, both episodes deal with Wisconsin and cows, with Fences referencing an FBI investigation in a neighboring town. CBS blurred the connection further by postponing <b>the</b> <b>Fences</b> episode by one week.|$|E
50|$|As the {{survivors}} bury the dead, a massive group of walkers converges {{at a single}} portion of <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) points out the carcasses of several dead rats at <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> suggesting that someone has been feeding the walkers, which lures them in and causes them to cluster together instead of spreading out.
