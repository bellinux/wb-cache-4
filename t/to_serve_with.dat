5|$|At {{the time}} of Aqil's escape, the Ottomans were engaged in the Crimean War with the Russian Empire, which left a {{domestic}} security void in its provinces due to {{the large number of}} provincial troops deployed to Crimea. To restore security in the Galilee, Aqil was reassigned to his powerful post in the region in 1855. On his return to Palestine, Aqil's Hanadi tribesmen abandoned their conscription orders <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>with</b> the Ottoman Army in the Crimean War and instead returned to Aqil's service. Aqil was once again charged with protecting the routes of rural Palestine and occasionally Transjordan. He was once commissioned to collect taxes from Karak.|$|E

Blakely patrolled along the East Coast of the United States until she was decommissioned on 29 June 1922, and returned to Philadelphia. She was recommissioned from 1932 to 1937 <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>with</b> the Scouting Fleet, and then was again decommissioned in Philadelphia. Low military budgets were the cause of these periods of inactivity, as the Navy did not have the funds or manpower to maintain a number of ships, including Blakeley.|$|E

5|$|Despite his age of 59 or 60 at the time, Brandon was {{permitted}} <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>with</b> the Confederate States Army in 1861 as lieutenant colonel of the 21st Mississippi Infantry Regiment {{and went to}} Virginia. In July 1861, Brandon contracted a cold, prompting {{him to take a}} leave from active service until the end of August. His subordinates did not believe him fit for duty again and he did not receive an appointment to colonel. Brandon and his regiment were placed in the Confederate Army of the Potomac in Virginia. During the summer and fall of 1861, Brandon's unit was on duty in the northeastern part of the state. During the Yorktown siege, his regiment, along with other Confederate army units, were spread out across eastern Virginia between Culpeper, Fredricksburg, and Norfolk, forming the Warwick Line. Brandon's regiment would again see action in the Battle of Williamsburg, fought the day after the action at Yorktown.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{initial safety}} concerns, DC-10 {{aircraft}} continued <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>with</b> passenger airlines for over 30 {{years after the}} crash of Flight 191. In the end, it was newer, more fuel-efficient twin-engined airplanes from Boeing and Airbus and not safety concerns that ultimately ended the passenger career of the DC-10. Many retired passenger DC-10s have since been converted to all-cargo use. DC-10 freighters, along with its derivative, the MD-11, form {{the backbone of the}} FedEx Express fleet. The DC-10s have been upgraded with the glass cockpit from the MD-11, thereby turning them into MD-10s. American Airlines retired its last DC-10s in 2000 after 29 years of service. In February 2014, Biman Bangladesh Airlines operated the final DC-10 passenger flights. DC-10s continue to be used extensively in air freight operations, and military variants also remain in service.|$|E
