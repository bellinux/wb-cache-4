5|$|Jogaila {{formulated}} the Treaty of Dubysa, which rewarded the Knights {{for their}} aid in defeating Kęstutis and Vytautas by promising Christianisation and granting them Samogitia {{west of the}} Dubysa river. However, when Jogaila failed to ratify the treaty, the Knights invaded Lithuania {{in the summer of}} 1383. In 1384, Jogaila reconciled with Vytautas promising to return his patrimony in Trakai. Vytautas then <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> the Knights, attacking and looting several Prussian castles.|$|E

5|$|Alexander I Aldea (14311436) was {{the first}} Romanian ruler {{to be forced to}} render {{military}} service to the Ottomans. Two decades later, Vlad III the Impaler (1448, 14561462, 1476), notorious as the model for the Dracula legend, <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> the Ottoman Empire. He carried out a series of attacks across the Danube in the winter of 14611462. The response was a massive invasion led by Mehmed II who drove Vlad III from the throne and replaced him with his brother, Radu III the Fair (14621475). Due to the frequent military operations, the Wallachian Plain was heavily depopulated {{after the end of the}} 14thcentury. On the other hand, Wallachia received a steady flow of immigrants, mostly from the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Alien Rage is a first-person shooter {{video game}} for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 (through Xbox Live Arcade), and PlayStation 3 (through PlayStation Network).

In its single player campaign, players are put in control of an elite soldier named Jack. Jack is sent to destroy a mining facility and the aliens within it after the aliens <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> and killed the humans that they had shared the facility with.|$|E
5|$|As {{territorial}} {{governor of}} Montana, Leslie quickly drew {{the ire of}} the press for his pro-temperance position. The territory's political machinery also <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> him, and he was removed from office by President Benjamin Harrison. When Grover Cleveland succeeded Harrison {{for a second term}} in office, he appointed Leslie district attorney for Montana. Leslie continued to practice law well into his eighties, and was being considered for a district court judgeship in Montana when he fell ill with pneumonia and died on February 7, 1907, at the age of 87.|$|E

5|$|As the {{convention}} began, Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York, the floor {{leader for the}} Grant forces (known as the Stalwart faction), proposed that the delegates pledge to support the eventual nominee in the general election. When three West Virginia delegates declined to be so bound, Conkling sought to expel them from {{the convention}}. Garfield rose to defend the men, giving a passionate speech in defense {{of their right to}} reserve judgment. The crowd <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> Conkling, and he withdrew the motion. The performance delighted Garfield's boosters, who now believed more than ever that he was the only man who could attract a majority of the delegates' votes.|$|E

Meanwhile, Mace is debating the anti-Inhuman Senator Ellen Nadeer on live television, who brings up the prison situation which he is not aware of. Faced with further questions from Nadeer, Mace reveals that he is an Inhuman himself.|$|E
5|$|Barbauld's {{career as}} a poet ended {{abruptly}} in 1812 {{with the publication of}} Eighteen Hundred and Eleven, which criticised Britain's participation in the Napoleonic Wars. She was shocked by the vicious reviews it received and published nothing else in her lifetime. Her reputation was further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the French Revolution <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> her in their later, more conservative years. Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children's writer in the nineteenth century, and largely forgotten in the twentieth, but the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1980s renewed interest in her works and restored her place in literary history.|$|E

5|$|Conditions {{in camps}} varied {{considerably}} geographically and over time. Conditions were particularly {{poor in the}} summer of 1940, when facilities proved insufficient to accommodate the large number of new POWs, and in the particularly cold winter that same year. Gradually, as prisoners were repatriated, relieving overcrowding, conditions generally improved. From 1943, however, as the war on the Eastern Front <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> Germany, conditions worsened and the food supply became more precarious. Some camps were purpose-built, like Stalag II-D, but others could be former barracks, asylums or fortresses.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the attack}} on his family, Captain Pipe {{said that he would}} not seek vengeance. Instead, in September 1778, {{he was one of the}} signers of the Treaty of Fort Pitt between the Delawares and the United States. Americans hoped this {{agreement}} with the Delawares would enable American soldiers to pass through Delaware territory and attack Detroit, but the alliance deteriorated after the death of White Eyes, the Delaware chief who had negotiated the treaty. Eventually, Captain Pipe <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> the Americans and moved his followers west to the Sandusky River, where he received support from the British in Detroit.|$|E
5|$|Despite the treaty, Henry {{set about}} inflicting severe {{penalties}} on the barons who had stood against {{him during the}} invasion. William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey, was accused of fresh crimes, which were {{not covered by the}} Alton amnesty, and was banished from England. In 1102 Henry then <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> Robert of Bellême and his brothers, the most powerful of the barons, accusing him of 45 different offences. Robert escaped and took up arms against Henry. Henry besieged Robert's castles at Arundel, Tickhill and Shrewsbury, pushing down into the south-west to attack Bridgnorth. His power base in England broken, Robert accepted Henry's offer of banishment and left the country for Normandy.|$|E

5|$|During 1944, {{the balance}} of naval power in the Pacific decisively <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> Japan, and by early 1945, its fleet was much {{depleted}} and badly hobbled by critical fuel shortages in the home islands. In {{a desperate attempt to}} slow the Allied advance, Yamato was dispatched on a one-way mission to Okinawa in April 1945, with orders to beach herself and fight until destroyed protecting the island. The task force was spotted south of Kyushu by US submarines and aircraft, and on 7 April 1945 she was sunk by American carrier-based bombers and torpedo bombers with the loss of most of her crew.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Macedonian War, Nabis {{had another}} {{possibility}} for expansion. Philip of Macedon offered him the polis of Argos {{in exchange for}} Sparta defecting from the Roman coalition and joining the Macedonian alliance. Nabis accepted and received control over Argos. However, when the war <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> Macedon, he rejoined the Roman coalition and sent 600 Cretan mercenaries to support the Roman army. Philip was later decisively defeated by the Romans {{at the battle of}} Cynoscephalae, but Sparta remained in control of Argos. After the war, the Roman army did not withdraw from Greece, but instead sent garrisons to various strategic locations across Greece to secure its interests.|$|E
5|$|Even though Sava's {{diplomacy}} was of {{no effect}} either, Strez died the night after Sava's departure. Serbian sources present the death of Strez as a miracle, Strez being stabbed by an angel, though in reality he was very likely murdered in a plot orchestrated by Sava. Historian John V. A. Fine theorizes that Sava may have found supporters among Strez's nobles, {{some of whom had}} <b>turned</b> <b>against</b> him and organized his murder, only to defect to Serbia immediately afterwards. According to the hagiography of Saint Sava, in his dying words Strez claimed he was stabbed by a young soldier on the order of Sava.|$|E
