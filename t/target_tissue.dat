40|$|Interactions of mineralocorticoids and {{glucocorticoids}} in epithelial <b>target</b> <b>tissues.</b> BackgroundIn Na+-transporting epithelial <b>target</b> <b>tissues,</b> such as mammalian {{kidney and}} the isolated toad bladder, glucocorticoids (GCs) do not normally elicit Na+ retention. In mammalian kidney, however, they do cause kaliuresis. The presence of 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isoform 2 (11 β-HSD 2) in these <b>target</b> <b>tissues</b> inactivates the GCs, {{preventing them from}} accessing mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) and stimulating Na+ transport. ResultsThe usually observed Na+ retention elicited by the mineralocorticoid aldosterone was blunted when the GC corticosterone was coadministered along with aldosterone. However, when corticosterone was administered along with a 11 β-HSD 2 inhibitor, a strong Na+ transport was elicited by an MR-mediated mechanism. 11 -Dehydrocorticosterone also blunted aldosterone-elicited Na+ transport in these <b>target</b> <b>tissues.</b> Conclusions 11 β-HSD 2 appears to play two important roles in the epithelial <b>target</b> <b>tissues,</b> kidney and toad bladder. The first is to protect GC access to MR, and the second involves {{the product of the}} enzyme to regulate the magnitude of aldosterone-induced Na+ retention...|$|R

25|$|Systemic {{radioisotope}} therapy (RIT) {{is a form}} {{of targeted}} therapy. Targeting can be due to the chemical properties of the isotope such as radioiodine which is specifically absorbed by the thyroid gland a thousandfold better than other bodily organs. Targeting can also be achieved by attaching the radioisotope to another molecule or antibody to guide it to the <b>target</b> <b>tissue.</b> The radioisotopes are delivered through infusion (into the bloodstream) or ingestion. Examples are the infusion of metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) to treat neuroblastoma, of oral iodine-131 to treat thyroid cancer or thyrotoxicosis, and of hormone-bound lutetium-177 and yttrium-90 to treat neuroendocrine tumors (peptide receptor radionuclide therapy).|$|E
25|$|Free {{testosterone}} (T) is transported {{into the}} cytoplasm of <b>target</b> <b>tissue</b> cells, {{where it can}} bind to the androgen receptor, or {{can be reduced to}} 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5α-reductase. DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than testosterone, so that its androgenic potency is about 5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects.|$|E

40|$|THE MINERALOCORTICOID {{receptor}} (MR) mediates aldosterone {{actions on}} salt and water balance within restricted target cells. As {{a member of}} the nuclear receptor superfamily (1), MR acts as a ligand-induced transcription factor by modulating expression of specific proteins involved in the physiological responses to aldosterone (2). The receptor is expressed at very low levels in epithelial <b>target</b> <b>tissues</b> such as the distal nephron (3, 4), the distal colon and rectum (5, 6), and salivary and sweat glands (3, 7).

25|$|The {{delivery}} method determines the dose required to raise an effective immune response. Saline injections require variable amounts of DNA, from 10μg-1mg, whereas gene gun deliveries require 100 to 1000 times. Generally, 0.2μg – 20μg are required, although quantities {{as low as}} 16ng have been reported. These quantities vary by species. Mice for example, require approximately 10 times less DNA than primates. Saline injections require more DNA because the DNA is delivered to the extracellular spaces of the <b>target</b> <b>tissue</b> (normally muscle), where it has to overcome physical barriers (such as the basal lamina and large amounts of connective tissue, to mention a few) before it is {{taken up by the}} cells, while gene gun deliveries bombard DNA directly into the cells, resulting in less “wastage”.|$|E
500|$|People {{who have}} two mutated {{copies of the}} BRCA2 gene have one type of Fanconi anemia. This {{condition}} is caused by extremely reduced levels of the BRCA2 protein in cells, which allows the accumulation of damaged DNA. Patients with Fanconi anemia are prone to several types of leukemia (a type of blood cell cancer); solid tumors, particularly of the head, neck, skin, and reproductive organs; and bone marrow suppression (reduced blood cell production that leads to anemia). [...] Women having inherited a defective BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene have risks for breast and ovarian cancer that are so high and seem so selective that many mutation carriers choose to have prophylactic surgery. There has been much conjecture to explain such apparently striking tissue specificity. Major determinants of where BRCA1 and BRCA2 associated hereditary cancers occur are related to tissue specificity of the cancer pathogen, the agent that causes chronic inflammation or the carcinogen. The <b>target</b> <b>tissue</b> may have receptors for the pathogen, become selectively exposed to carcinogens and an infectious process. An innate genomic deficit impairs normal responses and exacerbates the susceptibility to disease in organ targets. This theory also fits data for several tumor suppressors beyond BRCA1 or BRCA2. A major advantage of this model is that it suggests there are some options in addition to prophylactic surgery.|$|E

After an acute exposure via ip injection, adducts were detected at 3 hr in leukocytes, liver, and bladder. The disappearance of DNA-carcinogen adducts in liver and leukocytes were parallel over the 24 -hr period studied. Following a 7 -day continuous exposure to 2 -AF via drinking water, adduct levels in leukocytes and <b>target</b> <b>tissues</b> were responsive to dose at 30, 100, and 300 ppm. Adduct levels at the highest dose reached 17, 000 fmol/mg DNA in leukocytes, 1900 fmol/mg in liver, and 2300 fmol/mg in bladder. Although adduct levels after 7 days were highest in leukocytes, adducts were not detectable in leukocytes 7 days after discontinuing exposure. In contrast, liver and bladder retained approximately 50 and 75 % of their respective adduct levels 7 days after exposure was stopped.

2500|$|In the 21st {{century the}} {{original}} concept of radiosurgery [...] {{expanded to include}} treatments comprising up to five fractions, and stereotactic radiosurgery has been redefined as a distinct neurosurgical discipline that utilizes externally generated ionizing radiation to inactivate or eradicate defined targets, typically in the head or spine, {{without the need for}} a surgical incision. [...] Irrespective of the similarities between the concepts of stereotactic radiosurgery and fractionated radiotherapy the intent of both approaches is fundamentally different, although both treatment modalities are reported to have identical outcomes for certain indications. The aim of stereotactic radiosurgery is to destroy <b>target</b> <b>tissue</b> while preserving adjacent normal tissue, where fractionated radiotherapy relies on a different sensitivity of the target and the surrounding normal tissue to the total accumulated radiation dose. Historically, the field of fractionated radiotherapy evolved from the original concept of stereotactic radiosurgery following discovery of the principles of radiobiology: repair, reassortment, repopulation, and reoxygenation. Today, both treatment techniques are complementary, as tumors that may be resistant to fractionated radiotherapy may respond well to radiosurgery, and tumors that are too large or too close to critical organs for safe radiosurgery may be suitable candidates for fractionated radiotherapy.|$|E
