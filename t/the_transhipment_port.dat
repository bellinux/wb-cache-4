40|$|The {{workshop}} {{is based}} around {{the development of}} a brand new port facility in Cameroon (West Africa) south of the Mboro cape at Kribi. The client supplied a large collection of data in order to perform a complete assessment of the area including a full metocean study, geotechnical investigation, breakwater and port facility design, vessel fleet analysis, construction feasibility exercise, port layout of both dry and wet infrastructure, and a physical modelling campaign to test and observe the selected breakwater configuration. In addition, a large variety of software and computational tools were provided, inducing TOMAWAC, Refonde, ROBOT and TALRIN. These programs were taught by visiting guest lectures and support staff at ESITC Caen. The nature and use of these programs in the project will be discussed in the following report. Besides the extensive technical support during the workshop and involvement in the project work, a series of technical visits were also arranged. The report describes the technical visits and lessons learnt in detail. The locations that were visited were the Port of Le Havre, a perforated breakwater at Granville, dredging works at Mont-Saint Michelle, the inland port of Blainville, a Ro-Ro terminal and breakwater at Ouistreham, and finally <b>the</b> <b>transhipment</b> <b>port</b> of Honfleur. These visits built a physical understanding of many of the elements discussed in the workshop. In addition to absorbing many technical details at each of these locations, the visits were also meant to promote French society, and working culture.

40|$|AbstractThe article {{starts from}} the “National Strategic Plan of the Harbours and Logistics”, {{approved}} by the Italian Government in July 2015, setting out the development strategies of the Italian port system and providing, among the other things, the redesign of the governance of the Italian port system. The old existing 24 Port authorities are replaced by 15 Authorities of port- system, in which different ports are combined {{in order to create}} an efficient port system able to compete and succeed in the overall system of commercial traffic in the Mediterranean Sea. Within this framework, {{the creation of a new}} Authority is provided, which incorporates the former Calabrian Port System with the old Port Authority of Messina. In this way we are going to create a large port system, centred on the area of the Messina Strait, comprising 10 ports, including <b>the</b> <b>transhipment</b> <b>port</b> of Gioia Tauro, which represents the core of the entire port system, and the port of Messina, the most important passenger port in Italy and one of the most important as regards the cruise sector. The article analyses the development perspectives that this system can offer with regard to two important aspects:the realization of the project -already imagined in the late’ 60 s- for an Integrated Metropolitan Area of the Strait, including the two metropolitan cities of Messina and Reggio Calabria;the transformation of the port of Gioia Tauro, from an exclusively transhipment port into an Intermodal Logistics Pole, which will be the central strategic hub of a large logistics platform of the Strait Area, whose implementation should be a great opportunity for the development of the entire Mezzogiorno...|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of transport projects {{has become increasingly}} complex. Different aspects {{have to be taken}} into account and the consequences of the problems are usually far reaching and the different policy alternatives are numerous and difficult to predict. Several pressure or action groups have also emerged causing an even more complex decision making process. The use of multi criteria analysis for the {{evaluation of}} transport projects has increased due to this increasing complexity of the problem situation. At the same time, the importance of stakeholders within this evaluation process should have been recognized. Researches on transport projects are generally carried out to provide information to policymakers that have to operate within restrictive parameters (political, economical, social, etc 2 ̆ 026). Researchers should therefore take greater account of the different priorities of stakeholders such as policymakers, private enterprises and households. These stakeholders should be incorporated explicitly in the evaluation process. The Analytic Hierarchy Process is one of the Fuzzy Multiple Criteria Decision Making methods. It can be applied in a very broad range of applications of decision problems. Logistics, urban planning, public politics, marketing, finance, education, economics are a part of this wide application area. In transport subjects it can be used for the evaluation of transport policy measures or decision making problems. Due to its wide range application area, it has been an exciting research subject for many different field researchers. The aim of this paper is to introduce AHP method and to offer how to benefit it for the preference of urban planners in transport problems. This paper is composed of two main parts. First part consists of the literature survey regarding with the AHP and its application areas. The advantage of methods had been mentioned. Second part focuses on a sample application of AHP technique. The study uses AHP technique to determine the selection criteria in <b>the</b> <b>transhipment</b> <b>port</b> selection decision-making process...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this paper applies the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to reveal and analyse <b>transhipment</b> <b>port</b> selection by global carriers. In all, 47 relevant service attributes were recorded from a literature review. Two rounds of Delphi surveys – followed by brainstorming sessions – were conducted among experts in industry and academia, in order to narrow their number to four main service attributes/criteria comprising 12 sub-criteria. An AHP designed questionnaire survey was distributed to 20 port users, which covered the total population of global ocean container operators, and to 20 <b>transhipment</b> service providers (<b>port</b> operators/authorities). The results of the AHP analysis revealed that both global container carriers and port service providers had a similar perception of the most important service attributes for <b>transhipment</b> <b>port</b> selection. However, <b>the</b> AHP weight ranking of the sub-criteria involved was not identical between the two surveys, providing scope for further adaptation of service providers to users' priorities. Differences in the performance ranking of six major container ports by global carriers, as revealed in the AHP survey, were then combined with the calculated weights for <b>the</b> 12 <b>transhipment</b> <b>port</b> selection sub-criteria to explore critical attributes where transhipment market strategy could focus.

In particular, we focus on quay-side problems (berth allocation and quay crane scheduling), yard-side problems (tactical and operational yard management), vehicle routing problems and human resources management problems. The common final aim, in facing the above problems, is to improve the efficiency, and thus the competitiveness of the container terminal.

40|$|The {{handling}} of explosives and ammunition introduces a safety risk for personnel and third parties. Accidents related to storage, transport and transhipment {{may result in}} severe injury and material damage. TNO has developed a number of tools to quantify the consequences and risks of accidental explosions. Risk {{is defined as the}} multiplication of the probability of an event and its consequences. The tools differ in their application, considering explosion safety on a military base (within the home country or on a mission), or external safety (related to third parties outside a military base). Some tools are aimed at consequences, others also give risk quantities as output. Risk-NL is our national software for the risk analysis of ammunition storage sites. The individual risk and group risk calculated with Risk-NL have to be compared to Dutch risk criteria. Specifically for <b>transhipment</b> in <b>ports</b> <b>the</b> TNO <b>Transhipment</b> Tool can be employed. In this tool the probability of an accidental explosion depends on the exact type and frequency of <b>the</b> <b>transhipment.</b> <b>The</b> AASTP- 5 Consequence Analysis Tool was developed for military bases abroad, taking into account the protection offered by specific armoured containers against various threats. This tool has been integrated in the latest version of the NATO Field Storage Manual AASTP- 5, and is available for member nations. In the research program ‘Survivability of Compounds’, funded by the Dutch MoD this tool was further developed to predict not only physical consequences, but also consequence for the mission goals (i. e. at the system level). The Klotz Group Engineering Tool has been developed together with international partners in the Klotz Group, a group of explosives safety experts from 8 nations.
