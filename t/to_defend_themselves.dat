5|$|Ueshiba's {{goal was}} to create an art that {{practitioners}} could use <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> while also protecting their attacker from injury.|$|E
5|$|Strategies <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> against predators {{include the}} {{expulsion}} of ink, the use of camouflage and threat displays, their ability to jet quickly through the water, {{and their ability to}} hide. All octopuses are venomous, but only the blue-ringed octopuses are known to be deadly to humans.|$|E
5|$|Beetles, both {{adults and}} larvae, are the prey of many animal predators {{including}} mammals from bats to rodents, birds, lizards, amphibians, fishes, dragonflies, robberflies, reduviid bugs, ants, other beetles, and spiders. Beetles {{use a variety}} of anti-predator adaptations <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>themselves.</b> These include camouflage and mimicry against predators that hunt by sight, toxicity, and defensive behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Power {{disparity}} (the target {{lacks the}} power <b>to</b> successfully <b>defend</b> <b>themselves).</b>|$|R
2500|$|The first {{casualty}} of the encounter was Siyyid Ridá—Mullá Husayn's attendant—who {{was shot in the}} chest from a distance. After Siyyid Ridá's death, Mullá Husayn allowed his followers <b>to</b> begin <b>defending</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Packbow {{was invented}} by Jon Perdue while he was researching Latin American [...] "collapsed {{societies}}, and what {{people who lived in}} those societies came up with <b>to</b> either <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> or <b>to</b> survive." ...|$|R
5|$|Many {{bees are}} aposematically coloured, {{typically}} orange and black, warning {{of their ability}} <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> with a powerful sting. As such they are models for Batesian mimicry by non-stinging insects such as bee-flies, robber flies and hoverflies, all of which gain a measure of protection by superficially looking and behaving like bees.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the player}} enters the Throne Room with their prince, {{they become the}} king and takes control of the King's Guard. The other players lose {{the ability to control}} their men-at-arms, with their men staying in their rooms <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>themselves.</b> If the new king dies, the King's Guard will return to being neutral and the other princes regain their men.|$|E
5|$|Although Montcalm {{and other}} French {{officers}} attempted to stop further attacks, others did not, and some explicitly refused to provide further protection to the British. At this point, the column dissolved, as some {{tried to escape}} the Indian onslaught, while others actively tried <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>themselves.</b> Massachusetts Colonel Joseph Frye reported that he was stripped of much of his clothing and repeatedly threatened. He fled into the woods, and did not reach Fort Edward until 12 August.|$|E
5000|$|Though Épée's {{original}} interest was in religious education, his public advocacy {{and development of}} a kind of [...] "Signed French" [...] enabled deaf people <b>to</b> legally <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> in court for the first time.|$|R
5000|$|The Amish did {{not believe}} in going to court to settle {{disputes}} but instead follow the biblical command to [...] "turn the other cheek." [...] Thus, the Amish are at a disadvantage when it comes <b>to</b> <b>defending</b> <b>themselves</b> in courts or before legislative committees. However, a Lutheran minister, Reverend William C. Lindholm, took an interest in Amish legal difficulties from a religious freedom perspective and founded The National Committee for Amish Religious Freedom (partly {{as a result of this}} case) and then provided them with legal counsel.|$|R
50|$|AWB members {{provided}} {{training to}} members of the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party <b>to</b> help them <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> against the ANC and fight for a Zulu homeland.|$|R
5|$|For Pellew, {{the victory}} was an {{encouraging}} {{sign of the}} weakness of the Dutch squadron. In October, Captain Peter Rainier seized another Dutch frigate from Batavia harbour itself and the following month Admiral Pellew led a large scale raid on the port that eliminated most of the Dutch East Indies squadron. Two ships of the line escaped Pellew's attack, but they were old and in a poor state of repair, and so were unable <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> when Pellew discovered and destroyed them at Griessie in 1807.|$|E
5|$|Predators of the {{red panda}} include the snow leopard, mustelids, and humans. If they feel {{threatened}} or sense danger, they may try to escape by climbing a rock column or tree. If {{they can no longer}} flee, they stand on their hind legs to make themselves appear larger and use the sharp claws on their front paws <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>themselves.</b> A red panda, Futa, became a visitor attraction in Japan for his ability to stand upright for ten seconds at a time.|$|E
5|$|Some plants, {{notably the}} grasses, use indigestible silica (and many plants use other {{relatively}} indigestible {{materials such as}} lignin) <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> against vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores. Plants take up silicon from the soil and deposit it in their tissues {{in the form of}} solid silica phytoliths. These mechanically reduce the digestibility of plant tissue, causing rapid wear to vertebrate teeth and insect mandibles, and are effective against herbivores above and below ground. The mechanism may offer future sustainable pest control strategies.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} criticized by many Latin American journalists' trade unions, who claim that it only {{represents}} {{the owners of the}} large media corporations, that it does not seem <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> journalists <b>themselves,</b> and that it is closely related to right-wing parties.|$|R
25|$|A {{consistent}} finding {{throughout the}} literature is {{that the majority of}} women arrested for IPV perpetration against male partners are victims using violence <b>to</b> resist and <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> against their batterers.|$|R
50|$|After {{four hours}} of fighting, Cáceres sensed victory. Gorostiaga's forces were reduced <b>to</b> <b>defending</b> <b>themselves</b> on their {{parapets}} {{at the very top}} of the Sazón. It was at that moment that the Peruvians started to run out of ammunition. Faced with this fact, Cáceres made a fatal mistake: he ordered his artillery to relocate to the valley facing the hill in order to provide the final coup. Gorostiaga saw this tactical error and ordered a cavalry charge by a squadron of the Cazadores a Caballo Cav. Regiment led by Sergeant Major Sofanor Parra. against the Peruvian guns. The defenceless artillery men were either dispersed or killed, the Peruvians losing seven cannons in the process.|$|R
5|$|Stalin's {{willingness}} to expend recently conscripted armies, which were poorly trained and poorly supplied, illustrated a misconception of realities, {{both in the}} capabilities of the Red Army and the subordinate arms of the armed forces, and in the abilities of the Germans <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> and successfully launch a counteroffensive. The latter proved especially true in the subsequent Case Blue, which led to the Battle of Stalingrad, though this was the battle in which Paulus faced an entirely different outcome.|$|E
5|$|Texas has a {{reputation}} of very harsh criminal punishment for criminal offenses. It {{is one of the}} 32 states that practice capital punishment, and since the US Supreme Court allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976, 40% of all US executions have taken place in Texas. As of 2008, Texas had the 4th highest incarceration rate in the US. Texas also has strong self defense laws, allowing citizens to use lethal force <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>themselves,</b> their families, or their property.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} a person prepares a weapon in order <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> against {{expected}} attack does not preclude the defense from being legitimate and, according to courts, {{it may not be}} expected from a defender to wait and rely on chance that a damage which is, both objectively and in the defender's subjective understanding, threatened to happen, will not take place. The defender may use proportionate accessible means in order to prevent an imminent attack and disarm the attacker.|$|E
50|$|During {{the absence}} of the militia, the women of the {{settlement}} and the few remaining men (one out of seven were drafted <b>to</b> stay behind) <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> from the Cherokee and British Indian agents.|$|R
5|$|Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick {{is based}} on a true story about a sperm whale that {{attacked}} and sank the whaleship Essex. Melville associated the sperm whale with the Bible's Leviathan. The fearsome reputation perpetuated by Melville was based on bull whales' ability <b>to</b> fiercely <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> from attacks by early whalers, occasionally resulting in the destruction of the whaling ships.|$|R
50|$|Aggregation allows {{caterpillars}} <b>to</b> collectively <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> {{against the}} attacks of predators and parasitoids. Such defense may be passive or active. Passive modes of collective defense involve dilution effects since the mathematical probability that any one individual will be randomly singled out by a predator decreases with group size. Individuals also gain protection from predators by surrounding themselves with others.|$|R
5|$|The forts were {{positioned}} to defend harbours and anchorages, and designed both to focus artillery fire on enemy ships, {{and to protect}} the gunnery teams from attack by those vessels. Some, including the major castles, including the castles of the Downs in Kent, were intended to be self-contained and able <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> against attack from the land, while the smaller blockhouses were primarily focused on the maritime threat. Although there were extensive variations between the individual designs, they had common features and were often built in a consistent style.|$|E
5|$|The game {{world is}} {{presented}} in a horizontal wraparound and consists of three platforms which Jetman can manoeuvre onto. Jetman must assemble his rocket (which spawns in instalments scattered around the map), and then fill it with fuel before taking off to the next planet, where the procedure is broadly repeated. In addition, the player has <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> from the planet's aliens, and for bonus points collect valuable resources which occasionally fall from above.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{coronation}} {{and the establishment}} of Christian institutions would take two years. Internal conflicts persisted; during the spring or summer of 1251, Tautvilas and his remaining allies attacked Mindaugas's warriors and the Livonian Order's crossbow-men in Voruta Castle. The attack failed, and Tautvilas' forces retreated <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> in Tviremet Castle (presumed to be Tverai in Samogitia). Vykintas died in 1251 or 1252, and Tautvilas was forced to rejoin Daniel of Galicia.|$|E

5000|$|In April 2015, Kasich {{created the}} Ohio Collaborative Community-Police Advisory Board, a twelve-member board tasked (in {{conjunction}} with the Ohio Office of Criminal Justice Services and the Ohio Department of Public Safety) with developing statewide standards for the recruiting, hiring and screening of police officers, and {{for the use of}} force (including deadly force) by police. The advisory board, {{the first of its kind}} in Ohio, was also tasked by Kasich with developing [...] "model policies and best practice recommendations to promote better interaction and communication between law enforcement departments and their home communities." [...] In August 2015, the board issued its recommendations, which placed [...] "an emphasis on the preservation of human life and restrict officers <b>to</b> <b>defending</b> <b>themselves</b> or others from death or serious injury." ...|$|R
50|$|Six {{ships were}} {{initially}} planned {{to supply the}} Type 23 frigates in their North Atlantic anti-submarine role. The Type 23 {{was at the time}} planned to be a low cost, lightly armed vessel. The Fort-class ships were therefore expected <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> both <b>themselves</b> and the Type 23 frigates with the Sea Wolf vertical launch surface-to-air missile (SAM).|$|R
5|$|After the Taino victory {{the colonists}} formed a citizens' militia <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> against the attacks. Juan Ponce de León {{and one of}} his top commanders, Diego de Salazar led the Spaniards in a series of offensives which {{included}} a massacre of the Taino forces in the domain of Agüeybaná II. The Spanish offensive culminated in the Battle of Yagüecas against Cacique Mabodomoca. Agüeybaná II was shot and killed, ending the first recorded military action in Puerto Rico. After the failed rebellion, the Tainos were forced to give up their customs and traditions by order of a Royal decree, approved by King Ferdinand II, which required that they adopt and practice the values, religion and language of their conquerors.|$|E
5|$|Further, young giraffes {{are much}} more {{vulnerable}} to predation than adults: between 60% and 75% of calves die within a year. Mothers hide their calves, which spend {{much of the time}} lying down in cover. Since the presence of a mother does not affect survival, Mitchell suggests that young giraffes must be extremely well camouflaged. This is supported by the fact that coat markings are strongly inherited. Conversely, far from hiding, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> even from lions.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to this cancellation and rumors of an anti-Protestant alliance between Catholics and Native Americans, Protestant settlers formed an association <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>themselves.</b> In July 1689, they marched on the colonial capital, St. Mary's City. Led by John Coode, the Protestant associators were quickly able to capture St. Mary's and the other major towns of the colony. The Governor {{and a number of}} other Calvert allies fled to Virginia. Charles Calvert turned for relief to the Lords of Trade and eventually to the Privy Council, but these groups sided with the Protestants and took away the power of the Calvert family to govern the colony. Soon thereafter, the new leaders of the colony barred Catholics from holding office, bearing arms, or serving on juries.|$|E
50|$|Lyons was {{initially}} {{supportive of the}} Soviet regime and found its repressive actions credible. He covered the 1928 Shakhty Trial of mining engineers, regarded by historians today a precursor to the show trials of the late 1930s. Lyons saw that the trial was unfair and that the accused were denied an opportunity <b>to</b> fully <b>defend</b> <b>themselves.</b> But he still believed {{that they must be}} guilty of something.|$|R
50|$|Since the school-shooting {{incident}} in Columbine {{there has been}} greater emphasis on stopping acts of school-yard bullying. Many educational institutions {{around the world have}} implemented anti-bullying campaigns with great success. In each of these campaigns it is common to find {{at least one of the}} anti-bullying tactics specifically addressing the need for victims of bullying to say something as a way <b>to</b> verbally <b>defend</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|R
50|$|With {{attempts}} at a peaceful compromise unsuccessful, local IWW leader Britt Smith pressed Elmer Smith for additional advice. Elmer Smith {{agreed that it}} would be legal for the Wobblies <b>to</b> physically <b>defend</b> <b>themselves,</b> but, as he later testified, only in self-defense if attacked first. The IWW members interpreted this legal advice as justification to arm themselves for what they perceived as an inevitable and dangerous confrontation.|$|R
