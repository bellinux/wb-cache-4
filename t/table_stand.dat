60|$|Whilst {{the ladies}} were {{carrying}} on their conversation, Amelia's constant escort, the Major (who, of course, {{did not wish}} to interrupt their conference, and found himself rather tired of creaking about the narrow stair passage of which the roof brushed the nap from his hat) descended to the ground-floor of the house and into the great room common to all the frequenters of the Elephant, out of which the stair led. This apartment is always in a fume of smoke and liberally sprinkled with beer. On a dirty <b>table</b> <b>stand</b> scores of corresponding brass candlesticks with tallow candles for the lodgers, whose keys hang up in rows over the candles. Emmy had passed blushing through the room anon, where all sorts of people were collected; Tyrolese glove-sellers and Danubian linen-merchants, with their packs; students recruiting themselves with butterbrods and meat; idlers, playing cards or dominoes on the sloppy, beery tables; tumblers refreshing during the cessation of their performances--in a word, all the fumum and strepitus of a German inn in fair time. The waiter brought the Major a mug of beer, as a matter of course, and he took out a cigar and amused himself with that pernicious vegetable and a newspaper until his charge should come down to claim him.|$|E
6000|$|The author's friend, Mr. Rokeby, lives, and {{has lived}} for some twenty years, {{in an old}} house at Hammersmith. It is {{surrounded}} by a large garden, the drawing-room and dining-room are on the right and left of the entrance from the garden, on the ground floor. My friends had never been troubled by any phenomena before, and never expected to be. However, they found the house [...] "noisy," [...] the windows were apt to be violently shaken at night and steps used to be heard where no steps should be. Deep long sighs were audible at all times of day. As Mrs. Rokeby approached a door, the handle would turn and the door fly open. {196} Sounds of stitching a hard material, and of dragging a heavy weight occurred in Mrs. Rokeby's room, and her hair used to be pulled in a manner for which she could not account. [...] "These sorts of things went on for about five years, when in October, 1875, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was sitting" [...] (says Mrs. Rokeby) [...] "with three of my children in the dining-room, reading to them. I rang the bell for the parlour-maid, when the door opened, and on looking up I saw the figure of a woman come in and walk up {{to the side of the}} <b>table,</b> <b>stand</b> there a second or two, and then turn to go out again, but before reaching the door she seemed to dissolve away. She was a grey, short-looking woman, apparently dressed in grey muslin. I hardly saw the face, which seemed scarcely to be defined at all. None of the children saw her," [...] and Mrs. Rokeby only mentioned the affair at the time to her husband.|$|E
6000|$|Yes, my friends, {{this is our}} gospel, {{our good}} news, {{that there is a}} God whose Spirit strives with sinners to change them into His own likeness. A God who is no dark, obstinate, inexorable Fate, whose {{arbitrary}} decrees must come to pass; but a loving and merciful God, long-suffering, and who repenteth Him of the evil; who repents Him of the evil which is in man, and hates it, and has sworn to Himself to fight against it, till He has put all enemies under His foot, and cast out of His kingdom all things which offend. Who repents Him of the evil in man: but who will never again repent Him of having made man, for then He would repent of having become man; He would repent of having been conceived of the Holy Ghost; He would repent of having been born of the Virgin Mary; He would repent of having been crucified, dead, and buried; He would repent of having risen from the dead, and ascended up into heaven in His man's body, and soul, and spirit; He would repent of sitting on the right hand of God; He would repent of coming to judge the quick and the dead; He would repent of having done His Father's will on earth, even as He did it from all eternity in the bosom of the Father. For He is a man; and even as the reasonable soul and body are one man, so God and man are one Christ. As man, He did His Father's will in Judaea of old; as man, He will judge the world; as man He rules it now; as man, St. John saw Him fifty years after He ascended to heaven, and His eyes were like a flame of fire, and His hair like fine wool, and He was girt under the bosom with a golden girdle, and His voice was like the sound of many waters; as man, He said: [...] "Fear not: I am the first and the last; I am He that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of death and hell." [...] Yes. This is the gospel, the good news for fallen man, that there is a Man {{in the midst of the}} throne of God, to whom all power is given in heaven and earth; that the fate of the world, and all that is therein--the fate of suns and stars--the fate of kings and nations--the fate of every publican and harlot, and heathen and outcast--the fate of all who are in death and hell, depends alike upon the sacred heart of Jesus; the heart which groaned at the tomb of Lazarus His friend; the heart which wept over Jerusalem; the heart which said to the blessed Magdalene, the woman who was a sinner: [...] "Go in peace; thy sins are forgiven thee;" [...] the heart which now yearns after every sinful and wandering soul in His church, and all over the earth of God, crying to you all: [...] "Why will ye die? Have I any pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord, and not rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live? Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest." [...] Oh, my friends, wonderful as my words are--as wonderful to me who speak them as they can be to you who hear them--yet they are true. True; for on that <b>table</b> <b>stand</b> the bread and wine whereof He Himself said, standing upon this very earth which He Himself had made: [...] "This is my body which is given for you; this cup is the new covenant in my blood, which I will give for the life of the world." ...|$|E

Particularly with the ancillary menu types, the menu may be provided in alternative formats, because these menus (other than wine lists) tend to be much shorter than food menus. For example, an appetizer menu or a dessert menu may be displayed on a folded paper table tent, a hard plastic <b>table</b> <b>stand,</b> a flipchart style wooden [...] "table stand," [...] or even, {{in the case of a}} pizza restaurant with a limited wine selection, a wine list glued to an empty bottle.|$|E

40|$|A satire on {{the presidential}} contest of 1836, using the metaphor of a billiards game between Whig {{candidate}} William Henry Harrison (left) and Democrat Martin Van Buren. The artist is clearly {{on the side of}} Harrison, whom he places beneath a portrait of George Washington, in opposition to Van Buren's perceived mentor and champion Andrew Jackson who stands {{at the far end of}} the table, below a painting of Napoleon. Behind the <b>table</b> <b>stand</b> Whig Senators Daniel Webster and Henry Clay, arm-in-arm near Harrison. Next to Van Buren (holding a cue) stands a sixth man, either Secretary of the Treasury Levi Woodbury or (as Weitenkampf suggests) Van Buren ally Senator Thomas Hart Benton. Harrison: "Now for a six stroke. " Webster: "Now's your chance Harrison. There is a tide in the affairs of men as Shakespear says. " Clay: "I'll go a cool Hundred Harrison wins the game. " Sixth man: "I'll bet a cookie he don't make the hazzard. " Jackson (holding what appears to be a bridge) : "By the Eternal!

40|$|The {{technique}} of raking light consists of illuminating objects at an oblique angle from a light source {{that is very}} close to the surface. By using raking light, the details of brushstrokes and the surface texture of a painting is accentuated, both by the increased illumination of surfaces facing the light source, and the exaggerated shadows of non-illuminated surfaces. This sort of method provides useful information about the surface topography and relief of the artefact, and that is why it is widely used in the examination of works of art. Furthermore, raking light can help to emphasize various painting techniques, and can for example, assist conservators through non-invasive examination of artworks. It also may be useful in order to monitor the effects of conservation interventions. In the context of recent developments in additive layer manufacturing and projects investigating the application of contemporary texture to surfaces or construction of surface topology, paintings can be considered as a three-dimensional landscape, although composition and colour are key components of an artwork, texture is also vital, as it provides an unique ‘fingerprint’ of an artwork’s surface) [1]. In this paper, an alternative approach is presented, starting with an illuminated dome that is attached to a stereo-microscope, which is able to gain - at the same time - both colour and texture features of the sample. By using a stereo-microscope, a more detailed observation is possible. Important elements including colour, texture, the morphology of the sample surface, in terms of specular and diffused components of reflected light, can be summarized/condensed in the measure of Bidirectional Texture Function [2]. The whole apparatus consists of an enclosed rotating dome in which is placed the sample, which must be of reduced size or, however, easy to handle (for example, a sheet of paper). A closed hemispherical covering, approximately 20 cm high, is placed above the sample, in order to guarantee a “micro-environment” with a constant geometry of illumination and observation of the sample. On the external shell of the dome a hole is present, through which a light source is inserted, a small lambertian bright 0. 5 W LED lamp (6000 k) illuminates the sample surface at a fixed angle. The dome is rotated around the sample so that the sample is illuminated from different directions. By rotating the dome, it is possible to obtain both single pictures and a 360 degree rotating view. In order to provide {{a better understanding of the}} relationship between ink or paint on the different substrates, the samples are examined under a stereo-microscope. The samples are captured using a Nikon SMZ 800 stereo zoom microscope with a P-ED Plan 0. 5 x objective, attached to a G-US 2 universal <b>table</b> <b>stand</b> so that a range of samples can be examined. Nikon Elements software can be used as both a visualisation and measuring tool. Images obtained will emphasize the threedimensionality of every smallest detail, of a single brushstroke, making it possible to digitally reconstruct the surface. This method would be useful in order to better characterize the sample with its colorimetric and texture features, then it would allow an easier digital reconstruction of the sample and, thus, a more simple reproducibility by printing. Furthermore, for restorers involved in a conservative intervention, it could be a useful way to monitor their work and to provide a feedback, that is, a scientific basis for the subsequent steps.

40|$|Abstract [...] <b>Stand</b> <b>tables</b> provide {{number of}} trees per acre for each {{diameter}} class. This paper presents a general technique to predict a future <b>stand</b> <b>table,</b> {{based on the}} current <b>stand</b> <b>table</b> and future <b>stand</b> summary statistics such as trees and basal area per acre, and average diameter. The stand projection technique involves (a) predicting surviving trees for each class, and (b) growing tree diameters such that the <b>stand</b> <b>table</b> {{at the end of}} the growth period produces future stand summaries identical to those mentioned above. Linear and nonlinear diameter growth models produced similar results. The <b>stand</b> <b>table</b> projection approach was as good as the parameter-recovery Weibull model for unimodal distributions, and out-performed the Weibull when diameter distributions were bimodal or irregular...|$|R
