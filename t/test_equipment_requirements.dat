40|$|Software for {{automated}} test equipment can be tedious and monotonous making {{it just as}} error-prone as other software. Active defect prevention and detection are also important for test applications. Incomplete or unclear requirements, a cryptic syntax used for some test applications—especially script-based test sets, variability in syntax or structure, and changing requirements are among the problems encountered in one tester. Such problems are common to all software but can be particularly problematic in test equipment software intended to test another product. Each of these issues increases the probability of error injection during test application development. This report describes a test application development tool designed {{to address these issues}} and others for a particular piece of test equipment. By addressing these problems in the development environment, the tool has powerful built-in defect prevention and detection capabilities. Regular expressions are widely used in the development tool as a means of formally defining <b>test</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>requirements</b> for the test application and verifying conformance to those requirements. A novel means of using regular expressions to perform range checking was developed. A reduction in rework and increased productivity are the results. These capabilities are described along with lessons learned and their applicability to other test equipment software. The test application development tool, or “application builder”, is known as the PT 3800 AM Creation, Revision and Archiving Tool (PACRAT) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Measuring hillslope erosion has {{historically}} been a costly, time-consuming practice. An easy to install low-cost technique using silt fences (geotextile fabric) and tipping bucket rain gauges to measure onsite hillslope erosion was developed and <b>tested.</b> <b>Equipment</b> <b>requirements,</b> installation procedures, statistical design, and analysis methods for measuring hillslope erosion are discussed. The use of silt fences is versatile; various plot sizes {{can be used to}} measure hillslope erosion in different settings and to determine effectiveness of various treatments or practices. Silt fences are installed by making a sediment trap facing upslope such that runoff cannot go around the ends of the silt fence. The silt fence is folded to form a pocket for the sediment to settle on and reduce the possibility of sediment undermining the silt fence. Cleaning out and weighing the accumulated sediment in the field can be accomplished with a portable hanging or platform scale at various time intervals depending on the necessary degree of detail in the measurement of erosion (that is, after every storm, quarterly, or seasonally). Silt fences combined with a tipping bucket rain gauge provide an easy, low-cost method to quantify precipitation/hillslope erosion relationships. Trap efficiency of the silt fences are greater that 90 percent efficient, thus making them suitable to estimate hillslope erosion...|$|R

In this paper, the test benches defined for design validation or characterization of AMS & RF SoCs are first optimized and then re-used for production testing.

We propose, in contrast to previous work that addresses one or few of the problems, an integrated framework with heuristics for sharing and compression and a Constraint Logic Programming technique for architecture design and test scheduling that minimizes the TAT without violating a given ATE memory constraint.

40|$|With {{the growing}} {{complexity}} of Wireless Systems on Chip integrating hundred-of-million transistors, electronic design methods {{need to be}} upgraded to reduce time-tomarket. In this paper, the test benches defined for design validation or characterization of AMS & RF SoCs are optimized and re-used for production testing.

The choice of functional or behavioral abstraction levels is discussed by comparing their impact on structural fault coverage. Experiments are performed on the receiver part of a WCDMA transceiver. Results show that for this SoC, using behavioral abstraction level is justified for the generation of manufacturing test benches. I...|$|R

40|$|There {{are various}} occurrences and root causes {{that result in}} no-fault-found (NFF) events but an {{intermittent}} fault (IF) is the most frustrating. This paper describes the challenging and most important area of an IF detection and health monitoring that focuses toward NFF situation in electronics interconnections. The experimental work focuses on mechanically-induced intermittent conditions in connectors. This paper illustrates a test regime, {{which can be used}} to repeatedly reproduce intermittence in electronic connectors, while subjected to vibration. A novel algorithm is used to detect an IF in interconnection. It sends a sine wave and decodes the received signal for intermittent information from the channel. This algorithm has been simulated to capture an IF signature using PSpice (electronic circuit simulation software). A simulated circuit is implemented for practical verification. However, measurements are presented using an oscilloscope. The results of this experiment provide an insight into the limitations of existing <b>test</b> <b>equipment</b> and <b>requirements</b> for future IF detection techniques. Aside from scheduled maintenance, this paper considers the possibility for in-service intermittent detection to be built into future systems, i. e., can IFs be captured without external test gear...|$|R
40|$|The current {{success of}} {{smartphones}} and the relentless trend to reduce cost and add capabilities every year are key drivers in the wireless semiconductor business. Combining various RF technologies into one device {{along with the}} desire for multi-site testing can easily increase the RF ATE test fixture port count {{to a range of}} 48 and beyond. While a few ATE vendors provide <b>test</b> <b>equipment</b> for this <b>requirement,</b> the question remains on how to manage the interfacing and the test fixture design for high density RF without losing performance. The current interfacing and layout paradigm will undergo a significant change. The RF connectors are moved further away from the DUT to allow easier assembly and debugging, but with higher risk of performance degradation due to loss, crosstalk and interference. This paper evaluates new hardware and layout techniques, discusses mechanical, performance and crosstalk requirements that need to be applied and describes the consequences this will have for loadboard design. 1...|$|R
40|$|Intermittent faults in electrical/electronic {{interconnections}} are recognised {{as one of}} {{the major}} sources of No Fault Found (NFF) events. These can be caused due to surface corrosion (e. g. oxidation of pins or fretting wear), bent pins, debris within the female connector, or incorrect installation during initial manufacture and assembly. Unless such issues are narrowed down to a specific root cause, any corrective actions or troubleshooting will be difficult to carry out, and hence its resolution may not make its way into future designs of the system. This leads to further susceptibility to NFF. Intermittent behaviour is often a clear sign of a partially damaged connector, or a connector undergoing a particular degradation mechanism, with the level of intermittency being further aggravated through process variation of harsh environments and parametric faults. In order to further our understanding of the relationship between degradation, operating conditions, intermittent behaviour within the subject, an experimental investigations have been carried out. This paper {{is a work in progress}} paper that illustrates a test regime that has been used to stimulate intermittence in electronic connectors whilst subjected to vibration, using both a traditional oscilloscope and bespoke intermittent fault detection equipment, in order to capture an intermittent signature. The results of these experiments provide an insight into the limitations of <b>test</b> <b>equipment</b> and <b>requirements</b> for future intermittent fault detection techniques...|$|R
40|$|Testing is used {{to ensure}} {{production}} of high quality integrated circuits. High test quality implies the application of high quality test data; however, technology development {{has led to a}} need to increase test data volumes to ensure high test quality. The problem is that the high test data volume leads to long test application times and high automatic <b>test</b> <b>equipment</b> memory <b>requirement.</b> For a modular core-based system-on-chip, a test data truncation scheme is proposed, that selects test data for each module {{in such a way that}} the system test quality is maximised while the selected test data are guaranteed to overcome constraints on time and memory. For test data selection, a test quality metric is defined based on fault coverage, defect probability and number of applied test vectors, and a scheme that selects the appropriate number of test vectors for each core, based on the test quality metric, defines the test architecture and schedules the transportation of the selected test data volume on the test access mechanism such that the system's test quality is maximised. The proposed technique has been implemented, and the experimental results, produced at reasonable CPU times on several ITC' 02 benchmarks, show that high test quality can be achieved by careful selection of test data. The results indicate that the test data volume and test application time can be reduced to about 50 % while keeping a high test quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{semiconductor}} technology development {{makes it possible}} to fabricate increasingly advanced integrated circuits (ICs). However, because of imperfections at manufacturing, each individual IC must be tested. A major problem at IC manufacturing test is the increasing test data volume as it leads to high automatic <b>test</b> <b>equipment</b> (ATE) memory <b>requirement,</b> long test application time and low throughput. In contrast with existing approaches, which address either test data compression for ATE memory reduction or abort-on-fail testing for test time minimisation, an architecture that supports both test data compression and abort-on-fail testing at clock-cycle granularity is proposed, and hence both ATE memory reduction and test application time minimisation are addressed. Further, the proposed architecture efficiently tackles low throughput as the architecture allows multi-site testing at a constant ATE memory requirement, which is independent of the number of tested ICs. Advantages of the architecture, compared with test compression architecture, are that diagnostic capabilities are not reduced and {{there is no need for}} special handling of unknowns (X) in the produced test responses (PR). Experiments on ISCAS benchmark circuits and an industrial circuit have been performed...|$|R
