5|$|In May 1943, the Axis {{powers of}} Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy were {{defeated}} in the North African Campaign. Two months later, the Allied powers of Great Britain and the United States successfully launched their invasion of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky. The island being completely occupied {{by the end of}} August, the Allies next turned <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the invasion of Italy.|$|E
5|$|The region around Brough {{continued}} to be disputed between the kings of England and Scotland; in 1173, William the Lion of Scotland invaded {{as part of the}} Great Revolt against the rule of Henry II. William's army struck south but failed to take Wark and moved on to attack Carlisle instead; when that failed too, they successfully took Appleby before turning <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Brough.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the penalty was taken, the Welsh dugout was {{surrounded}} by press and photographers, as the home team were still leading 1–0. With the scores levelled, the pack switched <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the Scottish bench, which led to Stein remonstrating {{with at least one}} photographer {{to move out of the}} way of his view of the game. Both Professor Stewart Hillis, the Scotland team doctor (who was also Stein's consultant), and Welsh manager Mike England stated that there appeared to be nothing wrong at this point.|$|E
50|$|In 1980, and 1981, Sauber and Welti turned <b>their</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> {{developing}} BMW M1 sportscars, in {{the latter}} year it won the 1000km Nürburgring.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile, Stella {{was being}} engaged by the brother, who {{surveyed}} her with pale, admiring eyes {{which did not}} confine <b>their</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> the fichu.|$|R
50|$|Brutus and Cassius {{lost the}} twin battles of Philippi and {{committed}} suicide in 42 BC. After this, the triumvirs turned <b>their</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> Sicily and Sextus.|$|R
5|$|France officially {{entered the}} war on 17 June 1778, and the French ships sent to the Western Hemisphere {{spent most of the}} year in the West Indies, and only sailed to the Thirteen Colonies from July until November. In the first Franco-American campaign, a French fleet {{commanded}} by Vice-Admiral Comte Charles Henri Hector d'Estaing attempted landings in New York and Newport, but due to a combination of poor co-ordination and bad weather, d'Estaing and Vice-Admiral Lord Richard Howe naval forces did not engage during 1778. After the French fleet departed, the British turned <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the south. In 1779, the French fleet returned to assist American forces attempting to recapture Savannah from British forces.|$|E
5|$|In Hoysala art Hardy {{identifies}} two conspicuous {{departures from}} the more austere Western (Later) Chalukya art:ornamental elaboration and a profusion of iconography with figure sculptures, {{both of which are}} found in abundance even on the superstructure over the shrine. Their medium, the soft chlorite schist (Soapstone) enabled a virtuoso carving style. Hoysala artists are noted for <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> sculptural detail be it in the depiction of themes from the Hindu epics and deities or in their use of motifs such as yalli, kirtimukha (gargoyles), aedicula (miniature decorative towers) on pilaster, makara (aquatic monster), birds (hamsa), spiral foliage, animals such as lions, elephants and horses, and even general aspects of daily life such as hair styles in vogue.|$|E
5|$|Replying to the Wrights' letters, the U.S. {{military}} expressed {{virtually no}} interest in their claims. The brothers turned <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Europe, especially France, where enthusiasm for aviation ran high, and journeyed there {{for the first time}} in 1907 for face-to-face talks with government officials and businessmen. They also met with aviation representatives in Germany and Britain. Before traveling, Orville shipped a newly built Model A Flyer to France in anticipation of demonstration flights.|$|E
25|$|In 758, the Uyghurs turned <b>their</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> the {{northern}} Yenisei Kyrgyz. Bayanchur Khan destroyed several of their trading outposts before slaughtering a Kyrgyz army and executing their Khan.|$|R
50|$|Murphy's {{was heavily}} {{promoted}} worldwide by Heineken throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, but it ultimately failed to substantially dent Guinness' global stout market share, and Heineken have since directed <b>their</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> other brands.|$|R

5|$|The Maratha cannonade {{intensified}} as the British redeployed. Although British artillery {{was brought}} forward to counter, it was ineffective against the mass firepower of the Maratha guns and quickly disabled through {{the weight of}} shot directed against it. British casualties mounted as the Maratha guns turned <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the infantry and subjected them to a barrage of canister, grape and round shot. Wellesley decided that his only option to neutralise the artillery and get his men out of the killing field was to advance directly {{into the mouth of}} the Maratha artillery. He ordered his cannon to be abandoned and gave the command for his infantry to march forward with bayonets fixed.|$|E
5|$|The deputies turned <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Cripple Creek itself. They {{arrested and}} imprisoned {{hundreds}} of citizens without cause. Many {{inhabitants of the}} town were seized {{on the street or}} pulled from their homes, then clubbed, kicked or beaten. The deputies formed a gauntlet and forced townspeople to pass through it, spitting, slapping and kicking them. With Bull Hill in his possession, Gen. Brooks began detaining the deputies. By nightfall, Brooks had seized the town and corralled all of Bowers' men.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} takes a brief detour as Martin and Rustin direct <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> {{a five-year-old}} missing-persons case, {{a little girl}} named Marie Fontenot, after she was mentioned {{by one of the}} locals. Authorities believe she is in the care of her father, and during a visit to see her uncle Danny Fontenot (Christopher Berry), his caretaker echoed their beliefs. Rustin searches the property for potential evidence, and while in a shed, stumbles upon a twig sculpture eerily similar to those discovered at the Dora Lange murder scene.|$|E

5000|$|When {{one becomes}} distracted from the breath, {{which happens to}} both {{beginning}} and adept practitioners, either by a thought or something else, then one simply returns <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> back <b>to</b> the breath. Philippe Goldin has said that important [...] "learning" [...] occurs {{at the moment when}} practitioners turn <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> back <b>to</b> the object of focus, the breath.|$|R
50|$|Despite their {{historic}} enmity, the British and French eventually became strained political allies, as both began <b>to</b> turn <b>their</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> acquiring new territories beyond Europe. The British developed India and Canada and settled Australia, spreading their powers to several different continents as the Second British Empire.|$|R
5|$|The last Texian {{group to}} remain in the open were Crockett and his men, {{defending}} the low wall in front of the church. Unable to reload, they used their rifles as clubs and fought with knives. After a volley of fire and a wave of Mexican bayonets, the few remaining Texians in this group fell back towards the church. The Mexican army now controlled all of the outer walls and the interior of the Alamo compound except for the church and rooms along the east and west walls. Mexican soldiers turned <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> a Texian flag waving from the roof of one building. Four Mexicans were killed before the flag of Mexico was raised in that location.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial and}} {{execution}} of Riel caused a bitter and prolonged reaction which convulsed Canadian politics for decades. The Orange Irish Protestant element in Ontario had demanded the execution as the punishment for Riel's treason and his execution of Thomas Scott in 1870. With their revenge satisfied, the Orange turned <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> other matters (especially the Jesuit Estates proposal). In Quebec there was no forgetting, and the politician Honoré Mercier rose to power by mobilizing the opposition in 1886.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor {{learning}} outcomes because they take {{up some of}} the limited space in working memory. The experiment compared people's ability to control <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low working memory capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low working memory looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working memory capacity. It could be argued that differences in performance between high- and low- working memory capacity individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with working memory capacity in other studies.|$|E
50|$|Their {{aspirations}} were {{to see a}} truly {{local radio}} service for their home area. Disillusioned by events in the Leicestershire radio market and the subsequent collapse of Centre Radio, the group turned <b>their</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> building <b>their</b> individual careers, although maintaining their strong interest in local radio.|$|R
50|$|Stone Age Cartoons is a 1940 American {{series of}} 12 {{animated}} short films from Fleischer Studios. The films {{are set in}} a stone-age time much like 1960s series The Flintstones. When they {{did not get the}} anticipated reception, Fleischer turned <b>their</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> the Gabby Color Cartoons.|$|R
25|$|Jahan's eldest daughter, the devoted Jahanara Begum Sahib, {{gradually}} {{brought him}} out of grief and fulfilled the functions of Mumtaz at court. Immediately after the burial in Burhanpur, Jahan and the imperial court turned <b>their</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> the planning and design of the mausoleum and funerary garden in Agra.|$|R
5|$|Although heavily outnumbered, the 27th Brigade {{held their}} {{positions}} into the afternoon before the Australians were finally withdrawn to {{positions in the}} rear of the brigade, with both sides having suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese then turned <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the Canadians on Hill 677, but during a fierce night battle they were unable to dislodge them. The fighting helped blunt the Chinese offensive and the actions of the Australians and Canadians at Kapyong were important in assisting to prevent a breakthrough on the United Nations Command central front, and ultimately the capture of Seoul. The two battalions bore the brunt of the assault and stopped an entire Chinese division during the hard fought defensive battle. The next day the Chinese withdrew back up the valley, in order to regroup. Today, the battle is regarded as one of the most famous actions fought by the Australian and Canadian armies in Korea.|$|E
5|$|Argentina, {{like many}} other countries, entered into a {{recession}} following the beginning of World War I as international flows of goods, capital and labour declined. Foreign investment in Argentina came to a complete standstill from which it never fully recovered: Great Britain had become heavily indebted to the United States {{during the war and}} would never again export capital at a comparable scale. And after the opening of the Panama canal in 1914, Argentina and the other Southern cone economies declined, as investors turned <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Asia and the Caribbean. The United States, which came out of the war a political and financial superpower, especially perceived Argentina (and to a lesser extent Brazil) as a potential rival on world markets. Neither the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange nor the private domestic banks developed rapidly enough to fully replace British capital.|$|E
5|$|Domain-general views {{have been}} criticized for not fully {{explaining}} how children manage to avoid mapping errors when there are numerous possible referents to which objects, actions, or events might point. For instance, if biases are not present from birth, why do infants assume that labels refer to whole objects, instead of salient parts of these objects? However, domain-general perspectives do not dismiss the notion of biases. Rather, they suggest biases develop through learning strategies instead of existing as built-in constraints. For instance, the whole object bias could be explained as a strategy that humans use to reason about the world; perhaps we are prone to thinking about our environment in terms of whole objects, and this strategy is not specific to the language domain. Additionally, children may be exposed to cues associated with categorization by shape early in the word learning process, which would draw <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> shape when presented with novel objects and labels. Ordinary learning could, then, lead to a shape bias.|$|E
50|$|Malshanger FC were a {{successful}} village side who originally began their existence as a Sunday {{side in the}} Basingstoke League.

50|$|Interest in Silius mostly {{vanished}} in the 19th century. As for visual arts, Raphael's Vision of the Knight is a treatment of Silius' choice of Scipio. Despite Silius' poor reputation, classical scholars with their {{renewed interest in}} later Imperial epic seem to be finally turning <b>their</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> Silius' poetry.|$|R
5|$|In 1230 the Teutonic Knights, a crusading {{military}} order, {{moved to}} Chełmno Land and launched the Prussian Crusade against the pagan Prussian clans. With {{support from the}} pope and Holy Roman Emperor, the Teutons conquered and converted the Prussians by the 1280s and shifted <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the pagan Grand Duchy of Lithuania. For about 100 years the Knights raided Lithuanian lands, particularly Samogitia, as it separated the Knights in Prussia from their branch in Livonia. While the border regions became an uninhabited wilderness, the Knights gained very little territory. The Lithuanians first gave up Samogitia during the Lithuanian Civil War (1381–1384) in the Treaty of Dubysa. The territory {{was used as a}} bargaining chip to ensure Teutonic support for one of the sides in the internal power struggle.|$|E
5|$|Sanger {{returned}} to the United States in October 1915. She planned to open a birth control clinic modeled on the world's first such clinic, which she had visited in Amsterdam. She first had to fight the charges outstanding against her.Kennedy, p. 77. Noted attorney Clarence Darrow offered to defend Sanger free of charge but, bowing to public pressure, the government dropped the charges early in 1916.Sanger, Autobiography, pp. 183–189.Engelman, p. 61–62: Sanger also gained sympathy from the public when her five-year-old daughter died immediately before the trial. No longer under the threat of jail, Sanger embarked on a successful cross-country speaking tour, which catapulted her into {{the leadership of the}} U.S. birth control movement. Other leading figures, such as William J. Robinson and Mary Dennett, chose to work in the background, or turned <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> other causes. Later in 1916, Sanger traveled to Boston to lend her support to the Massachusetts Birth Control League and to jailed birth control activist Van Kleeck Allison.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the crime scene in Idaho and meet Detective Yale Abbott. He says they are less sure that the bites were made by a human and draws <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the strange footprint, believing that wild animals fed on the bodies after the fact. Scully points out {{that there is only one}} footprint, which looks ominously human, and that if it were left by an animal there would be more {{footprints}} leading to the bodies. Scully and Doggett check out the house and find prints leading upstairs and into the attic. Inside, Scully and Doggett find the missing fingers of the undertaker. They look like they have been regurgitated by something and the claw marks in the attic suggest something was hanging from the rafters. Meanwhile, elderly Mrs. McKesson is killed in her attic while looking at a photo album.|$|E

The ascent {{in a period of}} 3 years has been planned (2010) and to accomplish it the club has turned <b>their</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> the young players in the smaller categories sub-13 and sub-15.|$|R
50|$|Charles' reign {{was marked}} by {{internal}} and external strife, caused primarily by the constant plundering of Norman raiders on the northern French coast. These attacks had intensified as the aggressors, no longer content to pillage the coastline, had moved <b>their</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> cities and towns along the rivers. The Carolingian world was unable to effectively deal with these external threats.|$|R
50|$|Along the way, {{two young}} teachers, Susan and Colin, who are helping Mrs. Kay supervise, must also {{deal with the}} fact that Digga and Reilly have a crush on Susan while two older girl {{students}} have a crush on Colin.
