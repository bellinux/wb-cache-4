6000|$|The advance from a {{personal}} acquaintance with the elder Mr Chivery to an introduction to his amiable wife and disconsolate son, may have been easy; but easy or not, Mr Pancks soon made it. He nestled in the bosom of the tobacco business within {{a week or two}} after his first appearance in the College, and particularly addressed himself to the cultivation of a good understanding with Young John. In this endeavour he so prospered as to lure that pining shepherd forth from the groves, and tempt him to undertake mysterious missions; on which he began to disappear at uncertain intervals for as long a space as two or three days together. The prudent Mrs Chivery, who wondered greatly at this change, would have protested against it as detrimental to the Highland <b>typification</b> on the doorpost but for two forcible reasons; one, that her John was roused to take strong interest in the business which these starts were supposed to advance--and this she held to be good for his drooping spirits; the other, that Mr Pancks confidentially agreed to pay her, for the occupation of her son's time, at the handsome rate of seven and sixpence per day. The proposal originated with himself, and was couched in the pithy terms, 'If your John is weak enough, ma'am, not to take it, that is no reason why you should be, don't you see? So, quite between ourselves, ma'am, business being business, here it is!' ...|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{contemporary}} North American culture's reliance on the gender <b>typifications</b> that females are nurturing, sexually passive, and frequent victims of abuse, and that males are assertive, sexually aggressive, and frequent perpetraturs of abuse, {{people are more likely}} to perceive of females in the role of sexual abuse victims and males in the role of sexual abuse perpetrators. Furthermore, males are assumed to enjoy or profit from any form of sexual contact with females, and females are assumed to be incapable of causing harm through coercive sexual contact. This study demonstrates that such gender <b>typifications</b> overlook other "atypical" or "deviant" realities, namely the reality where females are perpetrators of sexual abuse and males or females are their victims. Moreover, the experiences of victims of sexual abuse by females clearly defy conventional gender <b>typifications.</b> Their reported experiences reveal that females can he perpetrators of sexual abuse, males can be sexually victimized by females, males do not enjoy or profit from coerced sexual contact with females, and that there can be varying degrees of psychological harm following coerced sexual contact with a female. Finally, this study reveals that there are consequences to opposing gender <b>typifications.</b> The survivors of sexual abuse in this study faced negative consequences as {{a result of}} reporting a reality that defied the "typical". Participants maintained that professionals, be they, police officers, child protection agents and mental health professionals, responded to their claims of sexual abuse with shock, disbelief, and denied their victimization and injury as a result of the gender of their sexual abuse perpetrator. Professionals often renegotiated the behaviours of alleged female perpetrators so that they were more consistent with conventional gender roles. According to respondents, the responses of professionals' heightened their feelings of self-blame, denial, resignation, anger and helplessness. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

50|$|Moral {{entrepreneurs}} {{are critical for}} moral emergence because they call attention to issues or even 'create' issues by using language that names, interprets, and dramatizes them. Typifying is a prominent rhetorical tool employed by moral entrepreneurs when attempting to define social problems. <b>Typification</b> is when claimsmakers characterize a problem's nature which is most commonly done by suggesting that a problem is best understood from a particular perspective (i.e. medical, moral, criminal, political, etc.) Therefore, moral entrepreneurs often engage in <b>typification</b> by claiming that certain behaviors or groups are acting in morally dangerous ways. Moral {{entrepreneurs are}} more successful at defining deviance when they can identify an entire group with a particular behavior and create fear that the behavior represents a danger {{not only to the}} group but also to the rest of society. Through <b>typification</b> {{and the creation of a}} dangerous class, moral entrepreneurs aim to place the activities of a particular group on the public's agenda and label certain actions as social problems.|$|E

40|$|Navigating {{transitions}} between {{planned and}} unexpected events {{is a familiar}} challenge for organizations, and yet {{little is known about}} the sensemaking processes by which organizational members coordinate action to fit unexpected events within temporally defined plans and schedules. Drawing on an ethnographic study conducted at a local U. S. television station (codenamed “Local TV”), we elaborate on how workers in the news department plan their stories on a daily basis and adjust their plans when new stories break. We find that newsmaking is shaped by expectancy frameworks, which define the baseline of what is expected to occur during the news day, and <b>typifications,</b> which allow newsworkers to categorize incoming events based on relevance and update expectancy frameworks accordingly. Taken together, these provide newsworkers with sensemaking resources for responding regularly to unexpected events. Our study contributes to the understanding of sensemaking processes in three main areas: the effect of time-based dynamics on the control and coordination of work, the interaction of routine and mindful processes in response to unexpected events, and the structural influences of expectations and <b>typifications</b> on sensemaking. ...|$|R

40|$|Our {{theories}} of court decision-making suggest that {{young women are}} perceived differently than young male offenders’ perceptions that may result in differential sentencing practices. The main focus of much work on gender and juvenile justice has been the concept of paternalism (i. e. the court acts in a “parental” role, providing punishment or leniency, depending {{on the extent to}} which female offenders have violated stereotypes of traditional femininity). However, the story is more complicated than suggested by paternalistic justice explanations. Motivated by research on the use of <b>typifications</b> by professionals, this study argues that the work of court officials involves a search for meaning about behaviour and its risk of reoccurrence. Part of this search is the development of <b>typifications,</b> or clusters of characteristics and factors, about offenders and their offences. Court officials draw on these categorizations of juvenile offenders to explain and justify their assessments and recommendations. Using data from an urban juvenile court in Washington state (USA), this study explores the categories that probation officers use in assessing juvenile offenders, and how these characterisations may differ by gender. Factor analysis is used to determine the underlying dimensions of probation officers’ assessments of male and female juvenile offenders...|$|R
