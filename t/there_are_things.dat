500|$|GoldenEye 007 was {{developed}} by an inexperienced team; eight of its ten developers had never previously worked on video games. As programmer David Doak recalls, [...] "Looking back, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> I'd be wary of attempting now, but as none of the people working on the code, graphics, and game design had worked on a game before, there was this joyful naïveté." [...] Due {{to the success of}} Donkey Kong Country, GoldenEye 007 was originally suggested as a 2D side-scrolling platformer for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, but Martin Hollis, the director and producer of the game, proposed [...] "a 3D shooting game" [...] for Nintendo's in-development [...] "Ultra 64" [...] console.|$|E
500|$|In mid-2002, Slipknot went on hiatus {{because of}} {{internal}} conflicts, and band members focused on side projects. Vocalist Taylor and guitarist Root revived their band Stone Sour, drummer Jordison created Murderdolls with vocalist Wednesday 13, percussionist Crahan founded To My Surprise and DJ Wilson went solo as DJ Starscream. For a while, {{the future of}} Slipknot was uncertain and there was much speculation about whether {{there would be a}} third album, or if the split would become permanent. [...] "I don't have a problem with anyone in Slipknot," [...] Jordison protested. [...] "I've seen comments from Corey saying <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> to be resolved, but I have no fucking idea what he's talking about." ...|$|E
500|$|Up {{until the}} middle of 1991, Sega of America had been kept largely uninformed of the details of the project, without a {{functioning}} unit to test (although Sega of America was provided with preliminary technical documents earlier in the year). According to former Sega of America executive producer Michael Latham, [...] "When you work at a multinational company, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> that go well and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> that don't. They didn't want to send us working Sega CD units. They wanted to send us dummies and not send us the working CD units until the last minute because they were concerned about what we would do with it and if it would leak out. It was very frustrating." [...] Even though they were not provided a functioning unit, Latham and Sega of America vice president of licensing Shinobu Toyoda put together a functioning Sega CD by acquiring a ROM for the system and installing it in a dummy unit. Further frustrating the Sega of America staff was the construction of the add-on. [...] "The Mega-CD was designed with a cheap, consumer-grade audio CD drive, not a CD-ROM," [...] stated Scot Bayless, former Sega of America senior producer. [...] "Quite late in the run-up to launch, the quality assurance teams started running into severe problems with many of the units—and when I say severe, I mean units literally bursting into flames. We worked around the clock, trying to catch the failure in-progress, and after about a week we finally realized what was happening," [...] citing the need for game titles to utilize more time seeking data than the CD drive was designed to provide.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series creator Chris Carter and {{directed}} by Rob Bowman. Bowman was {{not a fan of}} the episode, saying [...] "The show proved to be much more difficult than I anticipated, and there wasn't enough time to shoot the show properly because we were so close to the Christmas break. I felt extremely pressured and frustrated, although <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> in it I love, particularly the banter between Mulder and Scully. But overall, I thought the show was very oblique. I don't feel that the characters ever {{knew what was going on}} and I don't think it is all that cool that kids are murdering people. I didn't feel like I was shooting an episode of the X-Files, and I think I let Chris Carter down a bit." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc. Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Kahn, Spears pitched him her {{original}} concept, which included all the main elements {{used in the}} final version. Spears thought of the video as a sequel to [...] "Toxic", as seen in her documentary , whereas Kahn approached it as [...] "a 2008 answer" [...] to the previous clip. He added that, [...] "'Toxic' was a crystallization of her career at that time, [...] There are elements and moments of that I felt could [...] improved. [...] {{is a bit more}} fashion-forward". About how the concept of the video related to their previous work, Kahn commented that [...] "It's just a great girl fantasy. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> she's really good at, like having a really natural knack for knowing what girls want. [...] It's a much more mature sound and much more mature lyrics, and she always has the greatest ideas. She's hyper-aware of pop culture".|$|E

500|$|Darabont wrote a 60-page pilot {{script for}} [...] "Days Gone Bye". His initial script for the episode was split {{in half and}} embellished. Darabont {{explained}} that he did this to [...] "slow the narrative down and dig into the characters more deeply, so it's not just plot-driven, event-driven stuff. You really want to drag these characters into the equation." [...] Darabont felt that instituting visual maneuvers would increase the surreal atmosphere of a scene. Upon reading the script, Kirkman thought that producers were consistent with his comic, adding that they could possibly improve his initial work. [...] "Reading that pilot was just a revelation. It's extremely faithful. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> that are so much like the comic, I can't really remember the nuance of what's different and what's not from the comic. He's definitely being more faithful than I expected, and everything that he's changing is brilliant. I couldn't be happier. I think the fans of the book are going to just love it." [...] The episode shares its name with volume one of the comic book series.|$|E
500|$|Actor Jim Beaver {{described}} Bobby as a [...] "rough but warmhearted" [...] working-class {{man with}} the outlook that [...] "sometimes <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> {{that need to be}} done and they're not fun to do, but they gotta be done anyway". When the [...] "usually level-headed" [...] hunter must use a wheelchair in the fifth season, he becomes [...] "frustrated and angry"; instead of being able to join the battles, he is [...] "stuck at home manning the telephones". This feeling of uselessness eventually leads to thoughts of suicide, though he deems himself too much of a coward to go through with it. On the situation, Beaver commented, [...] "Bobby lives in a world where all kinds of strange things are possible. Somewhere along the line, he has a hope that one of these strange, miraculous things might happen to him. I think he is also a realist. He understands that even when you have friends that come back from the dead, not everything that you want to happen is going to happen." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{continues}} the storyline of Tom and Lynette's separation. Huffman enjoyed her character's storyline, stating: [...] "I'm sure <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> {{that they knew}} the viewers want, which is for Tom and Lynette to get back together. But I do like that it's kind of {{up in the air}} and maybe they won't." [...] Doug Savant commented, [...] "For many years on this show, we knew that Tom and Lynette were the grounding force on the street. They were the couple that most resembled most couples in America. It just got to a point after so many years when [...] really wanted to explore the things that made this relationship work by first pulling it apart." [...] Both actors expressed their desire for the couple to reunite by the series' end. Charles Mesure made his debut as new neighbor Ben Faulkner, a self-made contractor and Renee's new love interest. According to Vanessa Williams, [...] "She’s working hard to make it happen and it’s not happening easily for her. And she’s not used to that and that’s where the comedy ensues and it gives her something to pursue." ...|$|E

500|$|Vampire Weekend {{concentrated}} {{their efforts}} on giving each recording [...] "warmth", feeling that modern digital recordings lacked the sound quality of older records. In {{an attempt to make}} the tracks sound less harsh, the band and their recording engineers used a spectrum analyzer, Sonnox SuprEsser and heavily automated EQs to edit out harsher, colder frequencies and soften the mix. Vampire Weekend painstakingly listened to the record several separate times using technology from standard commercial iPod earbuds to professional equipment to ensure the record sounded nice regardless of equipment the listener owned. Desiring to [...] "check the relative warmth levels", the engineers would [...] "go in and perform surgery and automate EQs" [...] {{in order to make the}} mixes listenable. The band felt the finished product was something of a third chapter and a continuation of material explored in their previous two efforts. [...] "We thought these three albums should look like they belong together on a bookshelf", said Batmanglij. [...] "We realized that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> connecting the songs across three albums, like an invisible hand was guiding us. It does feel like we've been able to create three distinct worlds for each album, and yet have them be interconnected." ...|$|E

2500|$|George Steiner is {{regarded}} as a polymath and often credited with recasting the role of the critic by exploring art and thought unbounded by national frontiers or academic disciplines. He advocates generalisation over specialisation, and insists that the notion of being literate must encompass knowledge of both arts and sciences.
