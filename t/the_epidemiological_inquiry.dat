40|$|Among the {{consequences}} of the epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza which affected Italy between 1999 and 2000 was an epidemic of Newcastle disease in northern and central Italy. It affected industrially reared poultry, dealer flocks and backyard flocks, with a total of 254 outbreaks notified up to December 31, 2000. Virological investigations yielded virulent isolates of Newcastle disease virus, which produced intracerebral pathogenicity indices ranging from 1. 6 to 2. 0 and which, {{on the basis of their}} monoclonal antibody binding patterns, could be classified as belonging to group C 1. The clinical, gross and microscopical findings were typical of Newcastle disease, and different avian species were susceptible to different degrees. Chickens and guinea fowl appeared to be the most susceptible, followed by pheasants, turkeys and ostriches. <b>The</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>inquiry</b> highlighted the crucial role of a broiler hatchery in initiating the epidemic, and of dealers in perpetuating it. The control measures imposed by Directive 92 / 66 /EEC are discussed with reference to the outbreaks in backyard flocks. NEWCASTLE disease is a viral infection of birds caused by an avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV- 1), which, together with the other eight APMV serotypes, has been placed in the genus Rubulavirus, subfamily Paramyxovirinae, family Paramyxoviridae, order Mononegavirales in the current taxonomy (Lamb and others 2000). It is highly contagious and can cause a very severe disease in susceptible birds, with mortality rates exceeding 50 per cent in chickens. For this reason it is included in List A of the Office International des Epizooties (OIE), and statutory measures for its control are implemented in the EU (CEC 1992). Italy has been experiencing an epidemic of Newcastle disease caused by the 'pigeon strain ' of avian paramyxovirus 1 (PPMV- 1) since 1981, an...|$|E

Serum samples of dogs from Bauru were positive, both for Leishmania spp. and for T. cruzi, showing high cross-reactions incidence, reinforcing the need of diagnosis confirmation by other tests.

40|$|Embodiment. This {{construct}} and process {{are central to}} ecosocial theory and <b>epidemiological</b> <b>inquiry.</b> Recognising that we, as humans, are simultaneously social beings and biological organisms, the notion of "embodiment" advances three critical claims: (1) bodies tell stories about—and cannot be studied divorced from—the conditions of our existence; (2) bodies tell stories that often—but not always—match people's stated accounts; and (3) bodies tell stories that people cannot or will not tell, either because they are unable, forbidden, or choose not to tell. Just as the proverbial "dead man's bones" do in fact tell tales, via forensic pathology and historical anthropometry, so too do our living bodies tell stories about our lives, {{whether or not these}} are ever consciously expressed.

40|$|The {{discipline}} of epidemiology, which holds major influence on public health policy {{as well as}} on clinical medical practice, has in recent decades to a large extent been concerned with the identification of factors and markers of risk for disease. Much health information and intervention is thus informed by a wealth of studies on a variety of risk factors, of which the individual is encouraged to keep informed and to be responsible about. Meanwhile, risk factor epidemiology has been subject to intense debate, both within and outside the discipline. The following review offers an overview of critical intradisciplinary debates. It then opens discussion on three partially overlapping areas where social theory has been called upon to contribute to <b>epidemiological</b> <b>inquiry,</b> namely analysis of macro-social determinants of health and disease, of categories of human difference and of embodiment.
