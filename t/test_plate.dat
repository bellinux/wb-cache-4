5|$|Newton (<b>test</b> <b>plate)</b> {{interferometry}} {{is frequently}} {{used in the}} optical industry for testing the quality of surfaces as they are being shaped and figured. Fig.13 shows photos of reference flats being used to check two test flats {{at different stages of}} completion, showing the different patterns of interference fringes. The reference flats are resting with their bottom surfaces in contact with the test flats, and they are illuminated by a monochromatic light source. The light waves reflected from both surfaces interfere, resulting in a pattern of bright and dark bands. The surface in the left photo is nearly flat, indicated by a pattern of straight parallel interference fringes at equal intervals. The surface in the right photo is uneven, resulting in a pattern of curved fringes. Each pair of adjacent fringes represents a difference in surface elevation of half a wavelength of the light used, so differences in elevation can be measured by counting the fringes. The flatness of the surfaces can be measured to millionths of an inch by this method. To determine whether the surface being tested is concave or convex with respect to the reference optical flat, any of several procedures may be adopted. One can observe how the fringes are displaced when one presses gently on the top flat. If one observes the fringes in white light, the sequence of colors becomes familiar with experience and aids in interpretation. Finally one may compare the appearance of the fringes as one moves ones head from a normal to an oblique viewing position. These sorts of maneuvers, while common in the optical shop, are not suitable in a formal testing environment. When the flats are ready for sale, they will typically be mounted in a Fizeau interferometer for formal testing and certification.|$|E

The <b>test</b> <b>plate</b> outperformed a solid metal plate of similar thickness, while weighing far less.

50|$|Exposure to {{repeated}} nuclear blasts raises {{the problem of}} ablation (erosion) of the pusher plate. Calculations and experiments indicated that a steel pusher plate would ablate less than 1 mm, if unprotected. If sprayed with an oil it would not ablate at all (this was discovered by accident; a <b>test</b> <b>plate</b> had oily fingerprints on it and the fingerprints suffered no ablation). The absorption spectra of carbon and hydrogen minimize heating. The design temperature of the shockwave, 67,000 °C, emits ultraviolet light. Most materials and elements are opaque to ultraviolet especially at the 340 MPa pressures the plate experiences. This prevents the plate from melting or ablating.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{investigation}} was the film boiling of liquid drops on a hot horizontal surface (the Leidenfrost Phenomenon). Using Gottfried and Bell 2 ̆ 7 s model of a Leidenfrost drop, the thickness of the vapor cushion beneath film boiling water drops, 6, was calculated over a range of <b>test</b> <b>plate</b> and drop temperatures. The results indicated that the vapor cushion thickness varied very slowly with <b>test</b> <b>plate</b> temperature and maintained a finite value at <b>test</b> <b>plate</b> temperatures where the Leidenfrost Phenomenon cannot be initiated. To experimentally verify this fact, a heat exchanger was fabricated to cool the hot <b>test</b> <b>plate</b> while water drops were film boiling on it. This revealed that the Leidenfrost state can be maintained down to an average <b>test</b> <b>plate</b> temperature of 54 C.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a comparison study of measuring the airtightness {{of a house}} sized test chamber using the novel pulse technique and the standard blower door method in a controlled environment.

40|$|As {{part of the}} “Ultrasonics as an Alternative to Radiography for Weld Inspection (UT/RT) Program”, an {{evaluation}} of computer-assisted ultrasonics was performed. Briefly, this evaluation consisted of inspecting 33 UT/RT <b>test</b> <b>plates,</b> 650 feet of welds being fabricated in new construction, and 542 inches of welds in overhaul. Eight Navy UT inspectors and one “experienced” operator of the computer-assisted ultrasonic system inspected the <b>test</b> <b>plates</b> using the P-scan system with a manual weld scanner. Additionally, the <b>test</b> <b>plates</b> were inspected by manual ultrasonics and radiography (using an Iridium source with Kodak type AA film). Reference 1 summarizes the procedures that were used for this work and reports on the detection and disposition reliability for these inspection techniques. The UT/RT Program indicated {{that the use of}} computer-assisted ultrasonics would offer several qualitative benefits over conventional ultrasonics, including: a more repeatable and reproducible inspection, less operator dependency, better evidence of weld coverage, the potential for improved consistency of length measurement, and an automatic, hard-copy record of the inspection. Furthermore, it was suggested that the use of computer-assisted ultrasonics performed with an automated scanner would offer potential gains in terms of reproducibility, economics and operator independency. Since only a manual weld scanner was evaluated for the UT/RT Program, it was necessary to evaluate the capabilities of an automated scanner. Therefore, the work reported herein was performed to determine the ability of an automated ultrasonic scanner to: (1) operate in a shipyard environment and (2) repeatably detect weld discontinuities...|$|R
