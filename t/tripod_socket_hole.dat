50|$|The {{original}} Leicaflex {{is readily}} identifiable from its CdS meter window and battery cover {{on the front}} of the prism housing just above the lens. It was offered in chrome and black enamel finishes, the latter being rare. The first series had a fan-shaped exposure counter window and a <b>tripod</b> <b>socket</b> attached by three screws, whereas the second series had a round exposure counter window, a <b>tripod</b> <b>socket</b> integrated in the bottom plate and a meter switch built in the advance lever. In use, the two series are virtually identical. 32,500 serial numbers were allotted to the original Leicaflex.|$|R
5000|$|Even point-and-shoot cameras usually {{include a}} <b>tripod</b> <b>socket.</b> A system camera {{includes}} {{at the very}} least a camera body and separate, interchangeable lenses, whence the alternative name interchangeable-lens camera (ILC). In addition it often includes: ...|$|R
50|$|Available shutter speeds were 1/1000 second through 10 seconds, with a 1/150 second X-sync {{speed and}} support for bulb exposure. There was no {{built-in}} flash, but a hot shoe on the top allowed an external flash to be attached. A <b>tripod</b> <b>socket</b> was provided.|$|R
50|$|Canon {{kept the}} Leica screw mount on the VT, and little else. They changed the film advance from a {{top-mounted}} knob to a bottom-mounted trigger. The <b>tripod</b> <b>socket</b> {{was moved to}} mount a trigger wind grip. They added a swing-open back making the camera easier to load than previous bottom loading Canons.|$|R
50|$|Tsankawi Dwelling with visible <b>socket</b> <b>holes</b> {{used to hold}} ceiling timbers. Since {{the time}} that the talus pueblos were inhabited, the masonry walls have collapsed. The only thing that remains are caves carved into the cliffs and <b>socket</b> <b>holes</b> which were used to support timbers for the roof. Where not exposed to the elements, the caves are {{blackened}} from fires used for cooking and for heat during the winter months.|$|R
5000|$|The camera's {{top plate}} has the {{manually}} set frame counter, the shutter release, the {{film rewind knob}} with film reminder dial, the exposure needle window, meter adjustment knob with EV and ASA/DIN scales, the film (advance) release button, the frame (counter) advance slider, and the accessory shoe. The bottom plate contains the <b>tripod</b> <b>socket,</b> the film advance lever, the back release latch, and the film rewind release button.|$|R
50|$|Hand Grip: The metal grip {{provides}} a secure hold. The <b>tripod</b> mounting <b>socket</b> is {{aligned with the}} optical axis and the battery can be replaced without removing the grip.|$|R
5000|$|A round socket {{used at the}} end of {{extension}} cables. This is {{also the}} same size and shape as the earlier variant of the regular plug, but there are no pins and the <b>socket</b> <b>holes</b> are on the side where the pins would otherwise be.|$|R
50|$|Major controls, {{including}} {{shutter release}} button, surrounding off/mode switch, film-speed/exposure-compensation dial and shutter speed dial {{are located on}} the right-hand side of the top plate, as seen from the rear, as is the LCD displaying he current frame count. The viewfinder is located on the upper left-hand side of the camera. The manual rewind button, release catch for the camera back and cable release socket are on the left-hand side of the camera. The lens mount release and frameline preview lever are located {{on the front of the}} camera. The bottom plate has the cover for the batteries and a <b>tripod</b> <b>socket.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On August 19, 2014, Nikon {{acknowledged}} {{a problem}} reported by some users, of bright spots appearing in long-exposure photographs {{as well as}} [...] "in some images captured at an Image area setting of 1.2× (30×20)." [...] Existing owners of D810 cameras were asked to visit a website to determine whether their camera could be affected, {{on the basis of}} serial numbers. Repairs would be made by Nikon free of charge. If bright spots still appear in images after servicing, Nikon recommends enabling Long exposure NR. Products already serviced have a black dot inside the <b>tripod</b> <b>socket.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{complete}} camera top, hinged at the front, is a flush {{cover with}} no protruding controls. When flipped open, it reveals the waist-level finder. On {{the right-hand side}} is the single-stroke wind-on lever with the manual reset frame counter on top, and next to it the remote-release-threaded shutter button. On the left-hand side is the rewind knob with a film reminder on top. When the top lid is fully opened, the large square magnifier swings up over the focusing screen. An action finder is also incorporated into the top cover. At the base are the ¼ inch <b>tripod</b> <b>socket,</b> the A/R (advance/rewind) switch, and a release button for the removable back.|$|R
50|$|Flashcubes and Magicubes look {{similar but}} are not interchangeable. Cameras {{requiring}} flashcubes have a round socket and a round hole for the flashcube's pin, while those requiring Magicubes have a round shape with protruding studs and a square <b>socket</b> <b>hole</b> for the Magicube's square pin. The Magicube socket {{can also be seen}} as an X, which accounts for its alternate name, the X-Cube.|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} used by both the brethren of the second abbey, a {{dependency}} of St. Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury, and as a parish church. <b>Socket</b> <b>holes</b> in the piers of the crossing suggest that, {{as well as a}} rood screen, there was a further screen dividing nave and crossing, such as still exists at Dunster in Somerset. This abbey surrendered during the dissolution in 1534.|$|R
25|$|Polarization is {{maintained}} by the shape, size, or position of plug pins and <b>socket</b> <b>holes</b> and <b>socket</b> recesses {{to ensure that a}} plug fits only one way into a socket. Lamps with screw bases will connect the shell of the lamp socket to the neutral conductor. Similarly, the single-pole switch of the appliance is connected in series with the energized wire. However, due to the uncertainty, in practice, of which conductor is the neutral, some appliances contain dual-pole switches which interrupt both conductors.|$|R
50|$|Adam is {{the larger}} of the two stones, {{weighing}} an estimated 62 tons, and along with three others formed a four-sided cove. Excavations carried out jointly by the Universities of Leicester, Newport and Southampton University of Southampton in 2000 revealed the <b>socket</b> <b>holes</b> for the other stones which were tightly placed close to Adam. The cove had been open on its south eastern side which faced towards the nearby South Street barrow 130m away. The other stones were destroyed in the post-medieval period by a local landowner.|$|R
50|$|Both {{varieties}} of this connector use two pins with centers spaced 19.0 mm apart. The 6 A variety has pins on the plug with a 4.0 mm diameter with the corresponding <b>socket</b> <b>holes</b> having {{a diameter of}} 4.5 mm. The corresponding dimensions on the 16 A are 4.8 mm and 5.5 mm respectively. Thus a 6 A plug fits into both {{varieties of}} this socket, but the 16 A plug does not fit into the 6 A socket. The 16 A socket will accept all group C plugs, but does not provide grounding.|$|R
50|$|The {{camera back}} is {{removable}} for changing film. A milled button {{next to the}} <b>tripod</b> <b>socket</b> rotates either way to lock the back, while in a position in between it is unlocked. The back comes off downwards as a single unit including the base-plate. A quite small film-pressure plate of thick glass is mounted {{on a piece of}} rubber foam on the back. Inside the camera, on the left-hand side, is the 35mm film cassette chamber, and to the right is the counter clockwise rotating film take-up drum. It has a narrow slit for the film leader, and it rotates freely whenever the small film rewind button on the top plate is depressed. No sprocket wheel is employed; instead, the film is pulled by, and wound onto the drum that always rotates the same angular amount for next picture frame. Acceptable frame spacing is accomplished by the large diameter take-up spool that reduces the effect of increasing spool diameter as more film is wound onto it.|$|R
50|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature is the}} {{combined}} wind-on and shutter release lever. It swings out forward 65 degrees and is operated by the index finger. In the stowed-away position, the shutter is cocked and the film wound on {{ready for the next}} picture. A small rocking lever in front of the accessory shoe serves as a shutter-release lock at this stage, it is disengaged by sliding it to the left-hand side. Depressing the lever releases the shutter and it relocates to the 65 degrees standoff position. Depressing the lever again cocks the shutter and winds on the film. At the camera base is a special flash sync connector protected by coin-operated O-ring sealed aluminium plug, as well as an automatic resetting frame counter, visible behind a glass window. No <b>tripod</b> <b>socket</b> is provided. A small rewind knob at the left-hand top is extended for easy access and to engage the film transport mechanism. No rewind release facility is required; a function that was later added to the Nikonos and marked R on the shutter-speed dial.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{limitations}} on using a combo keyboard amp {{as a small}} PA system. First, {{it is hard to}} elevate a keyboard amp's speaker the way most PA speakers can be raised up, using PA system speaker stands with a pole onto which most small- to mid-sized PA speaker enclosures can be mounted using their base-mounted metal <b>socket</b> (a <b>hole</b> in a metal plate). Elevating a PA speaker above the audience helps to ensure that the sound is dispersed to the whole audience; if a combo keyboard amp is used as a small PA, the keyboard amp is typically placed on the floor or raised a bit by placing it on a table. In this scenario, the sound produced by the keyboard amp would be absorbed by the first several rows of audience members, and people {{in the back of the}} venue might not be able to hear the performance. Second, most small, low-wattage keyboard amps do not produce enough volume to clearly project the lead vocals into the venue so that they are at the [...] "front of the mix", a sound preferred in many pop genres. For example, whereas a small PA system for a coffeehouse would typically have 100 watts, a small keyboard combo amp may only be rated at 20 watts. Third, while the vast majority of small PA systems come with two speaker cabinets, most combo keyboard amps have a single speaker cabinet. With two speaker cabinets, even if both are pointing straight out at the audience, this provides better coverage of the room; moreover, the two speaker cabinets can be angled outwards a bit, increasing the arc of coverage better for wide rooms.|$|R
5|$|A {{variety of}} other {{skeletal}} features are shared by dinosaurs. However, because they are either common to other groups of archosaurs or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are {{not considered to be}} synapomorphies. For example, as diapsids, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of temporal fenestrae (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group Archosauria, had additional openings in the snout and lower jaw. Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated scapula, or shoulder blade; a sacrum composed of three or more fused vertebrae (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in Herrerasaurus); and a perforate acetabulum, or hip <b>socket,</b> with a <b>hole</b> at the center of its inside surface (closed in Saturnalia, for example). Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the late Triassic are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature.|$|R

This posture is due to the development of a laterally facing recess in the pelvis (usually an open socket) and a corresponding inwardly facing distinct head on the femur. Their erect posture enabled early dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving, which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that surpassed those of [...] "sprawling" [...] reptiles. Erect limbs probably also helped support the evolution of large size by reducing bending stresses on limbs. Some non-dinosaurian archosaurs, including rauisuchians, also had erect limbs but achieved this by a [...] "pillar erect" [...] configuration of the hip joint, where instead of having a projection from the femur insert on a socket on the hip, the upper pelvic bone was rotated to form an overhanging shelf.|$|R
