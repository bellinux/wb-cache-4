5000|$|The Coefficients {{involved}} in the quadratic failure criterion are defined as follows:where , , , , , and [...] denote longitudinal tensile, longitudinal compressive, transverse tensile, transverse compressive, transverse (or <b>through-thickness)</b> shear, and in-plane shear strength of the fiber, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|APG is an {{anisotropic}} material with extremely high in-plane thermal conductivity (1,700 W/m-K {{at room temperature}} [...] ) and low <b>through-thickness</b> conductivity. Its laminate structure remains stable across a wide temperature range allowing it {{to be used in}} a variety of heat transfer applications. APG's conductivity generally increases as the temperature decreases, peaking at 2,800 W/m-K at approximately 150 K. Unlike pyrolytic graphite, the x-y planar conductivity is consistent across each basal plane, thus the conductivity in the center planes is consistent with the outer planes. The in-plane covalently bonded carbon atoms in a hexagonal geometry account for APG’s high in-plane thermal conductivity and its high in-plane stiffness. Through its thickness, these hexagonal planes are weakly bonded (van der Waals bonds) resulting in a material with poor <b>through-thickness</b> thermal conductivity, stiffness, and strength.|$|E
50|$|Three-dimensional fiberglass-reinforced polymer {{composites}} are {{materials with}} three-dimensional fiber structures that incorporate fibers in the x-direction, y-direction and z-direction. The development of three-dimensional orientations arose from industry's {{need to reduce}} fabrication costs, to increase <b>through-thickness</b> mechanical properties, and to improve impact damage tolerance; all were problems associated with two-dimensional fibre-reinforced polymers.|$|E
50|$|The use of both shear and {{longitudinal}} pulses is advantageous {{for measuring}} elastic constants or sound velocities. Shear waves {{may also be}} generated {{by the use of}} elastically anisotropic solids cut at oblique angles to the crystal axes. This allows shear or quasi-shear waves to be generated with a large amplitude in the <b>through-thickness</b> direction.|$|E
50|$|Acoustic pulses are {{generated}} with a temporal duration approximately {{equal to the}} acoustic transit time across this initially heated depth, in general greater than the optical absorption depth. For example, the optical absorption depths in Al and GaAs are ~10 nm for blue light, but the electron diffusion depths are ~50 and 100 nm, respectively. The diffusion depth determines the spatial extent of the strain pulse in the <b>through-thickness</b> direction.|$|E
50|$|Two-dimensional fibreglass-reinforced polymer is {{characterized}} by a laminated structure in which the fibers are only aligned along the plane in x-direction, and y-direction of the material. This means that no fibers are aligned in the <b>through-thickness</b> or the z-direction, this lack of alignment in the through thickness can create a disadvantage in cost and processing. Costs and labor increase because conventional processing techniques used to fabricate composites, such as wet hand lay-up, autoclave and resin transfer molding, require a high amount of skilled labor to cut, stack and consolidate into a preformed component.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{techniques}} {{used to measure}} residual stresses, which are broadly categorised into destructive, semi-destructive and non-destructive techniques. The selection of the technique depends on the information required {{and the nature of}} the measurement specimen. Factors include the depth/penetration of the measurement (surface or <b>through-thickness),</b> the length scale to be measured over (macroscopic, mesoscopic or microscopic), the resolution of the information required, and also the composition geometry and location of the specimen. Additionally, some of the techniques need to be performed in specialised laboratory facilities, meaning that [...] "on-site" [...] measurements are not possible for all of the techniques.|$|E
5000|$|The {{microstructure}} of a 3D woven composite {{is mainly}} {{determined by the}} fiber architecture to the woven preform and weaving process, {{and to a lesser}} extent by the process of consolidation.Various types of defects are inadvertently created during the 3D weaving process that can possibly degrade the in-plane, <b>through-thickness,</b> and impact properties of the 3D composite. Research has found that testing various 3D composite materials that “ ...the strength is the same or slightly higher than an equivalent two-dimensional (2D) material.” When compared to a 2D composite, the impact resistance, compression after impact (CAI), and delamination control is significantly improved with a 3D composite without significantly reducing the mechanical properties along the plane.|$|E
5000|$|... 3D {{orthogonal}} {{woven fabrics}}, are 3D woven fabrics produced {{on a special}} 3D weaving loom. The process to form such fabric was patented by Mohamed and Zhang. The architecture of the 3D orthogonal woven fabric consists of three different sets of yarns; warp yarns (y-yarn), weft yarns (x-yarn), and (z-yarn). Z-yarn {{is placed in the}} <b>through-thickness</b> direction of the perform. In 3D orthogonal woven fabric there is no interlacing between warp and weft yarns and they are straight and perpendicular to each other. On the other hand, z-yarns combine the warp and the weft layers by interlacing (moving up and down) along the y-direction over the weft yarn. Interlacing occurs on the top and the bottom surface of the fabric.|$|E
50|$|The LPB process {{includes}} {{a unique and}} patented way of analyzing, designing, and testing metallic components {{in order to develop}} the unique metal treatment necessary to improve performance and reduce metal fatigue, SCC, and corrosion fatigue failures. Lambda designs a new tool for each component to provide the best results possible and to ensure that the apparatus reaches every inch on the component. With this practice of constantly redesigning, along with the closed-loop process control system, LPB has been shown to produce a maximum compression of 12mm, although the average is around 1-7+mm. LPB has even been shown {{to have the ability to}} produce <b>through-thickness</b> compression in blades and vanes, greatly increasing their damage tolerance over 10-fold, effectively mitigating most FOD and reducing inspection requirements. No material is removed during this process, even when correcting corrosion damage. LPB smooths surface asperities during machining, leaving an improved, almost mirror-like surface finish that is vastly better looking and better protected than even a newly manufactured component.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The dynamic {{process of}} crack {{initiation}} and propagation in a SiC/BN-Al 2 O 3 laminated composite {{was observed in}} situ by scanning electron microscopy. During a bending test with a single-edge notched-beam specimen, an interfacial crack first initiated in the interlayer near the notch tip, after which a <b>through-thickness</b> crack formed in the matrix layer at the notch tip. After the <b>through-thickness</b> crack had grown across the first matrix layer, it was deflected by the next interlayer and again became an interfacial crack. Interfacial cracks and <b>through-thickness</b> cracks were generated alternately until the composite failed. The load-displacement plot of the laminated composite exhibited several peaks, each caused by one propagation of a <b>through-thickness</b> crack. The toughening mechanisms of the laminated composite included crack deflection, interfacial cracking, and <b>through-thickness</b> branch cracking...|$|E

40|$|A <b>through-thickness</b> reinforcement, in {{the form}} of stitching, short fibrous or {{metallic}} rods (z-pins), or woven or braided tows, offers a cost-effective approach to control and even suppress delamination fracture in composite laminates subject to static loading [1 - 9]. Recent experimental tests have demonstrated the effectiveness of a <b>through-thickness</b> reinforcement in improving the performance of laminates and layered systems against dynamic loading, low-velocity impact, ballistic impact and blast loading [10 - 16]. This paper deals with a theoretical investigation of the response of <b>through-thickness</b> reinforced structures subject to dynamic loading. The preliminary results of two studies aimed at investigating the effectiveness of a <b>through-thickness</b> reinforcement in reducing the delamination-induced degradation of the dynamic properties of composite structures and in improving the response of delaminated beams against dynamic fracture will be presented [17, 18]. For the first problem, it will be shown that a <b>through-thickness</b> reinforcement can actually restore the dynamic properties, natural frequencies of vibration and modal shapes, of the intact beam. For the second problem it will be shown that for low to moderate crack velocities a <b>through-thickness</b> reinforcement can substantially improve the response of the structure against dynamic fracture...|$|E

The matrix material of choice was nylon 6. Samples were printed exploring a range of reinforcement volume content. In summary, this study presents {{an assessment of the}} applicability of <b>through-thickness</b> testing to AM CFRP specimens and provides a performance comparison between AM composite <b>through-thickness</b> properties and the properties of equivalent CM CFRP specimens...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{a description of}} the experimental procedure employed when using a pulsed-magneto-polariscope (PMP) and some initial full-field <b>through-thickness</b> measurements of the stress distribution present in samples containing 3 D stresses. The instrument uses the theory of magneto-photoelasticity (MPE), which is an experimental stress analysis technique that involves the application of a magnetic field to a birefringent model within a polariscope. MPE was developed for <b>through-thickness</b> stress measurement where the integrated <b>through-thickness</b> birefringent measurement disguises the actual stress distribution. MPE is mainly used in toughened glass where the <b>through-thickness</b> distribution can reduce its overall strength and so its determination is important. To date MPE has been a single-point 2 D <b>through-thickness</b> measurement and the analysis time is prohibitive for the investigation of an area which may contain high localised stresses. The pulsed-magneto-polariscope (PMP) has been designed to enable the application of full-field 3 D MPE []. Using a proof-of concept PMP several experimental measurements were made, these were promising and demonstrate the potential of the new instrument. Further development of this technique presents several exciting possibilities including a tool for the measurement of the distribution of principal stress difference seen in a general 3 D model. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates for {{the first}} time the usage of <b>through-thickness</b> {{reinforcement}} for delamination detection in self-sensing composite laminates. Electrically conductive T 300 /BMI Z-pins are considered in this study. The <b>through-thickness</b> electrical resistance is measured as the delamination self-sensing variable, both for conductive and non-conductive laminates. The Z-pin ends are connected to a resistance measurement circuit via electrodes arranged on the surface of the laminate. The delamination self-sensing function enabled by conductive Z-pins is characterised for Mode I/II delamination bridging, using single Z-pin coupons. Experiment results show that, if the <b>through-thickness</b> reinforced laminate is electrically conductive, the whole Z-pin pull-out process associated with delamination bridging can be monitored. However, for a non-conductive laminate, delamination bridging may not be sensed after the Z-pin is pulled out from one of the surface electrodes. Regardless of the electrical properties of the reinforced laminate, the <b>through-thickness</b> electrical resistance is capable of detecting Mode II bridging, albeit there exists an initial “blind spot” at relatively small lateral deformation. However, the Z-pin rupture can be clearly detected as an abrupt resistance increase. This study paves the way for exploring multi-functional applications of <b>through-thickness</b> reinforcement...|$|E

40|$|Improving {{manufacturing}} technology {{is one of}} the greatest challenges for the resin transfer molding (RTM) process. Permeability parameters that include in-plane and transverse permeability are important in simulation codes. Especially, <b>through-thickness</b> permeability is a critical parameter in the optimization of complex shaped and thick-sectioned composites. This research work presents a new method based on radial technology to determine transverse permeability. A key difference when compared to other methods is the layout of reinforcement placement. The fabric is wound and placed on the mold. The fluid flows radially into the reinforcement along the <b>through-thickness</b> direction. The new method avoids racetracking, and it is easy to view the flow front. The measurement of <b>through-thickness</b> permeability is translated into an in-plane measurement of radial technique. The <b>through-thickness</b> permeability for woven fabric tape and fiberglass roving is measured. The experiment shows that the width of the sample has no significant influence on transverse permeability...|$|E

40|$|Bridged crack models using {{beam theory}} {{formulations}} {{have proved to}} be effective in modeling quasistatic delamination crack growth under large scale bridging conditions in <b>through-thickness</b> reinforced structures. In this paper, beam theory is used to study dynamic mode I crack propagation in <b>through-thickness</b> reinforced laminar structures. In particular, steady state dynamic crack growth for a Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) loaded with a flying wedge is examined. The steady state crack propagation characteristics are mapped out in terms of controllable loading and material parameters including the crack velocity and the properties of the throughthickness reinforcement. For small crack velocities, the <b>through-thickness</b> reinforcement considerably enhances the delamination resistance of the structure. At higher velocities, the kinetic energy term dominates the overall energetics and the relative effect of the reinforcement on the delamination resistance is insignificant.

40|$|Reliable {{numerical}} {{prediction of}} springback in {{sheet metal forming}} {{is essential for the}} automotive industry. There are numerous factors that influence the accuracy of springback prediction by using the finite element method. One of the reasons is the <b>through-thickness</b> numerical integration of shell elements. It is known that even for simple problems the traditional integration schemes may require up to 50 integration points to achieve a high accuracy of springback analysis. An adaptive <b>through-thickness</b> integration strategy can be a good alternative. The strategy defines abscissas and weights depending on the integrand's properties and, thus, can adapt itself to improve the accuracy of integration. A concept of the adaptive <b>through-thickness</b> integration strategy for shell elements is presented. It is tested using a simple problem of bending of a beam under tension. Results show that for a similar set of material and process parameters the adaptive Simpson's rule with 7 integration points performs better than the traditional trapezoidal rule with 50 points. The adaptive <b>through-thickness</b> integration strategy for shell elements can improve the accuracy of springback prediction at minimal cost...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Self-sensing {{refers to}} the {{structural}} material sensing itself. Real-time self-sensing of damage in carbon fibre polymer–matrix composites by electrical resistance measurement is reviewed. The resistance changes irreversibly upon damage, as shown for damage inflicted by flexure, tension, fatigue, and impact. Delamination increases the <b>through-thickness</b> resistance. Fibre breakage increases the longitudinal resistance. The oblique resistance, as measured at an angle between the longitudinal and <b>through-thickness</b> directions, is particularly sensitive. Minor flexural damage causes the oblique resistance in the unloaded state to decrease. Current spread-ing enables the sensing of localized damage by measurement away from the damage, though it reduces the spatial resolution of the sensing. The resistance method is more sensitive than the potential method. Two-dimensional sensing {{is complicated by the}} anisotropic spreading of the current. Thermal damage and <b>through-thickness</b> (fastening) compression effect are indi-cated by the contact resistivity of the interlaminar interface. The <b>through-thickness</b> compression effect is alternately indicated by the longitudinal volume resistivity.
