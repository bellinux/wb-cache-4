5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} {{has also}} been rated as least-concern. The population trend is stable, and <b>their</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> estimated to be around 1,500,000 – mainly due to the increase of the populations in Serengeti National Park (Tanzania) to 1,300,000. However, the numbers {{of one of the}} subspecies, the Eastern white-bearded wildebeest (C. t. albojubatus) have seen a steep decline. Population density ranges from 0.15/km2. in Hwange and Etosha National Parks to 35/km2 in Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Serengeti National Park.|$|E
5|$|Among the Ainu, the otter {{is portrayed}} as an {{occasional}} messenger between humans and the creator. The sea otter is a recurring figure in Ainu folklore. A major Ainu epic, the Kutune Shirka, tells the tale of wars and struggles over a golden sea otter. Versions of a widespread Aleut legend tell of lovers or despairing women who plunge into the sea and become otters. These links {{have been associated with}} the many human-like behavioral features of the sea otter, including apparent playfulness, strong mother-pup bonds and tool use, yielding to ready anthropomorphism. The beginning of commercial exploitation had a great impact on the human, as well as animal, populations the Ainu and Aleuts have been displaced or <b>their</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> dwindling, while the coastal tribes of North America, where the otter is in any case greatly depleted, no longer rely as intimately on sea mammals for survival.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} of condors grew, {{attention}} {{began to focus on}} releasing some back into the wild. In 1988, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive Andean condors into the wild in California. Only females were released, to eliminate the possibility of accidentally introducing a South American species into the United States. The experiment was a success, and all the Andean condors were recaptured and re-released in South America. California condors were released in 1991 and 1992 in California, and again in 1996 in Arizona near the Grand Canyon. Though the birth rate remains low in the wild, <b>their</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> increasing steadily through regular releases of captive-reared adolescents.|$|E

5|$|In {{the solitary}} phase, these {{grasshoppers}} are innocuous, <b>their</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> low, {{and they do}} not pose a major economic threat to agriculture. However, under suitable conditions of drought followed by rapid vegetation growth, serotonin in their brains triggers a dramatic set of changes: they start to breed abundantly, becoming gregarious and nomadic (loosely described as migratory) when their populations become dense enough. They form bands of wingless nymphs which later become swarms of winged adults. Both the bands and the swarms move around and rapidly strip fields and cause damage to crops. The adults are powerful fliers; they can travel great distances, consuming most of the green vegetation wherever the swarm settles.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the species}} once {{inhabited}} rainforests, swamps, and cloud forests in India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and China. In historical times, they lived in southwest China, particularly in Sichuan. They are now critically endangered, with only five substantial populations in the wild: four on Sumatra and one on Borneo. <b>Their</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> difficult to determine because they are solitary animals that are widely scattered across their range, but they are estimated to number fewer than 100. Survival of the Peninsular Malaysia population is in doubt, {{and one of the}} Sumatran populations may already be extinct. In 2015, researchers announced that the Bornean rhinoceros had become extinct from the northern part of Borneo (Sabah, Malaysia); however, a tiny population was discovered in East Kalimantan in early 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} {{began on}} 22 September 1283. Prince Sangqudar was the commander-in-chief {{of the invasion}} force; his deputies were Vice Governor Taipn, and commander Yagan Tegin. The Mongol armies marched to the border in two columns. One column advanced along the Taping River using over 200 boats; the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at the Burmese fort at Ngasaunggyan. The Burmese chronicles report an overwhelming number of Mongol forces laying siege to the fort although <b>their</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> greatly exaggerated. (The chronicles say that the Burmese army numbered 400,000 men while the Mongol army numbered 20 million men and 6 million horses.) The Burmese withstood the siege for over two months but the fort fell on 3 December 1283.|$|E

5|$|The {{island has}} been {{occupied}} since the Mesolithic period, {{and its history}} includes a time of Norse rule and {{a long period of}} domination by Clan MacLeod and Clan Donald. The 18th century Jacobite risings led to the breaking up of the clan system and subsequent Clearances that replaced entire communities with sheep farms, some of which also involved forced emigrations to distant lands. Resident numbers declined from over 20,000 in the early 19th century to just under 9,000 by the closing decade of the 20th century. Skye's population increased by 4 per cent between 1991 and 2001. About a third of the residents were Gaelic speakers in 2001, and although <b>their</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> in decline, this aspect of island culture remains important.|$|E
5|$|Individual mysids {{are either}} male or female, and {{fertilisation}} is external. The gonads {{are in the}} thorax and are tubular in shape. Males have two gonopores in the eighth thoracic segment {{and a pair of}} long penises. The female gonopores are in the sixth thoracic segment and the oostegites are attached to the first to seventh pereopods to form a brood pouch. Mating usually takes place at night and lasts only a few minutes. During the process, the male inserts his penises into the marsupium and releases sperm. This stimulates the female and the eggs are usually released into the marsupium within an hour. Here they are fertilised and retained, development of the embryos in the brood pouch being direct with the young hatching from the eggs as miniature adults. The size of a mysid brood generally correlates with body length and environmental factors such as density and food availability. The age at which mysids reach sexual maturity depends on water temperature and food availability. For the species Mysidopsis bahia, this is normally at 12 to 20 days. The young are released soon afterwards, and although <b>their</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> usually low, the short reproductive cycle of mysid adults means a new brood can be produced every four to seven days.|$|E
5|$|The {{majuscule}} letters have elegant shape, but {{a little}} less simple {{than those in the}} Sinaiticus and Vaticanus codices. These letters, {{at the end of a}} line, are often very small, and much of the writing is very pale and faint. Punctuation is more frequent, usually on a level with the top of the preceding letter, while a vacant space, proportionate to the break in the sense, follows the end of a paragraph. At the end of each book the colophon is ornamented by pretty volutes from prima manu. There are found the Ammonian Sections with references to the Eusebian Canons stand in the margin of the text of the Gospels. It contains divisions into larger sections – κεφάλαια, the headings of these sections (τίτλοι) stand at the top of the pages. The places at which those sections commence are indicated throughout the Gospels, and in Luke and John <b>their</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> placed in the margin of each column. To all the Gospels (except Matthew, because of lacunae) is prefixed by a table of κεφάλαια (table of contents).|$|E

From 1971 to 1991, the percentage of Croats fell due to emigration into Croatia and Western Europe. Nevertheless, the fall in population percentage is only absent in western Herzegovina municipalities where Croats account for more than 98% of the population.
