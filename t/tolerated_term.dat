Fear of infection (on account of which are also made many of the so-called “rejection response”), led surgeons to refrain from the use of bio-materials for the cure of groin hernia, long time. Currently there is a tendency to overuse the mesh in the surgical treatment of various defects parietal, contrary to initial reluctance, which is based on understanding the biomechanical role of the prosthesis and its interaction with tissues. But accidental infections with commensally germs have not dropped, despite obvious progress on asepsia and antisepsia, namely ease of obtaining with modern substances and technology.

40|$|Gene {{expression}} during {{muscle cell}} differentiation is tightly regulated at multiple levels, including translation initiation. The PI 3 K/mTOR signalling pathway exerts control over protein synthesis by regulating assembly of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4 F, a heterotrimeric complex that stimulates recruitment of ribosomes to mRNA templates. One of the subunits of eIF 4 F, eIF 4 A, supplies essential helicase function {{during this phase}} of translation. The presence of two cellular eIF 4 A isoforms, eIF 4 AI and eIF 4 AII, has long thought to impart equivalent functions to eIF 4 F. However, recent experiments have alluded to distinct activities between them. Herein, we characterize distinct regulatory mechanisms between the eIF 4 A isoforms during muscle cell differentiation. We find that eIF 4 AI levels decrease during differentiation whereas eIF 4 AII levels increase during myofiber formation in a MyoD-dependent manner. This study characterizes a previously undefined mechanism for eIF 4 AII regulation in differentiation and highlights functional differences between eIF 4 AI and eIF 4 AII.

Treatment with ganciclovir was begun on a protocol which provided two weeks of inpatient therapy at daily doses of 2. 5 to 10 mg/kg followed by outpatient therapy at a reduced dosage three to six days per week. Outpatient maintenance dosage ranged from 15 mg/kg per week to 30 mg/kg per week. In seven eyes of six patients the treatment decreased retinal inflammation and stabilised the margins of the lesions. Six patients have <b>tolerated</b> long <b>term</b> maintenance therapy for 10 - 30 weeks. Six of seven patients (85 %) in this study developed side effects from ganciclovir which required periods of a reduction in dosage or interruption of therapy. The side effects from ganciclovir included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, drug fever, and neuropathy. Physicians using ganciclovir in AIDS patients must watch for the signs of drug toxicity and adjust treatment accordingly.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundIn {{spite of}} the {{numerous}} publications of dosimetric comparison of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) versus conventional radiotherapy in pediatrics, few data exist regarding the clinical use of IMRT and its potential late effects. ProcedurePediatric neuroblastoma patients treated between November 2008 and October 2010 with IMRT were reviewed. Treatment plans, clinical, laboratory and radiological data at the last follow up date were evaluated. ResultsThirteen patients received IMRT. The mean age was 4. 9 ± 2 years. The radiation dose ranged from 21 to 25. 5 Gy with a mean dose of 24. 06 Gy. The mean liver dose was 9. 81 Gy. The V 8 of the liver was 51 ± 20 %, and the V 15 of the liver was 21 ± 12 %. V 18 of {{the right and left}} kidneys were 32 ± 27 % and 23 ± 18 % respectively. The minimum and maximum vertebral point doses were 12. 82 and 24. 87 Gy respectively. The IMRT treatment was well <b>tolerated</b> in <b>terms</b> of acute toxicity. At 26 month follow up, second malignancy and skeletal asymmetry were not noted, and the liver and the kidney functions showed no significant abnormalities. ConclusionsThe use of IMRT in pediatric neuroblastoma confers higher target conformality with better sparing of the kidneys and it did not show any considerable short term side effects...|$|R

40|$|Background: Firm {{recommendations}} {{about the}} way thiopurine drugs are introduced {{and the use of}} thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and metabolite measurements during treatment in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are lacking. Aim: To evaluate pharmacokinetics and tolerance after initiation of thiopurine treatment with a fixed dosing schedule in patients with IBD. Patients: 60 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease (n = 33) or ulcerative colitis (n = 27) were included in a 20 week open, prospective study. Methods: Thiopurine treatment was introduced using a predefined dose escalation schedule, reaching a daily target dose at week 3 of 2. 5 mg azathioprine or 1. 25 mg 6 -mercaptopurine per kg body weight. TPMT and ITPA genotypes, TPMT activity, TPMT gene expression, and thiopurine metabolites were determined. Clinical outcome and occurrence of adverse events were monitored. Results: 27 patients completed the study per protocol, while 33 were withdrawn (early protocol violation (n = 5), TPMT deficiency (n = 1), thiopurine related adverse events (n = 27)); 67 % of patients with adverse events <b>tolerated</b> long <b>term</b> treatment on a lower dose (median 1. 32 mg azathioprine/kg body weight). TPMT activity did not change during the 20 week course of the study but a significant decrease in TPMT gene expression was found (TPMT/huCYC ratio; p = 0. 02).

Comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) should include strength training, {{in particular to}} lower limbs. Furthermore, simple tools {{for the assessment of}} peripheral muscle performance are required. Objectives: To assess the peripheral muscle performance of COPD patients by the sit-to-stand test (STST), as compared to the one-repetition maximum (1 -RM), considered as the gold standard for assessing muscle strength in non-laboratory situations, and to evaluate the responsiveness of STST to a PR program. Methods: Sixty moderate-to-severe COPD inpatients were randomly included into either the specific strength training group or into the usual PR program group. Patients were assessed on a 30 -second STST and 1 -minute STST, 1 -RM, and 6 -minute walking test (6 MWT), before and after PR. Bland–Altman plots were used to evaluate the agreement between 1 -RM and STST. Results: The two groups were not different at baseline. In all patients, 1 -RM was significantly related to the 30 -second STST (r= 0. 48, P< 0. 001) and to 1 -minute STST (r= 0. 36, P= 0. 005). The 30 -second STST was better <b>tolerated</b> in <b>terms</b> of the perceived fatigue (P= 0. 002) and less time consuming (P< 0. 001) test. In the specific strength training group significant improvements were observed in the 30 -second STST (P< 0. 001), 1 -minute STST (P= 0. 005), 1 -RM (P< 0. 001), and in the 6 MWT (P= 0. 001). In the usual PR program group, significant improvement was observed in the 30 -second STST (P= 0. 042) and in the 6 MWT (P= 0. 001).

40|$|The {{interaction}} between cells and biopolymers is the evaluation {{indicator of the}} biocompatibility of materials. The purpose of this work {{was to examine the}} responses of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells to genipin (GP) or glutaraldehyde (GTA) cross-linked chitosan by means of cell viability assays, cytokine expression analyses, and apoptosis assays. Evaluations of non-cross-linked chitosan were conducted simultaneously for comparison. Both GP and GTA treated samples with the same extent of cross-linking (around 80 %) were prepared by varying cross-linking time. Our results showed that GP cross-linking was carried out by either radical polymerization of the monomers or SN 2 nucleophilic substitution reaction involving the replacement of the ester group on the monomer with a secondary amide linkage. On the other hand, GTA could react with free amino groups of chitosan, leading to the formation of either the Schiff bases or the Michael-type adducts with terminal aldehydes. The biocompatibility of non-cross-linked chitosan membranes was demonstrated by the absence of any signs of toxicity or inflammation reaction. The present study showed that the ARPE- 19 cells exposed to GTA cross-linked chitosan membranes had significantly higher cytotoxicity, interleukin- 6 levels, and number of TUNEL-positive nuclei than did those exposed to GP treated samples. In addition, the materials modified with GTA trigger apoptosis at an early stage and may induce toxicity in the RPE cells later. The findings suggest that while the chitosan molecules bridged by GP are satisfactorily cytocompatible, the counterparts treated by GTA {{do not seem to be}} <b>tolerated.</b> In <b>terms</b> of material safety, the GP cross-linked chitosan may be compatible with human RPE cells and may have a potential application as delivery carriers in the treatment of posterior segment diseases...|$|R
50|$|During {{the first}} weeks of life, all infants {{experience}} a decline in circulating red blood cell (RBC) volume generally expressed as blood hemoglobin concentration (Hb). As anemia develops, there is {{even more of a}} significant reduction in the concentration of hemoglobin. Normally this stimulates a significant increased production of erythropoietin (EPO), but this response is diminished in premature infants. Dear, Gill, Newell, Richards and Schwarz (2005) conducted a study to show that there is a weak negative correlation between EPO and Hb. The researchers recruited 39 preterm infants from 10 days of age or as soon as they could manage without respiratory support. They estimated total EPO and Hb weekly and 2 days after a blood transfusion. The study found that when Hb>10, EPO mean was 20.6 and when Hb≤10, EPO mean was 26.8. As Hb goes down, EPO goes up. While the reason for this decreased response is not fully understood, Strauss (n.d.) states that it results from both physiological factors (e.g., the rapid rate of growth and need for a commensurate increase in RBC mass to accompany the increase in blood volume) and, in sick premature infants, from phlebotomy blood losses. In premature infants this decline occurs earlier and more pronounced that it does in healthy term infants. Healthy term infants Hb rarely falls below 9 g/dL at an age of approximately 10-12 weeks, while in premature infants, even in those without complicating illnesses, the mean Hb falls to approximately 8g/dL in infants of 1.0-1.5 kg birth weight and to 7g/dL in infants <1.0 kg. Because this postnatal drop in hemoglobin level is universal and is well <b>tolerated</b> in <b>term</b> infants, it is commonly referred to as the “physiologic” anemia of infancy. However, in premature infants the decline in Hb may be associated with abnormal clinical signs severe enough to prompt transfusions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Febuxostat is a novel, potent, non-purine {{selective}} {{xanthine oxidase}} inhibitor, which {{in clinical trials}} demonstrated superior ability to lower and maintain serum urate levels below 6 mg/dL compared with conventionally used doses of allopurinol. Febuxostat was well <b>tolerated</b> in long <b>term</b> treatment in patients with hyperuricemia including those experiencing hypersensitity/intolerance to allopurinol. Dose adjustment appears unnecessary in patients with mild to moderate renal or liver insuffi ciency or advanced age. The most common adverse reactions reported were abnormal liver function tests, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms, which were usually mild and transient. However, whether hepatotoxicity becomes a limitation {{in the use of}} febuxostat needs to be determined in further studies. An increased frequency of gout fl ares occurs for a prolonged period after treatment initiation, as with any aggressive lowering of serum urate, and prolonged prophylaxis with colchicine or NSAIDs is usually required. Febuxostat has been granted marketing authorization by the European Commission in early 2008 for the treatment of chronic hyperuricemia and gout. Febuxostat is the fi rst major treat-ment alternative for gout in more than 40 years and is a promising alternative to allopurinol, although continued long-term surveillance on safety and effi cacy is required...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Perfect {{difference}} networks (PDNs) {{that are}} based on the mathematical notion of perfect difference sets have been shown to comprise an asymptotically optimal method for connecting a number of nodes into a network with diameter 2. Justifications for, and mathematical underpinning of, PDNs appear in a companion paper. In this paper, we compare PDNs and some of their derivatives to interconnection networks with similar cost/performance, including certain generalized hypercubes and their hierarchical variants. Additionally, we discuss point-to-point and collective communication algorithms and derive a general emulation result that relates the performance of PDNs to that of complete networks as ideal benchmarks. We show that PDNs are quite robust, both with regard to node and link failures that can be <b>tolerated</b> and in <b>terms</b> of blandness (not having weak spots). In particular, we prove that the fault diameter of PDNs is no greater than 4. Finally, we study the complexity and scalability aspects of these networks, concluding that PDNs and their derivatives allow the construction of very low diameter networks close to any arbitrary desired size and that, in many respects, PDNs offer optimal performance and fault tolerance relative to their complexity or implementation cost...|$|R
40|$|Although {{herbivory}} {{may result}} in plant death, the mode and timing of damage may produce variable wounding responses in the attacked plant. In this study, effects {{of different types of}} apical meristem damage on growth and performance of sea oxeye daisy Borrichia frutescens (L.) DC were compared. Damage involved either clipping or galling of the apical meristem by the gall midge Asphondylia borrichiae Rossi and Strong. Apical dominance was relatively weak before flowering and stronger in short ramets that were shaded by taller neighbors later in the season. Clipped ramets delayed sprouting new stems, and galled ramets sprouted new stems quickly compared to intact ramets, but final stem counts were similar across treatments. Clipping significantly delayed flowering, reduced seed head ripening time, and resulted in fewer seed heads and seeds. Galling did not significantly impact reproduction compared to intact ramets. Nitrogen supplementation significantly increased stem count and seed count and lengthened seed ripening time. Borrichia frutescens responds differently to clipping versus galling by A. borrichiae and better <b>tolerates</b> galling in <b>terms</b> of nonreproductive performance and survival. Galling from A. borrichiae likely prevents Borrichia frutescens from flowering, which suggests resource regulation of meristems by the midge...|$|R
40|$|Compensatory growth {{response}} and body composition of male sailfin molly, Poecilia latipinna subjected to short-term starvation and subsequent feeding were studied for 54 days. Four feeding schedules {{were used in}} this study: C, Control (were fed to apparent satiation throughout the experiment); T 1, Treatment 1 (3 days Starvation and 6 days refeeding); T 2, Treatment 2 (6 days Starvation and 12 days refeeding); T 3, Treatment 3 (9 days Starvation and 18 days refeeding). At {{the end of the}} experiment, the starved fish gained a body weight comparable to that of the control fish. There were no differences in condition factor, specific growth rate and weight gain between the starved and control fish {{at the end of the}} experiment. Daily feed intake was significantly higher in T 3 than that in the control. Short-term starvation did not influence protein, lipid and ash contents. Moisture content of T 2 and T 3 fish were significantly higher than those of T 1 and control fish. The results indicated that complete compensation occurred in the starved fish and that this species can <b>tolerate</b> to short <b>term</b> starvation without any significant effects on growth and feeding performance...|$|R

40|$|Background: There {{are already}} many {{effective}} topical therapies {{available for use}} in the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. Unfortunately, these treatments are often associated with a not insignificant risk of undesirable effects. Objective and methods: In the randomized, prospective clinical trial discussed in the following, the therapeutic effects of the standard vitamin D 3 analog calcipotriol were evaluated against those of a recently developed vitamin B 12 ointment containing avocado oil preparation in an intraindividual right/left-side comparison. The efficacy of vitamin B 12 in the treatment of psoriasis has already been demonstrated. The trial collective consisted of 13 patients, ten men and three women, with chronic plaque psoriasis. The observation period was 12 weeks; the effects of therapy were assessed {{on the basis of a}} PASI score adapted to the right/left-side comparison technique, the subjective evaluations of the investigator and patients and the results of 20 MHz sonography. Results: There was more rapid development of beneficial effects with use of calcipotriol in the initial 8 weeks, although differences in effects were significant only at the time point therapy week 8 (p< 0. 05). After 12 weeks, neither the PASI score nor 20 MHz sonography showed significant differences between the two treatments. While the efficacy of the calcipotriol preparation reached a maximum in the first 4 weeks and then began subsequently to subside, the effects of the vitamin B 12 ointment containing avocado oil remained at a constant level over the whole observation period. This would indicate that the vitamin B 12 preparation containing avocado oil may be suitable for use in long term therapy, a hypothesis further supported by the fact that the investigator and patients assessed the tolerability of the vitamin B 12 ointment containing avocado oil as significantly better in comparison with that of calcipotriol. Conclusion: The results of this clinical trial provide evidence that the recently developed vitamin B 12 ointment containing avocado oil has considerable potential as a well <b>tolerated,</b> long <b>term</b> topical therapy of psoriasis...|$|R
