5|$|Although the {{problems}} of listing maximal cliques or finding maximum cliques {{are unlikely to be}} fixed-parameter <b>tractable</b> with the parameter , they may be fixed-parameter <b>tractable</b> for other parameters of instance complexity. For instance, both problems are known to be fixed-parameter <b>tractable</b> when parametrized by the degeneracy of the input graph.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{successive}} offensives of early August, exact Canadian casualties for Operation <b>Tractable</b> {{are not known}} but losses during Totalize and <b>Tractable</b> are put at 5,500 men. German casualties during Operation <b>Tractable</b> are also uncertain; approximate figures can be found for casualties within the Falaise Pocket {{but not for the}} Canadian operations during <b>Tractable.</b> After the Falaise Pocket, the German 7th Army was severely depleted, having lost from 50,000–200,000 men, over 200 tanks, 1,000 guns and 5,000 other vehicles. In the fighting around Hill262, the Germans lost 2,000 men killed, 5,000 taken prisoner, 55 tanks, 44 guns and 152 armoured vehicles. Polish casualties for Operation <b>Tractable</b> (until 22 August) are 1,441 men, of whom 325 were killed (including 21 officers), 1,002 were wounded (35 officers) and 114 missing, which includes 263 men lost before the Chambois and Ormel actions from 14–18 August.|$|E
5|$|It also {{provides}} a powerful toolkit for studying strongly coupled quantum field theories. Much of {{the usefulness of the}} duality results {{from the fact that it}} is a strong-weak duality: when the fields of the quantum field theory are strongly interacting, the ones in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting and thus more mathematically <b>tractable.</b> This fact has been used to study many aspects of nuclear and condensed matter physics by translating problems in those subjects into more mathematically <b>tractable</b> problems in string theory.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the first}} day's {{progress}} was slower than expected, Operation <b>Tractable</b> resumed on 15 August; both armoured divisions pushed southeast toward Falaise. The Canadian 2nd and 3rd Infantry Divisions—with {{the support of}} the Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade—continued their drive south towards the town. After harsh fighting, the 4th Armoured Division captured Soulangy but the gains made were minimal as strong German resistance prevented a breakthrough to Trun. On 16 August, the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division broke into Falaise, encountering minor opposition from Waffen-SS units and scattered pockets of German infantry. Although it would take two more days to clear all resistance in the town, the first major objective of Operation <b>Tractable</b> had been achieved. Simonds began to reorganize the bulk of his armoured forces for a renewed push towards Trun to close the Falaise Pocket.|$|E
5|$|The {{computational}} {{complexity of}} finding a homomorphism between given graphs is prohibitive in general, but a lot is known about special cases that are solvable in polynomial time. Boundaries between <b>tractable</b> and intractable cases have been an active area of research.|$|E
5|$|Using human {{manufacturing}} processes, wheeled {{systems of}} varying complexity have proven fairly simple to construct, {{and issues of}} power transmission and friction have proven <b>tractable.</b> It is not clear, however, that the vastly different processes of embryonic development are suited to—or even capable of—producing a functioning wheel, for reasons described below.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of bounded expansion, the subgraph isomorphism problem, of finding whether a pattern graph of bounded size exists as a subgraph of a larger graph, can be solved in linear time when the larger graph has bounded book thickness. The {{same is true for}} detecting whether the pattern graph is an induced subgraph of the larger graph, or whether it has a graph homomorphism to the larger graph. For the same reason, the problem of testing whether a graph of bounded book thickness obeys a given formula of first order logic is fixed-parameter <b>tractable.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that the {{universe}} is well described by four-dimensional spacetime, there are several reasons why physicists consider theories in other dimensions. In some cases, by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions, a theory becomes more mathematically <b>tractable,</b> and one can perform calculations and gain general insights more easily. There are also situations where theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are useful for describing phenomena in condensed matter physics. Finally, there exist scenarios in which there could actually be more than four dimensions of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection.|$|E
5|$|On 14 August, Canadian forces {{launched}} Operation <b>Tractable,</b> {{in conjunction}} with American movements northwards to Chambois. On 19 August, a brigade of the Polish 1st Armoured Division linked up with forces of the 90th U.S. Infantry Division, sealing off some 50,000 German troops in the pocket. By 21 August, German attempts to reopen the gap had been thwarted, and all German troops trapped in the pocket surrendered to Allied forces, effectively {{putting an end to}} the German 7th Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gases}} are nearly ideal gases under {{standard}} conditions, but their {{deviations from the}} ideal gas law provided important clues {{for the study of}} intermolecular interactions. The Lennard-Jones potential, often used to model intermolecular interactions, was deduced in 1924 by John Lennard-Jones from experimental data on argon before the development of quantum mechanics provided the tools for understanding intermolecular forces from first principles. The theoretical analysis of these interactions became <b>tractable</b> because the noble gases are monatomic and the atoms spherical, which means that the interaction between the atoms is independent of direction, or isotropic.|$|E
5|$|Operation <b>Tractable</b> was {{the final}} {{offensive}} conducted by Canadian and Polish troops, supported by one brigade of British tanks, {{as part of the}} Battle of Normandy during World War II. The goal of this operation was to capture the strategically important French town of Falaise and then the smaller towns of Trun and Chambois. This operation was undertaken by the First Canadian Army, the 1st Polish Armoured Division and a British armoured brigade against Army Group B of the Wehrmacht as part of the largest encirclement on the Western Front during the Second World War. Despite a slow start and limited gains north of Falaise, novel tactics by the 1st Polish Armoured Division—under the command of Generał brygady Stanisław Maczek during the drive for Chambois—enabled the Falaise Gap to be partially closed by 19 August 1944, trapping about 150,000 German soldiers in the Falaise Pocket.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} ergodic theory {{is the study}} of the {{long-term}} behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. The protypical case of a field that ergodic theory applies to is thermodynamics, in which—though the microscopic state of a system is extremely complicated (it is impossible to understand the ensemble of individual collisions between particles of matter)—the average behavior over sufficiently long time intervals is <b>tractable.</b> The laws of thermodynamics are assertions about such average behavior. In particular, one formulation of the zeroth law of thermodynamics asserts that over sufficiently long timescales, the only functionally independent measurement that one can make of a thermodynamic system in equilibrium is its total energy, in the form of temperature.|$|E
5|$|The intelligence, domesticability and {{versatility}} of {{the elephant}} gave it considerable advantages over other wild {{animals such as}} lions and bears used as executioners by the Romans. Elephants are more <b>tractable</b> than horses: while a horse can be trained to charge into battle, it will not willingly trample an enemy soldier, and will instead step over him. Elephants will trample their enemies, hence the popularity of war elephants with generals such as Hannibal. Elephants can be trained to execute prisoners {{in a variety of}} ways, and can be taught to prolong the agony of the victim by inflicting a slow death by torture or to kill the condemned quickly by stepping on the head.|$|E

25|$|In 1990 {{while working}} at Stanford University on large bioinformatic applications, Greg Cooper proved that exact {{inference}} in Bayesian networks is NP-hard. This result prompted a surge in research on approximation algorithms {{with the aim of}} developing a <b>tractable</b> approximation to probabilistic inference. In 1993, Paul Dagum and Michael Luby proved two surprising results on the complexity of approximation of probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks. First, they proved that there is no <b>tractable</b> deterministic algorithm that can approximate probabilistic inference to within an absolute error ɛ< 1/2. Second, they proved that there is no <b>tractable</b> randomized algorithm that can approximate probabilistic inference to within an absolute error ɛ < 1/2 with confidence probability greater than 1/2.|$|E

25|$|Predicting protein {{tertiary}} structure from only its {{amino acid sequence}} is a very challenging problem (see protein structure prediction), but using the simpler secondary structure definitions is more <b>tractable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Once II Corps was activated, Simonds would direct {{four major}} attacks during the Battle of Normandy in five weeks: Operations Atlantic (the Canadian part of Operation Goodwood), Spring, Totalize and <b>Tractable.</b>|$|E
25|$|The hitting set {{problem is}} fixed-{{parameter}} <b>tractable</b> for the parameter OPT+d, where d {{is the size}} of the largest edge of the hypergraph. More specifically, there is an algorithm for hitting set that runs in time dOPTn'O(1).|$|E
25|$|Steady flows {{are often}} more <b>tractable</b> than {{otherwise}} similar unsteady flows. The governing equations of a steady problem have one dimension fewer (time) than the governing equations of the same problem without {{taking advantage of the}} steadiness of the flow field.|$|E
25|$|Léon Walras first formalized {{the idea}} of a one-period {{economic}} equilibrium of the general economic system, but it was French economist Antoine Augustin Cournot and English political economist Alfred Marshall who developed <b>tractable</b> models to analyze an economic system.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} a {{boundary}} layer is important in many problems in aerodynamics. The viscosity and fluid friction in the air is approximated as being significant only in this thin layer. This assumption makes the description of such aerodynamics much more <b>tractable</b> mathematically.|$|E
25|$|Adding scalar quarks (squarks) and fermionic gluons (gluinos) to {{the theory}} makes it more <b>tractable,</b> but the {{thermodynamics}} of quark matter depends crucially {{on the fact that}} only fermions can carry quark number, and on the number of degrees of freedom in general.|$|E
25|$|Before computers, statisticians used {{methods that}} were {{computationally}} <b>tractable,</b> {{at the cost}} of known limitations. Since the 1980s these approximate statistical methods have been discarded: Modern twin methods based on structural equation modeling are not subject to the limitations and heritability estimates such as those noted above are mathematically impossible.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tractable</b> {{problems}} are frequently identified with {{problems that have}} polynomial-time solutions (P, PTIME); {{this is known as}} the Cobham–Edmonds thesis. Problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are EXPTIME-hard. If NP {{is not the same as}} P, then NP-hard {{problems are}} also intractable in this sense.|$|E
25|$|A few {{reports have}} {{identified}} papillomaviruses in smaller rodents, such as Syrian hamsters, the African multimammate rat and the Eurasian harvest mouse. However, {{there are no}} papillomaviruses known {{to be capable of}} infecting laboratory mice. The lack of a <b>tractable</b> mouse model for papillomavirus infection has been a major limitation for laboratory investigation of papillomaviruses.|$|E
25|$|Such a bill, if {{passed into}} law would have struck at very root of evil. No more Coromantins {{would have been}} brought to infest this country, but instead of their savage race, the island would have been {{supplied}} with Blacks of a more docile <b>tractable</b> disposition and better inclined to peace and agriculture.|$|E
25|$|With {{the civil}} {{wars of the}} early modern period, the king {{increasing}} turned to more <b>tractable</b> and subservient emissaries, {{and this was the}} reason for the growth of the provincial intendants under Louis XIII and Louis XIV. Indendants were chosen from among the maître des requêtes. Intendants attached to a province had jurisdiction over finances, justice and policing.|$|E
25|$|The {{size of the}} {{automaton}} {{constructed in}} this way is not an elementary function {{of the size of the}} input MSO formula. This non-elementary complexity is necessary, in the sense that (unless P = NP) it is not possible to test MSO properties on trees in a time that is fixed-parameter <b>tractable</b> with an elementary dependence on the parameter.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{situation}} becomes more <b>tractable</b> for simply connected smooth manifolds of dimension ≥ 5, where the h-cobordism theorem {{can be used}} to reduce the classification to a classification up to homotopy equivalence, and surgery theory can be applied. This has been carried out to provide an explicit classification of simply connected 5-manifolds by Dennis Barden.|$|E
25|$|As {{previously}} noted, learning Bayesian networks with bounded treewidth {{is necessary}} to allow exact <b>tractable</b> inference, since the worst-case inference complexity is exponential in the treewidth k (under the exponential time hypothesis). Yet, being a global property of the graph, it considerably increases {{the difficulty of the}} learning process. In this context it is possible to use the concept of K-tree for effective learning.|$|E
25|$|The {{black holes}} that Strominger and Vafa {{considered}} {{in their original}} work were quite different from real astrophysical black holes. One difference was that Strominger and Vafa considered only extremal black holes {{in order to make}} the calculation <b>tractable.</b> These are defined as black holes with the lowest possible mass compatible with a given charge. Strominger and Vafa also restricted attention to black holes in five-dimensional spacetime with unphysical supersymmetry.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem of}} testing whether a given graph is k {{vertices}} away and/or t edges {{away from a}} cograph is fixed-parameter <b>tractable.</b> Deciding if a graph can be k-edge-deleted to a cograph can be solved in O*(2.415k) time, and k-edge-edited to a cograph in O*(4.612k). If the largest induced cograph subgraph of a graph can be found by deleting k vertices from the graph, {{it can be found}} in O*(3.30k) time.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem of}} finding a minimum vertex cover is a {{classical}} optimization problem in computer science and is a typical example of an NP-hard optimization problem that has an approximation algorithm. Its decision version, the vertex cover problem, was one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems and is therefore a classical NP-complete problem in computational complexity theory. Furthermore, the vertex cover problem is fixed-parameter <b>tractable</b> and a central problem in parameterized complexity theory.|$|E
25|$|An {{exhaustive}} search algorithm can {{solve the problem}} in time 2kn'O(1). Vertex cover is therefore fixed-parameter <b>tractable,</b> {{and if we are}} only interested in small k, we can solve the problem in polynomial time. One algorithmic technique that works here is called bounded search tree algorithm, and its idea is to repeatedly choose some vertex and recursively branch, with two cases at each step: place either the current vertex or all its neighbours into the vertex cover.|$|E
