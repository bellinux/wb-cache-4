500|$|In this formalism, {{a liquid}} crystal {{material}} {{is treated as}} a continuum; molecular details are entirely ignored. Rather, this theory considers perturbations to a presumed oriented sample. The <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> the liquid crystal are commonly described by the Frank free energy density. One can identify three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortions</b> that could occur in an oriented sample: (1) twists of the material, where neighboring molecules are forced to be angled with respect to one another, rather than aligned; (2) splay of the material, where bending occurs perpendicular to the director; and (3) bend of the material, where the distortion {{is parallel to the}} director and molecular axis. All three <b>of</b> these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortions</b> incur an energy penalty. They are distortions that are induced by the boundary conditions at domain walls or the enclosing container. The response of the material can then be decomposed into terms based on the elastic constants corresponding to the three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortions.</b> Elastic continuum theory is a particularly powerful tool for modeling liquid crystal devices [...] and lipid bilayers.|$|R

5000|$|Welding {{methods that}} involve the melting of metal {{at the site}} of the joint {{necessarily}} are prone to shrinkage as the heated metal cools. Shrinkage then introduces residual stresses and distortion. Distortion can pose a major problem, since the final product is not the desired shape.

5000|$|Clipping is a {{non-linear}} {{process that}} produces frequencies not originally {{present in the}} audio signal. These frequencies can be harmonic overtones, meaning they are whole number multiples {{of one of the}} signal's original frequencies, or [...] "inharmonic", resulting from general intermodulation distortion. [...] The same nonlinear device will produce both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortion,</b> depending on the input signal. Intermodulation occurs whenever the input frequencies are not already harmonically related. For instance, playing a power chord through distortion results in intermodulation that produces new subharmonics.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} compare {{different}} <b>types</b> <b>of</b> quality <b>distortions,</b> it seems appropriate {{to use a}} test methodology that is independent of vocabulary and scales.

30|$|The {{past five}} years have {{witnessed}} the emergence of various new BIQA algorithms (Saad et al. 2012; Moorthy and Bovik 2011; Mittal et al. 2012 a; Mittal et al. 2012 b; Mittal et al. 2012 c; Mittal et al. 2013; He et al. 2012; Ye and Doermann 2012; Moorthy and Bovik 2010; Sheikh et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2002; Ciancio and da Costa 2011; Gao et al. 2009; Brandao and Queluz 2008; Jung et al. 2002; Charrier et al. 2006). These BIQA metrics can be broadly divided into two categories: the distortion-specific metrics and the universal metrics. The former means the BIQA metrics can only work on a specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortion</b> or the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortion</b> should be given before using the metrics (Sheikh et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2002; Ciancio and da Costa 2011). In contrast, the universal BIQA metrics can work on various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortions</b> without given the information <b>of</b> <b>distortions</b> (Saad et al. 2012; Moorthy and Bovik 2011; Mittal et al. 2012 a; Mittal et al. 2012 b; Mittal et al. 2012 c; Mittal et al. 2013; He et al. 2012; Ye and Doermann 2012; Moorthy and Bovik 2010). Since we aim to construct a universal BIQA metric in this paper, a compact introduction of the state-of-the-art universal BIQA metrics is given below.|$|R
50|$|Harmonic {{distortion}} adds overtones {{that are}} whole number multiples {{of a sound}} wave's frequencies. Nonlinearities {{that give rise to}} amplitude distortion in audio systems are most often measured in terms of the harmonics (overtones) added to a pure sinewave fed to the system. Harmonic distortion may be expressed in terms of the relative strength of individual components, in decibels, or the root mean square of all harmonic components: Total harmonic distortion (THD), as a percentage. The level at which harmonic distortion becomes audible depends on the exact nature of the distortion. Different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortion</b> (like crossover distortion) are more audible than others (like soft clipping) even if the THD measurements are identical. Harmonic distortion in radio frequency applications is rarely expressed as THD.|$|E

40|$|Undetected {{confounding}} may severely {{distort the}} effect of an explanatory variable on a response variable, as defined by a stepwise data-generating process. The best known type of distortion, which we call direct confounding, arises from an unobserved explanatory variable common to a response and its main explanatory variable of interest. It is relevant mainly for observational studies, since it is avoided by successful randomization. By contrast, indirect confounding, which we identify in this paper, is an issue also for intervention studies. For general stepwise-generating processes, we provide matrix and graphical criteria to decide which <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortion</b> may be present, when they are absent {{and how they are}} avoided. We then turn to linear systems without other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortion,</b> but with indirect confounding. For such systems, the magnitude of distortion in a least-squares regression coefficient is derived and shown to be estimable, so that it becomes possible to recover {{the effect of}} the generating process from the distorted coefficient.

30|$|We {{verify the}} {{proposed}} GMVP on two publicly available databases: CSIQ database [33] and TID 2008 database [34]. It {{should be noted}} that we consider the distortion images as transmitted images because the images will degenerate when they are transmitted by sensor networks. The CSIQ database consists of 886 transmitted images and 30 reference images. The transmitted images contains six <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortions</b> at five different distortion levels. Concretely, the six <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortions</b> involve JPEG compression, JPEG 2000 compression, Gaussian blur (GB), additive white noise (AWN), additive pink Gaussian noise (APGN), and global contrast decrements (GCD). The TID 2008 database has 1700 transmitted images and 25 reference images with 17 kinds <b>of</b> <b>distortions</b> at 4 levels.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} a recently created image database, TID 2013, intended {{for evaluation of}} full-reference visual quality assessment metrics. With respect to TID 2008, the new database contains a larger number (3000) of test images obtained from 25 reference images, 24 <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortions</b> for each reference image, and 5 levels for each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortion.</b> Motivations for introducing 7 new <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortions</b> and one additional level <b>of</b> <b>distortions</b> are given; examples of distorted images are presented. Mean opinion scores (MOS) for the new database have been collected by performing 985 subjective experiments with volunteers (observers) from five countries (Finland, France, Italy, Ukraine, and USA). The availability of MOS allows {{the use of the}} designed database as a fundamental tool for assessing the effectiveness of visual quality. Furthermore, existing visual quality metrics have been tested with the proposed database and the collected results have been analyzed using rank order correlation coefficients between MOS and considered metrics. These correlation indices have been obtained both considering the full set of distorted images and specific image subsets, for highlighting advantages and drawbacks of existing, state of the art, quality metrics. Approaches to thorough performance analysis for a given metric are presented to detect practical situations or distortion types for which this metric is not adequate enough to human perception.

A total of 4990 consonants including selected occurrences of /d/, /g/, /t/, /k/ and /s/ in CV word-initial syllables, and /t/ in CV word medial and IP initial position were examined manually.

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of general-purpose no-reference approaches to image quality assessment still lags {{recent advances in}} full-reference methods. Additionally, most no-reference or blind approaches are distortion-specific, meaning they assess only a specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortion</b> assumed present in the test image (such as blockiness, blur, or ringing).

Towards ameliorating this we introduce the BLIINDS index (BLind Image Integrity Notator using DCT Statistics) which is a no-reference approach to image quality assessment that does not assume a specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> the image.
