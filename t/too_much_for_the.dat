5|$|Rupert D'Oyly Carte {{refreshed}} {{the opera}} company's productions and added London seasons, beginning in 1919, {{as well as}} provincial and foreign tours. In 1948 Rupert died, leaving a strong company to his daughter Bridget D'Oyly Carte. However, the rising costs of mounting professional light opera without any government support eventually became <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> company. Bridget was forced to close the company in 1982. Nevertheless, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond, and Carte's vision of wholesome light operas that celebrate Great Britain endures.|$|E
5|$|In 1782, Prince Alfred was inoculated against smallpox. The {{sickness}} proved <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{child and}} in June {{he was taken}} to Deal with his governess Lady Charlotte Finch to recover. It was hoped that the sea air, bathing in the water, and horseback riding would improve his condition. While he was there, Alfred endeared himself to many, including an old woman whom he waved to. In spite of his charming disposition, he continued to break out in spots and his chest was troubling him. When he returned to Windsor in August 1782, the doctors inspected him and realized that the boy had only weeks to live. After suffering bouts of fever and continuing problems with his chest, Prince Alfred died on 20 August 1782, at Windsor Castle, Berkshire, not even two years old.|$|E
5|$|In June 1904, Beilhart {{invited the}} public to an 'open house' where he {{attempted}} to explain the motives and beliefs of the society. Over 400 people attended the gathering. Among them, it has been claimed, were Clarence Darrow and Elbert Hubbard but {{this has not been}} documented, although Beilhart is known to have visited Hubbard in East Aurora and Darrow was a frequent visitor to the society during the Chicago and Ingleside years. In the end, the society's rejection of marriage {{on the grounds that it}} made a 'slave of the woman', and the misinterpretations of their views on free-love were <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> people of Lisbon to accept. In late 1904, the group left Lisbon for Chicago, in the hope that their progressive ideas might be better tolerated there.|$|E

5|$|On February 13, the Kentucky House {{achieved}} a quorum, and the Senate did so the following day. Having lost {{the battle against}} the special session, Laffoon proposed a primary with a run-off if no candidate received a majority on the first ballot. Some, including Chandler, believed this action was aimed against former governor and senator J. C. W. Beckham, who Laffoon believed would challenge Rhea for the Democratic nomination. They believed that a double primary would be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> aging Beckham to endure. Supporters of a single primary found {{they did not have}} the votes in the legislature to pass it, so they agreed to a double primary, which Laffoon signed into law on February 27, 1935.|$|E
5|$|Despite these lean performances, Karthik was {{retained}} for the three-Test {{series at}} home to Pakistan in March. In a high-scoring draw in the First Test in Mohali, Karthik made only six as India amassed 516. Karthik then put on his best Test batting performance to this point, at Eden Gardens, Kolkata against Pakistan. India batted first and Karthik made a start and reached 28, before being run out. India made 407 and Pakistan almost broke even, replying with 393. In the second innings, Karthik scored, combining with Rahul Dravid in a 166-run partnership {{to set up a}} target of 422. This proved <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tourists on the deteriorating pitch and India won the match by 196 runs. In the next match, he made only 10 and 9 as India collapsed and lost ten wickets {{on the final day of}} an otherwise high-scoring match1280 runs had been scored for only 22 wickets in the first three innings.|$|E
5|$|Dumouriez {{crossed the}} Dutch {{frontier}} on 16 February 1793. The fortress of Breda fell {{after a quick}} siege from 21 to 24 February 1793. The 3,000 Dutch defenders, which included 2,500 infantry and a dragoon regiment, surrendered the city with its 250 cannon and were allowed to go free. Also on the 21st, Maastricht was invested by 10,000 troops of Miranda's army. There were 8,000 Austrian and Dutch defenders under Prince Karl Wilhelm Georg of Hesse-Darmstadt, an Austrian General-major. The siege work at Maastricht in winter weather was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> French volunteers and many deserted their units and went home. The fortress of Geertruidenberg with 150 guns capitulated after a siege from 1 to 4 March. The Dutch garrison of two battalions and two squadrons were allowed to go free. Both Breda and Geertruidenberg had been bluffed into giving up by the military engineer Jean Claude le Michaud d'Arcon, who had designed the floating batteries at the Great Siege of Gibraltar. A small fort at Klundert was captured on 4 March by 4,000 men under Berneron. The tiny garrison put up a stiff fight and lost 60 killed before the 73 survivors gave up.|$|E

5|$|F. Augustus Heinze's {{association}} with the corner and the insolvent State Savings Bank proved <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> board of the Mercantile to accept. Although they forced him to resign before lunch time, {{by then it was}} too late. As news of the collapse spread, depositors rushed en masse to withdraw money from the Mercantile National Bank. The Mercantile had enough capital to withstand a few days of withdrawals, but depositors began to pull cash from the banks of the Heinzes' associate Charles W. Morse. Runs occurred at Morse's National Bank of North America and the New Amsterdam National. Afraid of the impact the tainted reputations of Augustus Heinze and Morse could have on the banking system, the New York Clearing House (a consortium of the city's banks) forced Morse and Heinze to resign all banking interests. By the weekend after the failed corner, there was not yet systemic panic. Funds were withdrawn from Heinze-associated banks, only to be deposited with other banks in the city.|$|E
5|$|In Super Bowl XLVIII, Manning's Broncos {{lost to the}} Seattle Seahawks by a {{score of}} 43–8. Manning was up against the Seahawks' young {{starting}} quarterback Russell Wilson, who idolized Manning and attended one of Manning's passing camps as a teenager, and later met Manning at a Broncos pre-draft interview. The Seahawks' number one ranked defense proved <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Broncos' number one ranked offense to overcome, while the Broncos' defense also struggled due to injuries. The Broncos' first play from scrimmage {{set the tone for}} the game. While Manning was stepping forward to call an audible, center Manny Ramirez snapped the ball too early and it flew past Manning's head into the end zone, where running back Knowshon Moreno downed it for a safety. Manning set a Super Bowl record with 34 completions (broken by Tom Brady the following year in Super Bowl XLIX), but the record-setting offense did not record a first down until the second quarter, and did not score any points until the final seconds of the third quarter. While Manning threw one touchdown pass and one successful two-point conversion, he also threw two costly interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} period many {{thousands}} of country houses of great architectural value were demolished, or had whole wings razed to the ground. In 1955 alone one house was demolished every five days. In this respect Belton was fortunate to survive at all, as {{in addition to the}} family's problems, the house deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} in 1961 the 6th Baron employed the architect Francis Johnson to oversee a large restoration program lasting three years. Not only was the roof repaired but much of the panelling taken down and repaired, and new cornices installed. Also attempts were made to curtail serious infestations of dry rot. By the time of the death of the 6th Baron in 1978, the resultant death duties, coupled with the rising costs of the upkeep, made Belton <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Brownlow family.|$|E

5|$|Payne {{drew up a}} {{compromise}} bill, in which the Resumption Act would be repealed and replaced with a gradual, partial return to gold-backed money. Under the Payne Act, national banks {{would be required to}} build up gold reserves equal to three percent of the value of greenbacks in circulation that year, adding an additional three percent each year until 1885, when they would have gold reserves of thirty percent of the value of circulating greenbacks. At that point, greenbacks would become redeemable in at least thirty percent gold. This compromise was still <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Democrats and Republicans who favored the gold standard, and the Banking Committee refused to approve the bill. Payne contrived to bypass his committee and bring the bill for a vote by the whole House, but it was voted down, 81 to 157. The House later passed a complete repeal of the Resumption Act, 133 to 120, but the Senate declined to take up the matter. Specie resumption remained {{the law of the land}} when the 44th Congress's term expired.|$|E
5|$|Periods of rain {{impacted}} the British Isles {{early in}} the morning of 10 January, progressing from west to east. Wet and windy weather was seen across the region during the day, with a wintry mix of precipitation falling across northern sections of Britain. Within the area of wintry mix, the wind combined with the ongoing snowfall led to blizzards across most of Scotland. Precipitation became more showery in nature during the evening hours. Thunderstorms were observed despite the near-freezing temperature readings. Wind and waves associated with this storm were <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tanker MV Braer, which had become lodged on rocks in the Shetland Islands nearly a week beforehand. The tanker broke up and her remaining cargo of 84,500tons of light crude oil spilled into the ocean surrounding the islands. The rough conditions caused by this storm led to the rapid breakup of visible oil slicks.|$|E
5|$|The {{attempts}} {{to relieve the}} citadel ended in farce. Badly-drilled reinforcements sent by the Habsburgs fled in the fear of Turks, and their {{attempts to}} re-board their boats at Solin bay caused many vessels to sink. Niccolo dalla Torre and the papal commissioner managed to escape. Kružić himself– who had left the fortress {{to make contact with}} the reinforcements was captured and executed: the sight of his head on a stick was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remaining defenders of Klis, who were now willing to give up the fortress in return for safe passage north. After Petar Kružić's death, and with a lack of water supplies, the Klis defenders finally surrendered to the Ottomans in exchange for their freedom, on March 12, 1537. Many of the citizens fled the town, while the Uskoci retreated to the city of Senj, where they continued fighting the Turkish invaders.|$|E

5|$|Zosimus {{provides}} the lengthiest {{account of the}} games (at Historia Nova 2.1–7), but does not mention Philip. The games had a starring role in Zosimus' scheme of Roman history. To him, the fortune of the empire was intimately related {{to the practice of}} the traditional civic rites. Any emperor who revived or supported those rites—Augustus, Claudius, Domitian, Septimius Severus—earns Zosimus' credit, while the emperor who ended them, Constantine I, earns his condemnation. All the misfortune of the 4th century can be directly attributed to Constantine's discontinuation of the old rites. In this context, Shahîd argues, Zosimus' silence on Philip's Christianity and Philip's involvement in the games makes sense. First, it would have given lie to his thesis on that the practice of the traditional rites guaranteed the fortunes of empire, since the period following the games was hardly a happy one (and this argument remains valid even if both Philip's Christianity and Zosimus' awareness of the tradition is denied). And second, it would have dulled his attack on Constantine by disentangling the potent alignment between imperial disaster, Christianity, and the traditional cult. The last emperor to celebrate the games was also the first emperor to embrace Christianity. The incongruity of this fact proved <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> historian to handle, so he ignored it.|$|E
