40|$|ACKNOWLEDGMENTS First, I {{would like}} to thank my thesis advisor Dr. Mary Munson for her guidance. I learned many things from her, about science, research, academia, and myself. Additionally, I {{would like to}} thank the members of my thesis {{advisory}} committee Drs. Celia Schiffer, Reid Gilmore, Peter Pryciak, and Dan Bolon for their guidance, insight, advice, and assistance over the years. I would also like to extend a heartfelt thanks to my coworkers, Jen and Melonnie. To Melonnie, <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>talking</b> about the forbidden subjects of religion and politics with me, and for the innumerable conversations, ranging from the deeply scientific to the deeply ridiculous. And of course, thank you for your frequent advice on all manner of subjects and the advanced training in the fine art of sarcasm. Lab wouldn’t have been nearly as enjoyable without you. Jen, we’ll miss you. Your mark is left indelibly on our lab, and on all our projects, and we feel the loss of you daily. We miss your advice, your outlook on life, and your keen insight. Don’t worry, we’ll find the opener and the anchor...|$|E
6000|$|I {{must tell}} you at once all the {{pleasure}} your beautiful and generous letter of the 23rd September has given me. It's a genuine joy to have from you so straight the delightful truth of the whole matter, and I can't <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> enough <b>for</b> <b>talking</b> to me with an exquisite young confidence and treating me as the fond and faithful and intensely participating old uncle that I want to be. It makes me feel--all you say--how right I've been to be glad, and how righter still I shall be to be myself confident. How shall I tell you in return what an interest I am going to take in you--and how I want <b>you</b> to multiply <b>for</b> me the occasions of showing it? You see I take the greatest and tenderest interest in Bill--and you and I feel then exactly together about that. We shall do--always more or less together!--everything {{we can think of}} to help him and back him up, and we shall find nothing more interesting and more paying. I expect somehow or other to see a great deal of him--and of you; and count on you to bring him out to me on the very first pretext, and on him to bring you. He is splendidly serious and entier; it's a great thing to be as entier as that. And he has great ability, great possibilities, which will take, and so much reward, all the bringing out and wooing forth and caring and looking out for that we can give them--as faith and affection can do these things; though of a certainty they would go their own way in spite of us--the fine powers would--if, unluckily for us, they didn't appeal to us. I like to think of you working out your ideas--planning all those possibilities together--in the wondrous Chocorua October--where I hope you are staying to the end--and even if intensity at the studio naturally suffers for the time it has only fallen back a little to gather again for the spring. I mean in particular the intensity of which you were the subject and centre, and which must have at first been somewhat hampered by its own very excess. Bill's only danger is in his tendency to be intensely intense--which {{is a bit of a}} waste; if one is intense (and it's the only thing for an artist to be) one should be economically, that is carelessly and cynically so: in that way one limits the conditions and tangles of one's problem. But don't give Bill this for a specimen of the way you and I are going to pull him through: we shall do much better yet--only it's past, far past, midnight and the deep hush of the little old sleeping town suggests bed-time rather as the great question for the moment. I have come back to this admirable small corner with great joy and profit--and oh, dear Alice, how earnestly you are awaited here at some not really distant hour by your affectionate old uncle, ...|$|R
