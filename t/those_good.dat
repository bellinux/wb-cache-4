5|$|Merit can {{be gained}} {{in a number}} of ways, such as giving, virtue and mental development. In addition, there are many forms of merit-making {{described}} in ancient Buddhist texts. A similar concept of kusala (Sanskrit: kusala) is also known, which is different from merit in some details. The most fruitful form of merit-making is <b>those</b> <b>good</b> deeds done with regard to the Triple Gem, that is, the Buddha, his teachings, the Dhamma (Sanskrit: Dharma), and the Sangha. In Buddhist societies, a great variety of practices involving merit-making has grown throughout the centuries, sometimes involving great self-sacrifice. Merit has become part of rituals, daily and weekly practice, and festivals. In addition, there is a widespread custom of transferring merit to one's deceased relatives, of which the origin is still a matter of scholarly debate. Merit has been that important in Buddhist societies, that kingship was often legitimated through it, and still is.|$|E
25|$|Indulgences were {{introduced}} {{to allow for the}} remission of the severe penances of the early Church and granted at the intercession of Christians awaiting martyrdom or at least imprisoned for the faith. They draw on the treasury of merit accumulated by Christ's superabundantly meritorious sacrifice on the cross and the virtues and penances of the saints. They are granted for specific good works and prayers in proportion to the devotion with which <b>those</b> <b>good</b> works are performed or prayers recited.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{necessary}} for the seeker to have a correct creed (Aqidah), and to embrace with certainty its tenets. The seeker must also, of necessity, turn away from sins, love of this world, the love of company and renown, obedience to satanic impulse, and the promptings of the lower self. (The way in which this purification of the heart is achieved is outlined in certain books, but must be prescribed in detail by a Sufi master.) The seeker must also be trained to prevent the corruption of <b>those</b> <b>good</b> deeds which have accrued {{to his or her}} credit by overcoming the traps of ostentation, pride, arrogance, envy, and long hopes (meaning the hope for a long life allowing us to mend our ways later, rather than immediately, here and now).|$|E
5000|$|Hyperconsumerism, hyper-consumerism, hyper{{consumption}} or hyper-consumption {{refer to}} the consumption of goods for non-functional purposes and the associated significant pressure to consume <b>those</b> <b>goods</b> exerted by the modern, capitalist society, as <b>those</b> <b>goods</b> shape one's identity.

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, the Indiana Railroad {{was able}} to interchange passengers and considerable freight with the very busy Cincinnati and Lake Erie interurban in Ohio, but the financially very weak Dayton and Western interurban was the essential rail link between the two companies. The 53 mile D tied into IR tracks at its west end at Richmond, Indiana, and into C tracks at its eastern end at Dayton, Ohio. The D connection allowed the IR to ship freight from Indiana to Dayton, and from there on the C north to Toledo and Cleveland, south to Cincinnati, and east to Columbus. Like many interurbans, the Dayton and Western struggled financially into the 1930s. Its track ran adjacent to the new U.S. Route 40 highway between Richmond and Dayton, and as the 1920s passed, the Dayton and Western crews apprehensively watched {{as more and more}} of their business moved onto that highway in the form of cars, trucks, and buses. From 1931 to 1933, the Cincinnati & Lake Erie leased the D to prop it up, and later in 1936, the IR took over the lease, but in May 1937 it had to drop the lease for lack of funds. Thus the D was forced to abandon operations. The resulting loss of revenue business to Ohio wounded the IR. In the good national economy of the early 1920s, the Terre Haute, Indianapolis, & Eastern (the predecessor to the IR on the Indianapolis to Richmond route) had combined with the D to run well-patronized express passenger interurbans and to interchange considerable freight the entire 108 miles between Dayton and Indianapolis, but <b>those</b> <b>good</b> days were over by the late 1920s.|$|E

In comparison {{to his first}} album, Saadiq regarded Ray Ray as [...] "more aggressive, more radio-friendly ... one of <b>those</b> <b>good,</b> Saturday-playing records".

500|$|In July 2006, while Soulfly was on tour, Max {{received}} a call from his brother, {{and by the end of}} the conversation, Max had invited Igor to visit him in Phoenix for the tenth anniversary of D-Low, an annual memorial show for Dana. At the concert, Igor joined Soulfly and performed two Sepultura songs, [...] "Roots Bloody Roots" [...] and [...] "Attitude," [...] for which Dana had written the lyrics. In an interview with Chad Bowar for About.com, Max stated that performance was [...] "the birth of Cavalera Conspiracy". After the show, Max suggested they begin a new project after Soulfly finished touring. Max confessed to Bowar that he had lied to Igor when he said all the songs were ready when he had only finished one. He added, [...] "It was one of <b>those</b> <b>good</b> lies. Everything rolled from there. What I like about the Conspiracy is that nothing is really planned. One thing leads to another. There's no pressure and it feels like a different project than anything I've done." ...|$|E

Goods that require inputs that are locally abundant are cheaper to produce than <b>those</b> <b>goods</b> that require inputs that are locally scarce.|$|R

500|$|Capitol Records {{executives}} {{were worried that}} the lyrics contained psychedelic overtones, and Brian was accused of having based the song's production on his LSD experiences. Brian clarified that the song was written {{under the influence of}} marijuana, not LSD. He explained: [...] "I made ‘Good Vibrations’ on drugs; I used drugs to make that. ... I learned how to function behind drugs, and it improved my brain ... it made me more rooted in my sanity." [...] In Steven Gaines's 1986 biography, Wilson is quoted on the lyrics: [...] "We talked about good vibrations with the song and the idea, and we decided on one hand that you could say ... those are sensual things. And then you'd say, 'I'm picking up good vibrations,' which is a contrast against the sensual, the extrasensory perception that we have. That's what we're really talking about." [...] Brian claimed in 2012 that the song's [...] "gotta keep <b>those</b> <b>good</b> vibrations" [...] bridge was inspired by Stephen Foster. Al Jardine of the Beach Boys compared the section to Foster's [...] "Down by the Riverside". According to Love, the lyric [...] "'she goes with me to a blossom world' was originally meant to be followed by the words 'we find'", but Brian elected to cut off the line to highlight the bass track linking into the chorus.|$|E
500|$|Marvel Studios {{developed}} specific {{business practices}} to create its shared universe, including choosing filmmakers that were considered [...] "out-of-left-field", given their previous work. Feige remarked, [...] "You don't {{have to have}} directed a big, giant visual-effects movie to do a big, giant visual-effects movie for us. You just have to have done something singularly sort of awesome," [...] adding [...] "It's worked out well for us when we've taken people [...] that have done very, very good things. Very rarely are one of <b>those</b> <b>good</b> things a big giant blockbuster superhero movie." [...] When hiring directors, the studio usually has [...] "a kernel of {{an idea of what}} we want", which is presented to potential directors {{over the course of several}} meetings to discuss and further expand. [...] "And if over the course of three or four or five meetings they make it way better than what we initially were spewing to them, they usually get the job", according to Feige. Later expanding on this process, Feige explained that before talking to any directors on a film, Marvel Studios often puts together a [...] "lookbook" [...] of influences from the comics and art by Marvel's visual development department, to create a visual template for the film. These are put together at company retreats, which the studio holds every [...] "18 months or so" [...] to plan out and develop the phases of the MCU. These lookbooks are not always shown to directors, though, with Marvel sometimes preferring to let the director offer their own ideas first.|$|E
500|$|Lage Raho Munna Bhai was an {{acclaimed}} film. Subhash K. Jha {{said that}} [...] "Munna and Circuit, arguably cinema's most adorable and roguish reformists since Laurel and Hardy go {{about the business}} of generating humour out of the pathos of the human condition. The sequences, all fiercely and famously path-breaking have us in splits [...] Watch the love-lorn Munnabhai answer a Gandhian quiz on a phone-in radio quiz with the help of kidnapped professors' it's one of the most comically animated sequences seen in the movies of the new millennium." [...] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film four out five stars, calling it [...] "a sparkling example of qualitative cinema" [...] arguing that it [...] "not only entertains, it also enlightens." [...] Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India observes that [...] "Vidhu Vinod Chopra gives the great Indian family one more let's-go-goodwill-hunting entertainer, even as director Raju Hirani proves that sequels needn't have the been there-done that feel..." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it four out of five stars and states: [...] "Like <b>those</b> <b>good</b> old-fashioned Hrishikesh Mukherjee films, it also reinforces the importance of human goodness and basic niceties. Even if you might argue that some of Gandhi's principles seem outdated today, you cannot help but cheer for Munna and his gang as they achieve the impossible with love and kindness. And that is where this film transcends conventional boundaries. It entertains you, yes, but it also makes you yearn for a perfect world. Judge it by any yardstick that you may, Lage Raho Munnabhai emerges a clear winner. Much of that credit must go to its actors who pull out all stops to make it an enjoyable ride." [...] Poonam Joshi of the BBC gave four out of five stars stating that, [...] "everything about this film works [...] It's rare to see a film that bounces between humour and sentiment so seamlessly. And it is rarer still to see characters become etched in the memory so enduringly that audiences become almost protective of them. It's testimony both {{to the quality of the}} writing and the performances, that Munna and Circuit have taken on a life of their own." [...] Vinayak Chakravorty of The Hindustan Times gave four out of four stars stating that it [...] "cleverly works its way around the obvious hurdle that almost all sequels face: The film recreates an original milieu without a hint of the déjà vu downer. And that precisely ranks Munna Bhai 2 as one of the best entertainers this year." [...] He commended the it for showing [...] "the heights Hindi cinema can scale despite staying within its masala parameters. Lage [...] raho, guys." ...|$|E
25|$|In economics, many {{problems}} involve multiple objectives along with constraints on what combinations of those objectives are attainable. For example, consumer's demand for various goods {{is determined by}} the process of maximization of the utilities derived from <b>those</b> <b>goods,</b> subject to a constraint based on how much income is available to spend on <b>those</b> <b>goods</b> and on the prices of <b>those</b> <b>goods.</b> This constraint allows more of one good to be purchased only at the sacrifice of consuming less of another good; therefore, the various objectives (more consumption of each good is preferred) are in conflict with each other. A common method for analyzing such a problem is to use a graph of indifference curves, representing preferences, and a budget constraint, representing the trade-offs that the consumer is faced with.|$|R

2500|$|Bradman's playing {{philosophy}} – that cricket {{should not}} be a career, and that <b>those</b> <b>good</b> enough could profit from other avenues – also seems to have borne on his approach to administration. Biographers have disserved Bradman in glossing over his years in officialdom. His strength and scruples over more than three decades were exemplary; the foremost master of the game became its staunchest servant. But he largely missed the secular shift toward the professionalisation of sport in the late '60s and early '70s, which finally found expression in Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket...Discussing Packer, Bradman told biographer Charles Williams in January 1995 he '"accepted that cricket had to become professional" ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of the 2005 SPM results in March 2006, the Education Ministry {{announced}} it was considering reforming the SPM system due to what was perceived as over-emphasis on As.

He complained that [...] "They don't understand what I am saying. ... I cannot communicate with them." [...] He claimed that [...] "Before 1957 (the year of independence), school heroes were not those with 8As or 9As, they were the great debaters, <b>those</b> <b>good</b> in drama, in sport, and those leading the Scouts and Girl Guides." [...] A former Education Director-General, Murad Mohd Noor, agreed, saying that [...] "The rat race now begins at Standard 6 with the UPSR, with the competition resulting in parents forcing their children to attend private tuition." [...] He also expressed dismay at the prevalence of students taking 15 or 16 subjects for the SPM, calling it [...] "unnecessary".|$|E
