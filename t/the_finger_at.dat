25|$|A {{serious effort}} was made in 1668 to secure a scheme of comprehension, with William Bates, Richard Baxter and Thomas Manton for the dissenters meeting Wilkins and Hezekiah Burton. Wilkins felt the Presbyterians could be brought within the Church of England, while the Independent separatists were left outside. It fell through by late summer, with Manton blaming John Owen for {{independent}} scheming for general toleration with Buckingham, and Baxter pointing <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> the House of Lords.|$|E
25|$|The show also covered {{many social}} issue storylines, {{including}} sexual assault, mental illness, and alcoholism. When Lorna was raped {{after a night}} of heavy drinking, viewers watched as she dealt with the aftermath of her brutal attack. She originally pointed <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> Morgan Winthrop (Grayson McCouch), but her rapist turned out to be Kyle Barkley (Roger Floyd). Cass and Frankie were devastated when their daughter, Charlie (Lindsay Fabes), became ill. Luckily, she recovered, but Cass had begun acting strangely. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which had been triggered by Charlie's illness. Again, viewers were informed: they learned both the symptoms of the illness and how to treat it by watching Cass see a counselor and start to take medication. Felicia had begun drinking heavily after Lucas's death, but she refused to call herself an alcoholic. After her friends staged an intervention, she found help through Alcoholics Anonymous.|$|E
25|$|Kargil War: R {{was heavily}} criticised in 1999, {{following}} the Pakistani incursions at Kargil. Critics accused R {{of failing to}} provide intelligence that could have prevented the ensuing ten-week conflict that brought India and Pakistan {{to the brink of}} a full-scale war. While the Army has been critical of the information they received R has pointed <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> the politicians, claiming they had provided all the necessary information. However, R was successful in intercepting a telephonic conversation between Pervez Musharraf, the then Pakistan Army Chief who was in Beijing and his chief of staff Lt. Gen. Mohammed Aziz in Islamabad. This tape was later published by India to prove Pakistani involvement in the Kargil incursion. In 2011, a think tank report stated that RAW had warned in its October 1998 assessment that Pakistan Army might launch a limited swift offensive with possible support of alliance partners, however the government ignored such reports.|$|E

500|$|The {{book has}} also been {{attacked}} {{for the quality of}} its journalism and research. The author admitted that much of the material came from the Internet and discharged the burden of proof by claiming that it was for the American government to refute the allegations rather than for him to prove them. This produced anger among authors using more conventional journalistic methods: [...] "The line in the sand is when respectable media and publishers start serving up fiction as truth," [...] was the response of Oliver Schrom (whose study of the 9/11 attacks pointed <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> intelligence failures, rather than a more spectacular claim of CIA complicity).|$|E
500|$|After Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) {{was pushed}} from the Lassiter's Hotel mezzanine, Mark was {{introduced}} {{as the lead}} detective on the case. Mark had his [...] "work cut out for him" [...] as he began questioning the suspects, as they each pointed <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> someone else. He also received conflicting information as everyone had their own suspicions as to who committed the crime. McGregor revealed that Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) had given Rebecca Robinson (Jane Hall) a false alibi, Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) points out that Diana Marshall (Jane Badler) earring was found {{at the crime scene}} and Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith) did not help himself with his attitude towards the investigation. Of the case, McGregor said [...] "Brennan is {{in the thick of the}} investigation so it's pretty exciting, I've never had so much responsibility." [...] McGregor later explained that it had been [...] "great" [...] to be involved in the storyline, even though he did not share many scenes with Dennis, as he was in a hospital bed. Rebecca was revealed to have been the one who pushed Paul and McGregor said that he knew early on in the storyline that she was the culprit. However, Mark did not know that Rebecca was responsible as he had been thrown by the false alibis. McGregor later said that his first week on Neighbours, filming the Who Pushed P.R? storyline, had stuck in his mind as there were many long interview scenes he had to get through.|$|E

2500|$|Vibrato {{is a small}} {{oscillation}} in {{the pitch}} of a note, usually considered expressive. Harmonics played on the cello fall into two classes; natural and artificial. Natural harmonics are produced by lightly touching (but not depressing) the string with <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> certain places, and then bowing (or, rarely, plucking) the string. For example, the halfway point of the string will produce a harmonic that is one octave above the unfingered (open) string. Natural harmonics only produce notes {{that are part of}} the harmonic series on a particular string. Artificial harmonics (also called false harmonics or stopped harmonics), in which the player depresses the string fully with one finger while touching the same string lightly with another finger, can produce any note above middle C.|$|E

The embassy bombing was ordered by Sirojiddin Mukhtarov aka Abu Saloh who commands Katibat al Tawhid wal Jihad in Nusra Front alongside Uighurs in Syria.

2500|$|During a {{visit to}} the UK in April, the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, Rashida Manjoo, criticized the country's [...] "boys' club sexist culture".

She cited issues such the sexist portrayal of women in public, including the female nudity on Page Three of the Sun newspaper, bullying of girls in schools, and harassment in public spaces. Laura Bates, the founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, commented on Manjoo's criticisms calling them [...] "a wake-up call to recognise the depth and severity of the problem.

2500|$|According to Lee Kuan Yew, {{there were}} irreconciliable {{differences}} between the two from the outset, due to the UMNO's communal politics. [...] The racial riots in July 1964, triggered and intensified the political rift between PAP and UMNO. Communal politics was often the central theme of Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman’s speeches and he often pointed <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> the PAP leaders and Lee Kuan Yew for interfering in his political party’s decisions and for contesting in Malaya’s federal elections advocating for a non-communal politics. Furthermore, Tunku Abdul Rahman’s encouragement of racial tension and anti-PAP sentiments among Singaporean Malays made it difficult for the PAP to work with UMNO to forge good relations. Thus, these ideological differences on party politics and the outbreaks of the racial riots in 1964 were some of the important contributing factors which led to the eventual separation of Singapore from the Malayan, paving the way for Singapore’s independence in June 1965. Singapore was finally declared an independent and sovereign state on August 9, 1965.|$|E

Channel 5 ran a poll on their website asking viewers to predict who pushed Paul and over 10,000 votes were cast.
