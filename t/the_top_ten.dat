5|$|Astana's Vuelta {{was a quiet}} one. Vinokourov {{placed in}} <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>ten</b> of the opening {{individual}} time trial but he fell out of <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>ten</b> of the overall standings the next day due to a crash. Haimar Zubeldia's 18th-place finish on stage 8, which was the Vuelta's first high mountain stage, propelled him into eighth overall until the next day, when he lost time and fell to ninth. In stage 10, Vinokourov figured in a winning breakaway, but his poor positioning in the four-man sprint finish meant the stage victory went to 's Simon Gerrans. Before stage 12, Astana held ninth overall. They continued to hold it after the stage, but the rider in that position changed; Zubeldia had been in <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>ten,</b> but finished further behind stage winner Ryder Hesjedal than Daniel Navarro, so it was Navarro who was the team's highest-placed rider after the stage. After the next two stages, Navarro also fell from <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>ten,</b> and the team did not achieve anything further, with Navarro in 13th their highest-placed rider in the race's final standings.|$|E
