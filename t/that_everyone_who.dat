5|$|Aristocrates, who was {{commanding}} a regiment of hoplites in Piraeus, {{arrested the}} extremist general Alexicles; enraged, the extremist {{leaders of the}} 400 demanded action, and {{made a number of}} threats against Theramenes and his party. To their surprise, Theramenes volunteered to lead a force to rescue Alexicles; the leaders of the extremists acquiesced, and Theramenes set out to Piraeus, sharing his command with one other moderate and one extremist, Aristarchus. When Theramenes and his force arrived at Piraeus, Aristarchus, in a rage, exhorted the men to attack the hoplites who had seized Alexicles. Theramenes feigned rage as well, but when asked by the hoplites whether he thought that the fortification on Eetioneia was a good idea, he responded that if they wanted to pull it down, he thought that would be good. Calling out <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> wanted the 5,000 to govern instead of the 400, the hoplites set to work. Donald Kagan has suggested that this call was probably instigated by Theramenes' party, who wanted the 5,000 to govern; the hoplites tearing down the fortification might well have preferred a return to the democracy. Several days later, the Peloponnesian fleet approached Piraeus, but, finding the fortifications destroyed and the port well defended, they sailed on to Euboea. Several days later, the 400 were formally deposed and replaced by a government of the 5,000; the most extreme of the oligarchs fled the city.|$|E

His use of the term Antichrist follows that of the New Testament in not identifying a single personal Antichrist, but a class of people.|$|E

25|$|As Cyclops {{lifeboats}} {{were launched}} and got clear, Kersley {{and some of}} his officers remained aboard to ensure <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> was still alive had left. 29 minutes after the first attack U-123 fired a second torpedo from one of her stern tubes, which hit Cyclops port side. The ship immediately started to break up and sank within five minutes. Some of those remaining aboard managed to reach a liferaft that the Chief Officer had released only minutes before.|$|E
25|$|The Round Table is King Arthur's famed {{table in}} the Arthurian legend, around which he and his Knights congregate. As its name suggests, it has no head, {{implying}} <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> sits there has equal status. The table was first described in 1155 by Wace, who relied on previous depictions of Arthur's fabulous retinue. The symbolism of the Round Table developed over time; by {{the close of the}} 12th century it had come to represent the chivalric order associated with Arthur's court, the Knights of the Round Table.|$|E
25|$|Caresse {{spent some}} of her time while her husband, Bert Young, fell into a drunken stupor every night, {{churning}} out another 200 pages of pornography. In her diary, Nin observed <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> wrote pornography with her wrote out of a self that was opposite {{to his or her}} identity, but identical with his or her desire. Caresse grew up amid the social constraints imposed by her upper-class family in New York. She had a doomed and troublesome romanticism with Harry Crosby. She participated in a decade or more of intellectual lovers in Paris during the 1920s.|$|E

25|$|In The Horse and His Boy, Lewis {{uses the}} {{cultural}} settings of Narnia, Archenland, and Calormen {{to develop a}} theme of freedom in contrast to slavery.

500|$|The Daily Telegraph called Agnew and Murphy's effort, [...] "new {{heights of}} ingenuity".

500|$|The {{earliest}} medieval Poor Law was the Ordinance of Labourers {{which was}} issued by King Edward III of England on 18 June 1349, and revised in 1350. The ordinance was issued {{in response to}} the 1348–1350 outbreak of the Black Death in England, when an estimated 30–40% of the population had died. The decline in population left surviving workers in great demand in the agricultural economy of Britain. Landowners had to face the choice of raising wages to compete for workers or letting their lands go unused. Wages for labourers rose, and this forced up prices across the economy as goods became more expensive to produce. An attempt to rein in prices, the ordinance (and subsequent acts, such the Statute of Labourers of 1351) required <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> could work did; that wages were kept at pre-plague levels and that food was not overpriced. Workers saw these shortage conditions as an opportunity to flee employers and become freemen, so Edward III passed additional laws to punish escaped workers. [...] In addition, the Statute of Cambridge was passed in 1388 and placed restrictions on the movement of labourers and beggars.|$|E

50|$|The {{term was}} {{originally}} the French {{equivalent of the}} term laity, <b>that</b> is, <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> is not clergy.

This includes prohibitions on having a state religion, {{as well as for}} the government to endorse any religious position, be it a religion or atheism.|$|R

500|$|Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave American Tragedy 5 out of 5, {{particularly}} {{praising the}} band's choice to avoid duplicating their debut album, Swan Songs, and instead choosing to create a, [...] "darker, deeper, and far deadlier ride this time around." [...] Florino compared various {{elements of the}} album to the Wu Tang Clan and Nine Inch Nails, particularly comparing the album's production (which was done by various producers with executive producer Don Gilmore) to Nine Inch Nails' second album The Downward Spiral (1994). He also lauded {{the irony of the}} quality singing on, [...] "Apologize", combined with the lyrics, [...] "But we can harmonize, even if we sound like shit." [...] Florino concluded that, [...] "Hollywood Undead's genius lies—in that dangerous space between unforgettable and unsettling," [...] pointing this out in the track, [...] "Bullet", for it being the, [...] "sunniest and catchiest tune on American Tragedy," [...] while still telling, [...] "a potent and poignant tale of longing for suicide." [...] The other track Florino pointed out for being unforgettable is, [...] "Pour Me", calling it, [...] "an evil power ballad <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> hears it will feel." ...|$|E
500|$|The Legendary Axe {{received}} positive coverage {{upon its}} release. It was previewed by various video gaming magazines before its release. A preview from Electronic Gaming Monthly called the game [...] "a definite 10" [...] and [...] "one {{of the best}} video games we've ever played". In {{an overview of the}} PC Engine, VideoGames & Computer Entertainment referred to the game as [...] "characteristic of the PC Engine's advanced sound, graphics and game play". A later preview from the same magazine said {{that it was one of}} the console's better games, and they applauded the arcade-like graphics and gameplay. They said <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> owned the console should own the game and that it was an [...] "excellent showcase of the game system's capabilities". It was reviewed in Electronic Gaming Monthly in September1989. In the review, Steve Harris said it was one of his favorite games, praising its theme, graphics, sound, and execution; he added that its features were unsurpassed by any video game at the time. Ed Semrad used this game to criticize Rastan, saying The Legendary Axe [...] "is how [...] should have been done". He added that it should be the first game TurboGrafx-16 owners should buy. Donn Nauert called the game one of the best adventure games seen at the time and echoed Harris' praises. Jim Allee repeated Semrad's observation that the game is Rastan but with better graphics; he praised its detailed sprites, the diverse music and gameplay, and difficulty level and concluded that it [...] "is everything you could want in a game". Later in that issue Nauert presented a partial walkthrough of the game, where he further praised the game for breathing new life into the platformer genre. An abridged walkthough was published in VideoGames & Computer Entertainment in November1989.|$|E
