5|$|With {{the growth}} of {{settlement}} in Pearsall's Flats, which was later the location of Romney, the need for educational facilities became apparent and the community began plans {{for the establishment of}} schools and churches. A log structure, which served as both a school and a church, was built at Pearsall's Flats around 1752 near Fort Pearsall. To provide for a teacher's payment, a form was circulated around Romney and each parent indicated on the paper how many of their children would attend the school and the type of payment the <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> expect. By the time Romney was surveyed by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron laid out the town of Romney in 1762, the log school was still in existence. That year, a stone school building was erected on the site to the immediate north of the old Hampshire County Courthouse and became known as Romney Academy.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} report {{findings}} {{from a study}} designed to explore pre-service and in-service teachers’ rubric assessments of 4 th-grade student mathematics work samples. Pre-service and in-service elementary school teachers were recruited {{to participate in this}} survey-based research which included three hypotheses: (a) in-service <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> report greater confidence levels using rubrics and exhibit better attitudes toward assessment than pre-service teachers, (b) in-service <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> be more reliable in their rubric scores than pre-service teachers, and (c) in-service <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> identify greater differences than pre-service teachers in their evaluations of the work samples. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, and qualitative methods were employed...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to define}} teachers’ attitudes towards undesired behaviours at school. Therefore, in which possible undesired administrative behaviours <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> blow a whistle was examined. Second, whether the <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> prefer whistle-blowing or {{and the kind}} of blowing was questioned. Lastly, the reason of keeping silence was examined. This research was designed as qualitative model. The research group was 20 teachers that work at a secondary school in Darica district of Kocaeli. The results revealed that it was put forward that all <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> react in the case of various undesired behaviours. However it was determined that <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> mostly react in the case of serious undesired behaviours. Teachers mostly stated that they would prefer to whistle-blow internally, formally and by identifying themselves. Findings of the research are thought to contribute to the literature in terms of revealing teachers’ attitudes towards possible undesired behaviours at school...|$|R

25|$|Individuals {{formulate}} explanatory attributions {{to understand}} the events they experience and to seek reasons for their failures. When individuals seek positive feedback from their failures, they use the feedback as motivation to show improved performances. For example, using the intrapersonal perspective, a student who failed a test may attribute their failure for not studying enough and would use their emotion of shame or embarrassment as motivation to study harder for the next test. A student who blames their test failure on the <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> be using the interpersonal perspective, and would use their feeling of disappointment as motivation {{to rely on a}} different study source other than the teacher for the next test.|$|E
500|$|Ely {{began playing}} piano while still a young child, and was {{performing}} recitals {{all over the}} Portland area before his seventh birthday. When he was eleven, a piano teacher provided what he termed [...] "jazz improvisation lessons." [...] The <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> show Ely a section of a classical composition, and the boy {{would have to make}} up 15 similar pieces. He would be required to share each in class and then make up one on the spot.|$|E
500|$|Those who [...] "knowingly" [...] taught or {{asserted}} them as true {{would suffer}} automatic excommunication, with the implied {{threat of the}} medieval Inquisition if they persisted. [...] It is not known which of these statements were [...] "taught knowingly" [...] or [...] "asserted" [...] by teachers at Paris, although Siger of Brabant and his radical Averroist colleagues at the Faculty of Arts were targets. [...] Evidently, the radical masters had taught that Aristotle put forward controversial propositions — which according to the Averroists would have been true at least in philosophy, even if rejected in theology - the doctrine of two truths — and questions such as free will and the immortality of the soul were doubtless subject to scholarly debate between masters and students. [...] However, it seems [...] "inconceivable" [...] that any <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> deny God's Providence or present the Aristotelian [...] "Unmoved Mover" [...] as the true God.|$|E

500|$|A log structure, {{which served}} as both a school and a church, was built at Pearsall's Flats around 1752 near Fort Pearsall. During his travels in western Virginia in 1753, George Washington made mention of this structure. The log {{building}} was constructed of roughly hewn logs with clay chinking and contained puncheon log floors, hewn side up, clapboard doors, and one small window covered by a paper greased with lard. Light in the log structure {{was provided by the}} small window and a fireplace measuring [...] in height, which contained a tall pile of logs during the winter to provide for warmth in addition to lighting. The school's teachers were paid by subscriptions from the attending students. To provide for a teacher's payment, a form was circulated around Romney and each parent indicated on the paper how many of their children would attend the school and the type of payment the <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> expect, whether in the form of cash renumeration, produce, or boarding. These early teachers were usually [...] "wandering pedagogues, settling wherever they could obtain enough signers to insure a living".|$|E
500|$|The chorus {{talks about}} a woman “working at the pyramid tonight”. The track lyrically {{features}} intricate imagery that depicts a fantasy-like scenario, and the length gives the song the ability to change tempo with [...] "patience, with suave, like a furthering of the foreplay". The first half details an account of ancient history, [...] "even your junior high school social studies <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> blush over", with the second half containing a narrative where Ocean serves as Cleopatra’s pimp but through years of working together, he eventually {{falls in love with}} her. Through the [...] "unwritten bylaws of their profession", however, his love is no match for the [...] "rules of the game which were established long before he or she rose to power." [...] The narrative of [...] "Pyramids" [...] was inspired by real events in Ocean's life. When the singer lived in Los Angeles, he lived alongside pimps, and in an interview the singer mused that [...] "it was fantasy built off that dynamic … but you can only write what you know to a point." [...] The storytelling scope of the song has been compared favorably to Bob Dylan's [...] "The Hurricane", and has been described as an anthem [...] "for the Drake generation." ...|$|E
500|$|Ross {{was born}} Arnold Ephraim Chaimovich on August 24, 1906, in Chicago to Ukrainian-Jewish immigrants. He {{was an only}} child. His mother {{supported}} the family as a physical therapist. Ross returned to Odessa, Ukraine with his mother in 1909 for assistance from her extended family, and stayed once World War I and the Russian Revolution broke out. The two events led to widespread famine and economic woe in the region. Ross learned Russian {{at the behest of}} his mother, and developed a love of the theater and language. Ross's mother encouraged him to read, which he did often, and subscribed to a private library since Odessa had no public library. He credited his favorite uncle, an X-ray diagnostician, with introducing him to mathematics. The uncle had hired Samuil Shatunovsky to tutor his talented son, and Ross asked to join in. As money meant little due to inflation, Shatunovsky was paid to tutor the two boys with a pound of French hard candy. During this time, Ross was not taught with textbooks or lectured on geometric proofs. His geometry <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> ask the class to prove and justify ideas on the blackboard per trial and error. Many universities were closed due to the famine, but Odessa University reopened and let a small group of adolescents attend, including Ross.|$|E

40|$|Gender disproportionality {{in special}} {{education}} has been an issue for many years. This disproportionality is most apparent among students with emotional or behavioral disorders, where males make up approximately 75 % of the population. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine referral decisions of secondary regular education and special education teachers based on externalizing and internalizing behaviors associated with emotional/behavioral disorders. Results from two schools, urban and suburban, were compared based on teacher gender and area of expertise (regular education vs. special education). The hypotheses were: Externalizing behaviors would elicit more referrals; Females would refer more; Regular education <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> refer more for externalizing behaviors; and Special education <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> refer more for internalizing behaviors. In the urban school, the only hypothesis supported was that regular education <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> be more likely to refer for externalizing behaviors. In the suburban school, the only hypothesis not supported was that special education <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> be more likely to refer for internalizing behaviors. The urban and suburban characters of the schools, along with the differences in teacher' perceptions, ages, and years of experience, likely affect referral decisions. Given the implications of referral decisions, more research ofthese variables should be conducted.

500|$|Masashi Kishimoto {{originally}} intended for Kakashi to {{debut in the}} second chapter of the Naruto manga, appearing prior to {{the other members of}} Team 7. This Kakashi was designed as a laid back but very skilled ninja that ended his sentences with the polite [...] "de gozaru" [...] in the Japanese versions of the series. After speaking with his editor, Kishimoto pushed this debut back, allowing him to better develop Kakashi and the rest of Team 7. Despite this, Kakashi retains many of his original personality traits, being easygoing, unfazed by the actions of others, and eyes appearing to be half-asleep. Kishimoto feels that this makes Kakashi a compelling leader and helps to keep the diverse members of Team 7 unified. Early in the making of the series, Kakashi was designed as a samurai but he was not sure what the character would do in the manga. Thinking about how the protagonists' <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> behave, Kishimoto envisioned him as a rude adult. However, he was not happy with this type of personality so he rewrote it to a more laid back person. He found this portrayal funny but still made him hot-blooded for serious situations. As the manga continued, he changed his speech pattern and gave it a laid back touch, with kindness and a woman-like. There was no model for Kakashi; Kishimoto wanted to write a calm teacher who would help his students in complicated situations.|$|E
500|$|The Payne Study and Experiment Fund {{was created}} in 1927 by Frances Payne Bolton to support {{a study of the}} {{influence}} of fiction on children. The Payne Fund Studies, a series of eight books published from 1933 to 1935 which detailed five (5) years of research aimed specifically at the cinema's effects on children, were also gaining publicity at this time, and became a great concern to Hays. Hays had said certain pictures might alter [...] "... that sacred thing, the mind of a child … that clean, virgin thing, that unmarked state" [...] and have [...] "the same responsibility, the same care about the thing put on it that the best clergyman or the most inspired <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> have." [...] Despite its initial reception, the main findings of the study were largely innocuous. It found that cinema's effect on individuals varied with age and social position, and that pictures reinforced audiences' existing beliefs. The Motion Picture Research Council (MPRC, led by honorary vice president Sara Delano Roosevelt (mother of President Franklin D. Roosevelt), and executive director the Rev. William H. Short) which funded the study, was not pleased. An [...] "alarmist summary" [...] of the study's results written by Henry James Forman appeared in McCall's, a leading women's magazine of the time, and Forman's book, Our Movie Made Children, which became a best-seller, publicized the Payne Fund's results, emphasizing its more negative aspects.|$|E
2500|$|At {{some point}} {{prior to the}} actual test, the [...] "teacher" [...] was given a sample {{electric}} shock from the electroshock generator in order to experience firsthand what the shock that the [...] "learner" [...] would supposedly receive during the experiment would feel like. The [...] "teacher" [...] was then given a list of word pairs {{that he was to}} teach the learner. The teacher began by reading the list of word pairs to the learner. The <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> then read the first word of each pair and read four possible answers. The learner would press a button to indicate his response. If the answer was incorrect, the <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> administer a shock to the learner, with the voltage increasing in 15-volt increments for each wrong answer. If correct, the <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> read the next word pair.|$|E

[...] Leadbeater believed Krishnamurti to be the [...] "vessel" [...] for the indwelling of a concept known as World Teacher, whose imminent appearance he and many Theosophists were expecting.

2500|$|The {{two great}} rabbinical {{schools of the}} first pre-Christian century, the Shammaites and the Hillelites, debated the {{question}} whether life was worth living or not—"ṭob le-adam shenibra mishelo nibra" [...] (Er. 13b), {{and there was an}} unmistakable element of austerity in the teaching of many a Shammaite that favored asceticism (compare II Esdras iv. 12). While one <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> say, [...] "The Shekinah rests on man only amid cheerfulness that comes from duty well performed" [...] (Pes. ii. 7a), another held the view that [...] "there should be no unrestrained laughter in this world" [...] (Ber. 31a).|$|E
2500|$|The dissension between Franck's {{family and}} his circle of {{students}} reached a new height when Franck published Psyché (written 1886–88), a symphonic poem based on the Greek myth. [...] The controversy (not confined to Franck's immediate acquaintances) was not over the music, but over the philosophical and religious implications of the text (based on a poetic sketch by a certain Sicard and Louis de Fourcaud). Franck's wife and son found the work too sensual, and wanted Franck to concentrate on music wider and more popular in appeal [...] "and altogether more commercial". [...] D'Indy, on the other hand, speaks of its mystical significance, saying that it has [...] "nothing of the pagan spirit about it, [...] [...] [...] but, on the contrary, is imbued with Christian grace and feeling [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] D'Indy's interpretation was subsequently described as revealing [...] "some embarrassment, such as a newly timid Sunday-school <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> feel if abruptly called on to acquaint riotous adolescents with The Song of Solomon." ...|$|E

2500|$|Even {{as a boy}} Samuel {{displayed}} rare ability (Yer. Ketuvim v. 30a; Yer. Peah viii. 21b). His first {{teacher was}} an otherwise unknown man, and Samuel, who knew more about a certain legal question than did his <b>teacher,</b> <b>would</b> not submit to ill treatment by him (Ḥul. 107b). Then Samuel's father, who was himself a prominent teacher of the Law, recognized as such even by Rab (Abba Arika; Ket. 51b), undertook to instruct the boy. As {{he seems to have}} been unequal to this task he sent him to Nisibis to attend the school of the rabbi who had predicted the boy's birth, that he might there acquire a knowledge of the Law ("Tanya," [...] Hilkot [...] "Abel," [...] ed. Horowitz, p.137, quoted from Yer.; comp. also Mordecai on M. Ḳ. 889). Samuel seems to have remained only a short time at Nisibis. On his return to Nehardea he studied under Levi b. Sisi, who was in Babylon before the death of Judah ha-Nasi (see A. Krochmal in [...] "He-Ḥaluẓ," [...] i. 69), and who exerted a great influence on Samuel's development. Samuel made such rapid progress and became so proficient in his studies that he soon associated as an equal with his teacher (Hoffmann, [...] "Mar Samuel," [...] p.70).|$|E
2500|$|In one instance, the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District Board of Education {{encountered}} strong community {{opposition to}} establishing a Confucius Classroom at Cedarlane {{middle school in}} Hacienda Heights, which is [...] "a heavily Hispanic community with a majority-Chinese school board." [...] A San Gabriel Valley Tribune editorial compared this CI program as [...] "tantamount of asking Hugo Chavez to send his cadres to teach little American kids economics." [...] History teacher Jane Shults described criticisms of Confucius Classrooms as [...] "jingoistic, xenophobic, not overly rational and it’s really shades of McCarthyism." [...] One member of the Hacienda La Puente school board, Norman Hsu, said it wasn’t worth pushing the issue, since, without California credentials, the <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> not have been permitted to operate as a full-fledged instructor anyway. Another school board member, Jay Chen, characterized the Confucius Classroom scheme's opponents, [...] "What they all share in common, besides not having any children in the district (many don’t even live in the district), are steadfast accusations that the school board is trying to promote Communism in the classroom." [...] Chen concluded that xenophobic [...] "Anti-Sinoism" [...] was causing the Hacienda La Puente disagreements. University of Southern California public diplomacy professor Nicholas J. Cull said, [...] "I’m sure this will become a standard dispute. People in America are very suspicious of ideas from the outside." ...|$|E
2500|$|The typical {{structure}} of a chapter employing the Audio-Lingual-Method (ALM—and {{there was even a}} text book entitled ALM [...] ) was usually standardized as follows: 1. First item was a dialog in the foreign language (FL) to be memorized by the student. The <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> go over it the day before. 2. There were then questions in the FL about the dialog to be answered by the student(s) in the target language. 3. Often a brief introduction to the grammar of the chapter was next, including the verb(s) and conjugations. 4. The mainstay of the chapter was [...] "pattern practice," [...] which were drills expecting [...] "automatic" [...] responses from the student(s) as a noun, verb conjugation, or agreeing adjective was to be inserted in the blank in the text (or during the teacher's pause). The teacher could have the student use the book or not use it, relative to how homework was assigned. Depending on time, the class could respond as a chorus, or the teacher could pick individuals to respond. Julian Dakin, in 'The Language Laboratory and Language Learning' (Longman 1973), coined the phrase 'meaningless drills' to describe this kind of pattern practice, which others have also described as [...] "mimicry-memorization." [...] 5. There was a vocabulary list, sometimes with translations to the mother tongue. [...] 6. The chapter usually ended with a short reading exercise.|$|E
