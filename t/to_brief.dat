5|$|Although Cooper {{voted in}} favor of the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, he opposed {{escalating}} U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. As early as April 1964, Cooper was urging President Johnson to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the tensions in Southeast Asia. He questioned Southeast Asia's strategic importance to the U.S. and expressed concerns about the feasibility of deploying the U.S. military on a global scale. On March 25, 1965, he joined New York Senator Jacob Javits in a call for President Johnson to begin negotiations for a settlement between North Vietnam and South Vietnam without imposing preconditions on the negotiations. Later in the day, he introduced resolutions calling for Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara <b>to</b> <b>brief</b> the full Senate on recent developments in Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|General Trưởng was {{recalled}} to Saigon on 19 March <b>to</b> <b>brief</b> Thiệu on his withdrawal plan. The general developed two contingency plans: The {{first was}} predicated on government control of Highway 1, {{which would be}} utilized for two simultaneous withdrawals from Huế and Chu Lai to Da Nang; The second course presupposed PAVN interdiction of the highway {{and called for a}} withdrawal into three enclaves: Huế, Da Nang, and Chu Lai. This was to be only an interim measure, however, since the forces that withdrew to Huế and Chu Lai would then be sea-lifted to Da Nang by the navy. The president then stunned the general by announcing he misinterpreted his previous orders: The old imperial capital of Huế was not to be abandoned. Making matters worse, Trưởng discovered that his force was to be reduced by the removal of the Marine Division.|$|E

5|$|Lurie's script {{received}} a rewrite by Pamela Pettler, {{who worked with}} Burton on Corpse Bride, but the director hired Big Fish screenwriter John August in December 2003 to start from scratch. Both August and Burton were fans of the book since their childhoods. August first read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when he was eight years old, and subsequently sent Dahl a fan letter. He {{did not see the}} 1971 film prior to his hiring, which Burton believed would be fundamental in having August stay closer to the book. The writer updated the Mike Teavee character into an obsessive video game player, as compared to the novel, in which he fantasized about violent crime films. The characters Arthur Slugworth and Prodnose were reduced <b>to</b> <b>brief</b> cameo appearances, while Mr. Beauregarde was entirely omitted.|$|E
