25|$|The {{proof of}} the {{independence}} result also shows that a wide class of mathematical statements, including all statements that can be phrased {{in the language of}} Peano arithmetic, are provable in ZF if and only if they are provable in ZFC. Statements in this class include the statement that P = NP, the Riemann hypothesis, and many other unsolved mathematical problems. When one attempts to solve problems in this class, it makes no difference whether ZF or ZFC is employed if <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> the existence of a proof. It is possible, however, that there is a shorter proof of a theorem from ZFC than from ZF.|$|E

5000|$|Returning to {{the subject}} of Gibson's banged-up legs during a replay, Scully joked, [...] And, now, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>question</b> <b>was,</b> could he make it around the base paths unassisted?! ...|$|R
60|$|It {{would do}} {{no good to}} discuss {{the causes of the}} {{accident}} after it had occurred. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> as to how the damage could be repaired, and, after that was decided, to set about doing it at once.|$|R
2500|$|In June, 2008, Taguba {{was again}} in the {{headlines}} when he wrote the preface {{to a report by}} Physicians for Human Rights on prisoner [...] abuse and torture at Abu Ghraib prison, in Guantanamo Bay, and in Afghanistan. In it, he accused the Bush administration of committing war crimes and called for the prosecution of those responsible. He wrote, [...] "There is no longer any doubt that the current administration committed war crimes. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> whether those who ordered torture will be held to account." ...|$|E

60|$|The unruly weather, {{which became}} more and more tempestuous, {{rendered}} The hospitable suggestion unanswerable. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>question</b> <b>was,</b> whether such an unexpected accession of company, to an already crowded house, would not put the housekeeper to her trumps to accommodate them.|$|R
60|$|Erös Béla had the land. His {{father left}} him a dozen kataszter (land measure {{about two and}} three-quarter acres) or so; Elsa was the woman whom he loved, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> who--he or Andor--would {{be strong enough to}} gain the object of his desire.|$|R

50|$|With {{the end of}} apartheid, it was {{a foregone}} {{conclusion}} that the ANC would not <b>only</b> win <b>the</b> April 1994 general election—the country's first multiracial elections—but {{do so in a}} landslide. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> whether <b>the</b> ANC would win the two-thirds majority necessary to unilaterally amend the Interim Constitution.|$|R
6000|$|... 'To {{avoid having}} to tell you here, I suppose. Mary is for common wear, Verena is for ourselves.

60|$|Everybody {{of course}} was {{concerned}} to satisfy this wish of Gwendolen's, and Rex proposed that they should {{wind up with a}} tableau in which the effect of her majesty would not be marred by any one's speech.

50|$|Halfway {{into the}} race, it <b>was</b> clear that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> which American would win.

6000|$|He {{had tried}} to obtain the boy's release on the plea of his extreme youth, but the {{authorities}} were hotly exasperated, and would hear of no mercy.

6000|$|... "But {{human nature}} is so {{constituted}} that some means of expansion must be provided, or a violent explosion takes place. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> what means are most innocent.
