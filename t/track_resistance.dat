5000|$|On 1 August 2012, the Federal Railway Authority banned {{operations}} on a 15 km section between Halle and Bitterfeld after the Y-shaped steel sleepers {{installed in the}} slab track were so badly rusted that the <b>track</b> <b>resistance</b> was at risk. The ballasting of the sleepers and covering material to reduce noise meant that rain water was not drained away and led to corrosion. The problems with sleepers built in the mid-1990s meant that line speed limits were reduced from the original 160 km/h to 120 km/h and then to 50 or 30 km/h. Trains were diverted via Delitzsch.

50|$|On 3 November 1937 Hotchkiss {{presented}} {{the prototype of}} a tractor; on 10 December of a trailer. On both elements however the manufacturer had not done any testing, the vehicles having been transported to Vincennes {{as soon as they}} were finished. Therefore, the commission delayed its trials until 27 December to allow Hotchkiss to make final adjustments on the base area. The tractor was tested until 10 February 1938. The type closely resembled the general outline of the Renault UE. The main difference was the presence of two bins instead of one, able to tilt sideways, positioned over the back of the mudguards. This doubled the carrying capacity. Instead of the small hoods, two very large armoured covers, retractable to the back, served as both entrance hatch and visor. The engine, differential and steering system were judged to be acceptable. The suspension system however was considered to be too weak, not having been reinforced to match the larger cargo mass to avoid surpassing the specified total weight. It consisted of two bogies, each with two small road wheels, sprung by narrow horizontal coil springs. A large tension wheel trailed on the ground, which lowered ground pressure to compensate for the larger weight of the bins but also increased <b>track</b> <b>resistance</b> and vibration. The cross-country speed was just 15 km/h. As even during testing when fully loaded entire bogies collapsed, the prototype was rejected.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper aims to {{represents}} {{the investigation of}} surface <b>tracking</b> <b>resistance</b> of various types of cable insulations. Five kinds of cable material i. e. non carbon filled crosslink polyethylene (XLPE), carbon filled XLPE, low density polyethylene (LDPE), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), and high density polyethylene (HDPE) were examined. The test specimen has a dimension of 10 mm in width, 50. 8 mm in length and 1. 52 mm in thickness. The test samples were classified into two groups for investigation. The former group was the new test samples, whereas the latter test samples were stressed by thermal ageing with 120 oC for 168 hours. Then both specimens were examined. One side of the specimen was contacted with high voltage electrode terminal made of 1 mm diameter Nichrome wire. Another side of the test specimen was dipped into 0. 1 percent solution of ammonium chloride as grounded electrode. The spacing between electrodes at dry area was determined for 25. 4 mm. After completion of the test set up, AC high voltage {{was applied to the}} test specimen. The dip rate of the specimen into the solution was set up as 4 times per minute. The test voltage level was in the range of 1 - 3. 5 kV. The experiment was performed in accordance with ICEA S- 66 - 524 (Method B). The test voltage was applied to the test specimen until the insulation failure could be observed. Then, the insulation failure voltage and failure time were recorded. The test results illustrated that both unaged and aged HDPE and non carbon filled XLPE provided the higher surface <b>tracking</b> <b>resistance</b> than carbon filled XLPE, LDPE and MDPE respectively. Besides, the thermal stress aging had not much effect on the surface <b>tracking</b> <b>resistance</b> characteristic of tested material.

The prevalence of this phenotype was significantly higher (P 64 years old, and among respiratory isolates. However, > 99 % of strains had MICs of < 4 μg/ml regardless of the risk group examined, and the MIC population distributions were the same for each risk group.

40|$|Abstract-For {{restoration}} of grasp in disabled people {{by means of}} functional electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves, 18 polar Hybrid Cuff Electrodes were developed. These electrodes consisted of a micromachined polyimide-based thin-film structure with integrated electrode contacts and interconnection lines which was glued to a silicone cuff. Interconnection lines were made of only 300 nm of sputtered gold, which led to high line drops. Gold electroplating was used to thicken the lines to 3 µm, which reduced the mean <b>track</b> <b>resistance</b> from 480 W to 10 W. Furthermore, the electrode material was changed from sputtered platinum to electroplated platinum black in order to decrease the phase border impedance of stimulation sites. Applying these techniques, the overall electrode impedance could be reduced from 7. 78 kW to 624 W (at 1 kHz). Additional to the electrical optimization of the cuff electrodes, mechanical properties were enhanced by changing the method of joining silicone and polyimide from using one part silicone adhesive to plasma activation of surfaces: Plasma-treated surfaces were simply pressed face to face.

Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni (C. jejuni) and C. coli have been recognized since the late 1970 s as important agents of gastrointestinal infections throughout the world; in the United States, these infections affect approximately 1 % of the population each year (1). Contaminated food is the usual source of human infections; therefore, the presence of fluoroquinolone- and macrolide-resistant strains in the food chain has raised concerns that the treatment of human infections will be compromised.
