5|$|The Hotel Valley Ho is a {{striking}} example of the mid-century modern architectural style. Varney's use of masonry, cast and poured concrete, natural stone, and wide expanses of glass make for a close connection between the building and its environment. Stone floor and wall patterns link the exterior entry and the lobby, as does {{the extension of the}} redwood ceiling. The hotel is now considered one of the finest examples of organic architecture. Rooms in the two adjacent wings added in the late 1950s are unusual, and remarkably forward-thinking even by mid-century design standards, for their high nine-foot-ceilings. The prevailing trend at the time of original construction was low-ceilinged rooms, in some cases with ceilings only seven feet above ground level, but the Valley Ho's rooms feel exceptionally roomy and airy thanks to its original decision <b>to</b> <b>buck</b> design trends.|$|E
5|$|The {{motorcycle}} {{technology of}} the late 1970s featured engines with power in excess of what the frames and tires of the day could accommodate. Roberts' riding style, bred on the dirt tracks of America, revolutionized road racing. Prior to his arrival in Europe, riders focused on attaining high entry speeds into corners, leaving braking until the last possible moment then, carving graceful arcs through the corners with both wheels in line. Roberts did just the opposite, braking early then, quickly applying the throttle {{which resulted in the}} rear tire breaking traction and spinning. The resulting tire spin caused the motorcycle <b>to</b> <b>buck</b> and shake as it continually lost then regained traction, creating a brutal, violent riding style that no one had ever seen before on the racetracks of Europe. His riding style was reminiscent of dirt track riding, where sliding the rear tire to one side is used as a method to steer the motorcycle around a corner. Because of his early application of the throttle, he was able to attain top speed faster than his competitors.|$|E

In Bradford County, the worst of the flooding occurred in the western side of the county, especially in areas adjacent <b>to</b> <b>Buck</b> and Bentley creeks. At Wells Township, State Route 549 was washed out and flooding damaged 8 businesses and 17 homes. In Waverly, the basement of the Village Hall and annex building were both flooded, damaging village archives and police equipment. Throughout the county, about 30 roads, including U.S. Route 6 and state routes 14 and 4028, were closed because of high water or debris, while a bridge in Smithfield Township was washed out. A total of 35 people evacuated from their homes due to flooding. In Lycoming County, the Lycoming Creek crested at heights exceeding records set during Hurricane Agnes in 1972. Nearly all roads in the central and western portions of the county were shutdown due to water inundation. About 350 people evacuated or were rescued from their homes, 178 of whom took refuge at Red Cross shelters. A total of 75 homes and 80 trailers were severely damaged or destroyed.|$|E

25|$|The Confederate {{authorities}} had long {{believed that the}} Navy's ironclad ships, particularly CSS Louisiana, would render the river impregnable against assaults such as they were now experiencing. Although Louisiana was not yet finished, Generals Lovell and Duncan pressed Commodore Whittle to hurry the preparation. Acceding to their wishes against his better judgment, Whittle had the ship launched prematurely and added to Commander Mitchell's fleet even while workmen were still fitting her out. On {{the second day of}} the bombardment, she was towed (too late, her owners found that her engines were not strong enough to enable her <b>to</b> <b>buck</b> the current) to a position on the left bank, upstream from Fort St. Philip, where she became in effect a floating battery. Mitchell would not move her closer because her armor would not protect her from the plunging shot of Porter's mortars. However, because her guns could not be elevated, they could not be brought to bear on the enemy so long as they remained below the forts.|$|E
25|$|The Union fleet faced only token {{opposition}} at Chalmette, {{and thereafter}} had clear sailing to New Orleans. The fourteen vessels remaining arrived {{there in the}} afternoon of April 25 and laid the city under their guns. In the meantime, General Lovell had evacuated the troops {{that had been in}} the city, so no defense was possible. Panic-stricken citizens broke into stores, burned cotton and other supplies, and destroyed much of the waterfront. The unfinished CSS Mississippi was hastily launched; it was hoped that she could be towed to Memphis, but no towboats could be found, so she was burned by order of her captain. Farragut demanded the surrender of the city. The mayor and city council tried <b>to</b> <b>buck</b> the unpleasant duty up to Lovell, but he passed it back to them. After three days of fruitless negotiations, Farragut sent two officers ashore with a detachment of sailors and marines. They went to the Custom House, where they hauled down the state flag and ran up the United States flag. That signified the official return of the city to the Union.|$|E
25|$|When the Blonds' time in Los Angeles ended {{near the}} end of 1975, they {{returned}} to the Tri State promotion and immediately targeted the United States Tag Team championship. On March 18, 1976, the duo defeated Greg Valentine and Gorgeous George, Jr. Due to disputes over pay and billing the Blonds’ time in Tri State was short lived, they quickly dropped the tag team title <b>to</b> <b>Buck</b> Robley and Bob Slaughter only eleven days after they won them. The Blonds next appeared in CWF once more, winning the Florida Tag Team titles from Steve Keirn and Bob Backlund not long after arriving in the territory. Just like with Tri State, their stay in Florida was short, as they dropped the titles to Mike Graham and Ken Lucas only a few months later and left. After a short stay in Florida, the duo began working for Jim Crockett’s Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (MACW). On January 17, 1977, Roberts and Brown defeated the team of Dino Bravo and Tim Woods for the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship and held on to it for three months until Bravo and new partner Tiger Conway Jr. beat them for the gold. During the summer of 1977, the Hollywood Blonds moved from Mid-Atlantic to Memphis and the NWA Mid-America promotion (later Continental Wrestling Association, CWA). In Memphis, the Blonds shot up the tag team ranks right off the bat defeating Bob Ellis and Jim Garvin for the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship on July 25. The Blonds lost the titkes to Norvell Austin and Pat Barrett on August 15. After holding the titles two more times, the team lost them for good to Austin and Barrett on September 25, 1977.|$|E

Extravasation of urine involving a compromised Buck's fascia can be appreciated clinically by blood collecting in the superficial pouch, resulting in a 'butterfly'-shaped region around the penis.|$|R

Gray said that Shikasta is closer to Gulliver's Travels and the Old Testament than it is <b>to</b> <b>Buck</b> Rogers, and may disappoint readers interpreting her [...] "space fiction" [...] as [...] "science fiction". He found Lessing's bleak vision of Earth's history in which she suggests that humans [...] "could not... help making the messes they have, that their blunders were all ordained by a small tic in the cosmos", a little [...] "unsatisfying", but added {{that even if you}} do not subscribe to her theories, the book can still be enjoyable, [...] "even furiously engaging on every page".

The album dealt with themes of loss and mourning inspired by [...] "that sense of... turning thirty", according <b>to</b> <b>Buck.</b> Several songs featured string arrangements by former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones.

The album would sell over fifteen million copies worldwide. As with Out of Time, there was no tour in support of the album.

500|$|In another {{unqualified}} review, Time {{wrote that}} the film had [...] "a vitality that makes their efforts fully the equal of the original picture...

[...] The Oakland Tribune concurred it was [...] "a fantasy produced on a rather magnificent scale, with excellent stagecraft and fine photographic effects". While the Winnipeg Free Press thought that the electrical equipment {{might have been better}} suited <b>to</b> <b>Buck</b> Rogers, nonetheless the reviewer praised the film as [...] "exciting and sometimes morbidly gruesome", declaring that [...] "All who enjoyed Frankenstein will welcome his Bride as a worthy successor."

500|$|Eager {{to explore}} the music video medium, Stipe secured funding for a short film that would {{accompany}} music from {{the first half of}} Reckoning. Stipe's concept was to film the project at folk artist R.A. Miller's Whirlgig Farm, and he recruited Athens filmmaker James Herbert to direct it. In March 1984 R.E.M. filmed Left of Reckoning at the Whirlgig Farm in Rabbittown, Georgia.

In contrast to standard music video imagery, the film consists primarily of footage of the band members wandering around the farm, while Herbert utilizes close-ups, silhouettes, and slow motion footage. Herbert utilized rephotography during the editing process, which involved taking photographs of film frames at random, while also closing in or pulling back from the image with no regard to narrative.
