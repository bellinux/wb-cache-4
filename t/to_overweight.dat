2500|$|Preventing {{obesity and}} {{overweight}} conditions presents a significant opportunity to reduce costs. The Centers for Disease Control reported that approximately 9% of healthcare costs in 1998 were attributable <b>to</b> <b>overweight</b> and obesity, or {{as much as}} $93 billion in 2002 dollars. Nearly half of these costs were {{paid for by the}} government via Medicare or Medicaid. However, by 2008 the CDC estimated these costs had nearly doubled to $147 billion. The CDC identified a series of expensive conditions more likely to occur due to obesity. The CDC released a series of strategies to prevent obesity and overweight, including: making healthy foods and beverages more available; supporting healthy food choices; encouraging kids to be more active; and creating safe communities to support physical activity. An estimated 26% of U.S. adults in 2007 were obese, versus 24% in 2005. State obesity rates ranged from 18% to 30%. Obesity rates were roughly equal among men and women. Some have proposed a so-called [...] "fat tax" [...] to provide incentives for healthier behavior, either by levying the tax on products (such as soft drinks) that are thought to contribute to obesity, or to individuals based on body measures, as is done in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|P-40N (manufactured 1943–44), {{the final}} {{production}} model. The P-40N featured a stretched rear fuselage {{to counter the}} torque of the larger, late-war Allison engine, and the rear deck of the cockpit behind the pilot was cut down at a moderate slant to improve rearward visibility. A great deal of work was also done to try and eliminate excess weight to improve the Warhawk's climb rate. Early N production blocks dropped a [...]50in (12.7mm) gun from each wing, bringing the total back to four; later production blocks reintroduced it after complaints from units in the field. Supplied to Commonwealth air forces as the Kittyhawk Mk IV. A total of 553 P-40Ns were acquired by the Royal Australian Air Force, making it the variant most commonly used by the RAAF. Subvariants of the P-40N ranged widely in specialization from stripped down four-gun [...] "hot rods" [...] that could reach the highest top speeds of any production variant of the P-40 (up to 380mph), <b>to</b> <b>overweight</b> types with all the extras intended for fighter-bombing or even training missions. The 15,000th P-40 was an N model decorated with the markings of 28 nations that had employed any of Curtiss-Wright's various aircraft products, not just P-40s. [...] "These spectacular markings {{gave rise to the}} erroneous belief that the P-40 series had been used by all 28 countries." [...] Since the P-40N was by 1944 used mainly as a ground attack aircraft in Europe, it was nicknamed B-40 by pilots. [...] Survivors redesignated as ZF-40N in June 1948.|$|E

40|$|Overweight {{and obesity}} in {{children}} is an extensive and accelerating {{problem in the}} western world. The risk factors for overweight are well- known and well-documented. Focus should lie in the prophylactic work in order <b>to</b> prevent <b>overweight</b> and obesity in preschool children. The aim of our study has been to highlight {{the role of the}} district nurse in her/his work <b>to</b> prevent <b>overweight</b> and obesity in preschool children. The study was carried out through studies as a literature review. In order to support the parents and taking their circumstances and conditions into consideration, it was considered very important that the district nurse paid attention to the view of the parents on the weight of their child. Parents were considered to have an important role in giving their children healthy eating habits. The attitude of the district nurse was relevant as to how she/he treated the overweight and how she/he tackled the preventive work. Professional practice and training within the field were important factors in making the district nurse succeed in her/his work <b>to</b> prevent <b>overweight</b> and obesity in children. Lack of time and lack of parental commitment and attitude were the main reasons for limiting the district nurse in her work <b>to</b> prevent <b>overweight</b> and obesity in children. Personnel within the primary care should supervise and coordinate health promoting measures in order <b>to</b> prevent <b>overweight</b> and obesity in children. The district nurse plays a unique part in influencing the parents very early on in their children’s life by arranging regular and repeated visits to the child welfare center. The basis for a successful work by the district nurse is training {{and the fact that she}} is made aware of her own attitudes towards overweight. More research is imperative to support and develop guidelines for preventing overweight and obesity in children...|$|R
40|$|Background: Adolescent {{need special}} {{attention}} {{due to their}} physical and psychosocial development. Studies about nutritional status of adolescent girls have been least explored in Indonesia. Objective: <b>to</b> assess <b>overweight</b> adolescence girls related to their socio-demographic condition. Methods: the data {{was part of the}} Basic Health Research 2010, which wasa cross sectional and non intervention study. It covered 33 provinces, 441 districts/municipalities, and 70, 000 households. The sampling was based on economical status and urban/rural ratio. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from weight and height measured from all participants. The author analyzed 21, 799 non pregnant girls aged 10 - 19 years by calculating Crude odds ratio and Adjusted odds ratio between overweight and normal weight and their socio demographic variables. Results: 45. 3 % underweight (BMI < 18. 5), 44. 0 % normal weight (BMI 18. 5 - 22. 9), 5. 7 % overweight- 1 (BMI 23. 0 - 24. 9), 4. 0 % overweight- 2 (25. 0 - 29. 9) and 1. 1 % obese (BMI ~ 30). Those who were married were 1. 87 fold more likely <b>to</b> be <b>overweight</b> (95 % Cl: 1. 48 - 2. 36), those who lived at urban area were 1. 26 fold more likely <b>to</b> be <b>overweight</b> (95 % Cl: 1. 09 - 1. 45). In adjusted models, those aged 10 - 12 years were 1. 48 fold more likely <b>to</b> be <b>overweight</b> (95 % Cl: 1. 25 - 1. 76) and those with the highest quintile was 1. 82 fold more likely <b>to</b> be <b>overweight</b> (95 % Cl: 1. 47 - 2. 24). Conclusion: The high levels of overweight among adolescent girls were a public health concern. A higher prevalence of overweight was mainly found in married adolescent, those who lived in urban area, the younger ones and those with higher socioeconomic strata. It needs a comprehensive adolescent health programs...|$|R
