5|$|Principal {{photography}} ended {{three days}} before Christmas 1977, on the Choctawhatchee Bay, near Destin, Florida. The actors had to put ice cubes in their mouths to prevent <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> showing on camera. The final sequence to be filmed was the shark being electrocuted on the cable. In mid-January, the crew reconvened in Hollywood {{with some of the}} teenage actors for five weeks of post-production photography.|$|E
5|$|The {{coconut crab}} is {{terrestrial}} and uses structures called branchiostegal lungs to breathe air. They cannot swim and would drown in water, yet they possess a rudimentary set of gills. They can breathe {{on land and}} hold <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> underwater. The branchiostegal lungs {{are seen as a}} developmental adaptive stage from water-living to enable land-living, or from fish to amphibian.|$|E
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} (collapsed lung) is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall. The lung cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. An easy to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. Similarly, a scuba diver ascending while holding <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> with their lungs fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural space.|$|E

5|$|To avoid injury during descent, divers must be {{competent}} at equalising the ears, sinuses and mask; {{they must}} also learn not to hold <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> while ascending, to avoid barotrauma of the lungs. The speed of ascent must be controlled to avoid DCS, which requires buoyancy control skills. Good buoyancy control and trim also allow the diver to manoeuvre and move about safely, comfortably and efficiently, using swimfins for propulsion.|$|E
5|$|In Garden Rain (1974, for brass ensemble), {{the limited}} and pitch-specific {{harmonic}} vocabulary of the Japanese mouth organ, the shō (see ex. 3), and its specific timbres, are clearly emulated in Takemitsu's writing for brass instruments; even similarities of performance practice can be seen, (the players are often required to hold notes {{to the limit}} of <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> capacity). In A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden, the characteristic timbres of the shō and its chords (several of which are simultaneous soundings of traditional Japanese pentatonic scales) are emulated in the opening held chords of the wind instruments (the first chord is in fact an exact transposition of the shō's chord, Jū (i); see ex. 3); meanwhile a solo oboe is assigned a melodic line that is similarly reminiscent of the lines played by the hichiriki in gagaku ensembles.|$|E
5|$|A {{cancerous}} patient, Marina Wagner (Amanda Collins), {{is admitted}} {{into the hospital}} and is revealed to have toxic blood - presumably caused by a chemical reaction between an herbal supplement and chemotherapy - making several physicians fall ill. O'Malley is exposed to the neurotoxin, and quickly becomes anxious, fearing that his marriage is the cause of the sickness. Ellis is diagnosed with a heart condition, in which surgery or medication are options. Ellis does not want the surgery, but Meredith fears that she will not be compliant with her medication. Shepherd and Burke try to close up Wagner as the OR was evacuated before her surgery was completed, by entering the operating room with sealed, airtight suits. Ellis agrees to the surgery, but opts to speak with Webber, her former lover. A teenage patient is brought into the clinic by her father, hoping that a doctor can teach her how to use tampons. When her father leaves the room, she explains to Bailey that she had sex, but her pregnancy test is negative. Shepherd and Burke run out of air whilst operating on Wagner, so Yang, Stevens, and Meredith enter holding <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> to close the patient's incision. O'Malley's colleagues act in a rude manner to his new marriage, and displeased, he lectures them, standing up for Torres. Sloan is seen to be having sex with Montgomery, and Yang agrees to marry Burke. At the conclusion of the episode, Ellis' lucidity has vanished, leaving Meredith and Webber distraught.|$|E
60|$|They cut away, and the Rose, {{released}} from the strain, shook her feathers on the wave-crest like a freed sea-gull, while all men held <b>their</b> <b>breaths.</b>|$|R

5|$|Minority Report also {{continues}} Spielberg's {{tradition of}} depicting broken families.*Vest. pg. 136 In Dick's short story, Anderton is a childless, married man whose main motives are self-preservation and preventing the disassembly of the PreCrime division. While {{he is also}} trying to save himself in the movie, his greater concern is uncovering the story behind his son's disappearance. Spielberg would later transform his next science fiction film, War of the Worlds, from a story about a single man to one about a divorced father concerned with protecting his children. Buckland notes that the two tragic parent-child relationships in the picture (Agatha and Ann Lively, John and Sean Anderton) have a common element. The movie has four shots of them submerged in water. Agatha's face is shown in a close up shot, taken from directly above her, when she is submerged in her photon milk, nutrient bath. When photos of her mother's submerged corpse are shown to her, the emphasized photograph is a similar image of her face taken from directly above. Anderton and his son are shown together in a pool flashback scene in which they have a contest to see who can hold <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> longest. John is underwater when his son is taken, and later in the apartment he is shown lying motionless, immersed in a filled bathtub, in a manner Buckland finds similar to the shots of Agatha and Ann. Buckland notes that co-screenwriter Frank introduced the water theme, as he wrote Agatha and her mother's back stories while adding the bathtub scene.|$|E
25|$|Equalisation of {{pressure}} in gas spaces to avoid barotraumas. The expansion or compression of enclosed air spaces may cause discomfort or injury while diving. Critically, the lungs {{are susceptible to}} over-expansion and subsequent collapse if a diver holds <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> while ascending: during training divers are taught to never hold <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> while diving. Ear clearing is another critical equalisation procedure, usually requiring conscious intervention by the diver.|$|E

25|$|Freediving, free-diving, free diving, breath-hold diving, or {{skin diving}} {{is a form}} of {{underwater}} diving that relies on divers' ability to hold <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> until resurfacing rather than on the use of a breathing apparatus such as scuba gear.|$|E

25|$|In the United States {{there is}} the Infant Swimming Resource (ISR) {{initiative}} that provides lessons for infant children, to cope with an emergency where they have fallen into water.

25|$|Deep {{inspiration}} breath-hold (DIBH) is {{a method}} of delivering radiotherapy while limiting radiation exposure to the heart and lungs. It is used primarily for treating left-sided breast cancer. The technique involves a patient holding <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> during treatment. There are two basic methods of performing DIBH: free-breathing breath-hold and spirometry-monitored deep inspiration breath hold.|$|E
25|$|Earless seals sleep bihemispherically {{like most}} mammals, under water, hanging {{at the water}} surface or on land. They hold <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> while {{sleeping}} under water, and wake up regularly to surface and breathe. They can also hang with their nostrils above water and in that position have REM sleep, {{but they do not}} have REM sleep underwater.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the flags}} fell, men held <b>their</b> <b>breaths</b> in suspense. Few knew the victor, so close {{had been the}} struggle. But a {{flourish}} of the trumpets soon commanded attention, and then a herald proclaimed that-- ...|$|R
60|$|Jim {{the horse}} had seen these spires, also, and his ears stood {{straight}} up with fear, while Dorothy and Zeb held <b>their</b> <b>breaths</b> in suspense. But no; they floated gently down upon a broad, flat roof, {{and came to}} a stop at last.|$|R
60|$|They held <b>their</b> <b>breaths</b> {{and watched}} his face. Kenneth flushed red {{as he held}} the {{receiver}} to his ear, and then grew white. He turned around to the expectant group and Beth knew from the sparkle in his eyes what had happened.|$|R
25|$|Equalizing of {{the ears}} and mask {{are part of}} the {{essential}} skills for any form of diving, and equalizing of the airways is necessary for any form of diving where the diver breathes under pressure. This is provided for by breathing normally, and is the reason why divers are advised not to hold <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> while changing depth.|$|E
25|$|The Big Day Out has been, {{and will}} always be, the festival in Australia.

Big Day Out set the high benchmark which {{is not going to}} be succeeded by a one-day festival in the near future for sure.|$|E
25|$|Myoglobin is {{the primary}} oxygen-carrying pigment of muscle tissues. High {{concentrations}} of myoglobin in muscle cells allow organisms to hold <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> {{for a longer period}} of time. Diving mammals such as whales and seals have muscles with particularly high abundance of myoglobin. Myoglobin is found in Type I muscle, Type II A and Type II B, but most texts consider myoglobin not to be found in smooth muscle.|$|E
