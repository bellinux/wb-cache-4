5000|$|Excessive {{negative}} air pressure, {{behind a}} [...] "slug" [...] {{of water that}} is draining, can siphon water from traps at plumbing fixtures. Generally, a <b>toilet</b> <b>outlet</b> has the shortest trap seal, making it most vulnerable to being emptied by induced siphonage. An empty trap can allow noxious sewer gases to enter a building.|$|E
5000|$|The {{remains of}} the [...] "Psychiatric Ward" [...] are located further up the slope. This is a cross-shaped ward. The north-south arm has a similar pattern of partitions, drains and <b>toilet</b> <b>outlets</b> {{to that of the}} Dysentery Ward. There are two simple wings to the east and west. Located close {{to the end of the}} western wing are the remains of a brick {{incinerator}} which has been relocated to this site. There is a sewerage inspection point on the north-east corner.|$|R
5000|$|Further south, {{remains of}} the [...] "Dysentery Ward" [...] include an {{elevated}} concrete slab with evidence of several walls and partitions. There are holes for drains and <b>toilet</b> <b>outlets.</b> There is a walkway leading down to the dysentery annexe (possible ablutions block). Marks in the concrete indicate that pans {{may have been used}} to supplement the toilets. There is a wing for beds running to the west and opposite that wing, to the east, there is another section of concrete floor that may have been another wing. The remains of garden beds are evident {{on either side of the}} western wing. There is a light glass, fibro and ceramic scatter surrounding the slab. At the northern corner is a sewerage inspection point. To the west-south-west is another, roughly in line with the end of the ward wing.|$|R

50|$|Capacity: ? (standing)The West Stand {{is mostly}} {{uncovered}} terracing and {{is where the}} TV gantry and dugout is. It mostly houses away fans and has <b>toilets</b> and food <b>outlets.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The EPF has {{a greater}} level of comfort for the crew than larger Navy ships. The stateroom-style {{berthing}} areas for the ship's crew have private features like <b>toilet</b> stalls, <b>outlets,</b> air conditioning, and even thermostats. The {{same can not be}} said for the passengers, who may be subjected to [...] "hot racking"-style living arrangements of available berthing bunks if necessary. There is no gym on board, nor soda machines or candy machines. There is no ship's store in the typical Navy sense of the term, but rather the ship's captain may unlock and sell ship's coins and other ship-specific paraphernalia on a case-by-case basis.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} fully staffed {{seven days a}} week, with the ticket office open from 06:30 (Mon-Sat)/10:15 Sundays until 23:30.

5000|$|... 28 May 2016, {{funding for}} stage {{two of the}} {{redevelopment}} of Narrabundah Ballpark was announced by ACT Labor. $4.5 million would be spent from the 2016-17 budget on the upgrade. Upgrades will include improvements to amenities such as change rooms, <b>toilets</b> and food <b>outlets,</b> extension to the grand stand that will replace the bleacher seating, additional seating {{at the front of}} the grandstand at below ground level to provide a unique viewing experience, similar to some MLB venues in the US and enhancements to address parking and traffic at the facility.|$|R
2500|$|The {{redevelopment}} project {{included a}} three-tier South stand replacing the old South and [...] West stands, with {{a capacity of}} 24,000, and a three-tier East replacing the Terraces. The number of covered seats increased from 23,000 to 38,000. The redeveloped Eden Park has an internal concourse that allows people to circulate around the grounds inside the stadium, and world-class facilities, including food and beverage <b>outlets,</b> <b>toilets</b> and corporate areas, were incorporated. The open plan approach to the design and establishment of a community centre and green space, {{and the removal of}} the perimeter fence, mean that the stadium has become more publicly accessible and a part of the neighbourhood.|$|R
25|$|The Fairfield Street entrance, at {{basement}} level, {{serves the}} car park, the taxi rank, and the Metrolink station. Above it at track level is a concourse {{into which the}} main entrance feeds, housing ticket offices, information points, seating, timetables, toilets, shops, and food and drink outlets. Above the concourse is a second level of food outlets and bars, and the Virgin Trains First Class Lounge. On the main concourse, glass doors within a large glass partition lead to platforms 1 to 12. A travelator leads to the upper concourse linked by a footbridge, steps and lift to platforms 13 and 14. The island lounge contains retail <b>outlets,</b> <b>toilets</b> and a departure lounge. There are vending machines, waiting areas and snack bars on platforms 13 and 14.|$|R
