40|$|Zakah {{is a very}} basal {{religious}} service and closely interconnected with both transcen-dental and social aspects of human life. According to Islamic rules, zakah is imposed on every soul (zakah al-fitr) and certain properties meeting the standardized measure (zakah al-maal). Collected zakah is hereinafter distributed to the poor, the needy, the people em-ployed to administer zakah, and the people whose hearts are made to embrace Islam, the people in bondage, the people twined by debt, the fighters {{in the cause of}} Allah, as well as the wayfarers. In Zakah Management Act No. 38 / 1999 mentioned, that zakah which have been bestowed to Badan Amil Zakah or Lembaga Amil Zakah (i. e. government and non-government bodies for the collection of zakah respectively) will be considered as deducti-ble for one 2 ̆ 7 s <b>taxable</b> profits or <b>incomes.</b> Likewise, in Act No. 17 / 2000 contended that zakah of income can be considered as deductible for one 2 ̆ 7 s <b>taxable</b> <b>incomes.</b> With a few appropri-ate assumptions, we can prove that the application of zakah as deductible for one 2 ̆ 7 s <b>taxable</b> <b>incomes</b> will have several impacts on the economy. Aggregate consumption will increase, saving will decrease, investment criterion will change, and national income as a whole will finally enlarge. Government is therefore suggested not to hesitate to execute the Zakah Consciousness Movement...|$|R
