5|$|A rising China {{has been}} {{increasingly}} interested in Central Asia and the Eurasian Economic Union. Analysts see the union {{as a potential}} way China could facilitate its investments in the region. Historically, China held close economic ties with many countries throughout Eurasia. Under the Han Dynasty, its <b>trade</b> <b>routes</b> extended to the Roman Empire. The Economy of the Han Dynasty and other subsequent dynasties exchanged numerous goods with countries throughout Europe and Asia. Both China and the union have stated they would benefit from recreating <b>trade</b> <b>routes</b> modelled on the historic Silk Road.|$|E

5|$|From Yemen, as from Egypt, the Ayyubids {{aimed to}} {{dominate}} the Red Sea <b>trade</b> <b>routes</b> which Egypt depended on and so sought to tighten their grip over the Hejaz, where an important trade stop, Yanbu, was located. To favor trade {{in the direction of}} the Red Sea, the Ayyubids built facilities along the Red Sea-Indian Ocean <b>trade</b> <b>routes</b> to accompany merchants. The Ayyubids also aspired to back their claims of legitimacy within the Caliphate by having sovereignty over the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. The conquests and economic advancements undertaken by Saladin effectively established Egypt's hegemony in the region.|$|E

50|$|In the Middle Ages, the Volga <b>trade</b> <b>route</b> {{connected}} Northern Europe and Northwestern Russia {{with the}} Caspian Sea, via the Volga River. The Rus used this <b>route</b> to <b>trade</b> with Muslim {{countries on the}} southern shores of the Caspian Sea, sometimes penetrating as far as Baghdad. The route functioned concurrently with the Dnieper <b>trade</b> <b>route,</b> {{better known as the}} <b>trade</b> <b>route</b> from the Varangians to the Greeks, and lost its importance in the 11th century.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-9th century, the Volkhov was {{a heavily}} {{populated}} trade artery of the Varangian-dominated Rus' Khaganate. It was {{a vital part}} of the most important <b>trade</b> <b>route</b> connecting Northern Europe to the Orient, by way of the Volga (Volga <b>trade</b> <b>route)</b> and Dnieper (<b>trade</b> <b>route</b> from the Varangians to the Greeks). The ancient Russian capital Staraya Ladoga and one of the most significant Russian medieval cities Velikiy Novgorod are located along the Volkhov.|$|R

5|$|Mongolia's central {{geographical}} {{position on}} the Asian continent was an important reason why {{it was able to}} play such a large role in the trade system. The Mongol army was easily able to assert strong rule throughout most of the empire. The military ensured that supply lines and <b>trade</b> <b>routes</b> flowed smoothly; permanent garrisons were established along <b>trade</b> <b>routes</b> to protect the travellers on these routes. Complex local systems of taxation and extortion that were prevalent before Mongol rule were abolished to ensure the smooth flow of merchants and trade through the empire. A system of weights-and-measures was also standardised. To make the voyage on the <b>trade</b> <b>routes</b> less harrowing, the Mongols went as far as to plant trees along the roads to shade the merchants and travellers in the summer months; stone pillars were used to mark the roads where trees could not grow.|$|E
5|$|The Parisii, a sub-tribe of the Celtic Senones, {{inhabited}} the Paris area {{from around the}} middle of the 3rd century BC. One of the area's major north-south <b>trade</b> <b>routes</b> crossed the Seine on the île de la Cité; this meeting place of land and water <b>trade</b> <b>routes</b> gradually became a town and an important trading centre. The Parisii traded with many river towns as far away as the Iberian Peninsula, and minted their own coins for that purpose.|$|E

5|$|<b>Trade</b> <b>routes</b> {{not only}} {{supplied}} physical goods, they facilitated {{the movement of}} people and ideas throughout Mesoamerica. Shifts in <b>trade</b> <b>routes</b> occurred with {{the rise and fall}} of important cities in the Maya region, and have been identified in every major reorganization of the Maya civilization, such as the rise of Preclassic Maya civilization, the transition to the Classic, and the Terminal Classic collapse. Even the Spanish Conquest did not immediately terminate all Maya trading activity; for example, the Contact period Manche Ch'ol traded the prestige crops of cacao, annatto and vanilla into colonial Verapaz.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 5th century AD, {{new land}} routes between Asia and Europe {{developed}} {{further to the}} north, in the Rus'. Many of these routes passed through Yugra and extended to the Baltic region. The Khazars, Volga Bulgaria, and the Rus' Khaganate were active in trading along the northern <b>trade</b> <b>routes.</b>|$|E

25|$|It {{seems that}} the Scandinavians made some use of the Dvina <b>trade</b> <b>route,</b> in {{addition}} to the Volga <b>trade</b> <b>route</b> and Dnieper <b>trade</b> <b>route.</b> In 1217, two Norwegian traders arrived in Bjarmaland to buy pelts; one of the traders continued further south to pass to Russia in order to arrive in the Holy Land, where he intended {{to take part in the}} Crusades. The second trader who remained was, however, killed by the Bjarmians. This caused Norwegian officials to undertake a campaign of retribution into Bjarmaland which they pillaged in 1222.|$|R

5|$|Maritime trade {{began with}} safer coastal trade and evolved with the {{manipulation}} of the monsoon winds, soon resulting in trade crossing boundaries such as the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. South Asia had multiple maritime <b>trade</b> <b>routes</b> which connected it to Southeast Asia, thereby making the control of one route resulting in maritime monopoly difficult. Indian connections to various Southeast Asian states buffered it from blockages on other routes. By making use of the maritime <b>trade</b> <b>routes,</b> bulk commodity trade became possible for the Romans in the 2nd century BCE. A Roman trading vessel could span the Mediterranean in a month at one-sixtieth the cost of over-land routes.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with land}} <b>trade</b> <b>routes,</b> a Maritime Silk Road {{contributed to the}} flow of goods and {{establishment}} of a Pax Mongolica. This Maritime Silk Road started with short coastal routes in Southern China. As technology and navigation progressed these routes developed into a high-seas route into the Indian Ocean. Eventually these routes further developed encompassing the Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and the sea off East Africa.|$|E
