5|$|The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (also {{known as}} Artsakh among Armenians) remains internationally unrecognized. Today, <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> and Nagorno-Karabakh Republic are de facto {{functioning}} as one entity, although the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic territory is internationally recognized as de jure part of Azerbaijan. Nagorno-Karabakh is more monoethnic than <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia,</b> with 99.7% {{of its population}} being Armenian. The Azerbaijani minority {{was forced to leave}} during the war. The areas outside the original NKAO borders taken over by the Armenian forces during the war are mostly uninhabited or very sparsely inhabited, with the city of Lachin being exception. Between 2000 and 2011, 25,000 to 30,000 people settled in NKR.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{recognition of}} the Armenian Genocide by the US federal government is seen {{one of the most}} vital steps in international and full {{recognition of the}} 1915–1923 events. Many Armenians think that the US has the ability to force Turkey to recognize the past and pay Armenians and Armenia their reparations, that includes (for some) the return of the so-called Wilsonian Armenia to <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Christophor Avvakumyan Vermishyan(ts) (Քրիստոփոր Վերմիշև January 1863 in Baku - 1932) was an Armenian {{politician}} {{who served as}} Minister of Social Protection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> from 1918 to 1919 and as Minister of Provisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> in 1919 ...|$|R
5|$|Immediately {{before and}} {{continuing}} into {{the time of}} the dissolution of the Soviet Union, waves of Armenians from <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> and other former Soviet republics arrived for political reasons and economic opportunities, settling in older established Armenian communities across the country. The 1988 Armenian earthquake and the energy crisis in Armenia during the Nagorno-Karabakh War caused an estimated number of 700,000 Armenians to leave the country, most of whom ended up in Russia, still others in the US, and some in Europe. Annually, on average 2,000 people from Armenia migrated to the US since 1994, not including ethnic Armenians from Middle Eastern countries. According to the 2000 US Census, there were 65,280 Armenian-born people in the US: 57,482 in California, 1,981 in New York and 1,155 in Massachusetts. According to the 2011 American Community Survey, there were 85,150 Armenian-born people in the US, about 20,000 more than in 2000. According to the US embassy in Yerevan, about 21,000 citizens of <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> have moved to the US for permanent residency in the period from 1995 to 2012. Meanwhile, Armenian immigration from the Middle East continues, contributing to California's distinction of having, by far, the highest Armenian American population of any state.|$|E
5|$|The Armenian National Council {{declared}} {{the independence of}} the Armenian provinces on 28 May 1918. It was recognized by the Ottoman Empire by the Treaty of Batum on 4 June 1918. After its defeat in World War I, the Ottoman Empire and the Allies signed the Armistice of Mudros by which the Turkish troops left the Caucasus and by 1919 <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> established control over the former Kars Oblast, the city of Iğdır and its surrounding territory, including Mount Ararat.|$|E
5|$|In late May 1988, amid rising {{nationalist}} tensions from glasnost and perestroika, Armenia's new Communist {{party leader}} allowed the banned tricolour of the DRA {{to fly in}} Yerevan {{for the first time}} in over sixty years. A year later, following a Nagorno-Karabakh-themed mass demonstration where the tricolour was flown, he urged its official recognition. This came on August 24, 1990, a day after the Armenian Supreme Soviet declared the republic's sovereignty and renamed the country <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia.</b> At that point, just over a year before Armenia declared its formal independence from the USSR, the tricolour replaced the 1952 flag.|$|E
50|$|The {{office of}} Prime Minister was first {{established}} in 1918 with the foundation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia.</b> It vanished when <b>the</b> First <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> {{was incorporated into}} the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic.

5|$|The Armenian {{language}} has two distinct standardized forms: Western Armenian and Eastern Armenian, both widely spoken among the Armenian American community. Armenians from Lebanon, Turkey, Syria and few other countries speak the Western dialect, which was spoken in Turkish (Western) Armenia, the eastern regions of Turkey with historical Armenian presence. Eastern Armenian is primarily spoken in <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> and Iran, though the Iranian Armenians {{have their own}} dialect. Furthermore, Western and Eastern Armenian use two different spellings. In Armenia, the reformed orthography is used, while most Armenians in the diaspora (including Lebanon, Syria, Turkey and Iran) use the classical orthography.|$|E
5|$|The {{three major}} Armenian {{political}} {{parties of the}} late 19th century and early 20th century — the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutyun), Social Democrat Hunchakian Party (Hunchak) and Armenakan Party (later Ramgavar) were present in America not too long after their foundation. They established their own newspapers: Hairenik and Asbarez by Dashnaks and Baikar by Ramgavars. After the Bolsheviks took over Armenia in 1920, Rmagavars and Hunchaks formed a coalition supporting Soviet Armenia, while the ARF, the ruling party of <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> from 1918 to 1920, remained anti-Soviet in the diaspora. The 1988 Spitak earthquake and the Karabakh movement brought the separate groups of the Armenian community together.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Soviet Union, the Armenian SSR {{transformed}} from a largely agricultural hinterland to an important industrial production center, while its population almost quadrupled from around 880,000 in 1926 to 3.3 million in 1989 due to natural growth and large-scale influx of Armenian Genocide survivors and their descendants. On August 23, 1990, it was renamed <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> after its sovereignty was declared, but remained in the Soviet Union until its official proclamation of independence on 21 September 1991. Its independence was recognized on 26 December 1991 when the Soviet Union ceased to exist. After {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union, the state of the post-Union Republic of Armenia existed until the adoption of the new constitution in 1995.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} stages of World War I, Andranik {{commanded}} the first Armenian volunteer battalion within the Russian Imperial army against the Ottoman Empire, capturing and later governing much of the traditional Armenian homeland. After the Revolution of 1917, the Russian army retreated and left the Armenian irregulars outnumbered against the Turks. Andranik led the defense of Erzurum in early 1918, but was forced to retreat eastward. By May 1918, Turkish forces stood near Yerevanthe future Armenian capitaland were halted at the Battle of Sardarabad. The Dashnak-dominated Armenian National Council declared the independence of Armenia and signed the Treaty of Batum with the Ottoman Empire, by which Armenia gave up its rights to Western Armenia. Andranik never accepted the existence of the First Republic of Armenia because it included {{only a small part of}} the area many Armenians hoped to make independent. Andranik, independently from <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia,</b> fought in Zangezur against the Azerbaijani and Turkish armies and helped to keep it within Armenia.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{two years}} after <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> was established, on 23 April 1920, the United States officially {{recognized}} it. Its frontiers were to be determined later. On 26 April 1920, the Supreme Council of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers in Paris (British Prime Minister Lloyd George, French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau and Italian Prime Minister Francesco Saverio Nitti) requested that the United States accept the mandate over Armenia and to make an Arbitral Decision to determine the boundaries of Armenia with Turkey. President Woodrow Wilson agreed to act as arbitrator and draw a mutually acceptable border between the two nations. In July 1920, the US State Department founded the Committee upon the Arbitration of the Boundary between Turkey and Armenia, headed by William Westermann. The Treaty of Sèvres was signed on 10 August 1920. On 28 September 1920, the Committee submitted a report that defined the border between Armenia and Turkey. It guaranteed access to the Mediterranean sea for Armenia via Trebizond and proclaimed Turkey's border regions demilitarization frontier line.|$|E
