5|$|The {{species in}} all {{probability}} {{has little or no}} direct impact or influence on human interests and concerns but agricultural and real estate development are a threat to the species' very narrow habitat. Collecting specimens in the dry ridges is complicated by the millions of ants which eat the bait in <b>the</b> <b>trap</b> the moment it is set on the ground. Live collecting is the alternative, but the bait is usually digested by the time the animal is taken from <b>the</b> <b>trap,</b> making food research difficult if not impossible.|$|E

40|$|In {{an optical}} {{tweezers}} system, the force measurement with a resolution less than pico-Newton {{can be achieved}} by precise measurement and analysis of <b>the</b> <b>trapped</b> particle trajectory. Typically, this single particle tracking technique is realized by a quadrant position sensor which detects the scattering lights of <b>the</b> <b>trapping</b> laser beam from <b>the</b> <b>trapped</b> particle. However, as the radius of <b>the</b> <b>trapped</b> particle is larger than the wavelength of <b>the</b> <b>trapped</b> laser, <b>the</b> scattering pattern becomes complicated, and it limits the tracking region and the signal sensitivity on <b>the</b> <b>trapped</b> particle. To solve this issue, an extra probing laser with optimized focal offset according to <b>the</b> <b>trapping</b> laser is applied to improve the flexibility and performance of our particle tracking system for each particle size. A rule of thumb between the optimized focal offsets and particle size is also concluded from the experimental results and theoretical simulations...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} model for investigating {{the effect of}} <b>the</b> <b>trapped</b> energetic particles (EPs) on the resistive wall mode (RWM) instability is proposed. The results demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>trapped</b> EPs have a dramatic stabilizing effect on the RWM because of resonant interaction between the mode and the magnetic precession drift motion of <b>the</b> <b>trapped</b> EPs. <b>The</b> results also show {{that the effect of}} <b>the</b> <b>trapped</b> EPs depends on the wall position. In addition, the stabilizing effect becomes stronger when the plasma rotation is taken into account. For sufficiently fast plasma rotation, <b>the</b> <b>trapped</b> EPs can lead to the complete stabilization of the RWM. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>trapped</b> EPs can induce a finite real frequency of the RWM in the absence of plasma rotation...|$|R
5|$|When {{someone is}} {{within range of}} a trap, a sensor bar will move into a red zone. Activating <b>the</b> <b>trap</b> at this moment will capture them. If <b>the</b> <b>trap</b> is {{activated}} when the bar {{is not in the}} red zone, <b>the</b> <b>trap</b> will not work and will become disabled {{for a short period of}} time. The traps will also only work if the access code is correct. There are six possible access codes, and the player must eavesdrop into the conversations to find out when the Martins change the code. When a new code is learned, the player must wait until the speaker leaves the room before changing the access code to the correct color to maintain control of the traps. Counters on the screen indicate how many perpetrators have entered the house and how many have been captured.|$|E
5|$|A protocarnivorous plant (sometimes also paracarnivorous, subcarnivorous, or {{borderline}} carnivore), {{according to}} some definitions, traps and kills insects or other animals but lacks the ability to either directly digest or absorb nutrients from its prey like a carnivorous plant. The morphological adaptations such as sticky trichomes or pitfall traps of protocarnivorous plants parallel <b>the</b> <b>trap</b> structures of confirmed carnivorous plants.|$|E
5|$|A {{trap crop}} is {{a crop of}} a plant that attracts pests, {{diverting}} them from nearby crops. Pests aggregated on <b>the</b> <b>trap</b> crop can be more easily controlled using pesticides or other methods. However, trap-cropping, on its own, has often failed to cost effectively reduce pest densities on large commercial scales, {{without the use of}} pesticides, possibly due to the pests' ability to disperse back into the main field.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>traps</b> {{were built}} by a {{business}} studies group at Fiordland College {{in order to gain}} the capital for their business project. <b>The</b> <b>traps</b> were then distributed throughout <b>the</b> network of <b>trap</b> lines in <b>the</b> Kepler area largely by the community. Now <b>the</b> <b>traps</b> are checked every 6 weeks, with some trap lines being 'operated' by community groups.|$|R
50|$|Only {{visible at}} low tide <b>the</b> <b>traps</b> were {{described}} by George Vancouver in 1791.

60|$|This {{time it was}} easy, {{because they}} knew just where <b>the</b> <b>traps</b> were, so all day long they dropped sticks and stones into <b>the</b> <b>traps</b> and once more sprung them.

5|$|The bear follows {{and climbs}} {{on top of}} the Jeep, smashing up the car and {{eventually}} overturning it before leaving as the sun sets. Sean wakes up and tells them about the hunting paraphernalia, crying about wanting to go home before he dies. Wes and Lauren turn the Jeep right side up, load him back in the car, then push the Jeep down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits. Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing, they arrive near the buildings. While Lauren is exploring the building with <b>the</b> <b>trap,</b> the bear swings at her through a window sending her back against <b>the</b> <b>trap,</b> which impales her back. She returns to the vehicle where the bear rips off the tailgate and drags away Sean's body.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} (28 November), the French Emperor {{requested}} a personal interview with Alexander I {{and received a}} visit from the Tsar's most impetuous aide, Count Dolgorouki. The meeting was another part of <b>the</b> <b>trap,</b> as Napoleon intentionally expressed anxiety and hesitation to his opponents. Dolgorouki reported to the Tsar an additional indication of French weakness.|$|E

50|$|When {{preparing}} new traps, some trappers {{prefer to}} allow them {{be exposed to the}} elements for several weeks. They allow <b>the</b> <b>traps</b> to rust before dyeing and waxing them. Used traps are prepared before the start of <b>the</b> <b>trapping</b> season. <b>The</b> <b>traps</b> are prepared by divesting them as much as possible of all scents associated with humans. The main method is to boil <b>the</b> <b>traps</b> along with walnut bark or walnut hulls. The natural tannins of the walnut wood destroy or mask all adherent scents. After an hour of boiling traps in a large pot, beeswax may be added to the pot, and shortly after this <b>the</b> <b>traps</b> can be removed. <b>The</b> <b>traps</b> will be lightly coated with the beeswax, which covers the scent of the metal. The beeswax is also effective at preventing corrosion. The beeswax treatment is not used with conibear traps.|$|R
30|$|Expressions for the {{dispersion}} relation, {{the condition}} of <b>the</b> <b>trapped</b> mode, <b>the</b> transmission coefficient, and the instantaneous field components through the graphene stack are derived. Evanescent mode coupling to the graphene-dielectric stack arises at the discrete frequencies of <b>the</b> <b>trapped</b> modes. When <b>the</b> wavevector is perturbed, resonances occur around <b>the</b> <b>trapped</b> modes which results in transmission anomalies and dramatic field amplification in graphene stacks.|$|R
5|$|Though the sagas {{agree that}} Olaf Tryggvason had only 11 {{ships in the}} battle, some of them quote a verse by Halldórr the Unchristian saying that Olaf had 71 ships when he sailed from the south. The sagas explain the {{discrepancy}} by saying {{that some of the}} 71 ships belonged to Jarl Sigvaldi, who deserted Olaf, and that others sailed past <b>the</b> <b>trap</b> at Svolder before it was sprung.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{diversification}} in markets and products, Argentina managed to escape <b>the</b> <b>trap</b> of a single-staple economy and sustained its economic growth over six decades. The combined effect of declining prices of textiles and rising prices of livestock products produced dramatic improvements in the terms of trade, which rose 377% between 1810 and 1825 in local prices. Several governors waged campaigns against the natives to increase the available lands, from Juan Manuel de Rosas to Julio Argentino Roca.|$|E
5|$|At Borden's murder trial, Angier's ingénieur John Cutter testifies how Borden {{pushed the}} water tank under <b>the</b> <b>trap</b> door {{to catch and}} kill Angier during his New Transported Man trick. In prison, Borden is visited by an agent of Lord Caldlow, who offers to care for Borden's {{daughter}} Jess in exchange for all of Borden's tricks. As a show of good faith, Caldlow gives Borden a copy of Angier's diary, which Borden reads.|$|E
40|$|The {{position}} of <b>the</b> <b>trapping</b> boundary for ions {{not less than}} 24 keV {{in the vicinity of}} the magnetopause was determined using energetic particle three-dimensional distributions observed by ISEE 1 and 2. For a short period of time on November 20, 1977, definite periods were observed when the subsolar magnetopause current and magnetosheath plasma penetration layers were not overlapping <b>the</b> <b>trapping</b> region for energetic particles whose outer edge is <b>the</b> <b>trapping</b> boundary. <b>The</b> <b>trapping</b> boundary was found to be in rapid continual motion, representing a sharp, well-defined boundary, and the penetration of the magnetosheath plasma inside this boundary can be limited to a distance comparable to the plasma ion gyroradius of not greater than about 100 km, although plasma penetration was seen up to 200 km earthward of <b>the</b> <b>trapping</b> boundary...|$|R

40|$|A {{key element}} in the {{generation}} of optical torque in optical traps, which occurs when electromagnetic angular momentum is transferred from <b>the</b> <b>trapping</b> beam to <b>the</b> <b>trapped</b> particle by scattering, is the symmetries of the scattering particle and <b>the</b> <b>trapping</b> beam.

5|$|Finally, Putnam's {{internal}} realism {{has been}} accused by Curtis Brown of being a disguised form of subjective idealism. If this is the case, it {{is subject to the}} traditional arguments against that position. In particular, it falls into <b>the</b> <b>trap</b> of solipsism. That is, if existence depends on experience, as subjective idealism maintains, and if one's consciousness were to stop existing, then the rest of the universe would stop existing as well.|$|E
5|$|Later inhabitation of Southcote was {{discovered}} at Anslow's Cottages {{south of the}} Kennet, where excavation suggests that a Bronze Age waterfront was made on {{a branch of the}} river. A 1991 report by the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England—now known as English Heritage—detailed the discovery of fragments of twined basketry at Anslow's Cottages, showing that eel or fish traps were used on the river near Southcote. Archaeological findings of timber structures adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>trap</b> suggest that it dated from the eight or ninth century. Later discoveries, made in the 1980s during gravel extraction in the area, also uncovered evidence of a landing stage or jetty on the river channel.|$|E
5|$|Maha Chakkraphat saw the Burmese army's retreat as an {{opportunity}} {{take advantage of their}} weakness, so he ordered Princes Ramesuan and Thammaracha to follow and harass the enemy out of Siamese territory. For three days, the Siamese chased the invaders, inflicting great losses upon them. Once the forces of Ramesuan and Thammaracha closed in, Tabinshwehti made a stand near Kamphaeng Phet, dividing his forces {{on both sides of the}} road. The Siamese in their eagerness fell into <b>the</b> <b>trap.</b> The Burmese captured both Prince Ramesuan and Maha Thammaracha as prisoners of war.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a quantitative analysis of <b>the</b> <b>trapping</b> probability for <b>the</b> DNA <b>trap,</b> {{which is a}} method of trapping and concentrating DNA in a tapered microchannel by electric and hydrodrag force fields. In order to calculate <b>the</b> <b>trapping</b> probability, a series of connections of triangle-shaped taper stages was used. The fluorescent intensity of trapped DNA molecules at each stage was measured. <b>The</b> <b>trapping</b> probability per stage was calculated from {{the distribution of the}} fluorescent increase rate along with the stage number. <b>The</b> <b>trapping</b> probabilities were measured as a function of DNA size, electric field, and average hydraulic velocity. The electric field that gives a trap probability of 0. 5 was found to be proportional to the average hydraulic velocity for all DNA sizes. For all measured conditions and accuracy, <b>the</b> <b>trapping</b> probability was found to be determined only by the ratio of the electric field to the average hydraulic velocity. These results reveal that <b>the</b> DNA <b>trap</b> is not simply caused by balance between the dielectrophoresis and hydrodrag forces...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} 1600 {{parallel}} microchamber microfluidic device for fast sample array preparation using the immiscibility of two liquids. <b>The</b> <b>trapping</b> efficiency {{and size of}} the arrayed sample in the microchambers of a parallel microfluidic device were analyzed at various flow rates. <b>The</b> <b>trapping</b> efficiency of <b>the</b> sample was also inspected according to the position of the microchamber.

As the distance of the microchambers from the inlet increased, <b>the</b> sample <b>trapping</b> efficiency decreased. This tendency occurred more clearly at higher flow rates...|$|R
40|$|Near-forward {{scattering}} of an optically trapped 5 m radius polystyrene latex sphere by <b>the</b> <b>trapping</b> beam was examined both theoretically and experimentally. Since <b>the</b> <b>trapping</b> beam is tightly focused, the beam fields superpose and {{interfere with the}} scattered fields in the forward hemisphere. The observed light intensity consists {{of a series of}} concentric bright and dark fringes centered about the forward scattering direction. Both the number of fringes and their contrast depend on the position of <b>the</b> <b>trapping</b> beam focal waist with respect to the sphere. The fringes are caused by diffraction due to the truncation of the tail of <b>the</b> <b>trapping</b> beam as <b>the</b> beam is transmitted through the sphere...|$|R

5|$|The {{expedition}} {{arrived on}} 22 July 1718, surprising and trapping a ship commanded by pirate Charles Vane. After negotiations failed, Vane used a captured French vessel as a fireship {{in an attempt}} to ram the naval vessels. The attempt failed, but the naval vessels were forced out of the west end of Nassau harbour, giving Vane's crew an opportunity to raid the town and secure the best local pilot. Vane and his men then escaped in a small sloop via the harbour's narrow east entrance. The pirates had evaded <b>the</b> <b>trap,</b> but Nassau and New Providence Island were in Rogers' hands.|$|E
