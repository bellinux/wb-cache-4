25|$|The {{foundation}} of a secure energy system is to need less energy in the first place, then <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> sources that are inherently invulnerable because they're diverse, dispersed, renewable, and mainly local. They're secure not because they're American but because of their design. Any highly centralised energy system—pipelines, nuclear plants, refineries—invite devastating attack. But invulnerable alternatives don't, and can't, fail on a large scale.|$|E
25|$|An imprisoned Billy then meets Juan Mendoza, {{for whom}} the bandits work. He reveals he is Billy's father. He {{explains}} Marisa was his woman, but she left him for Thomas McCall, and that the medallion she took from him {{is the key to}} the location of the Gold of Juarez. He sent his men to Hope <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> her, but when they found she didn't have it, they killed her and Thomas. Billy explains he lost the medallion in the river, but Mendoza doesn't believe him, and sends him into the desert, giving him one hour to find the gold, or he will kill Molly. Using his memory of the shape of the medallion and his mother's story, Billy is able to locate the Gold in a hidden underground passage. However, Mendoza has followed him, and attempts to kill him. Billy flees, and is rescued by Ray, who tells him to get to safety as he returns to Mendoza's alcazar to rescue Molly. Ray then reveals his own backstory; he and Thomas were running cattle over the Mexican border when they met Marisa. They both fell in love with her, although she was Mendoza's woman, and she chose Thomas over Ray. They fled to the caverns in which the Gold was hidden, but Ray tracked them. There, he confronted Thomas. Their younger brother, William, a priest, attempted to intervene, but Ray killed him. On that day, Ray renounced violence and embraced God. Believing the gold to be cursed, he, Marisa and Thomas agreed to leave it behind and seal the cavern.|$|E
500|$|The network had {{initially}} planned to place Star Trek in the 7:30pm Monday-night time slot freed up by The Man from U.N.C.L.E. completing its run. Instead, the enraged George Schlatter forced the network to insert Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In into the slot, and Roddenberry's series {{was moved to}} 10:00pm on Fridays. Realizing the show could not survive in that time slot and burned out from arguments with the network, Roddenberry resigned from the day-to-day running of Star Trek, although he continued to be credited as executive producer. Roddenberry cooperated with Stephen Edward Poe, writing as Stephen Whitfield, on the 1968 nonfiction book The Making of Star Trek for Ballantine Books, splitting the royalties evenly. Roddenberry explained to Whitfield: [...] "I had to get some money somewhere. I'm sure not going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the profits of Star Trek." [...] Herbert Solow and Robert H. Justman observed that Whitfield never regretted his 50-50 deal with Roddenberry, since it gave him [...] "the opportunity {{to become the first}} chronicler of television's successful unsuccessful series." [...] Whitfield had previously been the national advertising and promotion director for model makers Aluminum Model Toys, better known as [...] "AMT", which then held the Star Trek license, and moved to run Lincoln Enterprises, Roddenberry's company set up to sell the series' merchandise.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} features of Mount Athabasca is a horned-shaped tip near the top called the [...] "Silverhorn". The Silverhorn is one of the easier routes to the summit but requires more caution and ability than the normal route because of blue ice and falling ice from other parties. Although not apparent from the typical roadside view of the mountain, the south side of Silverhorn contains a scrambling route but one must still cross the north glacier <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> <b>From</b> the top of the Silverhorn, the summit is a rather easy 15-minute plod in good summer weather over the narrow snow-covered summit ridge.|$|R
60|$|I {{very much}} wanted one of the sorry old tables which the prisoners had spent so many years in ornamenting with their pocket-knives, but red tape was in the way. The {{custodian}} could not sell one without an order from a superior; and that superior would have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> HIS superior; and this one would have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> a higher one--and so on up and up until the faculty should sit on the matter and deliver final judgment. The system was right, and nobody could find fault with it; {{but it did not}} seem justifiable to bother so many people, so I proceeded no further. It might have cost me more than I could afford, anyway; for one of those prison tables, which was at the time in a private museum in Heidelberg, was afterward sold at auction for two hundred and fifty dollars. It was not worth more than a dollar, or possibly a dollar and half, before the captive students began their work on it. Persons who saw it at the auction said it was so curiously and wonderfully carved that it was worth the money that was paid for it.|$|E
