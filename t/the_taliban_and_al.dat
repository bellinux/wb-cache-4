Pakistan, a major ally of the US on war upon terror tried to quell the insurgents but did not succeed. The cross-border infiltration and attacks on US troops continued, causing serious doubts about Pakistan’s sincerity in the suppression of the militancy.

40|$|In Pakistan's {{struggles with}} Islamist militant groups [...] foreign and {{homegrown}} [...] the country's provinces have experienced levels {{of violence that}} differ widely by type, severity, and consequences. An analysis of a recent WorldPublicOpinion. org poll of Pakistan reveals that these different provinces vary significantly in their views of militant groups and the recent government's actions to an extent that is relevant for policymakers. Of special interest, support for the Pakistani government's efforts and concern about specific militant groups prove to be strong in some unexpected places. Pakistan is home to numerous ethnic groups, {{who tend to be}} clustered in specific provinces, e. g. : Punjabis tends to be clustered in the Punjab, Pashtuns in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP), the Baluch in Baluchistan and Sindhis in Sindh. Of course, there has been tremendous migration within Pakistan. Karachi, in Sindh, is now to home to more Pashtuns than any other city in Pakistan and ethnic Punjabis are settled throughout Pakistan. Indeed, these internal demographic changes have often been a source of conflict among different ethnic groups. While many U. S. analysts focus upon "Pakistan," and "Pakistani opinions," it is useful to consider sub-national analyses of data. For example, provinces differ by voting patterns, access to education and other public services, representation in government institutions (including the armed forces), and literacy among other factors. These enormous inter-provincial differences tend to be overlooked by policy makers. This paper begins with the opinion survey's timing, its methodology, and a few caveats on its provincial comparisons. It then offers a brief summary of provincial differences in attitudes. It then considers the provincial responses to specific questions on three topics: beliefs about Islamist militants' activities and objectives; views of the Pakistani government and its response to the militants, especially in Swat; and attitudes toward foreign militant groups, <b>the</b> Afghan <b>Taliban</b> <b>and</b> <b>al</b> Qaeda...|$|R

She further challenged the government of Pakistan to provide accurate figures about the 'civilian' casualties and tell what methodology was used to collect this data. According to her 'The people of Waziristan are suffering a brutal kind of occupation under <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> <b>and</b> <b>al</b> Qaeda.

40|$|The {{threat of}} another major {{terrorist}} {{attack in the}} United States remains high, with the greatest danger coming from local extremists inspired by events in the Middle East. Although the United States removed <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> government <b>and</b> destroyed <b>al</b> Qaeda’s training camps in Afghanistan, events in Europe and elsewhere {{have shown that the}} terrorist network leadership remains determined to carry out further attacks and is capable of doing so. Therefore, the United States must systematically conduct research on terrorist strikes against transportation targets to distill lessons learned and determine the best practices for deterrence, response, and recovery. Those best practices must be taught to transportation and security professionals to provide secureÂ surface transportation for the nation. Studying recent incidents in Europe and Asia, along with other research, will help leaders in the United States learn valuable lessons—from preventing attacks, to response and recovery, to addressing the psychological impacts of attacks to business continuity. Timely distillations of the lessons learned and best practices developed in other countries, once distributed to law enforcement, first responders, and rail- and subway-operating transit agencies, could result in the saving of American lives. This monograph focuses on the terrorist risks confronting public transportation in the United States—especially urban mass transit—and explores how different forms of passenger screening, and in particular, selective screening, can best be implemented to reduce those risks...|$|R
40|$|After the {{terrorist}} attacks of September 11 th the United States invaded Afghanistan <b>and</b> overthrew <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> in a quick and decisive war, effectively destroying {{the terrorist}} safe haven in the country. However, eight years later the U. S. and members of the international community remain there trying to keep terrorists and extremists from reestablishing their base in Afghanistan. To date we have only reached a fragile stalemate between the insurgency, composed of <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> <b>and</b> supported by <b>al</b> Qaeda, <b>and</b> the ISAF and U. S. forces within the country. Many argue we should give up in Afghanistan, believing our problems can be attributed to a poor strategy, a lack of resources, a lack of focus, or simply an unwinnable war. However, we now have a new President, a new commander in Afghanistan, and a new strategy that many have touted as a first step toward victory. This thesis examines the history of the battle for stability in Afghanistan, the history of insurgencies in the country, and other major issues challenging the rebuilding and stability of the failed state. The intent of this thesis is to contribute a further understanding of the conflict and challenges present in Afghanistan and its surrounding region. The effectiveness of the Obama administration's new strategy and direction in Afghanistan is also examined. While the new strategy is a step forward in Afghanistan, it is far from a silver bullet. Any victory still requires a true long-term commitment to the fight for stability in Afghanistan, the proper resources for the security of the Afghan people and an effective effort to eliminate the safe haven that now exists in Pakistan. Significant progress is achievable within the region. However, even if the Obama plan works as outlined true stability and success will not occur unless the U. S. and members of the international community avoid past mistakes...|$|R
