5|$|The Wiz {{was filmed}} at Astoria Studios in Queens, New York. The {{decaying}} New York State Pavilion from the 1964 New York World's Fair {{was used as}} the set for Munchkinland, Astroland at Coney Island was used for the <b>Tinman</b> scene with The Cyclone as a backdrop, while the World Trade Center served as the Emerald City. The scenes filmed at the Emerald City were elaborate, utilizing 650 dancers, 385 crew members and 1,200 costumes. Costume designer Tony Walton enlisted the help of high fashion designers in New York City for the Emerald City sequence, and obtained exotic costumes and fabric from designers such as Oscar de la Renta and Norma Kamali. Albert Whitlock created the film's visual special effects, while Stan Winston served as the head makeup artist.|$|E
25|$|A tinsmith, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} a whitesmith, tinner, tinker, <b>tinman,</b> or tinplate worker {{is a person who}} makes and repairs things made of tinware, or other light metals. By extension it can also refer to the person who deals in tinware, or tin plate.|$|E

Scientists have thus called this gene <b>tinman,</b> named after the Oz character of the same name. This system of nomenclature results in a wider range of gene names than in other organisms.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Kim Manners, who was extremely pleased with the final result. He explained, [...] "it {{was a lot of}} fun to shoot that show. It was the first show that the Gunmen carried and I had a real good time shepherding Tommy, Dean, and Bruce, 'cause [...] they were nervous, they had the whole hour to carry." [...] One scene with which Manners was extremely pleased was the shot wherein Susanne Modeski breaks into the Lone Gunmen's hotel room and the Gunmen cower in fear in a corner. Manners was inspired by the 1939 film adaption of The Wizard of Oz, most specifically the image of [...] " [...] the Scarecrow, and the <b>Tinman,</b> and the Lion [...] shaking behind Dorothy." [...] Manners later noted that the sequence [...] "really worked out well".|$|E

60|$|The town is, certainly, {{the most}} moral of towns. You pass from the {{railroad}} station through a long, lonely suburb, with dusty rows of stunted trees on either side, and some few miserable beggars, idle boys, and ragged old women under them. Behind {{the trees are}} gaunt, mouldy houses; palaces once, where (in {{the days of the}} unbought grace of life) the cheap defence of nations gambled, ogled, swindled, intrigued; whence high-born duchesses used to issue, in old times, to act as chambermaids to lovely Du Barri; and mighty princes rolled away, in gilt caroches, hot for the honor of lighting his Majesty to bed, or of presenting his stockings when he rose, or of holding his napkin when he dined. Tailors, chandlers, <b>tinmen,</b> wretched hucksters, and greengrocers, are now established in the mansions of the old peers; small children are yelling at the doors, with mouths besmeared with bread and treacle; damp rags are hanging out of every one of the windows, steaming in the sun; oyster-shells, cabbage-stalks, broken crockery, old papers, lie basking in the same cheerful light. A solitary water-cart goes jingling down the wide pavement, and spirts a feeble refreshment over the dusty, thirsty stones.|$|R
6000|$|There is no {{animal fibre}} {{that will not}} yield itself up to long-continued, steady heat. But the {{difficulty}} with almost any of the common servants who call themselves cooks is, {{that they have not}} the smallest notion of the philosophy of the application of heat. Such a one will complacently tell you, concerning certain meats, that the harder you boil them the harder they grow,--an obvious fact, which, under her mode of treatment by an indiscriminate galloping boil, has frequently come under her personal observation. If you tell her that such meat must stand for six hours in a heat just below the boiling-point, she will probably answer, [...] "Yes, ma'am," [...] and go on her own way. Or she will let it stand till it burns {{to the bottom of the}} kettle,--a most common termination of the experiment. The only way to make sure of the matter is either to import a French kettle, or to fit into an ordinary kettle a false bottom, such as any <b>tinman</b> may make, that shall leave a space of an inch or two between the meat and the fire. This kettle may be maintained as a constant habitué of the range, and into it the cook may be instructed to throw all the fibrous trimmings of meat, all the gristle, tendons, and bones, having previously broken up these last with a mallet.|$|E
6000|$|Close at {{his heels}} walked his hired attendant, whom, out of insolent caprice and {{with a desire to}} show his {{contempt}} for the prejudices of others, he had dressed as a rough country clergyman. This fellow slouched along with frowning brows and surly, challenging eyes, like some faithful, hideous human bulldog, his knotted hands protruding from his rusty cassock, his great underhung jaw turning slowly from right to left as he menaced the crowd with his sinister gaze. Already a close observer might have marked upon his face a heaviness and looseness of feature, the first signs of that physical decay which in a very few years was to stretch him, a helpless wreck, too weak to utter his own name, upon the causeway of the London streets. At present, however, he was still an unbeaten man, the terror of the Ring, and as his ill-omened face was seen behind his infamous master many a half-raised cane was lowered and many a hot word was checked, while the whisper of [...] "Hooper! 'Ware Bully Hooper!" [...] warned all who were aggrieved that it might be best to pocket their injuries lest some even worse thing should befall them. Many a maimed and disfigured man had carried away from Vauxhall the handiwork of the <b>Tinman</b> and his patron.|$|E
6000|$|The general {{size of a}} {{store in}} Tangier is about that of an {{ordinary}} shower bath in a civilized land. The Muhammadan merchant, <b>tinman,</b> shoemaker, or vendor of trifles sits {{cross-legged on the floor}} and reaches after any article you may want to buy. You can rent a whole block of these pigeonholes for fifty dollars a month. The market people crowd the marketplace with their baskets of figs, dates, melons, apricots, etc., and among them file trains of laden asses, not much larger, if any, than a Newfoundland dog. The scene is lively, is picturesque, and smells like a police court. The Jewish money-changers have their dens close at hand, and all day long are counting bronze coins and transferring them from one bushel basket to another. They don't coin much money nowadays, I think. I saw none but what was dated four or five hundred years back, and was badly worn and battered. These coins are not very valuable. Jack went out to get a napoleon changed, so as to have money suited to the general cheapness of things, and came back and said he had [...] "swamped the bank, had bought eleven quarts of coin, {{and the head of the}} firm had gone on the street to negotiate for the balance of the change." [...] I bought nearly half a pint of their money for a shilling myself. I am not proud on account of having so much money, though. I care nothing for wealth.|$|E

Or, to put him aside, he being in loyal attendance on his Chief, was there not Private Hyppolite, billeted at the Perfumer's two hundred yards off, who, when not on duty, volunteered to keep shop while the fair Perfumeress stepped out {{to speak to a}} neighbour or so, and laughingly sold soap with his war-sword girded on him? Was there not Emile, billeted at the Clock-maker's, perpetually turning to of an evening, with his coat off, winding up the stock? Was there not Eugene, billeted at the Tinman's, cultivating, pipe in mouth, a garden four feet square, for the <b>Tinman,</b> in the little court, behind the shop, and extorting the fruits of the earth from the same, on his knees, with the sweat of his brow? Not to multiply examples, was there not Baptiste, billeted on the poor Water-carrier, at that very instant sitting on the pavement in the sunlight, with his martial legs asunder, and one of the Water-carrier's spare pails between them, which (to the delight and glory of the heart of the Water-carrier coming across the Place from the fountain, yoked and burdened) he was painting bright-green outside and bright-red within? Or, to go no farther than the Barber's at the very next door, was there not Corporal Theophile-- ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1860 he {{revisited}} Cornwall with F. T. Palgrave, Mr Val Prinsep, and Mr Holman Hunt. They walked in the rain, saw Tintagel and the Scilly Isles, and were feted by an enthusiastic captain of a little river steamer, who {{was more interested in}} [...] "Mr <b>Tinman</b> and Mr Pancake" [...] than the Celtic boatman of Ardtornish. The winter was passed at Farringford, and the Northern Farmer was written there, a Lincolnshire reminiscence, in the February of 1861. In autumn the Pyrenees were visited by Tennyson in company with Arthur Clough and Mr Dakyns of Clifton College. At Cauteretz in August, and among memories of the old tour with Arthur Hallam, was written All along the Valley. The ways, however, in Auvergne were [...] "foul," [...] and the diet [...] "unhappy." [...] The dedication of the Idylls was written on the death of the Prince Consort in December, and in January 1862 the Ode for the opening of an exhibition. The poet was busy with his [...] "Fisherman," [...] Enoch Arden. The volume was published in 1864, and Lord Tennyson says it has been, next to In Memoriam, the most popular of his father's works. One would have expected the one volume containing the poems up to 1842 to hold that place. The new book, however, mainly dealt with English, contemporary, and domestic themes--"the poetry of the affections." [...] An old woman, a district visitor reported, regarded Enoch Arden as [...] "more beautiful" [...] than the other tracts which were read to her. It is indeed a tender and touching tale, based on a folk-story which Tennyson found current in Brittany as well as in England. Nor is the unseen and unknown landscape of the tropic isle less happily created by the poet's imagination than the familiar English cliffs and hazel copses:- ...|$|E
