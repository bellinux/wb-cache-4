The gauge operates {{on the principle}} of thermal exchange between the voltage-biased nanotube and the surrounding gas at low levels of power and low temperatures to measure vacuum across a wide dynamic range. The gauge includes two terminals, a source of constant voltage to the terminals, a single-walled carbon nanotube between the terminals, a calibration of measured conductance of the nanotube to magnitudes of surrounding vacuum and a current meter in electrical communication with the source of constant voltage. Employment of the nanotube for measuring vacuum includes calibrating the electrical conductance of the nanotube to magnitudes of vacuum, exposing the nanotube to a vacuum, applying a constant voltage across the nanotube, measuring the electrical conductance of the nanotube in the vacuum with the constant voltage applied and converting the measured electrical conductance to the corresponding calibrated magnitude of vacuum using the calibration. The nanotube may be suspended to minimize heat dissipation through the substrate, increasing sensitivity at even tower pressures...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> <b>gauges</b> rely on {{the fact}} that the ability of a gas to conduct heat {{decreases}} with pressure. In this type of gauge, a wire filament is heated by running current through it. A [...] thermocouple or Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD) can then be used to measure the temperature of the filament. This temperature is dependent on the rate at which the filament loses heat to the surrounding gas, and therefore on the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity.</b> A common variant is the Pirani gauge which uses a single platinum filament as both the heated element and RTD. These gauges are accurate from 10 torr to 10−3 torr, but they are sensitive to the chemical composition of the gases being measured.|$|R

30|$|The <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> {{of various}} {{nanocomposite}} samples has been analyzed {{in this section}} (Table 5 and Fig. 8). There is no significant difference among the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> values of different EVA grades. Addition of 4 wt% of expanded graphite increases the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> several folds over the neat elastomers. Increments are more prominent in the high VA-containing grades. Due to their inherent superior <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity,</b> MWCNTs provide highest enhancement in <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> in various matrices. The <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> enhancement of polymer nanocomposites depends {{to a large extent}} on the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> of nanoscale fillers and their structural properties [31]. Even though CNF has higher aspect ratio, its intrinsic <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> is about 2000 W/mK which is much lower than that of MWCNT which is 3000 W/mK [32]. In spite of the higher polymer–filler interaction revealed by Vr values, CNF-based composites register lower <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> values because of the above reason. Interfacial bonding between filler and polymer plays a vital role on the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> of the resulting nanocomposites following earlier references [33]. In the present case, however, the MWCNT shows a relatively poorer dispersion and also the swelling resistance is lower than that of CNF-based composites.
