50|$|Control of the 12-15 cwt {{model was}} by a bar-type {{accelerator}} pedal, which controlled {{the operation of}} several electro-magnetic contactors. Series resistances were used to limit the current {{on the first two}} stages of the controller. The front hubs were mounted on <b>taper</b> <b>roller</b> bearings, while the back axle included double-reduction gearing and a removable differential, to assist maintenance. The transmission between the motor and the rear axle was by a shaft fitted with two Hardy Spicer universal joints. The brakes were manufactured by the Bendix Corporation, and both the foot and hand brakes operated on all four wheels. Although all models seemed to be classified as 12-15 cwt, the standard design had a load platform which was 8 ft long, while short chassis and long chassis variants were also produced, with platforms of 7.25 ft and 9 ft.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tapered</b> <b>roller</b> {{bearings}} use conical rollers {{that run}} on conical races. Most roller bearings only take radial or axial loads, but <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> bearings support both radial and axial loads, and generally can carry higher loads than ball bearings due to greater contact area. <b>Tapered</b> <b>roller</b> bearings are used, for example, as the wheel bearings of most wheeled land vehicles. The downsides to this bearing is that due to manufacturing complexities, <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> bearings are usually more expensive than ball bearings; and additionally under heavy loads the <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> is like a wedge and bearing loads tend to try to eject the roller; the force from the collar which keeps the roller in the bearing adds to bearing friction compared to ball bearings.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} jerk signal, a signal obtained from differentiation of the acceleration signal with respect to time, for detecting the early damage of a bearing and bad lubrication conditions. The use of jerk signal is expected to result more sensitive detection than that obtain using acceleration signal. To prove this hypothesis, this paper shows the results of vibration measurement for needle bearings and <b>taper</b> <b>roller</b> bearings with variation of load level, types of bearing damage, and lubrication condition. Comparisons of acceleration and jerk signals are performed in both time domain, by comparing their RMS values, {{as well as in}} frequency domain, by comparing their spectrums. The results of the experiment show that the use of jerk signal can give a more sensitive result in detecting bearing damage than that produced using acceleration signal. Moreover, the use of jerk signal can lead to better results in detecting bad lubrication of rolling bearing than that obtain using Crest Factor (CF) value...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} experiments per-formed towards diagnosis of localized defects in <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> bearings, using High Frequency Resonance Technique (HFRT).

To practically test this technique, an experimental setup was designed and fabricated for testing various <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> bearings to obtain their vibration characteristics. For the purpose of testing, a few defect-free and defective <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> bearings were tested using the fabricated set up-the defective bearings tested included bearings with outer race defects, roller defects and combination of both.
