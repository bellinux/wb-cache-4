5000|$|The Dialytrauma Concept was {{introduced}} into medical literature in 2008 by a Spanish group of intensivists. The idea was born {{as a consequence}} of the publication of the first major trial (known as the ATN Study) looking at the intensity of renal support in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). In this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, renal support was delivered using different RRT modalities: intermittent hemodialysis, sustained low-efficiency dialysis, or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. The main result of this study (including 1,124 patients) was that a fixed “intensive” dose (35 mL/Kg/h) delivered with different RRT modalities, produced the same clinical outcomes than a “less-intensive” dose (20 mL/Kg/h). The authors’ conclusion was that critically ill patients with AKI requiring RRT should be treated with this “less-intensive” dose, given that it will achieve the same results as the “intensive” one. Nevertheless, the rate of complications and adverse events detected was higher in the “intensive” dose arm of this study. As such, the aforementioned Spanish group of intensivists, wrote a letter to the Editor of the same Journal2 postulating the idea that all those complications (grouped under the term “Dialytrauma”) could have been responsible for the results of the ATN Study.In the same letter to the Editor, and according to what had been previously published by Dr. Schiffl, they hypothesized that a dynamic adjustment of the dose of RRT, would be more physiological due to the dynamic nature of AKI in critical illness. This <b>therapeutic</b> <b>schedule,</b> named “Dynamic Approach”, would reduce the incidence of dialytrauma and, probably, would achieve better clinical outcomes.However, given the lack of level 1 clinical trials on this “Theory of Dynamic Approach”, the authors of the ATN Study branded this idea as being “speculative”. Despite this, a year later Dr. Palevsky (ATN Study’s first author) wrote an Editorial comment on the RENAL Study (the second major trial looking at the intensity of renal support) concluding that the: [...] Failure to demonstrate improved outcomes with more intensive renal-replacement therapy in critically ill patients … does not imply that the intensity of renal-replacement therapy does not matter. ... Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that patient care needs to be individualized - more intensive therapy may be required for the treatment of hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, or extreme hypercatabolism - and that the true adequacy of renal-replacement therapy is defined by more than just the clearance of small solutes. Palevsky PM,«Renal Support in Acute Kidney Injury — How Much Is Enough?» (2009)N Engl J Med 361(17):1699-1701. [...] In this way, finally, he seemed to support the Theory of Dynamic Approach, that is: we need to tailor the RRT dose to the clinical scenario of the individual patient. From then on, both the Dialytrauma Concept and the Theory of Dynamic Approach have been referenced in several publications by impact groups in the field of RRT.|$|E

Tail-nerve conduction velocities (NCV) was assessed at 5 and 11 weeks for the preventive and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>schedule,</b> respectively. Compared to nondiabetic rats, NCV was 20 % lower after 5 weeks in the STZ group, and this decrease was attenuated 50 % by rhEPO.

40|$|Background: The {{different}} <b>therapeutic</b> <b>schedules</b> {{used for}} the prescription of digoxin have little theoretical support. Aim: To measure digoxin plasma levels in patients using four different prescription schedules. Patients and methods: Four groups of patients were studied. Group I corresponded to 56 patients taking digoxin 0. 25 mg/day, from Monday to Friday. Group II corresponded to 30 patients taking digoxin 0. 25 mg/day, from Monday to Saturday. Group III corresponded to 53 patients taking digoxin 0. 25 mg/day continuosly. Group IV corresponded to 36 patients taking digoxin 0. 125 mg/day continuosly. Plasma digoxin levels were measured in two consecutive Mondays before taking the daily dose of the drug. Serum creatinine was also measured and creatinine clearance was calculated. The therapeutic plasma concentration range was set between 0. 5 and 2 ng/ml. Results: Mean plasma digoxin levels were 1. 15 ± 0. 8 ng/ml in group I, 1. 4 ± 0. 55 ng/ml in group II, 1. 68 ± 0. 7 ng/ml in group III and 1. 14 ± 0. 43 ng/ml in group IV. 93 % of patients in group I, 80 % of patients in group II, 75 % of patients in group III and 94 % of patients in group IV had therapeutic digoxin levels.

40|$|Autoimmune {{hepatitis}} is {{an acute}} or mostly chronic liver disease {{that can affect}} both adults and children and has a clear prevalence for the female sex. A definite etiology has not been established, but {{it is known that}} genetic predisposing profiles and exogenous trigger factors are involved. The main diagnostic criteria include typical histological features, the occurrence of serum auto-antibodies, and increased levels of transaminases and gamma-globulins. Instances of autoimmune hepatitis sharing features with other autoimmune liver diseases have also been observed. An imbalance of the immune system with persistent activation of effector T cells has been emphasized to account for the sustained liver injury. Clinical manifestations are variable both at presentation and throughout the course of the disease, ranging from an asymptomatic state or the occurrence of non-specific symptoms to the features of end-stage liver disease such as jaundice, ascites, and gastrointestinal bleeding. A clinical and biochemical remission is achieved in at least 80 % of patients receiving corticosteroids with or without the addition of azathioprine. Alternative <b>therapeutic</b> <b>schedules</b> have been proposed for unresponsive and intolerant patients. Given that relapse often occurs after therapy withdrawal, maintenance treatment is usually required...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{investigate}} {{response to}} sequential treatment schedules {{and risk of}} development of refractory epilepsy in childhood. MethodsAll children younger than 14 years with two or more unprovoked seizures seen at our hospital between 1994 and 2004 were included and prospectively followed. “Seizure control” {{was defined as a}} 2 -year seizure-free interval without further recurrences except those related to attempts of medication withdrawal and “refractory epilepsy” as failure of > 2 drugs plus > 1 seizure/month for ≥ 18 months. Results 343 Patients were included, 191 males and 152 females. Mean age at diagnosis was 4 y 10 mo (SD 3 year 10 month). Mean follow-up period was 76. 2 mo (SD 35. 2). The probability of achieving “seizure control” was 70 % and 86 % at 5 and 10 years. 59 % of patients were “controlled” with the first drug used. Among patients failing the first, second and third therapeutic regimen due to lack of efficacy, 39 %, 23 % and 12 % respectively were finally “controlled” with subsequent treatment schedules Risk of development of refractory epilepsy was 8 % and 12 % at 6 and 10 years. ConclusionAfter failing a first drug, a significant proportion of children can still be controlled with subsequent <b>therapeutic</b> <b>schedules.</b> Only a small proportion develops refractory epilepsy...|$|R
