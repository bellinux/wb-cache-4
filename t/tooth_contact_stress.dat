40|$|Thin-rim gears {{are often}} used in {{applications}} where light weight and compact design are demanded. Since the gear rim is more rigid {{in the area of}} the gear web, this influences the load as well as the contact stress distribution along the tooth face width. Conventional standard procedures for gear design assume uniform rigidity along the face width and therefore are not fully applicable to the thinrim gears <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> <b>stress</b> calculation. The objective of this paper is to evaluate effect of web arrangement on a thin-rim gear tooth contact stresses using advanced engineering tools for a numeric analysis. Three-dimensional parametric finite element model of thin-rim gear engaged with a solid gear is created. The gear pair contact position is chosen to load the thin-rim gear (the wheel) at the highest point of single tooth contact assuming small sliding and dry frictionless contact. Commercial finite element package Abaqus/Standard is used to determine contact stresses assuming small displacement hypothesis. The material is considered homogenous and isotropic with a linear elastic behavior. Obtained <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> <b>stress</b> contour lines as well as the maximum <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> <b>stress</b> values for various thin-rim gear web arrangements are presented...|$|E

Field measured time series of SCADA signals, including wind speed, generator power and rotational speed, were used to obtain the statistical variation of gear shaft torque and rotational speed. From the SCADA data obtained over a 2. 2 year period random number datasets of smaller sizes were selected. Based on these random number datasets the effect of gear shaft torque and rotational speed variations on the probabilistic risk of gear micro-pitting was investigated. Determinations of the gear <b>tooth</b> flank <b>contact</b> <b>stress</b> and lubricant film thickness were based on the technical report of gear micro-pitting, ISO/TR 15144 - 1 (2010).

There are two types of stresses that occur on gears âbending stress at the root of the <b>teeth</b> and <b>contact</b> <b>stress</b> at the surface of the teeth. The aim of this paper is to present results of theoretical and finite element studyof <b>contact</b> <b>stress</b> of spur gears. The geometry of spur gears simulated was taken from the gears of nut stirrer in PT. Garuda Food Bandar Lampung. Finite element modeling and analysis was done using ANSYS commersial software. PLANE 183 element type was employed for gears with TARGE 169 and CONTA 172 used for modeling of surface-to-surface, flexible contact. Finite element analysis shows pressure contact of 1702 MPa, while the results of using theory of Hertz and AGMA design by rule shows pressure contact of 1826. 2 MPa and 1650. 9 MPa respectively. The relative difference of pressure contact between FEA and theory of Hertz is 6. 8 %, while between FEA and AGMA design by rule is 3 %. For three dimensional stress in term of von-Mises stress, calculated stress using approach of two-cylinder in contacts is 1378. 0 MPa, while theresults obtained using ANSYS simulation is 1601 MPa â they different by 13. 9 %.

40|$|AbstractA {{fabrication}} {{method is}} adopted for which an imaginary gear simultaneously realizes conjugated meshing with an arc tooth cylindrical gear and an arc tooth face-gear. The cutter fillet and tooth crest edge form the tooth root fillet of the gear, and the linear tooth surface equation of the imaginary gear and the position vector of the curvature center of the cutter fillet are constructed with certain cutter inclination to deduce a working arc tooth surface equation. The tooth root fillet equation of the arc tooth face-gear {{is derived from the}} meshing geometry and kinematics. A numerically controlled machining model of the arc tooth face-gear is established through the transformation of adjustment parameters from the cutter-tilt milling machine to a common multi-axis NC machine. Motion parameters of each movement axis of the NC machine are acquired. A processing example is presented to verify the precision of the fabrication method in processing the arc tooth face-gear.

40|$|The gear meshing is {{very complex}} process as high {{non-linearity}} behaviour is involved during the process. Normally most analysis of gear <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> {{is on the}} basis of a hypothesis that the <b>contacted</b> gear <b>teeth</b> are cantilever beams to obtain the approximate results quickly. However, many important factors have been ignored in simulating gear <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> using cantilever beam hypothesis, those factors include tooth profile variations, gear rotation speed and input torque, coefficient of friction and geometry distortion. Many of non-linear responses such as noise, vibration, abrasion and so on make the actual contact process much more complicated than those in the cantilever beam hypothesis although it is a reliable reference for integrated gear performance investigation. The main contribution of this thesis is in the investigation of the typical static and dynamic performances of meshing gears by simulating gears rolling-sliding contact processes using non-linear finite element method. A typical spur gear model has been proposed first for performance analysis and the model with integrated parameters could contribute reliable finite element conditions to simulate actual gear meshing. The bending stress and its resultant <b>stress</b> of <b>contacted</b> <b>teeth</b> with static model and dynamic model have been then simulated and the results can be used to provide information on the <b>contacted</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>stresses</b> distribution. The detailed investigation of transmission error in gear meshing has been carried out to understand harmful noise and vibration of gear set and a micro geometry modification of gear tooth profile has been proposed, i. e. tip relief. The gear contact pressure distributions and transmission errors have been then analyzed with micro geometry modification and the analysis is under static and dynamic boundary conditions. Finally, the most significant contribution of the thesis is the investigation of the frictional effect on dynamic performance, including dynamic stress and transmission errors.

40|$|The {{study of}} elastohydrodynamic {{lubrication}} (EHL) with rough surfaces {{results in a}} transient problem due to time varying geometry. In conditions where the A ratio (the ratio of smooth surface film thickness to composite roughness) is low, significant pressure deviations from the corresponding smooth surface results occur. The relative motion of asperity features on the two surfaces leads to cycling of these pressure deviations as surface features move through the nominal contact area. Micropitting, which {{is a form of}} surface distress seen in gears, may well be viewed as rolling contact fatigue at the roughness asperity scale {{as a result of this}} load cycling. In order to understand the failure mechanism associated with rough surface EHL, a full theoretical model of lubrication of gear contacts under low A conditions is presented in this thesis. The model takes account of the real gear operating conditions in terms of loads, speeds, surface roughness and lubricant properties to predict pressures, film thickness, temperatures, and friction between the <b>teeth.</b> Subsequent <b>contact</b> <b>stress</b> analysis was performed to determine the stress history developed in the contacting solids. Conventional pitting is usually associated with failure beneath the surface of a rolling contact and in the past has been linked with the occurrence of the maximum shear stress that occurs in the classical Hertzian solution for smooth surfaces. In this thesis, a numerical procedure for predicting contact fatigue damage in an EHL line contact between two rough surfaces is developed to take the features of variable amplitude multiaxial fatigue into account due to the roughness effect. The way in which the calculated fatigue damage varies with changes in factors such as slide roll ratio, speed, viscosity, rough surface profiles, and A ratio adopted for the analysis is demonstrated in a series of numerical examples using roughness profiles taken from gears in micropitting experiments...|$|R
