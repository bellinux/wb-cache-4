5|$|Binary search {{works on}} sorted arrays. Binary search begins by {{comparing}} the middle element of <b>the</b> <b>array</b> with the target value. If the target value matches the middle element, its position in <b>the</b> <b>array</b> is returned. If the target value is less than or greater than the middle element, the search continues in the lower or upper half of <b>the</b> <b>array,</b> respectively, eliminating the other half from consideration.|$|E
5|$|If {{the target}} value {{is greater than}} the {{greatest}} value in <b>the</b> <b>array,</b> and the last index of <b>the</b> <b>array</b> is the maximum representable value of L, the value of L will eventually become too large and overflow. A similar problem will occur if the target value is smaller than the least value in <b>the</b> <b>array</b> and the first index of <b>the</b> <b>array</b> is the smallest representable value of R. In particular, this means that R must not be an unsigned type if <b>the</b> <b>array</b> starts with index 0.|$|E
5|$|Linear {{search is}} a simple search {{algorithm}} that checks every record until it finds the target value. Linear search can be done on a linked list, which allows for faster insertion and deletion than an array. Binary search is faster than linear search for sorted arrays except if <b>the</b> <b>array</b> is short. If <b>the</b> <b>array</b> must first be sorted, that cost must be amortized over any searches. Sorting <b>the</b> <b>array</b> also enables efficient approximate matches and other operations.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} re-planning for the mission, {{the crews}} set {{to work in the}} morning {{deploying}} the solar wings on the S6 truss. To prepare for the extension of <b>the</b> <b>arrays,</b> <b>the</b> station was maneuvered into a position that allowed constant sunlight to hit <b>the</b> <b>arrays,</b> which allowed them to warm up and prevent what the mission team calls 'stiction', or a sticky friction that happens after <b>the</b> <b>arrays</b> have been in storage {{for an extended period of}} time.|$|R
50|$|Primary {{power for}} XMM-Newton is {{provided}} by two fixed solar <b>arrays.</b> <b>The</b> <b>arrays</b> are composed of six panels measuring 1.81 xx 1.94 m {{for a total of}} 21 m2 and a mass of 80 kg. At launch, <b>the</b> <b>arrays</b> provided 2,200 W of power, and were expected to provide 1,600 W after ten years of operation. Deployment of each array took four minutes. <b>The</b> <b>arrays</b> were provided by Fokker Space of the Netherlands.|$|R
50|$|The Linux {{scheduler}} was overhauled {{completely with}} the release of kernel 2.6. This new scheduler is called the O(1) scheduler. The algorithm used by the O(1) scheduler relies on active and expired arrays of processes to achieve constant scheduling time. Each process is given a fixed time quantum, after which it is preempted and moved to <b>the</b> expired <b>array.</b> Once all <b>the</b> tasks from <b>the</b> active <b>array</b> have exhausted their time quantum and have been moved to <b>the</b> expired <b>array,</b> an array switch takes place. Because <b>the</b> <b>arrays</b> are accessed only via pointer, switching them is as fast as swapping two pointers. This switch makes <b>the</b> active <b>array</b> <b>the</b> new empty expired <b>array,</b> while <b>the</b> expired <b>array</b> becomes <b>the</b> active <b>array.</b>|$|R
5|$|Alternatively, it is {{possible}} to use a lazy deletion strategy in which a key–value pair is removed by replacing the value by a special flag value indicating a deleted key. However, these flag values will contribute to the load factor of the hash table. With this strategy, it may become necessary to clean the flag values out of <b>the</b> <b>array</b> and rehash all the remaining key–value pairs once too large a fraction of <b>the</b> <b>array</b> becomes occupied by deleted keys.|$|E
5|$|The mission's only Extra-Vehicular Activity, or spacewalk, {{took place}} on May 12, between 10:44 and 15:36 UTC. The primary {{objectives}} of the spacewalk were to repair damage to Mir's exterior components and record panoramas of the station's hull in order for experts on Earth to analyze the effects of space on the station itself. The cosmonauts inspected a malfunctioning solar array on the Kvant-1 module of the station. They discovered that a burnt-through wire connecting <b>the</b> <b>array</b> with its steering system was preventing its proper rotation. <b>The</b> <b>array</b> was subsequently deemed a loss.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the longer}} shadow <b>the</b> <b>array</b> casts when tilted at a steeper angle, {{this area is}} {{typically}} about 10% higher for an adjustable tilt array or a single axis tracker, and 20% higher for a 2-axis tracker, though these figures will {{vary depending on the}} latitude and topography.|$|E

5|$|In addition, {{drugs such}} as NMDA {{receptor}} antagonists to halt neurochemical cascades such as excitotoxicity showed promise in animal trials but failed in clinical trials.

5|$|Range {{queries are}} also straightforward. Once {{the ranks of}} the two values are known, the number of {{elements}} {{greater than or equal to}} the first value and less than the second is the difference of the two ranks. This count can be adjusted up or down by one according to whether the endpoints of the range should be considered to be part of the range and whether <b>the</b> <b>array</b> contains keys matching those endpoints.|$|E

5|$|String {{inverters}} {{are substantially}} lower in capacity, {{of the order}} of 10kW, and condition the output of a single array string. This is normally a whole, or part of, a row of solar arrays within the overall plant.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>array</b> of a {{photovoltaic}} power system, or PV system, produces {{direct current}} (DC) power which fluctuates with the sunlight's intensity. For practical use this usually requires conversion to certain desired voltages or alternating current (AC), {{through the use}} of inverters. Multiple solar cells are connected inside modules. Modules are wired together to form arrays, then tied to an inverter, which produces power at the desired voltage, and for AC, the desired frequency/phase.|$|E
5|$|Three PASDE canisters, located {{throughout}} the cargo bay, also photogrammetrically recorded structural response {{data of the}} Mir solar arrays during the docked phase of the mission.

5|$|A {{new round}} of {{concession}} applications were filed in 1987: Trondheim to Northern Norway, Tromsø–Longyearbyen, Oslo–Billund and Oslo–Alicante. The right-winged Willoch's Second Cabinet decided to use three principles in issuing new concessions: keeping <b>the</b> <b>array</b> of local routes, granting concessions on the terms that the airlines would continue to cross-subsidize routes, and to introduce competition on the largest routes. Braathens SAFE was given permission to fly Oslo–Bergen and Western Norway – Trondheim – Bodø – Tromsø, plus once daily Oslo–Trondheim–Bodø, as well as Tromsø–Longyearbyen. At the same time, SAS was allowed to fly freely on the routes Oslo–Trondheim and Oslo–Stavanger. In 1988, Braathens SAFE introduced automatic check-in machines in Oslo, Stavanger, Bergen, Ålesund and Trondheim.|$|E
5|$|Commander T'Pol and Commander Tucker remain captives of Paxton, who {{continues}} to broadcast his demand on all channels and frequencies.

On Mars, Paxton allows T'Pol and Tucker see the baby, and T'Pol uses her scanner to learn that the child is unwell (and that Paxton has been using Rigelian gene therapy to treat himself). Seeking to fine-tune their attack, Paxton then threatens T'Pol to force Tucker to optimize the targeting system of <b>the</b> <b>array.</b>|$|E
5|$|Early radio {{telescope}} interferometers used a single baseline for measurement. Later astronomical interferometers, {{such as the}} Very Large Array illustrated in Fig11, used arrays of telescopes arranged in a pattern on the ground. A limited number of baselines will result in insufficient coverage. This was alleviated by using {{the rotation of the}} Earth to rotate <b>the</b> <b>array</b> relative to the sky. Thus, a single baseline could measure information in multiple orientations by taking repeated measurements, a technique called Earth-rotation synthesis. Baselines thousands of kilometers long were achieved using very long baseline interferometry.|$|E

5|$|In {{computer}} science, binary search, {{also known}} as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds {{the position of a}} target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in <b>the</b> <b>array.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} iterations, no search {{algorithm}} that works only by comparing elements can exhibit better average and worst case performance than binary search. This {{is because the}} comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as each level is filled completely with nodes if there are enough. Otherwise, the search algorithm can eliminate few elements in an iteration, {{increasing the number of}} iterations required in the average and worst case. This is the case for other search algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some target values, the average performance over all elements is affected. This problem is solved by binary search, as dividing <b>the</b> <b>array</b> in half ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{kinematic}} {{properties of}} {{an array of}} transmitting antennas that are transiently excited by a sequence of modulated pulses, with high repetition rate, are explored. <b>The</b> <b>array’s</b> parameterization is carried out via the energy radiation pattern. It is shown that the energy radiation pattern can be decomposed into a set {{of different types of}} beam contributions, defined over a beam-skeleton, which is determined by <b>the</b> <b>array’s</b> physical and excitation parameters. The different types of beams are main beams, grating-lobe beams and cross-pulsed lobe beams, each corresponding to a different pulsed interference mechanism. While grating lobes are time-harmonic phenomena, cross-pulsed lobes are unique for excitation with a pulsed sequence. The different beam types set limits for array sparsity in terms of <b>the</b> <b>array’s</b> physical and excitation parameters. <b>The</b> <b>array’s</b> directivity is introduced as a figure of merit of its performance and to demonstrate the resulting effect of the time-domain excitation characteristics. <b>The</b> <b>array’s</b> parameterization can be used with any type of excitation — from extreme narrow band (time-harmonic) to extreme ultra-wideband (transient/short pulsed) excitation. For time-harmonic excitation, the resulting characterization matches that of the classical frequency domain antenna theory. 1...|$|R
