500|$|Many years later, {{another of}} his followers, Virginia Downsborough, {{recalled}} that during the mid-1960s he [...] "talked a lot about Sara Northrup and seemed to want <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> knew he had never married her. I didn't know {{why it was so}} important to him; I'd never met Sara and I couldn't have cared less, but he wanted to persuade me that the marriage had never taken place. When he talked about his first wife, the picture he put out of himself was of this poor wounded fellow coming home from the war and being abandoned by his wife and family because he would be a drain on them." [...] As Downsborough put it, he portrayed himself as [...] "a constant victim of women".|$|E
500|$|Solo {{played in}} 22 WPS matches in 2010 {{for both the}} Athletica and the Beat and was the league-leader in saves with 104. The two-time WPS All-Star also ranked among the top three in shutouts (6), wins (6), and goals against average (1.64). After {{the end of the}} 2010 season, Solo {{underwent}} surgery on her right shoulder on September 22. [...] "These next two years are huge for the national team with the World Cup and Olympics on the horizon and I wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would be giving my team and my country my best on the field," [...] Solo said of the surgery. [...] "I've been having some painful issues with the shoulder for a while and for a goalkeeper it's been difficult physically and mentally to play with this kind of an injury, so {{it was time to get}} it taken care of." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, Rap-Up {{originally}} {{reported the}} song as [...] "Turn Off", while Hilson was playing it at Interscope-Geffen-A Records' second annual [...] "Creme of the Crop" [...] post-BET Awards dinner on June 25, 2008. Then an unmastered version of [...] "Turn Off" [...] was leaked online in September 2008. After selecting the predominantly pop-sounding [...] "Energy" [...] and [...] "Return the Favor", Hilson selected [...] "Turnin Me On" [...] as In a Perfect World...s third single. When asked {{in an interview}} with That Grape Juice if choosing the song was a conscious effort, since the song had a different sound than the previous singles, Hilson responded, [...] "Absolutely! I mean, there’s another side of me. I’m from Decatur, Georgia and that is a predominantly black neighbourhood with a lot of lower-class and some middle-class neighbourhoods. I guess that is the song that probably properly describes the type of girl I am, in relation to where I’m from. So yeah, it was definitely a conscious effort <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> stay close to home on some records." ...|$|E

500|$|One of Bridget's first {{high-profile}} storylines was {{coping with}} a disability, after Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) hit Bridget with her car. She had been paralysed {{on one side of}} her body, the storyline saw her trying to regain the complete use of her body. Mignon explained during an interview with media reporting website Last Broadcast, the research that had been carried out and the effects on the character stating: [...] "Bridget suffers extreme physical difficulties as a result, because she's such a sporty tomboy, to be incapacitated suddenly poses emotional problems for her. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could understand better what Bridget's going through, I studied medical notes on paralysis and disability on the internet." [...] The storyline also explored self-image issues that come with disabilities, in one episode Bridget was doing physiotherapy exercises and became in danger of drowning until Declan Napier (James Sorensen) saved her. He tried to kiss her but she fended off his advances, of this Mignon said: [...] "Bridget pushes him off, she fears he'll see her differently due to her disability." ...|$|E
500|$|The French {{electronic}} group Daft Punk {{composed the}} film score of Tron: Legacy, which features over 30 tracks. The score was arranged and orchestrated by Joseph Trapanese. Jason Bentley {{served as the}} film's music supervisor. An electronic music fan, Kosinski stated that to replicate the innovative electronic Tron score by Wendy Carlos [...] "rather than going with a traditional film composer, I wanted to try something fresh and different", adding that [...] "there {{was a lot of}} interest from different electronic bands that I follow to work on the film" [...] but he eventually picked Daft Punk. Kosinski added that he knew the band was [...] "more than just dance music guys" [...] for side projects such as [...] their film Electroma. The duo were first contacted by producers in 2007, when Tron: Legacy was still {{in the early stages of}} production. Since they were touring at the time, producers were unsuccessful in contacting the group. They were again approached by Kosinski, eventually agreeing to take part in the film a year later. Kosinski added that Daft Punk were huge Tron fans, and that his meeting with them [...] "was almost like they were interviewing me <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going to hold up to the Tron legacy".|$|E
2500|$|In interviews, Foster rarely {{talks about}} her private life, and she has {{explained}} that she [...] "values privacy against all else" [...] due to having {{spent most of her}} life in the public eye. She lives in Los Angeles, and had two sons, Charles [...] "Charlie" [...] Foster (b. 1998) and Christopher [...] "Kit" [...] Foster (b. 2001), while partnered with Cydney Bernard. She met Bernard on the set of Sommersby (1993) and was in a relationship with her from 1993 to 2008. In April 2014, Foster married actress and photographer Alexandra Hedison. She stated in 2011 that having children has made her take on fewer projects: [...] "It is a big sacrifice to leave home. I want <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel passionate about the movies I do because it is a big sacrifice... Even if you take the average movie shoot of four months – you have three weeks' prep, press duties here and abroad, dubbing and looping, magazine covers, events and premieres – that's eight months out of a year. That's a long time. If you do two movies back-to-back, you're never going to see your children." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several {{months later}} in July {{of the same}} year, it was {{revealed}} that Ciara would be reuniting with L.A. Reid by signing to his Epic Records label. Reid had previously signed Ciara to LaFace at the start of her career, and played a role in executively producing her debut album Goodies (2004). Billboard magazine officially confirmed Ciara's signing to Epic in September 2011. During an interview with Sway in the Morning in February 2012, Ciara revealed that she would be taking her time recording her fifth studio album. In June 2012, Ciara spoke about the album saying [...] "It really is just me pouring my heart into the record, and I think my fans deserve that. I really had to be in a comfortable place, and I really am and I'm excited about it, that's the beauty of music. Music is like really being able to express yourself. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> expressed myself in the best way that I could, and I let the music also be a healing process for me at points. There's a lot of happy moments as well, so that's what it's about. That's music. You laugh, you cry, you dance, you love, you hurt, you feel all kinds of things. That's the beauty of music." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{preparation}} she did for the film, actor Aishwarya Rai {{said in an interview}} that both herself and the director Bhansali [...] ".. just like to walk randomly around the sets and [...] "feel". Sometimes I sit quietly and gaze into space or the ground and he captures all that. In fact, the poster picture with me looking away was taken like that. I was looking at the ground, lost in deep thought and he clicked it and told me that he was putting it on his poster. He knows when I am ready to do a scene, when I am in character, and the like. For instance, I delayed going on the set by two days and he did not say anything. He called me on the set and said we would start shooting in five days. On the second day, I tried hair, make-up, and costume. He told me I was ready to give my first shot and indeed, I was." [...] About the script Bhansali said that he had worked on the script for 18 months and says, [...] "My film is mainstream in terms of budgets, cast and audience and I had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did not hurt anyone but evoked a debate." [...] He points out that without star-clout, such themes will not make any impact on the audience or society. [...] "And at least till my screenplay reaches the interval point, I do not start casting my actors." ...|$|E
