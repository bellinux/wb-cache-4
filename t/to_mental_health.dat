5|$|By 1912, Sadler and his wife, both doctors by then, {{operated}} a joint practice in Chicago that catered to children's and women's health issues. Sadler initially focused on surgery, performing surgeries with his wife, but widened his practice to include psychiatric counseling in 1930 {{and became a}} consulting psychiatrist at Columbus Hospital. As a psychiatrist, Sadler advocated {{an eclectic mix of}} techniques, applying the theories of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, and Adolf Meyer. Sadler believed that religious faith was beneficial <b>to</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health,</b> and specifically promoted prayer, which he believed to be most effective in the context of Christian faith. However, he thought that religious beliefs were deleterious <b>to</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> if based on fear.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{movements}} {{among the general}} self-harm community to make self-harm itself and treatment better known <b>to</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> professionals, {{as well as the}} general public. For example, March 1 is designated as Self-injury Awareness Day (SIAD) around the world. On this day, some people choose to be more open about their own self-harm, and awareness organizations make special efforts to raise awareness about self-harm. Some people wear an orange awareness ribbon or wristband to encourage awareness of self-harm.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June, and in {{response}} to a question from Fianna Fáil's James Browne about government spending on mental health, McEntee told the Dáil the government was committed to an annual increase in funding; Browne had noted that in 2014, €20 million had been allocated <b>to</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services rather than the promised €35 million, but McEntee said that €35 million had been ringfenced for 2016 and 2017. Along with Minister for Health Simon Harris, McEntee argued for the restoration of €12 million originally ringfenced for mental health spending that had been diverted to other areas. On 8 June, and as part of a €480m bailout package for health, the government announced that the mental health funding would be restored. Welcoming the decision, McEntee said the money would be used for staff recruitment and to improve services for homeless people, as well as developing perinatal mental health services.|$|E

40|$|Examining the {{importance}} of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care in assisted living (AL) settings, the present study examines older AL residents’ willingness <b>to</b> use <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services and its predictors. Data based on face-to-face interviews with 150 older residents from 17 AL settings in Florida {{are used in the}} analyses (Mage = 82. 8, SD = 9. 4). Multivariate logistic regression is used to estimate the likelihood of willingness <b>to</b> use <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services in relation to predisposing (demographics and physical <b>health),</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> needs (depressive symptoms), and enabling variables (social network, instrumental support, emotional support, informational support, satisfaction with support, and previous use of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services). Willingness <b>to</b> use <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services is predicted by younger age, unmarried status, lower levels of emotional support, and higher levels of informational support. The relationship of informational support to higher willingness <b>to</b> use <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services suggests that AL residents could benefit from educational interventions on late life depression...|$|R

Transgender and gender-variant individuals have been found to experience higher rates of mental health disparity than LGB individuals. According to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, for example, 39% of respondents reported serious psychological distress, compared to 5% of the general population.|$|E

40|$|Young {{adults and}} {{adolescents}} {{tend to be}} among the least likely <b>to</b> seek <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services even when they may benefit from them. This is particularly concerning since most psychological disorders have the highest incidence during this period of development. Researchers have proposed a number of variables that may act as barriers to help seeking including attitudes toward seeking <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services, <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> literacy, and symptoms of psychological distress. However, much of this research has focused only on correlations among attitudes, symptoms, and help seeking intentions. Furthermore, the assessment of readiness <b>to</b> seek <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services has been inconsistent across studies. The present study has extended this line of research by including <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> literacy in the analyses as well as applying the transtheoretical model framework to readiness <b>to</b> seek <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services prior <b>to</b> beginning treatment. 363 undergraduates completed online surveys which included demographic information as well as measures of psychological symptoms, <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> literacy, attitudes toward seeking <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services, and stage of readiness <b>to</b> seek <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services. Results suggest that attitudes and symptoms of psychological distress significantly influence readiness <b>to</b> seek <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services in this sample. This study highlights the need for research examining interventions for young adults that focus on changing attitudes and informing people about the effectiveness of psychological services in treating <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> issues. The need for additional research on <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> literacy is also discussed. ...|$|R

25|$|Transgender youth {{experience}} {{a wide range}} of abuse and lack of understanding from the people in their environment and are better off with a high resilience to deal with their lives. A study was done looking at 55 transgender youths studying their sense of personal mastery, perceived social support, emotion-oriented coping and self-esteem. It was seen that around 50% of the variation in the resilience aspects accounted for the problematic issues of the teens. This means that transgender youths with lower resilience were more prone <b>to</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> issues, including depression and trauma symptoms. Emotion-oriented coping was a strong aspect of resilience in determining how depressed the individuals were.|$|E

He noted that religious codes and religious individuals often manifest religiosity, but added that devout, demanding religiosity is also obvious among many orthodox psychotherapists and psychoanalysts, devout political believers and aggressive atheists.|$|E
