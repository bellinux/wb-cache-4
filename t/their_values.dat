5|$|Before {{coming to}} Cambridge, Burhop had {{not engaged in}} {{political}} activities. At Cambridge he encountered political debate generated by the suffering caused by the Great Depression {{and the rise of}} fascism in Europe. While he rejected his parents' faith in favour of rationalist science, he did not reject <b>their</b> <b>values,</b> especially that of compassion for others, and there was no estrangement between them. At Cambridge he embraced socialism, and believed that scientists had a moral responsibility to society, one that included fighting fascism.|$|E
5|$|Millions {{of years}} ago, creatures known as Sarnathians ruled the Earth, {{centring}} <b>their</b> <b>values</b> on torture of other creatures that {{were opposed to}} their rule. Their aim was to rule the universe using a mysterious orb that granted them great power. Thousands of years later, the orb became too powerful and eventually caused a tear in the inter-dimensional fabric of the Realm of Reality and the Realm of Unreality, thus rendering the Sarnathians extinct.|$|E

50|$|Most {{probably}} {{the reason was}} that his real interest was in the overall dynamics of capital accumulation, competition, and the realisation of surplus value produced, assuming output would sell. He was thinking of grand averages and overall results. The simplified picture does not obtain in reality, among other things because, as Marx himself notes, capitalist competition turns on buying commodities below <b>their</b> <b>value</b> and selling them above <b>their</b> <b>value</b> (or, in the ideal competitive situation, to sell them below <b>their</b> <b>value</b> at a good profit, with a high turnover).|$|R

5|$|Various {{authors have}} {{proposed}} slightly different {{analyses of the}} Khmer vowel system.

The number of vowel nuclei and <b>their</b> <b>values</b> vary between dialects; differences exist even between the Standard Khmer system and that of the Battambang dialect on which the standard is based.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's parent company, Arsenal Holdings plc, {{operates}} as a non-quoted public limited company, whose ownership is considerably {{different from that of}} other football clubs. Only 62,219 shares in Arsenal have been issued, and they are not traded on a public exchange such as the FTSE or AIM; instead, they are traded relatively infrequently on the ICAP Securities and Derivatives Exchange, a specialist market. On 29 May 2017, a single share in Arsenal had a mid price of £18,000, which sets the club's market capitalisation value at approximately £1,119.9m. Most football clubs aren't listed on an exchange, which makes direct comparisons of <b>their</b> <b>values</b> difficult. Consultants Brand Finance valued the club's brand and intangible assets at $703m in 2015, and consider Arsenal an AAA global brand. Business magazine Forbes valued Arsenal as a whole at $2.0 billion (£1.4 billion) in 2016, ranked second in English football. Research by the Henley Business School also ranked Arsenal second in English football, modelling the club's value at £1.118 billion in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenge}} with Kibble balances {{is not only}} in reducing their uncertainty, but also in making them truly practical realizations of the kilogram. Nearly every aspect of Kibble balances and their support equipment requires such extraordinarily precise and accurate, state-of-the-art technology that—unlike a device like an atomic clock—few countries would currently choose to fund their operation. For instance, the NIST's Kibble balance used four resistance standards in 2007, each of which was rotated through the Kibble balance every two to six weeks after being calibrated in {{a different part of}} NIST headquarters facility in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It was found that simply moving the resistance standards {{down the hall to the}} Kibble balance after calibration altered <b>their</b> <b>values</b> 10ppb (equivalent to 10µg) or more. Present-day technology is insufficient to permit stable operation of Kibble balances between even biannual calibrations. If the kilogram is defined in terms of the Planck constant, it is likely there will only be a few—at most—Kibble balances initially operating in the world.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{analysis}} of capitalist competition offered in Marx's Capital, Volume III is completely {{based on the principle}} that commodities, human labor capacity, currencies and assets (physical or financial) in reality do not trade at <b>their</b> <b>value.</b> Rather, they are constantly being traded at margins above <b>their</b> <b>value</b> and below <b>their</b> <b>value,</b> in markets where sales are constantly fluctuating. It is, as Marx explains in the first chapter of Capital, Volume III, precisely the difference between the necessary cost-prices and the possible selling prices of commodities which is critical for profit margins, and which is therefore at the epicenter of competition in product markets. Commodities could be sold below <b>their</b> <b>value,</b> at a good profit, assuming a sufficient turnover – the classical principle of competition. Moreover, the further development of {{the analysis}} in Capital, Volume III shows that goods and assets are also being traded for profit external to the sphere of production.|$|R

In this paper, we perform a large scale study of the usefulness of bookmarked URLs from the top social bookmarking site Delicious. Instead of focusing on the dimension of tags, which has been covered in the previous work, we explore social bookmarking from the dimension of URLs. More specifically, we investigate the Delicious URLs and their content to quantify <b>their</b> <b>value</b> to a search engine. For <b>their</b> <b>value</b> in leading to good content, we show that the Delicious URLs have higher quality content and more external outlinks. For <b>their</b> <b>value</b> in satisfying users, we show that the Delicious URLs have more clicked URLs as well as get more clicks. We suggest that based on <b>their</b> <b>value,</b> the Delicious URLs should be used as another source of seed URLs for crawlers...|$|R
