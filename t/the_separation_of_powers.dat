50|$|In July 2007, the Court of Appeal {{held that}} <b>the</b> {{doctrine}} <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> {{was an integral}} part of the Constitution; under the Westminster System Malaysia inherited from <b>the</b> British, <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> was originally only loosely provided for. This decision was however overturned by the Federal Court, which held that <b>the</b> doctrine <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> is a political doctrine, coined by the French political thinker Baron de Montesquieu, under which the legislative, executive and judicial branches of the government are kept entirely separate and distinct and that the Federal Constitution does have some features of this doctrine but not always (for example, Malaysian Ministers are both executives and legislators, which is inconsistent with <b>the</b> doctrine <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers).</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts. It delineates certain issues which fall beyond the purview of judicial review because those matters are unsuited for adjudication, {{due to the nature}} of the litigation process and judicial expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of <b>the</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E

5|$|At present, Romania {{is divided}} into 41 {{counties}} and one municipality (Bucharest); these are assigned as the NUTS-3 geocode statistical subdivision scheme of Romania within the European Union. Each of the counties is further divided into cities (some of which have municipality status) and communes. The prefect and his administration have executive prerogatives within the county limits, while limited legislative powers are assigned to a County Council elected every four years during local elections. The territorial districts of the Romanian judicial system overlap with county borders, thus avoiding further complication in <b>the</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> on the government.|$|E
5|$|The four judges {{then went}} on to decide that the {{jurisdiction}} involved an exercise of judicial power, mentioning an earlier decision of Justice Isaacs, in which he had taken a functional approach, and determined that some functions, when conferred upon a legislative or executive body, can involve the exercise of non-judicial power, but the same functions when conferred on a judicial body involve the exercise of judicial power. The four judges found that the powers conferred on the court, to take evidence and compel witnesses and such, when vested in a judicial body such as the court, involved the exercise of judicial power. As such, the jurisdiction did not offend <b>the</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Academics have {{expressed}} scepticism {{as to whether}} the doctrine of legitimate expectation should apply to substantive rights. Thio Li-ann argues that legitimate expectations should relate only to procedural rather than substantive rights. Procedural protection only has a minimal impact on the administrative autonomy of the relevant public authority, since the court is only concerned with {{the manner in which the}} decision was made and not whether the decision was fair. Thus, the ultimate autonomy of public authorities is never placed in jeopardy. Conversely, as Mark Elliot posits, giving effect to a substantive legitimate expectation impinges on <b>the</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers.</b> The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about the allocation of resources in public interest. Applying legitimate expectation substantively allows the courts to inquire into the merits of the decision. Such interference with the public authority's discretion would be overstepping their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function.|$|E

5|$|On December 29, 2014, Bank Markazi filed a {{petition}} for certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States, requesting the Court {{to consider the}} question: Does §8772 violate <b>the</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> by purporting {{to change the law}} for, and directing a particular result in, a single pending case? The certiorari petition was circulated to the Justices for their conference on April 3, 2015, after a brief by the respondents (Peterson) opposing certiorari and a reply brief from the petitioner (Bank Markazi) were filed in March. Following the April 3rd conference, the Court called for the Solicitor General to file a brief expressing the views of the federal government, which was filed on August 19. In May and June, the Supreme Court meets only to issue orders and opinions and does not hear oral arguments until the next term begins. The Court granted certiorari following its conference on September 28.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the signing}} of the treaty, Tyler {{complied}} with the Texans' demand for military and naval protection, deploying troops to Fort Jesup in Louisiana and a fleet of warships to the Gulf of Mexico. In the event that the Senate failed to pass the treaty, Tyler promised the Texas diplomats that he would officially exhort both houses of Congress to establish Texas as a state of the Union upon provisions authorized in the Constitution. Tyler's cabinet was split on the administration's handling of the Texas agreement. Secretary of War William Wilkins praised the terms of annexation publicly, touting the economic and geostrategic benefits with relation to Great Britain. Secretary of the Treasury John C. Spencer was alarmed at the constitutional implications of Tyler's application of military force without congressional approval, a violation of <b>the</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers.</b> Refusing to transfer contingency funds for the naval mobilization, he resigned.|$|E
5|$|In June 1783, a {{different}} group of disgruntled soldiers from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, sent Congress a petition demanding their back pay. When {{they began to}} march toward Philadelphia, Congress charged Hamilton and two others with intercepting the mob. Hamilton requested militia from Pennsylvania's Supreme Executive Council, but was turned down. Hamilton instructed Assistant Secretary of War William Jackson to intercept the men. Jackson was unsuccessful. The mob arrived in Philadelphia, and the soldiers proceeded to harangue Congress for their pay. The President of the Continental Congress, John Dickinson, feared that the Pennsylvania state militia was unreliable, and refused its help. Hamilton argued that Congress ought to adjourn to Princeton, New Jersey. Congress agreed, and relocated there. Frustrated with {{the weakness of the}} central government, Hamilton while in Princeton drafted a call to revise the Articles of Confederation. This resolution contained many features of the future U.S. Constitution, including a strong federal government with the ability to collect taxes and raise an army. It also included <b>the</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> into the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches.|$|E

5|$|On 25 January 1989, the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989 and the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 {{were passed}} by Parliament {{to confirm the}} {{applicability}} of the subjective test laid down in Lee Mau Seng as the law governing judicial review of the executive's discretionary powers under the ISA. These Acts came into force on 27 and 30 January 1989 respectively. Speaking during the Second Reading of the constitutional amendment bill, Minister for Law S. Jayakumar said the Government was taking this step because it was of the view that the courts' application of an objective test would amount to judicial usurpation of the executive's functions in matters pertaining to national security, which the judiciary is ill-equipped to deal with. Its stance was that the objective test would empower the courts to substitute their views on the proper exercise of discretionary power conferred under the ISA for that of the executive in contravention of <b>the</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> doctrine. Moreover, the judicial process, unlike executive decision-making, was not conducive to a swift response to national security threats. The courts, unlike the executive, lacked access to inadmissible evidence relevant to security matters, and judges did not possess the skill and knowledge of the security experts employed by the executive. Furthermore, the objective test did not find favour with the Government because it had been imported from the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth jurisdictions. Since the objective test had been formulated by foreign judges without consideration of Singapore's local conditions, the Government was averse to the idea of allowing the objective test to shape the development of Singapore law on matters of national security under the ISA.|$|E
5|$|The House of Lords' {{statement}} on parliamentary privilege {{was assessed by}} the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, which recommended that Parliament not counter the decision in Pepper v Hart, but cautioned that this should not lead to any further weakening of parliamentary privilege. However, academics widely condemned the decision and the thinking behind it. Academic Aileen Kavanagh questioned the logic used; the House of Lords was essentially saying that, where a minister has made a statement about an act's intent that was not questioned by Parliament, that statement {{can be used as}} evidence. However, there are many reasons why Members of Parliament might not question a statement, and this does not necessarily indicate that they approve of it; {{in the case of the}} Finance Act, for example, it could simply be that as the statement was not going to be added to the statute, they found no reason to actively oppose it. At the same time, different Members of Parliament may approve of a statutory provision for different reasons. The fact that a minister gives certain reasons for including a provision does not necessarily indicate that Parliament agrees; only that Parliament also feels, for whatever reason, that the provision should be included. The decision also raises questions about <b>the</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> in the United Kingdom; it has been consistently maintained that it is Parliament, not the executive, which passes legislation. If one accepts that statements by the executive can allow them to specify the meaning of particular laws without formally including them in statutes where they can be approved by Parliament, it violates this separation of powers, allowing the executive to make law.|$|E
5|$|Bank Markazi v. Peterson, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a United States Supreme Court {{case that}} found that a law which only applied to a {{specific}} case, identified by docket number, and eliminated all of the defenses one party had raised does not violate <b>the</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> in the United States Constitution between the legislative (Congress) and judicial branches of government. The plaintiffs in the trial court, respondents in the Supreme Court, were several parties who had obtained judgments against Iran for its role in supporting state-sponsored terrorism, particularly the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings and 1996 Khobar Towers bombing, and sought execution against a bank account in New York held, through European intermediaries, on behalf of Bank Markazi, the state-owned Central Bank of Iran. The initial plaintiffs obtained court orders preventing the transfer of funds from the account in 2008 and initiated their lawsuit in 2010. Bank Markazi raised several defenses against the execution against the account, including that the account was not an asset of the bank, but rather an asset of its European intermediary, under both New York state property law and §201(a) of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. In response to concerns that existing laws were insufficient for the account {{to be used to}} settle the judgments, Congress included a section within a 2012 bill, codified after enactment as 22 U.S.C. §8772, that identified the pending lawsuit by docket number, applied only to the assets in the identified case, and essentially abrogated every legal basis available to Bank Markazi to prevent the plaintiffs from executing their claims against the account. Bank Markazi then argued that §8772 was an unconstitutional breach of the separation of power between the legislative and judicial branches of government, because it effectively directed a particular result in a single case without changing the generally applicable law. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and, on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit both upheld the constitutionality of §8772 and cleared the way for the plaintiffs to execute their judgments against the account, which held about $1.75billion in cash.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to systematize {{points of}} view {{concerning}} <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> harmonizing <b>the</b> outcomes of the Administrative State with the Legislative Power. Methodology/approach/design – It analyzes and re-examines <b>the</b> classical theory <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers,</b> especially Montesquieu’s, liberal hue, {{in the context of}} the Welfare State and the exercise of regulatory function – administration of law – from the independent establishments to adjust it in today’s state structure. Findings – The Administrative State, responsible for the regulatory function, does not violate <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> nor invade <b>the</b> attributions <b>of</b> the Legislative <b>Power,</b> given that they operate exactly under the of public policy goals set forth by the legislator. Practical implications – Away form the common claim that the Administrative State violates <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> by invading <b>the</b> Legislative Power competencies, independent establishments are strengthened and gain legitimacy in the exercise of their objectives. Originality/value – This paper has focuses on points of intersection between different views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers,</b> uniting them on the purpose of harmonizing the outcomes of the Administrative State with Legislative Power competencies...|$|R
