5|$|Dunderdale was the Progressive Conservative Candidate in the {{district}} of Fortune-Hermitage in the 1993 provincial election. Dunderdale ran against Liberal cabinet minister Oliver Langdon, and while she knew she would not win the election she felt she had to send premier Clyde Wells a message about <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> treating municipalities. In the 1995 Progressive Conservative leadership election Dunderdale served as co-chair of Lynn Verge's successful campaign.|$|E
5|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpsons's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. As the race closed in on the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture, and for a while, Simpson managed {{to stay in the}} front group of elite riders. He then slipped back to a group of chasers around one minute behind before he began to lose control of his bike and zig-zag across the road. His team manager, Alec Taylor, feared for Simpson less for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going up the mountain than for the way he would go down the other side.|$|E

5|$|Following their victory, Li Yuan and {{his army}} {{continued}} their southward advance, and in mid-October reached the Yellow River. Part {{of the army}} was left behind to contain the Sui garrison at Puzhou, while the rest crossed the river, defeating a Sui army that tried to stop them. The governor of Huazhou surrendered {{the city and its}} vital granaries to him, and Li Yuan turned towards the capital. On <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> joined by his daughter, Princess Pingyang, and his cousin, Li Shentong, with the troops they had raised themselves. By the time Li Yuan's army reached Daxingcheng, it was said to number 200,000 men. After a brief siege, on 9 November, Li Yuan's troops stormed the capital.|$|E
5|$|Konnan was {{inactive}} throughout early 2000, as he {{was suspended}} for three months by Bill Busch after requesting his release from WCW, unhappy with <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> being used. Shortly after returning from suspension and reforming the Filthy Animals, Konnan was sidelined once again, {{this time with a}} legitimately torn triceps muscle, damaged when Van Hammer threw Juventud Guerrera at him during a match and Guerrera's elbow connected with Konnan's upper arm as he attempted to catch him. Throughout 2000, the Filthy Animals feuded with other stables, including The Misfits In Action, The Natural Born Thrillers and Team Canada. At WCW's final pay-per-view event, Greed on March 18, 2001, Lance Storm and Mike Awesome (representing Team Canada) defeated Hugh Morrus and Konnan. WCW was sold to WWE five days later, on March 23.|$|E
5|$|The 1973–74 season saw {{the arrival}} of a new player in Johan Cruyff, who was bought for a world record £920,000 from Ajax. Already an {{established}} player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son Jordi, after the local Catalan Saint George. Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the 1973–74 season {{for the first time since}} 1960, defeating Real Madrid 5–0 at the Santiago Bernabéu along <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971).

5|$|The Athenian expedition, led by Mantias, still {{landed at}} Methone on the Macedonian coast, with 3,000 {{mercenary}} troops. Mantias now declined to leave Methone, so Argeus instead led the {{troops to the}} ancient Macedonian capital of Aegae, hoping that the populace would declare him king. However, the people of Aegae showed no interest in doing so, and Argeus therefore marched back to Methone. On <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> attacked and defeated in battle by Philip, many of the Athenian mercenaries being slain and the rest taken captive. According to Diodorus, this victory did much to restore {{the morale of the}} Macedonian army, and gave the soldiers encouragement for the battles to come.|$|E

His home town of Rouen organises commemorations but, me, I haven't forgotten {{that it was in}} Antwerp that he made his farewell appearance. More than once, I saw him crying in his hotel room after suffering the spitting and insults of spectators. People said he was cold, a calculator, a dilettante. The truth is that Jacques was a monster of courage. In the mountains, he suffered as though he was damned. He wasn't a climber.

25|$|Bob Markham (Mark Harmon) - A logger, widower, {{and single}} father to his {{daughter}} Abby. After his wife died, he sunk everything he had into logging. However, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> logging tore up so much soil, that a long dormant plague was released and threatened to kill his men, and daughter. With help from Tarzan and Terk, Markham gathered {{all but one of}} the ingredients for the cure. The last one was a flower that was only found in one part of the jungle, until Markham's men bulldozed over them while logging. By some luck, Abby had picked one of them before, and Jane showed her how to press it, thus preserving it. After Abby and Markham's men were cured, they ceased logging and started to plant the seeds saved from the flower.|$|E
25|$|On November 14, 2006, Mostafa Tabatabainejad, a fourth-year University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) student, was drive stunned {{multiple}} {{times with a}} Taser by campus police, for allegedly refusing to show his school ID to a fellow student acting as security at the college library Instructional Computing Commons (CLICC) lab at Powell Library during finals week. The police had been called after Tabatabainejad had refused to provide his BruinCard (student ID) to a UCLA Community Service Officer (aka student volunteer). Tabatabainejad felt he was being singled out because of his Middle Eastern ethnicity. A UCLA ID card with magnetic strip is needed {{to enter into the}} Library after hours and therefore it was assumed that all individuals in the library were students and had valid ID cards to gain access. Asking students to show ID was not a common practice and for this reason the student refused to show his ID and instead asked the community officer if he had asked anyone else that evening to show their ID. The community officer threatened to call campus police if he didn't show ID. Tabatabainejad, being confident the campus police would take his side as he felt he was being harassed, invited the community officer to do so. When the campus police arrived they did not ask questions but instead handcuffed Tabatabainejad and attempted to physically remove him from the Library. Tabatabainejad sat on the floor in protest of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> being treated at his own University while he was studying for final exams. The campus police then Tasered him five times while his hands were bound behind his back with plastic wrist restraints. Part of the incident was recorded on video by a camera phone and is available for viewing on YouTube.|$|E
