25|$|Until the Czech coup, the {{emphasis}} in Washington had been on economic containment of Communism, primarily through the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan and a heavy reliance on atomic power as a shield to support it. President Harry S. Truman understood that in 1946 and 1947 <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> not prepared for a massive conventional arms buildup or a confrontation with the Soviet Union. He was reluctant to increase the military budget dramatically and instead chose a gradual and balanced buildup. Expecting to spend large amounts on the Marshall Plan, he sought to keep the annual defence budget below $15billion.|$|E

There {{are a lot of}} difficult challenges right now in the United States... All of those decisions that the President has to make surrounding each one of these very difficult challenges are hard. They're hard decisions to make. And of course some people are unhappy about what some of those decisions are. But I think people know that he is doing what he thinks is right for the United States, that he's doing what he – especially in the war on terror, what he thinks he is obligated to do for the people in the United States, and that is to protect them... When his polls were really high they weren't on the front page." ...|$|E

500|$|Supporters of the Constitution, {{known as}} Federalists, opposed {{a bill of}} rights for much of the {{ratification}} period, in part due to the procedural uncertainties it would create. Madison argued against such an inclusion, suggesting that state governments were sufficient guarantors of personal liberty, in No. 46 of The Federalist Papers, a series of essays promoting the Federalist position. Hamilton opposed {{a bill of rights}} in The Federalist No. 84, stating that [...] "the constitution is itself in every rational sense, and to every useful purpose, a bill of rights. He stated that ratification did not mean <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> surrendering their rights, making protections unnecessary: [...] "Here, in strictness, the people surrender nothing, and as they retain everything, they have no need of particular reservations." [...] Patrick Henry criticized the federalist point of view, writing that the legislature must be firmly informed [...] "of the extent of the rights retained by the people ... being in a state of uncertainty, they will assume rather than give up powers by implication." [...] Other anti-federalists pointed out that earlier political documents, in particular the Magna Carta had protected specific rights. In response, Hamilton argued that the Constitution was inherently different: ...|$|E
2500|$|Although the US {{mission was}} irate over the {{reporting}} of the battle, even the U.S. Public Information Office (PIO) in Saigon had to admit, from partial information on an emotional subject, the reporting was [...] "two-thirds accurate" [...] and that the correspondents had done quite respectably. Ap Bac and the controversy surrounding it, however, marked a permanent divide in {{the relations between the}} official U.S. position and the news media in Vietnam. Before the battle, the media had criticized Diem and argued for [...] more U.S. control of the war, but they were still agreeable to the position of the diplomats and the U.S. military assistance command. After it, correspondents became steadily more convinced that they (and, by extension, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people)</b> <b>were</b> being lied to and withdrew, embittered, into their own community.|$|E

Roosevelt entered office with enormous political capital. Americans of all political persuasions were demanding immediate action, and Roosevelt responded with a remarkable series of new programs in the [...] "first hundred days" [...] of the administration, in which he met with Congress for 100 days. During those 100 days of lawmaking, Congress granted every request Roosevelt asked, and passed a few programs (such as the FDIC to insure bank accounts) that he opposed. Ever since, presidents have been judged against Franklin D. Roosevelt for what they accomplished in their first 100 days. Walter Lippmann famously noted: ...|$|E

2500|$|Carter {{was widely}} {{blamed for the}} return of the long gas lines in the summer of 1979 that were last seen just after the 1973 Yom Kippur War. He planned on {{delivering}} his fifth major speech on energy, but he felt that <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> no longer listening. Carter left for the presidential retreat of Camp David. [...] "For more than a week, a veil of secrecy enveloped the proceedings. Dozens of prominent Democratic Party leaders—members of Congress, governors, labor leaders, academics and clergy—were summoned to the mountaintop retreat to confer with the beleaguered president." [...] His pollster, Pat Caddell, told him that the American people simply faced a crisis of confidence because of the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr.; the Vietnam War; and Watergate. On July 15, 1979, Carter gave a nationally televised address in which he identified what he believed to be a [...] "crisis of confidence" [...] among the American people. This {{came to be known as}} his [...] "malaise" [...] speech, although Carter never used the word in the speech.|$|E
2500|$|For Frye, [...] "Gordred {{the giant}} leads a workers' {{revolution}} [...] the rebellion {{seems to be}} largely a middle class {{one in which the}} stronghold of political liberty is the independent yeoman." [...] David V. Erdman sees the poem as a direct antecedent of America and thus containing allusions to the American Revolution; England's actions prior to and during the war received widespread condemnation from the majority of the people, especially in London, where numerous protests were held against it. Blake was very much of the popular opinion that England was the oppressor and that <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> fighting a righteous battle for their freedom. Erdman argues that in 'Gwin', [...] "the geography is sufficiently obscure so that [...] "the nations of the North" [...] oppressed by King Gwin may easily be compared to the nations of North America oppressed by King George [...] In 'Gwin', the rising up of the oppressed behind the [...] "troubl'd banners" [...] of their deliverer [...] "Gordred the giant" [...] parallels the hope that some American champion would prove the Samson of the New World." [...] Erdman thus compares Gordred with George Washington and Thomas Paine. Susan J. Wolfson also sees the poem as primarily metaphorical; [...] "the revenge-tale enacted by two symbolic figures is less the ballad's point than the universal carnage that displaces all hope of political reform [...] this bloodbath may not so much pale politics into visionary history as evoke an appalling visionary politics, a transhistorical anxiety about the human cost of historical conflict." ...|$|E

6000|$|What are we {{to infer}} {{concerning}} the home habits of a nation of men who so resignedly allow their bodies to be poisoned and maltreated in traveling over such an extent of territory as is covered by our railroad lines? Does it not show that foul air and improper food are too much matters of course to excite attention? As a writer in [...] "The Nation" [...] has lately remarked, it is simply and only because the American nation like to have unventilated cars, and to be fed on pie and coffee at stopping-places, that nothing better is known to our travelers; {{if there were any}} marked dislike of such a state of things {{on the part of the}} people, it would not exist. We have wealth enough, and enterprise enough, and ingenuity enough, in our American nation, to compass with wonderful rapidity any end that really seems to us desirable. An army was improvised when an army was wanted,--and an army more perfectly equipped, more bountifully fed, than so great a body of men ever was before. Hospitals, Sanitary Commissions, and Christian Commissions all arose out of the simple conviction of the American people that they must arise. If <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> equally convinced that foul air was a poison,--that to have cold feet and hot heads was to invite an attack of illness,--that maple-sugar, popcorn, peppermint candy, pie, doughnuts, and peanuts are not diet for reasonable beings,--they would have railroad accommodations very different from those now in existence.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a hot}} day on the California coast. In {{the memory}} of the oldest American {{inhabitant}} its like had not been experienced, and although the testimony of the Spanish Californian was deemed untrustworthy where the interests of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> concerned, the statement that for sixty years there had been no such weather was accepted without question. The additional fact, vouchsafed by Don Pedro Peralta, that the great earthquake which shook down the walls of the Mission of San Juan Bautista had been preceded by a week of such abnormal meteorology, was promptly suppressed as being of a quality calculated to check immigration. Howbeit it was hot. The usual afternoon trade-winds had pretermitted their rapid, panting breath, and the whole coast lay, as it were, in the hush of death. The evening fogs that always had lapped the wind-abraded surfaces of the bleak seaward hills were gone too; the vast Pacific lay still and glassy, glittering, but intolerable. The outlying sand dunes, unmitigated by any breath of air, blistered the feet and faces of chance pedestrians. For once the broad verandahs, piazzas, and balconies of San Francisco cottage architecture were consistent and serviceable. People lingered upon them in shirt-sleeves, with all the exaggeration of a novel experience. French windows, that had always been barred against the fierce afternoon winds, were suddenly thrown open; that brisk, energetic step, with which the average San Franciscan hurried to business or pleasure, was changed to an idle, purposeless lounge. The saloons were crowded with thirsty multitudes, the quays and wharves with a people who had never before appreciated the tonic of salt air; the avenues leading over the burning sand-hills to the ocean all day were thronged with vehicles. The numerous streets and by-ways, abandoned by their great scavenger, the wind, were foul and ill-smelling. For twenty-four hours business was partly forgotten; as the heat continued and the wind withheld its customary tribute, there were some changes in the opinions and beliefs of the people; doubts were even expressed of the efficacy of the climate; a few heresies were uttered regarding business and social creeds, and Mr. Dumphy and certain other financial magnates felt vaguely that if the thermometer continued to advance the rates of interest must fall correspondingly.|$|E
