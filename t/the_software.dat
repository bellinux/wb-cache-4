5|$|By early February {{the program}} coding {{switched}} from legal pads to the PDP-10 and a preliminary version {{was completed by}} March 1975.

MITS needed more time to get a computer with 7k bytes of memory working, and they needed more time to get <b>the</b> <b>software</b> finished. When Allen arrived at MITS it took a day to get <b>the</b> <b>software</b> running; Allen remembers this being caused by computer memory problems while Roberts remembers the delay was due to software problems.|$|E
5|$|He {{started with}} a {{collection}} of seven basic statistics (assists, blocks, fouls, points, rebounds, steals, and turnovers) from Yahoo! Sports on every NBA player from the previous season and adjusted the stats for time in play. <b>The</b> <b>software</b> grouped the players into color-coded nodes and connected them with lines that represented statistical similarities. Alagappan had expected <b>the</b> <b>software</b> to create five groups of nodes by statistical advantages, which would each represent a position of play, but <b>the</b> <b>software</b> instead returned 13 node groups representing 13 mathematically described positions. The assignments compare player statistics and not individual style. Originally unconfident in his results, he explored the data on his own for a week before sharing his findings with his bosses and basketball statisticians including Ken Pomeroy, who replied in encouragement. He then applied and was accepted to speak at the 2012 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. By May 2012, at least four NBA teams and one MLB team had contacted Ayasdi about using their technology.|$|E
