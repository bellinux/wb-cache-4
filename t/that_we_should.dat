5|$|Prime Minister Stanley Bruce was a {{supporter}} of the White Australia Policy, and made it an issue in his campaign for the 1925 Australian Federal election.It is necessary <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> determine what are the ideals towards which every Australian would desire to strive. I think those ideals might well be stated as being to secure our national safety, and to ensure the maintenance of our White Australia Policy to continue as an integral portion of the British Empire. We intend to keep this country white and not allow its people to be faced with the problems that at present are practically insoluble {{in many parts of the}} world.|$|E
5|$|The third book {{continues}} along {{a similar}} vein, condemning cosmetics {{on the grounds}} that it is our souls, not our bodies, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> seek to beautify. Clement also opposes the dyeing of men's hair and male depilation as effeminacy. He advises choosing one's company carefully, to avoid being corrupted by immoral people, and while arguing that material wealth is no sin in itself, it is too likely to distract one from the infinitely more important spiritual wealth which is found in Christ. The work finishes with selections of scripture supporting Clement's argument, and following a prayer, the lyrics of a hymn.|$|E

5|$|The most {{frequently}} used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding {{the idea that there}} is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible. Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.|$|E
25|$|Hence {{to protect}} ourself from Kali, it is {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> start doing japa, meditation or any yoga like Bhakti yoga, karma yoga, Raja yoga, and jnana yoga. But, Chanting the holy name of God is the best path in Kali yuga.|$|E
25|$|It {{represented}} {{the change in}} the balance which was going on. There was the old countryman and the blocks of flats being knocked down. It was just a way of saying <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> look after the earth, not rape and pillage it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know, my {{dear old}} bear, that only this {{afternoon}} I was thinking <b>that,</b> perhaps, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not be married after all?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If it hadn't {{been for}} <b>that</b> storm <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have beaten her easily," [...] the captain said. [...] "But I don't mind losing that fiver, {{considering}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have gained four days on her." ...|$|R
25|$|Revelation has a {{wide variety}} of interpretations, ranging from the simple message <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have faith that God will prevail ("symbolic interpretation"), to complex end time {{scenarios}} ("futurist interpretation"), to the views of critics who deny any spiritual value to Revelation at all.|$|E
25|$|These {{form part}} of the coat of arms of the La Salle family of Rheims, France. There are three bent bars of {{inverted}} V shapes. Chevrons are symbols of firmness and constancy indicating <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have ZEAL in carrying out our tasks and the courage never to give up.|$|E
25|$|The long gestation, however, {{did give}} us {{time to plan}} an all-new edition. The {{publisher}} insisted <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> reorganize the game system into entirely new products. This was necessary to present the material to an entirely new generation of gamers in a more logical format (and to make dealers notice {{that it was a}} new edition).|$|E
2500|$|... <b>that</b> today <b>we</b> <b>should</b> {{observe the}} commandments (Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Avodah Zarah 3a, 4b); because {{we will not}} observe them {{in the world to}} come (Rashi) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir. No {{more than}} you have. But I expect if we could lay our hands upon <b>that</b> lady <b>we</b> <b>should</b> know more about Sir Charles's death." ...|$|R

25|$|In the New Testament, Jesus {{speaks of}} the {{importance}} of Christians forgiving or showing mercy towards others. Jesus used the parable of the unmerciful servant (Matthew 18:21-35) to say <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> forgive without limits. Parable of the Prodigal Son is perhaps the best known parable about forgiveness and refers to God's forgiveness for his people.|$|E
25|$|Augustine {{also does}} not {{envision}} original sin as causing structural changes in the universe, and even suggests that the bodies of Adam and Eve were already created mortal before the Fall. Apart from his specific views, Augustine recognizes that {{the interpretation of the}} creation story is difficult, and remarks <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be willing to change our mind about it as new information comes up.|$|E
25|$|Whether Adam is the personage <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> {{consider}} Our Heavenly Father, or not, {{is considerable}} {{of a mystery}} to a good many. I do not care for one moment how that is; it is no matter whether we are to consider Him our God, or whether His Father, or his Grandfather, for in either case we are of one species of one family and Jesus Christ is also of our species.|$|E

25|$|I {{really do}} not think <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have homosexuals guiding our children. I think that it’s a {{lifestyle}} that I don’t agree with. I realize {{a lot of people}} do. It’s my personal faith, religious faith, that I don’t believe that the people who do this should be raising our children. It’s not a natural thing. You need a mother and a father. You need a man and a woman. That’s what God intended.|$|E
25|$|The deontological {{argument}} against research on human beings is that persons are an ends in themselves. This means we cannot use people for any purpose. The deontological argument {{relies on the}} belief <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> treat others {{as we would like}} to be treated. If someone was suffering from a terminal illness and they were likely to die shortly, under deontological assumptions research could not be done on them even if it meant saving the lives of millions.|$|E
25|$|I {{hope the}} discussions {{outlined}} {{in these pages}} {{have shown that the}} data of anthropology teach us a greater tolerance of forms of civilization different from our own, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> learn to look on foreign races with greater sympathy and with a conviction that, as all races have contributed in the past to cultural progress in one way or another, so they will be capable of advancing the interests of mankind if we are only willing to give them a fair opportunity.|$|E

60|$|I {{consulted}} with the Vladika at once {{as to what}} was best to be done. And <b>we</b> decided <b>that,</b> though <b>we</b> <b>should</b> put a cordon of guards around it at a safe distance to prevent them receiving warning, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> at present make no attack.|$|R
25|$|My friend Clinch Smith {{made the}} {{proposition}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> leave and go toward the stern. But there arose before {{us from the}} decks below a mass of humanity several lines deep converging on the Boat Deck facing us and completely blocking our passage to the stern. There were women in the crowd {{as well as men}} and these seemed to be steerage passengers who had just come up from the decks below. Even among these people there was no hysterical cry, no evidence of panic. Oh the agony of it.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the pragmatic}} theories, {{such as those}} by Charles Peirce and William James, {{included}} aspects of correspondence, coherence and constructivist theories. Crispin Wright argued in his 1992 book Truth and Objectivity that any predicate which satisfied certain platitudes about truth qualified as a truth predicate. In some discourses, Wright argued, {{the role of the}} truth predicate might be played by the notion of superassertibility. Michael Lynch, in a 2009 book Truth as One and Many, argued <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> see truth as a functional property capable of being multiply manifested in distinct properties like correspondence or coherence.|$|E
25|$|The way Kant {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> {{deal with}} this dialectic is through {{an appeal to the}} two perspectives we can take on ourselves. This is the same sort of move he made earlier in this section. On one perspective, the perspective of the world of understanding, we are free, whereas from the other, the perspective of the world of the senses or appearances, natural laws determine everything that happens. There is no contradiction because the claim to freedom applies to one world, and the claim of the laws of nature determining everything applies to the other. The claims do not conflict because they have different targets.|$|E

6000|$|... "Look here, Otter," [...] put in Leonard, [...] "either you are joking {{or you are}} mad. How can <b>we</b> cross <b>that</b> place? <b>We</b> <b>should</b> be dashed {{to pieces}} before we had gone ten yards." ...|$|R
