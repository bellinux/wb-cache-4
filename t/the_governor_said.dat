25|$|A {{compromise}} {{was announced}} on June 24, 2005 by Governor Schwarzenegger. <b>The</b> <b>governor</b> <b>said</b> {{that he and}} State Senate President Pro Tempore Don Perata had reached agreement to resurrect plans for the signature span. Cost estimates of the contract deferral expenses and inflation range attributable to the delay have ranged up to $400 million. Direct costs due to cessation of work included some dismantling of temporary structures and their reconstruction upon the subsequent restart.|$|E
25|$|Following Act 72, Rendell and the Pennsylvania {{legislature}} {{looked at}} other proposals to reduce property taxes, {{a key component}} of his 2002 campaign. <b>The</b> <b>governor</b> <b>said</b> he was willing to consider legislation that changes Act 72, and legislative proposals were made to force school districts to accept the money. Other proposed legislation would have required the issue to be voted on in each district as a ballot question, rather than decided by school boards. Property tax relief and Act 72 were issues of great controversy and have been subject to political gridlock, and it was unclear when changes would be made.|$|E

500|$|The {{prisoners were}} taken to Boston on 22 July and held until their trial on 31 July. They were brought before Governor John Endicott for {{questioning}} and were accused of being Anabaptists. [...] Clarke replied that he was neither an Anabaptist, nor a Pedobaptist (one favoring infant baptism), nor a Catabaptist (one opposing infant baptism). [...] <b>The</b> <b>governor</b> <b>said</b> that the three men [...] "deserved death, {{and he would not}} have such trash brought into his jurisdiction." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1893, Mamie Baxter, a fourteen-year-old girl in Denmark, Barnwell County, {{alleged that}} an African American unknown to her had {{attempted}} to attack her. About twenty black men were detained and paraded before her; she stated that Henry Williams looked something like the man she had seen. Placed on what passed for a trial by the mob that took him from the jail, Williams produced several respected white men to support his alibi. A majority of the mob voted against killing him, and Williams was returned to jail. More searches were made for Baxter's attacker. A suspect in the case, John Peterson, appealed to Tillman for protection, fearing he would be lynched if taken to Denmark, and stating he could prove his innocence. Tillman sent Peterson to Denmark with a single guard. He {{was taken by the}} mob, put on [...] "trial", and after the mob found him guilty, was murdered. There was widespread outrage among both races across the country, both at the actions of the lynchers and at what Tillman had done. <b>The</b> <b>governor</b> <b>said,</b> in response, that he had assumed that, as the mob had been convinced by Williams' defense, it would allow Peterson to prove his innocence as well. He thereafter ignored the issue of the Denmark lynching.|$|E

Now, I can clearly see the perimeters the firefighters have been burning." [...] Napolitano provided for inmate wildland fire crews to provide fire suppression and forest thinning services.|$|E

50|$|Not all SCC agreed. Councillor Tony Heath {{sided with}} the students. Hampshire County Council - which had unwisely {{withdrawn}} a £9-a-week grant from a student, Sally Williams, {{at the request of}} SCC - realized this might be illegal, immoral and bad publicity, and restituted it. 50 parents asked <b>the</b> <b>Governors</b> not to victimise students or staff. <b>The</b> <b>Governors</b> <b>said</b> nothing but brought an injunction against the security guards and cut off the electricity to the College.

2500|$|Campbell {{went on to}} sue Superintendent of the Province of Canterbury James FitzGerald for libel on {{the grounds}} that he had been defamed in FitzGerald's letter to Governor of New Zealand George Grey while seeking Campbell's removal from office. Fitzgerald's letter to <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I request the removal of an officer who has been {{condemned}} by the united voice of the public as wholly unfit to be entrusted with any public office whatever". Campbell initially won the case but the verdict was overturned on appeal on the basis that FitzGerald's letter to the Governor was privileged, that Campbell had not proven that FitzGerald acted in malice, and that Campbell had misstated the alleged libel.|$|E
2500|$|Localities that {{supported}} the right of same-sex couples to marry resisted both those interpretations. On April 11?, Provincetown's Board of Selectmen decided their town clerk would approve marriage license applications from any couple that swore, as was customary, that their marriage was lawful. The town manager said: [...] "We've never been the marriage police with heterosexual couples, and we're not about to start with same-sex couples". Worcester's clerk took a similar position on April 16. Before {{the end of the}} month, an investigation by the Boston Globe showed that since 1976 town clerks had been repeatedly instructed not to question applicants for marriage licenses about their eligibility. A spokesman for <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>said</b> that the Goodridge decision [...] "changed the definition of marriage, it changed the way the new marriage forms look, and it changed the way city and town clerks will carry out the requirements of the law." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2009 [...] "Do You Realize??" [...] was {{announced}} {{as the official}} rock song of Oklahoma. Ten choices were put to a public vote, and out of 21,000 votes cast nearly 51% were for [...] "Do You Realize??" [...] The Oklahoma Senate approved this choice unanimously. The Oklahoma House of Representatives failed to confirm the choice after Rep. Mike Reynolds, R-Oklahoma City attacked the band for its use of offensive language, and Rep. Corey Holland, R-Marlow {{said he had been}} [...] "really offended" [...] when Michael Ivins came to the announcement ceremony in March wearing a red T-shirt with a yellow hammer and sickle. However, that evening Oklahoma governor Brad Henry announced he would sign an executive order naming the song the official rock song. Henry said that for more than 20 years the Flaming Lips have produced [...] "creative, fun and provocative rock music." [...] "The music of the Flaming Lips has earned Grammys, glowing critical acclaim and fans all over the world", <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "A truly iconic rock n' roll band, they are proud ambassadors of their home state... They were clearly the people's choice, and I intend to honor that vote." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Mishnah {{reported}} {{that with the}} death of the former prophets, the Urim and Thummim ceased.. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2000[...] In this connection, the Gemara reported differing views of who the former prophets were. Rav Huna said they were David, Samuel, and Solomon. Rav Nachman said that during the days of David, they were sometimes successful and sometimes not (getting an answer from the Urim and Thummim), for Zadok consulted it and succeeded, while Abiathar consulted it and was not successful, as [...] reports, [...] "And Abiathar went up." [...] (He retired from the priesthood because the Urim and Thummim gave him no reply.) Rabbah bar Samuel asked whether the report of 2 Chronicles [...] "And he (King Uzziah of Judah) set himself to seek God all the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God," [...] did not refer to the Urim and Thummim. But the Gemara answered that Uzziah did so through Zechariah's prophecy. A Baraita told that when the first Temple was destroyed, the Urim and Thummim ceased, and explained [...] (reporting events after the Jews returned from the Babylonian Captivity), [...] "And <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> <b>said</b> to them that they should not eat of the most holy things till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim," [...] as a reference to the remote future, as when one speaks of the time of the Messiah. Rav Nachman concluded that the term [...] "former prophets" [...] referred to a period before Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, who were latter prophets.. And the Jerusalem Talmud taught that the [...] "former prophets" [...] referred to Samuel and David, and thus the Urim and Thummim did not function in the period of the First Temple, either.|$|E
