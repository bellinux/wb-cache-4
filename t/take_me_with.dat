500|$|Nilsen {{performed}} at the annual Øyafestivalen (Island festival) on 10 August 2012. The music festival is held at Middelalderparken (Medieval park) in Nilsen's hometown of Oslo, Norway. [...] Nilsen had previously performed there as a backing singer for Jens Carelius. [...] The festival features four stages, and during Nilsen's opening song, [...] "Ta meg med" [...] (<b>Take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> you), {{it was possible to}} hear the soundcheck of the black metal band, Nekromantheon, but Nilsen seemed unaffected. [...] Among concert reviews, Nilsen was described by one writer as [...] "a fascinating hybrid of melancholy, vulnerable sweetness and inner strength..." [...] This was Nilsen's first concert since the Rockefeller in March 2012, and since giving birth to a daughter two months previous. [...] Commenting on the most recent phase of her life, Nilsen said, [...] "Now I've also got a million new things to write about, there's so much I want to say." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the {{legitimate}} government had relocated to Iași, in besieged Moldavia. Late in 1916, it court-martialled Filitti in absentia, and {{sentenced him to}} death for the crime of high treason. By January 1918, the collapse of Russian forces on the Eastern Front led the Iași administration into negotiating a separate peace with the Central Powers. Germanophile Alexandru Marghiloman took over as Premier, in what seemed to spell a moral victory for the pro-German camp. However, Filitti was drawing closer to the more disgruntled Germanophiles, led by P. P. Carp, who wanted to sign peace on their own terms: [...] "I ask Carp, should he leave to negotiate for Romania, to <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> him. He says that he'll take along his son. I note that one does not exclude the other. He agrees" [...] (January 12, 1918). Filitti was also upset that Marghiloman himself had not yet offered him a high diplomatic post during negotiations over the Buftea-Bucharest Peace Treaty, and noted that the Ententist King, Ferdinand I, [...] "made it hard" [...] {{for him to be}} accepted back into the diplomatic corps. As noted by Georgeta Filitti, Ferdinand vetoed successive proposals to rehire him as public servant.|$|E

An excerpt from his interview - [...] "He encouraged me very much, kept <b>me</b> <b>with</b> him {{and let me}} play for him. Apart from that, I gave a lot of kutcheries in Andhra Pradesh.

2500|$|Garrison {{came under}} {{contemporary}} criticism from writers including Sylvia Meagher, who in 1967 wrote: [...] "...as the Garrison investigation continued to unfold, it gave cause for increasingly serious misgivings {{about the validity}} of his evidence, the credibility of his witnesses, and the scrupulousness of his methods. The fact that many critics of the Warren Report have remained passionate advocates of the Garrison investigation, even condoning tactics which they might not condone on the part of others, is a matter of regret and disappointment." [...] According to Clay Shaw's defense team, witnesses, including Perry Russo, claimed to have been bribed and threatened with perjury and contempt of court charges by Garrison in order to make his case against Shaw. However, in a later interview with public radio, Perry Russo stated: [...] "Well {{the truth of the matter}} was that Garrison was very sincere. Well, [...] Walter Sheridan tells me and threatens me that he's gonna take Garrison out and <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> him.
