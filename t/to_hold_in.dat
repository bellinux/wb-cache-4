5|$|Following Gillibrand's win, Republicans quickly began speculating about {{possible}} 2008 candidates.

5|$|Augustine St. Clare â€“ Tom's {{third owner}} {{and father of}} Eva. St. Clare is complex, often sarcastic, with a ready wit. After a rocky {{courtship}} he marries a woman he grows <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>in</b> contempt, though he is too polite to let it show. St. Clare recognizes the evil in chattel slavery but {{is not willing to}} relinquish the wealth it brings him. After his daughter's death he becomes more sincere in his religious thoughts and starts to read the Bible to Tom. He plans on finally taking action against slavery by freeing his slaves, but his good intentions ultimately come to nothing.|$|E
5|$|By April 2009, market {{research}} firm OTX reported that ODST was the most highly anticipated video game, a spot it continued <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>in</b> late August. Before its release the title was the top-selling game on Amazon.com based on preorders alone, spending 107days atop the merchant's top 100 video games and software list. Copies of ODST were sold early in France. Microsoft responded by launching an investigation and threatening to ban any players on Xbox Live playing ODST before its official release; Xbox lead manager Stephen Toulouse later clarified {{that they would not}} ban legitimate buyers.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War I, he was {{assigned}} to several positions that would qualify him for the high commands he was <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>in</b> later years. He was promoted to first lieutenant on June 4, 1920 and spent two years at Marine Barracks, Quantico, Virginia, as the Adjutant-Registrar of the Marine Corps Institute, after which he was sent on a short tour in Louisiana guarding the mail. His interest in military aviation prompted him to apply for flight training at NAS Pensacola, Florida and he earned his gold wings as a Naval Aviator in 1922. Soon after, he was ordered to the Marine Air Station at Guam where he had his introduction to the semitropical islands of the Marianas with which his name was later to become so closely linked.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} tetrapods, the gastralia and ribs with uncinate processes, {{together}} with bony {{elements such as}} bony plates in the skin (osteoderms) and clavicles (collar bone), would have formed a sort of exoskeleton around the body, protecting the belly and helping <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>in</b> the guts and inner organs. These anatomical details most likely evolved from structures involved in locomotion even before the vertebrates ventured onto land. The gastralia {{may have been involved}} in the breathing process in early amphibians and reptiles. The pelvis and shoulder girdles are arranged differently from those of lizards, as is the case with other parts of the internal anatomy and its scales.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the International Mathematical Olympiads (IMOs) was held in Romania in 1959. The oldest of the International Science Olympiads, the IMO has since been held annually, except in 1980. That year the {{competition}} initially planned <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>in</b> Mongolia was canceled due to soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Because the competition was initially founded for Eastern European countries participating in the Warsaw Pact, {{under the influence of}} the Eastern Bloc, the earlier IMOs were hosted only in Eastern European countries, gradually spreading to other nations. Sources differ about the cities hosting some of the early IMOs and the exact dates when they took place.|$|E
5|$|Elsa, {{princess of}} Arendelle and heiress to the throne, is {{born with the}} ability to create and control ice and snow. As a child, she uses her {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland to play in with her younger sister and best friend, Princess Anna. One night, Elsa accidentally harms Anna with her powers. The king and queen of Arendelle hurriedly take Anna to a tribe of mountain trolls to be healed. While healing Anna, the trolls inform the royals present that Elsa's abilities will grow, becoming both beautiful and very dangerous so she must learn to control them. While the trolls erase Anna's memory of the incident and of her elder sister's powers in general, Elsa is traumatized by the event. The king and queen take steps to control and hide Elsa's ice powers: the castle gates are locked, Elsa is shut away in her bedroom for most of the time, she is given gloves to help suppress her powers and is told <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>in</b> her emotions as well. Nonetheless her powers continue to grow even stronger and so she becomes fearful of harming those she cares about most. Meanwhile, her sister Anna is less happy and confused by the loss of contact with her elder sister and tries, without success, to coax her out of her room. When the sisters grow into teenagers, the ship in which the king and queen are sailing is capsized in a storm and they drown, leaving Anna and Elsa feeling even more lonely.|$|E

5|$|In late April, the Chinese {{launched}} a major counterattack. Though the 24th and 25th Infantry Divisions {{were able to}} hold their ground against the Chinese 9th CPV Army Corps, the South Korean 6th Infantry Division, to the east, was destroyed by the 13th CPV Army Corps, which penetrated the line and threatened to encircle the 24th and 25th divisions. The 1st Marine Division and 27th British Commonwealth Brigade were able to drive the 13th Army Corps back while the 24th and 25th divisions withdrew on 25 April. The UN forces' line was moved back to Seoul but managed <b>to</b> <b>hold.</b> <b>In</b> September, the UN forces {{launched a}}nother counteroffensive with the 24th Infantry Division {{at the center of}} the line, west of the Hwachon Reservoir. Flanked by the South Korean 2nd and 6th Divisions, the 24th advanced past Kumwha, engaging the 20th and 27th CPV Armies. In November, the Chinese attempted to counter this attack but were unsuccessful. It was at this point, after several successive counteroffensives that saw both sides fighting intensely over the same ground, that the two sides started serious peace negotiations.|$|E
