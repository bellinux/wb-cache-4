5|$|The {{first act}} {{in this new}} war was Philip's seizure of 230 grain ships that had been waiting {{on the far side}} of the Bosphorus to be convoyed past Byzantion by Chares. He used the grain for his own {{supplies}} and the ships' timbers to build siege engines. However, what happened over the next few months is unclear; although <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> Philip's activities in 339 BC, he cannot have spent more than three months besieging Byzantion. The walls of Byzantion were very tall and strong, and the city was full of defenders, and well supplied by sea; it is therefore possible Philip gave up on the siege, rather than waste time and men trying to assault it. The Greeks viewed this, and the abandonment of the siege of Perinthos, as a glorious victory. Philip's motives are as unclear as ever; Cawkwell suggests that, since he was now at war with Athens, he decided to go straight to the root of the problem, rather than be detained at Byzantion.|$|E

25|$|He {{received}} no triumph {{on his return}} and did not apparently run for the consulship, but he did marry Julia, the aunt of Julius Caesar. The Julii Caesares were a patrician family, but at this period seem to have {{found it hard to}} advance above the praetorship. (Only once in the 2nd century – in 157 BC – did {{a member of the family}} become consul.) <b>To</b> <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> this marriage, Marius had apparently achieved some substantial political or financial influence by this point (possibly from his governship in Hispania).|$|E
25|$|Perhaps having extra time, Brasseur de Bourbourg began a {{programme}} {{of research}} {{of the history of}} the archdiocese of Quebec, and in particular of its 17th-century founder, François de Laval, the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Quebec (after whom the seminary's later incarnation as a University, the Université Laval, is named). The results of his archival investigations were published during early 1846 as a biography of Laval. The contents of this pamphlet seemed to displease his Canadian colleagues somewhat, for a dispute began which made his job there uncertain, or at least uncomfortable. Also, he apparently disliked the harsh winter climate (<b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> some comments he made in the dedication of his later History of Canada), and may also have been a factor in his departure which was soon to ensue.|$|E

25|$|<b>To</b> <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> the {{accounts}} of wholesale massacres in 115 BCE, the number of Jewish residents in Cyrenaica, Cyprus, and Mesopotamia was also large. At the commencement {{of the reign of}} Caesar Augustus, there were over 7,000 Jews in Rome (though this is only the number that is said to have escorted the envoys who came to demand the deposition of Archelaus; compare: Bringmann: Klaus: Geschichte der Juden im Altertum, Stuttgart 2005, S. 202. Bringmann talks about 8,000 Jews who lived in the city of Rome.). Many sources say that the Jews constituted a full one-tenth (10%) {{of the population of the}} ancient city of Rome itself. Finally, if the sums confiscated by the governor Lucius Valerius Flaccus in the year 62/61 BCE represented the tax of a didrachma per head for a single year, it would imply that the Jewish population of Asia Minor numbered 45,000 adult males, for a total of at least 180,000 persons.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} Hesiod's {{complaints}} about poverty, life on his father's farm {{could not have}} been too uncomfortable if Works and Days is anything <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>by,</b> since he describes the routines of prosperous yeomanry rather than peasants. His farmer employs a friend (Works and Days 370) as well as servants (502, 573, 597, 608, 766), an energetic and responsible ploughman of mature years (469 ff.), a slave boy to cover the seed (441–6), a female servant to keep house (405, 602) and working teams of oxen and mules (405, 607f.). One modern scholar surmises that Hesiod may have learned about world geography, especially the catalogue of rivers in Theogony (337–45), listening to his father's accounts of his own sea voyages as a merchant. The father probably spoke in the Aeolian dialect of Cyme but Hesiod probably grew up speaking the local Boeotian, belonging to the same dialect group. However, while his poetry features some Aeolisms there are no words that are certainly Boeotian. His basic language was the main literary dialect of the time, Homer's Ionian.|$|E
25|$|In the pre-Spanish past, {{there may}} never have existed a unified concept of the afterlife. Among the Pokoman Maya of the Verapaz, Xbalanque was to {{accompany}} the dead king, which suggests a descent into the underworld (called xibalba 'place of fright') like that described in the Popol Vuh Twin myth. The Yucatec Maya had a double concept of the afterlife: Evildoers descended into an underworld (metnal) to be tormented there (a view still held by the 20th-century Lacandons), while others, such as those led by the goddess Ixtab, went {{to a sort of}} paradise. The ancestors of Maya kings (Palenque tomb of Pakal, Berlin pot) are shown sprouting from the earth like fruit trees which, together, constitute a blissful orchard. The so-called 'Flower Mountain' has more specifically been interpreted as a reference to an aquatic and solar paradise. <b>To</b> <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> the marine faunal remains found in Classic tombs and by the accompanying aquatic imagery, this sea paradise may have been the Maya variant of the rain god's paradise (Tlalocan) in Central Mexican religion.|$|E

The royal accounts show large payments made to Cousin: he was among those who decorated Paris for the entry of Henry II as king. Little of his work, however, survives. His most important surviving work is The Last Judgement in the Louvre, which like Caron's art, depicts human beings dwarfed by the landscape and, in Blunt's words, [...] "made to swarm over the earth like worms".|$|E

2500|$|While {{his family}} {{position}} was always vulnerable, {{he did have}} several advantages. [...] He was physically fit and strong, being tall and well-built. [...] He was handsome and although unmarried clearly enjoyed {{the company of the}} opposite sex: [...] extremely personable and very skilled in winning the confidence of his superiors, he possessed charm and charisma. [...] Added to this he was highly intelligent and had been very well educated; an excellent sense of humour rounded off a personality that was the life and soul of any party or other situation. [...] <b>To</b> <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> his surviving letters and drawings, he was a sensitive writer and an excellent artist.|$|E
2500|$|Men's {{hair was}} {{generally}} short and neat {{until the late}} Empire, and often is shown elegantly curled, probably artificially (picture at top). The 9th century Khludov Psalter has Iconophile illuminations which vilify the last Iconoclast Patriarch, John the Grammarian, caricaturing him with untidy hair sticking straight out in all directions. Monk's hair was long, and most clergy had beards, as did many lay men, especially later. Upper-class women mostly wore their hair up, again very often curled and elaborately shaped. [...] If we are <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> religious art, and the few depictions of other women outside the court, women probably kept their hair covered in public, especially when married.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her book}} The Beauty Myth, Naomi Wolf {{reported}} that [...] "thirty-three thousand women told American researchers {{they would rather}} lose ten to fifteen pounds than achieve any other goal." [...] Through repeated images of excessively thin women in media, advertisement, and modeling, thinness has become associated with not only beauty, but happiness and success. As Charisse Goodman {{put it in her}} article, [...] "One Picture is Worth a Thousand Diets," [...] advertisements have changed society's ideas of beauty and ugliness: [...] "Indeed <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> the phrasing of the ads, 'slender' and ‘attractive' are one word, not two in the same fashion as 'fat' and 'ugly.'" [...] This idea of beauty has become drastically more narrow and unachievable, putting increased pressure on people looking to satisfy society's standards.|$|E

By this time, the Saint Sava pupils began attending literary- and social-themed conferences at the Romanian Atheneum. It was there that Bassarabescu met the successful writer Alexandru Vlahuță, who gave him some of his first literary pointers. Soon, Bassarabescu's pieces were hosted by Revista Nouă, a literary journal managed by Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu (1893). This was an impressive feat, <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> Bassarabescu's own words: [...] "imposingly grand" [...] and [...] "too expensive" [...] venture, Revista Nouă had fascinated him and his Saint Sava colleagues. He also dabbled in parodic poetry, some of which was published by the Symbolist review, Literatorul.|$|E
2500|$|Raphael {{was one of}} {{the finest}} draftsmen in the history of Western art, and used {{drawings}} extensively to plan his compositions. According to a near-contemporary, when beginning to plan a composition, he would lay out a large number of stock drawings of his on the floor, and begin to draw [...] "rapidly", borrowing figures from here and there. Over forty sketches survive for the Disputa in the Stanze, and there may well have been many more originally; over four hundred sheets survive altogether. He used different drawings to refine his poses and compositions, apparently {{to a greater extent than}} most other painters, <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> the number of variants that survive: [...] "... This is how Raphael himself, who was so rich in inventiveness, used to work, always coming up with four or six ways to show a narrative, each one different from the rest, and all of them full of grace and well done." [...] wrote another writer after his death. For John Shearman, Raphael's art marks [...] "a shift of resources away from production to research and development".|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the best}} known {{paintings}} of Helnwein's oeuvre is Epiphany I – Adoration of the Magi, (1996, oil and acrylic on canvas, 210cm x 333cm, collection of the Denver Art Museum). It is part of a series of three paintings: Epiphany I, Epiphany II (Adoration of the Shepherds), Epiphany III (Presentation at the Temple), created between 1996 and 1998. In Epiphany I, SS officers surround a mother and child group. <b>To</b> <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> their looks and gestures, they appear to be interested in details such as head, face, back and genitals. The arrangement of the figures clearly relates to motive and iconography of the adoration of the three Magi, such as were common especially in the German, Italian and Dutch 15th century artworks. Julia Pascal wrote about this work in the New Statesman: [...] "This Austrian Catholic Nativity scene has no Magi bearing gifts. Madonna and child are encircled by five respectful Waffen SS officers palpably in awe of the idealised, blonde Virgin. The Christ toddler, who stands on Mary's lap, stares defiantly out of the canvas." [...] Helnwein's baby Jesus is often considered to represent Adolf Hitler.|$|E
