500|$|Texans {{knew of the}} {{oil that}} lay beneath {{the ground in the}} state for decades, but this was often seen more as a problem than a benefit because it {{hindered}} the digging of water wells. Rancher William Thomas Waggoner (1852–1934), who later became an influential oil businessman in Fort Worth, struck oil while drilling for water in 1902. He was quoted as having said, [...] "I wanted water, and <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> oil. I tell you I was mad, mad clean through. We needed water for ourselves and for our cattle to drink." ...|$|E
500|$|Even some staunch traditionalists {{from both}} the urban and rural folk music {{communities}} had an affinity for the Kingstons' polished commercial versions of older songs. In her memoir And A Voice To Sing With, singer and activist Joan Baez recalled that [...] "Traveling across the country {{with my mother and}} sisters, we heard the commercial songs of the budding folk boom for the first time, the Kingston Trio's 'Tom Dooley' and 'Scotch and Soda.' Before I turned into a snob and learned to look down upon all commercial folk music as bastardized and unholy, I loved the Kingston Trio. When I became one of the leading practitioners of 'pure folk,' I still loved them..." [...] Arthel [...] "Doc" [...] Watson of North Carolina, {{one of the most respected}} and influential musicians performing traditional music, remarked, [...] "I’ll tell you who pointed all our noses in the right direction, even the traditional performers. They got us interested in trying to put the good stuff out there—the Kingston Trio. <b>They</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> interested in it!" ...|$|E
500|$|The TPF {{formed a}} phalanx and {{attempted}} to clear the streets by marching slowly and pushing the crowd back. The mob openly mocked the police. The crowd cheered, started impromptu kick lines, and sang {{to the tune of}} Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay: [...] "We are the Stonewall girls/ We wear our hair in curls/ We don't wear underwear/ We show our pubic hair." [...] Lucian Truscott reported in The Village Voice: [...] "A stagnant situation there brought on some gay tomfoolery {{in the form of a}} chorus line facing the line of helmeted and club-carrying cops. Just as the line got into a full kick routine, the TPF advanced again and cleared the crowd of screaming gay powerites down Christopher to Seventh Avenue." [...] One participant who had been in the Stonewall during the raid recalled, [...] "The police rushed us, and that's when I realized this is not a good thing to do, because <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> in the back with a nightstick." [...] Another account stated, [...] "I just can't ever get that one sight out of my mind. The cops with the [...] and the kick line on the other side. It was the most amazing thing... And all the sudden that kick line, which I guess was a spoof on the machismo... I think that's when I felt rage. Because people were getting smashed with bats. And for what? A kick line." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{controversial}} single [...] "Welcome to the Terrordome" [...] references {{the murder}} of Yusef Hawkins and the 1989 riots in Virginia Beach, and it has Chuck D criticizing Jewish leaders who protested Public Enemy in response to Professor Griff's anti-Semitic remarks. He addresses the controversy as being {{in the center of}} political turmoil, with criticisms of the media and references to the Crucifixion of Jesus: [...] "Crucifixion ain't no fiction / So called chosen frozen / Apology made to who ever pleases / Still <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> like Jesus". He is also critical of Blacks and those who [...] "blame somebody else when you destroy yourself": [...] "Every brother ain't a brother / 'cause a Black hand squeezed on Malcolm X the man / the shootin of Huey Newton / from the hand of Nig who pulled the trigger". His lyricism features dizzying raps and internal rhyme: [...] "Lazer, anastasia, maze ya / Ways to blaze your brain and train ya [...] Sad to say I got sold down the river / Still some quiver when I deliver / Never to say I never knew or had a clue / Word was heard, plus hard on the boulevard / Lies, scandalizin', basin' / Traits of hate who's celebratin' wit Satan?". Its dense production incorporates numerous samples, including several James Brown tracks and the guitar line from The Temptations' [...] "Psychedelic Shack". Several other samples are heard amid Chuck D's rapping, such as the line [...] "come on, you can get it-get it-get it" [...] from Instant Funk's [...] "I Got My Mind Made Up (You Can Get It Girl)". AllMusic's John Bush cites the track as [...] "the production peak of the Bomb Squad and one of Chuck D.'s best rapping performances ever ... one of their tracks were more musically incendiary".|$|E
500|$|After {{reading the}} harsh reviews of [...] "Friday", Black said that [...] "those hurtful {{comments}} really shocked me." [...] Ark Music {{offered to take}} the video down from YouTube, but Black refused the offer, saying {{that she did not}} wish [...] "to give the haters the satisfaction that <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> so bad I gave up." [...] Black's father has accompanied her in public to guard against potential accosters. In response to criticism over the song's significant use of Auto-Tune, Black performed an acoustic version during an interview with ABC News, which earned over 180,000 dislikes on YouTube (84% of total ratings) by November 2011. Later in the interview Black's mother, Kelly, stated that she was [...] "angry and upset" [...] after Black was brought to tears by comments, such as [...] "I hope you go cut yourself and die" [...] and [...] "'I hope you cut yourself and get an eating disorder so you'll look pretty." [...] Black said, however, that soon she was able to ignore such comments, and asked Justin Bieber, her idol, to perform a duet with her. Although Bieber has not released an official announcement regarding the offer, he posted on Twitter [...] "sunday comes after saturday? weird." [...] Bieber later sang part of the chorus at one of his concerts. Rolling Stone's Perpetua again praised Black after the interview and said, [...] "She is actually a pretty decent singer. [...] She is a total sweetheart. [...] Black comes off as a well-adjusted, happy and grateful kid." [...] He also pointed out Black's intention to donate part of the profits from the song to school arts programs and relief efforts in Japan following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Benni Cinkle, who became known as [...] "that girl in pink" [...] and appears during the second verse of the video, released her own song entitled [...] "Can You See Me Now" [...] and created an anti-bullying organization (That Girl In Pink Foundation) due to the negative response she got from [...] "Friday".|$|E
2500|$|The {{controversy}} and apologies {{on behalf of}} Griff spurred Chuck D to reference the negative press they were receiving. In 1990, Public Enemy issued the single [...] "Welcome to the Terrordome", which contains the lyrics: [...] "Crucifixion ain't no fiction / So-called chosen frozen / Apologies made to whoever pleases / Still <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> like Jesus". These lyrics have been cited by some in the media as anti-Semitic, making supposed references {{to the concept of}} the [...] "chosen people" [...] with the lyric [...] "so-called chosen" [...] and Jewish deicide with the last line.|$|E

6000|$|... "Dear heart," [...] he said merrily, [...] "I deserve {{that you}} should leave me to rot in this abominable cage. <b>They</b> haven't <b>got</b> <b>me</b> yet, little woman, you know; I am not yet dead--only d--d sleepy at times. But I'll cheat them even now, never fear." ...|$|R

2500|$|The 1940s saw Bleifer's career {{continue}} on the same path he had taken in the prior decade. [...] He had numerous small roles, many nameless and un-credited, as in: Archie Mayo's 1940 version of Four Sons, starring Don Ameche; the war film Paris Calling (1942), starring Basil Rathbone, Randolph Scott, and Elisabeth Bergner; the comedy <b>They</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Me</b> Covered (1943), starring Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour; Mr. Lucky, starring Cary Grant and Laraine Day; the classic For Whom the Bell Tolls, starring Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman; and the 1946 comedy Without Reservations, starring John Wayne and Claudette Colbert.

2500|$|Scherzinger credits Whitney Houston {{as being}} her {{greatest}} musical influence and idol, saying {{she wanted to}} [...] "be Whitney" [...] when she grew up. She admired Houston {{so much that she}} auditioned with her version of [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] at her Popstars audition. When Scherzinger was growing up in her home town of Louisville, she received a Christmas gift (at the age of six) of a tiny purple boombox and a cassette of Whitney Houston's chart-topping 1985 self-titled debut album. [...] "My parents had no money, but <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> this player and Whitney's album, which had [...] "The Greatest Love of All" [...] on it," [...] Scherzinger recalls. [...] "That was it for me. From that moment on I wanted to sing. Her voice was so powerful; every note she sang just felt like the truth." [...] Scherzinger also named Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Roberta Flack, Sade Adu, Alanis Morissette, Toni Braxton and Tina Turner as her biggest influences while growing up. Scherzinger said that Beyoncé also inspired her, stating: [...] "I am inspired by women like Beyoncé who wear costumes that aren't much but they are real artists and they put real artistry into what they do and that is how I pride myself." [...] Scherzinger said while she is on stage performing, she borrows personas of Tina Turner and Mick Jagger: [...] "The way he [...] prances around stage and the poise he has on stage. But I love Tina Turner's attitude and sass. I steal from her all the time, especially being the lead singer of this group, the Pussycat Dolls, to be fearless and just have that attitude and that soul behind you." [...] Scherzinger also cites Gwen Stefani as an influence. Janet Jackson and MIA are also influences to her. When Scherzinger was older, Mariah Carey became a huge influence to her. She also wished to work with the Black Eyed Peas saying she admired their music. Scherzinger is also a fan of Adele. Critically acclaimed, [...] "Pop Prince", Prince also became a big influence when she was in her teens. Michael Jackson was one of Scherzinger's biggest influences and idols. Paula Abdul, who Scherzinger sat alongside on the judging panel of The X Factor, was one of her influences. When she gained the role on Men in Black 3, Scherzinger said that music was a very big part of her inspiration for the character, which she plays for the film. She said, [...] "I listened to my heavier music and I listened to Led Zeppelin and I kind of got in that frame of mind because music is what inspires me most. I worked with my acting coach a lot and she told me about lots of crazy things to think about while I was in character, but I better not tell you what she said." [...] Scherzinger said that the role has inspired her to record differently on her second studio album.|$|E

50|$|Denied {{access to}} his son and with the court {{appearance}} looming, Gallacher began to get increasingly irrational.

[...] This memorial stone was later removed by Union forces during one of their raids. (Two markers survive on that same site in the present-day National Battlefield - an older one placed by veterans of the 7th Georgia in 1903, and a newer bronze marker erected in the 20th century.) ...|$|R

Let this be as it might, I was kindly treated; living, in all respects, as if I {{were one of the}} family. There was no son; and they all seemed to consider me as one.|$|R

5000|$|Cohen {{says when}} he filmed in Harlem the local gangsters {{threatened}} to disrupt the shoot unless they were paid off. He offered them small roles in the film instead.

I just immediately felt a connection to that style of music and drumming." ...|$|R
