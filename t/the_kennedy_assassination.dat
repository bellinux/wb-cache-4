5|$|Jim Dawson devoted {{an entire}} chapter of his 2006 Modern History of the Fart to Shatner's alleged {{flatulence}} in Mind Meld, which he compares {{to the sound}} of someone stepping on a tribble. G. Noel Gross of DVD Talk compared the excitement over this sound to that evinced by adolescent boys watching pornography, and compared the level of scrutiny devoted to the scene to that received by the Zapruder film of <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>assassination.</b>|$|E
5|$|Leavelle's {{design is}} based on Texan detective Jim Leavelle, as he {{appeared}} when escorting Lee Harvey Oswald when Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby. Leavelle trains the bodyguards by pretending to shoot their protectee from a grassy knoll on a cart. This is {{a reference to the}} grassy knoll at the site of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, Dealey Plaza and a scene from <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>assassination</b> film Executive Action (1973).|$|E
5|$|In November 1966 Life {{published}} {{a series of}} photographs from the film that Abraham Zapruder took of <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>assassination.</b> Alvarez, an expert in optics and photoanalysis, became intrigued by the pictures and began to study what could {{be learned from the}} film. Alvarez demonstrated both in theory and experiment that the backward snap of the President's head was fully consistent with his being shot from behind. He also investigated the timing of the gunshots and the shockwave which disturbed the camera, and the speed of the camera, pointing out a number of things which the FBI photoanalysts either overlooked or got wrong. He produced a paper intended as a tutorial, with informal advice for the physicist intent on arriving at the truth.|$|E

5|$|Stone {{wanted to}} {{recreate}} <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>assassination</b> in Dealey Plaza. His producers {{had to pay}} the Dallas City Council {{a substantial amount of}} money to hire police to reroute traffic and close streets for three weeks. He only had ten days to shoot all of the footage he needed and so he used seven cameras (two 35mm and five 16mm) and 14 film stocks. Getting permission to shoot in the Texas School Book Depository was more difficult. They had to pay $50,000 to put someone in the window from which Oswald was supposed to have shot Kennedy. They were allowed to film in that location only between certain hours with only five people on the floor at one time: the camera crew, an actor and Stone. Co-producer Clayton Townsend has said that the hardest part was getting the permission to restore the building to the way it looked back in 1963. It took five months of negotiation.|$|E

25|$|After the Shaw trial, Garrison wrote {{three books}} on <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>assassination,</b> A Heritage of Stone (1970), The Star Spangled Contract (1976, fiction, {{but based on}} the JFK assassination), and his best-seller, On the Trail of the Assassins (1988). A Heritage of Stone, {{published}} by Putnam, places responsibility for the assassination on the CIA and says the Warren Commission, the Executive Branch, members of the Dallas Police Department, the pathologists at Bethesda, and various others lied to the American public. The book does not mention Shaw or Garrison's investigation of Shaw.|$|E

Many documents related to this investigation remain classified, and are slated to remain secret until 2027. In 2010, as in earlier years, some argued for passage of a proposed Records Collection Act, similar to a 1992 law concerning <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>assassination,</b> in order to require the immediate release of the records. The measure did not pass.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>assassination</b> spotlighted the bravery of two Secret Service agents.

While the shooting continued, Hill leapt from the running board of the car he was riding on and jumped {{onto the back of}} the President's moving car and guided Mrs. Kennedy from the trunk back into the rear seat of the car. He then shielded the President and the First Lady with his body until the car arrived at the hospital.|$|E

Pershing Gervais, Garrison's former chief investigator, testified that Garrison had received approximately $3,000 every two months for nine years from the dealers. Acting as his own defense attorney, Garrison called the allegations baseless and claimed that they were concocted {{as part of a}} U.S. government effort to destroy him because of Garrison's efforts to implicate the CIA in <b>the</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>assassination.</b> The jury found Garrison not guilty. In an interview conducted by New Orleans reporter Rosemary James with Pershing Gervais, James alleged Gervais had admitted to concocting the charges.|$|E
