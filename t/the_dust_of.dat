5|$|The {{petrification}} motif {{also appears}} in non-scriptural works. The Raghuvamsa of Kalidasa (generally dated 4th century CE) {{notes that the}} wife of Gautama (unnamed here) momentarily becomes the wife of Indra. Without explicitly mentioning the curse, it relates further that she regains her beautiful form and casts away her stony appearance, owing to the grace provided by <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> <b>of</b> Rama's feet, which redeems her. Gautam Patel, author of many works about Kalidasa, credits him as {{the first person to}} introduce the petrification motif. In the Ramavataram too, Rama does not have to touch Ahalya with his foot; the dust from his feet is enough to bring her back to life. As in other versions of the tale, the repentant Ahalya is turned to stone, only to be liberated by Rama, and Indra runs away disguised as a cat but is cursed to bear the marks of a thousand vulvae. The Ramavataram {{is an example of the}} Bhakti-era poets who exalt Rama as a saviour.|$|E

30|$|For {{reasons of}} clarification, we compare our {{discussion}} {{with a similar}} work by Inoue (2011). Inoue (2011) defined a critical metallicity to compare <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> destruction by SN shocks with that <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> mass growth. Thus, the critical metallicity of Inoue (2011) is the metallicity at which <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> mass growth exceeds that <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> destruction. In contrast, our critical metallicity is the metallicity at which <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> mass growth becomes the main source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> (<b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> mass ejected by stars is <b>the</b> main source <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> {{at an early stage}} of galaxy evolution). Those interested in both works should bear this difference in mind.|$|R

25|$|The theory {{contains}} only one half {{the explanation of}} man's origins and needs spiritualism to carry it through and complete it. For while this ascent on the physical side has been progressing through myriads of ages, the Divine descent has also been going on – man being spiritually an incarnation from the Divine {{as well as a}} human development from the animal creation. The cause of the development is spiritual. Mr. Darwin's theory does not in the least militate against ours – we think it necessitates it; he simply does not deal with our side of the subject. He can not go lower than <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> <b>of</b> the earth for the matter of life; and for us, the main interest of our origin must lie in the spiritual domain.|$|E

500|$|Mr. Pound has shaken <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> <b>of</b> London {{from his}} feet with not too {{emphatic}} {{a gesture of}} disgust, but, at least, without gratitude to this country.... has been an exhilarating influence for culture in England; he has left his mark upon {{more than one of}} the arts, upon literature, music, poetry and sculpture, and quite a number of men and movements owe their initiation to his self-sacrificing stimulus... With all this, however, Mr. Pound, like so many others who have striven for advancement of intelligence and culture in England, has made more enemies than friends... Much of the Press has been deliberately closed by cabal to him; his books have for some time been ignored or written down; and he himself has been compelled to live on much less than would support a navvy. His fate, as I have said, is not unusual... Taken by and large, England hates men of culture until they are dead.|$|E

500|$|Crowd noise, {{especially}} {{coughing and}} crying babies, {{was a significant}} impediment to Sunday's preaching because the wooden tabernacles were so acoustically live. During his preliminaries, Rodeheaver often instructed audiences about how to muffle their coughs. Nurseries were always provided, infants forbidden, and Sunday sometimes appeared rude in his haste to rid the hall of noisy children who had slipped through the ushers. Tabernacle floors were covered with sawdust to dampen the noise of shuffling feet (as well as for its pleasant smell {{and its ability to}} hold down <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> <b>of</b> dirt floors), and coming forward during the invitation became known as [...] "hitting the sawdust trail." [...] The term was first used in a Sunday campaign in Bellingham, Washington, in 1910. Apparently, [...] "hitting the sawdust trail" [...] had first been used by loggers in the Pacific Northwest to describe following home a trail of previously dropped sawdust through an uncut forest — a metaphor for coming from, in Nell Sunday's words, [...] "a lost condition to a saved condition." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} first {{released}} in the United States on July 27, 1983 by Sire Records. It was originally slated to be titled Lucky Star, after the track of the same name, but eventually titled simply Madonna, perhaps that this singular name could have star power. The album's artwork was shot by photographer Gary Heery and directed by Carin Goldberg.

500|$|Most of {{the fifth}} chapter of the Bala Kanda Book of the Adhyatma Ramayana (embedded in the Brahmanda Purana, c. 14th century) is {{dedicated}} to the Ahalya episode. Like most other versions of the story, Ahalya is turned into stone and advised to engross herself in meditation of Rama, [...] "the Supreme Lord". When Rama touches the stone with his foot on Vishvamitra's advice, Ahalya rises as a beautiful maiden and sings a long panegyric dedicated to Rama. She describes his iconographic form and exalts him as an avatar of Vishnu and source of the universe to whom many divinities pay their respects. After worshipping him, she returns to Gautama. At the end of the narrative, Ahalya's hymn is prescribed as an ideal benediction for a devotee to gain Rama's favour. The Awadhi Ramacharitamanasa (16th century) drops the narrative of Indra's visit to Ahalya. In this epic, Vishvamitra tells Rama that the cursed Ahalya has assumed the form of a rock and is patiently awaiting the dust from Rama's feet. Ahalya tells Rama that Gautama was right to pronounce the curse, and she deems it as the greatest favour, for as a result, she feasted her eyes on Rama, who liberated her from her worldly existence. As in the Adhyatma Ramayana, Ahalya lauds Rama as the great Lord served by other divinities, asks for the boon of eternal engrossment in his devotion and afterwards leaves for her husband's abode. The narrative ends with praise for Rama's compassion. Tulsidas alludes to this episode numerous times in the Ramacharitamanasa while highlighting the significance of Rama's benevolence. Commenting on this narrative in the Ramacharitamanasa, Rambhadracharya says that Rama destroyed three things: the sin of Ahalya by his sight, the curse by <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> <b>of</b> his feet and the affliction by the touch of his feet, evidenced by the use of the Tribhangi (meaning [...] "destroyer of the three") metre in the verses which form Ahalya's panegyric.|$|E
