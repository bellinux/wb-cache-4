The {{surviving}} {{parts from}} those cars were recycled {{in the construction}} of the shared V&SAR Dynamometer car, for the purpose of evaluating locomotive performance. This had previously been achieved with the Dynagraph car, but that did not have the capacity or strength to handle the power output from more modern locomotives. The new car entered service in 1932 for use on both the Victorian and South Australian Railways, and was initially used to <b>test</b> <b>rolling</b> resistance differences between four-wheeled wagons against bogie wagons. Following that, the car was used to test the strength of the S Class locomotives, particularly with loaded freight trains between Wallan and Seymour, and the efficiency of Pulverised Brown Coal (PBC) with engines X32 and later R707. It was also used in tests comparing the performance of Tait and Harris electric trains. Over the life of the vehicle, nearly 1,000 tests were performed.|$|E

Current criteria for acceptable test roller penetration are empirical. Two theoretical approaches for modeling <b>test</b> <b>rolling</b> are developed. One is analytic and the other is numerical, based on the finite element code ABAQUS. Both approaches relate wheel penetration to wheel geometry, wheel load, and soil strength parameters (friction angle and cohesion). Elastic soil properties are included in the numerical simulations but play a secondary role. The models accommodate both rigid and flexible wheels. Homogeneous and layered soil structures are considered. Scaled laboratory tests support the theoretical predictions, although full validation requires execution of extensive full scale field testing.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Test</b> <b>rolling</b> is {{a quality}} {{assessment}} technique performed on road construction materials to verify consistency prior to paving. In this test, the depth {{to which the}} wheels of a heavy vehicle penetrate the material {{is used as a}} measure of quality. Current <b>test</b> <b>rolling</b> specifications are based largely on empirical data. In this paper, theoretical models are presented for the case of a test roller on cohesive soil which may be used to evaluate the effects of soil properties, wheel geometry, and wheel load on wheel penetration depth. The case of a towed wheel is considered. An approxi-mate analytic approach premised on a three-dimensional bearing capacity formulation is presented for indentation and steady-state rolling of rigid wheels. The finite element code ABAQUS is used to perform three-dimensional simulation and validate the analytic approach. Theoretical predictions are compared to experimental data, and reasonable agreement is found. ...|$|E

40|$|Torsion <b>test</b> <b>rolling</b> {{simulations}} {{have been}} performed in different conditions (pass strain, interpass time) for a V-microalloyed steel (C= 0. 165; V= 0. 170 wt%). The accumulated stress (Δσ) in austenite at temperatures below the no-recrystallisation temperature (Tnr) has been measured. The accumulated stress {{is directly related to}} the dislocation density. The ferrite grain size (Dα) obtained after hot rolling simulations for different conditions and a cooling rate of 3. 5 K/s has been measured. Dα is found to be dependent on Δσ and on the austenite grain size prior to the austenite–ferrite transformation during cooling. On the other hand, a higher strain accelerates recrystallisation between passes, lowers the Tnr value, and consequently leads to a smaller accumulated stress. It is seen that a minimum value of 15 MPa must be reached in order for Dα refinement to begin. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to empirically re-investigate the money-prices nexus for Malaysia through the Johansen multivariate cointegration and the modified Wald (MWALD) causality techniques. This study covered the monthly dataset from 1971 :M 1 to 2008 :M 11. The Johansen cointegration test suggests that the variables under investigation are co-move in the long run. Furthermore, the MWALD causality test shows a bidirectional causal relationship between money supply (M 2) and aggregate prices, meaning that both the monetarist's and also the structuralists' views are vindicated in the Malaysian economy. However, the time-varying cointegration and causality tests indicate that the cointegrating and also the causal relationships are not stable over the analysis period. These results suggest that inflation in Malaysia is not purely a monetary phenomenon. Therefore, implementing a tighter monetary policy may not be an effective macro-economic instrument in managing the inflationary behaviour in the Malaysian economy.

The RBT and BWT results showed that limestone aggregates perform better than granite aggregates and that, for unmodified binders, stiffer binders provide better moisture resistance compared with softer binder. Both tests were sensitive to aggregate type, binder type and anti-stripping agent type. Ranking of the mixtures by RBT and BWT was in general agreement with the surface energy-based tests, especially for mixtures that performed worst or best in RBT and BWT. The magnitude of the work of debonding in the presence of water was found to be aggregate type dependent which suggests the physico-chemical properties of aggregates may play a fundamental and more significant role in the generation of moisture damage, than bitumen properties...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, millet prices in Niger have enjoyed periods of {{spectacular}} increase during which they seem to go well above their fundamental value. These episodes of price bursts followed by rapid reversals {{could be attributed to}} the presence of rational speculative bubbles. Considering millet as a food asset we have developed a pricing model, and tested for the presence of periodically and partially collapsing bubbles for 15 millet markets in Niger. The test strategy consists of estimating the fundamental value of millet and investigating the dynamic properties of price deviations from fundamentals. A battery of unit root tests aimed at controlling for skewness and kurtosis, and for non linearity in the bubble process, is implemented. These tests do not reject the presence of rational bubbles for some of the sample markets, and allow the identification of expanding and collapsing phases in bubble processes. The results show that small markets, located in deficit and remote areas are more prone to speculation than large markets in the main producing and consuming regions. periodically collapsing bubbles, M-TAR, Markov switching ADF, Residual Augmented ADF <b>test,</b> <b>Rolling</b> ADF test, millet...|$|E

Factors affecting correlations are discussed (e. g., soil type, moisture contents, stress level, etc.). Measurements from earth pressure cells document {{the relationship between}} in-ground stresses for rollers and various in-situ test methods. Comparisons were made between test roller rut depth measurements and IC-MVs and various point measurements as a quality assurance (QA) check for the subgrade pavement foundation layer. It was concluded that IC-MVs and in-situ point measurements can serve as reliable alternatives to <b>test</b> <b>rolling.</b> Site specific target values were calculated for IC-MVs, dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP), light weight deflectometer, (LWD), and shear strength. Measurement error and protocols for field testing were evaluated for LWDs. Laboratory compacted samples {{were used to assess}} an approach for determining LWD field target values. Future research is recommended to evaluate this approach for materials on a state-wide basis. Results from field studies were used to develop four IC specification options. Three specifications do not require on-site roller calibration. One specification option requires on-site calibration of IC-MVs and in-situ point measurements. This specification option has the advantages of quantifying risk, establishing a framework for a performance specification, providing information for incentive-based pay, and better linking as-built quality to long-term performance. An IC training/certification program, new IC field data analysis tools, and additional pilot projects will assist with greater implementation of these technologies...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Rolling {{resistance}} {{is one of}} the most substantial energy losses when the wheel moves on soft soil. Rolling resistance value optimization will help to improve energy efficiency. Accurate modeling of the interaction soil-tire is an important key to this optimization and has eliminated the need for costly field tests and has reduced the time required to <b>test.</b> <b>Rolling</b> resistance will change because of the tire and wheel motion parameters and characteristics of the ground surface. Some tire design parameters are more important such as the tire diameter, width, tire aspect ratio, lugs form, inflation pressure and mechanical properties of tire structure. On the other hand, the soil or ground surface characteristics include soil type; moisture content and bulk density have an important role in this phenomenon. In addition, the vertical load and the wheel motion parameters such as velocity and tire slip are the other factors which impact on tire rolling resistance. According to same studies about the rolling resistance of the wheel, the wheel is significantly affected by the dynamic load. Tire inflation pressure impacted on rolling resistance of tires that were moving on hard surfaces. Studies showed that the rolling resistance of tires with low inflation pressure (less than 100 kPa) was too high. According to Zoz and Griss researches, increasing the tire pressure increases rolling resistance on soft soil but reduces the rolling resistance of on-road tires and tire-hard surface interaction. Based on these reports, the effect of velocity on tire rolling resistance for tractors and vehicles with low velocity (less than 5 meters per second) is usually insignificant. According to Self and Summers studies, rolling resistance of the wheel is dramatically affected by dynamic load on the wheel. Artificial Neural Network {{is one of the}} best computational methods capable of complex regression estimation which is an advantage of this method compared with the analytical and statistical methods. It is expected that the neural network can more accurately predict the rolling resistance. In this study, the neural network for experimental data was trained and the relationship among some parameters of velocity, dynamic load and tire pressure and rolling resistance were evaluated. Materials and Methods: The soil bin and single wheel tester of Biosystem Engineering Mechanics Department of Urmia University was used in this study. This soil bin has 24 m length, 2 m width and 1 m depth including a single-wheel tester and the carrier. Tester consists of four horizontal arms and a vertical arm to vertical load. The S-shaped load cells were employed in horizontal arms with a load capacity of 200 kg and another 500 kg in the vertical arm was embedded. The tire used in this study was a general pneumatic tire (Good year 9. 5 L- 14, 6 ply) In this study, artificial neural networks were used for optimizing the rolling resistance by 35 neurons, 6 inputs and 1 output choices. Comparison of neural network models according to the mean square error and correlation coefficient was used. In addition, 60...|$|E

At the same time, however, this forming technique causes complex non-linear problems resulting from variable contact conditions in the deformation zone.
