50|$|The {{rotary engine}} was {{installed}} above the rear axle. It was compact, light and very free revving {{in comparison with}} conventional engines of the time. By ignoring the manufacturer's recommendations it was possible <b>to</b> <b>rev</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> briefly above 7000 rpm in the lower gears and thereby to achieve a 0 - 100 km/h (0 - 62 mph) time of 14.5 seconds: other sources, presumably based on following the manufacturer's recommendations, give a time of 15.7 seconds.|$|E
50|$|The {{opening scene}} is Bondi Beach in Sydney. The backpackers climb into their Kombi van and embark upon their {{journey into the}} outback. When driving on the Stuart Highway late one night, they are flagged down by a bearded man driving a ute. Falconio disappears {{around the back of}} the Kombi with the man, and tells Lees <b>to</b> <b>rev</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> She does so, and a gunshot can be heard. Lees cries out for Falconio, but he does not answer back, and he is not seen again after this point.|$|E
5000|$|Dwight {{is first}} {{introduced}} {{as a man}} who lives in total abstinence in order to keep out of trouble. Having a history of bad tempers, wild drinking and wild love affairs (as well as a mysterious, but seemingly significant, incident involving his father, briefly mentioned in A Dame to Kill For) he lives completely denying himself even a taste of what he refers to as [...] "the fire". During this time he appears to be a tortured soul who is afraid even <b>to</b> <b>rev</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> of his Mustang or grow his hair, all the while trying to not 'let the monster out.' ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1987 Jimmy was {{surprised}} when his race boat engine builder instructed him not <b>to</b> <b>rev</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> beyond 5800 rpm [...] To Cazzani this made no sense [...]Jimmy dissected <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> and decided to change their internal geometry which would change their operational characteristics [...] <b>The</b> <b>engine's</b> internals were replaced with light, strong components [...] The change in operating range would require larger camshafts, better flowing cylinder heads, large volume intake manifolds and higher CFM (cubic foot per minute) carburetors [...] With the extra work produced by <b>the</b> new <b>engine</b> combination durability could become an issue but Cazzani kept the motors on a strict maintenance schedule and introduced lightweight, exotic titanium valvetrain components into the equation to ensure durability of these endurance racing motors.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> {{has four}} valves per cylinder, with {{chain-driven}} double overhead camshafts, and {{variable valve timing}} for both inlet and exhaust camshafts. [...] Charged intake air is cooled by two side-mounted intercoolers (SMIC)s. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> is controlled by two Bosch DI-Motronic ME9.1.2 engine control units, which act as 'master' and 'slave': two ECUs are required due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> high <b>revs</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> can achieve. [...] It also uses mapped direct ignition system with ten individual direct-acting spark coils, an electronic drive by wire throttle (Bosch [...] "E-Gas"), cylinder-selective knock control, and cylinder bank adaptive lambda control, utilising eight lambda sensors.|$|R
5000|$|From ~5200 RPM <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rev</b> limiter, <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> {{high-lift}} VTEC {{cam lobe}} is engaged. A higher lift lowers restriction even more, giving the highest airflow. If one built a non-VTEC <b>engine</b> to make <b>the</b> maximum power, the trade-off {{would be very}} low efficiency at low RPMs {{in order to get}} the most flow possible at high RPMs. A three-stage allows <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> to run in [...] "economy", [...] "standard", and [...] "high power" [...] modes, while a VTEC only gives [...] "standard" [...] and [...] "high power", and a VTEC-E only gives [...] "economy" [...] and [...] "standard".|$|R
50|$|Two {{different}} valvetrains {{are present}} on this engine series. The L12A, L13A, and L15A use (i-DSI), or “intelligent Dual & Sequential Ignition”. i-DSI utilizes two spark plugs per cylinder which fire at different intervals during the combustion process {{to achieve a}} more complete burn of the gasoline. This process allows the engine to have more power while keeping fuel consumption low, thanks to the better gasoline utilization. Emissions are also reduced. The i-DSI engines have two to five valves per cylinder and a modest redline of only 6,000 rpm, but reach maximum torque at mid-range rpm, allowing for better performance without having <b>to</b> <b>rev</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> at high speeds.|$|E
5000|$|Some models also {{received}} the [...] "Auto Adaptive" [...] gearbox, which supposedly assesses the driver's driving style, then switches {{to the most}} appropriate of approximately 6 onboard programmes. This gearbox was further enhanced by a [...] "Sport" [...] mode button (in addition to the sports button for the suspension), which shortened the gear change times, therefore offering a more responsive experience. The final new upgrade effecting the driving experience saw {{the introduction of a}} [...] "Snow Mode" [...] button, located next to the new sport mode button. Although rarely used in some countries, this was a surprisingly effective addition to the driver's arsenal; during any notable falls of snow that may affect the road ahead, a simple push of this button commands the gearbox to only accelerate from 2nd gear and up, and not <b>to</b> <b>rev</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> too high, thus preventing any loss of traction.|$|E
50|$|Early on {{the night}} of 14 July 2001 the young backpackers were {{travelling}} on the Stuart Highway near Barrow Creek, in the Northern Territory, in their orange Kombi. Falconio was driving and Lees was next to him in the passenger seat. The two had been conscious of the headlights of a car behind them for some time, and were waiting to be overtaken. However, when the vehicle - a white, four wheel drive utility - drew alongside, the man in the cab, Murdoch, gestured at them to pull over. Falconio stopped the van and went to speak with the man, who pulled off the road ahead of them. The man explained he had seen sparks shooting out of the van's exhaust. The two went {{to the rear of the}} vehicle to investigate, and Lees slid into the drivers seat, ready <b>to</b> <b>rev</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> She then heard a loud bang from the rear of the van and, moments later, turned to the window. Instead of the night sky, the man filled it, with a silver gun in his hand. He climbed into the van, threatening her with the gun, as she backed away from him. She let him secure her hand behind her back with cable ties. She was forced out of the van landing on her knees on the gravel and falling to her face on the ground, but she escaped while he was distracted (apparently while moving Falconio's body). She hid for five hours in nearby bushes before running out onto the road and flagging down a truck driver who removed her cable ties and took her to safety at Barrow Creek Hotel from where the police were called.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Traditional' engine {{capacities}} of 750 cc {{and even the}} original 650 cc were considered before 790 cc was chosen. The 86 mm bore size worked well with the four-valves per cylinder layout, while the 68 mm stroke allowed a long conrod that helps to minimise secondary vibration, although Triumph engineers also altered the bar weights to restore a little 'character' vibration. Designer David Stride was able to add details that retained {{the look of the}} original, such as a finned cylinder and dummy pushrod tube (which functions as a cylinder head oil breather) and internal oil lines to create a clean appearance. As well as the desired low and midrange performance, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> is capable of 115 mph and produces a respectable peak power output of [...] @ 7400 rpm, with maximum torque of [...] @ 3500 rpm, with 90% of <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> torque output available from 2750 rpm all <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rev</b> limit. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> was air-cooled like the original, but had twin overhead camshafts instead of the old model's pushrod valve operation. A frame mounted oil cooler ensured consistent running temperatures and camshaft drive is by chain between the cylinders and incorporates an idler gear that allowed the cylinder head to be kept very compact.|$|R
50|$|Another {{significant}} {{departure from}} previous designs {{was the use}} of twin centrifugal rather than Roots-type superchargers, developed by Rolls-Royce based on the units used on later versions of <b>the</b> Merlin aero <b>engine.</b> This was to prove one of the car's main shortcomings, as while it allowed for tremendous power at high <b>revs</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> produced significantly less power lower down <b>the</b> <b>rev</b> range meaning drivers were constantly struggling <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> <b>revs</b> within a very small power band.|$|R

50|$|It {{also means}} that the torque and power curves of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> are unusual. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> {{produces}} peak torque and almost maximum power at a relatively low RPM, and from there <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rev</b> limiter <b>the</b> torque drops and the power does not increase much.|$|R
5000|$|A 1959 {{review by}} Road & Track commented that smooth upshifts of the widely spaced 3-speed manual {{required}} <b>revving</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> over 5000 rpm or slipping the clutch. Saab provided a retrofit kit which leaned out the fuel mixture in the carburettor, making the car more tractable at low revs but seriously impacting performance. The magazine also tried a modified GT with , which improved acceleration to 60 mi/h km/h from 15.2 seconds (in the [...] GT) to 12 flat. For comparison, an unmodified 93B required 27.2 seconds.|$|R
