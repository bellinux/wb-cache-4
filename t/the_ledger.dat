5|$|In 2006, a {{researcher}} in Devon discovered {{a list of}} ingredients for a pasty tucked inside an audit book and dated 1510, calculating the cost of making a venison pasty. This replaced the previous oldest recipe, dated 1746, held by the Cornwall Records Office in Truro, Cornwall. The dish {{at the time was}} cooked with venison, in this case from the Mount Edgcumbe estate, as the pasty was then considered a luxury meal. Alongside <b>the</b> <b>ledger,</b> which included the price of the pasty in Plymouth, Devon, in 1509, the discovery sparked a controversy between the neighbouring counties of Devon and Cornwall as to the origin of the dish. However, the term pasty appears in much earlier written records {{from other parts of the}} country, as mentioned above.|$|E

50|$|Historically, <b>the</b> {{purchase}} <b>ledger</b> {{was maintained}} in book form, hence <b>the</b> term <b>ledger,</b> but in modern practice {{it is much}} more likely to be held on computer using accountancy software or a spreadsheet.

For convenience the main Trial Balance lists some accounts containing many entries as simply a single control figure. There is then a separate physical <b>Ledger</b> for <b>the</b> summarised area, which could conveniently be managed on its own, often at physically separate locations from <b>the</b> main <b>ledger</b> book. <b>The</b> Purchase <b>Ledger</b> is a common example of this.|$|R
