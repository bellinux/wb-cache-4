5|$|On {{his last}} day, after oversleeping, Homer {{attempts}} {{to do all}} the <b>things</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> list. He has a man-to-man talk with Bart, listens to Lisa play her saxophone, and borrows Ned's camcorder to make a video for Maggie that she can look at when she is older. Next, Homer reconciles with his father Grampa, which takes up far more time than he expects and forces him to give up doing some of the <b>things</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> list. After trying to catch up on time he lost doing these things, Homer is arrested for speeding. He calls Barney, who is asked to pay $50 to bail him out. After being acquitted, he tells off his boss Mr. Burns and has one last drink at Moe's Tavern with his friends, causing him to miss dinner with his waiting family. He then hurries home in time to say goodbye to his children and make love to Marge.|$|E
25|$|Goto and Nagumo {{once more}} {{assemble}} the original Section 2 members {{in an abandoned}} subway passage as they embark on a secret operation to apprehend Yukihito Tsuge, a former GSDF officer who planned the terrorist attacks as revenge {{for the failure of}} a UN peacekeeping operation in Cambodia back in 1999. With the threat of US intervention looming unless the government controls the situation, the team uses an old stretch of the Ginza Line to approach an artificial island Tsuge uses as his hideout. Goto also takes care of <b>things</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> end by facilitating the arrest of Shigeki Arakawa, a GSDF intelligence agent who is actually one of Tsuge's cohorts. After a fierce fight inside the artificial island's tunnel which results in flooding, the team evacuates the tunnel while Nagumo breaks through to finally arrest Tsuge.|$|E
25|$|William VI did not {{immediately}} react to this setback; he had other <b>things</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind, being {{at war with the}} Duke of Guelders as he was, and receiving messages of the raids his Hoek enemy William, Lord of Arkel was making on his territories all the time. So in June 1411 he made a truce with the Frisians, which was renewed in the following month. When he began organising a campaign for the middle of August, the Frisians became somewhat more accommodating, and a three-year truce could be negotiated, and the campaign was called off. Under the terms of this truce Hollandic merchants got access to coastal towns and villages in Oostergo and Westergo from Dokkum in the northeast all the way around to Lemmer in the southeast; the Vetkoper refugees were allowed to return home; and William VI was awarded a large sum of money.|$|E

25|$|Although Angie {{tries to}} stop drinking, her {{attempts}} always fail dismally {{and by the}} end of the year she is arrested for drink-driving when she crashes Den's car on the way home from a darts match. In episodes broadcast in 1986, Den's mistress, Jan, starts to frequent The Queen Vic. The physical arrival of Jan sends Angie's marriage into further decline as she is unable to contain her jealousy and anger. Angie becomes so depressed that she takes a near lethal cocktail of booze and pills in an attempted suicide. By chance, Den returns home early following an argument with Jan, discovers Angie and rushes her to the hospital where she has her stomach pumped. Angie recovers, but is left shaken when she discovers how close to death she actually came. Upon recovering, Angie decides to play Den at his own game and so she begins another affair with Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson). Den is furious when he discovers them in bed together, but his rage is short-lived as he has more pressing <b>things</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind, such as the birth of his illegitimate daughter, Vicki Fowler (Emma Herry). Angie's affair with Andy only lasts a month, ending when Andy reunites with his ex-girlfriend Debbie Wilkins (Shirley Cheriton). Andy dies in a road accident shortly afterwards.|$|E
500|$|In The Slave Community, Blassingame {{argues that}} [...] "historians have never {{systematically}} explored the life experiences of American slaves." [...] He asserts that {{by concentrating on}} the slaveowner, historians have presented a distorted view of plantation life that [...] "strips the slave of any meaningful and distinctive culture, family life, religion, or manhood." [...] Blassingame outlines that the reliance on planter sources led historians like Elkins to mimic planter stereotypes of slaves such as the [...] "submissive half-man, half child" [...] Sambo. Noting the agency slaves possessed over their lives, he contends, [...] "Rather than identifying with and submitting totally to his master, the slave held onto many remnants of his African culture, gained a sense of worth in the quarters, {{spent most of his}} time free from surveillance by whites, controlled important aspects of his life, and did some personally meaningful <b>things</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own volition." ...|$|E
500|$|In the World Championship, O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Craig Steadman 10–3 in {{the first}} round and Matthew Stevens 13–5 in the second round, but suffered a surprise 9–13 defeat to Stuart Bingham in the quarter-finals. O'Sullivan was involved in many incidents during the tournament. While playing Steadman, he breached snooker's dress code when he removed a pair of uncomfortable shoes and played briefly in his socks, before borrowing shoes from tournament director Mike Ganley. In his match with Stevens, frustrated at missing a shot, he almost snapped his cue in half by hitting it against the table. In his quarter-final match, O'Sullivan placed his chalk on the table and used it to line up a shot. Controversially, referee Terry Camilleri did not penalize him for the incident, even though many commentators, including former world champion Ken Doherty and former tour referee Michaela Tabb, argued that under the rules of snooker the referee should have called a 7-point foul. These incidents led Stephen Hendry to say that O'Sullivan was not fully focused. [...] "Personally I think it is a sign he has got other <b>things</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind," [...] said Hendry. [...] "He is not focused properly on winning the World Championship." ...|$|E

500|$|One of Darren's {{earliest}} storylines saw him {{and friend}} Luke Morgan (Gary Lucy) stand up to bully Mark Gibbs (Colin Parry). Darren becomes friends with Mark {{in an attempt to}} deter Mark's bullying but Mark soon after rapes Luke. Darren takes advantage of the situation and begins a relationship with Luke's girlfriend Mandy Richardson (Sarah Jayne Dunn). Dawson commented on this saying, [...] "Darren liked Mandy even before he went to America so he was gutted when he came back to discover she had started going out with Luke. And all along, Luke knew that Darren wanted to get together with Mandy ... Luke has other <b>things</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind and seems to be ignoring Mandy, so Darren thinks it is the perfect opportunity to make his move". Before Darren asks Mandy out he confronts Luke who [...] "gives him the green light". Dawson opined that although viewers may think Mandy and Darren are being [...] "heartless" [...] they don't know about Luke's attack so are not to blame. Dawson felt that initially the relationship is a [...] "flirty kind of friendship" [...] although Mandy realises she likes Darren and plans to use Darren as a means of reuniting with Luke. As Darren and Mandy spend more time together their relationship [...] "develops". If Darren were to find out about Luke's rape, Dawson felt Darren would help Luke get [...] "revenge" [...] on Mark. He said Mandy would either be [...] "shocked and turn to Darren for support" [...] or [...] "feel guilty about what she's done" [...] and reunite with Luke. Dawson felt if this were to happen Darren would [...] "try to shrug it off" [...] although [...] "deep down, he cares for Mandy". Dawson felt that Darren should become a [...] "hero" [...] to Luke, fixing all his problems which would rectify him beginning a relationship with Mandy.|$|E

2500|$|He was {{specifically}} accused of injecting inmates with malaria-infected blood, {{and with a}} serum that caused rheumatism; however, many former prisoners testified in support of Münch in their witness speeches. The court acquitted him on 22 December 1947, [...] "not only {{because he did not}} commit any crime of harm against the camp prisoners, but because he had a benevolent attitude toward them and helped them, while he had to carry the responsibility. He did this independently from the nationality, race-and-religious origin and political conviction of the prisoners." [...] The court's acquittal was based, among other <b>things,</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> strict refusal to participate in the selections.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} symbols in Our Mutual Friend {{is that of the}} River Thames, and the river is linked to major themes of the novel, rebirth and renewal. Water is seen as a sign of new life, and associated by the Christian Church with the sacrament of Baptism. Characters like John Harmon and Eugene Wrayburn end up in the waters of the river, and come out reborn as new men. Wrayburn emerges from the river on his deathbed, but is ready to marry Lizzie to save her reputation. [...] He surprises everyone, including himself, when he survives and goes on to have a loving marriage with Lizzie. John Harmon also appears to end up in the river through no fault of his own, and when Gaffer pulls his [...] "body" [...] out of the waters, he adopts the alias of John Rokesmith. This alias is for his own safety and peace of mind; he wants to know that he can do <b>things</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own, and does not need his father's name or money to make a good life for himself.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, Drummond bought A Smell of Sulphur in the Wind by Richard Long, for $20,000. In Drummond’s own words, he ‘fell in {{love with}} Richard Long’s work because’ [...] "it was art by walking and doing <b>things</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> walks." [...] Five years later, Drummond {{felt that he was}} no longer [...] "getting his money's worth" [...] from the photograph. [...] He decided to try to sell it by placing a series of {{placards}} around the country. When this failed to result in its sale, in 2001 he cut the photograph and mounting card into 20,000 pieces to sell for $1 each. His plan, upon retrieving the $20,000 in cash, is to walk with it to the remote place in Iceland where Richard Long had made the photograph and bury it in a box beneath the stone circle. He will then take his own photograph of the site, bring it home, frame it, hang it in the same place in his bedroom where the Richard Long hung, and call the new work The Smell of Money Underground. Drummond's books How to be an Artist and a later soft-bound edition titled $20,000 recounts this story.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Prime Suspect," [...] Charlie {{purchases}} {{the beautiful}} Craftsman family {{home from his}} father, who continues to live with him. Now 30 years old, Charlie wants to be responsible {{and take care of}} his father but still believes that much of the pressures involving their dad has been put on his shoulders as Don doesn't seem to have enough time. Realizing this, Alan sets his sights on moving out to accomplish <b>things</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own, with Charlie seemingly supporting the idea, but has since chosen to stay as he favors his son's company. Recently, Charlie is bothered by his father trying to impose his will on him with maintaining the house, as he is a full tenured professor at one of the most prestigious institutions in the country working on [...] "life-altering" [...] mathematics, i.e., in solving crimes. Alan just wants him to be responsible and not end up like Larry, though Mr. Eppes respects Fleinhardt. Even he has thought of this possibility and decides to do more around the home. After Charlie compares his own situation to that of Einstein his father looks into information on the physicist and understands his son's predicament. Charlie also feels guilty about the amount of time his parents, particularly his mother, who always was attuned to his way of thinking, spent with him as a child; he even asks his mother (JoBeth Williams) in a dream if she regrets the time away from Don and Alan because of the special attention he needed growing up.|$|E
60|$|When Peter Rabbit, {{reaching}} up to nibble {{the bark of}} one of Farmer Brown's young trees, felt something tugging {{at one of his}} hind legs, he was so startled that he jumped to get away. Instead of doing this, he fell flat <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face. The <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> hind leg had tightened and held him fast. A great fear came to Peter Rabbit, and lying there in the snow, he kicked and struggled with all his might. But the more he kicked, the tighter grew that hateful <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> leg! Finally he grew too tired to kick any more and lay still. The dreadful thing that held him hurt his leg, but it didn't pull when he lay still.|$|R

2500|$|Kat {{previously}} {{cheated on}} Alfie with Michael and Michael {{is the father}} of Kat's child Tommy. Kat chose to stay with Alfie, but Inside Soap said there seemed to be [...] "unfinished business" [...] between Kat and Michael. Michael has a baby with his new wife, millionaire businesswoman Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), and the magazine wondered if Michael would turn to Kat if things go badly at their wedding. They also thought that Michael still has feelings for Kat, but wondered if he would actually cheat on Janine. They called him [...] "a nasty bit of work" [...] but thought that starting an affair when his newborn baby, Scarlett Moon, is ill in hospital would [...] "really take the biscuit." [...] They said the characters are drawn to each other and Kat hates Janine, but an affair would not be shocking enough as they have already had a relationship. Brooks is leaving the cast in 2012 for an extended break, so Soaplife said that something will happen to break Michael and Janine up, but thought an affair with Kat would be [...] "too much been-there-done-that to be equal to as big a reveal as 'Who Shot Phil?'." [...] They later said that Michael would not risk Janine's fortune by cheating. All About Soap thought Michael was the least likely suspect, as he has other <b>things</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind, although Kat [...] "shows a softer side" [...] to Michael when she gives him some baby clothes, but said that Kat hates Michael, [...] "which could prove a problem in the romance department." [...] They also said Michael [...] "has a first-class degree in lying." ...|$|E
