5|$|A {{recurring}} plot {{element is}} {{the depiction of}} Kyle as insecure about Jewish traditions and beliefs. Already regarding God as cruel for allowing him to suffer from a life-threatening hemorrhoid while Cartman enjoys a million-dollar inheritance, Kyle became further appalled after being read the story of Job. He also once feared damnation for not having grown up as a Catholic. During both instances, he renounced his affiliation with Judaism, only to have his faith restored by events occurring {{at the end of}} an episode. After watching The Passion of the Christ, a shameful Kyle suddenly felt that Cartman's anti-Semitism was justified, and suggested to angry members of his synagogue that the Jews apologize for <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus.</b> Kyle's guilt is alleviated when he encounters Mel Gibson, the film's director, and perceives him to be a deranged masochist.|$|E
5|$|King {{told the}} International Congress of Coptic Studies {{that the text}} does not prove that Jesus had a wife. She noted that even as a {{translation}} of a 2nd-century AD Greek text, it would still have been written more than 100 years after <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus.</b> According to King, the earliest and most reliable information about Jesus is silent {{on the question of}} his marital status. King also said that the text (which she suggested is a fragment from a non-canonical gospel) showed that some early Christians believed that Jesus was married. A Harvard News Office article reported that King dated the speculative Greek original to {{the second half of the}} second century because it shows close connections to other newly discovered gospels written at that time, particularly the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Mary, and the Gospel of Philip.|$|E

25|$|Using these methods, most {{scholars}} assume a {{date of birth}} between 6 and 4BC, and that Jesus' preaching began around AD2729 and lasted one to three years. They calculate <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> as having taken place between AD30 and 36.|$|E

50|$|Another {{example is}} the episode she wrote on February 28, 1946. It reports that in {{preparation}} for his Passion, Jesus visited the town of Kerioth to say farewell and performed a miracle, curing Anne of Kerioth on her deathbed. In this episode Jesus instructs the cured Anne of Kerioth to forever tend to and comfort Mary of Simon, the mother of Judas Iscariot who will be heartbroken upon the betrayal by her son and <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> and Judas in the near future.|$|R
25|$|The {{hypothetical}} Q source, {{widely considered}} by scholars to be {{a collection of}} sayings of Jesus used, {{in addition to the}} Gospel of Mark, by the authors of the Luke and Matthew Gospels, contains no predictions of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Eventually, it was settled, and Ghulam Ahmad {{travelled}} to the Jama Masjid Delhi (main mosque) of Delhi {{accompanied by}} twelve of his followers, where some 5,000people were gathered. Before the debate started, {{there was a}} discussion on the conditions, {{which led to the}} conclusion that the debate should not be upon <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus,</b> but upon the claims of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. He explained that his claim could only be discussed after <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> was proven, for Jesus was considered by many to be living and the one who will descend to Earth himself. Only when this belief was refuted could his claim to be the Messiah be discussed.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{time for}} {{religious}} observance is Holy Week or Semana Santa. In Puebla, {{there is the}} Procession del Silencio or Procession of Silence which occurs on Maundy Thursday, when the city observes a period of silence to mark <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus.</b>|$|E

25|$|Various books, memoirs {{and stories}} were written about Jesus {{by the early}} Christians. The most famous are the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. All but one of these are {{believed}} to have been written within 50–70 years of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus,</b> with the Gospel of Mark believed to be the earliest, and the last the Gospel of John. Blainey writes that the oldest surviving record written by an early Christian is a short letter by St Paul: the First Epistle to the Thessalonians, which appeared about 25 years after <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus.</b> This letter, while important in describing issues for the development of Gentilic Christianity, contains little of significance for understanding the life of the historic Jesus.|$|E
25|$|The gospels and Christian {{tradition}} depict Jesus {{as being}} executed at {{the insistence of}} Jewish leaders, who considered his claims to divinity to be blasphemous.

25|$|The {{estimation}} of the hour of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> based on the New Testament accounts {{has been the subject}} of debate among scholars for centuries, since there was perceived to be a clear difference between the accounts in the Synoptic Gospels and that in the Gospel of John.|$|E

25|$|A common Christian {{interpretation}} {{is that this}} parable was about the chief priests and Pharisees and {{was given to the}} people present in Temple in Jerusalem during the final week before <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus.</b> Muslim interpreters of the Bible considered this parable a prophecy of the advent of Muhammad.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{theories}} {{to explain the}} circumstances of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> on the cross have been proposed by physicians and Biblical scholars.

25|$|The seven undisputed Pauline epistles {{considered}} by scholarly consensus to be genuine epistles are generally dated to 50–60 AD (i.e. approximately twenty to {{thirty years after}} the generally accepted time period for <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> around 30–36 AD) and are the earliest surviving Christian texts that may include information about Jesus.|$|E

25|$|Other {{approaches}} to the chronology of Jesus have been suggested over the centuries, e.g. Maximus the Confessor, Eusebius, and Cassiodorus asserted that <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> occurred in AD31. The 3rd/4th century Roman historian Lactantius states that Jesus was crucified on a particular day in AD29, {{but that did not}} correspond to a full moon.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} to estimating an upper {{bound for the}} year of death of Jesus is the estimation of the date of conversion of Paul the Apostle which the New Testament accounts place some time after <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus.</b> Paul's conversion is discussed in both the Letters of Paul and in the Acts of the Apostles.|$|E
25|$|In {{common with}} other Restorationist churches, the LDS Church teaches that a Great Apostasy occurred. It teaches that after <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> and the Twelve Apostles, the priesthood {{authority}} was lost and some important doctrinal teachings, including {{the text of}} the Bible, were changed from their original form, thus necessitating a restoration prior to the Second Coming. That restoration, according to church doctrine, began during the life of Joseph Smith.|$|E
5000|$|Conflicted, Judas {{seeks out}} the priests and {{promises}} to help them arrest Jesus, while belaboring that he is acting with unselfish motives and that Jesus himself would approve if he knew those motives; he bids the priests not declare him damned. Caiaphas demands that Judas reveal the location <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> so that the authorities can apprehend him. In exchange for the information, Judas is offered money as a [...] "fee" [...] {{so that he can}} assuage his conscience by using the money charitably ("Damned for All Time/Blood Money"). Judas decides {{that it would be better}} to turn Jesus in before his popularity leads to <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> and his followers, Judas included.
