50|$|Serious chronic {{illnesses}} may produce dwarfism {{as a side}} effect. Harsh environmental conditions, such as malnutrition, may also produce dwarfism. These types of dwarfism are indirect consequences of the generally unhealthy or malnourished condition of the individual, and not of any specific disease. The dwarfism often {{takes the form of}} simple short stature, without any deformities, thus leading <b>to</b> <b>proportionate</b> dwarfism. In societies where poor nutrition is widespread, the average height of the population may be reduced below its genetic potential by the lack of proper nutrition. Sometimes there is no definitive cause of short stature.|$|E
50|$|The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 made it {{much more}} {{difficult}} for a plaintiff to bring suit successfully against a company’s auditors. While the act did codify as law the reporting requirements of SAS 59, it also made it more difficult for a plaintiff’s attorneys to successfully pursue class-action litigation against auditors. Furthermore, in cases where auditors did fail to modify their audit opinions in accordance with SAS 59, the damage awards were limited <b>to</b> <b>proportionate</b> liability. When comparing the potential costs of issuing a going-concern opinion (hastening the demise of the client; losing audit fees) to the costs of not issuing a going-concern opinion (litigation), the result of the act was essentially to tip the scales in favor of not issuing a going-concern opinion. Since the act was passed, high-profile litigation citing the auditors’ failure to issue a going-concern opinion, such as the class-action lawsuits by Kmart’s shareholders against PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Adelphia’s against Deloitte & Touche, has been drastically reduced.|$|E

50|$|Since 2001, Mahendra Chaudhry {{has survived}} a {{leadership}} challenge and has rebuilt the Labour Party. In recent times, it has won several key byelections, and appears well-placed {{to mount a}} credible challenge to the Qarase government in 2006. Chaudhry's strained relationship with Prime Minister Qarase has prevented the Labour Party from being represented in the Cabinet, despite the constitutional stipulation that any political party with more than eight seats in the House of Representatives is entitled <b>to</b> <b>proportionate</b> representation in the Cabinet. On 18 July 2003 the Supreme Court of Fiji ruled that Qarase's exclusion of the Labour Party breached the constitution, and demanded that the situation be rectified. Negotiations, appeals, and counter-appeals followed, which delayed the appointment of Labour Party ministers. In June 2004, the Supreme Court ruled that the Labour Party was entitled to 14 out of 30 Cabinet posts. Qarase {{announced that he would}} accept and implement the order, but his refusal to include Chaudhry himself in any cabinet line-up continued to stall negotiations about the composition of the cabinet, until Chaudhry announced towards the end of 2004 that the Labour Party was no longer interested in joining the government, and would remain in opposition {{for the remainder of the}} parliamentary term.|$|E
50|$|The {{main points}} of this {{argument}} can be summarised as follows:*a mass of evidence indicating that reductions in hours of work had not led <b>to</b> <b>proportionate</b> declines in output;*modern industry fatigue was less physical in nature and more a combination of psychological and physiological {{as a result of}} specialisation and increased need for mental concentration;*the reduction of hours allowed better-rested workers to produce as much or more in the shorter hours;*the total value of the output would initially rise as the working day increased but eventually the total output as well as the output per hour would decline as the working day became so long that it prevented adequate recovery from fatigue for workers;*this is the case because, beyond a certain point, each additional hour of work would be contributing to the output of the current day's total output but {{at the expense of the}} following day's output capacity; and*the intensity of the work involved would dictate the point at which total output begins to fall and thus the length of the 'optimal' working day.The second half {{of this argument}} explores whether the free market can arrive at the 'optimal' length of day, and can be summarised as follows:*the maintenance of a long-term optimum by employers would require short-term restraint;*each individual employer could never be certain of reaping the benefit of their restraint as another firm could potentially entice the employer's well-rested workers away with a wage premium;*therefore the optimal output work time is a form of investment without equity;*simultaneously, Chapman (1909) assumed that workers would choose a longer working day than was prudent (although not as long as the working day preferred by employers), primarily because of a general short-sightedness that would mean workers would consider their immediate earning capacity more than their longterm earning capacity; and*the outcome in a free market situation would therefore be one where employers and employees acting in self-interest would each tend to select a working day that was longer than the 'optimal' hours.Chapman (1909) considered three elements in gauging the optimal day for the worker; # the wage, # the marginal value of leisure and # the disutility of work.|$|E

40|$|Nerve {{conduction}} in unmyelinated fibers {{has long}} been described based on the equivalent circuit model and cable theory. However, without the change in ionic concentration gradient across the membrane, {{there would be no}} generation or propagation of the action potential. Based on this concept, we employ a new conductive model focusing on the distribution of voltage-gated sodium ion channels and Coulomb force between electrolytes. Based on this new model, the propagation of the nerve conduction was suggested to take place far before the generation of action potential at each channel. We theoretically showed that propagation of action potential, which is enabled by the increasing Coulomb force produced by inflowing sodium ions, from one sodium ion channel to the next sodium channel would be inversely <b>proportionate</b> <b>to</b> the density of sodium channels on the axon membrane. Because the longitudinal number of sodium ion channel would be <b>proportionate</b> <b>to</b> the square root of channel density, the conduction velocity of unmyelinated nerves is theoretically shown <b>to</b> be <b>proportionate</b> <b>to</b> the square root of channel density. Also, from a viewpoint of equilibrium state of channel importation and degeneration, channel density was suggested <b>to</b> be <b>proportionate</b> <b>to</b> axonal diameter. Based on these simple basis, conduction velocity in unmyelinated nerves was theoretically shown <b>to</b> be <b>proportionate</b> <b>to</b> the square root of axonal diameter. This new model would also enable us to acquire more accurate and understandable vision on the phenomena in unmyelinated nerves in addition to the conventional electric circuit model and cable theory...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Although it {{is known}} from GA {{literature}} that proportionate selection is subject to many pitfalls, the LCS community somewhat adhered <b>to</b> <b>proportionate</b> selection. Also in the accuracy-based learning classifier system XCS, introduced by Wilson in 1995, proportionate selection is used. This paper identifies problem properties in which performance of proportionate selection is impaired. Consequently, tournament selection is introduced which makes XCS more parameter independent, noise independent, and more efficient in exploiting fitness guidance. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} type of jointly controlled entity influences the management choice to report interests {{in this kind of}} joint venture using the equity method or proportionate consolidation. We address this gap in the accounting choice literature by exploiting the UK setting where, due to the transition to IFRS, firms had to change their reporting method for interests in jointly controlled entities from the gross equity method to a similar approach (equity method) or <b>to</b> <b>proportionate</b> consolidation. We support our analysis on the classification of jointly controlled entities proposed by Hennart (1988). We hypothesize that venturers are more likely to change their reporting method <b>to</b> <b>proportionate</b> consolidation when the majority of their jointly controlled entities are cases of Link instead of Scale cooperation. After controlling for several variables, our results are consistent with the predictions and thus suggest that {{the type of}} jointly controlled entity {{plays an important role in}} the management decision to report interests in jointly controlled entities using the equity method or proportionate consolidation. However, the results also provide empirical evidence supporting the importance of debt covenant costs and monitoring costs in the choice between alternative reporting methods. 1...|$|E
