5|$|Following Syria's secession, Nasser grew {{concerned}} with Amer's inability {{to train and}} modernize the army, and with the state within a state Amer had created in the military command and intelligence apparatus. In late 1961, Nasser established the Presidential Council and decreed it the authority to approve all senior military appointments, instead of leaving this responsibility solely to Amer. Moreover, he instructed that the primary criterion for promotion should be merit and not personal loyalties. Nasser retracted the initiative after Amer's allies in the officers corps threatened <b>to</b> <b>mobilize</b> against him.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, marine {{biologist}} and ecologist Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring helped <b>to</b> <b>mobilize</b> {{the environmental movement}} by alerting the public to toxic pesticides, such as DDT, bioaccumulating in the environment.

He was joined there on July 29 by Brigadier General Henry Atkinson, who brought 500 men upriver by steamboat from Jefferson Barracks. Several days later, Henry Dodge arrived at Fort Crawford with 130 mounted militiamen, mostly miners. Governor Ninian Edwards of Illinois sent 600 mounted militiamen north to Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} methods of {{removing}} thallium (both radioactive and normal) from humans is to use Prussian blue, a material which absorbs thallium. Up to 20g per day of Prussian blue is fed by mouth to the person, and it passes through their digestive system and comes out in the stool. Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are also used to remove thallium from the blood serum. At later stage of the treatment additional potassium is used <b>to</b> <b>mobilize</b> thallium from the tissue.|$|E
5|$|After al-Ghazali's downfall, the Hubaysh clan, who {{had since}} been forced out by Qa'itbay {{and settled in}} Lassa, sought to oust Qa'itbay. They kidnapped Hasan's son Mansur, who Qa'itbay had spared from {{execution}} due to Qa'itbay's lack of male children, and organized a revolt against Qa'itbay in Mansur's name. The revolt quickly spread through Qa'itbay's territories, but after marshaling financial resources <b>to</b> <b>mobilize</b> military support from the Bedouin Ibn al-Hansh tribe of the Beqaa Valley, he managed to drive his opponents back to Lassa. Qa'itbay died without a male heir in 1523, and was succeeded by Hasan's son Mansur, who Qa'itbay had spared from execution due to Qa'itbay's lack of male children.|$|E

5|$|By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward {{appearances}} of calmness, {{had been in}} long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although {{it was able to}} put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258–60 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued. On the eve of the Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion. The crown's ability <b>to</b> <b>mobilize</b> defenses was in serious jeopardy.|$|E
5|$|De Grasse had {{notified}} {{his counterpart}} in Newport, the Comte de Barras Saint-Laurent, of his intentions and his planned arrival date. Barras sailed from Newport on 27 August with 8 ships of the line, 4 frigates, and 18 transports carrying French armaments and siege equipment. He deliberately sailed via a circuitous route {{in order to}} minimize the possibility of an encounter with the British, should they sail from New York in pursuit. Washington and Rochambeau, in the meantime, had crossed the Hudson on 24 August, leaving some troops behind as a ruse to delay any potential move on the part of General Clinton <b>to</b> <b>mobilize</b> assistance for Cornwallis.|$|E
5|$|Early {{proposals}} {{made by the}} National Capital Park and Planning Commission {{involved a}} route that followed US1 north to MD198, then east to Fort Meade, but lack of funding led to simpler plans to widen US 1 instead. During the 1930s, the New Deal programs promulgated by President Franklin Roosevelt led to a heightened awareness of the parkway proposals; a 1937 report by the Maryland State Planning Commission increased awareness further. Increasing accident levels on US 1 (which was {{called one of the}} deadliest roads in the world at the time) along with awareness of the need <b>to</b> <b>mobilize</b> national defense before World War II provided additional motivation for construction of the parkway.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his victory}} at Marj Ibn Amer, 4,000 locals, {{including}} many residents of Nazareth, joined Zahir's forces to completely subdue Jabal Nablus. Among Zahir's supporters were Christian women from Nazareth who supplied his troops {{with food and}} water. Zahir's forces pursued the Jarrars to their throne village of Sanur, but ultimately withdrew after failing to subdue the fortress. This defeat marked the limit of Zahir's influence south of Marj Ibn Amer and established the Jarrars as the dominant force of Jabal Nablus over their rivals, the Tuqans. While the Jarrars and Zahir eventually concluded a truce, the former continued <b>to</b> <b>mobilize</b> the clans of Jabal Nablus to prevent Zahir's southward expansion.|$|E
5|$|Indiana was {{the first}} of the country's western states <b>to</b> <b>mobilize</b> for the Civil War. When news reached Indiana of the attack on Fort Sumter, South Carolina, on April 12, 1861, many Indiana {{residents}} were surprised, but their response was immediate. On the following day, two mass meetings were held in Indianapolis, the state capital of Indiana, and the state's position was decided: Indiana would remain in the Union and would immediately contribute men to suppress the rebellion. On April 15, Indiana's governor, Oliver P. Morton, issued a call for volunteer soldiers to meet the state's quota set by President Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{defenses}} can {{be classified}} generally as constitutive or induced. Constitutive defenses are always present in the plant, while induced defenses are produced or mobilized to the site where a plant is injured. There is wide variation in the composition and concentration of constitutive defenses and these range from mechanical defenses to digestibility reducers and toxins. Many external mechanical defenses and large quantitative defenses are constitutive, as they require large amounts of resources to produce and are difficult <b>to</b> <b>mobilize.</b> A variety of molecular and biochemical approaches are {{used to determine the}} mechanism of constitutive and induced plant defenses responses against herbivory.|$|E

In June 1908, Zeballos {{presented a}} plan to the Argentine Congress where they would offer the Brazilian government a chance to give one of their two unfinished dreadnoughts to Argentina. This would allow the two countries a chance to enjoy relative naval parity. Should the Brazilians refuse, Zeballos planned to issue an ultimatum: {{if they did not}} comply in eight days, the mobilized Argentine Army would invade what the army and navy ministers claimed was a defenseless Rio de Janeiro. Unfortunately for Zeballos, his plan was leaked to the media, and the resulting public outcry—Argentine citizens happened to not be in favor of their government borrowing large sums of money <b>to</b> <b>mobilize</b> the army and go to war—ensured his resignation.|$|E

Following the Italian invasion of Abyssinia, the entire flotilla was sent to the Red Sea in August 1935 to monitor Italian warship movements until April 1936. Refitted upon their return, many were deployed to Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War in 1936–39 to intercept shipping carrying contraband goods to Spain and to protect British-flagged ships. While the F-class ships {{were assigned to}} the 6th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet, they followed much the same pattern as their E-class sisters. In April 1939 the 5th and 6th DFs were renumbered the 7th and 8th Destroyer Flotillas, respectively. In mid-1939, newly-commissioned J-class destroyers began to replace the E-class ships and they were reduced to reserve for lack of manpower. Increasing tensions with Nazi Germany in August, caused the British <b>to</b> <b>mobilize</b> the Navy's reserves, which allowed the ships to be manned again and assigned to the 12th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet.|$|E
