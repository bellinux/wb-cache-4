40|$|The {{work was}} {{oriented}} towards desing and realization of optical setup for investigation of dissociated molecules of ultra-pure iodine 127 I 2 throught laser spectroscopy methods. The absorption cell {{was equipped with}} special-design <b>thermostatic</b> <b>box</b> with possibility of precise control of thermal dissociation of absorption media atoms and molecules...|$|E
40|$|A {{schematic}} {{model is}} presented that {{allows one to}} study the behavior of interacting pseudo-Fermi matter locked in a <b>thermostatic</b> <b>box.</b> As {{a function of the}} box volume and temperature, the matter is seen to show all of the familiar charactersitics of a Van der Waals gas, which include the coexistence of two phases under certain circumstances and the presence of a critical point...|$|E
