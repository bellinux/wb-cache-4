50|$|Benjamin Morgan, {{originally}} from Philadelphia {{and of a}} prominent American Revolutionary War family, purchased the land in 1804.

50|$|In {{all cases}} the {{anisotropic}} material, for example, a thermosetting resin containing conductive particles, is first deposited {{on the base}} substrate. This may be done using a lamination process for ACF, or either a dispense or printing process for ACP. The device or secondary substrate is then placed in position over the base substrate and {{the two sides are}} pressed together to mount the secondary substrate or device to the base substrate. In many cases this mounting process is done with no heat or a minimal amount of heat that is just sufficient to cause the anisotropic material to become slightly tacky. In the case of using a thermosetting resin containing conductive particles, the particles are trapped between prominent points, such as electrodes, between the substrate and the component, thereby creating an electrical connection <b>therebetween.</b> Other particles are insulated by the thermosetting resin. In some cases this mounting step is skipped and the two sides go directly to the bonding portion of the process. In high volume manufacturing, however, this would lead to inefficiencies in the manufacturing process, so direct bonding is usually done only in the lab or in small scale manufacturing.|$|E
