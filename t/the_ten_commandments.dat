5|$|As a legislator, Beshear {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a consumer advocate, and sponsored bills to increase environmental protections and end the practice of commercial bail bonding. In 1974, Beshear voted against a resolution condemning the practice of desegregation busing because it called for changes to the federal constitution. One of his major accomplishments in the House was spearheading legislation to improve neonatal care at the University of Kentucky Medical Center. Although he considered a 1978 bill requiring the posting of <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> <b>Commandments</b> in Kentucky classrooms to be unconstitutional, he abstained from voting on it rather than voting against it, a move he later claimed he regretted.|$|E

5|$|At an {{ecclesiastical council}} held at Lambeth in 1281, Peckham ordered the clergy to {{instruct}} their congregations in doctrine {{at least four}} times a year. They were to explain and teach the Articles of Faith, <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> <b>Commandments,</b> the Works of Mercy, the Seven Deadly Sins, the Seven Virtues and the Sacraments. This command was issued as a canon, or law, of the council, and the group is known as the Lambeth Constitutions. Even later these constitutions were collected as the Ignorantia sacerdotum. The six doctrines comprised the minimum theological knowledge the archbishop considered necessary for the laity to know. The constitutions, which were originally in Latin, were the basis and inspiration for pastoral and devotional works throughout the remainder of the Middle Ages, and were eventually translated into English in the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|On March 28, 1978, Paramount {{assembled}} the largest press conference {{held at the}} studio since Cecil B. DeMille announced he was making <b>The</b> <b>Ten</b> <b>Commandments.</b> Eisner announced that Academy-Award winning director Robert Wise would direct a film adaptation of the television series, titled Star Trek—The Motion Picture. Wise had only seen a few Star Trek episodes, so Paramount gave him about a dozen to watch. The budget was projected at $15million. Dennis Clark (Comes a Horseman) was invited to rewrite the script and to include Spock, but he disliked Roddenberry, who demanded sole credit. Livingston returned as writer, and although he also found Roddenberry unreasonable, Wise and Katzenberg convinced him to continue rewriting the script throughout production.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ten</b> <b>Commandments</b> are {{a series}} of {{religious}} and moral imperatives that are recognized as a moral foundation in several of the Abrahamic religions, including Catholicism. As described in the Old Testament books Exodus and Deuteronomy, the Commandments form part of a covenant offered by God to the Israelites to free them from the spiritual slavery of sin. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church—the official exposition of the Catholic Church's Christian beliefs—the Commandments are considered essential for spiritual good health and growth, and {{serve as the basis for}} Catholic social justice. A review of the Commandments is one of the most common types of examination of conscience used by Catholics before receiving the sacrament of Penance.|$|E

5|$|Two minor controversies marked Beshear's {{tenure as}} {{attorney}} general. The {{first came in}} the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in the 1980 case of Stone v. Graham. The ruling struck down the state law requiring the posting of <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> <b>Commandments</b> in all of the state's classrooms on grounds that it violated the Establishment Clause of the federal constitution. State Superintendent Raymond Barber asked the Supreme Court to clarify whether its ruling meant that all of the copies of the Commandments already posted had to be taken down or whether it simply invalidated the Kentucky requirement for them to be posted; the Court refused the request for clarification. Beshear then issued an advisory opinion that displaying the Commandments in classrooms under any circumstances was banned by the Court's ruling.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the University of Kentucky College of Law in 1968, Beshear briefly practiced law in New York before {{returning}} to Kentucky and being elected to the state legislature, where he gained {{a reputation as a}} consumer advocate. He parlayed that reputation into a term as attorney general, serving under Governor John Y. Brown, Jr. As attorney general, Beshear issued an opinion that copies of <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> <b>Commandments</b> would have to be removed from the walls of the state's classrooms {{in the wake of the}} U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Stone v. Graham. He also clashed with first lady Phyllis George Brown when he opposed the practice of charging an admission fee for visitors to view the renovated governor's mansion. In 1983, Beshear was elected lieutenant governor in the administration of Governor Martha Layne Collins. His most significant action in this capacity was the formation of the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a panel charged with making recommendations for the future of the state.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, the consent decree of 1948 forcing film studios to divest {{themselves}} of theater chains and the competitive pressure of television had caused significant financial distress at MGM. In a gamble {{to save the}} studio, and inspired {{by the success of}} Paramount Pictures' 1956 Biblical epic <b>The</b> <b>Ten</b> <b>Commandments,</b> studio head Joseph Vogel announced in 1957 that MGM would again move forward on a remake of Ben-Hur. Filming started in May 1958 and wrapped in January 1959, and post-production took six months. Although the budget for Ben-Hur was initially $7 million, it was reported to be $10 million by February 1958, reaching $15.175 million by the time shooting began—making it the costliest film ever produced up to that time. When adjusted for inflation, the budget of Ben Hur was approximately $ in constant dollars.|$|E

5|$|Cameron and Comfort {{participated in}} a {{televised}} debate with atheists Brian Sapient and Kelly O'Conner of the Rational Response Squad, at Calvary Baptist Church, in Manhattan, on May 5, 2007. It was moderated by ABC's Martin Bashir and parts of it were aired on Nightline. At issue was the existence of God, which Comfort stated he could prove scientifically, without relying on faith or the Bible. The audience was composed of both theists and atheists. Points of discussion included atheism and evolution. While Sapient contended during his arguments that Comfort violated the rules by talking about <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> <b>Commandments,</b> Cameron later stated on The Way of the Master radio show that {{the rules of the}} debate did not say that the Bible could never be referenced, but rather that Comfort simply {{had to come up with}} one argument that did not reference the Bible or faith.|$|E
5|$|For {{the civilians}} of San Francisco, Fletcher {{decided on a}} greater freedom in dress. Much of the {{materials}} for these casual clothes {{were found in the}} old storerooms at Paramount, where a large amount of unused or forgotten silks, crepes, and leathers lay in storage. One bolt of material had been handpicked by Cecil DeMille in 1939, and was in perfect condition. The red, black, and gold brocade was woven with real gold and silver wrapped around silk thread; the resulting costume was used for a Betelgeusean ambassador and, at a price of $10,000 for the fabric alone, was the most expensive costume ever worn by a Hollywood extra. Fletcher also recycled suedes from <b>The</b> <b>Ten</b> <b>Commandments</b> for the Zaranite costumes. With the approval of Roddenberry, Fletcher fashioned complete backgrounds for the alien races seen in the Earth and recreation deck sequences, describing their appearances and the composition of their costumes.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, a new Greek Revival {{octagonal}} synagogue {{designed by}} architect P.J. Krouse and modelled after the Temple of Athena Nike was {{built at the}} corner of 11th Street and 24th Avenue. The marble steps leading to the entrance of the building were flanked by large Ionic columns. The new synagogue could seat 500 and featured stained glass windows displaying <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> <b>Commandments,</b> a menorah, the Star of David, and Noah's Ark. A fire damaged the building during its first year of operation, and while it was being repaired, services were held at St. Paul's Episcopal Church. By 1907, the congregation had grown to include 82 members and was led by Rabbi Max Raisin. By 1927, the Jewish community in Meridian had grown to 525 people, partly due to an influx of immigrants from Eastern Europe. The members of Beth Israel sponsored these newcomers, helping them to find jobs and homes and holding night classes to teach them English.|$|E
