5|$|The Debian {{project has}} {{an influx of}} {{applicants}} wishing to become developers. These applicants must undergo a vetting process which establishes their identity, motivation, understanding of the project's principles, and technical competence. <b>This</b> <b>process</b> <b>has</b> become much harder throughout the years.|$|E
5|$|Heated-{{manifold}} direct-injection die casting, {{also known}} as direct-injection die casting or runnerless die casting, is a zinc die casting process where molten zinc is forced through a heated manifold and then through heated mini-nozzles, which lead into the molding cavity. <b>This</b> <b>process</b> <b>has</b> the advantages of lower cost per part, through the reduction of scrap (by the elimination of sprues, gates and runners) and energy conservation, and better surface quality through slower cooling cycles.|$|E
5|$|Incinerating waste has {{traditionally}} been viewed as a method with the main purpose being {{the destruction of the}} waste involved. Recovering the energy generated from <b>this</b> <b>process</b> <b>has</b> become of greater importance, and all incineration facilities in England now operate as energy-from-waste plants (with many operating as combined heat and power facilities). Critics question the safety of the pollutants emitted during the process and argue that, as incinerators require constant levels of waste to operate, it encourages more waste. However, the levels of emissions from the incinerating process has been greatly reduced by developments in technology and legislation.|$|E

5|$|Long-range atomic {{exchange}} {{is a process}} involving an adatom inserting into the surface as in the normal atomic exchange mechanism, but instead of a nearest-neighbor atom it is an atom some distance further from the initial adatom that emerges. Shown in figure 9, <b>this</b> <b>process</b> <b>has</b> only been observed in molecular dynamics simulations {{and has yet to}} be confirmed experimentally. In spite of this long range atomic exchange, as well as a variety of other exotic diffusion mechanisms, are anticipated to contribute substantially at temperatures currently too high for direct observation.|$|E
5|$|On the {{completion}} of this task, BootX takes over the startup process configuring the keyboard and display, claiming and reserving memory for various purposes and {{checking to see if}} various key combinations are being pressed. After <b>this</b> <b>process</b> <b>has</b> been completed BootX displays the grey Apple logo, spins the spinning wait cursor, and proceeds to load the kernel and some kernel extensions and start the kernel.|$|E
5|$|The {{agriculture}} of {{the parish}} is chiefly confined to grazing, and would be more materially benefited by draining; but the tax upon brick, a most essential article in <b>this</b> <b>process,</b> <b>has</b> been a very great hindrance to it. The use of lime—imported from Wales, and brought by the inland navigations to the neighbourhood of our collieries—has become very general in {{the improvement of the}} meadow and pasture lands.|$|E

5|$|The {{result of}} <b>this</b> <b>process</b> <b>has</b> been {{described}} as being, in effect, an assertion of paramountcy by the Government of India over the states in a more pervasive form. While this contradicted the British statement that paramountcy would lapse on the transfer of power, the Congress position had always been that independent India would inherit the position of being the paramount power.|$|E
5|$|This {{island is}} {{unlikely}} to disappear entirely in the near future. The eroded area consisted mostly of loose tephra, easily washed away. Most of the remaining area is capped by hard lava flows, which are much more resistant to erosion. In addition, complex chemical reactions within the loose tephra within the island have gradually formed highly erosion resistant tuff material, in {{a process known as}} palagonitization. On Surtsey <b>this</b> <b>process</b> <b>has</b> happened quite rapidly, due to high temperatures not far below the surface.|$|E
5|$|PSA-NCAM {{appears as}} another candidate. Mice lacking NCAM show a {{dramatically}} size-reduced OB and {{an accumulation of}} migrating precursors along the RMS. It is possible that lack of NCAM results in agitation of neuron–glia interactions, and modifications in these interactions might in turn {{be responsible for the}} inhibition of migration in the RMS. It has been demonstrated that a cross talk exists between neurons and glial cells and data in favor of an active role of PSA–NCAM in <b>this</b> <b>process</b> <b>has</b> been presented. The lack of PSA–NCAM on the surface of migrating precursors might alter the proliferative properties of this glial cell population, a scenario that appears reminiscent of astrogliosis occurring in neurodegenerative diseases even before any signs of neuronal damage.|$|E

5|$|The {{result of}} <b>this</b> <b>process</b> <b>has</b> {{been a steady}} {{increase}} in the energy output of the Sun. When the Sun first became a main sequence star, it radiated only 70% of the current luminosity. The luminosity has increased in a nearly linear fashion to the present, rising by 1% every 110 million years. Likewise, in three billion years the Sun {{is expected to be}} 33% more luminous. The hydrogen fuel at the core will finally be exhausted in five billion years, when the Sun will be 67% more luminous than at present. Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core, until the luminosity reaches 121% above the present value. This marks the end of the Sun's main sequence lifetime, and thereafter it will pass through the subgiant stage and evolve into a red giant.|$|E
25|$|A process {{based on}} a {{solvation}} extraction process using the triether extractant named above. <b>This</b> <b>process</b> <b>has</b> the disadvantage of requiring {{the use of a}} salting-out reagent (aluminium nitrate) to increase the nitrate concentration in the aqueous phase to obtain a reasonable distribution ratio.

25|$|This is a {{liquid-liquid}} extraction process which uses {{methyl isobutyl ketone}} as the extractant. The extraction is by a solvation mechanism. <b>This</b> <b>process</b> <b>has</b> the disadvantage of requiring {{the use of a}} salting-out reagent (aluminium nitrate) to increase the nitrate concentration in the aqueous phase to obtain a reasonable distribution ratio (D value). Also, hexone is degraded by concentrated nitric acid. <b>This</b> <b>process</b> <b>has</b> been replaced by the PUREX process.|$|E

25|$|Splitting of the {{hydrogen}} molecule is relatively easy by using a platinum catalyst. Unfortunately however, splitting the oxygen molecule is more difficult, and this causes significant electric losses. An appropriate catalyst material for <b>this</b> <b>process</b> <b>has</b> not been discovered, and platinum is the best option.|$|E
25|$|Ocean basins {{that are}} being reduced by {{subduction}} are called 'remnant oceans' as they will slowly be shrunken out of existence and crushed in the subsequent orogenic collision. <b>This</b> <b>process</b> <b>has</b> happened {{over and over in}} the geologic history of the Earth.|$|E
