5|$|Brook Farm {{was named}} for the brook that ran near the {{roadside}} and that eventually went to the Charles River. It was surrounded by low hills and its meadows and sunny slopes were diversified by orchard, quiet groves and denser pine woods. The land, however, turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> farm.|$|E
5|$|Hood was {{initially}} fitted with flying-off platforms mounted {{on top of}} 'B' and 'X' turrets, from which Fairey Flycatchers could launch. During her 1929–31 refit, the platform was removed from 'X' turret and a trainable, folding catapult was installed on her quarterdeck, along with a crane to recover a seaplane. She embarked a Fairey IIIF from No. 444 Flight of the Royal Air Force. During the 1932 West Indies cruise, the catapult proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> operate in anything but a calm sea, as it was frequently awash in bad weather. The catapult and crane were removed in 1932, along with the flying-off platform on 'B' turret.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, a {{group of}} {{materials}} scientists reported that they have successfully generated stable impermeable plasma with no magnetic confinement using only an ultrahigh-pressure blanket of cold gas. While spectroscopic data {{on the characteristics of}} plasma were claimed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> obtain due to the high pressure, the passive effect of plasma on synthesis of different nanostructures clearly suggested the effective confinement. They also showed that upon maintaining the impermeability for a few tens of seconds, screening of ions at the plasma-gas interface could give rise to a strong secondary mode of heating (known as viscous heating) leading to different kinetics of reactions and formation of complex nanomaterials.|$|E

5|$|One {{plot device}} {{used in the}} pilot, Henry's pocket watch, proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> use in {{subsequent}} episodes. In the beginning, the writers would have Henry's pocket watch fall {{out of his pocket}} so that it would not disappear {{with the rest of his}} body. It became more difficult for writers to develop believable scenarios in which Henry would lose his watch, so they did not write it into the plot as frequently in later episodes.|$|E
5|$|In making {{preparations}} for filming, the producers {{found that the}} cost of production in the New York City area would be prohibitive and it was also going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> find locations that resembled early 1950s New York. Part of the financing plan was hinging on a co-production deal with Canada, with filming taking place in Montreal, but Haynes joining the production led to a complete re-think. Karlsen recalled making a film 27 years earlier in Cincinnati, Ohio, that was set in 1950s New York. After researching the city, she found that it had not changed much in decades and the state of Ohio also had one of the best film tax incentives in the United States. The city of Cincinnati was very accommodating to the production, which employed many local citizens as crew.|$|E
5|$|King Khaba is {{considered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> assess {{as a figure}} of ancient Egypt. His name is archaeologically well-attested by stone bowls and mud seal impressions. Khaba's reign is securely dated to the Third Dynasty. Because of the contradictions within Ramesside king lists {{and the lack of}} contemporary, festive inscriptions, his exact chronological position within the dynasty remains disputed. These problems originate in part from contradictory king lists, which were all compiled long after Khaba's death, especially during the Ramesside era. It is also a matter of debate as to where Khaba might have been buried. Many Egyptologists and archaeologists propose that an unfinished step pyramid at Zawyet el'Aryan, known as the Layer Pyramid, belongs to him. Others believe instead that his tomb is a large mastaba close to the Layer Pyramid, where numerous stone vessels bearing Khaba's serekh have been found.|$|E
5000|$|In 1859 the {{confidence}} of the directors was such that they declared that [...] "Since the line was projected, large coalfields have been got into working order, and consequently the expectations formed with regard <b>to</b> traffic has <b>been</b> so far realised." [...] The coalfields referred <b>to</b> <b>are</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> identify, and {{at the time of this}} assertion the Company's bank balance stood at £3.|$|R
50|$|Bramwell is a surname {{derived from}} an {{unidentified}} hamlet in England, {{the name of}} which comes from the Old English for 'broom' or 'bramble well'. The location of the place it referred <b>to</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> trace, as the surname is distributed fairly evenly throughout England. In modern times, 'Bramwell' has also {{been used as a}} masculine given name, with the short form 'Bram'.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} the right <b>to</b> {{sexuality}} <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> define, as it comprises various rights from {{within the framework of}} international human rights law.|$|R
5|$|In 1975, {{while serving}} at the FCO, Penfold volunteered {{to learn a}} {{difficult}} language {{in the hope of}} advancing his career. After passing an aptitude test, he was assigned a professional language tutor and began learning Amharic—the official language of Ethiopia—and after six weeks of tuition, was sent to Gondar to continue learning the language by living in Ethiopia. Shortly after, he was posted to Addis Ababa as second secretary, because the British ambassador to Ethiopia, Sir Willie Morris, was keen to have an Amharic-speaking second secretary. Penfold was responsible for monitoring and reporting on internal Ethiopian affairs and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), as the latter was based in Addis. As part of the role, Penfold was required to attend and report on meetings of the OAU, which took place all over Africa. On the instruction of Foreign Secretary David Owen, Penfold met with the leaders of the independence movement in Southern Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe) at an OAU conference in Gabon in 1977. There he met separately with Bishop Muzorewa, Joshua Nkomo, and Robert Mugabe. Penfold believed Mugabe <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> work with, but later stated that it should have been obvious that Mugabe would come to power in Zimbabwe and that the British government could have made a greater effort to work with him.|$|E

5000|$|Laws, barriers, {{taxes and}} ways <b>to</b> measure <b>are</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> apply solely on a {{national}} basis. Knowledge and information [...] "leak" [...] <b>to</b> where demand <b>is</b> highest and the barriers are lowest.|$|R
25|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} {{that it should be}} possible to do the construction so that the simple group itself is finitely presented. If so one would expect it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> prove as the mapping from presentations to simple groups would have to be non-recursive.|$|E
25|$|Although non-miscible, both LNAPLs and DNAPLs {{still have}} the {{potential}} to slowly dissolve into the aqueous (miscible) phase to create a plume and thus become a long-term source of contamination. DNAPLs (chlorinated solvents, heavy PAHs, creosote, PCBs) tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> manage as they can reside very deep in the groundwater system.|$|E
25|$|Another {{advanced}} {{style of}} passing is the behind-the-back pass, which, as the description implies, involves {{throwing the ball}} behind the passer's back to a teammate. Although some players can perform such a pass effectively, many coaches discourage no-look or behind-the-back passes, believing them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> control {{and more likely to}} result in turnovers or violations.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to cutaneous LP, which is self limited, lichen planus lesions {{in the mouth}} may persist for many years, and tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> treat, with relapses being common. Atrophic/erosive lichen planus {{is associated with a}} small risk of cancerous transformation, and so people with OLP tend to be monitored closely over time to detect any potential change early. Sometimes OLP can become secondarily infected with Candida organisms.|$|E
25|$|Third, several {{effects in}} social {{psychology}} {{have been found}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> replicate even before the current replication crisis. For example, the scientific journal Judgment and Decision Making has published several studies {{over the years that}} fail to provide support for the unconscious thought theory. Replications appear particularly difficult when research trials are pre-registered and conducted by research groups not highly invested in the theory under questioning.|$|E
25|$|The Commonwealth {{military}} force was practically limited to 18,000 soldiers, but was secured by permanent taxing arrangements. The state budget, while enlarged, {{was set at}} {{only a fraction of}} that of Russia or Prussia. Hetman level chief military commanders had their privileges reduced. Limitations were also imposed on legal competence of regional sejmik assemblies, which turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> implement because of continuous inadequacy of central sejm.|$|E

25|$|The {{class was}} {{considered}} reasonably seaworthy, {{although it was}} also found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> accurately fire torpedoes from the 1. class vessels in anything but calm seas. The German-built vessels, {{as well as the}} first three Norwegian-built ships, were criticized for having insufficient manoeuvrability, a design issue that was addressed in the final four vessels built. The class was also considered to have very poor ventilation, especially in the engine compartment.|$|E
25|$|The 41 {{coal mines}} in Silesia mostly {{form part of}} the Gornoslaskie Zaglebie Weglowe {{coalfield}} which lies in the Silesian Upland. The field has an area of about 4,500km2. Deposits in Lower Silesia have proven <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> exploit and the area's unprofitable mines were closed in 2000. In 2008, an estimated 35 billion tonnes of lignite reserves were found near Legnica, making them {{some of the largest}} in the world.|$|E
25|$|Tracheostomy — When {{patients}} require {{mechanical ventilation}} for several weeks, a tracheostomy {{may provide the}} most suitable access to the trachea. A tracheostomy is a surgically created passage into the trachea. Tracheostomy tubes are well-tolerated and often do not necessitate any use of sedative drugs. Tracheostomy tubes may be inserted early during treatment in patients with pre-existing severe respiratory disease, or in any patient expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> wean from mechanical ventilation, i.e., patients with little muscular reserve.|$|E
