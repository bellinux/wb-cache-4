25|$|The British {{historian}} C. R. Boxer {{noted the}} great effect that Pessoa's actions had {{on how the}} Japanese see Portuguese people. According <b>to</b> <b>Boxer,</b> the event apparently gave the Japanese an exaggerated impression of the fighting qualities of the Portuguese, as well as appealing to the Japanese samurai code due to Pessoa's rather un-Christian act of suicide. As such, stories of the event were told and retold again over the next hundred years, often in an exaggerated and wildly inaccurate manner, and found themselves embedded as part of local folklore.|$|E
25|$|Badger (voiced by Andy Cunningham, {{operated}} by Andy Cunningham + others) - Badger {{is named after}} what he is - a badger. He is anthropomorphic - {{he has the ability}} to talk and wears smaller versions of human clothes (including his trademark red beret and red and white patterned neckerchief) and is obsessed with mashed potato, which he likes to play with as well as eat. Because he has a low, booming voice, he has a laugh that's similar <b>to</b> <b>boxer</b> Frank Bruno. He gets Simon into trouble much of the time by playing around with mashed potato because some of the characters do not know about Badger, so instead Simon gets the blame for Badger's mishaps. It is Badger's child-like inability to continually behave that gets him into trouble with Simon, when Simon has to take the blame for many of Badger's antics to try and keep Badger secret. However Badger is still a very good friend to Simon and tries to help him out every way he can. All this said, however, Badger still exhibits the natural instincts of a badger beyond simply his physical limitations by being a badger. For example he still pinches and eats various items that he isn't supposed to in situations when it isn't exactly helpful. On two occasions he has eaten smashed up cake at completely inappropriate times and on another he ate a biro pen when Bodger got one out to fill out a job application form. He can also run very fast (badgers can run up to 19mph) and can frequently be heard scuttling away from any given situation or location.|$|E

2500|$|Years pass, and the {{windmill}} is rebuilt {{along with}} construction of another windmill, {{which makes the}} farm {{a good amount of}} income. However, the ideals which Snowball discussed, including stalls with electric lighting, heating and running water are forgotten, with Napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives. In addition <b>to</b> <b>Boxer,</b> many of the animals who participated in the Revolution are dead, as is Farmer Jones, who died in another part of England. The pigs start to resemble humans, as they walk upright, carry whips, and wear clothes. The Seven Commandments are abridged to a single phrase: [...] "All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others". Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers, with whom he celebrates a new alliance. He abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name [...] "The Manor Farm". As the animals look from pigs to humans, they realise they can no longer distinguish between the two.|$|E
