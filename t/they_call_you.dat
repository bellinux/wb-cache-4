2500|$|In another {{appearance}} on The Arsenio Hall Show during the mid-1990s, Hammer debuted the video for [...] "Pumps and a Bump". Talk show host Arsenio Hall said to M.C. Hammer, [...] "Women {{in the audience}} want to know, what's in your speedos in the 'Pumps and a Bump' video?" [...] A clip from the video was then shown, to much approval from the audience. Hammer didn't give a direct answer, but instead laughed. Arsenio then said, [...] "I guess that's why <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>you</b> 'Hammer.' It ain't got nothin' to do with Hank Aaron." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Stephen King's request, Ellison {{provided}} {{a description of}} himself and his writing in Danse Macabre. [...] "My work is foursquare for chaos. I spend my life personally, and my work professionally, keeping the soup boiling. [...] is what <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>you</b> when {{you are no longer}} dangerous; I much prefer troublemaker, malcontent, desperado. I see myself as a combination of Zorro and Jiminy Cricket. My stories go out from here and raise hell. From time to time some denigrater or critic with umbrage will say of my work, 'He only wrote that to shock.' I smile and nod. Precisely." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Nation of Islam has {{repeatedly}} denied charges of anti-Semitism. Farrakhan has stated, [...] "The ADL... {{uses the term}} 'anti-Semitism' to stifle all criticism of Zionism and the Zionist policies of the State of Israel and also to stifle all legitimate criticism of the errant behavior of some Jewish people toward the non-Jewish population of the earth." [...] However, NOI officials and outlets including Farrakhan have also been accused of repeatedly using anti-semitic and homophobic rhetoric, including saying, [...] "It's the wicked Jews, the false Jews, that are promoting lesbianism, homosexuality. It's the wicked Jews, false Jews, that make it a crime for you to preach the word of God, then <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>you</b> homophobic!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Cruz {{rejects the}} {{scientific}} consensus on climate change. He {{has said that}} [...] "the scientific evidence doesn't support global warming". He has also stated: [...] "They call anyone who questions the science who even points to the satellite data â€“ <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>you</b> a, quote, 'denier'. Denier is not the language of science. Denier {{is the language of}} religion. It is heretic. You are a blasphemer. It's treated as a theology. But it's about power and money. At the end of the day, it's not complicated. This is liberal politicians who want government power." [...] In March 2015, he said that some people are [...] "global warming alarmists" [...] and, citing satellite temperature measurements, said that there had been no significant warming in 18 years.|$|E
6000|$|They {{passed out}} of the smaller drawing-room, into which they had {{returned}} from the gallery, and paused in the hall, {{at the foot of}} the staircase. Here Ralph presented his companion with her bedroom candle, which he had taken from a niche. [...] "Never mind what <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>you.</b> When you do suffer <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>you</b> an idiot. The great point's to be as happy as possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And besides, {{the fall}} {{would have killed}} it," [...] said Kate conclusively. [...] "It's lovely. I suppose <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>you</b> a very good shot?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Misbelieving Hakim," [...] {{said the}} Grand Master, [...] "or {{whatsoever}} <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>thee</b> for an unbaptized slave of darkness, dost thou well know that thou shalt be torn asunder by wild horses should King Richard die under thy charge?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{did wrong}} you. In thought--in word. I ordered you {{from my home}} {{as if you were}} indeed what <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>you.</b> But I was deceived. I see my error. If you entered my home again I would think it an honor. I--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That is nonsense," [...] {{said the}} Woggle-Bug, digging {{with all his}} might; [...] "for <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>you</b> the foreman, and yet I only see one of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you ask me}} why, Sire?" [...] said I. [...] "Because <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>you</b> Louis the Just, {{and because}} no king was ever more deserving of the title." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Hark!" [...] {{she said}} triumphantly, [...] "dost hear? The people <b>call</b> to <b>thee!</b> <b>They</b> {{are ready to}} deify <b>thee.</b> <b>They</b> <b>call</b> for <b>thee,</b> dost hear them, O praefect?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not {{for nothing}} that <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>you</b> the Magnificent," [...] he answered, with a fresh bow, insensible to the sting in the tail of my honeyed words.|$|E
6000|$|... "So that's why <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>you</b> Panhandle Smith?" [...] queried the girl, meditatively. [...] "I mean {{with the}} tone old man Hardman used. They call me Angel. But that doesn't mean what it sounds, does it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fresh water," [...] resumed Cap pithily; [...] "you are not {{to expect}} {{too much of the}} young man, Mabel. I think <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>you</b> {{sometimes}} by a name which would insinuate all this: Eau-de-vie, is it not?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There," [...] said She, [...] "he has gone, the white-bearded old fool! Ah, {{how little}} {{knowledge}} does a man acquire in his life.

Is it not so? But how <b>call</b> <b>they</b> <b>thee?</b> 'Baboon,' he says," [...] and she laughed; [...] "but that is the fashion of these savages who lack imagination, and fly to the beasts they resemble for a name. How do <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>thee</b> in thine own country, stranger?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These plaguy {{southern}} winds {{at their}} tricks," [...] muttered at first Earl Gilbert of Gloucester, for he it was who had spoken, though Richard {{had not known}} him to be so near; then sitting up, {{he came to a}} fuller view: [...] "Hm--it looks ill! Thou canst keep thy feet, Fowen, or what do <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>thee?</b> Down with thee to the cabin, and let the Prince know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bravo, comrade!" [...] {{the marshal}} said; [...] "spoken {{in the true}} spirit of a soldier. Were there a dozen men like you in every {{regiment}} I should have no fear for the future. Did <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>you</b> Englishman?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I observe <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>you</b> 'Stanislaus Joe.' Of {{course that}} is not your real name?"

6000|$|... "Everyone {{will be glad}} to {{know that}} you are safely back; and you too, Mrs. Martin. Everyone has missed Miss Patsey, as <b>they</b> still <b>call</b> <b>you</b> when <b>they</b> speak of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have left}} that phase of my {{existence}} behind me," [...] Jules laughed; [...] "henceforth I {{am a man}} of war, a rebel, a brigand, as <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>you,</b> prepared for any desperate adventure, ready to rush up to a cannon's mouth." ...|$|E
6000|$|If {{you meet}} King George's men, dressed in blue and red, You {{be careful what}} you say, and mindful what is said. If <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>you</b> 'pretty maid,' and chuck you 'neath the chin, Don't you tell where no one is, nor yet where no one's been! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fight!" [...] cried Thorne, hotly. [...] "What's ailing him? Didn't <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>you</b> Biff Gale in college? Dick, {{you were}} one of the best men Stagg ever developed.
