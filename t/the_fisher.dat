5|$|In 2008, {{advances}} in DNA analysis allowed {{a more detailed}} study of the fisher's evolutionary history. It was determined that <b>the</b> <b>fisher</b> and the Martes genera were descended from a common ancestor but <b>the</b> <b>fisher</b> was distinct enough {{to put it in}} its own genera. It was decided to create the Pekania genera and reclassify <b>the</b> <b>fisher</b> as Pekania pennanti.|$|E
5|$|In Winter of <b>the</b> <b>Fisher,</b> Cameron Langford relates {{a fictional}} {{encounter}} between a fisher and an aging recluse {{living in the}} forest. The recluse frees <b>the</b> <b>fisher</b> from a trap and nurses it back to health. <b>The</b> <b>fisher</b> tolerates the attention, but being a wild animal, returns to the forest when well enough. Langford uses the ecology and known habits of <b>the</b> <b>fisher</b> to weave a tale of survival and tolerance in the northern woods of Canada.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fisher</b> (Pekania pennanti) {{is a small}} {{carnivorous}} mammal {{native to}} North America. It {{is a member of}} the mustelid family (commonly referred to as the weasel family) and is in the monospecific genus Pekania. <b>The</b> <b>fisher</b> is closely related to but larger than the American marten (Martes americana). <b>The</b> <b>fisher</b> is a forest-dwelling creature whose range covers much of the boreal forest in Canada to the northern United States. Names derived from aboriginal languages include pekan, pequam, wejack, and woolang. It is also called a fisher cat, although it is not a feline.|$|E
5|$|I-375 and the Chrysler Freeway {{begin at}} Jefferson Avenue and St. Antoine Street in {{downtown}} Detroit near the Renaissance Center. They run east before turning north. Just {{about a mile}} (1.6km) after the southern terminus, I-375 meets <b>the</b> <b>Fisher</b> Freeway which carries I-75 north of downtown. At this interchange, I-75 takes ramps to leave <b>the</b> <b>Fisher</b> Freeway and use the Chrysler Freeway, replacing I-375. I-375 is a four-lane freeway south of the I-75 interchange, where it widens to six lanes. The entire length of I-375 is included on the National Highway System, a network of roadways {{that are important to}} the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|I-75 {{has five}} named {{segments}} in Michigan. The southernmost section {{from the state}} line north to the Detroit area is the Detroit–Toledo Expressway. The segment through southern and central Detroit is known as <b>the</b> <b>Fisher</b> Freeway. It was dedicated on September 17, 1970, to <b>the</b> <b>Fisher</b> Brothers, who founded Fisher Body, later a part of General Motors. After the curve in downtown Detroit, I-75 follows the Walter P. Chrysler Freeway northward. That segment is named for Walter P. Chrysler, founder of Chrysler. The name was chosen by the Detroit Common Council on November 6, 1957, and codified in state law in 1990; the state definition for the name places {{the northern end of}} the designation at the Oakland–Genesee county line.|$|E

5|$|The Latin {{specific}} name pennanti {{is named for}} Thomas Pennant, who described <b>the</b> <b>fisher</b> in 1771. Buffon had first described the creature in 1765, calling it a pekan. Pennant examined the same specimen but called it a fisher, unaware of Buffon's earlier description. Other 18th-century scientists gave it similar names, such as Schreber, who named it Mustela canadensis, and Boddaert, who named it Mustela melanorhyncha. <b>The</b> <b>fisher</b> was eventually placed in the genus Martes by Smith in 1843.|$|E
5|$|Fisher {{became an}} {{apprentice}} draughtsman at Swan Hunter, Wallsend, and attended evening classes at Rutherford College before being accepted into London University in 1920.

40|$|Entrepreneurship inclinations {{among the}} board members of <b>the</b> <b>Fisher's</b> Associations {{have been found to}} be a crucial issue for further investigation. A {{structured}} questionnaire was developed by reviewing the literatures and data gathered through in-depth interviews with board members of <b>the</b> <b>Fisher's</b> Associations. Correlation analysis has been employed to examine the hypotheses. The study demonstrates that monthly income and educational level have an influence on entrepreneurial inclinations among {{the board members}} of <b>the</b> <b>Fisher's</b> Association. <b>The</b> study revealed that entrepreneurial inclinations among the board members of <b>the</b> <b>Fisher's</b> Associations were low. This was due to the nature of fishers' job (work status), which required them to go fishing in the sea. The study recommends that measures should be taken for less dependency on general manager as well as enhancing capacity building activities for the members of the association...|$|R

5|$|On Baker's retirement, Gould was {{unanimously}} elected President on 20 February 1907. He endeavoured to {{keep the}} Senate representative of the states' interests and free from party politics, and his rulings focused on unparliamentary language and relevance.

5|$|Three {{subspecies}} {{were identified}} by Goldman in 1935, M.p. columbiana, M.p. pacifica, and M.p. pennanti. Later research has debated whether these subspecies could be positively identified. In 1959, E.M. Hagmeier concluded that the subspecies are not separable based on either fur or skull characteristics. Although some debate still exists, in general it is recognized that <b>the</b> <b>fisher</b> is a monotypic species with no extant subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Below Libby Dam the river, {{now known}} as the Kootenai, surges around {{the south side of the}} Purcell Mountains in what is known as the Big Bend, where it {{receives}} <b>the</b> <b>Fisher</b> River from the left and veers to the west, passing the city of Libby. The Kootenai then drops over Kootenai Falls in a gorge, and veers northwest at the town of Troy. The Yaak River and Moyie River join from the north from headwaters in British Columbia, the latter near the village of Moyie Springs, before and after the Kootenai crosses the Montana-Idaho state line. In Idaho the Kootenai's current slows significantly as it enters the Kootenai Valley, passing the city of Bonners Ferry, where it turns north.|$|E

5|$|Despite Gray {{constantly}} seeking {{collectors and}} {{people to help}} him with the Harvard herbarium, in the first fifteen years he was at Harvard, no graduate entered botany as a career. This changed in 1858 with the arrival of Daniel Cady Eaton, who had graduated from Yale University in 1857 and came to Harvard to study with Gray. Eaton later returned to Yale to be a botany professor and oversee its herbarium, just as Gray did at Harvard. Daniel Eaton was the grandson of Amos Eaton, whose textbooks Gray had studied during his college days. Eaton influenced the teaching style of Gray, and both required practical work of their students. Gray retained <b>the</b> <b>Fisher</b> post until 1873 while living in the Asa Gray House.|$|E
5|$|Fisher wanted {{additional}} Commonwealth {{power in}} certain areas, {{such as the}} nationalisation of monopolies. A constitutional referendum was initiated in 1911 which aimed to increase the federal government's legislative powers over trade and commerce and over monopolies. Both questions were defeated, with around 61 per cent voting 'No'. <b>The</b> <b>Fisher</b> government made another attempt, holding a referendum in 1913 which asked for greater federal powers over trade and commerce, corporations, industrial matters, trusts, monopolies, and railway disputes. All six questions were defeated, with around 51 per cent voting 'No'. At the 1913 election, the Commonwealth Liberal Party, led by Joseph Cook, defeated the Labor Party by a single seat.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have five}} toes on each foot, with unsheathed, {{retractable}} claws. Their feet are disproportionately large for their legs, {{making it easier}} for them to move on top of snow packs. In addition to the toes, there are four central pads on each foot. On the hind paws there are coarse hairs that grow between the pads and the toes, giving them added traction when walking on a variety of surfaces. Fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180 degrees, allowing them to maneuver well in trees and climb down head-first. <b>The</b> <b>fisher</b> is one of relatively few mammalian species with the ability to descend trees head-first.|$|E

5|$|The Charodis, {{the second-largest}} group, were {{converts}} from the Kshatriya (warrior class) and Vaishya (merchant class) castes. They were generally engaged in trade and commercial vocations. The artisan converts formed the third-biggest group and {{were known as}} Sudirs (the Konkani word for Shudras, which were the labour class). They were workers and agricultural labourers engaged in service professions. The converts from <b>the</b> <b>fisher</b> caste residing around Ullal, Kuloor, and other places around the seacoast were called Gaudis, and formed the fourth group. They cultivated the lands of the Bamonns and the high-caste Hindus. Other minor castes included the Padvals, whom historian Severine Silva assumes to be local Jain converts.|$|E
