It was found by experiment that when they were hidden in the shadows in <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> were invisible from the air and so 2000 tons of petrol were thus stored. Over 100,000 four-gallon petrol tins were stacked in the 100 stone-faced slit trenches.|$|E
5|$|San Martín {{proposed}} that the country declare independence immediately, before the crossing. <b>That</b> <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> would be acting as a sovereign nation, {{and not as a}} mere rebellion. He had great influence over the Congress of Tucumán, a Congress with deputies from the provinces, which was established in March 1816. He opposed the appointment of José Moldes, a soldier from Salta who was against the policies of Buenos Aires, as he feared Moldes would break national unity. He rejected proposals to be appointed Supreme Director himself. He supported his friend and lodge member Juan Martín de Pueyrredón for the office. Pueyrredón resumed the military aid to Cuyo. The Congress of Tucumán declared independence on 9 July 1816. Congress discussed the type of government of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (modern Argentina). General Manuel Belgrano, who had made a diplomatic mission to Europe, informed them that independence would be more easily acknowledged by the European powers if the country established a monarchy. For this purpose, Belgrano proposed a plan to crown a noble of the Inca Empire as king (the Sapa Inca dynasty had been dethroned in the 16th century). San Martín supported this proposal, as well as Güemes and most deputies, except for those from Buenos Aires, who undermined the project and prevented its approval.|$|E
25|$|In France in the 18th century, {{returns for}} investors in {{plantations}} averaged around 6%; {{as compared to}} 5% for most domestic alternatives, this represented a 20% profit advantage. Risks—maritime and commercial—were important for individual voyages. Investors mitigated it by buying small shares of many ships at the same time. In <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> were able to diversify {{a large part of}} the risk away. Between voyages, ship shares could be freely sold and bought.|$|E

25|$|Syllable {{deletion}} – stressed syllables are emphasis {{that may}} be given to certain syllables in a word.

So children may say helikat instead of helicopter or fowe instead of telephone. <b>That</b> <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> don't pronounce the more emphasized sound in the word.|$|E
25|$|Remains {{show that}} humans were already settled the marshy areas of Mačva in 5000 BCE.

Other legend connected to the area is that of winged dragons. Ancient Celtic maps show area of Zasavica as one of 8 dragon-inhabited places in the Balkans.|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{composed}} {{this song}} {{in the form of}} a 12-bar blues. In the sleeve notes of Freewheelin, Dylan explained to Nat Hentoff: [...] "What made the real blues singers so great is that they were able to state all the problems they had; but at the same time, they were standing outside of them and could look at them. And in <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> had them beat." [...] Into this song, Dylan injected one explicit mention of an absence that was troubling him: the sojourn of Suze Rotolo in Perugia: [...] "My baby took my heart from me/ She packed it all up in a suitcase/ Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy." ...|$|E

Referring back to the league fixture in October 2004, he told reporters: [...] "We committed three fouls on Reyes, for instance, but that hardly constitutes The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, does it? There were six by them on Cristiano Ronaldo." [...] He questioned the character of Arsenal's players after they lost their unbeaten record, and likened their protest to propaganda, {{as a way to}} disguise their crisis – [...] "...it was convenient for them to say they were kicked off the park." [...] United had struggled to score goals in the lead up to the final, and Ferguson stressed the importance of his team taking their chances. [...] "Big games are usually decided <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> <b>They</b> are so close so that whoever gets in front has an advantage," [...] he said.|$|E

Although he seems to like helping Rapunzel adjust to her new royal life, he eventually starts to feel he doesn't belong with her and runs away, to Rapunzel's isolated tower in the deepest parts of the forest. In Episode 11, it is revealed that, as a baby, his mother had sent him to safety on a lily-pad to escape a ravenous snake that was pursing them. As his mother was eaten by the snake, he had floated down a waterfall, where he heard [...] young Rapunzel singing. He climbed her tower but was still being followed by the snake which infected him with its lethal venom. It was then that the young Rapunzel used the light-based, healing magic of her blond hair to return him to life. She welcomed the infant chameleon as her best friend, <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> {{would never have to}} be alone again.|$|E

[...] During this time, he generally released cover versions and remakes, including a cover-collaboration with Erykah Badu of the Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell duet song [...] "Your Precious Love" [...] for the soundtrack to High School High (1996). D'Angelo also covered Prince's [...] "She's Always in My Hair" [...] for the Scream 2 soundtrack (1997), as well as the Ohio Players' [...] "Heaven Must Be Like This" [...] for the Down in the Delta soundtrack (1998).

500|$|Tripp {{wrote in}} the May 1982 issue of the Journal of Sex Research that Sexual Preference would likely be seen as [...] "a shock and a disappointment", since its authors {{abandoned}} many of Alfred Kinsey's methods and conclusions {{and in some cases}} even misrepresented them. Tripp criticized Bell et al. for ignoring Kinsey's warning to make careful observations and [...] "avoid theory", and for attempting to test the validity of psychoanalytic theories, which he considered already discredited by professionals. While Tripp nevertheless believed that Bell et al. had rendered a valuable service by showing that psychoanalytic theories are unsupported, he rejected their argument that since psychoanalytic ideas are incorrect the origins of sexual orientation must be genetic and hormonal, noting that in order to reason <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> had to ignore the work of sex researchers such as Frank Beach. Tripp also accused Bell et al. of citing low quality and unreplicated hormone studies, ignoring evidence relating homosexuality to early puberty, and substituting [...] "inductive for deductive methods". In the same issue, Bell et al. replied to Tripp′s review, accusing him of making false statements about their data analysis, misrepresenting their conclusions, and making [...] "ridiculous criticisms" [...] of the scientific method they had employed. Tripp responded in the November 1982 issue of the Journal of Sex Research, accusing Bell et al. of making personal attacks, and attempting to refute them on specific points.|$|E

2500|$|Ishiro Honda {{wanted the}} theme of the movie to be a satire of the Television {{industry}} in Japan. In April 1962, TV networks and their various sponsors started producing outrageous programming and publicity stunts to grab audiences attention after two elderly viewers reportedly died at home while watching a violent wrestling match on TV. The various rating wars between the networks and banal programming that followed this event caused widespread debate over how TV would effect Japanese culture with Soichi Oya stating TV was creating [...] "a nation of 100 million idiots". Honda stated [...] "People were making {{a big deal out of}} ratings, but my own view of TV shows was that they did not take the viewer seriously, that they took the audience for granted....so I decided to show that through my movie" [...] and [...] "the reason I showed the monster battle through the prism of a ratings war was to depict the reality of the times". Honda addressed this by having a pharmaceutical company sponsor a TV show and going to extremes for a publicity stunt for ratings by capturing a giant monster stating [...] "All a medicine company would have to do is just produce good medicines you know? But the company doesn't think <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> <b>They</b> think they will get ahead of their competitors if they use a monster to promote their product.". Honda would work with screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa on developing the story stating that [...] "Back then Sekizawa was working on pop songs and TV shows so he really had a clear insight into television".|$|E
2500|$|The salt of {{this type}} was less {{expensive}} and the conquistadors concluded that the grainy salt went up the river, while the better salt came from higher altitudes down the river. The indigenous people who carried the salt, told the conquistadors that {{it was coming from}} a land of richness. This led the Spanish uphill, on the Camino de la Sal ("The Salt Route") to search for its source. At this point, the Sierras del Opón were crossed and the brigantines returned to the coast, leaving the majority of the soldiers with De Quesada because many of his troops had died already during the expedition. The route over the Sierras del Opón is described as rugged and little populated by natives, a journey of various days and 50 leguas long. In the sparse settlements, the conquistadors found great quantities of the high quality salts and after a while they had crossed the difficult mountainous area, reaching a flatter terrain, described as [...] "what would become the New Kingdom of Granada". It is described that the people of this area were different and also spoke a different language from the people along the Magdalena River and of the Sierras del Opón, making it impossible to understand them at first. Over time, it became possible to communicate and the people in the flatter area, called San Gregorio provided the conquistadors with emeralds. Jiménez de Quesada asked the people where they were coming from and the natives pointed him to the Valle de los Alcázares (Bogotá savanna), upon which the troops headed <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> <b>They</b> encountered a [...] "king" [...] they called Bogothá who gave the conquistadors many golden objects to expel the Spanish from his lands and the indigenous people told the Spanish the emeralds were coming from lands belonging to the [...] "king" [...] of Tunja.|$|E
