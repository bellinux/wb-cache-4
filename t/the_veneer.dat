Jan Lipták Title: Review of the {{possibility}} of the use of <b>the</b> stone <b>veneer</b> for constructional materials sheathing The aim of the diploma thesis was to review whether <b>the</b> stone <b>veneer</b> is suitable or comparable material for sheathing constructional materials. <b>The</b> beech <b>veneer</b> was used for the comparison. Firstly, the history of <b>the</b> <b>veneers</b> and <b>the</b> decorative <b>veneers</b> manufacturing are described in the theoretical part. Then it is focused on the stone treatment, its history and the manufacturing of <b>the</b> stone <b>veneer.</b> <b>The</b> next part of the thesis deals with the methods of the stone and beech veneer testing: bending strength tests, glue strength tests, humidity and density assessing and tests of the surface working resistance to a falling small ball. Further, results of measurements are presented in form of tables and graphs. The results proved that <b>the</b> stone <b>veneer</b> is comparable to <b>the</b> beech <b>veneer</b> that reached better results in bending strength. <b>The</b> stone <b>veneer</b> is better in the glue strength. The density tests pointed out the higher density of <b>the</b> stone <b>veneer.</b> <b>The</b> humidity is influenced by the density and <b>the</b> stone <b>veneer</b> samples were of lower humidity. The tests of the surface working resistance to a falling small ball did not recorded notable differences, the degree of the damage was assessed to be of the level 4. The last part of the thesis comprises the discussion, conclusion and literature references...|$|R

25|$|Industrial hip hop fuses {{the themes}} and {{aesthetics}} of industrial with hip hop music. Its origins {{are in the}} work of Mark Stewart and Adrian Sherwood. In 1985, Stewart, former Pop Group singer, released As <b>the</b> <b>Veneer</b> of Democracy Starts to Fade, applying the cut-up style of industrial music with the house band of Sugar Hill Records (Doug Wimbish, Keith Leblanc, and Skip McDonald). Sherwood was a major figure in British dub music, as well as working with industrial groups such as Cabaret Voltaire, Einstürzende Neubauten, Ministry, KMFDM, and Nine Inch Nails. Tackhead, a collaboration between Sherwood and the Sugar Hill band, picked up where Stewart left off. The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, from San Francisco, and Meat Beat Manifesto, from the UK, are also early representatives of the style. The later work of Broadrick's Godflesh, as well as his collaborations with Kevin Martin, Ice, and Techno Animal, are examples of industrial hip hop. Saul Williams, a slam poet, also performs in the style. Other notable contributors include: CX KidtroniK, clipping., B L A C K I E, Death Grips, and Electric Caves.|$|E

The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain.

5000|$|This {{process begins}} with the same {{treatment}} process that the rotary peel method uses.

Engineered hardwood produced this way tends to have fewer problems with [...] "face checking", and also does not have the same plywood appearance in the grain.

40|$|Laminated bending of veneers {{mean that}} dried, thin veneers or thin wood sheets are glued {{together}} {{under influence of}} pressure and eventually increased temperature. At {{the same time the}} product is given its desired shape, most often curved. This thermo hydro mechanical process offers several benefits. For example thick bends of small radiuses of any species of wood may be formed and poor quality wood containing knots, splits and other defects may be utilised. Laminated bends can usually be set more readily and made to conform better to the shape of the form than similar bends of solid wood. Further no softening treatment is generally required before the pieces are bent. However, there are also disadvantages e. g. more technical skill and better equipment are usually required than for solid wood bending. The presence of glue may be somewhat detrimental to the machines used for the final cleaning up of the bent pieces. Further the glue lines which are usually visible on the sides may be an aesthetical unappreciated effect [1],[2]. The quality of <b>the</b> laminated bended <b>veneer</b> products are obtained as an interaction between <b>the</b> process, <b>the</b> <b>veneers</b> and <b>the</b> glue [3]. In industries designing and producing these products it is of interest to obtain better understanding of how processing- and material parameters affect the product quality. With an improved understanding of the material and processing parameters {{it may be possible to}} increase the efficiency of wood utilisation and promote the development of new processes and products that manipulate the viscoelastic nature of wood. In particular the possibilities to obtain narrower radius of curvature and better possibilities of bending in more than one plane would be advantageous. This study has focused on the moisture content (MC) and the grain angle orientation in <b>the</b> <b>veneers.</b> These two specific aspects were assumed to have a great influence on spring-back and distortions of <b>the</b> laminated bended <b>veneer</b> products. Spring-back and distortions were therefore studied in separate tests where MC and the grain angle orientation was varied separately in manufactured laminated bended wood products. After manufacturing the products were exposed to variations in humidity and temperature whereupon the spring-back and distortions were measuredThree tests were performed. For the first and the second test a seat shell was selected as test product, figure 1 a. To the third test another product was selected, figure 1 b. This product was a small bookshelf. The company producing this shelf had experienced large problems considering distortions of this product. Further the product was very simple in shape with only one bend and therefore suitable for measurements. In the first test the influence of MC of <b>the</b> <b>veneers</b> was investigated. In the second and third test the influence of grain angle of <b>the</b> <b>veneers</b> was studied. For <b>the</b> study <b>veneers</b> of birch and beech were selected in the production. For the first and third study only birch <b>veneers</b> were used. <b>The</b> <b>veneers</b> were initially conditioned to equilibrium moisture contents (EMC) according to setups in different test groups. For the first study a test group was also built up from veneers taken directly out of production to study the industrial conditions. The seat shells in this test group contained veneers conditioned to EMC 4 %, except for <b>the</b> surface <b>veneers</b> that had been stored in the production hall. The humidity and temperature conditions in this room corresponded to MC 7 %. The manufacturing of the products were performed in industrial conditions. In the tests the products were built up from a number of <b>veneers</b> and <b>the</b> studied factors were varied between <b>the</b> <b>veneers</b> in a controlled manner. The results from the first test showed that the MC of <b>the</b> <b>veneers</b> influenced <b>the</b> spring-back and the distortions. A large moisture gradient between veneers and especially unsymmetrical placements of these in the construction were especially critical. The results from the second and third tests showed that grain angle deviation has large effect on the distortions of the products. Even a small grain angle deviation as in study two (5 °) resulted in large problems with distortions. The study also showed that when crossing two or more veneers with deviating grain angles there were cases when these faults interacted and multiplied the distortions. In production grain angle deviations can be a result of inaccurate placement of <b>the</b> <b>veneers</b> during pressing, incorrect cutting of <b>the</b> <b>veneers,</b> inherent from <b>the</b> growth of the tree or a combination of these factors. Deviations of the grain angle were, however, shown to have only small effects on spring-back. Upprättat; 2011; 20130911 (ysko...|$|R

500|$|A {{second problem}} later arose showing {{the need for}} the Second Settlement in {{what became known as the}} [...] "Marcus Primus Affair". In late 24 or early 23BC, charges were brought against Marcus Primus, the former proconsul (governor) of Macedonia, for waging a war without prior {{approval}} of the Senate on the Odrysian kingdom of Thrace, whose king was a Roman ally. He was defended by Lucius Lucinius Varro Murena, who told the trial that his client had received specific instructions from Augustus, ordering him to attack the client state. Later, Primus testified that the orders came from the recently deceased Marcellus. Such orders, had they been given, would have been considered a breach of the Senate's prerogative under the Constitutional settlement of 27 BC and its aftermath—i.e., before Augustus was granted imperium proconsulare maius—as Macedonia was a Senatorial province under the Senate's jurisdiction, not an imperial province under the authority of Augustus. Such an action would have ripped away <b>the</b> <b>veneer</b> of Republican restoration as promoted by Augustus, and exposed his fraud of merely being the first citizen, a first among equals. Even worse, the involvement of Marcellus provided some measure of proof that Augustus's policy was to have the youth take his place as Princeps, instituting a form of monarchy– accusations that had already played out.|$|E
