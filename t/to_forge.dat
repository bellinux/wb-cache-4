5|$|For {{many years}} in his {{parliamentary}} career Disraeli hoped <b>to</b> <b>forge</b> a paternalistic Tory-Radical alliance, but he was unsuccessful. Before the Reform Act 1867, the working class did not possess the vote and therefore had little political power. Although Disraeli forged a personal friendship with John Bright, a Lancashire manufacturer and leading Radical, Disraeli was unable to persuade Bright to sacrifice his distinct position for parliamentary advancement. When Disraeli attempted to secure a Tory-Radical cabinet in 1852, Bright refused.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, the Mint gained {{its first}} female Director, Nellie Tayloe Ross, and despite initial mistrust {{between her and}} O'Reilly, they came <b>to</b> <b>forge</b> a strong bond. Although {{scheduled}} for mandatory retirement in 1935, O'Reilly {{was considered to be}} so indispensable to the bureau's operations that U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt postponed this until 1938. During her later years, O'Reilly remained in Washington D.C.; she no longer involved herself in Mint affairs, instead devoting much of her attention to Catholic charitable work.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Nasser {{returned}} to his role as an instructor at the Royal Military Academy. He sent emissaries <b>to</b> <b>forge</b> an alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood in October 1948, but soon concluded that the religious agenda of the Brotherhood was not compatible with his nationalism. From then on, Nasser prevented the Brotherhood's influence over his cadres' activities without severing ties with the organization. Nasser was sent {{as a member of}} the Egyptian delegation to Rhodes in February 1949 to negotiate a formal armistice with Israel, and reportedly considered the terms to be humiliating, particularly because the Israelis were able to easily occupy the Eilat region while negotiating with the Arabs in March.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the motives}} they {{suggested}} for a forgery are not strong, and are contradictory; {{one is that}} Richard Owen wanted <b>to</b> <b>forge</b> {{evidence in support of}} Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, which is unlikely given Owen's views toward Darwin and his theory. The other is that Owen wanted to set a trap for Darwin, hoping the latter would support the fossils so Owen could discredit him with the forgery; this is unlikely because Owen wrote a detailed paper on the London specimen, so such an action would certainly backfire.|$|E
5|$|Ginetta, then {{seventeen}} years old, was already {{active in the}} resistance movement, delivering food coupons and clothing to Jews who were in hiding. Following her parents' disappearance, she became a courier for resistance forces in Northern Italy, as well as helping to print and distribute antigovernment pamphlets. On one occasion, she dressed as a cleaning lady to steal letterhead from government offices {{so that it could}} be used <b>to</b> <b>forge</b> letters of safe passage to Switzerland. Due to her energy and small size (she never grew to more than five feet tall), she received the nickname Topolino ("Little Mouse").|$|E

5|$|In 77 BC, {{the senate}} sent one of Sulla's former lieutenants, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great"), {{to put down}} an {{uprising}} in Hispania. By 71 BC, Pompey returned to Rome after having completed his mission. Around the same time, another of Sulla's former lieutenants, Marcus Licinius Crassus, had just put down the Spartacus-led gladiator/slave revolt in Italy. Upon their return, Pompey and Crassus found the populares party fiercely attacking Sulla's constitution. They attempted <b>to</b> <b>forge</b> {{an agreement with the}} populares party. If both Pompey and Crassus were elected consul in 70 BC, they would dismantle the more obnoxious components of Sulla's constitution. The two were soon elected, and quickly dismantled most of Sulla's constitution.|$|E
5|$|Krüger hid at {{his home}} until November 1946 when he handed himself over to the British authorities. Forging an enemy's {{currency}} was not a war crime; he faced no charges. He was detained until early 1947 when he was {{handed over to the}} French. They attempted to persuade him <b>to</b> <b>forge</b> passports for them, but he refused; he was released in November 1948. He underwent a denazification process, during which statements were produced from the forger-inmates whose lives he had been responsible for saving. He later worked for the Hahnemühle paper company. In 1965 the East German writer Julius Mader published , an attack on the West German government for harbouring Krüger.|$|E
5|$|Odaenathus {{observed}} all due formalities {{towards the}} emperor, {{but in practice}} ruled as an independent monarch. In 266, the king launched a second invasion of Persia but had to abandon the campaign and head north to Bithynia to repel the attacks of Germanic riders besieging the city of Heraclea Pontica. He was assassinated in 267 during or immediately after the Anatolian campaign, together with Hairan. The identities of the perpetrator or the instigator are unknown and many stories, accusations and speculations exist in ancient sources. He was succeeded by his son Vaballathus under the regency of his widow Zenobia, who used the power established by Odaenathus <b>to</b> <b>forge</b> the Palmyrene Empire in 270.|$|E

5|$|The Forge {{junction}} at Telford Town Centre {{was awarded}} relatively late, {{to the company}} Norwest Holst. The junction precipitated the construction of Telford Shopping Centre, and the central commercial area, as the exchange was upgraded to allow traffic from the motorway to join and exit in both directions. The Forge to Cluddley section, from junction 5 to junction 7, opened to traffic in December 1975. The Hilton Park <b>to</b> <b>Forge</b> section, from the M6 to junction 5, opened in November 1983. The motorway cost 65 million pounds to build, which when adjusted for inflation would come to approximately 150 million 2006 GBP.|$|E

In addition to disseminating teachings, the internet serves <b>to</b> <b>forge</b> and maintain community, and is used as a medium for raising awareness of the persecution in China.

5|$|With {{support from}} California (because {{the state had}} profited from the import of sugar), Kalākaua again {{approached}} Congress.

Congress feared that a treaty between Hawaii and Australia or New Zealand would result in annexation by one of those countries instead of the United States. Although Kalākaua was loath to give any foreign country land in Hawaii, he signed the treaty in September 1887.|$|E
5|$|After {{years in}} opposition, in 1849, Paraná was {{appointed}} by the national government as president of Pernambuco Province to investigate a Liberal rebellion {{that had taken place}} a year earlier, and seek a fair trial for the rebels.

With the nation internally pacified, he was sent to Uruguay in 1851 <b>to</b> <b>forge</b> an alliance with that country, and with the rebel Argentine provinces of Corrientes and Entre Ríos, against the Argentine Confederation.
