40|$|It is "conventional wisdom" {{that the}} {{uncertainty}} of local temperature measurements on equilibrium systems diverges exponentially fast as their temperature T drops to zero. In contrast, some exactly solvable models showcase a more benign power-law-like scaling, when only a small non-equilibrium fragment of the equilibrium system is measured. Does this mean that a part may contain {{more information about the}} global temperature than the whole? Certainly not. Here, we resolve this apparent paradox. First, we prove that local quantum thermometry at low T is exponentially inefficient in non-critical, gapped, and infinite spin and harmonic lattices. In contrast, we show through an open-system analysis, that the thermal sensitivity of a harmonic <b>thermometer</b> (<b>probe)</b> jointly equilibrated with a reservoir (sample) by means of an Ohmic coupling scheme, displays a distinctive power-law-like behavior as T → 0. To reconcile these two results, we exploit the fact that local thermometry on a harmonic chain may be viewed as a temperature measurement on an oscillator in a discretized harmonic environment: A gapped translationally invariant chain (for which low [...] T thermometry is indeed exponentially inefficient) maps into a non-standard open-system model where the low-frequency modes of the sample decouple from the probe. On the contrary, a gapless instance of such chain gives rise to the canonical Ohmic probe-sample interaction, which does include sample modes of arbitrarily low frequency. In this way, we show that the power-law-like thermometric performance observed in typical dissipative models {{stems from the fact that}} these are gapless and, as such, not subjected to the exponential limitations of their gapped counterparts. The key feature of many-body systems, when it comes to the ultimate limitations of low [...] T thermometry, is thus whether or not their energy spectrum is gapped.

This thesis describes an experimental and analytical investigation of thermal hydraulic characteristics of low temperature helium in conventional and hybrid CICCS. Pressure drop measurements for both NET and CEA conductors have been conducted, using low temperature helium and liquid nitrogen to obtain a range of Reynolds numbers. The results are correlated with classical friction factor and Reynolds number analysis. The flow impedance reduction of the CEA conductor is described by measures of a developed flow model. Thermally induced flow in the CEA conductor has been studied with an inductive heating method. The induced velocity in the central channel is measured by a Pitot tube with steady state Reynolds number up to {approximately} 7000.

40|$|The observation, {{recording}} and appraisal of an individual’s vital signs, namely temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2), are key {{components in the}} assessment of their health and wellbeing. Measurements provide valuable diagnostic data, facilitating clinical diagnosis, management and monitoring. Respiratory rate sensing is perhaps the most under-utilised of all the vital signs, being routinely assessed by observation or estimated algorithmically from respiratory-induced beat-to-beat variation in heart rate. Moreover there is an unmet need for wearable devices that can measure all or most of the vital signs. This project therefore aims to a) develop a device that can measure respiratory rate and b) develop a wearable device that can measure all or most of the vital signs. An accelerometer-based clavicular respiratory motion sensor was developed and compared with a similar thoracic motion sensor and reference using exhalatory flow. Pilot study results established that the clavicle sensor accurately tracked the reference in monitoring respiratory rate and outperformed the thoracic device. An Ear-worn Patient Monitoring System (EPMS) was also developed, providing a discrete telemonitoring device capable of rapidly measuring tympanic temperature, heart rate, SpO 2 and activity level.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{results of}} the corrosion layers removal which could {{be found on the}} archaeological artefact surfaces. The low pressure low temperature plasma reduction was used for this purpose. Brass samples were chosen for this study. Two different ways have been used to form model corrosion layers. Several sets of corrosion layers were prepared in laboratory in two different corrosion atmospheres, namely ammonia atmosphere and atmosphere of hydrochloric acid. These samples were placed into desiccator. Small quantities of sand were added to some sets of samples so samples with sandy incrustation were prepared. The corrosion layers had been usually formed during four weeks. The second way, which was used to prepare model corrosion layer, was the natural corrosion in soil or compost. In this case, the corrosion layers had been formed approximately 2 years. The samples were treated in the low pressure (150 Pa) cylindrical Quartz reactor (90 cm long and 9. 5 cm in diameter) with a pair of external copper electrodes connected via the matching network to a radiofrequency generator (13. 56 MHz). The flows of working gases were set by independent mass flow controllers. Whole system was continuously pumped by the rotary oil pump which was separated from the discharge reactor by liquid nitrogen trap with aluminium chips eliminating dust and reactive species from the gas flow. Each sample was placed on a glass holder at the reactor center. Plasma was generated in pure hydrogen or in mixture of hydrogen and argon. Total flow of working gas was 50 sccm. Different ratios of gas mixture were tested, the ratio 30 sccm hydrogen and 20 sccm argon flows was the best. RF discharge was used in a continuous and pulsed regime. Pulsed mode was carried out with various duty cycle at the frequency of 1000 Hz. There were two ways of temperature monitoring. The sample temperature during the treatment was monitored by a K-type thermocouple installed inside the sample in the first case. <b>Thermometer</b> optical <b>probe</b> was connected to the sample surface by a small stainless plate and allowed continuous sample temperature monitoring in the second way. Safe object temperature for copper and copper alloys is 100 – 120 °C. To avoid exceeding this temperature, power control or the duty cycle in pulse mode were automatically controlled if <b>thermometer</b> optical <b>probe</b> was used. Plasma chemical treatment is based on generation of reactive atomic hydrogen in plasma discharge. The main reactions during reduction were reactions between oxygen and chloride contained in the corrosion layer and the hydrogen ions and neutral atoms generated in the plasma. These reactions create an unstable OH radical, which emits light in the region of 306 – 312 nm. This radiation was detected by the optical emission spectroscopy using Ocean Optics HR 4000 spectrometer with 2400 gr/mm grating. Data obtained from this method were used to calculate rotational temperatures and integral intensity of OH radicals that were used for the process monitoring. Corrosion layer was not completely removed during the reduction, but due to the reactions which occur in the plasma corrosion layer became brittle and after plasma chemical treatment can be removed easily.

Motility (percentage of moving sperm), velocity and duration of sperm movement before and after process of freezing were observed in common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) spermatozoa. Solutions recommended by Kopeika (1986) and Kurokura (1984) were used as a cryoprotective media. Sperm freezing was performed in 0. 5 ml straws layed in styrofoam box 3, 6 and 9 cm above the level of liquid nitrogen for 20 min. Temperature changes during process of freezing were recorded inside and outside straws using thermocouple <b>thermometer</b> with miniature <b>probes</b> T type (cuprum ? constantan). At a fi rst level (corresponding to height 3 cm above level of liquid nitrogen) we recorded lowest temperature - 170 °C, on a second (6 cm) - 110 °C and on a third level (9 cm) - 70 °C. Best results of sperm motility after freezing ? thawing were achieved using Kopeika solution and freezing at first level (3 cm above liquid nitrogen) where we reported 27 % of motile spermatozoa and velocity of movement 118 ?m. s- 1. Freezing by Kurokura solution resulted in motility 14 % and velocity 76 ?m. s- 1 whereas motility of native sperm was 88 % and velocity 136 ?m. s- 1...|$|R
40|$|Benzyl-substituted benzylpyridinium (BP) {{chloride}} salts {{were used}} {{as a source of}} <b>thermometer</b> ions to <b>probe</b> the internal energy (IE) transfer in desorption/ionization on porous silicon (DIOS). To modify their wetting properties and the interaction energies with the thermometer ions, the DIOS surfaces were silylated to produce trimethylsilyl- (TMS), amine- (NH 2), perfluoroalkyl- (PFA), and perfluorophenyl-derivatized (PFP) surfaces. Two laser sourcessa nitrogen laser with pulse length of 4 ns and a mode locked 3 ö Nd:YAG laser with a pulse length of 22 psswere utilized to induce desorption/ionization and fragmentation at various laser fluence levels. The corresponding survival yields were determined as indicators of the IE transfer and the IE distributions were extracted. In most cases, with increasing the laser fluence in a broad range (20 mJ/cm 2), no change in IE transfer was observed. For ns excitation, this was in remarkable contrast with MALDI, where increasing the laser fluence resulted in sharply (within 5 mJ/cm 2) declining survival yields. Derivatization of the porous silicon surface did not affect the survival yields significantly but had a discernible effect on the threshold fluence for ion production. The IE distributions determined for DIOS and MALDI from R-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid reveal that the mean IE value is always lower for the latter. Using the ps laser, the IE distribution is always narrower for DIOS, whereas for ns laser excitation the width depends on surface modification. Most of the differences between MALDI and DIOS described here are compatible with the different dimensionality of the plume expansion and the differences in the activation energy of desorption due to surface modifications...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of laser}} {{microprobe}} mass spectrometry (LMMS) for the structural characterization of thermolabile quaternary phosphonium salts has been evaluated. A comparison {{has been made}} between LM mass spectra obtained by direct analysis of “neat ” organic salts and the corresponding “matrix-assisted ” LM mass spectra. Main limitations of LMMS for the direct analysis of neat organic salts (i. e., no matrix) result from (1) formation of artifact ions that originate from thermal degradation and surface recombination reactions and (2) poor shot-to-shot reproducibility of the spectra. Dilution of the organic salts in a suitable, UV-absorbing matrix (e. g., nicotinic acid) significantly enhances {{the quality of the}} LM mass spectra. Improvements are: (1) an increase of the ion yield of preformed cations, (2) reduction or elimination of thermal decomposition and other deleterious surface reactions, and (3) a much better shot-to-shot spectral reproducibility. An interesting analytical feature is that these LM mass spectra, which contain only a few matrix peaks, can be obtained for subnanogram amounts of sample. The results also show that triphenylphosphonium salts with polycyclic aromatic sub-stituents can be used as “molecular <b>thermometers</b> ” to <b>probe</b> both the temperatures experi-enced by the sample molecules during the laser-induced desorption ionization process and the internal energies of the desorbed ion species. In this way, quaternary phosphonium salts can be used for evaluating whether improvements have been achieved by applying different sample treatments. Comparison of four different matrices (i. e., nicotinic acid, ammonium chloride, glycerol, and 3 -nitrobenzylalcohol) indicates that the effectiveness of a matrix to reduce thermal degradation and to decrease the internal energies of the ions depends on the UV-absorption characteristics and the volatilization/sublimation temperature of the matri...|$|R

Milne-Redh (Asteraceae) {{has been}} used as a {{medicine}} for the treatment of epilepsy, insomnia, dementia and psychotic disorders in Cameroonian traditional medicine. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was designed to examine whether the aqueous extract and the alkaloid fraction prepared from the leaves of Crassocephalum bauchiense possess antipsychotic and sedative properties in rodents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The rectal temperature of mice was recorded with a <b>probe</b> <b>thermometer</b> at a constant depth. Novelty-induced rearing behavior is used to evaluate a central excitatory locomotor behavior in mice. The antipsychotic effects of the extracts were assessed using the apomorphine animal model of psychosis. The catalepsy test was tested based on the ability of the leaves extracts of Crassocephalum bauchiense to alter the duration of akinesia by placing the naive mice with both forelegs over a horizontal bar. The extracts of Crassocephalum bauchiense effects were evaluated on sodium pentobarbital-induced sleeping time. In addition, gamma-aminobutyric acid concentrations in the brain treated mice were also estimated. RESULTS: The aqueous extract and the alkaloid fraction from Crassocephalum bauchiense caused dose-dependent inhibition of novelty-induced rearing behavior, decreased the apomorphine-induced stereotypy and fighting, and had significant fall of the body temperature. The aqueous extract prolonged the sodium pentobarbital sleeping time. This prolongation was not reversed by bicuculline, a light-sensitive competitive antagonist of GABA(A) receptors complex. However, the effect of the aqueous extract on sodium pentobarbital-induced sleeping time was blocked by N-methyl-β-carboline- 3 -carboxamide, a partial inverse agonist of the benzodiazepine site in the GABA(A) receptor complex and flumazenil, a specific antagonist of the benzodiazepine site in the GABAA receptor complex. In biochemical experiments, the concentration of the inhibitory amino acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid, was significantly increased in the brain of animals treated with the aqueous extract of Crassocephalum bauchiense and sodium valproate. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the antipsychotic and sedative properties of Crassocephalum bauchiense are possibly mediated via the blockade of dopamine D- 2 receptors and GABAergic activation, respectively. However, pharmacological and chemical studies are continuing in order to characterize the mechanism(s) responsible for these neuropharmacological actions and also to identify the active substances present in the extracts of Crassocephalum bauchiense...|$|R
