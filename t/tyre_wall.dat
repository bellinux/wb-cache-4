5|$|The safety car was {{withdrawn}} {{at the end}} of lap 31 and the race got underway again with Häkkinen in the lead. Wurz, meanwhile, immediately pulled off the circuit with a gearbox failure with Salo almost colliding with the Benetton. Light rain began to fall on lap 33. Button pitted on the following lap and his Williams pit crew changed his dry tyres to wets. Gené became the race's seventh retirement with a failed engine. All drivers, apart from Barrichello, Coulthard, Frentzen and Zonta, pitted for wet tyres. Villeneuve spun after minor contact with teammate Zonta but managed to continue. Trulli was issued with a ten-second stop-go penalty on lap 37 because he was observed overtaking Barrichello under yellow flags. He took the penalty immediately and rejoined in 11th. Zonta was also issued with a penalty but spun into the <b>tyre</b> <b>wall</b> at turn 12 and retired. Coulthard became the final driver to have pitted on the 38th lap and rejoined in fifth. Button then passed de la Rosa for sixth place.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, a further four stoppages occurred; Alex Zanardi slid and made light {{contact with the}} turn eight tire barrier and did not restart, metal debris was spotted in between turns three and four, Max Wilson stalled his car after he spun in the third turn, and Franchitti and Memo Gidley made contact in turn five and the latter was sent into the tire barrier which heavily damaged his right-hand suspension while Franchitti's right-front wheel broke. De Ferran set the fastest lap of {{the day with a}} time of 58.400 seconds, ahead of Fittipaldi and Franchitti. Kanaan was fourth-fastest; ahead of Andretti and his teammate Tracy. Da Matta, Tagliani, Max Papis and Adrián Fernández followed in the top ten. Shinji Nakano paced the final practice session with a time of 58.133 seconds; Kanaan was second and Junqueira third. De Ferran was fourth-quickest, ahead of Andretti and da Matta. Oriol Servià was seventh-fastest, Bryan Herta eighth, Fernández ninth and Maurício Gugelmin completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. The session was stopped four times: firstly for Vasser who stalled on the circuit; the second for Kanaan because his engine failed heading towards the start-finish line, the third was for Bräck who slid and hit the turn eight outside <b>tyre</b> <b>wall</b> with his left front wheel and his suspension was broken. The final red-flag was for Vasser who locked his brakes and spun 360 degrees into the turn eight run off area.|$|E
25|$|Mansell {{took part}} in the 1993 TOCA Shootout, held at Donington Park. Mansell drove a Ford Mondeo with his usual red number 5. The race ended in {{disaster}} for Mansell; he was knocked unconscious following a crash with six laps remaining. He lost control of his car through the exit of the Old Hairpin, over-corrected the slide and collided with Tiff Needell's Vauxhall Cavalier, resulting in a spin and a bad crash into the <b>tyre</b> <b>wall</b> under the bridge.|$|E
50|$|Jochen Mass and Mauro Baldi {{collided}} at Signes and Mass's car {{went through}} the catch fencing into the <b>tyre</b> <b>walls,</b> catapulted itself into the crowd and caught fire. No one was hurt, apart from Mass, who had burns on his hands. The West German driver retired from Formula One immediately after this crash.|$|R
50|$|The circuit {{is located}} two hours drive from Sydney and about one hour from Canberra, and is {{positioned}} on Braidwood Road, 10 km south of Goulburn on 130 acre of cleared land. There are no trees or natural obstacles near the track. Safety is paramount and ripple strips, <b>tyre</b> <b>walls</b> and gravel traps have been positioned {{so as to}} make Wakefield a very safe circuit on which to run any type of racecar, production car or motorcycle. The track was resurfaced by its new owners, Winton Motor Raceway, in late 2007.|$|R
2500|$|In summer 1188, Saladin {{released}} King Guy, {{the husband}} of Queen Sibylla, from captivity. A year later, in 1189, Guy, accompanied by his brother Geoffrey, appeared at Tyre and demanded that Conrad hand over {{the keys to the}} city to him. Conrad refused this demand, and declared that Guy had forfeited his rights to be king of Jerusalem at the Battle of Hattin. He said that he was holding the city until the arrival of the kings from Europe. By this, he was invoking the terms of Baldwin IV's will, terms already broken by Guy and Sibylla: in the event of the death of his nephew Baldwin V it had been Baldwin's will that Baldwin V's [...] "most rightful heirs" [...] were to hold the regency until the succession could be settled by the King of England, the King of France, and the Holy Roman Emperor. Conrad would not allow Guy and Sibylla to enter the city, but did allow them to camp outside <b>Tyre's</b> <b>walls</b> with their retainers.|$|R
25|$|At Monza's third {{practice}} session, Räikkönen {{crashed into}} the <b>tyre</b> <b>wall</b> before entering the Ascari chicane. He qualified in fifth place, and raced in the Ferrari reserve car while suffering from a neck problem. The Ferrari team employed an unusual one-stop strategy, which left him third after Hamilton passed him late in the race on fresh tyres. At Spa-Francorchamps, Räikkönen's favourite circuit, he secured pole position again and took his fourth victory of the season. Massa finished second, Alonso third and Hamilton fourth. This was also Räikkönen's third consecutive Spa win, which placed him among six other drivers with three or more Spa wins.|$|E
25|$|Lehto {{was back}} for the San Marino Grand Prix and Andrea de Cesaris would be the second driver at Jordan. However, the weekend {{got off to a}} bad start as Rubens Barrichello had a major crash during {{practice}} and was knocked unconscious. Coming too fast into Variante Bassa, his car was launched into the air by the kerb. Less than a yard from that kerb was a <b>tyre</b> <b>wall,</b> which almost instantly stopped the car's forward motion. His car was flipped over and landed upside down. Barrichello had swallowed his tongue and his life was only saved by quick action from the medical team. He would be back at the circuit on the Saturday afternoon with a fractured nose, bandaged arm and cut lip. Barrichello has never been able to recall anything from the incident.|$|E
25|$|Häkkinen and Michael Schumacher {{both made}} their pit stops on lap 39 with Häkkinen {{retaining}} the lead afterwards and Schumacher came out behind team-mate Barrichello and Montoya. On the 40th lap, Alonso, who was battling with both Benetton drivers and Bernoldi {{in the second}} Arrows for position, had his left-front wheel become detached from his Minardi close to the pit lane entry and the wheel rolled into a gravel trap before hitting a <b>tyre</b> <b>wall.</b> This resulted in his pit stop becoming longer than originally planned, Montoya, Heidfeld and Frentzen all made pit stops one lap later. Barrichello made a pit stop on lap 42 and came out holding third position ahead of Montoya and both Sauber cars. Further down the field, Bernoldi and Fisichella stopped for their second pit stops and both drivers ran side-by-side exiting the pit lane and Bernoldi slowed down to allow Fisichella to move in front. Irvine was the final driver to pit for tyres and fuel on lap 46.|$|E
50|$|A common {{feature of}} Stoisa's installations, {{is the use}} of tar as main material. In Endless Roads, the artist {{installed}} piles of rubber <b>tyres</b> against a <b>wall</b> that left a visual strip of tar creating a path throughout the gallery.|$|R
5000|$|The same line-up {{remained}} for [...] The team used the new 800cc Honda RC212V. The new motorcycle {{did not have}} the expected success right away but later in the season the motorycle was improved. Pedrosa got two race wins and finished the season runner up, while Hayden could only manage podium finishes and finished the season eighth overall. For , Pedrosa and Hayden made up the rider line-up, with Mike Leitner and Pete Benson as Pedrosa and Hayden's chief mechanics, respectively, and Kazuhiko Yamano as team manager. During the season Pedrosa switched to Bridgestone <b>tyres</b> and a <b>wall</b> was placed between the garages of Pedrosa and Hayden to prevent observation of <b>tyre</b> data. A <b>wall</b> between the same team's garages was first instituted by Rossi {{at the beginning of the}} season between himself and his teammate on Michelins, Jorge Lorenzo.|$|R
5000|$|They further noted {{about the}} water-ways: This is the spring-head which {{supplied}} ancient Tyre {{by means of}} a long aqueduct. The springs are enclosed in four strongly-built reservoirs, as at Tabghah, by means of which the water is raised to a height of from fifteen to twenty feet, in order that an aqueduct with a slight fall should be able to carry it to the neighbourhood of <b>Tyre.</b> The <b>walls</b> of these reservoirs are of large well-dressed ashlar-work, and vary in thickness. The stones are joined and coated on the inside with strong cement. The principal reservoir is octagonal in shape, with sides of irregular length. Its diameter measures sixty-six feet, and it is twenty-five feet above the ground. The retaining walls are very thick, and show traces of modern repairs in one part. They have so gentle a slope that {{it is not difficult to}} ride up on to the broad border eight feet wide round the spring." ...|$|R
25|$|Prodrive Racing Australia {{carried their}} strong form into the Winton event. Chaz Mostert claimed the opening race, his {{first for the}} season, ahead of his {{teammate}} Mark Winterbottom, while Michael Caruso claimed Nissan Motorsport's first podium finish for the year. Winterbottom won the second race of the weekend, with Rick Kelly scoring another podium for Nissan Motorsport, while Mostert finished in third place after starting from pole. The Holden Racing Team endured a difficult race after James Courtney carried too much speed into the first corner and took his teammate Garth Tander out of the race. Lee Holdsworth, driving a customer Holden Racing Team car, also suffered damage in the incident. Mostert took his fourth consecutive pole position in qualifying for the third race, becoming the first driver to achieve the feat since Winterbottom in 2011. Mostert was leading at the halfway mark of the race when he dropped his left-rear wheel onto the grass on the entry to turn four, causing him to spin into the <b>tyre</b> <b>wall.</b> Winterbottom inherited the lead {{and went on to}} win the race ahead of Fabian Coulthard and Craig Lowndes. Despite finishing on the podium, Lowndes lost the championship lead to Winterbottom.|$|E
25|$|During the German Grand Prix, it was {{announced}} that Häkkinen would remain at McLaren for 2000. Häkkinen encountered further bad fortunes in the race when his car's right rear tyre exploded at high speed, forcing his car into a 360° spin before resting on a <b>tyre</b> <b>wall.</b> He managed his fourth victory of the year at Hungary, and followed up the result with a second place in Belgium. Häkkinen retired from the following race held in Italy, due to a spin while leading the race. He finished further with fifth place at the European Grand Prix, and achieved a podium finish with third place in Malaysia. At the season finale held in Japan, Häkkinen took victory, which ensured he took enough points to win the 1999 World Championship, with 76 points, ahead of nearest rival Eddie Irvine. In November, Häkkinen was ranked seventh in the Reuters Sports Personality of the Year Poll scoring 46 out of a possible 260 points. He was also awarded his second consecutive Autosport International Racing Driver Award for 1999. In November, Häkkinen {{was announced}} as one of the seven men shortlisted for the Finnish Sports Personality of the Year. At the awards ceremony on 28 December, Häkkinen was awarded second place behind skier Mika Myllylä.|$|E
25|$|The {{qualifying}} period was {{split into two}} sessions; the first was held on Thursday afternoon and ran for 40 minutes with the second held on Friday afternoon and was similarly timed to the previous day's session. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards his final starting position for the qualification race. The first qualifying session saw Asmer {{come out on top}} with a time of two minutes and 13.122 seconds set nine minutes remaining in the session. The heavy damage to Grosjean's car forced him to sit out the session's opening minutes and gradually improved to be two-tenths adrift of Asmer and settled for provisionally second. Despite clipping the wall Yelmer Buurman ran strongly throughout and finished in third place with Buemi battling for pole position {{for the majority of the}} session until he dropped to fourth. Esteban Guerrieri made an improvement late on to end up fifth in front of Tsukakoshi in sixth and 2006 pole sitter Kamui Kobayashi stood in seventh. James Jakes, Streit and Jelley rounded out the top ten. Although he was at one point high up as fourth in the time sheets Jarvis was the quickest driver not to reach the top ten. Following him were the highest placed rookie Mortara, Oshima with Hülkenberg provisionally joining the Japanese driver on the seventh row in spite of him glancing the tyre barriers at Lisboa corner. Niall Breen was next up ahead of Atte Mustonen, Jonathan Kennard, Van Dam, Renger van der Zande and Senna. The rest of the order was completed Bird, Mailleux, Hartley, Grubmüller, Takuya Izawa, Ávila, Ho, Kit Meng. Cheong Lou Meng and the only driver to fail to record within 110% of Asmer was Merszei. Other incidents that occurred during first qualifying were Mustonen damaging his suspension against the <b>tyre</b> <b>wall</b> and Bird went into the barrier at Fisherman's Bend. Senna then crashed into the tyre barriers at San Francisco Bend and then was impacted by Izawa which prompted the waving of the red flags. After qualifying, numerous penalties were handed out. Kobayashi and Mutstonen were given three-place grid penalties for moving into the fast lane of the pit lane before it was declared open. Hülkenberg and Lou Meng were similarly penalised for ignoring the red light signal at the end of the pit lane which mandated them to enter the weighbridge.|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} tyre inner trim {{as a method}} for {{reducing}} tyre cavity resonance noise is presented. The tyre is modelled as a rectangular toroid where only the outside shell is flexible. A modal series solution of the sound pressure frequency response inside the tyre cavity {{is derived from the}} wave equation using modal superposition. In the solution with the rigid and flexible wall boundary condition, the effect of placing a trim layer onto the inner surface of the <b>tyre</b> tread plate <b>wall</b> is reflected by adding a damping loss term in the sound pressure frequency response function. The numerical simulation result was then compared with the result obtained from a roving impact test performed on a tyre. The results show that selective trim material may be effective for reducing the structure-borne noise magnitude resulting from the tyre cavity resonance...|$|R
2500|$|Räikkönen then {{achieved}} {{three consecutive}} poles in San Marino, Spain, and a win after a safety car strategy call by Neil Martin at Monaco. An almost certain win was denied at Imola after a driveshaft failure, but {{he won the}} other two races, putting him within 22 points of leader Alonso. He registered strong, comfortable wins at Barcelona, beating Alonso, and at Monte Carlo, never dropping his lead in both races. At the , Räikkönen flat-spotted his right front tyre while lapping Jacques Villeneuve. The resultant vibrations caused his suspension to fail while he led on the final lap, sending him into the <b>tyre</b> <b>wall</b> and handing a further ten points to his rival Alonso. Changing a tyre would have given him a relatively safe third place. However, tyre changes were only allowed in 2005 in cases where a [...] "punctured or damaged tyre" [...] could be changed for [...] "clear and genuine safety reasons" [...] {{and there was no}} precedent for whether the stewards would consider a flat-spotted tyre dangerous enough. This incident, in part, resulted in a rules clarification allowing teams to change a flat-spotted tyre without punishment.|$|E
2500|$|The course {{starts on}} the {{perimeter}} road outside the Top Gear studio. The first bend is a fast right-left kink named [...] "Crooner Curves." [...] "Willson Bend" [...] is the first proper turn on the track and the first corner usually seen when The Stig is lapping a car. [...] "Chicago", a long right-hand around a <b>tyre</b> <b>wall</b> onto the main runway, was designed by Lotus as a steady state corner, designed to highlight understeer or oversteer of the chassis. Next is [...] "Hammerhead", a left-then-right corner, which again highlights understeer and oversteer. The track comes to a right-hand curve, then the course turns right through the flat-out section called the [...] "Follow Through". After the left hand [...] "Bentley Bend" [...] named after the person who first [...] "discovered" [...] Jeremy Clarkson and former Top Gear presenter, Jon Bentley, but commonly referred to simply as [...] "the tyres", the course comes to [...] "Bacharach Bend", which, after the first series, {{has been referred to}} as the [...] "Penultimate Corner" [...] or the [...] "Second-to-last Corner" [...] and is often {{regarded as one of the}} most challenging on the course. The final turn before the finish line is [...] "Gambon" [...] in honour of Sir Michael Gambon, who completed the turn on two wheels in episode 8 of Series 1. Prior to this, the corner was known as [...] "Carpenters Corner".|$|E
2500|$|The Liana endured {{considerable}} {{abuse from}} the stars while undertaking their laps. In one incident, actor Michael Gambon clipped the final corner, taking the car onto two wheels. It was done in such a spectacular fashion that the corner was named [...] "Gambon Corner". When Lionel Richie drove the Liana, one of the front wheels fell off, invoking Clarkson to coin the term [...] "pulling a Lionel". Trevor Eve also lost a wheel. [...] The former British transport minister Stephen Ladyman added further injury to the Liana by denting the boot when he lost control during practice and slid backwards into a <b>tyre</b> <b>wall.</b> David Soul destroyed the gearbox of two Lianas during his time on the show due to his rough driving style. Patrick Kielty broke the Liana's front suspension during series 4 when he drove on the grass. Christopher Eccleston was the only celebrity to use a Liana with an automatic transmission, because a hesitant Eccleston admitted he was [...] "only qualified to drive an automatic." [...] To accommodate his needs, Top Gear succeeded in borrowing an automatic Liana, of which only 40 existed in the UK. As a reference to his role in Doctor Who, the automatic Liana was shown materialising onto the racing track, with a TARDIS materialisation sound effect played over it.|$|E
50|$|Chevrolet {{topped the}} final {{practice}} session, {{this time with}} Muller edging out the Polestar Racing Volvo of Dahlgren. Sonderegger brought the session to a half with twelve minutes remaining when he crashed into the <b>tyre</b> <b>wall</b> at the first corner, the session resumed once the <b>tyre</b> <b>wall</b> had been repaired.|$|E
50|$|The car was {{involved}} in an accident at the 2012 Goodwood Revival. Extensive damage occurred when the car hit a <b>tyre</b> <b>wall</b> at speed.|$|E

50|$|His second placing with {{co-driver}} Taz Douglas at the 2014 Bathurst 1000 is {{his best}} finish to date at Mount Panorama—a remarkable achievement considering his Altima {{made contact with}} the <b>tyre</b> <b>wall</b> {{at the top of}} Mountain Straight on two occasions during the race.|$|E
50|$|Griffin {{stayed with}} Motorbase in 2012, now racing under the Redstone Racing banner. He crashed {{heavily in the}} wet first race at Thruxton, his Ford Focus ending up buried in a <b>tyre</b> <b>wall.</b> He {{walked away from the}} {{incident}} but it caused the race to be stopped. He brought out the safety car at Croft after crashing his Redstone Racing Focus into the <b>tyre</b> <b>wall,</b> causing an engine fire. Griffin pulled out of the following meeting at Snetterton in order to focus on his business commitments during the 2012 Summer Olympics. He returned to the team at Silverstone and participated in the final two rounds of the season. After the final round at Brands Hatch, Griffin intended to retire from the BTCC.|$|E
50|$|The {{race was}} stopped on lap 9 after Kevin Magnussen crashed heavily at Raidillon, {{suffering}} a 12.5G impact, causing structural {{damage to the}} armoured collision barrier and <b>tyre</b> <b>wall</b> which required repairs, before the race could resume under green flag conditions. Magnussen suffered a cut on his ankle but no serious injury.|$|E
50|$|He {{was killed}} the {{following}} year when testing a GT500 category Toyota Supra at the TI Circuit, Okayama, Japan. There was a technical failure and Tachi failed to slow down for the first corner, crashing into the <b>tyre</b> <b>wall</b> at unabated speed. He suffered massive chest injuries from {{the steering wheel and}} died an hour later.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{a failure}} in his Mercedes's right front brake disc during Q1, Lewis Hamilton {{lost control of}} his vehicle and was sent into the <b>tyre</b> <b>wall</b> of the left-handed Sachs Kurve. He was {{consigned}} to start 20th on the grid, his teammate Nico Rosberg snatching the pole. The crash left Hamilton [...] "ok but sore", and he managed to participate on Sunday.|$|E
5000|$|... 1997 : Test tracks now require FIA {{approval}} and supervision, kerbing standardised, bolted <b>tyre</b> <b>wall</b> construction obligatory, cars to carry FIA ADR (accident data recorder) to analyse success of implemented safety measures, FIA approval required for all chief medical officers and medical centres, safety car made {{more powerful and}} may now be used for wet weather starts, accident intervention plan revised.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, Chen was {{recruited}} by Mopar Racing (Chrysler) after his brilliant {{performance in the}} SCCA Year-End Runoffs. Chen qualified in 4th, but crashed into the <b>tyre</b> <b>wall</b> during the first lap due to the wet track. He fell to last position with the car in bad shape, but he still managed to fight back, and finished the race in 7th, passing 30 cars in the process.|$|E
50|$|While {{competing}} in a Supertouring race in 1995 at Phillip Island, Hansford's Ford Mondeo {{slid off the}} track and hit a <b>tyre</b> <b>wall</b> at high speed. The car bounced back onto the track where {{he was hit by}} Mark Adderton's Peugeot 405 at over 200 km/h. Hansford died moments after the impact. At the time of his death, Gregg's youngest son Harrison, born to model Carolyn Donovan, was only 8 months old.|$|E
50|$|The {{second session}} {{was marked by}} an {{accident}} in the final few minutes, with Vitaly Petrov slipping into the <b>tyre</b> <b>wall</b> at Ste. Devote, though the session was not stopped. His time was fast enough for fourteenth although Nico Hülkenberg, Adrian Sutil and Sébastien Buemi all qualified ahead of Petrov, with Pedro de la Rosa, Kamui Kobayashi and Jaime Alguersuari also being eliminated. Mercedes' Nico Rosberg was the fastest man in the session.|$|E
5000|$|On Lap 33, the Safety Car was {{deployed}} after [...] Morad {{lost control}} and spun {{into the back}} of [...] Ho-Pin Tung, sending both cars into the <b>tyre</b> <b>wall</b> at Tarzan corner.
