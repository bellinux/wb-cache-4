40|$|<b>Thio–ether</b> {{bonds in}} the cysteinyl side chain of peptides, formed {{with the most}} {{commonly}} used cysteine blocking reagent iodoacetamide, after conversion to sulfoxide, releases a neutral fragment mass in a low-energy MS/MS experiment in the gas phase of the mass spectrometer [6]. In this study, we show that the neutral loss fragments produced from the mono-oxidized <b>thio–ether</b> bonds (sulfoxide) in peptides, formed by alkyl halide or double-bond containing cysteine blocking reagents are different under low-energy MS/MS conditions. We have evaluated the low-energy fragmentation patterns of mono-oxidized modified peptides with different cysteine blocking reagents, such as iodoacetamide, 3 -maleimidopropionic acid, and 4 -vinylpyridine using FTICR-MS. We propose that the mechanisms of gas-phase fragmentation of mono-oxidized <b>thio–ether</b> bonds in the side chain of peptides, formed by iodoacetamide and double-bond containing cysteine blocking reagents, maleimide and vinylpyridine, are different because of the availability of acidic β-hydrogens in these compounds. Moreover, we investigated the fragmentation characteristics of mono-oxidized <b>thio–ether</b> bonds within the peptide sequence to develop novel mass-spectrometry identifiable chemical cross-linkers. This methionine type of oxidized <b>thio–ether</b> bond within the peptide sequence did not show anticipated low-energy fragmentation. Electron capture dissociation (ECD) of the side chain <b>thio–ether</b> bond containing oxidized peptides was also studied. ECD spectra of the oxidized peptides showed a greater extent of peptide backbone cleavage, compared with CID spectra. This fragmentation information is critical to researchers for accurate data analysis of this undesired modification in proteomics research, as well as other methods that may utilize sulfoxide derivatives...|$|E
40|$|Benzimidazole {{units have}} been grafted onto a {{polysulfone}} (PSU) backbone via long alkyl <b>thio–ether</b> chains using a two-step procedure. In the first step, lithiated PSU was reacted with 10 -undecenoyl chloride to graft PSU with undecenoyl side chains. The second step involved a free-radical thiol–ene coupling reaction between the C=C bonds of the pendant undecenoyl chains and 2 -(2 -benzimidazolyl) ethanethiol. In this reaction, all the C=C bonds were converted into <b>thio–ether</b> linkages without any detectable structural degradation, as confirmed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy and size-exclusion chromatography. The procedure constitutes a convenient and general pathway to attach functional or mesogenic groups to PSU via long flexible spacers. Thermogravimetry {{showed that the}} benzimidazole-functionalized polymers were stable up to 250 °C under nitrogen atmosphere, and that the first degradation step was attributed to the cleavage of the <b>thio–ether</b> bond. While the grafting of the undecenoyl side chains was found to significantly decrease the glass transition temperature (Tg), the subsequent tethering of the benzimidazole only slightly increased the Tg of the grafted PSU backbone. The concentration of benzimidazole was probably too low {{for the formation of}} a percolating benzimidazole domain. This explains the quite modest proton conductivity measured under completely dry conditions, e. g. 34 nS/cm at 180 °C for a polymer functionalized with 1. 7 benzimidazole units per repeating unit of PSU...|$|E

40|$|The multidentate compound, tris-(o-butylthiobenzyl) - aminoethylamine (L), which {{contains}} four nitrogen and three sulfur donors has been synthesised by combining 2 -amino-methyl- 1, 3 -diamino-propane (tren) with o-butylthiobenzaldehyde. L has been reacted with the nitrate salts of nickel, copper and zinc {{to give a}} series of L M(NO) complexes which were crystallographically characterised. In all cases the metal binds to the N motif proffered by the tren moiety. The nickel complex achieves a hexacoordinate geometry by ligating with a didentate (-O,O′) nitrate. Copper and zinc both produced five coordinate species by ligating with a unidentate nitrate. None of the species reported include the <b>thio-ethers</b> in the coordination sphere of the metal. Replacing nitrate with nitrite in the copper system allows the synthesis of a five coordinate unidentate, oxygen bound, nitrite complex. A number of unsuccessful attempts have been made, using Cd, Pb and Au, to assemble the three thioethers groups into a secondary coordination motif for metals. These reactions produce a series of LM-halide complexes which have again been crystallographically characterised...|$|R
40|$|Me-acr can {{be absorbed}} totally after dermal, and oral exposure. Me-acr is metabolized fairly rapidly and {{elimination}} occurs {{for a large}} part via exhalation of CO 2 {{and to a lesser}} extent via urinary excretion of <b>thio-ethers.</b> Me-acr is irritant to corrosive to the skin. Skin sensitization and cross sensitization to some of the related compounds occurs. In a two-year inhalatory study in rats (highest dose tested: 483 mg/m 3) no signs of systemic toxicity or carcinogenicity are observed. Dose-related changes are observed in the nasal mucosas. The lowest dose tested (54 mg/m 3 = 15 ppm) induces a slight effect on the respiratory and olfactory nasal mucose. Me-acr induces mutations and chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells in vitro. However, in view of the abovementioned local effects these results are considered irrelevant for the MAC evaluation. Since rats ar obligatory nasal breathers this region has a higher sensitivity and this fact has little significance for the extrapolation to humans. To take into account intraspecies variation a safety factor of 3 is introduced. An occupational exposure limit of 18 mg/m 3 (5 ppm) TWA 8 hr is recommended.

A rapid, autologous red cell agglutination test for antibodies to FIV has been developed. A synthetic peptide analog corresponding to the immunodominant epitope within the FIV transmembrane glycoprotein gp 40 residues (680 - 715) KVEAMEKFLYTAFAMQELGC (Acm) NQNQFFK(BrAc) KIPLELWTR was conjugated to an anti-feline erythrocyte antibody using a <b>thio-ether</b> linkage. Within 3 min of adding this reagent to 20 μl of whole blood, circulating antibody to the peptide epitope caused agglutination of the red blood cells. The performance of this simple test is comparable with the two commercially available enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kits and an EIA based on this peptide.

Both pigments have been extracted, together with flavins rich in flavinadenine dinucleotide; an electrophoretically and chromatographically pure preparation of the cytochrome has been obtained and is designated c 3. The green protein has been termed ‘ desulphoviridin ’. Cytochrome c 3 is a soluble autoxidizible thennostable haemoprotein (reduced bands a t 553, 525 and 419 nip.) of low redox potential (- 205 mV.), high iso-electric point (pH> 10) and containing 0. 9 yo Fe.

In vitro binding experiments demonstrated a saturable and specific interaction of CC 52 -immunoliposomes, {{which could be}} inhibited by free non-coupled CC 52 but not by irrelevant antibodies. The in vivo targeting potential of CC 52 -immunoliposomes, which were pegylated to achieve prolonged circulation times, was tested in an established rat liver CC 531 metastasis model. Twenty-four hours after injection of the liposomes, 25 % of the CC 52 -immunoliposomes were still present in the blood, which was comparable with the control liposomes (either with or without antibody). Liposomes were mainly taken up from the blood by the liver and the spleen, although hepatic uptake of the immunoliposomes was higher and splenic uptake was lower as compared to liposomes without antibody. Within the metastatic tumor nodules in the liver, uptake of both the CC 52 -immunoliposomes and non-specific immunoliposomes {{was significantly higher than}} that of control liposomes without antibody. Visualization of fluorescently or gold labeled CC 52 -immunoliposomes revealed that, although targeting to liver metastases was achieved, the immunoliposomes were mostly not associated with tumor cells but rather localized in tumor associated cells, probably macrophages...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the heteroatom analogues of the monosaccharide Dgalactofuranose and its alditol, a mild Pummerer-like reaction of seleno-and <b>thio-ethers,</b> and {{the synthesis of}} the first seleno sugar derivative. D-Galactofuranose (Galj) {{is present in the}} cell walls of mycobacteria and other microorganisms such as protozoa and fungi. These microorganisms are responsible for a variety of life-threatening diseases, and Galf is known to be crucial for their survival, pathogenicity, or infectivity. The syntheses of potential inhibitors of the enzymes UDPgalactopyranose mutase and UDP-galactofuranosyltransferase that are responsible for the formation and incorporation of Galf, respectively, in cell walls of microorganisms are described. The compounds were intended to mimic the oxacarbenium ion transition state in the enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Two ammonium salts of 1, 4 -dideoxy- 1, 4 -imino-Dgalactitol, a known inhibitor of the enzyme UDP-galactopyranose mutase, as well as their selenonium analogues, derived from 1, 4 -dideoxy- 1, 4 -seleno-D-galactitol were synthesized. Both series of compounds contained a pendant polyhydroxylated alkyl chain with a sulfate counterion. Progress towards the synthesis of the 4 -thio-analogue of UDPgalactofuranose, a potential inhibitor or substrate for the enzyme UDP-Galp mutase, is also described. The Pummerer rearrangements of carbohydrate-based heterocycles containing sulfur and selenium were investigated. Ozonization of 1, 4 anhydro-D- galactitol or 1, 5 anhydroxylitol derivatives containing sulfur or selenium as the ring heteroatom gave unstable intermediates, that were attributed to ozonides. These intermediates decomposed upon warming to give selenoxides or sulfoxides. Addition of acetic anhydride at low temperature to the ozonization reaction mixtures gave Pummerer-rearrangement-products after warming to ambient temperature, in contrast to the much higher reaction temperatures required for rearrangement of the isolated selenoxides or sulfoxides. The mechanism of the rearrangement, probed by trapping experiments with rubrene, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies with the radical trap 5, 5 -dimethy- 1 - pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), is consistent with the intermediacy of radical species in the rearrangement. Finally, the synthesis of the hitherto unknown 4 -seleno-D-galactofuranose is described. The synthesis represents the first of a selenosugar. A preliminary study of 4 - seleno-D-galactofuranosyl derivatives as glycosyl donors is also described...|$|R
40|$|The microsomal epoxide {{hydrolase}} (mEH) plays {{a significant}} role in the metabolism of xenobiotics such as polyaromatic toxicants. Additionally, polymorphism studies have underlined a potential role of this enzyme in relation to a number of diseases, such as emphysema, spontaneous abortion, eclampsia, and several forms of cancer. We recently demonstrated that fatty amides, such as elaidamide, represent a new class of potent inhibitors of mEH. While these compounds are very active on recombinant mEH in vitro, they are quickly inactivated in liver extracts reducing their value in vivo. We investigated the effect of structural changes on mEH inhibition potency and microsomal stability. Results obtained indicate that the presence of a small alkyl group R to the terminal amide function and a <b>thio-ether</b> to this function increased mEH inhibition by an order of magnitude while significantly reducing microsomal inactivation. The addition of a hydroxyl group 9 - 10 carbons from the terminal amide function resulted in better inhibition potency without improving microsomal stability. The best compound obtained, 2 -nonylsulfanyl-propionamide, is a competitive inhibitor of mEH with a KI of 72 nM. Furthermore, this new inhibitor significantly reduces mEH diol production in ex vivo lungs exposed to naphthalene, underlying the usefulness of the inhibitors described herein. These novel inhibitors could be valuable tools to investigate the physiological and biological roles of mEH...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAntimicrobial {{peptides}} encompass a {{wide variety}} of structural motifs. Many peptides have α-helical structures. The majority of these peptides are cationic and amphipathic but there are also hydrophobic α-helical peptides which possess antimicrobial activity. In addition, some β-sheet peptides have antimicrobial activity and even antimicrobial α-helical peptides which have been modified to possess a β-structure retain part of their antimicrobial activity. There are also antimicrobial peptides which are rich in a certain specific amino acid such as Trp or His. In addition, antimicrobial peptides exist with <b>thio-ether</b> rings, which are lipopeptides or which have macrocyclic Cys knots. In spite of the structural diversity, a common feature of the cationic antimicrobial peptides is that they all have an amphipathic structure which allows them to bind to the membrane interface. Indeed, most antimicrobial peptides interact with membranes and may be cytotoxic as a result of disturbance of the bacterial inner or outer membranes. Alternatively, a necessary but not sufficient property of these peptides may be to be able to pass through the membrane to reach a target inside the cell. The interaction of these peptides with biological membranes is not just a function of the peptide but is also modulated by the lipid components of the membrane. It is not likely that this diverse group of peptides has a single mechanism of action, but interaction of the peptides with membranes is an important requirement for most, if not all, antimicrobial peptides...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of biological therapeutics has advanced medicine {{dramatically in the}} 20 th century. Protein-based drugs are now commonly used in treatment of disease. Technologies to improve the pharmacokinetic properties of these drugs are {{at the cutting edge}} of research within the pharmaceutical industry. I have evaluated a novel thiol-selective specific linker (PermaLinkTM,, Glythera Ltd) for the attachment of chemical groups such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) to cysteine via a stable <b>thio-ether</b> bond. Proteins are often PEGylated to improve their serum half-life, reduce their immunogenicity and prevent renal clearance by increasing their overall size. The linkers which attach these PEG molecules to a protein are an essential part of this modification as these affect where the molecule is attached and consequently whether the protein stays biologically active. In this study, I have compared PermaLinkTM-PEG with commercially available maleimide-PEG for the attachment of PEG groups to proteins. Initially I established a protocol to reduce the test protein prior to reaction with PermaLinkTM-PEG or maleimide-PEG. Agarose resin-linked Tris(2 -carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) was used to reduce cysteines prior to the addition of thiol-reactive compounds. Using this reduction approach, I observed that PermaLinkTM-PEG demonstrated an increased apparent cystiene selectively compared to maleimide-PEG. PermaLinkTM-PEG attached the predicted number of PEG molecules based on the number of available cysteines while non-specific multi-pegylation was observed with maleimide-PEG. Based on my results I propose that PermaLinkTM-PEG selectively targets cysteine thiol groups compared to maleimide-PEG. Overall I propose that PermaLinkTM technology could be used to develop new therapeutic proteins with reduced non-specific PEGylation...|$|E
40|$|Until now, petrochemical-based {{plastics}} {{have been}} extensively used as packaging materials {{thanks to their}} low cost and excellent physic-mechanical properties. Unfortunately, as it is well-known, these materials are not readily degraded in the environments where they are disposed once their function has ended. As a consequence, {{thousands of tons of}} plastic packaging are disposed in landfills every year, causing a continuous pollution increment. In this view, replacing non-degradable plastics based on fossil oil with sustainable bio-based, biodegradable materials for short time applications is of great environmental importance. Among biobased and biodegradable plastic packaging materials, one of the most economically competitive polymer class is represented by aliphatic polyesters, that have attracted considerable attention in last decades as they combine the afore mentioned features with interesting physical and chemical properties. In this framework, the present research work focused on the modification of some interesting aliphatic polyesters, in order to prepare new materials, which guarantee full compostability and offer suitable characteristics, especially in terms of mechanical and barrier properties to be used in food packaging applications. Simple, ecofriendly, cost-effective synthetic strategies have been employed to obtain the designed materials. All the synthesized polymers have been deeply characterized by the molecular, thermal and mechanical point of view. Moreover, their barrier properties have been studied to prove their suitability for packaging applications. Lastly, lab-scale composting experiments have been carried out, in order to check their potential compostability. Solid-state properties and biodegradation rate can be tailored acting on chemical structure, copolymer composition and polymer architecture: in particular, the introduction of different amounts of ether- or <b>thio-ether</b> linkages or short ramifications along macromolecular backbone of parent homopolymer, or simply acting on soft/hard ratio in block structures permitted to modulate mechanical behaviour and biodegradation rate of the parent homopolymer itself, without compromising the good properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of {{two sets of}} different orthogonally protected lanthionine ready for incorporation into solid phase peptide synthesis to form cyclised peptides is described in this thesis, along with the cyclisation of individual rings D and E and the overlapping rings D and E. Previously developed orthogonally protected lanthionine containing Aloc, allyl, Fmoc and tBu protecting groups was synthesised using published synthetic route developed by Tabor’s group. A novel orthogonally protected lanthionine containing Teoc, TMSE, Fmoc and Tce group derivative has also been synthesised, after carrying several synthetic pathways. Both lanthionine residues contain protecting groups which are orthogonal to each other, which are also orthogonal to the transient Fmoc and permanent Boc/tBu protecting groups which are used in Fmoc based solid phase peptide synthesis. Incorporation of the previously developed lanthionine with Aloc/allyl protecting groups was carried out to form an analogue of ring E of nisin for the first time. Deprotection of the Aloc/allyl protecting groups were carried out with Ph(PPh 3) 4 using N’,N-dimethyl-barbituric acid (NDMBA). The second orthogonally protected lanthionine was also incorporated into solid phase peptide synthesis to synthesise an analogue of ring D of nisin. This was also to see whether this {{can be used to}} synthesise lanthionine-containing <b>thio-ether</b> bridged cyclic peptide by solid phase peptide synthesis. Teoc and TMSE deprotection was carried out in the presence of TBAF without effecting the other side chain and Fmoc protecting groups. Full characterisation of individual rings D and E were obtained. Quadruply orthogonal protecting group strategy was used to synthesise bicyclic peptide with two overlapping lanthionine bridges rings D and E.

40|$|The C {{terminus}} of the {{influenza virus}} hemagglutinin (HA) contains three cysteine residues {{that are highly}} conserved among HA subtypes, two in the cytoplasmic tail {{and one in the}} transmembrane domain. All of these C-terminal cysteine residues are modified by the covalent addition of palmitic acid through a <b>thio-ether</b> linkage. To investigate the role of HA palmitylation in virus assembly, we used reverse genetics technique to introduce substitutions and deletions that affected the three conserved cysteine residues into the H 3 subtype HA. The rescued viruses contained the HA of subtype H 3 (A/Udorn/ 72) in a subtype H 1 helper virus (A/WSN/ 33) background. Rescued viruses which do not contain a site for palmitylation (by residue substitution or substitution combined with deletion of the cytoplasmic tail) were obtained. Rescued virions had a normal polypeptide composition. Analysis of the kinetics of HA low-pH-induced fusion of the mutants showed no major change from that of virus with wild-type (wt) HA. The PFU/HA ratio of the rescued viruses grown in eggs ranged from that of virus with wt HA to 16 -fold lower levels, whereas the PFU/HA ratio of the rescued viruses grown in MDCK cells varied only 2 -fold from that of virus with wt HA. However, except for one rescued mutant virus (CAC), the mutant viruses were attenuated in mice, as indicated by a > or = 400 -fold increase in the 50 % lethal dose. Interestingly, except for one mutant virus (CAC), all of the rescued mutant viruses were restricted for replication in the upper respiratory tract but much less restricted in the lungs. Thus, the HA cytoplasmic tail may play a very important role in the generation of virus that can replicate in multiple cell types...|$|E
40|$|Polymer {{nanocomposite}} {{technology has}} had {{significant impact on}} material design. With the environmental advantages of photopolymerization, a research has recently focused on producing nanocomposites utilizing inexpensive clay particles based on in situ photopolymerization. In this research, novel polymerizable organoclays and thiol-ene photopolymerization have been utilized to develop advanced photopolymer clay nanocomposites and to overcome several limitations in conventional free radical photopolymers. To this end, factors important in nanocomposite processes such as monomer composition, clay dispersion, and photopolymerization behavior {{in combination with the}} evolution of ultimate nanocomposite properties have been investigated. For monomer-organoclay compositions, higher chemical compatibility of components induces enhanced clay exfoliation, resulting in photopolymerization rate increases due to an amplified clay template effect. Additionally, by affecting the stoichiometric ratio between thiol and acrylate double bond in the clay gallery, thiolated organoclays enhance thiol-ene copolymerization with increased final thiol conversion while acrylated organoclays encourage acrylate homopolymerization. In accordance with the reaction behavior, incorporation of thiolated organoclays makes polymer chains more flexible with decreased glass transition temperature due to higher formation of <b>thio-ether</b> linkages while adding acrylated organoclays significantly increases the modulus. Photopolymer nanocomposites also help overcome two major drawbacks in conventional free radical photopolymerization, namely severe polymerization shrinkage and oxygen inhibition during polymerization. With addition of a low level of thiol monomers, the oxygen inhibition in various acrylate systems can be overcome by addition of only 5 wt% thiolated organoclay. The same amount of polymerizable organoclay also induces up to 90 % decreases in the shrinkage stress for acrylate or thiol-acrylate systems. However, nonreactive clays do not reduce the stress substantially and even decreases the polymerization rate in air. Additionally, the clay morphology and polymerization behavior are closely related with evolution of ultimate nanocomposite performance. Use of polymerizable organoclay significantly improves overall toughness of nanocomposites by increasing either modulus or elongation at break based on the type of polymerizable organoclay, which demonstrates the promise of this technology as a modulation and/or optimization tool for nanocomposite properties...|$|E
40|$|Controlled {{polymerisation}} {{techniques have}} increased the level of structural and chemical sophistication possible in modern synthetic polymers. This has led to advanced properties and applications in fields as diverse as energy production, medicine and electronics. This study aims to further extend the scope of two such techniques, ROMP (ring-opening metathesis polymerisation) and ADMET (acyclic diene metathesis), by combining them with thiol-based click chemistries. An arguable limitation of these polymerisations is their lack of commercially available functional substrates. A nucleophilic thiol-Michael reaction was used to conjugate a library of thiols to an exo- 7 -oxanorbornene and an α,ω-diene precursor via their acrylic pendants. This allowed the expedient synthesis of 18 novel ROMP monomers and 9 novel ADMET monomers with different polarities, steric characteristics and chemical groups. Homopolymerisation was carried out with Grubbs’ 1 st or 3 rd generation catalysts, {{and in the case}} of ROMP, proceeded in a controlled manner. Low dispersities, the linear evolution of molecular weight and the successful preparation of AB di-block copolymers indicated pseudo-living polymerisation. Due to the gradual coordination and deactivation of Ru-based catalysts with <b>thio-ether</b> moieties, an additional protective oxidation step was required for slower ADMET polymerisations to reach high conversion. Thiol-based chemistries were also employed for post-polymerisation modification. The unsaturated backbone of a representative poly(exo- 7 -oxanorbornene) was quantitatively modified with 16 functional thiols via radical initiated hydrothiolation without disrupting the well-defined structure of the parent polymer. Monomers bearing latent acrylic ene and trimethylsilane protected alkyne pendants were also synthesised, (co) polymerised and modified with thiol-Michael, thiol-yne, CuAAC and Diels Alder chemistry. Finally, novel organic-inorganic hybrids were prepared via in-situ and simultaneous ROMP and sol-gel processes. Although the hydrophobicity of conventional polynorbornene caused phase separation, well dispersed titania nano-composites were achieved using functional exo- 7 -oxanorbornene thiol-Michael adducts. The combination of thiol-based click chemistry, metathesis polymerisation and sol-gel condensation was shown to be compatible and highly effective for the preparation of polymeric materials with advanced architectures and tailored chemical functionality...|$|E
40|$|This work {{comprises}} the manufacture and characterization of solid polymer lithium ion conducting electrolytes for structural batteries. In the study, polymer films are produced in situ via a rapid versatile UV irradiation polymerization route, in which ethylene oxide methacrylates are polymerized into thermoset networks. In {{the first part}} of the study, the simplicity and efficiency of this manufacturing route is emphasized. Polymer electrolytes are pro-duced with an ionic conductivity ranging from 5. 8 × 10 - 10 S cm- 1 up to 1. 5 × 10 - 6 S cm- 1, and a storage modulus of up to 2 GPa at 20 °C. In the sec-ond part, the effect of the lithium salt content is studied, both for tightly crosslinked systems with a glass transition temperature (Tg) above room temperature but also for sparsely crosslinked system with a Tg below. It is shown that for these systems, there is a threshold amount of 4 % lithium salt by weight, above which the ion conducting ability is not affected to a larger extent when the salt content is increased further. It is also shown that the influence of the salt content on the ionic conductivity is similar within both systems. However, the Tg is more affected by the addition of lithium salt for the loosely crosslinked system, and since the Tg is the main affecting parame-ter of the conductivity, the salt content plays a larger role here. In the third part of the study, a thiol functional compound is added via thiol-ene chemistry to create <b>thio-ether</b> segments in the polymer network. This is done in order to expand the toolbox of possible building blocks usable in the design of structural electrolytes. It is shown that solid polymer electrolytes of more homogeneous networks with a narrower glass transition region can be produced this way, and that they have the ability to function as an electrolyte. Finally, the abilities of reinforcing the electrolytes by nano fibrilar cellulose are investigated, by means to improve the mechanical properties without decreasing the ionic conductivity at any larger extent. These composites show conductivity values close to 10 - 4 S cm- 1 and a storage modulus around 400 MPa at 25 °C. QC 20140410 </p...|$|E
40|$|Lantibiotics form a {{group of}} {{modified}} peptides with unique structures, containing post-translationally modified amino acids such as dehydrated and lanthionine residues. In the gram-positive bacteria that secrete these lantibiotics, the gene clusters flanking the structural genes for various linear (type A) lantibiotics have recently been characterized. The best studied representatives are those of nisin (nis), subtilin (spa), epidermin (epi), Pep 5 (pep), cytolysin (cyl), lactocin S (las) and lacticin 481 (lct). Comparison of the lantibiotic gene clusters shows that they contain conserved genes that probably encode similar functions. The nis, spa, epi and pep clusters contain lanB and lanC genes that are presumed to code for two types of enzymes that have been implicated in the modification reactions characteristic of all lantibiotics, i. e. dehydration and <b>thio-ether</b> ring formation. The cyl, las and lct gene clusters have no homologue of the lanB gene, but they do contain a much larger lanM gene that is the lanC gene homologue. Most lantibiotic gene clusters contain a lanP gene encoding a serine protease that is presumably involved in the proteolytic processing of the prelantibiotics. All clusters contain a lanT gene encoding an ABC transporter likely {{to be involved in}} the export of (precursors of) the lantibiotics. The lanE, lanF and lanG genes in the nis, spa and epi clusters encode another transport system that is possibly involved in self-protection. In the nisin and subtilin gene clusters two tandem genes, lanR and lanK, have been located that code for a two-component regulatory system. Finally, non-homologous genes are found in some lantibiotic gene clusters. The nisI and spaI genes encode lipoproteins that are involved in immunity, the pepI gene encodes a membrane-located immunity protein, and epiD encodes an enzyme involved in a post-translational modification found only in the C-terminus of epidermin. Several genes of unknown function are also found in the las gene cluster. A database has been assembled for all putative gene products of type A lantibiotic gene clusters. Database searches, multiple sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction have been used to identify conserved sequence segments in the LanB, LanC, LanE, LanF, LanG, LanK, LanM, LanP, LanR and LanT gene products that may be essential for structure and function. This database allows for a rapid screening of newly determined sequences in lantibiotic gene clusters. ...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogels have {{successfully}} proved themselves useful for drug delivery applications and several delivery routes {{have been developed}} over the years. The particular interest in this work was to design, synthesise and evaluate in situ forming drug eluting hydrogels, which {{have the potential to}} ameliorate the healing of cardiovascular diseases. With this aim the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant drugs rapamycin (Ra) and dexamethasone (Dex) were made water soluble by conjugation with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Ra was attached pendant from the terminal of PEGs while Dex was incorporated into dendritic structures grown from PEGs. These conjugates were further crosslinked into hydrogels by either conjugate or thiol-ene addition. The gel degradation was tuned to take between 5 and 27 days by using gel building block combinations that induced either 2 or 4 hydrolytically labile bonds per crosslink or by varying the number of crosslinking sites of the building blocks. The use of thiol-ene addition prolonged the degradation time nearly seven folded compared to conjugate addition as a more stable crosslink was formed. Two different formulations for gelling via conjugate addition were used (acrylate-thiol or vinyl sulphone-thiol) to deliver Ra, which was carried by either a 4 - or 2 -armed PEG. The elution kinetic for the respective gel formulation was of zero order during 15 and 19 days of gel degradation. In addition, Ra was PEGylated via esters, with a distance of either one or two carbons to a nearby <b>thio-ether</b> functionality. The difference in ester conjugation resulted in a slight but significant change in drug-PEG conjugate stability, which was mirrored by the increased time to reach the half amount of total drug elution; from 9. 3 to 10. 2 days and from 5. 1 to 9. 7 days for the two gel formulations, respectively. Dexamethasone was incorporated via an ester into dendrons of first and second generation pending from 2 - and 4 -armed PEGs at loadings of 2, 4 or 6 Dex molecules per carrier molecule. The resulting elution kinetic was of zero order during degradation periods of 5 - 27 days. Released Dex still possessed biological activity as determined by an in vitro cell assay. The novelties in this thesis are: (A) slow release of rapamycin obtained by covalent incorporation into hydrogels, (B) the use of unique PEG-based dendrimers to incorporate dexamethasone into a hydrogel and (C) zero order sustained release of dexamethasone at physiological pH. Hydrogeler har framgångsrikt visat sig användbara för att leverera läkemedel och ett flertal metoder har utvecklats de senaste 20 åren. Fokuset i den här avhandlingen ligger på att designa, framställa och utvärdera läkemedelsutsöndrande hydrogeler som spontanhärdar in situ, vilka har potential att förbättra läkningen efter kardiovaskulär sjukdom. Med det syftet gjordes de anti-inflammatoriska och immunsänkande läkemedlen rapamycin (Ra) och dexametason (Dex) vattenlösliga genom att konjugeras med polyetylenglygol (PEG). Ra fästes kovalent längst ut på PEGar medans Dex inkluderades i dendritiska strukturer vilka byggdes från ändpunkten av PEGar. De här konjugaten tvärbands till hydrogeler via antingen konjugerad addition eller radikal polymerisation. Nedbrytningen av gelerna trimmades till att ta mellan 5 och 27 dagar genom att använda kombinationer av gelbyggstenar som bildar antingen 2 eller 4 hydrolyserbara estrar per tvärbindning eller genom att variera antalet tvärbindningspunkter hos byggstenarna. Användandet av radikal polymerisation i sig ledde till att nedbrytningen av geler tog nära sju gånger längre tid jämfört med geler gjorda via konjugerad addition eftersom stabilare tvärbindningar då formas. Två olika kombinationer för härdning via konjugerad addition (akryl-tiol eller vinylsulfon-tiol) användes för att leverera Ra som bars av antingen en 4 - eller 2 -armad PEG. Utsöndringskinetiken av Ra för de två kombinationerna var av nollte ordningen under de 15 och 19 dagar som gelerna degraderade. Dessutom, Ra PEGylerades via estrar med ett avstånd på antingen ett eller två kol till en närliggande tioeter. Skillnaden i avstånd ledde till en liten men signifikant skillnad i stabiliteten hos Ra-PEG konjugaten, vilket speglades i den förlängda tiden att nå halva mängden av den totala läkemedelsutsöndringen; från 9. 3 till 10. 2 dagar och från 5. 1 till 9. 7 dagar för de två respektive gelkombinationerna. Dex kopplades in via en esterbindning till dendroner av första och andra generationen byggda från PEGar med 2 eller 4 armar, vilket resulterade i att 2, 4 eller 6 Dex levererades per bärarmolekyl. Dex eluerade med nollte ordningens kinetik under degraderingsperioder på mellan 5 och 27 dagar. Vidbehålllen biologisk aktivitet av eluerad Dex bekräftades genom cellexperiment in vitro. Nyheterna i den här avhandlingen består av: (A) kontrollerad utsöndring av rapamycin uppnådd genom kovalent inbindning till hydrogeler, (B) användandet av unika PEGbaserade dendrimerer för kovalent inbindning av dexametason till hydrogeler och (C) nollte ordningens utsöndring av dexametason vid fysiologiskt pH.
