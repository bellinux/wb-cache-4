50|$|Situated in {{the tidal}} stream of the Pentland Firth, a tidal race is present {{at both the}} north and south ends of the island, being minimal briefly {{at the turn of the}} <b>tide.</b> Between the <b>races</b> is a calm eddy which extends down-tide as the <b>tide</b> strengthens. The <b>races</b> are highly visible, with over-falls and whirlpools. Large swell waves can also be present, {{especially}} in bad weather conditions.

50|$|Findhorn Bay {{is a large}} sandy estuary with {{a narrow}} {{entrance}} that is some 3 km wide and long at its greatest extent. Most of the bay dries at low tide but a deep channel from {{the entrance to the}} bay leads eastward to the boatyard and then south past the village piers and RFYC premises. There are visitor's moorings and water and electricity is available at the north pier, which dries. The entrance to the bay itself provides navigational challenges. A long sandy bar stretches from east to west making an entrance at lower stages of the tide hazardous if not impossible. Inshore from the bar there is a shallow lagoon, which contains extensive mussel beds. At higher stages of the tide the channel admits larger craft, although the <b>tide</b> <b>race</b> can be strong.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} the larger island, the place names are mostly English with the {{exception}} of Camper on the south-east coast (meaning <b>tide</b> <b>race</b> or roost in Cornish) and Porthmoren, a place on the west of the shingle and boulder bar that separates the two islands. In Cornish moren is a girl, or maiden, and porth is a landing place. The north-west of the island rises to a height of 21 m and is topped by a ruined entrance grave. There are also other ancient monuments, including a chambered cairn and several other cairns, To the south, and sheltered by the hill, are six small mounds or cairns. Two walls indicating a bank and ditch field system are also present. An examination of one cairn in 1975 showed that it was about 3 m across, possibly double walled on the north side and probably too small to be a hut circle. Only part of the island is scheduled as an Ancient Monument, but the county archaeological unit has recommended that the whole island should be scheduled.|$|E
5000|$|Spuyten Duyvil Creek runs {{northeast}} {{into the}} Hudson. When the Dutch settlers arrived they found its tidal waters turbulent {{and difficult to}} handle. Though its <b>tides</b> <b>raced</b> there was no navigable watercourse joining it with {{the headwaters of the}} Harlem River, which flowed in an [...] "S"-shaped course southwest and then north into the East River. Steep cliffs along the Spuyten Duyvil's mouth at the Hudson prevented any bridge there, but upstream it narrowed into a rocky drainage. Prior {{to the development of the}} Bronx, the creek was fed by Tibbetts Brook, which begins in Yonkers, Westchester County and intersected with the creek at modern West 230th Street. The brook currently ends above ground within Van Cortlandt Park, emptying into the Harlem River system at the Wards Island Water Pollution Control Plant via underground sewers.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to ‘The Swelkie’, races form {{at both the}} north and south ends of Stroma and Swona.

Large swell waves can also be present, especially in bad weather conditions. When entering or leaving the eddies, crossing the races, even large powerful vessels can be pushed off course, such is the demarcation between the relatively calm eddy and the fast-moving <b>tide</b> in the <b>races.</b> There are other races in the firth particularly off Brough Head.|$|R

Its distinguishing feature is the loop around the Black Rocks, over a mile from the shore, and largely under water except at low <b>tide.</b> The <b>race</b> is held on a suitable Friday in May or June, when the tide is out and the water is no more than knee deep. Over the years it has changed from a simple race into a full-blown social night in Kinghorn's calendar.|$|R

[...] Cambridge's coaches worked to re-introduce a more traditional style of rowing but like Oxford, [...] "their material was not very good". [...] Although they lost Eric Fairbairn late in the build-up to the race, Drinkwater considered them to be [...] "a pretty, lively crew to look at".

All moving scenes were done {{on the back of a}} flatbed truck under the supervision of <b>TIDE</b> Ferrari <b>Racing</b> crew member / model Kimberly Denson of Ft. Lauderdale, Fl. It can be clearly identified as a real Daytona (American version) by the door handles, side markers, windshield rake, sun visors, width variation and side vent windows.|$|R
50|$|The ‘Duncansby Race’ forms off Ness of Duncansby at {{the start}} of the SE-going tidal stream (flood). Initially {{extending}} ENE but wheeling gradually anti-clockwise until it extends about 1.5 km NW some 2½ hrs later at which point it is known as ‘The Boars of Duncansby’. During the time of the SE stream there is additional turbulence off Duncansby Head, particularly to the East. The race temporarily ceases at the turn of the tide before forming in an ENE direction in the NW-going tidal stream (ebb) before ceasing again at the next turn of the <b>tide.</b> The <b>race</b> is particularly violent and dangerous when the tidal stream is opposed by gales in the opposite direction. During the east-going stream a race forms off Ness of Huna. This race can be particularly violent in an easterly or southeasterly gale.|$|R

40|$|In this article, Jens Arnbak {{argues that}} the <b>racing</b> <b>tide</b> of {{development}} of information technology, and of telecommunications networks and services in particular, is not matched by its social and user acceptance and application. Two case studies are cited, both {{in the field of}} telecommunications: Nordic mobile telephony networks, and a comparison between facsimile transmission based on paper and electronic mail in inter-office communication. Both illustrate that, despite clear technical and even cost advantages, social resistance is preventing the speedy adoption of high-tech telecommunications networks across national borders. The author's prescription-innovation in novel telecommunications must take careful account of social and cultural adaptation rates in national and international institutions and markets. ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the evening}} of the day on which they saw the last of Vancouver Island, Jimmy sat in the Cetacea’s cockpit with a chart of the North Pacific spread out before him on the cabin hatch. It showed the tortuous straits, thickly {{sprinkled}} with islands of all sizes, through which they had somehow threaded their way during the last week, in spite of baffling head winds and <b>racing</b> <b>tides,</b> and though Jimmy was a navigator he felt some surprise at their having accomplished the feat without touching bottom. Now he had their course to the north plotted out along the deeply fretted coast of British Columbia, and rolling up the chart he rose to look about.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 1825 anyone {{wanting to}} go from Hayle to St Ives or Penzance had to cross the sands of Hayle Estuary or make a {{significant}} detour crossing the River Hayle at the ancient St Erth Bridge. Guides took travellers across the sands, but, even with guides, it was sometimes a perilous journey and the shifting sand and <b>racing</b> <b>tide</b> claimed several lives. Because of this major obstacle to trade, a turnpike trust was formed, with Henry Harvey a trustee, to build the causeway which now takes the road below the plantation west to the Old Quay House. Costing £5000 in 1825, the investors charged a toll to use the causeway to recover their costs.|$|R
6000|$|This was so apparent, {{there was}} no disputing it.

That we passed it with great velocity, too, was a circumstance that our eyes showed us too plainly to admit of any mistake.

60|$|Jealousy and pain, {{following}} his frenzy, abided with him long hours, {{and when they}} passed he divined that selfishness passed with them. What he suffered then was for Fay Larkin and for her sisters in misfortune. He grew big enough to pity these fanatics. The fiery, <b>racing</b> <b>tide</b> of blood that had made of him only an animal had cooled with thought of others. Still he feared that stultifying thing which must have been hate. What a tempest had raged within him! This blood of his, that had received a stronger strain from his desert life, might in a single moment flood out reason and intellect and make him a vengeful man. So in those starlit hours that dragged interminably he looked deep into his heart and tried to fortify himself against a dark and evil moment to come.|$|R
5000|$|The old {{coaching}} road once led {{through the}} village, before {{the building of}} the Causeway in 1825 {{along the edge of the}} Hayle Estuary. Prior to 1825 anyone wanting to go from Hayle to St Ives or Penzance had to cross the sands of Hayle Estuary or make a significant detour crossing the River Hayle at the ancient St Erth Bridge. The Star Inn, in St Erth village centre, is a fine coaching inn dating from the fourteenth/fifteenth centuries. It was along this route that tin was carried upcountry from the stannaries of Penwith. Guides took travellers across the sands, but, even with guides, it was sometimes a perilous journey and the shifting sand and <b>racing</b> <b>tide</b> claimed several lives.

5000|$|The 2009 {{calendar}} {{is highlighted}} with a race added to Saskatchewan at the Auto Clearing Motor Speedway, {{a return to}} Delaware Speedway and the dates at Cayuga, Ontario removed. Important car changes are Joey Hanssen came from the Netherlands to run a second D. J. Kennington's car, J. R. Fitzpatrick has graduated to NASCAR Camping World Truck Series and will only run part-time and as well as American NASCAR star Cale Gale will run a couple of races. Again all of the races will air on TSN on tape delay. The 2009 season will be David Whitlock's last season as he started it off great with a win in Quebec. Formula One driver Jacques Villeneuve made his series debut in the <b>Tide</b> 250 (4th <b>race</b> of the year) finishing last after wrecking out on the 1st lap where Scott Steckly went to victory lane. During the western road swing of races Andrew Ranger won {{two of the three}} taking the points lead with Steckly picking up the 3rd and the first ever race in Saskatchewan. Ranger then {{went on to win the}} next two races. Montreal is the most famed race, as it is paired with the NASCAR Nationwide Series. An eventful last lap ended with Scott Steckly on his roof and [...] R. Fitzpatrick picking up his first win of the season. At the end of the season Don Thompson Jr. finally won after a disappointing first half of the year at Barrie Speedway. Andrew Ranger ended up getting his 6th win of 13 and locking up the championship with a win at Riverside Speedway on September 20, 2009. The final weekend of racing took place at Kawartha Speedway where D. J. Kennington picked up his second win of the season. The race was delayed many times and was run on Sunday instead of Saturday due to rain. Andrew Ranger won his second championship in three years with the biggest points margin in series history. He will be eligible for the Toyota All-Star Shootout in January, looking to expand his NASCAR career to the next level. The 2009 Rookie of the year was Joey Hanssen, who beat out Dexter Stacey.|$|R
