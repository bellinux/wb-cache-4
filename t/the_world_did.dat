500|$|The taxonomic {{history of}} Paraceratherium is complex {{due to the}} fragmentary nature of the known fossils and because western, Soviet, and Chinese {{scientists}} worked in isolation from each other {{for much of the}} 20th century and published research mainly in their respective languages. Scientists from different parts of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>did</b> attempt to compare their finds to get a more complete picture of these animals, but were hindered by politics and wars. The opposing taxonomic tendencies of [...] "lumping and splitting" [...] have also contributed to the problem. Inaccurate geological dating previously led scientists to believe various geological formations that are now known to be contemporaneous were of different ages. Many genera were named on the basis of subtle differences in molar characteristicsfeatures that vary within populations of other rhinoceros taxaand are therefore not accepted by most scientists for distinguishing species.|$|E
500|$|Although Sam & Max Save <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>did</b> {{not receive}} the {{critical}} acclaim that Sam & Max Hit the Road acquired, it still received a favorable response from critics across its release in 2006 and 2007.

Save the World is considered by journalists in the video game industry to be the first successful application of episodic gaming, as Telltale Games had managed to release a steady stream content with only small time gaps. Previous attempts by Valve Software with the Half-Life series, Ritual Entertainment with SiN Episodes and Telltale Games themselves with [...] were {{for a variety of reasons}} not considered successful implementations of the distribution model. Beyond Time and Space was considered similar to Save the World and reviewers equally praised and faulted the game on this, although overall Beyond Time and Space received a good reception from critics.|$|E

Further, if Tibetan nobles murdered any of them, which is quite possible, it would {{more likely to have been}} in order to protect or enhance their personal family interests rather than out of suspicion that the Dalai Lamas were seen as Chinese-appointed imposters as suggested by Norbu.
