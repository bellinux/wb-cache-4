5|$|From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a {{great deal}} of his time and fortune on a series of {{projects}} trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of his idea of using coils <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> power he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He could see this as not only a way <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> worldwide communications.|$|E

5000|$|In chemistry, {{absorbance}} or decadic absorbance is {{the common}} logarithm of the ratio of incident <b>to</b> <b>transmitted</b> radiant power through a material, and spectral absorbance or spectral decadic absorbance {{is the common}} logarithm of the ratio of incident <b>to</b> <b>transmitted</b> spectral radiant power through a material. Absorbance is dimensionless, and in particular is not a length, {{though it is a}} monotonically increasing function of path length, and approaches zero as the path length approaches zero. The use of the term [...] "optical density" [...] for absorbance is discouraged.In physics, a closely related quantity called [...] "optical depth" [...] is used instead of absorbance: the natural logarithm of the ratio of incident <b>to</b> <b>transmitted</b> radiant power through a material. The optical depth equals the absorbance times ln(10).|$|R
5|$|In 1963 Hydro-Québec {{purchased}} {{the shares of}} nearly all remaining privately owned electrical utilities then operating in Québec and undertook construction of the Manicouagan-Outardes hydroelectric complex. <b>To</b> <b>transmit</b> the complex's annual production of about 30 billion kWh over a distance of nearly 700km, Hydro-Québec had to innovate. Led by Jean-Jacques Archambault, it became the first utility in the world <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> electricity at 735 kV, rather than 300–400kV which was the world standard at that time. In 1962, Hydro-Québec proceeded {{with the construction of}} the first 735kV power line in the world. The line, stretching from the Manic-Outardes dam to the Levis substation, was brought into service on 29 November 1965.|$|E

5|$|The {{datalink}} for Malaysia Airline's avionics {{communications at}} the time of the incident was supplied by SITA, which contracted with Inmarsat to provide a satellite communication link using Inmarsat's Classic Aero service. Aeronautical satellite communication (SATCOM) systems are used <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> messages from the aircraft cockpit as well as automated messages from on-board systems using the ACARS communications protocol, but may also be used <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> FANS and ATN messages and provide voice, fax, and data links using other protocols. An appropriate comparison of ACARS' relationship to the SATCOM system is that of a messaging application to a smartphone; the smartphone functions and will remain registered on a mobile phone network even if the messaging application is closed.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{commonly}} hypothesized that Pachycephalosaurus and its relatives were the bipedal equivalents of bighorn sheep or musk oxen, where male individuals would ram each other headlong, {{and that they}} would horizontally straighten their head, neck, and body in order <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> stress during ramming. However, there have also been alternative suggestions that the pachycephalosaurs could not have used their domes in this way.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of generations, the cheela come to worship the humans' {{spacecraft}} as a god, and their records of its satellites' movements cause them to develop writing. Several generations later, the cheela build an arena to accommodate thousands of worshippers. The humans notice this novel and very regular feature, conclude that intelligent beings inhabit the star, and use a laser to send simple messages. Cheela astronomers gradually realize that these are diagrams of the spaceships, its satellites and its crew – impossibly spindly creatures, who communicate with frustrating slowness, and are apparently almost 10% {{as long as the}} cheela's great arena. A cheela engineer proposes to send messages to the humans. As her attempts <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> from the civilization's territory are ineffective, she travels to a mountain range <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> directly under the spacecraft – conquering the fear of heights that is instinctive for flattened creatures living in 67billion g. The humans recognize her message and realize that the cheela live a million times faster than humans.|$|E
