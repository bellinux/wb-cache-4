DVB-H also makes coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, time slicing, and multi-protocol encapsulation-forward error correction (MPE-FEC) compatible with the existing broadcasting standard. We describe a DVB-H Internet Protocol (IP) decapsulator that can achieve time slicing and MPE, as well as cross platform compatibility, and is highly adaptable. Power consumption is always an issue in handheld devices, and time slicing effectively reduces the most serious DVB-H demodulator power consumption problems. The DVB-H protocol uses MPE to deliver information, and unlike other DVB protocols, the video and sound data of DVB-H are not packed directly into the MPEG- 2 transport stream. Instead, they are packed into the IP datagram, MPE is performed, and then the data are delivered via the MPEG- 2 transport stream. In this way, DVB-H is backward-compatible with DVB-T. We implemented the DVB-H IP decapsulator using pure Java language, which enables it to function across platforms. We specified a platform-adaptive layer to reduce the drive complexity between the Java virtual machine and the demodulator. Because DVB-H has a built-in IP decapsulator <b>transport</b> stream <b>dispatcher</b> module, it independently creates program-specific information and service information subdecoders. Therefore, the packet that recognizes the decoders can be obtained from the <b>transport</b> stream <b>dispatcher</b> while the registration of that specific packet is completed...|$|R
50|$|All 9-1-1 {{calls are}} {{received}} at the Tallahassee Consolidated Dispatch Agency which operates {{as the center}} for all EMS systems using the Computerized Medical Priority Dispatch Protocol. That call is triaged for appropriate response and is handled by the EMS Controller, who dispatches the appropriate means of <b>transport</b> determined. EMS <b>dispatchers</b> also keep ambulances informed as they drive to the scene.|$|R
40|$|Many Emergency Medical Service (EMS) systems {{worldwide}} handle emergency rescues {{as well as}} patient <b>transports</b> and <b>dispatchers</b> need {{to assign}} ambulances to incidents manually throughout the day. The management of the complex system together with the manual assignments can easily create stress for and pressure on the dispatchers. Mathematical algorithms can help improving the dispatching quality, but then dispatchers still need to choose the best-fitting algorithm and furthermore, trust the algorithm’s dispatching suggestion. We propose an assistant that can support the EMS dispatchers. The assistant offers explanations for {{the choice of the}} algorithm as well as the dispatching suggestion in order to increase the dispatchers’ trust and decrease their stress. We ground the assistant’s design in Information Systems as well as Operations Research literature and thus, show how interdisciplinary service research can contribute in designing artefacts for complex service systems to solve real-world problems...|$|R
30|$|There are {{few or no}} {{economies of}} scale in {{operating}} a taxi vehicle, but significant economies of scale in dispatching (see 2.1). As most tendered transport is dependent on a dispatcher functioning as an intermediary between client and driver, there are scale benefits. How large {{will depend on the}} form of contract and on the distribution of responsibility between the authority ordering the <b>transport</b> and the <b>dispatcher.</b> This relation has changed during the process of competitive tendering in the direction of more responsibility with the public authority reducing the economies of scale [1]. However, as there are still significant economies of scale in the pre-booked market segment, which is economically important for taxi owners, each owner will prefer {{to be associated with the}} largest dispatcher in the area, as this will provide the expected return. A new dispatcher entering the market is therefore faced not only with the normal start-up cost, but also with the licence owners’ disincentive to choose the new entrant.|$|R
