5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>period</b> (516 BCE to 70 CE), Hellenistic and Roman culture heavily {{influenced}} cuisine, particularly {{of the priests}} and aristocracy of Jerusalem. Elaborate meals were served that included piquant entrées and alcoholic drinks, fish, beef, meat, pickled and fresh vegetables, olives, and tart or sweet fruits.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, it was {{reported}} that Robert Hamilton, an archaeologist who worked on the Temple Mount after the 1927 Jericho earthquake, had discovered remains under al-Aqsa mosque that he did not publish in his book on the excavations. These included a mosaic like those used in Byzantine churches, and a Jewish mikveh from <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
5|$|Robinson's Arch was {{constructed}} {{as part of}} King Herod's renovation and expansion of the Second Temple, announced in 20–19BCE.

5|$|Biblical Hebrew after <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>period</b> {{evolved into}} Mishnaic Hebrew, which ceased being spoken and {{developed}} into a literary language around 200 CE. Hebrew continued {{to be used as}} a literary and liturgical language in the form of Medieval Hebrew, and Hebrew began a revival process in the 19th century, culminating in Modern Hebrew becoming the official language of Israel. Currently, Classical Hebrew is generally taught in public schools in Israel, and Biblical Hebrew forms are sometimes used in Modern Hebrew literature, much as archaic and biblical constructions are used in Modern English literature. Since Modern Hebrew contains many biblical elements, Biblical Hebrew is fairly intelligible to Modern Hebrew speakers.|$|E
5|$|The Western Wall is {{considered}} holy {{due to its}} connection to the Temple Mount. Because of the Temple Mount entry restrictions, the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, {{though it is not}} the holiest site in the Jewish faith, which lies behind it. The original, natural and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger Temple compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by Herod, who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls, built to support extensive substructures and earth fills needed to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved esplanade which surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one {{is considered}} to be closest to the former Temple, which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount esplanade. Just over half the wall's total height, including its 17 courses located below street level, dates from the end of <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>period,</b> and is commonly believed to have been built around 19 BCE by Herod the Great, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the Umayyad era, while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.|$|E

50|$|The term Galilean dialect {{generally}} {{refers to}} the form of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic spoken by people in Galilee during <b>the</b> late <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>period,</b> for example {{at the time of}} Jesus and the disciples, as distinct from a Judean dialect spoken in Jerusalem.|$|R

25|$|Historians {{have argued}} over whether Karaism {{has a direct}} {{connection}} to anti-Rabbinic sects and views, {{such as those of}} the Sadducees, dating back to the end of <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>period</b> (70CE), or whether Karaism represents a novel emergence of similar views. Karaites have always maintained that, while there are some similarities to the Sadducees, due to the rejection of Rabbinical authority and the Oral Law, there are major differences. The ancestors of the Karaites were a group called Benei Ṣedeq during <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E

25|$|However, barley {{declined}} as {{the staple}} from the biblical period, to a poverty food {{by the end}} of <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>period,</b> and by the Talmudic era it was regarded mostly as animal fodder.|$|E

25|$|The {{language}} of the prayers, while clearly being from <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>period,</b> often employs Biblical idiom, and according to some authorities it should not contain rabbinic or Mishnaic idiom apart from in the sections of Mishnah that are featured (see Baer).|$|E

25|$|Post-Biblical Hebrew {{writings}} include rabbinic {{works of}} Midrash, Mishnah, and Talmud. In addition, there are non-rabbinic Hebrew texts from <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> and subsequent <b>periods.</b>|$|R
50|$|During <b>the</b> late <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>period,</b> Halhul (Greek: Alurus) and its {{immediate}} environs were considered {{a part of}} Idumea, presumably because of its Idumean inhabitants who converted to Judaism under John Hyrcanus. During the Jewish war with Rome, the village became a trysting place for the different Jewish factions. During the Bar Kokhba revolt the town's defenses were fortified.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> Judaean <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>period,</b> Rabbi Simeon ben Shetach in the 1st century BC is {{reported}} to have sentenced to death eighty women who had been charged with witchcraft on a single day in Ashkelon.

25|$|Judaism, {{at least}} in <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>Period</b> at Qumran, {{traditionally}} held {{that there would be}} a resurrection of just and unjust, but of the very good and very bad, and of Jews only.
