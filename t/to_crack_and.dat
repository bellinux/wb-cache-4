5|$|Renewed {{tension between}} Britain and France in the 1840s {{led to a}} {{modernisation}} of some of Britain's coastal defences. The batteries at Shornemead and Coalhouse Point were reinstated and upgraded, though the one at Lower Hope Point was never restored. In {{the case of the}} Coalhouse battery, it was substantially expanded between 1847 and 1855 to convert it into a fort. The work was slow as the marshy ground caused the foundations <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> the structure to subside, and the contractor was unsatisfactory.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{was also}} {{susceptible}} to intense heat, which would cause it <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> collapse. Byzantine sources recorded {{the demolition of}} stone structures caused by placing clay pots of burning charcoal {{at the base of}} walls moistened with vinegar or urine, and the 6th century treatise by an engineer in Justinian's army includes the lighting fires beneath the walls amongst its instructions for sieges.|$|E
5|$|Clarinet {{bodies have}} been made {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including wood, plastic, hard rubber, metal, resin, and ivory. The vast majority of clarinets used by professionals are made from African hardwood, mpingo (African Blackwood) or grenadilla, rarely (because of diminishing supplies) Honduran rosewood and sometimes even cocobolo. Historically other woods, notably boxwood, were used. Most inexpensive clarinets are made of plastic resin, such as ABS. Resonite is Selmer's trademark name for its type of plastic. Metal soprano clarinets were popular in the early 20th century until plastic instruments supplanted them; metal construction is still used for the bodies of some contra-alto and contrabass clarinets and the necks and bells of nearly all alto and larger clarinets. Ivory was used for a few 18th-century clarinets, but it tends <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> does not keep its shape well. Buffet Crampon's Greenline clarinets are made from a composite of grenadilla wood powder and carbon fiber. Such clarinets are less affected by humidity and temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier. Hard rubber, such as ebonite, has been used for clarinets since the 1860s, although few modern clarinets are made of it. Clarinet designers Alastair Hanson and Tom Ridenour are strong advocates of hard rubber. Hanson Clarinets of England manufactures clarinets using a grenadilla compound reinforced with ebonite, known as 'BTR' (bithermal reinforced) grenadilla. This material is also not affected by humidity, and the weight is {{the same as that of}} a wooden clarinet.|$|E

50|$|Taxidermy {{specimens}} {{are especially}} susceptible to fluctuations in humidity {{due to their}} composite materials. Relative humidity fluctuations below 40% can cause greater damage than fluctuations above 40%. Dry environments with low humidity may cause de-lamination or cracking in horns, bones, and turtle shells. Additionally, dry environments can cause skins and leathers to contract and shrink over the support form, which eventually leads <b>to</b> <b>cracking</b> <b>and</b> splitting. High humidity and moist environments can promote mold growth and attract pests. Bones will contract and swell due to humidity fluctuations, which may lead <b>to</b> <b>cracking</b> <b>and</b> splitting. This may lead to further structural damage if the bones are used as support within the specimen.|$|R

25|$|The {{actions of}} Hamilcar, and his {{immunity}} to defeat, plus the stalemate at {{the siege of}} Lilybaeum caused the Romans to start building a fleet in 243 BC to seek a decision at sea. However, the constant skirmishing without ultimate victory may have caused the morale of some of Hamilcar’s troops <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> 1,000 Celtic mercenaries tried to betray the Punic camp to the Romans, which was foiled. Hamilcar had to promise considerable rewards to keep the morale of his army up, which was to produce near fatal problems for Carthage later on.|$|E
25|$|De la Union's {{attempt to}} relieve Bellegarde failed at the Battle of San-Lorenzo de la Muga on 13 August. The French {{sustained}} 800 casualties including General of Brigade Guillaume Mirabel killed. Augereau led 9,000 {{men on the}} right, Pérignon had 16,000 troops in the center while Sauret commanded 9,000 on the left. The Spanish attacked with 45,000 troops including 4,000 cavalry. De la Union tried to overwhelm Augereau with 22,000 men but made the same mistake as in the May attack by attacking in six columns. This time the struggle lasted 16 hours in which Augereau was nearly driven from the field but held it at the end. The French took only 140 prisoners and killed 1,336 of their enemies. Sauret had repelled an attack on his wing while Victor's brigade had repulsed a seaborne assault on the coast. At last, Dugommier ordered Augereau to abandon the cannon foundry and move toward the center. Bellegarde {{proved to be a}} tough nut <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> its 1,000 surviving defenders only capitulated on 17 September. The French won a decisive victory at the Battle of the Black Mountain fought from 17 to 20 November. Uniquely, both army commanders Dugommier and de la Union were killed in action. The French had 36,700 troops to oppose 46,000 entrenched Spanish. Augereau began the attack at dawn on the 17th and began rolling up the Spanish left. After Dugommier was killed by a Spanish shell that morning, Pérignon took command of the army and called off the attack for two days. General of Division Jean Baptiste Beaufort de Thorigny took command of the center. On the 20th, Augereau's assault recommenced and captured the key Roure redoubt. De la Union led his cavalry in a countercharge and was later found dead with two bullet wounds. Taking few prisoners, the French massacred 8,000 of their foes as they overran all the defensive works on the left and center. The undefeated Spanish right wing under Lieutenant General Juan Miguel de Vives y Feliu was also compelled to retreat. The French lost about 3,000 killed and wounded. Pérignon quickly seized Figueres and bluffed the powerful Sant Ferran fortress into surrendering on 28 November with 9,000 Spanish prisoners and 171 guns.|$|E

500|$|Turtle Mountain stands {{immediately}} {{south of}} Frank. It {{consists of an}} older limestone layer folded over on top of softer materials such as shale and sandstone. Erosion had left the mountain with a steep overhang of its limestone layer. It has long been unstable; the Blackfoot and Kutenai peoples called it [...] "the mountain that moves" [...] and refused to camp in its vicinity. In {{the weeks leading up}} to the disaster, miners occasionally felt rumblings from within the mountain, while the pressure created by the shifting rock sometimes caused the timbers supporting the mine shafts <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> splinter.|$|E
500|$|The star {{contains}} {{about half of}} a solar mass of matter, compressed into a diameter of about , making its surface gravity 67billion times that of Earth. Its outer crust, compressed to about 7,000kg per cubic centimeter, is mainly iron nuclei with {{a high concentration of}} neutrons, overlaid with about [...] of white dwarf star material. The atmosphere, mostly iron vapor, is about [...] thick. The star shrinks slightly as it cools, causes the crust <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> produce mountains [...] high. Large volcanos, formed by liquid material oozing from deep cracks, can be many centimeters high and hundred meters in diameters, and will eventually collapse, causing starquakes.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the latter}} stages of his career, he wore special thigh- and shin-pads {{to protect himself}} from injury in the ruck—his specially-designed shin-pad was {{required}} to protect a problematic shin injury which had threatened his career. During a match in 2003, he was kicked in the shin, causing his shin-pad <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> split the skin, leaving a laceration {{about the size of}} a tablespoon. Once the wound had healed, White's surgeon told him that if it split open again, he would have to stop playing. White has said that this [...] "reality check" [...] helped to strengthen his focus and helped him deal with injuries more effectively. He said that the specially-designed shin-guard and those who designed it [...] "saved his career". (The shin-guard can be seen on White's right-leg in the photos on this page.) ...|$|E

500|$|The first {{concrete}} was {{poured into}} the dam on June 6, 1933, 18months ahead of schedule. Since concrete heats and contracts as it cures, the potential for uneven cooling and contraction of the concrete posed a serious problem. Bureau of Reclamation engineers calculated that if the dam was built in a single continuous pour, the concrete would take 125 years to cool, and the resulting stresses would cause the dam <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> crumble. Instead, the ground where the dam would rise was marked with rectangles, and concrete blocks in columns were poured, some as large as [...] and [...] high. Each five-foot form contained a series of [...] steel pipes; cool riverwater would be poured through the pipes, followed by ice-cold water from a refrigeration plant. When an individual block had cured and had stopped contracting, the pipes were filled with grout. Grout was also used to fill the hairline spaces between columns, which were grooved to increase {{the strength of the}} joins.|$|E
500|$|On {{the first}} day, Richard Hornby, of {{engineering}} consulting firm Arup, {{stated that the}} truss end in question had been inspected 23 times since 2001, and no fault had been found. It was revealed a pin had seized up, which caused the truss end <b>to</b> <b>crack,</b> <b>and</b> was only {{the quality of the}} steel which had stopped its cracking appearing earlier. Hornby also made clear that even if the seized pin had been picked up earlier, it was [...] "virtually impossible" [...] to lubricate the bearing. Several witnesses defended a decision by previous operator Forth Estuary Transport Authority (Feta) not to proceed with a £15 million truss end link replacement project in 2010. This claim was disputed by Barry Colford, former chief engineer and bridgemaster at the Feta. Lesley Hinds, Feta’s former convener, pointed out that the bridge budget had been cut by 58% in 2011, while senior staff at Feta had [...] "deep concerns" [...] about the transfer of bridge management to a private company.|$|E
