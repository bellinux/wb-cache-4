Since symbolic meaning of numbers have connotative meaning and they are absolutely different from its initial meaning, we tried to find out what were the main reasons for establishment of those symbols. As symbols have <b>transferred</b> <b>meaning</b> it was considered several factors which could influence on appearance of those symbolic meanings. This article surveyed factors as religion and mythology, considering them as initial steps of national consciousness creation. Hence it was given the evolutional history of religion and mythology peculiar to Turkic cultures.

These intentions are brought into connection with Paul's usage of worship terminology. Further, the significance of the Corinthian gathering {{for the life of the}} church is discussed. The analysis of the problem of the Corinthian Eucharist shows that different groups begin the dinner breaking the loaf at different moments as they arrive. Paul denies that this dinner is the Eucharist and re-establishes it by quoting the paradosis that emphasizes Jesus' dominance over the Eucharist and community with those for whom Jesus died. Concerning the Corinthian gathering where charismas appear Paul presents the profession of Jesus as Lord as a criterion of true spirituality. The general criterion for reformation of the worship is oikodome as the benefit for the church that is Christ's body. Paul emphasizes the integrative character of worship. However, Christian worship exceeds all sacral forms and fills the whole life of a believer. That's why Paul likes using sacral terminology in a <b>transferred</b> <b>meaning.</b> The Corinthian gathering for the Eucharist is very important for the church suffering from schism.

Taj je frazemski sloj odabran jer su somatizmi vrlo bogat frazemski sloj u većini jezika. U radu se na temelju odabranih primjera iz prikupljene građe analiziraju podudarnosti i razlike hrvatskih i talijanskih frazema s obzirom na njihov leksemski sastav i značenje. Također se tumači pozadinska slika koja je motivirala značenje pojedinih frazema, kao i utjecaj osnovnih prototipnih i prenesenih (rubnih) značenja pojedinih leksema na značenje cijeloga frazema. Propituje se i semantički odnos holonimije i meronimije, tj. (ne) zamjenjivost holonima i meronima unutar istoga frazema. This paper gives a {{comparative}} analysis of one level of phrasemes in Croatian and Italian language – that whose components {{are parts of}} body hand and its parts. The level was chosen because the parts of body are probably the richest phraseological level in most languages. The aim {{of this paper was}} to determine in what amount has the possible basic and <b>transferred</b> <b>meaning</b> of the word hand and its parts (fist, finger, palm, nail, elbow and shoulder) influenced the meaning of the whole phraseme on one hand and the symbolism of an individual phraseme on another. Thus, lexical meaning of each part of body was determined to show if they are realized in the phrasemes surrounding. The semantic phenomena of meronymy and holonymy on the examples of phrasemes are also discussed, (i. e. (im) possibility of their substitution in certain phrasemes). The conducted analysis proved that basic and <b>transferred</b> <b>meaning</b> of the word hand and its parts are generated in a large number of phrasemes (i. e. they influenced the background image and the meaning of a certain phraseme). The large correspondence in lexical meaning in both languages and phrasemes are registered, which is, of course, a consequence {{of the fact that the}} role of hand and other body parts represents a kind of universality. Therefore, the correspondence could also be expected in other European languages. However, the structural and semantic differences between Croatian and Italian phrasemes are also registered which is, as always when it comes to the phraseology, the result of national and cultural particularities. That particularly applies to the phrasemes of gestural origin because it does not mean that all gestures in all cultures have the same meaning, and some are not even used. There was a great possibility of replacement of holonyms by meronyms which then make synonymous pair, such as holonym hand by meronym fist, palm or fingers [...] . This happens because of the wide range of meanings of the word hand, unlike his meronyms. Therefore, the replacement of some meronym by holonym hand has not been confirmed. Because of the possibility of replacement of the word hand by its parts, a great number of lexical variants have been confirmed in the Croatian phrasemes...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{principles}} of the semantic organisation of Marulić’s parables and the interpretative models associated with them. This is done firstly through a short look at Marulić’s and general terminological and conceptual definitions of the parable, then through a summary examination of the thematic and macro-composition plan of the parables in the collection, as well as their functional orientation. The further course of the research is directed towards the problematisation of the relations between the literal and the figurative meanings in the parables, which enables us to systematise Marulić’s parables into several relatively homogenous groups. Finally, attention is drawn to the rhetorical and argumentative orientation of these parables, which is set in advance by the parable narrative tradition and confirmed by Marulić’s specific requirement for direct action upon the recipient. The rhetorical and argumentative orientation of Marulić’s parables is confirmed by the choice of the most common low mimetic manner of narrating, which creates the fundamental precondition for imitability, and is causally linked with the generally accepted low character of the parable genre, as well as its horizontal orientation to all sectors of the folk. This does not mean, however, that Marulić meant his parables only for the simple, as he says specifically in his dedication, but, on the contrary, he had in mind recipients who were well versed {{in the tradition of the}} allegorical interpretation of the Bible. The dichotomy of principle - whether Marulić’s parables have a structure of the comparison or the allegory according to Jülicher’s postulates about Jesus’s parables in the Gospels has proved inadequate. At the second level of analysis arises the question of whether in the process of interpretation, explicitly and step by step, he carries out a literal allegorisation and sets up allegorical equations for all the units in question, sets up allegorical equivalences only for the crucial semantic units leaving the others implicitly involved in the discursively linked judgements, or leaves them out completely, sticking only to the central item of the likeness. Marulić’s parables essential have a duality of representation: of the literal and of the figurative. They are divided only in the interpretative proceeding. To discern the laws obtaining between Marulić’s interpretational models and the semantic organisation of the individual parables they are applied to is possible only with a comparison of the relations between the literal and the <b>transferred</b> <b>meaning</b> in the parable with their actualisation in the actual procedure of interpretation. Whether the spiritual (the tropological — moral) meaning is given simultaneously with the literal (the ethical teaching is gathered directly on the surface, i. e. on the literal level of meaning, from the procedure or personal features of the persons that carry out the action), or whether the spiritual meaning is revealed only in the process of interpretation when the literal significance is replaced completely by the spiritual, the parable and its interpretation are primarily imagined as a single unit. From this aspect Marulić’s interpretation cannot be explained as a supplement (Jülicher). His parables demand in advance an interpretation that is shaped as an auto-hermeneutic commentary and can be carried out by various interpretative strategies (one point of comparison, key points of comparison or separate details). What contributes to the aesthetic and rhetorical excellence of Marulić’s parables is the fact that in all the parables and in the interpretation of them a single unique law is confirmed: individual semantic units are primarily related to each other, and only secondary direct attention somewhere outside the jointly superposed subject — the point of the parable, the causally derived conclusion on the basis of the premises that are produced by the actual telling. Separate allegorical equations lead to the creation of a relative independence for individual semantic units and expansions at the cognitive and argumentative level, but never call into question the logical and narrative coherence of the parable itself or the literal level of meaning into which the spiritual meaning is included...|$|E

In a short, yet fecund essay “Signature Event Context,” Derrida tackles the problem of communication and the supposed claim of the classical notion of writing’s conception of virtual permanence within the text. The classical notion of writing claims that writing as a medium or a species of communication implies that the transference of meaning is conducted in a homogenous fashion.

At the end {{of their}} {{training}} in 2009, students, who were doing a programme in school counselling at a university in Gauteng, submitted professional portfolios to illustrate their learning. This research inquiry focused on the metaphors developed in these portfolios in order to obtain insights into the personal and professional development of school counsellors-in-training. Meeting the portfolio requirements meant that students had to call on their in-depth self-knowledge and reflective skills. The school counsellors-in-training used metaphors in verbal or visual art representations as a reflective tool in these portfolios. These metaphors were used to <b>transfer</b> <b>meaning</b> from one object to another {{on the basis of a}} perceived similarity (Fritz in Dunbar-Krige & Fritz, 2006). The value of metaphors is that they enrich the <b>transfer</b> of <b>meaning</b> which takes place (Smith, 2002).

Therefore, the importance of this research lies in what it reveals about the development of a professional identity as a counsellor during the training process (Du Preez & Roos, 2008). Learning, in a school counselling context, refers to the personal and professional development of the student counsellors-in-training. This development was revealed in their exploration of their own selves, reflection, their supervision, their narratives and the use of metaphors to describe their journey within the programme. This personal and professional development was both a conscious and an unconscious part of the learning process.
