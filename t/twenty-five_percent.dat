However, the development of the river has threatened the continuing existence of a number of different species. Across the country, thirty to fifty (or higher) percent of endangered species are from freshwater river systems and the impact on the Shinano river system is also clear. Primarily this affects fish and amphibians due to their reliance on the river. The construction of weirs and dams to support agriculture and industry as well as the introduction of invasive species and pollution have been the main causes of ecosystem degradation.

5|$|Despite the {{maternal}} care they receive, hatchlings commonly fall to predation. While the female is transporting some {{to the nursery}} area, others are picked off by predators that lurk near the nest. The hatchlings {{are a source of}} food for most of the creatures that feed on eggs, and are also subject to aquatic attacks by turtles, fish, and snakes. Birds of prey take their toll, and in any clutch there may be malformed individuals that are unlikely to survive. In northern Australia, the survival rate for saltwater crocodile hatchlings is only <b>twenty-five</b> <b>percent,</b> but with each succeeding year of life this improves, reaching sixty percent by year five. Mortality rates are fairly low among subadults and adults, though they are occasionally preyed on by large cats and snakes. The jaguar and the giant otter may prey on caimans in South America. In other parts of the world, elephants and hippopotamuses may kill crocodiles defensively. Authorities differ as to whether much cannibalism takes place among crocodilians. Adults do not normally eat their own offspring, but there is some evidence of subadults feeding on juveniles and of adults attacking subadults. In Nile crocodiles, rival males sometimes kill each other during the breeding season.|$|E

The need of certainty and safety is dominant need especially for small children. It is need to avoid jeopardy and danger and express oneself by the general human tendency to eliminate the anxiety {{and it is possible}} to meet the needs by reliable and sure interpersonal relationship. The feel of certainty and safety enables obtaining of confidence, life worth, reliability, independency, orientation in human community as well as in material value. The hospitalization of a child means significant interference with person life. In the hospital a child is separated from the family and its home environment. A child is hamper in movement, lay up and invest with foreign people in foreign environment with different daily routine. We speak about hospitalism when the conditions in hospital or in another institute, where is the child on the long- term basis hospitalize, are so unfavourable that the child is harmed in its development. From the medical point of view has a child hospitalization also positive aspect such as pernament medical supervision and professional care. The aim of my bachelor thesis is to find out whether an often hospitalized child meet the needs. I have appointed two different hypothesis: The need of certainty and safety is not fulfil in an often hospitalized child (H 1). The nurse cooperation with child dependents is minimal during the time of child hospitalization (H 2). Any of the above hypothesis where proven. Quantitative research was used for processing of practical part of my bachelor thesis called: "Often hospitalization of children and its affect on his need of safety and sureness. Controlled interview, observation and questionaire were used as technique of data collection and as a research collection I used patients of children's ward and its dependent from hospital in České Budějovice and Písek. The results shows that during a child hospitalization a child has only a low rate of anxiety from staying in hospital, its environment and medical staff. In the contrary a great number of children are sorrowful in the hospital. They miss both parents and friends, pet or their toys. During the hospitalization more than half of parents is accomodated together with their child. Average period of hospitalization of a child is in about sixty percents cases only one week, in <b>twenty-five</b> <b>percents</b> cases two to four weeks, in ten percents cases five or more than five weeks.

These weaknesses were major contributors to the UK's erroneous assessments of Iraq's 'weapons of mass destruction' prior to the 2003 invasion of that country.|$|E

40|$|The United States has a waste problem. It {{represents}} only {{five percent of}} the world population, yet it generates <b>twenty-five</b> to thirty <b>percent</b> of the world’s waste. In 2008, the United States generated 389. 5 million tons of municipal solid waste (MSW). As our economy and population continue to grow, our waste will continue to grow as well. The obvious dilemma is that all of this waste, the byproduct of our economic advances, creates significant adverse environmental and public health effects when landfilled or incinerated. This Article explores the use of extended producer responsibility (EPR) laws to achieve the ultimate waste management goal: “zero waste. ” Zero waste is achieved through the complete diversion of MSW from landfills and incinerators, resource conservation, and sustainable product redesign. Historically, MSW has been dumped in landfills or deposited in waste incinerators, practices that have allowed for robust commerce and economic growth. However, these typical waste management practices cause vast amounts of air, water, and soil pollution, increased greenhouse gas emissions, and other adverse environmental and public health issues associated with burying or burning our garbage...|$|R
25|$|The term consent is {{typically}} {{defined as a}} subject adhering to an agreement of principals and regulations; however, the definition becomes difficult to execute concerning the topic of organ donation, mainly because the subject is incapable of consent due to death or mental impairment. There {{are two types of}} consent being reviewed; explicit consent and presumed consent. Explicit consent consists of the donor giving direct consent through proper registration depending on the country. The second consent process is presumed consent, which does not need direct consent from the donor or the next of kin. Presumed consent assumes that donation would have been permitted by the potential donor if permission was pursued. Of possible donors an estimated <b>twenty-five</b> <b>percent</b> of families refuse to donate a loved one's organs. Consent is defined as adhering to an agreement of principals.

For a loop service, NSB proposed that the airport be served with existing commuter trains running on the Drammen Line between Asker Station and Lillestrøm Station (today's line L1). The main advantage {{was that it would}} allow all regional and express trains, including those serving to the Bergen Line, the Sørlandet Line and the Vestfold Line, to call at the airport. Travel times were estimated at 12 minutes to Oslo Central Station, 18 minutes to Asker, and 25 and 33 minutes, respectively by commuter and express train, to Drammen Station.
