5|$|A 2003 {{episode of}} Discovery Channel's Unsolved History used modern {{technology}} {{to attempt to}} re-enact the gunfight. They utilized a movie set to recreate a space similar to the lot where the original gun fight took place. They confirmed that the front-to-back wrist wound suffered by Billy Clanton could only have occurred if his arm {{was raised in the}} manner of one holding a pistol, and that the black powder may have obscured the shooters' view of each other. The episode concluded that the three eyewitnesses for the prosecution (Sheriff Behan, Ike Clanton, and Billy Clanton) likely offered perjured testimony. They found that Tom McLaury may have been hit by the shotgun round under his armpit as he reached over his horse for a rifle in his scabbard, as the horse <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> at the same time.|$|E

Ali did not change his mind when he pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman; he did so for the unity of Islam when the Muslims had clearly <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

500|$|On {{hearing about}} this, {{conductor}} Michael Gielen stated: [...] "When {{he said he}} knew what was happening at Sirius, I <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> in horror. I haven't listened to a note since", and called Stockhausen's statements [...] "hubris" [...] and [...] "nonsense", {{while at the same time}} defending his own belief in astrology: [...] "Why should these large celestial bodies exist if they do not stand for something? I cannot imagine that there is anything senseless in the universe. There is much we do not understand" [...]|$|E

60|$|He hesitated. She {{kept her}} eyes <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> but her manner denoted impatience.|$|E
60|$|Clennam <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> {{towards the}} window, and sat {{looking out at}} the wall.|$|E

6000|$|... "Whatever it is," [...] she said, <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "I do {{not want}} to hear it now--not a word of it. You have displeased me, Arthur, and I am going to my tent." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{manner in}} which he put the {{question}} was even more offensive than the language in which he expressed it. I marked my sense of his want of common politeness by silently <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Disgrace?" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Aye! you are right.
