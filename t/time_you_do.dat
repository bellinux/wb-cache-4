500|$|The film {{went on to}} gross $23,159,305 {{domestically}} and $8,174,612 internationally {{for a total of}} $31,333,917 worldwide. Analysts deemed it a victim of poor timing and [...] "a severe miscalculation of how to attract an audience." [...] Lorenzo di Bonaventura, president of Warner Bros. at the time, explained, [...] "People always say to me, 'Why don't you make smarter family movies?' The lesson is, Every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> you get slaughtered." ...|$|E
500|$|The Dreamcast {{version was}} heavily criticized. Ryan Davis of GameSpot stated that [...] "the {{best bet for}} all {{involved}} would be to take your chips elsewhere". Similarly, IGN editor Jeremy Dunham noted that [...] "the blandness of the game's presentation would probably disappoint {{the most basic of}} cavemen. Even the graphics are disappointing. True, those card tables can look very realistic, but what else is there to marvel at? Nothing! Without any type of exploration feature, or other characters there isn't anything to render". Allgame's Bryan Hightower criticized that [...] "there are not enough games, there are annoying wait times, and the help mode is terrible". He also complained that [...] "the dealer deals painfully slow and has to say what cards you have twice. You can already read your hand right on the screen, so you don't need the dealer to waste your time". Hightower also cited that [...] "when you win at slots, the camera always goes {{to the bottom of the}} machine to show you the payout scale" [...] which [...] "becomes frustrating after a few credits because it is so slow. The act of leaving the table or machine is even slower". He also said that the advice the game gives you is [...] "Perhaps the most irritating 'feature' of this game" [...] because [...] "Each <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> something the computer wouldn't have done, a pop-up screen will appear that adds more time to the lengthy procedure of completing a bet". Hightower commented that [...] "The above-par graphics are quickly negated by the rock-bottom enjoyment factor" [...] and that [...] "this game doesn't have any of the character the real casino has".|$|E

6000|$|... "It's high <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> go to church," [...] remarked Eleanor, contemplating, {{not without}} pride, her husband's close-cropped, pugnacious head.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is high <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> something, Jerry," [...] {{his wife}} said to him one morning after their three daughters had left the breakfast-table.|$|R
6000|$|... "The lady's $1,000 set of Russian sables {{went out}} of the house about the same <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> The {{description}} fits the ones this lady has on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why don't {{you bring}} yourselves up?" [...] {{suggested}} Jem. [...] "I'll {{tell you what}} to do. Form a Good-Conduct Club and punish yourselves every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> anything that's not right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tiens! {{you gentlemen}} meet {{here for the}} first <b>time?</b> <b>You</b> <b>do</b> right to become friends--that's the best thing. Live {{together}} in peace and mutual confidence. C'est de beaucoup le plus sage." ...|$|E
60|$|But by that <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not much}} care whether she smiles or frowns. Why could she not have smiled when her smiles would have filled you with ecstasy? Everything comes {{too late in}} this world.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I think it's quite <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>did!</b> I don't {{love your}} son. I did once, but I don't now. I {{told him so}} yesterday, once for all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But at that <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} if we would {{set out in the}} hope of aiding Silas," [...] I cried, whereupon he added in a business-like tone: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You make me tired with Sylvia," [...] she said. [...] "It's about <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{know what}} she's like. She's just the commonplace, short-tempered, disagreeable-if-she-doesn't-get-her-own-way, {{unreasonable}} woman. Only more so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! {{you begin}} too soon,' he said, in so low {{a voice that}} he seemed to be {{thinking}} it, rather than addressing her. 'But you lose no <b>time.</b> <b>You</b> <b>do</b> your errand, and you earn your fee. Now, who may be your client?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll go {{on about}} money matters {{as we have been}} going. I trust to you not to run me into {{overwhelming}} debts. And, of course, if at any <b>time,</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> want to marry--on account of children or anything--if nobody knows of this conversation we can be divorced then...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No;" [...] (Edmund {{tried hard}} to prevent his [...] "no" [...] from being too emphatic, and forced himself to go on thus) [...] "I do not suppose it is entirely your fault, {{but at the same}} <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not strike me as a person likely to make friends easily." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The very same; {{the beauty}} of the county. Everybody knows May Dacre. I knew you knew her all the <b>time.</b> <b>You</b> <b>did</b> not take me in. Why, what is the matter?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good for you, Tom!" [...] cried Sam, dancing around, forgetful {{of what he}} {{had just}} said about his brother getting into trouble. [...] "That's the <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> it. Now give him another!" ...|$|R
5000|$|It samples Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen, {{while the}} song's story makes {{reference}} to the song as the lyrics read, [...] "...from the first <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> rewind that line from [...] "Hallelujah", the original Leonard Cohen version".|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{great care}} of this ring," [...] she said: [...] "it is more {{precious}} than diamonds; every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> a bad deed it will prick your finger, but if, {{in spite of its}} pricking, you go on in your own evil way, you will lose my friendship, and I shall become your enemy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] he said, {{resuming}} a brisk official manner. [...] "I understand. Having {{missed the}} next, you propose {{to take another}} one. Excellent! What business enterprise you foreigners have! You miss your train! What do you do? Do you abandon your journey? No. Do you sit down--do you weep? No. Do you lose <b>time?</b> <b>You</b> <b>do</b> not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why? Oh! {{you know}} I am to sail next week, {{and we have}} never been here--and, now we are both of an age to {{communicate}} our thoughts to each other--I supposed--that is--there must be a beginning of all things, and it is as well to commence now, as any other <b>time.</b> <b>You</b> <b>do</b> not seem {{more than half a}} sister, in the company of strangers like the Mertons, and Hardinges!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everybody knows it," [...] he said. [...] "I {{thought you}} knew it. And since you don't know it, it's <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> and I'm glad of the chance of setting you straight. Joe Garland and you are brothers--half-brothers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who wouldn't? Thet big beast {{is enough}} to scare any one. For land's sakes, don't ever fetch him down here again! I'll never forgit the <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> All the folks an' {{children}} an' hosses in Pine broke an' run thet day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, but I did," [...] she cried. [...] "I {{never told}} her how much I wanted you to be admirable; I pretended that I despised you merely, and in reality I was {{wringing}} my hands with woe every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not behave like a god." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I knew it! Bring {{the child}} to me, and don't fret. I'll see to him, and next <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> as I say," [...] was the consoling welcome she {{received}} as the old lady popped up a sleepy but anxious face in a large flannel cap, and shook the bottle with {{the air of a}} general who had routed the foe before and meant to do it again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish there}} was {{something}} else you could call him except 'Uncle Tom'," [...] said Aunt Dahlia a little testily. [...] "Every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it, I expect to see him turn black and start playing the banjo. Yes, Uncle Tom, if you must have it. I shall have to tell him soon about losing all that money at baccarat, and, when I do, he will go up like a rocket." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All feeling {{which has}} no object to attain is morbid and maudlin," [...] said Lady Montfort. [...] "You say you are very miserable, {{and at the same}} <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not know what you want. Would you have your sister dethroned? And if you would, could you {{accomplish}} your purpose? Well, then, what nonsense to think about her except to feel proud of her elevation, and prouder still that she is equal to it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{he passed}} the hotel more slowly a man who came out called to him. [...] "Hello, Lance! Taking the trail?" [...] he said. [...] "Well, it kind of strikes me it's <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> One of Stimson's boys was down here, and he seemed quite anxious about you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>time</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean, Trackless? Let it {{come when}} it may, {{you have a}} friend in me. What <b>time</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean, my brave old Sureflint?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} matters a good deal, but perhaps we needn't go into that," [...] said Brooke, {{who took the}} cup she handed him. [...] "You have poured out tea for me on several {{occasions}} now, but still, each one recalls the first <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> it at the Quatomac ranch." ...|$|R
60|$|Pray to Him to give you, every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> wrong, that godly sorrow {{which brings}} peace and health, that heart-repentance {{never to be}} repented of. Pray to Him to {{convince}} you more and more, as you grow older, that all sin comes from not believing in Jesus Christ, not believing that He is near you, with you, in you, putting into your hearts all right thoughts and good desires, and willing, if you will, to help you to put those thoughts and desires into good practice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Phoebe," [...] said Miss Panney, [...] "you are a lazy {{woman and}} an undutiful wife. It is not four miles to Cobhurst, {{and you walk}} {{two or three times}} that {{distance}} every day, gadding about town. You ought {{to go out there and}} attend to Mike's clothes, and see that he is comfortable, instead of giving up the little <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> work to that minister, and everybody knows that the reason you have taken him to board is that you want to set yourself up above the rest of the congregation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{see that}} {{anything}} possibly could turn up," [...] James insisted; [...] "but, if at any future <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{think of any}} mad-brained attempt of escaping, you must take off your shoes, and you must put your foot down, each time, as gently as if the ground were covered with nails; for, {{if you were to}} tread upon a twig, and there were an Indian within half a mile of you, he would hear it crack. But don't you attempt any such folly. No good could possibly come of it, and you would be sure to {{fall into the hands of}} the savages or Canadians; and you know how they treat prisoners." ...|$|E
60|$|Muf. In good <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> so; I laid a trap for a bitch-fox, and a worse vermin {{has caught}} himself in it. You would fain break loose now, though you left a limb behind you; but I am yet {{in my own}} territories, and in call of company; that's my comfort.|$|R
5000|$|David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle was {{the most}} {{critical}} but commented [...] "Although it's a struggle at <b>times,</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> suspend disbelief and go with it because Lind is so adorable, {{and you want to}} accept that the saccharine story line could have played out in real life just the way it's depicted in the film." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It {{was quite}} a {{stressful}} qualifying to be honest. In Q1 we had the yellow flag from Toro Rosso I think in turn 13, so we were P15 at that moment {{and we had to}} get the lap to go through turn one. We did it at the end and then in the end in Q3 as <b>you</b> said the <b>times</b> were not working, so we were waiting in parc ferme, chatting between us drivers, asking what <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> what <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> and try to find in which position you were. Now confirmation arrived that we are on pole. A fantastic effort from the team. We put some new stuff on the car at the Nürburgring that worked very well and here we confirmed that we made a step forward. But, obviously, it is not enough. We need to keep working but finally we found the direction to go." [...] Fernando Alonso, after taking Renault's first pole position since the 2006 Chinese Grand Prix.|$|R
