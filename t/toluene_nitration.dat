40|$|A {{procedure}} is described for successfully benchmarking different inline spectroscopic techniques in a microreaction plant. The {{objective was to}} identify the highest calibration precision for the real-time quantification of the main product. Investigated methods were Raman-, near infrared-, and visible spectroscopy. Besides microreaction technology, the procedure comprises chemometric approaches using statistical experimental design tools and multivariate calibration methods. A calibration model was set up and validated within a defined parameter space (temperature, stoichiometry, and flow rate). The experimental basis was the investigation of <b>toluene</b> <b>nitration</b> using two different nitrating agents. The first reaction was a homogeneous nitration with pure nitric acid as the nitrating agent. It was found that Raman-spectroscopy generates the highest precision. In the second reaction, a heterogeneous liquid-liquid system was obtained using mixed acids. In this case, the precision is very similar for all methods with no preferences for a specific method. As well as investigating the calibration model, additional testing of the observed flow patterns was undertaken for the latter reaction, using the sensitive and very fast AOTF-NIR-spectroscopy...|$|E
40|$|Several {{worst case}} {{scenarios}} {{were carried out}} for safety evaluation of an existing nitration process. Heterogeneous nitric acid decomposition is observed {{to be the worst}} credible scenario in the <b>toluene</b> <b>nitration</b> process. Fire or explosion may subsequently develop due to temperature or pressure runaway from the undesired reaction. Gassy nitric acid decomposition can easily be triggered by process derivation from the desired reaction. In this study, a heat-flux calorimeter (C 80 –II) and an adiabatic calorimeter (VSP 2) were used to measure the thermokinetics and determine the runaway characteristics for assessing worst credible scenarios. The heat of reaction of toluene mononitration is measured to be 190. 9 ± 6 3. 6 /(kJ mol− 1). The calculated Arrhenius parameters are Ea (kJ mol− 1) = 30. 9 ± 2. 1 and A (mol− 1. 5 l 1. 5 s− 1) = (1. 38 ± 0. 07) × 10 − 2. The ‘worst case’ scenarios were chosen at the following conditions: loss of cooling, stirrer failure, batch-wise charging, and decomposition of reactants. The experimentally determined worst case was found to be a combination of a loss of cooling with batch-wise charging coupled with decomposition of nitric acid with full mixing. Adiabatic temperature rise, self-heat rate, final pressure and non-condensable gas quantity in the VSP 2 experiment were used to assess thermal explosion in a nitration reactor. Unstable and critical onset temperature to runaway is determined as about 140 °C for the process in this study...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of a free carboxyl or ester function on the alpha-carbon of <b>toluene</b> induces the <b>nitration</b> of the phenyl ring in the ortho position {{at or above the}} statistical value (chaperon effect), when pure HNO 3 is used in CH 2 Cl 2 solution. This is at variance with the results of classical nitration in H 2 SO 4, where p-nitration predominates by far and m-nitration occurs at a remarkable extent. The new finding is explained in terms of precomplex formation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Phenol is {{nitrated}} regioselectively by fuming {{nitric acid}} inside the cages of faujasite zeolites (dependent on the loading level) and a remarkable ortho-selectivity is observed in solid state <b>nitration.</b> <b>Toluene</b> and chlorobenzene also containing ortho-/para-orienting substituents, undergo faster nitration, though the regioselectivity is less significant in zeolite media. The results are explained {{on the basis of}} diffusion and binding of phenol inside zeolite, which facilitate regioselectivity (and which is absent in toluene and chlorobenzene). Other advantages of employing zeolites as media for mild and selective nitration are also highlighted...|$|R
