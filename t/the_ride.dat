5|$|Over {{the course}} of the {{construction}} of Test Track, numerous problems occurred causing delays in <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> opening. One problem that Imagineers had to overcome was that the wheels used on <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> vehicles could not stand up to the demand of <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> course and speed. This problem was resolved but a second, more severe problem caused <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> to be delayed by over a year. In order for Test Track to run with the highest hourly capacity possible, twenty-nine ride vehicles would be needed. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> programming system could only handle operating a maximum of six cars over the layout of <b>the</b> <b>ride.</b> One by one, programmers were able to get the computer system able to run twenty-nine ride vehicles all at once. After these problems were resolved, Test Track soft-opened to the public on December 19, 1998. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> was still prone to breakdowns and didn't officially open until March 17, 1997.|$|E
