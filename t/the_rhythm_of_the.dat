5|$|For adults, {{the testing}} of electrolyte, blood glucose and calcium levels is {{important}} to rule out problems with these as causes. An electrocardiogram can rule out problems with <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart. A lumbar puncture {{may be useful to}} diagnose a central nervous system infection but is not routinely needed. In children additional tests may be required such as urine biochemistry and blood testing looking for metabolic disorders.|$|E
5|$|Later in the game's development, Chahi added laser pistols, {{including}} the one that Lester carries for several effects. The idea {{was influenced by the}} Star Wars franchise, but added depth to the gameplay by giving the player more options. He also found that repeated laser fire by the enemies helped to enunciate <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. Chahi would later add in the plasma ball that increased the available strategy to players. Several points in the game use elevators or teleporters to move Lester between levels; Chahi had used these instead of stairways, as it was difficult to produce proper animation for these.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Shiny Festa eschews {{the simulation}} format of previous Idolmaster games, and instead features a rhythmic gameplay {{in which the}} player times the presses of buttons to <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs and a predetermined pattern displayed on the screen. Each game features a different array of characters and songs, and also includes an original video animation episode produced by A-1 Pictures and directed by Atsushi Nishigori. The games' story centers on the 765 Production's participation in a music festival, and is told via the anime episodes and occasional dialogue included in the games.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} the video was meant to {{illustrate}} the lyrics of the song. It depicts the sexual fantasies of a rich and bored housewife played by Beyoncé who tries to seduce her man while having breakfast at her house wearing a white robe. The video opens with various shots of a big mansion in which the singer is seen {{in one of the}} rooms. She tries to get her man's attention while he reads a newspaper. As he does not notice her, she throws a napkin on the floor and her female servant comes to lift it. The clip transitions to scenes of Beyoncé dressed in a Victorian jeweled outfit with a mask in her hands, lip-syncing the lyrics and dancing to <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song. Afterwards, she is seen entering a limousine in which Jay-Z is already inside. Scenes of Beyoncé with a black coat and lingerie walking in front of the car are also intertwined throughout.|$|E

25|$|Apparent lack <b>of</b> regular <b>rhythm,</b> {{especially}} in <b>the</b> siguiriyas: <b>the</b> melodic <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sung line {{is different from}} <b>the</b> metric <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accompaniment.|$|R

30|$|At {{least two}} rhythms {{characterize}} a burster: <b>the</b> fast <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oscillations within the active phase, and <b>the</b> slower <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alternation between active and silent phases.|$|R

25|$|This {{addition}} {{was probably}} not done by Coleridge and does not match <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest of the poem.

25|$|A {{number of}} chironomid species inhabit marine habitats. Midges {{of the genus}} Clunio {{are found in the}} {{intertidal}} zone, where they have adjusted their entire life cycle to <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tides. This made the species Clunio marinus an important model species for research in the field of chronobiology.|$|E

5000|$|The work {{centers around}} delayed {{repetition}} {{between the two}} pianos, creating an effect of echoing sonorities. There is a constant shift of pulse and meter, but <b>the</b> main <b>rhythms</b> are based on <b>the</b> <b>rhythms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> word [...] "Hal-le-LU-jah".|$|R
25|$|The entire cast {{was also}} replaced: Harry Potter's Lee Ingleby and Downton Abbey's Joanne Froggatt were {{confirmed}} to voice Bob and Wendy respectively. The music was also remastered but <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main theme remained {{very much the}} same, and the lyrics were given only minor alterations due {{to the introduction of}} new characters.|$|E
25|$|Pair sticks, {{sometimes}} called clapsticks or bilma, establish the beat for the songs during ceremonies. <b>The</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> didgeridoo and {{the beat of}} the clapsticks are precise, and these patterns have been handed down for many generations. In the Wangga genre, the song-man starts with vocals and then introduces blima to the accompaniment of didgeridoo.|$|E
25|$|An extra scene, {{involving}} Jones {{taking off}} her chain-metal dress which is {{ringing off the}} metal detectors and walking through them naked, was shot in Newark Airport. However, the filmmakers felt it to be too shocking, {{to the point where}} it threw <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> picture off, so they only used it in the small clip being edited for the perfume commercial.|$|E
25|$|Gelineau {{was himself}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> working group <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Jerusalem Bible and he {{developed}} a revised version of that psalter which respected <b>the</b> <b>rhythms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hebrew original.

25|$|Co-written with David Kalish, {{this is a}} bebop {{tribute to}} 1950s R icons, with a finger-snapping guitar riff and an in-studio male vocal chorus. It {{is one of the}} album's most upbeat songs {{and one of the few}} not to feature {{significant}} tempo/rhythm changes. <b>The</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song is driven by a funk style bass line played by Chuck Rainey and percussion boxes and thighs played by Steve Gadd.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{cessation}} of respiration, an obvious sign of sudden death, the {{cessation of}} circulation, and particularly <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart, is not as easy to spot for a lay observer, although a trained eye now can see signs such as lack of perfusion. Perhaps {{as a result of}} this being less obvious, the appreciation of artificial circulation as a key factor in resuscitation lagged considerably behind the obvious need for artificial respirations.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} when human muscles were the only power source {{available}} aboard ship, shanties served practical functions. <b>The</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song served to synchronize {{the movements of the}} sailors or to pace the labor as they toiled at repetitive tasks. Singing helped to alleviate boredom and to lighten, perhaps, the psychological burden of hard work. Shanties may also be said to have served a social purpose, as to build camaraderie.|$|E

25|$|The {{windows of}} the top floor are far shorter {{than those of the}} floors below and <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{fenestration}} is faster, being two windows to each of those on the floors below.

25|$|Conservative and Reform Judaism {{have altered}} the text to varying degrees to bring it into {{alignment}} with their view of modern needs and sensibilities. Conservative Judaism retains the traditional number and time periods during which the Amidah must be said, while omitting explicit supplications for restoration of the sacrifices. Reconstructionist and Reform Judaism, consistent with their views that <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient sacrifices should no longer drive modern Jewish prayer, often omit some of the Amidah prayers, such as the Mussaf, omit temporal requirements, and omit references to the Temple and its sacrifices.|$|E
25|$|The term paysagisme abstrait (literally, {{abstract}} landscapism) {{could be}} reserved for a process where the artist senses and tries to capture the 'rhythms' of a landscape. This concept of rhythm is explicitly mentioned {{by a number of}} painters in addition to Messagier; Jean René Bazaine, Raoul Ubac and Zao Wou Ki. <b>The</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landscape is experienced by the artist and expressed by the gesture; something the viewer in turn would experience as sensation. The landscape in this case is a direct source of inspiration. It must be felt.|$|E
50|$|Ayla conveys to Yusuf Zehra's {{pledge to}} {{sacrifice}} a lamb {{after her death}} and tells Yusuf {{that he has to}} carry out his mother's wishes.
