Different types of coding schemes have been proposed, such as rate coding and temporal coding. Neural oscillations could create periodic time windows in which input spikes have larger effect on neurons, thereby providing a mechanism for decoding temporal codes.|$|E

25|$|It {{may be that}} non-colonizing technologically capable alien civilizations exist, {{but that}} they are simply too far apart for {{meaningful}} two-way communication. If two civilizations are separated by several thousand light-years, {{it is possible that}} one or both cultures may become extinct before meaningful dialogue can be established. Human searches may be able to detect their existence, but communication will remain impossible because of distance. It has been suggested that this problem might be ameliorated somewhat if contact/communication is made through a Bracewell probe. In this case at least one partner in the exchange may obtain meaningful information. Alternatively, a civilization may simply broadcast its knowledge, and leave it to the receiver to make what they may of it. This is similar to the transmission of information from ancient civilizations to the present, and humanity has undertaken similar activities like the Arecibo message, which could <b>transfer</b> <b>information</b> about Earth's intelligent species, even if it never yields a response or does not yield a response in time for humanity to receive it. It is also possible that archaeological evidence of past civilizations may be detected through deep space observations.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{data was}} simply passed one-way from a central {{processing}} unit (CPU) to a graphics processing unit (GPU), then to a display device. However, as time progressed, it became valuable for GPUs to store at first simple, then complex structures of data to be passed back to the CPU that analyzed an image, or a set of scientific-data represented as a 2D or 3D format that a video card can understand. Because the GPU has access to every draw operation, it can analyze data in these forms quickly, whereas a CPU must poll every pixel or data element much more slowly, as the speed of access between a CPU and its larger pool of random-access memory (or in an even worse case, a hard drive) is slower than GPUs and video cards, which typically contain smaller amounts of more expensive memory that is much faster to access. Transferring {{the portion of the}} data set to be actively analyzed to that GPU memory in the form of textures or other easily readable GPU forms results in speed increase. The distinguishing feature of a GPGPU design is the ability to <b>transfer</b> <b>information</b> bidirectionally back from the GPU to the CPU; generally the data throughput in both directions is ideally high, resulting in a multiplier effect on the speed of a specific high-use algorithm. GPGPU pipelines may improve efficiency on especially large data sets and/or data containing 2D or 3D imagery. It is used in complex graphics pipelines as well as scientific computing; more so in fields with large data sets like genome mapping, or where two- or three-dimensional analysis is useful especially at present biomolecule analysis, protein study, and other complex organic chemistry. Such pipelines can also vastly improve efficiency in image processing and computer vision, among other fields; as well as parallel processing generally. Some very heavily optimized pipelines have yielded speed increases of several hundred times the original CPU-based pipeline on one high-use task.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, Bart Kahr {{from the}} University of Washington and colleagues {{reported}} their experiments that tested {{the idea that}} crystals {{can act as a}} source of transferable information, using crystals of potassium hydrogen phthalate. [...] "Mother" [...] crystals with imperfections were cleaved and used as seeds to grow [...] "daughter" [...] crystals from solution. They then examined the distribution of imperfections in the new crystals and found that the imperfections in the mother crystals were reproduced in the daughters, but the daughter crystals also had many additional imperfections. For gene-like behaviour to be observed, the quantity of inheritance of these imperfections should have exceeded that of the mutations in the successive generations, but it did not. Thus Kahr concluded that the crystals [...] "were not faithful enough to store and <b>transfer</b> <b>information</b> {{from one generation to the}} next." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} design and {{operational}} problems have been identified. Despite having an 'exclusive' bus lane, unauthorised vehicles illegally using the lanes {{in an attempt to}} more quickly navigate through the traffic jams are a common problem. Depot maintenance shops and special gas stations (most buses use compressed natural gas (CNG)) often have long lines of buses, restricting the availability of buses for service. The CNG powered buses also have suffered from higher fuel consumption than expected (1 litre for 1.3km vs. 2.1km as specified) and high oil and moisture content requiring extra maintenance. Other problems identified were: a lack of feeder bus services, a lack of adequate <b>transfer</b> <b>information</b> and transfer facilities and a lack of articulated buses. [...] A 2010 survey showed 75% of passengers transferred from medium or micro buses to the TransJarkara buses and it was estimated if 'direct service' operations were implemented (i.e., multiple stopping points at some stations with bypass lanes and some services continuing beyond the trunk corridors) patronage would increase by 50%. [...] A feeder bus service called APTB was introduced in 2012.|$|E

We perform experiments in simulation and with real robots. Furthermore, we show that the same explicit <b>information</b> <b>transfer</b> strategies can also be applied to another collective behavior: collective transport with obstacle avoidance. In implicit <b>information</b> <b>transfer,</b> directional <b>information</b> is <b>transferred</b> without communication. We show that a simple motion control method is sufficient to guarantee cohesive and aligned motion without resorting to communication or elaborate sensing. We analyze the motion control method for its capability to achieve flocking with and without a desired direction of motion, both in simulation and using real robots. Furthermore, to better understand its underlying mechanism, we study this method using tools of statistical physics, showing that the process can be explained in terms of non-linear elasticity and energy-cascading dynamics.

40|$|Abstract Background In the Netherlands, the {{increase}} in of out-of-hours care that is provided by GP co-operatives is challenging the continuity of care for the terminally ill in general practice. Aim {{of this study is}} to investigate the views of general practitioners (GPs) on the <b>transfer</b> of <b>information</b> about terminally ill patients to the GP co-operatives. GPs were asked to give their view from two different perspectives: as a GP in their daily practice and as a locum in the GP co-operative. Methods Retrospective web based questionnaire sent to all 424 GPs in the Amsterdam region. Results With a response rate of 42 %, 177 physicians completed the questionnaire. <b>Transfer</b> of <b>information</b> to the GP co-operative about most of their terminally ill patients was reported by 82 % of the GPs and 5 % did not do so for any of their patients. A faster than foreseen deterioration of the patient's situation was the most frequently reported reason for not <b>transferring</b> <b>information.</b> Of those who <b>transferred</b> <b>information</b> to the GP co-operative, more than 95 % reported that they provided information about the diagnosis and terminally ill status of the patient. Information about medication, patient wishes regarding treatment, and prognosis was reported by respectively 90 %, 87 %, and 74 % of the GPs. Less than 50 % of the GPs reported that they <b>transferred</b> <b>information</b> about the patient's awareness of both the diagnosis and the prognosis, about the psychosocial context, and intolerances. In their role as locum, over 90 % of the GPs wanted to receive information about the diagnosis, the terminally ill status of the patient, the medication and the patient's wishes regarding treatment. Conclusions Although most GPs reported that they <b>transferred</b> <b>information</b> about their terminally ill patients to the GP co-operative, the content of this information varies considerably. Only 21 % of the GPs, working out of hours as a locum, were satisfied with the quality of the <b>information</b> <b>transferred.</b> </p...|$|R
