5|$|As {{tensions}} rose {{between the}} colonists and Britain {{in the early}} 1770s, Philipse remained loyal to the crown. He was arrested in August 1776 and held in Connecticut until a parole grant {{at the end of}} the year allowed him to return home as long as he did nothing to support the British war effort. He broke <b>that</b> <b>promise</b> the next spring: he attempted, perhaps at the behest of his wife, to inform the British that a passing column of Continental Army troops was headed south to attack a British camp at Morrisania, now in the Bronx. Shortly afterwards he fled to British-occupied New York; he would never return to his home along the Saw Mill.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two games of the season, Tech {{followed}} through on <b>that</b> <b>promise,</b> winning 3316 and 6321 against Bowling Green and Pittsburgh, respectively. A loss to No.3 Miami followed, but a victory over Maryland in the game that followed gave Tech a 31 record, already better than its 1992 win total. After a close loss at No.14 West Virginia that was determined by a missed last-second field goal by Tech placekicker Ryan Williams, the Hokies won five of their last six regular-season games. These wins included victories over Big East opponent Syracuse and No.23 , Tech's traditional rival. With an 83 regular-season record and ranked No.22 in the country by the Associated Press, Tech was extended an invitation to the Independence Bowl, its first bowl bid since the 1986 Peach Bowl.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} {{season in the}} Mountain West, the Bulldogs became co-champions with a 7-1 conference record. This was the Bulldogs' first {{appearance}} in the Hawaii Bowl. Coming into the 2012 season, Bulldogs' coach Tim DeRuyter said that his team would challenge for a Mountain West Conference title. After making good on <b>that</b> <b>promise,</b> the Bulldogs attempted to achieve their first bowl victory since the 2007 Humanitarian Bowl. A victory in the Hawaii Bowl would have given Fresno State a 10-win season {{for the first time}} since 2001, when quarterback Derek Carr's older brother David was the Bulldogs' quarterback.|$|E

5|$|After {{a disappointing}} 2007–08 season, Senators' {{management}} promised change, {{and in the}} off-season fulfilled <b>that</b> <b>promise</b> with changes both in coaching and on-ice personnel. On June 13, 2008, the Senators named Craig Hartsburg, who had been {{head coach of the}} OHL's Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, as the new head coach, signing him to a three-year contract. The Senators also named Curtis Hunt, formerly of the Regina Pats, as assistant coach. On the player side, the first change was the buy-out of troubled goaltender Ray Emery's contract following a difficult season. Long-time Senator Wade Redden left via free-agency, and 2007–08 trade acquisitions Mike Commodore, Cory Stillman and Martin Lapointe were not re-signed. Brian McGrattan and Andrej Meszaros were traded, Meszaros following a contract dispute. From the free agent market, the Senators signed goaltender Alex Auld, defenceman Jason Smith, and agitating forward Jarkko Ruutu. In exchange for Meszaros, defencemen Filip Kuba, Alexandre Picard and a 2009 first-round draft pick (later dealt for defenceman Chris Campoli) were acquired from the Tampa Bay Lightning.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Indiana Jones {{narrowly}} escapes {{the clutches}} of Lao Che, a crime boss in Shanghai, China. With his 11-year-old Chinese sidekick Short Round and the nightclub singer Willie Scott in tow, Indy flees Shanghai on an airplane that, unknown to them, is owned by Lao. While {{the three of them}} sleep on the plane, the pilots parachute out, and they leave the plane to crash over the Himalayas while dumping its fuel. Indy, Shorty, and Willie discover this and narrowly manage to escape by jumping out of the plane on an inflatable raft, and then riding down the slopes into a raging river. They come to Mayapore, a village in northern India, where the poor villagers believe them to have been sent by Shiva to retrieve the sacred sivalinga stone stolen from their shrine, as well as the community's children, from evil forces in the nearby Pankot Palace. During the journey to Pankot, Indy hypothesizes that the stone {{may be one of the}} five fabled Sankara stones <b>that</b> <b>promise</b> fortune and glory.|$|E

25|$|Health {{problems}} caused {{by the lack of}} safe water are exacerbated by poor sanitary conditions, especially in rural China. Traditionally, Chinese households collect human waste and transport it to the fields for use as fertilizer, often without further treatment. Latrines are common in rural areas. Some are rudimentary, being unprotected from flies and other disease vectors, while others are odorless and insect-free. Composting toilets <b>that</b> <b>promise</b> high rates of pathogen destruction are common. The availability of public and school latrines in rural areas that met sanitary standards was low in the late 1990s.|$|E

The NHL, to quell the controversy, promised the fans of Minnesota a return in the future with a new franchise; <b>that</b> <b>promise</b> was fulfilled in 2000 when Minnesota was awarded the Minnesota Wild as an expansion franchise.

25|$|Promissory {{estoppel}} is {{the doctrine}} that prevents a party from {{acting in a}} certain way because the first party promised not to, and the second party relied on <b>that</b> <b>promise</b> and acted upon it. In English law, a promise made without consideration is generally not enforceable, and is known as a gratuitous promise. For example, a car salesman promises not to sell a car over the weekend, but does so, the promise cannot be enforced. If however, the car salesman accepts one penny in consideration for the promise, the promise is binding and enforceable in court. Estoppel is one of the exceptions to this rule.|$|E
25|$|The {{proof of}} {{possible}} detriment or prejudice, which will appear if the promisor {{is allowed to}} revert to his original promise, is required. In Ajayi V.

(1972) 2 QB 18, Denning detained that detriment is not an essential element of promissory estoppel. Therefore, for a plea of promissory estoppel to succeed, there must be a change in circumstances of the promisee. This elementary composition of promissory estoppel has been the core and central topic of discussion {{in the evolution of the}} doctrine.|$|E
25|$|Although Bane {{had sworn}} off using Venom in Vengeance of Bane II in 1995, and his {{character}} is actually written as having kept <b>that</b> <b>promise</b> to himself, {{it is still}} not uncommon for artists to draw Bane as still wearing the tube leading from his old wrist device {{to the back of his}} head, as well as almost all media adaptations of the character show him actively using the Venom compound. Writer Gail Simone explained these lapses in the continuity of Bane's appearance in an issue of Secret Six, in which Deadshot remarked that Bane merely kept his old Venom equipment with him out of habit, even though Bane states that he would sooner die than use it again.|$|E
