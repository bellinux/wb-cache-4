25|$|The AJ, SF, SH and SK 37 {{models of}} the Viggen had {{the first version of}} the RM8A engine with uprated {{internal}} components from the JT8D that it was based on. Thrust was 65.6kN dry and 115.6kN with afterburner. For the JA 37, the RM8A was developed into the RM8B, achieved by adding a third low-pressure compressor stage over the preceding model, increasing the <b>turbine</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>temperature</b> and fuel diffusion within the combustion chamber. Thrust is 72.1kN dry and 125.0kN with afterburner. Due to the increased length and weight of the RM8B engine over its predecessor, the airframe of the JA 37 was stretched in order to accommodate it. Onboard electrical power was provided by a 60 kVA generator. In the event of an in-flight engine failure, emergency power was provided by an automatically deploying ram air turbine (RAT), capable of generating 6 kVA.|$|E

40|$|Efficiency {{and power}} output of gas {{turbines}} improve {{with an increase}} in <b>turbine</b> rotor <b>inlet</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Innovative cooling methods are used by blade designers to raise <b>turbine</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>temperatures</b> to levels higher than the melting temperatures of the blade material. These increased <b>turbine</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>temperatures</b> are achieved by utilizing a combination of internal convective cooling and external film-cooling. Internal convective cooling, flowing air through the internal passages of the blade, is further augmented by pin fin arrays. These pin fins serve to turbulate the air thereby augmenting convective cooling. The coolant flow exits internal cooling passages to the external side of the blade and forms a protective layer along the external surface of the blade further cooling the blade. In the current study, a novel low-speed large-scale wind tunnel facility was developed with the capability to measure internal heat transfer coefficients, using thermal liquid crystallography, and external adiabatic effectiveness, using infrared thermography. The test facility has been used to characterize several proprietary cooling configurations, and is currently in use for the testing of public pin fin designs...|$|R

50|$|To {{illustrate}} {{one aspect}} of how a turbofan differs from a turbojet they may be compared, as in a re-engining assessment, at the same airflow (to keep a common intake for example) and the same net thrust (i.e. same specific thrust). A bypass flow can be added only if the <b>turbine</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>temperature</b> is not too high {{to compensate for the}} smaller core flow. Future improvements in turbine cooling/material technology can allow higher <b>turbine</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>temperature,</b> which is necessary because of increased cooling air temperature, resulting from any overall pressure ratio increase.|$|E
5000|$|Specific thrust (net thrust/intake airflow) is an {{important}} parameter for turbofans and jet engines in general. Imagine a fan (driven by an appropriately sized electric motor) operating within a pipe, which is connected to a propelling nozzle. It is fairly obvious, the higher the fan pressure ratio (fan discharge pressure/fan inlet pressure), the higher the jet velocity and the corresponding specific thrust. Now imagine we replace this set-up with an equivalent turbofan - same airflow and same fan pressure ratio. Obviously, {{the core of the}} turbofan must produce sufficient power to drive the fan via the low-pressure (LP) turbine. If we choose a low (HP) <b>turbine</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>temperature</b> for the gas generator, the core airflow needs to be relatively high to compensate. The corresponding bypass ratio is therefore relatively low. If we raise the <b>turbine</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>temperature,</b> the core airflow can be smaller, thus increasing bypass ratio. Raising <b>turbine</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>temperature</b> tends to increase thermal efficiency and, therefore, improve fuel efficiency.|$|E

The rotor flow-path design seeks to realize improved aerodynamic blade loading characteristics and high efficiency while satisfying rotor life requirements.
