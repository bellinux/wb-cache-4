25|$|I think I thought I {{could handle}} things. Didn't {{know how to}} shoot music. Music had been {{important}} in my films, it was usually post production. This was tough stuff to shoot. I already had a great respect for people like Minnelli. I just couldn't seem {{to work it out}} without just putting up multiple cameras and shooting an awful lot of film... I later realized or talked to people about this and MGM in the old days everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don't get that. We would stage it and shoot it. We got the songs a lot of times just a few days before we shoot. We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn't have. It made a very inefficient shoot. I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>any</b> other way to do it given the circumstances.|$|E

500|$|Sadleir notes how Walpole's {{considerable}} income {{enabled him}} to indulge not only his love of art and of old books and manuscripts, but also philanthropy, particularly towards younger writers. Although Walpole enjoyed the limelight, he was secretive about his many acts of generosity to younger writers, with both encouragement and financial help. After his death {{some idea of the}} scale of his generosity was discovered. Osbert Sitwell commented, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>any</b> younger writer of any worth who has not {{at one time or another}} received kindness of an active kind, and at a crucial moment, from Hugh". Hart-Davis lists thirty-eight authors from whom letters of gratitude were found among Walpole's correspondence; Sadleir writes of Walpole's [...] "generous kindness to literary aspirants and to writers fallen on evil days... by immediate financial assistance, by prefaces freely supplied or by collaboration volunteered, by introductions and recommendations to likely publishers, Walpole relieved the distresses of authorship to a degree which will never be fully known." [...] Agate, though himself the recipient of Walpole's generosity on occasion, thought it sometimes went too far: [...] "Mr Walpole's large-heartedness gets him into all kinds of trouble. He is an inveterate patter. He pats on the back young men whom sterner critics would knock down, because even in fantastic incompetence he perceives the good intention. No art or artist is safe from Mr Walpole's benevolence".|$|E

500|$|Soaps In Depth {{reported}} that Engen quickly gained viewer support after joining the cast as Adam, {{as did the}} character's romance with Heather. The support continued when the character took a dark turn. Engen said, [...] "To <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>any</b> likability left in the character baffles me! I'm very grateful to the fans...they've been so supportive." [...] The actor said fans wanted Adam either redeemed or turned into a gray character. Davidson credited the character's likability to Engen's looks, saying, [...] "...he really nailed this character. Chris' all-American looks add another layer to this story: {{he looks like he}} regrets being so evil, but he can't help himself. When Chris informed me he was leaving, I told him he really accomplished something by being so likable playing this villain." [...] Nelson Branco repeatedly praised Engen's acting and Adam's storyline with Ashley and Victor, saying, [...] "he Haunting of Ashley is fast becoming one of my favorite all-time soap storylines ever. It's so 1970s. I have no doubt former Another World master scribe and Paul Rauch BFF/frenemy, Harding Lemay, is freaking if he's watching this gothic, macabre and super-creepy mystery. Moreover, camp-ilicious Chris Engen (Adam) is stealing the story with his very bitchy, and sexy performance of a deranged son scorned." [...] Soaps In Depth also commended Adam's storyline. The magazine awarded Engen a gold star for portraying Adam as a gray character with [...] "sardonic humor". Soap Opera Digest named Engen [...] "performer of the week" [...] for his final scenes as Adam, saying the actor [...] "gave a performance that elevated Adam from an average villain to a complex mastermind".|$|E
2500|$|During {{the same}} period, federal Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Judy Sgro {{was criticized for}} {{granting}} a temporary residency permit to Romanian exotic dancer who had worked on her election campaign. [...] Sgro denied she had done anything wrong, and argued that she granted the permit on compassionate grounds. [...] In {{the aftermath of the}} controversy, the Martin government eliminated a federal program that allowed foreign-born exotic dancers to enter the country. [...] Volpe was given credit for this decision and was quoted as saying, [...] "I didn't feel in the slightest bit comfortable with the program and I didn't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>any</b> justification for it".|$|E
2500|$|The {{theoretical}} {{underpinnings of}} Moniz's psychosurgery were largely {{commensurate with the}} nineteenth century ones that had informed Burckhardt's decision to excise matter from the brains of his patients. Although in his later writings Moniz referenced both the neuron theory of Ramón y Cajal and the conditioned reflex of Ivan Pavlov, in essence he simply interpreted this new neurological research {{in terms of the}} old psychological theory of associationism. He differed significantly from Burckhardt, however in that he did not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>any</b> organic pathology in the brains of the mentally ill, but rather that their neural pathways were caught in fixed and destructive circuits leading to [...] "predominant, obsessive ideas." [...] As Moniz wrote in 1936: ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{the series}} entered its second season, Fox {{announced}} an additional tour leg in Europe. Murphy responds {{that the show}} in the U.S. saw an amazing response and the tour extension was to thank the fans overseas for their dedication to the series and promised an additional U.S. tour {{in the summer of}} 2011. Amber Riley (Mercedes Jones) shared the cast's enthusiasm for the tour extension remarking, [...] "I loved performing for the fans in Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix and New York last year and didn’t <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>any</b> way to top that experience. But performing in the great arenas of London, Manchester and Dublin? How cool is that? We cannot wait." [...] Joining the tour extension are new cast members Chord Overstreet (Sam Evans), Ashley Fink (Lauren Zizes) and Darren Criss (Blaine Anderson).|$|E
2500|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>any</b> {{intention}} of a coup," [...] Carlos Ortega, {{president of the}} Venezuelan Workers Confederation, later told The Los Angeles Times. Newsday indicated that it was Ortega and other protest leaders who called for participants to march to Miraflores. [...] "Many marchers said they thought the call to proceed to Miraflores was spontaneous," [...] reported Newsday, but some planners [...] "said the idea had always been to bring crowds to Miraflores to demand Chávez's resignation once they had sufficient turnout and a pledge from the military that it would second their call for his ouster." [...] At the palace the protesters shouted [...] "Chávez Out!" [...] The New York Times quoted Ortega as shouting: [...] "Chávez get out!... We do not want you! We reject you!" [...] Shortly after the protesters arrived at Miraflores, Chávez issued a call for calm on national TV. According to an opinion piece by Sandra Hernandez, opposition TV aired images of anti-Chávez protesters outside the palace being beaten by troops.|$|E
2500|$|At the 1978 US Open, Evert {{would play}} sixteen-year-old Pam Shriver in the final. [...] Shriver showed Evert {{she was to}} be taken seriously in the match by winning her first service game at 15 points for Evert, which was {{the first game of the}} match. [...] Evert would have a hard time shaking Shriver off during the first set because of mostly double {{faulting}} three-times in one game in the eight game of the set to allow Shriver to break back to level the set 4-games all. [...] Evert would lose the next game to go down 4 games to 5, which she said [...] "I was disgusted with those three double-faults...when I get nervous, serving is one of the first things that goes. [...] But even at 5-4, I felt very confident. [...] I didn't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>any</b> way I could lose." [...] During the subsequent game, Evert would only lose one point on serve to get the match back level at 5 games-all. [...] In the critical 11-game, Evert would show why experience matters and broke the youngster's serve, which allowed Evert to win the opening set 7 games to 5. [...] Evert and Shriver would battle to an even 4-all in the second set before the youngster showed her inexperience by having a 40 to love game, and simply put Shriver could not close it out against the relentless effort of Evert. [...] The points after this was the following: Evert winning on a forehand return, then made a winning volley, then got deuce with a galloping forehand up the line, Shriver won the next point with a booming service to get the advantage with a volley, Shriver on game point lead her forehand astray, lastly Evert won the game by hitting two unreturnable returns. [...] In the tenth game of the set, Shriver tried her best by getting most shots back, but Evert still won the set 6 games to 4, which gave Evert her fourth US Open title in a row and first one on the hard DecoTurf. [...] Evert later said [...] "I felt hungary to win...When the chips were down, I went for passing shots and made them. [...] I hit the lines." ...|$|E
