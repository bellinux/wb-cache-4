5|$|As {{a result}} of the losses it had suffered, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) had ceased <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> {{fighting}} force. Following a series of raids on the Japanese shipyard at Kure, Japan, the only major warships in fighting order were six aircraft carriers, four cruisers, and one battleship, none of which could be fueled adequately. Although 19destroyers and 38submarines were still operational, their use was limited by the lack of fuel.|$|E
5|$|At Chelsea, Fàbregas {{played a}} similar playmaking role in midfield, using his technique, ball control, vision, and passing ability to dictate the tempo of his team's play, {{while he was}} {{supported}} by defensive midfielders, {{in order to give}} him more space and time on the ball. In this deeper creative role, he excelled in Chelsea's new style of play under Mourinho, where he proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> assist-provider.|$|E

5|$|Recompression on air {{was shown}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> {{treatment}} for minor DCS symptoms by Keays in 1909. Evidence {{of the effectiveness}} of recompression therapy utilizing oxygen was first shown by Yarbrough and Behnke, and has since become the standard of care for treatment of DCS. Recompression is normally carried out in a recompression chamber. At a dive site, a riskier alternative is in-water recompression.|$|E
5|$|Another method {{adopted in}} the past to tackle the phumdis was by way of {{diverting}} them towards the Khordak River. However, as this approach had not been very successful, the State Government planned to construct a canal at Tera Khunou Khong Ahanbi to divert the phumdis to Manipur River. Other methods adopted by the Loktak Development Authority (LDA) to control phumdis and water hyacinth include introducing weevils for the biological control of water hyacinth, which was carried out in collaboration with the Horticulture Institute of Bangalore. Reports have shown this <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> method in controlling water hyacinth.|$|E
5|$|Azelaic acid {{has been}} shown to be {{effective}} for mild to moderate acne when applied topically at a 20% concentration. Treatment twice daily for six months is necessary, and is as effective as topical benzoyl peroxide5%, isotretinoin0.05%, and erythromycin2%. Azelaic acid is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> acne treatment due to its ability to reduce skin cell accumulation in the follicle, and its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. It has a slight skin-lightening effect due to its ability to inhibit melanin synthesis, and is therefore useful in treating of individuals with acne who are also affected by postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Azelaic acid may cause skin irritation but is otherwise very safe. It is less effective and more expensive than retinoids.|$|E

5|$|From its {{formation}} in 1936, Coastal Command {{did not receive}} the support it required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> naval air service. In September 1939 Nazi Germany invaded Poland beginning the war in Europe. The Command's position was comfortable {{for the first nine}} months of the war, the period known as the Phoney War. German submarines were not able to reach the Atlantic unless they undertook a dangerous transit journey through the North Sea and around Britain's northern waters or through the English Channel, which was guarded by the Royal and French Navies. The powerful French Navy was responsible for covering half of the Atlantic shipping routes and thus contributed half of the Allied forces available.|$|E
5|$|In the Atlantic, escort {{carriers}} {{proved to}} be a vital part of Allied convoys, increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the Mid-Atlantic gap. Carriers were also more economical than battleships because of the relatively low cost of aircraft and their not requiring to be as heavily armoured. Submarines, which had proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> weapon during the First World War, were anticipated by all sides to be important in the second. The British focused development on anti-submarine weaponry and tactics, such as sonar and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the Type VII submarine and wolfpack tactics. Gradually, improving Allied technologies such as the Leigh light, hedgehog, squid, and homing torpedoes proved victorious.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} {{specialized}} archipelago vessels, the hemmema had specific strengths and weaknesses. Although it had superior firepower relative to galleys, its sailing qualities were somewhat mediocre and while highly manoeuvrable under oars, {{it was still}} difficult to propel while rowed. A hemmema had the potential <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> weapon against galleys, matching their forward firepower and severely outgunning them with its broadside armament. Inside an enemy galley formation, it could wreak considerable havoc, but such a maneuver was never achieved in an actual battle, leaving that tactical role untested.|$|E

Effects of asymmetric external potential, the modified Frenkel-Kontorova one, on the heat conduction of system are also studied. It is found that the asymmetric property of external potential can induce asymmetric thermal conductivity that can <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>effective</b> thermal rectifier. In certain of system parameters the heat flux are significantly different for two opposite direction. One can parametrically control the heat flux through this system by changing the potential strength and width. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

5|$|Trillium grandiflorum {{has been}} studied {{extensively}} by ecologists due {{to a number of}} unique features it possesses. It is a representative example of a plant whose seeds are spread through myrmecochory, or ant-mediated dispersal, which is effective in increasing the plant's ability to outcross, but ineffective in bringing the plant very far. This has led ecologists to question how it and similar plants were able to survive glaciation events during the ice ages. The height of the species has also been shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> index of how intense foraging by deer is in a particular area.|$|E
5|$|In May 1995, the Nordiques {{announced}} that the team had been sold and were relocating from Quebec. Before {{the start of the}} 1995–96 season, the franchise moved to Denver, Colorado, and was renamed the Colorado Avalanche. Sakic led the team to its first Stanley Cup championship, scoring 120 points in 82 regular season games and 34 points in 22 playoff games. He was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the 1996 NHL playoffs. During the run for the Cup, Sakic again proved himself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> team leader. Although his Nordiques had missed the playoffs in five of his first seven years in the NHL, he scored 18 goals, including six game-winners, and 34 points. He was one goal off from the record for goals in a playoff year, and his game-winning goals established a new record.|$|E
5|$|The one reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1000 feet long, {{was released}} on July 29, 1910. The film likely had a wide release, but another film {{of the same name}} was released by Società Anonima Ambrosio. The Ambrosio film {{was released on}} November 16, 1910, but several theater advertisements are ambiguous as to the film being shown. It is known that Ambroiso and Thanhouser films were sometimes shown together, as one Maryland theater advertisement shows, further complicating identification. The film received mainly positive reviews from critics. The Morning Telegraph found the story to have a novel way of advertising a hotel, but noted the error in the photographer's attempt and result to photograph the mermaid. The Moving Picture World found the film <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> production, but spared few details and a short summary of the film. The most critical review came from The New York Dramatic Mirror which was neutral in its assessment of the production, but it provided a list of faults with the production that focused on continuity issues with action.|$|E

5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela is {{a member}} of the genus Myzomela which includes two other Australian species, the scarlet myzomela of eastern Australia, and the dusky myzomela of northern Australia. It belongs to the honeyeater family Meliphagidae. A 2004 genetic study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of honeyeaters found it to be the next closest relative to a smaller group consisting of the scarlet and cardinal myzomelas, although only five of the thirty members of the genus Myzomela were analysed. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA suggests that the ancestor of the red-headed myzomela diverged from that of the black-breasted myzomela around 4 million years ago, however the relationships of many species within the genus is uncertain. Molecular analysis has shown honeyeaters to be related to the Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and the Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea. Because the red-headed myzomela occurs on many offshore islands and appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> water-crosser, it has been hypothesised that north-western Australia was the primary centre of origin for the two subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The streak was {{initially}} overshadowed by Hershiser achieving 20 wins {{and the race}} for the NL Cy Young Award between Hershiser and Danny Jackson until Hershiser reached 40 consecutive innings. Another distraction during the streak was his wife's pregnancy and his son's childbirth complications. The record-setting game was overshadowed by the 1988 Summer Olympics, football, and baseball pennant races; it was not broadcast on local television in Los Angeles. Following the regular season, Hershiser was awarded the NL Cy Young Award. In the playoffs, he earned both the NL Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award and the World Series MVP Award. He also secured Sportsman of the Year and Associated Press Athlete of the Year honors. Hershiser appeared in the 1989 MLB All-Star Game and continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> pitcher for many seasons, including two additional appearances in the World Series, one of which was preceded by his winning the 1995 AL Championship Series MVP Award.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} held {{a number}} of lessons for the Australians, not least {{of all was the}} need for tanks. Although the APCs had been used to support the infantry during the operation, they lacked the firepower and armour <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> substitute for tanks which would likely have found the terrain and vegetation no obstacle and may have proven decisive. Meanwhile, the futility and waste of frontal tactics and massed bayonet charges against automatic weapons had once again been demonstrated. Yet such lessons still had not been fully grasped by Australian Army training doctrine, and under pressure from Townsend to press on with the attack Mackay had given the order to fix bayonets and charge due to the proximity of his forward platoons to the Viet Cong. Despite having long since ceased to be a decisive weapon of warfare, when ordered the Australians had unhesitatingly charged towards the Viet Cong machine-guns in the certainty of suffering casualties. As a result of their bravery 5 Platoon {{became one of the most}} highly decorated Australian platoons of the war. Yet aggression alone could not overcome concentrated firepower, and many survivors were later bitter about the order and losses suffered in these attempts. Another lesson identified included the need to thoroughly prepare an unsecure landing zone by fire prior to insertion. Likewise, during the initial contact A Company had been unable to call in artillery, and the need for a dedicated command and control helicopter to co-ordinate indirect fire during an airmobile assault was also evident.|$|E
