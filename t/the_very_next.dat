Although Bukhara was recovered by the Arabs at this time, either under Ashras or under Junayd, in <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>next</b> year the latter led the Khurasani army to disaster in the Battle of the Defile, an event which shattered the tenuous Arab control over what remained of their possessions in Transoxiana.
