500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 4 out of 4 stars, calling it [...] "one {{of the best}} police movies in recent years, a virtuoso fusion of {{performances}} and often startling action", {{and went on to}} name the film the fourth best of 2012. Film critic James Berardinelli described End of Watch as [...] "satisfying and emotionally potent ... a good, gritty drama of the sort that seems increasingly rare within the thriller genre", giving the film 3.5 out of 4 stars. Olly Richards, writing for Empire, gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and summarized it as [...] "a collection of cop-movie clichés but presented with sufficient flair and strong performances that the ride is enough, even if its on rails". While New York Bilge Ebiri found the film largely unrealistic and Ayer's direction [...] "serviceable at best", he wrote that [...] "Ayer and his cast appear to have so convincingly nailed the way these characters talk and act <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> even notice the film slipping from workaday grit into out-and-out myth." ...|$|E

"And if {{you have}} reason to fear <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> act equitably towards orphans, then marry from among [...] women such as are lawful to you - [...] two, or three, or four: but {{if you have}} reason to fear <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be able to treat them with equal fairness, then [...] one - or [...] those whom you {{rightfully}} possess. This will make it more likely that you will not deviate from the right course." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{imprecision}} of {{the targeting}} {{is demonstrated by}} {{the inability of the}} Bureau to define the subjects of the programs. The Black Nationalist program, according to its supervisor, included [...] "a great number of organizations <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> today characterize as black nationalist but which were in fact primarily black." [...] Thus, the nonviolent Southern Christian Leadership Conference was labeled as a Black Nationalist-"Hate Group." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am very sorry, sir," [...] {{replied the}} critic, amiably, [...] "but {{it did not}} occur to me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> really <b>might</b> <b>not</b> wish the public to know who wrote it." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{concentration}} of related terms for similar phenomena suggests the importance in distinguishing between them. Furthermore, {{if you are}} not from the area, or <b>that</b> culture, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have experienced or know the difference between, for example, a dry heat or a humid heat, when the difference may have huge implications for the outcome of a particular action.|$|R

The first county or hunt ball, or even dinner party, {{more than half of}} them would be away. I don't say <b>that</b> <b>you</b> personally <b>might</b> <b>not</b> for some considerable time persist in patrolling the roads, for you have a sort of personal interest in the matter; but I would wager that before two months have passed you would find you were the only one who attended at the rendezvous regularly." ...|$|R
2500|$|Game Informers Matt Helgeson scored it 7.75 out of 10, {{calling it}} [...] "still the same flawed game that was {{released}} for the current-gen systems." [...] Eurogamer's Kristan Reed scored it 6 out of 10, writing [...] "the changes and improvements are so minor <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have noticed them were they not written down for you. Tellingly, {{none of them}} really address the fundamental gripes that dragged the game down in the first place." [...] He was critical of the graphics, arguing [...] "the game looks like a port from the word go. The low-poly character models, stilted animation and bland texture detail of the original is exposed even more once you see it running in high def." [...] He concluded [...] "the core of The Godfather can be quite harmlessly entertaining. Like so many openworld games, there's a moreishness to it that keeps you going even when so many alarm bells are ringing about where EA went wrong. But let's face it, The Godfather should have been far better than it is." ...|$|E

5000|$|Vibe {{magazine}} {{found that}} [...] "Talk About Our Love" [...] would aim at Norwood's core audience, stating that [...] "Brandy {{comes out of}} the gate with a bangin' Kanye West-produced single and this mid-tempo jam is sure to gain the love of many fans that might have been wary of Brandy's recent projects. Watch out Beyoncé and Ashanti - Brandy's back!" [...] BBC Music rated the song three our of five stars, and wrote: [...] "The chorus is catchy and memorable, so you'll be humming <b>that,</b> but <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> remember how the verses go ... It'll probably chart somewhere in the teens. It's a good song but does take a few listening before you get into it." ...|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Eversley {{knew nothing}} of the sacramental eating of {{the remains of the}} Kalubi, or of the final burial of his bones in the wooden coffins that we had seen, for such things, {{although}} they undoubtedly happened, were kept from her. She added, that each of the three Kalubis whom she had known, ultimately went almost mad through terror at his approaching end, especially after the preliminary roarings and the biting off of the finger. In truth uneasy lay the head that wore a crown in Pongo-land, a crown <b>that,</b> mind <b>you,</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be refused upon pain of death by torture. Personally, I can imagine nothing more terrible than the haunted existence of these poor kings whose pomp and power must terminate in such a fashion.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} asked you to dinner on the day <b>that</b> <b>you</b> came on board, Mr. Blagrove," [...] Sir Sidney said kindly, as the two midshipmen entered, [...] "but I thought <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> prefer my <b>not</b> doing so until you got your uniform. It has been some privation for myself, for I am anxious {{to hear from you}} some details as to what has been doing in Egypt, of which, of course, we know next to nothing at home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, my dear. Your {{father was}} talking to me an hour ago about it, {{and that was what}} I said; but he {{answered}} <b>that,</b> although <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> {{be able to get a}} great many clothes made, there will be plenty of time to get your things from home; and that, in some respects, it would be much more convenient for you to be married here than at Dresden. Your marriage, with one who had so lately left the service of Prussia, would hardly be a popular one with the Austrians in Dresden. So that, altogether, the plan would be convenient. We can set the milliners to work at once and, in another fortnight, get your bridal dress ready, and such things as are absolutely necessary.|$|R

6000|$|March commenced, and Charles, {{though no}} longer {{absolutely}} recumbent, {{and able to}} write letters again, could not yet attempt to use his crutches, so that all his designs vanished, except that of persuading his father to go to London to meet Guy and Markham there, and transact the business consequent on his ward's attaining his majority. He trusted much to Guy's personal influence, and said to his father, 'You know no one has seen him yet but Philip, and he would tell things to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> he <b>might</b> <b>not</b> to him.' ...|$|R

5000|$|Dirk Gently (real name Svlad Cjelli) {{operates}} a Holistic Detective Agency {{based on the}} [...] "fundamental interconnectedness of all things". To solve cases, Dirk relies on random chance methods for example [...] "Zen navigation" [...] (following people or vehicles who look like they {{know where they are}} going, in the hope <b>that</b> while <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> get to where you were originally headed, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> still end up somewhere you needed to be, even if you didn't originally know you needed to be there.) or throwing a dart at a board of words to select the direction of his detection. By following up on apparently random occurrences and whims, Dirk discovers connections between seemingly unrelated cases and often produces surprising results. He claims that he follows the principles of quantum mechanics (although it is implied when he speaks to an expert in these fields that he doesn't really understand them); most people suspect he is just a conman and he rarely gets paid by clients and is therefore in almost permanent financial difficulty.|$|R
5000|$|Galloway {{has worked}} for the Iranian state-run {{satellite}} television channel, Press TV since 2008. During an event at the London School of Economics in March 2011, he said: [...] "Because I don’t believe that the government of Iran is a dictatorship I have no problem about working for Press TV in London which is a British owned television station. I’m not responsible for the government of Ahmedinijad. I’m not responsible for the leadership of Press TV". Galloway also said: [...] "There are many things wrong with Iran. One thing they do have is elections. They elected a president <b>that</b> <b>you</b> or I <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have voted for but I am in no doubt that Ahmadinejad won the presidential election" [...] held in 2009. (See Television presenter below.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was just}} thinking," [...] he said, [...] "that you must {{consider}} {{us a great}} mystery up there at Cloomber. I dare say you have come to look upon it as a private lunatic asylum, and I can't blame you. If {{you are interested in}} the matter, I feel it is unfriendly upon my part not to satisfy your curiosity, but I have promised my father to be silent about it. And indeed if I were to tell <b>you</b> all <b>that</b> I know <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be very much the wiser after all. I would have you understand this, however--that my father is as sane as you or I, and that he has very good reasons for living the life which he does. I may add that his wish to remain secluded does not arise from any unworthy or dishonourable motives, but merely from the instinct of self-preservation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] I said. [...] "I {{could not}} help it, but I had been {{thinking}} that it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have time to wait, not on my account, but because I know your time must be precious, I have written {{it out on the}} typewriter for you." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ryan rushes {{out after}} a few mins, Bo {{was sitting on the}} stairs, Bo cries and says that she was selfish before and could they start again, Ryan agrees. Ryan said that he had wanted to tell her that the woman she saw one year ago was his sister. The movie ends when Ryan meets up with Bo at a restaurant, Ryan's sister was at another table, her boyfriend asked if Ryan was her ex and if the woman was his new girlfriend. She says no, the person with her ex is his sister, {{revealing}} Ryan was a player who had lied to both of them that the other was his sister. The final scene shows Ryan and Bo holding hands, in a voiceover Bo saying that love is all about lying and deceiving, thus showing true to the statement Bo had made {{in the beginning of the}} movie, [...] "sometimes the things <b>you</b> see <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be real and the things <b>that</b> are real <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> see".|$|R
500|$|Tatiana {{fell in love}} on {{at least}} one occasion. In an article in the December 2004 edition of the {{magazine}} Royalty Digest: A Journal of Record Peter de Malama wrote that his cousin, Dmitri Yakovlevich Malama, an officer in the Imperial Russian Cavalry, met Tatiana when he was wounded in 1914 and a romance later developed between Tatiana and the young man when he was appointed an equerry to the court of the Tsar at Tsarskoye Selo. Dmitri Malama gave Tatiana a French bulldog she named [...] "Ortipo" [...] in September 1914. [...] "Forgive me about the little dog," [...] Tatiana wrote to her mother on 30 September 1914. [...] "To say the truth, when he asked should I like to have it if he gave it to me, I at once said yes. You remember, I always wanted to have one, and only afterwards when we came home I thought <b>that</b> suddenly <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> like me having one. But I really was so pleased at the idea that I forgot about everything." [...] The dog died, but Malama gave her a replacement puppy. Tatiana took it with her to Yekaterinburg, where it died {{with the rest of the}} family. Malama paid the imperial family a visit some eighteen months after he gave Tatiana the first dog. [...] "My little Malama came for an hour yesterday evening," [...] wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on 17 March 1916. [...] "...Looks flourishing more of a man now, an adorable boy still. I must say a perfect son in law he w(ou)ld have been – why are foreign P(rin)ces not as nice!" [...] Malama was killed in August 1919 while commanding a unit of the White Russians fighting the civil war against the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine, according to Peter de Malama.|$|R
60|$|And now, moving noiselessly, Tarzan {{came within}} sight of Bara {{drinking}} at a pool where the stream that waters Kor-ul-gryf crosses an open place in the jungle. The deer was {{too far from the}} nearest tree to risk a charge, so the ape-man must depend upon the accuracy and force of his first arrow, which must drop the deer in its tracks or forfeit both deer and shaft. Far back came the right hand and the bow, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> or I <b>might</b> <b>not</b> move, bent easily beneath the muscles of the forest god. There was a singing twang and Bara, leaping high in air, collapsed upon the ground, an arrow through his heart. Tarzan dropped to earth and ran to his kill, lest the animal might even yet rise and escape; but Bara was safely dead. As Tarzan stooped to lift it to his shoulder there fell upon his ears a thunderous bellow that seemed almost at his right elbow, and as his eyes shot {{in the direction of the}} sound, there broke upon his vision such a creature as paleontologists have dreamed as having possibly existed in the dimmest vistas of Earth's infancy--a gigantic creature, vibrant with mad rage, that charged, bellowing, upon him.|$|R
