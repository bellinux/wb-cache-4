50|$|Cookin' with <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> Davis Quintet is {{an album}} {{recorded}} in 1956 by <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> Davis in Rudy Van Gelder studio in Hackensack, New Jersey. It {{is the first}} official release of his so-called First Great Quintet to fulfill his contract with the Prestige label. As the musicians {{had to pay for}} the studio time (a result of a rather modest contract with Prestige), their recordings are practically live. Two sessions 11 May 1956 and 26 October in the same year resulted in four albums—this one, Relaxin' with <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> Davis Quintet, Steamin' with <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> Davis Quintet and Workin' with <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> Davis Quintet.|$|R
5|$|Buoyed by {{his defeat}} to Guillemot, Nurmi's races became {{a series of}} {{experiments}} which he analyzed meticulously. Previously known for his blistering pace on the first few laps, Nurmi started to carry a stopwatch and spread his efforts more uniformly over the distance. He aimed to perfect his technique and tactics {{to a point where}} the performances of his rivals would be rendered meaningless. Nurmi set his first world record on the 10,000 m in Stockholm in 1921. In 1922, he broke the world records for the 2000 m, the 3000 m and the 5000 m. A year later, Nurmi added the records for the 1500 m and <b>the</b> <b>mile.</b> His feat of holding the world records for <b>the</b> <b>mile,</b> the 5000 m and the 10,000 m at the same time has not been matched by any other athlete before or since. Nurmi also tested his speed in the 800 m, winning the 1923 Finnish Championships with a new national record. After excelling in mathematics, Nurmi graduated as an engineer in 1923 and returned home to prepare for the upcoming Olympic Games.|$|E

50|$|Relaxin' with <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> Davis Quintet is {{an album}} {{recorded}} in 1956 by Miles Davis. Two sessions on 11 May 1956 and 26 October {{in the same}} year resulted in four albums—this one, Steamin' with <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> Davis Quintet, Workin' with <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> Davis Quintet and Cookin' with <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> Davis Quintet. These four albums are considered to be among the best performances in the whole hard bop subgenre. The album was remastered by Rudy Van Gelder in 2005 for Prestige Records. This album includes dialogue snippets taken from the original master reel. It also emphasizes <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> Davis' concentrated ballad-style playing with his medium-register trumpet.|$|R
5000|$|The New York Review of Books called Vertical [...] "an {{entertaining}} and touching book" [...] and [...] "laugh-out-loud funny." [...] The reviewer noted that, {{contrary to the}} usual conventions of sequels, <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> of Sideways is not <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> of Vertical, because the novel [...] "Shameless" [...] (the proxy for Sideways) is described in Vertical as fictionalized. For instance, the [...] "Martin" [...] of [...] "Shameless," [...] like <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> of Sideways, is described as being a wine expert, while <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> of Vertical is described as not a wine expert and leaning heavily on a wine reference book.|$|R

The historic Florence and Fontenelle Boulevards, as well as the modern Sorenson Parkway, are important elements in this system.|$|E
5|$|Oxford won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Middlesex station, handing the Surrey {{side of the river}} to Cambridge. At the time of the race, which {{commenced}} at 10.40am, there was a strong easterly wind. With a higher stroke rate than their opponents, the Light Blues took the lead from the start and by Craven Steps were almost clear. At <b>the</b> <b>Mile</b> Post, Oxford had cut the lead to half a length, but were forced to take evasive action to avoid a collision with river traffic.|$|E
5|$|The defunct Loma Verde Mine, {{which is}} still visible in the RMD, {{produced}} {{a small amount of}} copper and gold between 1897 and 1907. Mining of igneous rock at 149 sites in the TMD sometimes produced ores of modest value in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The most successful, the Copper King Mine (later renamed <b>the</b> <b>Mile</b> Wide Mine), yielded 34,000 tons of copper, gold, lead, zinc, and molybdenum ores, mostly during the war years of 1917, 1918, and 1941; it closed permanently in 1942 when it became unprofitable.|$|E

5|$|Three {{weeks after}} the Preakness, the Belmont Stakes {{featured}} a five-horse field. Secretariat won by 31 lengths {{with a time of}} 2:24 for <b>the</b> <b>mile</b> and a half, both course records in their own right. Through his combined victories at the Belmont Stakes, Preakness Stakes, and Kentucky Derby, Secretariat became the ninth horse to complete the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, and the first horse since Citation in 1948, ending a 25-year period without a Triple Crown winner. Secretariat's times in all three Triple Crown races were stakes records and still stand to this day.|$|E
5|$|Cabral {{became the}} 2012 NCAA steeplechase {{champion}} on June 8, 2012, winning by five seconds and capping an undefeated {{season in the}} event. Cabral is Princeton's first individual track event NCAA champion since William Bonthron's 1934 championship in <b>the</b> <b>mile</b> run in 1934. This does excludes field event champions such as Tora Harris (2002 high jump) who had been Princeton's last NCAA Outdoor Track and Field champion. When combined with the men's squash team and epeeist Jonathan Yergler, it marked the first academic year that Princeton had three national champions since 2003. Harris had also been the last track and field Olympian, although no Princeton distance runner had qualified for the Olympics since class of 1906 Princetonian John Eisele earned a silver medal in the steeplechase and a bronze medal in the three-mile at the 1908 Summer Olympics. No Princeton runner had made the Olympics since Bill Stevenson went to the 1924 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{the trail}} was rerouted through Pelly Crossing and a {{checkpoint}} was added there, and the Lake Laberge stretch {{was replaced by}} a route through Braeburn and along the Dawson-Whitehorse Overland Trail. In 1997, mushers were routed through the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project and to the Alaska town of North Pole before continuing on to Fairbanks. The North Pole loop was removed before the 2009 race, and mushers were directed through Two Rivers instead. Starting in the 2010 race, <b>the</b> <b>Mile</b> 101 location was upgraded from a dog drop to a full-fledged checkpoint. In the past several races, the Two Rivers checkpoint has changed locations annually: from a lodge to a campground, and then to a gravel pit in 2011.|$|E

5|$|In the 3000 m team race on {{the next}} day, Nurmi and Ritola again {{finished}} first and second, and Elias Katz secured the gold medal for the Finnish team by finishing fifth. Nurmi had won five gold medals in five events, but he left the Games embittered as the Finnish officials had allocated races between their star runners and prevented him from defending his title in the 10,000 m, the distance that was dearest to him. After returning to Finland, Nurmi set a 10,000 m world record that would last for almost 13 years. He now held the 1500 m, <b>the</b> <b>mile,</b> the 3000 m, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m world records simultaneously.|$|E

5|$|The decathlon was a {{relatively}} new event in modern athletics, although it {{had been part of}} American track meets since the 1880s and a version had been featured on the program of the 1904 St.Louis Olympics. The events of the new decathlon differed slightly from the American version. Both seemed appropriate for Thorpe, who was so versatile that he served as Carlisle's one-man team in several track meets. According to his obituary in The New York Times, he could run the 100-yard dash in 10seconds flat; the 220 in 21.8seconds; the 440 in 51.8seconds; the 880 in 1:57, <b>the</b> <b>mile</b> in 4:35; the 120-yard high hurdles in 15seconds; and the 220-yard low hurdles in 24seconds. He could long jump 23ft 6in and high-jump 6ft 5in. He could pole vault 11feet; put the shot 47ft 9in; throw the javelin 163feet; and throw the discus 136feet.|$|E

50|$|After {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Mingus for his newly established Debut label, and a successful gig at Café Bohemia with Rollins, Garland, Chambers, and drummer Philly Joe Jones, Davis used this line-up to record his final sessions for Prestige. It took Davis two sessions, held on 11 May and 26 October 1956, to record enough material to fulfil his contract which {{was released in}} a series of four albums: Cookin' with <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> Davis Quintet (1957), Relaxin' with <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> Davis Quintet (1958), Workin' with <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> Davis Quintet (1959), and Steamin' with <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> Davis Quintet (1961), each being instrumental in establishing Davis' quintet {{as one of the best}} on the scene.|$|R
5|$|The {{first major}} {{athletic}} event {{held at the}} stadium was the Vaux Breweries International Athletics meet in July 1961. According to its sponsors, the highlight of this meet was the team three-mile race, won by the Blackpool and Fylde Athletic club who were awarded a gold tankard as their prize. Attracted by a prize fund of £500 and the imminent AAA Championships in London, the event attracted several athletes from New Zealand, including reigning 5000m metre Olympic champion Murray Halberg and Peter Snell, the reigning 800m Olympic champion. Watched by a capacity crowd of 10,000 spectators, the men won their respective races; Halberg placed first in <b>the</b> <b>mile</b> {{with a time of}} 4:03:70 and Snell led a New Zealand one-two in the 880-yard event, finishing ahead of teammate Gary Philpott in 1:50:40.|$|E
5|$|Although Roberts {{won four}} Grand Nationals in 1976, he {{continued}} to experience mechanical misfortunes {{as well as a}} horsepower deficit to the Harley-Davidson motorcycles in <b>the</b> <b>mile</b> and half-mile dirt track events. He had been leading the Daytona 200 once again when tire troubles forced him to make a lengthy pit stop, and Johnny Cecotto {{went on to win the}} race. He dropped to third in the national championship as Jay Springsteen claimed the title for the Harley-Davidson team. He returned to England in April 1977, winning four out of six races at the 1977 Transatlantic Match races. Roberts then travelled to Italy where he raced in the Imola 200, leaving no doubt he was capable of competing at the international level by winning both legs and setting a new track record. He returned to the United States to compete in the Grand National championship where he won five of the six road races that made up the pavement portion of the series. In the road race event at Sears Point, Roberts started the race at the back of the pack and passed the entire field within four laps to win the race. Despite being in contention for much of the season, Roberts was unable to win any of the dirt track events and eventually finished the year in fourth place.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a working-class}} family, Nurmi left school at 12 {{to provide for}} his family. In 1912, he was {{inspired}} by the Olympic feats of Hannes Kolehmainen and began developing a strict training program. Nurmi started to flourish during his military service, setting national records en route to his international debut at the 1920 Summer Olympics. After a silver medal in the 5000 m, he took gold in the 10,000 m and the cross country events. In 1923, Nurmi became the first, and so far only, runner to hold the world record in <b>the</b> <b>mile,</b> the 5000 m and the 10,000 m races at the same time. He went on to set new world records for the 1500 m and the 5000 m with just an hour between the races, and take gold medals in the distances in less than two hours at the 1924 Olympics. Seemingly untouched by the Paris heat wave, Nurmi won all his races and returned home with five gold medals, but embittered, as Finnish officials had refused to enter him for the 10,000 m.|$|E
5000|$|Columbia Records {{had signed}} a {{recording}} deal with Miles Davis in 1955, but Davis still owed Prestige Records four albums in addition to Miles: <b>The</b> New <b>Miles</b> Davis Quintet, recorded in November 1955 after Davis had already started recording for Columbia. Weinstock had <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> Davis Quintet record without retakes for two full days at Van Gelder's original recording studio in Hackensack, New Jersey, one in May and one in October 1956, building up a mass of material that was ultimately used to create four separate albums titled Cookin' with <b>The</b> <b>Miles</b> Davis Quintet, Relaxin' with <b>The</b> <b>Miles</b> Davis Quintet, Workin' with <b>The</b> <b>Miles</b> Davis Quintet and Steamin' with <b>The</b> <b>Miles</b> Davis Quintet. These were released over several years, and all achieved critical success.
