5|$|In 1923, the American {{scientist}} Robert H. Goddard {{became the}} first person to develop a rocket engine <b>that</b> <b>burned</b> liquid fuel; the engine used gasoline for fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. Goddard successfully flew a small liquid-fueled rocket 56m at 97km/h on March 16, 1926 in Auburn, Massachusetts, US.|$|E
5|$|The Great Fire of New York was {{a devastating}} fire <b>that</b> <b>burned</b> {{through the night}} of September 20, 1776, and into the morning of September 21, on the West Side of what then {{constituted}} New York City {{at the southern end}} of the island of Manhattan. It broke out in the early days of the military occupation of the city by British forces during the American Revolutionary War.|$|E
5|$|The Princeton University Chapel {{is located}} on that university's main campus in Princeton, New Jersey, United States. It replaces an older chapel <b>that</b> <b>burned</b> down in 1920. Designed in 1921 by Ralph Adams Cram in his {{signature}} Collegiate Gothic style, it was built by the university between 1924 and 1928 {{at a cost of}} $2.3 million. Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered a sermon there in 1960. The chapel was rededicated in an interfaith ceremony in 2002 following a major two-year restoration.|$|E

5|$|Beginning on December29 and {{continuing}} for three days, the storm system {{associated with the}} tornado outbreak caused strong winds across the Texas Panhandle and eastern New Mexico. The winds were further enhanced by isolated showers, and gusts peaked at 79mph (127km/h) in Tatum, New Mexico. Approximately 7mi (11km) west of Levelland, Texas, the winds downed four power poles, sparking a fire <b>that</b> <b>burned</b> nearly 2,000acres (800hectares) of grassland before it was finally contained; the fire caused US$20,000in damage. In Allen, Oklahoma, strong winds associated with one supercell caused an estimated US$20,000 in damage after damaging the carport, chimney, and roof of a house. Hail and strong winds were also reported elsewhere in eastern Oklahoma and southeastern Kansas. Widespread and damaging wind gusts and hail later crossed into northwestern Arkansas, causing US$175,000in damage. Several buildings and homes were destroyed by the strong winds; similar impacts were seen in Missouri and Illinois.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was not fully rebuilt until 1911. A house was constructed {{at the site}} of the Springtown depot the year before it was rebuilt. The New York Public Service Commission, a regulatory agency founded in 1907, ruled in May 1911 that the new Springtown station was adequate. The Springtown station had no station agent or freight house. In 1925, sparks shooting off a passing train caused a fire in Springtown <b>that</b> <b>burned</b> down six buildings, causing $7,000 in damage. The prominence of the New Paltz station, as well as the growth of SUNY New Paltz in the village, caused the decline of Springtown as a community.|$|E
5|$|The {{fires in}} Yellowstone left {{a mosaic of}} areas greatly {{affected}} and others less so. Inside fire perimeters, large expanses of forest were completely untouched. There were three major types of burning. From an aesthetic viewpoint, the most destructive fires were the canopy crown fires that in many places obliterated entire forests. Crown fires accounted for about 41percent of all the area <b>that</b> <b>burned.</b> Mixed fires burned both the canopy and vegetation on the ground, or burned {{one or the other}} as they spread through the forest. Ground fires spread slowly along the ground, consuming smaller plants and dead plant material; some ground fires burned for longer duration and intensity, contributing to the loss of many trees whose canopies were never directly burned.|$|E

5|$|As part of {{the buildup}} to this feud, Hardy {{strongly}} implied that {{he was responsible for}} all of Jeff's accidents leading back to November, including an assault in a hotel stairwell that prevented Jeff from appearing at Survivor Series, an automobile accident where Jeff's car was run off the road, and a pyrotechnics malfunction where {{part of the}} pyro from Jeff's entrance was fired directly at Jeff, in an attempt to stop Jeff holding the WWE Championship. Despite Hardy's attempts to goad Jeff into fighting him, Jeff refused to fight his brother, but, on the March 3 episode of SmackDown!, Jeff viciously attacked him during a promo where Hardy implied that he was also responsible for the fire <b>that</b> <b>burned</b> down Jeff's house, {{going so far as to}} reveal that he had in his possession a dog collar that supposedly belonged to Jeff's dog, Jack (who perished in the fire), that he claimed to have salvaged from the wreckage of the house. At WrestleMania XXV, Hardy defeated Jeff in an Extreme Rules match, and in a stretcher match on the following episode of SmackDown.|$|E

25|$|Hopper's {{fascination with}} art began with {{painting}} lessons at the Nelson-Atkins Museum while {{still a child}} in Kansas City, Missouri. Early in his career, he painted and wrote poetry, though many of his works were destroyed in a 1961 fire <b>that</b> <b>burned</b> scores of homes, including his, on Stone Canyon Road in Bel Air. His painting style ranges from abstract impressionism to photorealism and often includes references to his cinematic work and to other artists.|$|E
25|$|The {{club was}} rebuilt, but never regained the {{popularity}} of its early years. Hurricane Donna in 1960 damaged most of the structures in Stiltsville, including the Quarterdeck Club, then the building was completely destroyed by a fire in 1961 <b>that</b> <b>burned</b> {{all the way to}} the pilings. The rumor was that the owner's wife set fire to the club after a jealous fit. Karl Mongelluzzo, the last owner of the Quarterdeck Club, was denied a building permit in 1967.|$|E

25|$|Long Valley {{was formed}} 760,000 {{years ago when}} a supervolcanic {{eruption}} released very hot ash that later cooled to form the Bishop tuff that is common to the area. The eruption emptied the magma chamber under the area {{to the point of}} collapse. The second phase of the eruption released pyroclastic flows <b>that</b> <b>burned</b> and buried thousands of square miles. Ash from this eruption blanketed much of the western part of what is now the United States.|$|E
25|$|In Catholic teachings, {{the object}} of the devotion to the Heart of Mary is her {{physical}} Heart <b>that</b> <b>burned</b> so intensely with love for God. Because of the inherently close relationship of Mary and Jesus in the Catholic teachings on salvation, the Heart of Mary is associated with the Heart of Jesus. The Sacred Heart is viewed as the source of God's boundless love and charity, while the devotion to the Immaculate Heart stresses the nature of Mary's love and concern for all who call upon her.|$|E

25|$|The second {{hall was}} closed for remodelling in 1935, as it was {{difficult}} for all of the audience to see the orchestra performing. It re-opened the following December. Though much of Bristol was bombed during the Battle of Britain, the Colston Hall survived most of World War II. On 5 February 1945, a discarded cigarette started a large fire <b>that</b> <b>burned</b> down the hall for a second time. The organ was destroyed, and the main auditorium was reduced to pieces of charred wood and hot metal.|$|E
25|$|This trail system {{remained}} unchanged {{for most of}} the mid-20th century, save {{for the construction of a}} new lower section of trail and a trailhead about 0.3 mile (500 m) east of the foot of the road just outside Phoenicia. When the dormant idea of the Long Path was revived in the 1960s, the trail over Tremper was included. A wayward campfire led in 1966 to a wildfire <b>that</b> <b>burned</b> 10 acres (4 ha) just below the summit. Four years later the state closed the tower.|$|E
