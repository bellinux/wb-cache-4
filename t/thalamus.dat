5|$|Neuroanatomists usually {{divide the}} {{vertebrate}} brain into six main regions: the telencephalon (cerebral hemispheres), diencephalon (<b>thalamus</b> and hypothalamus), mesencephalon (midbrain), cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata. Each {{of these areas}} has a complex internal structure. Some parts, such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar cortex, consist of layers that are folded or convoluted to fit within the available space. Other parts, such as the <b>thalamus</b> and hypothalamus, consist of clusters of many small nuclei. Thousands of distinguishable areas can be identified within the vertebrate brain based on fine distinctions of neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} {{contains the}} ventricles where the cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated. Below the corpus callosum is the septum pellucidum, a membrane {{that separates the}} lateral ventricles. Beneath the lateral ventricles is the <b>thalamus</b> and {{to the front and}} below this is the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus leads on to the pituitary gland. At the back of the <b>thalamus</b> is the brainstem.|$|E
5|$|Taste is {{generated}} from receptors {{on the tongue}} and passed along the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves into the solitary tract in the brainstem. Some taste information is also passed from the pharynx into this area via the vagus nerve. Information is then passed from here through the <b>thalamus</b> into the gustatory cortex.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{plays a role}} in pain {{processing}} {{in multiple}} levels of the central nervous system including the spinal cord, periaqueductal gray, <b>thalamus,</b> basal ganglia, and cingulate cortex. Decreased levels of dopamine have been associated with painful symptoms that frequently occur in Parkinson's disease. Abnormalities in dopaminergic neurotransmission also occur in several painful clinical conditions, including burning mouth syndrome, fibromyalgia, and restless legs syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The SCN {{projects}} {{to a set}} of areas in the hypothalamus, brainstem, and midbrain that are involved in implementing sleep-wake cycles. An important component of the system is the reticular formation, a group of neuron-clusters scattered diffusely through the core of the lower brain. Reticular neurons send signals to the <b>thalamus,</b> which in turn sends activity-level-controlling signals to every part of the cortex. Damage to the reticular formation can produce a permanent state of coma.|$|E
5|$|The basal ganglia, {{also called}} basal nuclei, are {{a set of}} {{structures}} deep within the hemispheres involved in behaviour and movement regulation. The largest component is the striatum, others are the globus pallidus, the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus. Part of the dorsal striatum, the putamen, and the globus pallidus, lie separated from the lateral ventricles and <b>thalamus</b> by the internal capsule, whereas the caudate nucleus stretches around and abuts the lateral ventricles on their outer sides.|$|E
5|$|Each sensory system {{begins with}} {{specialized}} receptor cells, such as light-receptive neurons in the retina of the eye, or vibration-sensitive neurons in the cochlea of the ear. The axons of sensory receptor cells travel into {{the spinal cord}} or brain, where they transmit their signals to a first-order sensory nucleus dedicated to one specific sensory modality. This primary sensory nucleus sends information to higher-order sensory areas that are dedicated to the same modality. Eventually, via a way-station in the <b>thalamus,</b> the signals are sent to the cerebral cortex, where they are processed to extract the relevant features, and integrated with signals coming from other sensory systems.|$|E
5|$|Olivia and Peter learn Greg {{was being}} treated for a sleep disorder, and that his dreams had {{involved}} demons until they stopped several months ago. Another hallucinating victim turns up in Seattle and dies. The Fringe team discover that both victims had a brain–computer interface chip attached to their <b>thalamus,</b> {{the part of the}} brain controlling dreams. Broyles (Lance Reddick) and Nina (Blair Brown) reveal new information leading to the sleep researcher Dr. Nayak (Ravi Kapoor) who implanted the chips. Another victim named Diana (Jovanna Huguet) hallucinates at a restaurant and kills a coworker before similarly dying of exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|The term {{limbic system}} was {{introduced}} in 1952 by Paul MacLean to describe the set of structures that line {{the edge of the}} cortex (Latin limbus meaning border): These include the hippocampus, cingulate cortex, olfactory cortex, and amygdala. Paul MacLean later suggested that the limbic structures comprise the neural basis of emotion. The hippocampus is anatomically connected to parts of the brain that are involved with emotional behavior—the septum, the hypothalamic mammillary body, and the anterior nuclear complex in the <b>thalamus,</b> and is generally accepted {{to be part of the}} limbic system.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the fourth}} week the cephalic part bends sharply forward in a cephalic flexure. This flexed part becomes the {{forebrain}} (prosencephalon); the adjoining curving part becomes the midbrain (mesencephalon) and the part caudal to the flexure becomes the hindbrain (rhombencephalon). In the fifth week of developmement five brain vesicles have formed. The forebrain separates into two vesicles an anterior telencephalon and a posterior diencephalon. The telencephalon {{gives rise to the}} cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures. The diencephalon gives rise to the <b>thalamus</b> and hypothalamus. The hindbrain also splits into two areas – the metencephalon and the mylencephalon. The metencephalon gives rise to the cerebellum and pons. The myelencephalon gives rise to the medulla oblongata. Also during the fifth week, the brain divides into repeating segments called neuromeres. These are known as rhombomeres seen in the hindbrain.|$|E
5|$|HD {{affects the}} whole brain, but certain areas are more {{vulnerable}} than others. The most prominent early effects are {{in a part of}} the basal ganglia called the neostriatum, which is composed of the caudate nucleus and putamen. Other areas affected include the substantia nigra, layers 3, 5 and 6 of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, purkinje cells in the cerebellum, lateral tuberal nuclei of the hypothalamus and parts of the <b>thalamus.</b> These areas are affected according to their structure and the types of neurons they contain, reducing in size as they lose cells. Striatal spiny neurons are the most vulnerable, particularly ones with projections towards the external globus pallidus, with interneurons and spiny cells projecting to the internal pallidum being less affected. HD also causes an abnormal increase in astrocytes and activation of the brain's immune cells, microglia.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} {{is connected}} by the brainstem to the spinal cord. The brainstem {{consists of the}} midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. The cerebellum {{is connected to the}} brainstem by pairs of tracts. Within the cerebrum is the ventricular system, consisting of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated. Underneath the cerebral cortex are several important structures, including the <b>thalamus,</b> the epithalamus, the pineal gland, the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the subthalamus; the limbic structures, including the amygdala and the hippocampus; the claustrum, the various nuclei of the basal ganglia; the basal forebrain structures, and the three circumventricular organs. The cells of the brain include neurons and supportive glial cells. There are more than 86 billion neurons in the brain, and a more or less equal number of other cells. Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons and their release of neurotransmitters in response to nerve impulses. Neurons form elaborate neural networks of neural pathways and circuits. The whole circuitry is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
5|$|The full {{profile of}} amphetamine's {{short-term}} drug effects in humans is mostly derived through increased cellular communication or neurotransmission of dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, histamine, CART peptides, endogenous opioids,C]carfentanil binding in several {{regions of the}} human brain, including the basal ganglia, frontal cortex, and <b>thalamus</b> (Colasanti et al. 2012). Oral administration of d-amphetamine, 0.5mg/kg, 3h before carfentanil injection, reduced BPND values by 2–10%. The results were confirmed in another group of subjects (Mick et al. 2014). However, Guterstam and colleagues observed no change in carfentanil binding when d-amphetamine, 0.3mg/kg, was administered intravenously directly before injection of carfentanil (Guterstam et al. 2013). It has been hypothesized that this discrepancy {{may be related to}} delayed increases in extracellular opioid peptide concentrations following amphetamine-evoked monoamine release (Colasanti et al. 2012; Mick et al. 2014).}} adrenocorticotropic hormone, corticosteroids, and glutamate, which it effects through interactions with , , , , , , and possibly other biological targets.|$|E
5|$|For vertebrates, {{the early}} stages of neural {{development}} are similar across all species. As the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of ectoderm running along the midline of the back is induced to become the neural plate, the precursor of the nervous system. The neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove, and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the neural tube, a hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center. At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. At the next stage, the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon (which will contain the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures) and the diencephalon (which will contain the <b>thalamus</b> and hypothalamus). At about the same time, the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the myelencephalon (which will contain the medulla oblongata). Each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long distances, to their final positions.|$|E
5|$|In neuroscience, a {{great deal}} of effort has gone into {{investigating}} how the perceived world of conscious awareness is constructed inside the brain. The process is generally thought to involve two primary mechanisms: (1) hierarchical processing of sensory inputs, and (2) memory. Signals arising from sensory organs are transmitted to the brain and then processed in a series of stages, which extract multiple types of information from the raw input. In the visual system, for example, sensory signals from the eyes are transmitted to the <b>thalamus</b> and then to the primary visual cortex; inside the cerebral cortex they are sent to areas that extract features such as three-dimensional structure, shape, color, and motion. Memory comes into play in at least two ways. First, it allows sensory information to be evaluated in the context of previous experience. Second, and even more importantly, working memory allows information to be integrated over time so that it can generate a stable representation of the world—Gerald Edelman expressed this point vividly by titling one of his books about consciousness The Remembered Present. In computational neuroscience, Bayesian approaches to brain function have been used to understand both the evaluation of sensory information in light of previous experience, and the integration of information over time. Bayesian models of the brain are probabilistic inference models, in which the brain takes advantage of prior knowledge to interpret uncertain sensory inputs in order to formulate a conscious percept; Bayesian models have successfully predicted many perceptual phenomena in vision and the nonvisual senses.|$|E
5|$|The cortex {{is mapped}} by {{divisions}} into about fifty different functional areas known as Brodmann's areas. These areas are distinctly different when seen under a microscope. The cortex {{is divided into}} two main functional areas – a motor cortex and a sensory cortex. The primary sensory areas receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the <b>thalamus.</b> Primary sensory areas include the visual cortex of the occipital lobe, the auditory cortex in parts of the temporal lobe and insular cortex, and the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe. The primary motor cortex, which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe, {{directly in front of the}} somatosensory area. The remaining parts of the cortex, are called the association areas. These areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex cognitive processes of perception, thought, and decision-making. The main functions of the frontal lobe are to control attention, abstract thinking, behavior, problem solving tasks, and physical reactions and personality. The occipital lobe is the smallest lobe; its main functions are visual reception, visual-spatial processing, movement, and colour recognition. There is a smaller occipital lobule in the lobe known as the cuneus. The temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories, language, and some hearing and speech.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the brain}} {{activity}} in sleep {{has been attributed to}} the <b>thalamus</b> and it appears that the <b>thalamus</b> may {{play a critical role in}} SWS. The two primary oscillations in slow wave sleep, delta and the slow oscillation, can be generated by both the <b>thalamus</b> and the cortex. However, sleep spindles can only be generated by the <b>thalamus,</b> making its role very important. The thalamic pacemaker hypothesis holds that these oscillations are generated by the <b>thalamus</b> but the synchronization of several groups of thalamic neurons firing simultaneously depends on the thalamic interaction with the cortex. The <b>thalamus</b> also plays a critical role in sleep onset when it changes from tonic to phasic mode, thus acting like a mirror for both central and decentral elements and linking distant parts of the cortex to co-ordinate their activity.|$|E
25|$|Pain-temperature {{information}} {{is sent to}} the VPL (body) and VPM (face) of the <b>thalamus</b> (the same nuclei which receive touch-position information). From the <b>thalamus,</b> pain-temperature and touch-position {{information is}} projected onto SI.|$|E
25|$|In 1909, Vogt-Mugnier {{published}} La myelocytoarchitecture du <b>thalamus</b> du cercopithèque (Myelocytoarchitecture of the <b>Thalamus</b> of the Cercopithecus), {{in which}} she reported her experiments in tracing afferent fibers to the thalamic ventral nuclear group.|$|E
25|$|The <b>thalamus</b> is also {{located near}} the hippocampus. It relays sensory {{information}} among cortical areas of the brain, mediating the responses of cells and attentional demands. During successful prospective memory tasks, PET shows that the <b>thalamus</b> is activated when intention cues are presented and acted upon. No activity is shown in conditions where participants are expecting the cues to appear. Therefore, {{it is likely that}} the <b>thalamus</b> helps to maintain intentions and execute intentions only at the appropriate time.|$|E
25|$|Pathways for touch-position and pain-temperature sensations {{from the}} face and body merge in the brainstem, and touch-position and pain-temperature sensory maps of the entire body are {{projected}} onto the <b>thalamus.</b> From the <b>thalamus,</b> touch-position and pain-temperature information is projected onto the cerebral cortex.|$|E
25|$|From the {{principal}} nucleus, secondary fibers cross the midline and ascend in the ventral trigeminothalamic tract to the contralateral <b>thalamus.</b> The ventral trigeminothalamic tract runs {{parallel to the}} medial lemniscus, which carries touch-position information {{from the rest of}} the body to the <b>thalamus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some sensory {{information}} from the teeth and jaws is sent from the principal nucleus to the ipsilateral <b>thalamus</b> via the small dorsal trigeminal tract. Touch-position {{information from the}} teeth and jaws of {{one side of the}} face is represented bilaterally in the <b>thalamus</b> and cortex.|$|E
25|$|Sensation {{has been}} defined as the {{conscious}} perception of touch-position and pain-temperature information. With the exception of smell, all sensory input (touch-position, pain-temperature, sight, taste, hearing and balance) is sent to the <b>thalamus</b> and then the cortex. The <b>thalamus</b> is anatomically subdivided into nuclei.|$|E
25|$|Touch-position {{information}} from the body {{is sent to the}} ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) of the <b>thalamus.</b> Touch-position {{information from}} the face is sent to the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) of the <b>thalamus.</b> From the VPL and VPM, information is projected to the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) in the parietal lobe.|$|E

25|$|Caffeine: Placebo-caffeinated coffee causes an {{increase}} in bilateral dopamine release in the <b>thalamus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Touch-position {{information}} from the body is carried to the <b>thalamus</b> by the medial lemniscus, and from the face by the trigeminal lemniscus (both the anterior and posterior trigeminothalamic tracts). Pain-temperature {{information from}} the body is carried to the <b>thalamus</b> by the spinothalamic tract, and from the face by the anterior division of the trigeminal lemniscus (also called the anterior trigeminothalamic tract).|$|E
25|$|The {{involvement}} of the <b>thalamus</b> {{can be found in}} sCJD, is even stronger and constant in vCJD.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} these {{multiple}} firings from multiple areas {{to be combined}} into a specific extrinsic event, there must be help from the dorsal <b>thalamus.</b> It is not proven whether the dorsal <b>thalamus</b> is the primary organizer, but it does fit the specific profile for collecting neuronal activity and rapidly coordinating between {{what is happening in}} the brain and outside of it. The space in and around the dorsal <b>thalamus,</b> the thalomocortical area, is able to generate fast voltage-dependent membrane potential oscillations which allow it to react quickly to received messages. The types of channels that cover this area are presumed to be GABAergic. Since sensory awareness needs to be quick, the threshold for sodium and potassium in this area is quite low.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} many {{contributing}} factors and risks associated with strokes, {{there are very few}} associated with Dejerine–Roussy syndrome and thalamic lesions specifically. In general, strokes damage one hemisphere of the brain, which can include the <b>thalamus.</b> The <b>thalamus</b> is generally believed to relay sensory information between a variety of subcortical areas and the cerebral cortex. It is known that sensory information from environmental stimuli travels to the <b>thalamus</b> for processing and then to the somatosensory cortex for interpretation. The final product of this communication is the ability to see, hear or feel something as interpreted by the brain. Dejerine–Roussy syndrome most often compromises tactile sensation. Therefore, the damage in the <b>thalamus</b> causes miscommunication between the afferent pathway and the cortex of the brain, changing what or how one feels. The change could be an incorrect sensation experienced, or inappropriate amplification or dulling of a sensation. Because the brain is considered plastic and each individual's brain is different, {{it is almost impossible to}} know how a sensation will be changed without brain mapping and individual consultation.|$|E
25|$|Target {{areas for}} DBS or lesions include the <b>thalamus,</b> the globus pallidus (the lesion {{technique}} being called pallidotomy), or the subthalamic nucleus.|$|E
25|$|The {{severity}} {{and frequency}} of outbursts can also be decreased by surgically disabling nuclei in the <b>thalamus,</b> the globus pallidus and the cingulate cortex.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} what causes KLS, but several {{mechanisms}} have been proposed. One possible explanation is hypothalamic or circadian dysfunction. The <b>thalamus</b> probably {{plays a role in}} the out-of-control sleeping, and patients with diencephalic–hypothalamic dysfunction caused by tumors experience symptoms similar to those of KLS patients. Specifically, the medial temporal regions of the <b>thalamus</b> may be involved, although examinations of KLS patients have not consistently found abnormalities in this area. The temporal lobe also appears {{to play a role in}} the condition, possibly causing cognitive difficulties. The apathy and disinhibition found in some KLS sufferers suggest that the condition may include frontal lobe dysfunction as well. The involvement of the <b>thalamus,</b> temporal lobe, and frontal lobe of the brain suggests that there is a multifocal, localized encephalopathy. There are also persistent subclinical abnormalities in KLS sufferers.|$|E
