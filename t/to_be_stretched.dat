The water {{levels in the}} Panuco River remained above flood stage for four weeks. In Tampico, the river flooded neighborhoods, forcing cables <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stretched</b> along roads to prevent people from being swept away. Small boats were also sent to monitor streets. According to some sources, 800people died from the floods, with thousands more being stranded in the city. Tamazunchale was inundated by an overflowing Moctezuma River. The rains caused a landslide in Colonia San Rafael, killing 12people. Heavy rains also impacted Guadalajara, which had previously not been affected by any tropical cyclones earlier in the year. In Maltarana, Jalisco, the Lerma and Duero Rivers overflowed, forcing 800people in the town to evacuate. Farther north, in Sonora, cotton crops damaged by Janet were estimated to amount to $12million in damages. Combined property damage in Mexico from Hurricanes Gladys, Hilda, and Janet was estimated to total $200million, {{nearly half of the}} government's 1955national budget. Although there were no official damage or fatality estimates, at least 1,000people were injured and another 100,000people were made homeless on the Mexican mainland due to Janet.|$|E

Once replaced by B-52s, they were flown directly from operational squadrons to Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, where the Mar-Pak Corporation handled their reclamation and destruction.

The B-36s remaining in service were supported with components scavenged from aircraft sent to Davis-Monthan.

By December 1958 only 22 B-36Js were still operational.|$|E

Large quantities of undelivered goods were in Britain or in transit when Lend-Lease terminated on 2 September 1945. Britain wished to retain some of this equipment in the immediate post war period. In 1946, the post-war Anglo-American loan further indebted Britain to the U.S. Lend-Lease items retained were sold to Britain at 10% of nominal value, giving an initial loan value of £1.075 billion for the Lend-Lease portion of the post-war loans. Payment was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stretched</b> out over 50 annual payments, starting in 1951 and with five years of deferred payments, at 2% interest.

2500|$|An {{alternative}} theory, {{also known}} as the Nystagmus Hypothesis, has been proposed based on stimulation of the vagus nerves resulting from the stretching or traction of extra-ocular muscles [...] co-occurring with eye movements caused by vestibular stimulation. [...] There are three critical aspects to the theory: first is the close linkage between activity in the vestibular system, i.e., semicircular canals and otolith organs, and a change in tonus among various of each eye's six extra-ocular muscles. [...] Thus, with the exception of voluntary eye movements, the vestibular and oculomotor systems are thoroughly linked. Second is the operation of Sherrington's Law describing reciprocal inhibition between agonist-antagonist [...] muscle pairs, and by implication the stretching of extraocular muscle that must occur whenever Sherrington's Law is made to fail, thereby causing an unrelaxed (contracted) muscle <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stretched.</b> Finally there is the critical presence of afferent output to the Vagus nerves {{as a direct result of}} eye muscle stretch or traction. Thus, 10th nerve stimulation resulting from eye muscle stretch is proposed as the cause of motion sickness. The theory explains why labyrinthine defective individuals are immune to motion sickness; why symptoms emerge when undergoing various body-head accelerations; why combinations of voluntary and reflexive eye movements may challenge the proper operation of Sherrington's Law, and why many drugs that suppress eye movements also serve to suppress motion sickness symptoms.|$|E
