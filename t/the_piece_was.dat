5|$|A 1942 piece, The Old Checkered House, 1862 was {{appraised}} at the Memphis 2004 Antiques Roadshow. It was not {{as common}} as her winter landscapes. Originally purchased in the 1940s for under $10, <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> assigned an insurance value of $60,000 by the appraiser, Alan Fausel.|$|E
5|$|A {{painting}} of the band by John Byrne was at an earlier point under consideration {{to be used as}} the album's cover. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> later used for the sleeve of the compilation album The Beatles' Ballads, released in 1980. In 2012 the original artwork was put up for auction.|$|E
5|$|Between 1867 and 1873, Fauré wrote a symphonic {{work for}} full orchestra. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> first heard in 1873 when Fauré and Saint-Saëns {{performed}} it in a two-piano version, but that transcription has not survived. Léon Boëllmann {{made a new}} transcription of the first movement in 1893.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pieces</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} made in {{wood and}} sometimes in ivory. The height of <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>is</b> varied by class. The official colors of <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> red and black.|$|R
50|$|Melodically, <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> mostly {{composed}} {{of one and}} two octave major and minor triadic arpeggios within the key of D major. The last half of <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> {{composed of}} various minor and diminished arpeggios.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> oval, [...] "O"-shaped {{with a hole}} in the middle. This {{keeps the}} amount of hook-and-loops {{approximately}} equal as <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> wider in <b>the</b> middle but with about the same number of hooks ...|$|R
5|$|In early 2013, the Recess Gallery in New York City's SoHo {{neighbourhood}} presented We Buy White Albums, {{an installation}} by artist Rutherford Chang. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> {{in the form}} of a record store in which nothing but original pressings of the LP was on display. Chang created a recording in which the sounds of one hundred copies of side one of the LP were overlaid.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the works}} {{that make up the}} Better Out Than In series were defaced, some just hours after <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> unveiled. At least one {{defacement}} was identified as done by a competing artist, OMAR NYC, who spray-painted over Banksy's red mylar balloon piece in Red Hook. OMAR NYC also defaced some of Banksy's work in May 2010.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> {{recorded}} by sopranos such as Elisabeth Schwarzkopf (from 1948), Maria Stader (1959), Elly Ameling (1970), Edith Mathis (1972), Edita Gruberova (1979), Lucia Popp (1980), Helen Donath (1983), Elizabeth Parcells (1983), Monika Frimmer (1984), Barbara Hendricks (1989), Christine Schäfer (1999), Siri Thornhill (2007).|$|E
50|$|In 2010, Acconci {{completed}} Waterfall Out & In, a {{water feature}} at the visitors' {{center of the}} Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Part of <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> indoors and part of <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> outdoors.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> 12 per player: the king, the queen, the bishop, the knight, rook and the pawn, {{incorporating}} as {{a novelty}} <b>the</b> prince (<b>piece</b> that combines movement the bishop and <b>the</b> tower). <b>The</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> colored in white, black, yellow and red.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> {{written to}} evoke {{images of the}} idyll, and does so by {{employing}} many extended string techniques, such as harmonics and glissandi. The dynamic range is wide, with rapid changes, and <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> rhythmically very complex.|$|R
5|$|The {{remaining}} six {{pieces were}} recorded at the Medinah Temple in Chicago, {{performed by the}} Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Levine. Pines of Rome was re-arranged in 1993 by Bruce Coughlin, who reduced the four-movement piece by cutting the second movement and trimming sections of {{the third and fourth}} movements. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> recorded on March 28, 1994. The second recording involved Symphony No. 5, Carnival of the Animals, and Pomp and Circumstance, on April 25, 1994. Carnival of the Animals, Finale uses two pianos played by Gail Niwa and Philip Sabransky. Pomp and Circumstance was arranged by Peter Schickele and features the Chicago Symphony Chorus and soprano soloist Kathleen Battle. The next recording took place on April 24, 1995 for Piano Concerto No. 2 with pianist Yefim Bronfman. On September 28, 1996, The Firebird was the final piece to be recorded; its session lasted for three hours. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> arranged using four sections from Stravinsky's 1919 revision of the score.|$|E
5|$|The {{sculpture}} {{was finally}} completed on August 28, 2005, and officially unveiled on May 15, 2006. The cost for <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> first estimated at $6million; this had escalated to $11.5million {{by the time}} the park opened in 2004, with the final figure standing at $23million in 2006. No public funds were involved; all funding came from donations from individuals and corporations.|$|E
5|$|The {{style of}} {{narrative}} writing, {{in this passage}} and throughout <b>the</b> <b>piece,</b> <b>was</b> alien to journalism at the time, and was considered the province of fiction writing. Only a few other authors, such as Tom Wolfe, were using such techniques in journalistic writing. The piece employed techniques like scenes, dialogue and third-person narrative that were common in fiction, but still rare in journalism.|$|E

5|$|This was {{followed}} by Gilbert's penultimate operatic parody, Robert the Devil, a burlesque of Giacomo Meyerbeer's opera, Robert le diable, {{which was part of}} a triple bill that opened the Gaiety Theatre, London, in 1868. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> Gilbert's biggest success to date, running for over 100 nights and being frequently revived and played continuously in the provinces for three years thereafter.|$|E
5|$|After {{the nine}} Études-Tableaux, Op. 39, Rachmaninoff {{composed}} several minor works in 1917. The Oriental Sketch is a fast-paced piece littered with sixteenth note figures. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> {{not intended to}} be associated with the Orient; the title was given by the publisher. The Prelude in D minor, a dark piece with thick and fast moving chords that repeatedly descend into low register, is a manifestation of his unhappiness with the October Revolution. The manuscript survived and was first published in 1973. His penultimate piano composition (only his Corelli Variations came later) was a one-page piece entitled Fragments, a brief nostalgic piece from his final days in Moscow. It was first published in the magazine, The Etude, in 1919.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, {{producer}} John Hollingshead brought Gilbert and Sullivan {{together to}} produce a Christmas entertainment, Thespis, at his Gaiety Theatre, a large West End house. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> an extravaganza in which the classical Greek gods, grown elderly, are temporarily replaced by a troupe of 19th-century actors and actresses, {{one of whom is}} the eponymous Thespis, the Greek father of the drama. Its mixture of political satire and grand opera parody mimicked Offenbach's Orpheus in the Underworld and La belle Hélène, which (in translation) then dominated the English musical stage.|$|E
5000|$|Each player {{controls}} sixteen pieces:At {{the beginning}} of <b>the</b> game, <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> arranged {{as shown in the}} diagram: for each side one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. <b>The</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> placed, one on a square, as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> {{in triple meter}} (3/8) and {{is marked}} larghetto (fairly slow) and pianissimo (very soft). <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> in bar form and its {{original}} key is E-flat major. It starts with both hands playing broken triads softly and slowly in treble clef.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> dated 5 May 1960.|$|R
5|$|In {{his early}} Munich years Busch's {{attempts}} to write libretti, which are almost forgotten today, were unsuccessful. Up to 1863 {{he worked on}} two or three major works; the third was composed by Georg Kremplsetzer. Busch's Liebestreu und Grausamkeit, a romantic opera in three acts, Hansel und Gretel and Der Vetter auf Besuch, an opera buffa of sorts, were not particularly successful. There was a dispute between Busch and Kremplsetzer during the staging of Der Vetter auf Besuch, leading to the removal of Busch's name from the production; <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> renamed Singspiel von Georg Kremplsetzer.|$|E
5|$|The Pavane (1887) was {{conceived}} and originally written as an orchestral piece. Fauré published the version for piano in 1889. In {{the form of}} an ancient dance, <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> written to be played more briskly than it has generally come to be performed in its familiar orchestral guise. The conductor Sir Adrian Boult heard Fauré play the piano version several times and noted that he took it at a tempo no slower than crochet=100. Boult commented that the composer's sprightly tempo emphasised that the Pavane was not a piece of German romanticism.|$|E
5|$|The Symphony No. 1 in C minor for {{full-scale}} orchestra {{was written}} in 1824, when Mendelssohn was aged 15. This work is experimental, showing the influences of Beethoven and Carl Maria von Weber. Mendelssohn conducted this symphony on {{his first visit to}} London in 1829, with the orchestra of the Royal Philharmonic Society. For the third movement he substituted an orchestration of the Scherzo from his Octet. In this form <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> a success, and laid the foundations of his British reputation.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> {{dedicated}} to Richard Huelsenbeck.|$|R

5|$|The Turban Head eagle, {{also known}} as the Capped Bust eagle, was a ten-dollar gold piece, or eagle, struck by the United States Mint from 1795 to 1804. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} by Robert Scot, and was the first in the eagle series, which continued until the Mint ceased striking gold coins for circulation in 1933. The common name is a misnomer; Liberty does not wear a turban but a cap, believed by some to be a pileus or Phrygian cap (Liberty cap): her hair twisting around the headgear makes it resemble a turban.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} Ravel's two operas, the one-act comedy L'heure espagnole was premiered in 1911. The {{work had been}} {{completed}} in 1907, but {{the manager of the}} Opéra-Comique, Albert Carré, repeatedly deferred its presentation. He was concerned that its plot – a bedroom farce – would be badly received by the ultra-respectable mothers and daughters who were {{an important part of the}} Opéra-Comique's audience. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> only modestly successful at its first production, and it was not until the 1920s that it became popular.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{his life}} Smetana {{returned}} to simple song-writing, with five Evening Songs (1879) to words by the poet Vítězslav Hálek. His final completed work, Our Song (1883), is the last of four settings of texts by Josef Srb-Debrnov. Despite the state of Smetana's health, this is a happy celebration of Czech song and dance. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> lost for many years, and only received its first performance after rediscovery in 1924.|$|E
