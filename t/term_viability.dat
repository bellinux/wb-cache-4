25|$|This {{incident}} {{brought about}} the interference of Imperial British East Africa Company who backed a rebellion against Mwanga II by Christian and Muslim groups. Mwanga II was eventually overthrown in 1888 {{and was replaced by}} his half brother, Kiwewa. Kiwewa himself was overthrown by the Muslim faction in the court and was replaced by his Muslim brother, Kalema. British forces forced Kalema to abdicate and restored the throne to Mwanga II who in 1894 acceded to Uganda's status as a British protectorate. These incidences guaranteed the long <b>term</b> <b>viability</b> of the Anglican church in Uganda.|$|E

25|$|Chapters that aggressively {{maintained}} their ties with alumni and faculty {{for the benefit}} of student members, and who eyed long <b>term</b> <b>viability,</b> with alumni support, encouraged early growth of their building and scholarship funds. As early as 1901, Alpha Chapter had accumulated enough capital to seek real estate investment, purchasing a suitable lot in Ann Arbor on Huron Street, near the medical school at that time. Historical records show Epsilon Chapter at the University of Minnesota similarly sought to build early in its history, choosing a site at 429 Union Street, in Minneapolis, just two blocks from the medical school. Prior to this, Epsilon Chapter rented space at the Masonic Temple at 6th and Hennepin in Minneapolis.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} third station opened, there were {{doubts about the}} long <b>term</b> <b>viability</b> of {{passenger}} rail services between Lyttelton and Christchurch. The Lyttelton road tunnel would soon become a reality, providing a much more convenient road link between Lyttelton Harbour and the Canterbury Plains. This was expected to enable the growth of road transport as a serious competitor to the railways for the custom of passengers, and concerns were expressed that given this state of affairs, a new station for Lyttelton could not be justified. Despite this, the Minister of Railways John McAlpine announced on 7 August 1962 that the Cabinet had approved a redevelopment of the railway facilities at Lyttelton.|$|E
25|$|The {{region is}} one of the most {{significant}} forestry areas in the southern North Island. The predominant soil type, yellow-brown earths, when enhanced by the use of fertilisers, is very suitable for forestry. Forestry has a long history in the Manawatu since Palmerston North developed as a saw-milling town, and the region's initial prosperity depended on heavy exploitation of native timbers. But land use practices inhibited the long <b>term</b> <b>viability</b> of this indigenous forestry industry. Severe burn-offs destroyed large areas of native forest and subsequent overgrazing affected the soils. Forestry largely disappeared until the early twentieth century. In an attempt to combat erosion problems in sandy soils the government planted forests in the Foxton/Levin area in the early twentieth century. Inland forests were planted later. Some private native forest has been set aside for sustainable logging but most forestry depends on exotic plantings.|$|E

40|$|It {{is universally}} {{recognized}} that cryopreservation impairs sperm quality. In {{order to improve}} postthawing sperm survival and motility, media of different composition and different protocols have been proposed. However, no clear evidence is available to understand which are the most efficient protocol and medium for sperm cryopreservation. The present study evaluates the efficiency of two different cryopreservation protocols and two common freezing media (FM) containing different cryoprotectants (CPs), TEST Yolk Buffer (TYB) and Sperm Freeze (SF), to preserve human sperm quality. Our data suggest that TYB is better than SF both in <b>terms</b> of postthaw <b>viability</b> and in <b>terms</b> of progressive motility, while the direct addition of FM to the sperm sample resulted in the most efficient protocol in <b>terms</b> of postthaw <b>viability</b> but {{not in terms of}} progressive motility...|$|R
