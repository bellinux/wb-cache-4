5000|$|Instead, Obama {{mentioned}} then current justices David Souter and Stephen Breyer {{as examples}} of people {{he would like to}} nominate to the Supreme Court in the future: [...] [...] [...] When I think about the kinds of judges who are needed today, {{it goes back to the}} point I was making about common sense and pragmatism as opposed to ideology.I think that Justice Souter, who was a Republican appointee, Justice Breyer, a Democratic appointee, are very sensible judges. They take a look at the facts and they try to figure out: How does the Constitution apply to these facts? They believe in fidelity to the text of the Constitution, but they also <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at what is going on around you and not just ignore real life.That, I think is the kind of justice that I’m looking for - somebody who respects the law, doesn’t think that they should be making law ... but also has a sense of what’s happening in the real world and recognizes that one of the roles of the courts is to protect people who don’t have a voice.|$|E

5000|$|Reid {{said of her}} writing: [...] "A lot {{of people}} take {{inspiration}} from it. I have a black sense of humour, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> in this situation. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> try to keep going and {{tell it like it}} is." ...|$|R

500|$|After he {{beat the}} Mariners on short (three days') rest at the {{beginning}} of August for the team lead in wins, Seattle manager Don Wakamatsu said: [...] "I thought Feldman was awfully tough. I have seen this kid, and he gets better every year. [...] I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> tip your hat." ...|$|R
30|$|I think it’s fun. Because you {{can focus}} on one project for each class. Like one whole project for each class. I don’t <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say, “Oh, great. I {{finished}} this project but now I’ve got to finish another.” So I think it’s easier to do one project for just multiple classes.|$|R
25|$|We have weekly caucus meetings. We have daily {{leadership}} meetings. We have weekly ranking Member meetings. We have party effectiveness meetings. There's a {{lot more}} communication. I believe leadership is bottom up, not top down. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> build policy and strategy and vision from the bottom up, and involve people in figuring out what that is.|$|R

5000|$|Clark {{retired from}} the city council in 2000. In a 2000 {{interview}} with the Philadelphia Inquirer, Clark explained that she felt {{it was the right}} time to retire, saying, [...] "I think elected office is like poker...I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> know when to hold them and know when to fold them. And when <b>you</b> feel <b>you</b> <b>have</b> amassed a body of work that satisfies you." ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{was very}} hard on me because I was outed and I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do it in your own time. Fifty percent of gay people {{know who they are}} by the age of 13, I was in the other 50%. I would never have married Larry if I'd known. I would never <b>have</b> done that <b>to</b> him. I was totally in love with Larry when I was 21.|$|R
5000|$|But I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a society}} like the Culture {{in order for}} people to live. The Culture is a self-consciously stable and {{long-lived}} society that wants {{to go on living}} for thousands of years. Lots of other civilizations within the same universe hit the Culture's technological level and even the actuality of the Culture's utopia, but it doesn't last very long - that's the difference.|$|R
30|$|Hannah: I {{feel like}} {{there were so many}} critics of her, {{especially}} early on. During the beginning of her campaign, people were saying ‘Oh, my goodness… she’s showing her shoulders! Her dress is so fitted!’ But she never changed. She didn’t change the way that she was dressed… she didn’t change her accessories… she didn’t change any of it. And, as a female, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> appreciate that.|$|R

5000|$|In September 2006, Clinton {{voted for}} the Secure Fence Act, authorizing the {{construction}} of 700 mi of fencing along the United States-Mexico border. In 2015 Clinton stated [...] "I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier {{to try to prevent}} illegal immigrants from coming in.

Miss Deitz has a {{temperament}} herself. And, oh, Carl, she says that 'Gertrude' isn't suited to me (and 'Gertie' certainly isn't!) and she calls me 'Eltruda.' Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that's a sweet name? Would you like to call me 'Eltruda,' sometimes?" ...|$|R
500|$|The {{album is}} also called Loose {{because it is}} [...] "the {{opposite}} of calculated" [...] and came naturally to Furtado and Timbaland; she called him her [...] "distant musical cousin because he was always pushing boundaries and always carving out his own path", which she believed she was doing with Loose. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> keep surprising people as an artist, and I like that—I love doing that", she said.|$|R
2500|$|Upon Lindros' {{retirement}} in November 2007, Clarke stated that Lindros belonged in the Hockey Hall of Fame.

2500|$|When asked a {{week later}} about the {{controversy}} about Obama's pastor that prompted, and was addressed by, Obama's speech, Clinton answered, [...] "He {{would not have been}} my pastor. You don't choose your family, but you choose what church you want to attend... hate speech [...] unacceptable in any setting... I just <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> speak out against that. <b>You</b> certainly <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do that, if not explicitly, then implicitly by getting up and moving." ...|$|R

500|$|Idol {{hoped to}} advance the way stagecraft and {{lighting}} were used at rock concerts. [...] "Part of {{the idea is to}} create an element of visible language," [...] Idol explained during an interview with the New York Times, [...] "so that you feel as if you're being talked to through images. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> start looking to get to the future of what rock-and-roll concerts should be like. We're working; we're pushing the technology to the edge." ...|$|R
500|$|Other {{major themes}} of the series include choice and free will. Meyer says that the books are {{centered}} around Bella's choice to choose her life on her own, and the Cullens' choices to abstain from killing rather than follow their temptations: [...] "I really think that's the underlying metaphor of my vampires. It doesn't matter where you're stuck in life or what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do; <b>you</b> can always choose something else.

5000|$|The former headteacher, Richard Westergreen-Thorne, has said: [...] "We {{have had}} very big {{improvements}} {{over the last}} four years and it's down to very hard work. There's no magic potion because, if there was, everyone would be taking it. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a willingness <b>to</b> do things differently.

5000|$|... "Part {{of the fun}} of this book, {{in doing}} it, was experimenting with notions of writing itself," [...] he says. [...] "And you always kind of <b>have</b> <b>to</b> worry about that. You can get generically PoMo about it, and you don't want that. But there's a very truthful voice you get from letter-writing. Not email writing, but writing-writing. And in long-form fiction, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> that - that sense of truth." [...] Coupland on {{the voice of a}} letter.|$|R

5000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be {{very careful}} about excess in television," [...] said Chamberlain. [...] "There were a lot of {{seduction}} scenes. But those are sort of the same the world over through the centuries. Then there were court scenes with people in fantastic court dress and lots of bowing and little comments and asides and fans fluttering. I wasn't particularly aware of being {{on the edge of a}} precipice, but I felt that one's concentration <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be very sharp to keep it real." ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{defeating}} Maryland, 15 - 9, in the 1979 championship final {{to preserve}} a perfect 13 - 0 season, Ciccarone said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> call this the greatest Johns Hopkins lacrosse team ever." [...] Sports Illustrated writer Joe Marshall responded, [...] "It might be easier to name the most beautiful Miss America."

5000|$|She explained, [...] "To my mind, {{the biggest}} {{difference}} is that they expect information to come to them, whether it's via the Web, email, cell phone, online chat, whatever. And given {{the tip of the}} iceberg of technology we're seeing, it's going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a big impact on how they expect to receive library services, which means librarians <b>have</b> <b>to</b> start adjusting now. I call that adjustment 'shifting' because I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> start meeting these kids' information needs in their world, not yours. The library <b>has</b> <b>to</b> become more portable or 'shifted.'" ...|$|R
