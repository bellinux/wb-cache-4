5|$|At Christmas 1085, William {{ordered the}} {{compilation}} {{of a survey}} of the landholdings held by himself and by his vassals throughout the kingdom, organised by counties. It resulted in a work now known as the Domesday Book. The listing for each county gives the holdings of each landholder, grouped by owners. The listings describe <b>the</b> <b>holding,</b> who owned the land before the Conquest, its value, what the tax assessment was, and usually the number of peasants, ploughs, and any other resources <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> had. Towns were listed separately. All the English counties south of the River Tees and River Ribble are included, and the whole work seems to have been mostly completed by 1 August 1086, when the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that William received the results and that all the chief magnates swore the Salisbury Oath, a renewal of their oaths of allegiance. William's exact motivation in ordering the survey is unclear, but it probably had several purposes, such as making a record of feudal obligations and justifying increased taxation.|$|E

50|$|The men {{who worked}} at the staithes were known as teemers and trimmers. Teemers would open the doors {{on the bottom of the}} wagons to allow the coal to fall into hoppers under the rail deck on top of the staithes, or in the case of drops, {{directly}} into <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> of <b>the</b> collier. The trimmers worked in <b>the</b> <b>hold,</b> spreading and levelling the coal with shovels and rakes so that its weight would be evenly distributed. Skilled trimmers could stand with their shovel under the stream of coal coming from a spout or the end of a conveyor and angle it so the coal would ricochet off into the part of <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> they wanted to fill. This was a dangerous job, as <b>the</b> <b>holds</b> could fill with firedamp given off by the coal, resulting in an explosion. More modern systems are designed to be able to evenly distribute the coal without the need for men working in <b>the</b> <b>holds</b> of <b>the</b> ships.|$|R

5|$|Structurally, National Westminster Bank was {{a wholly}} owned {{subsidiary}} of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group until January 2003, when {{ownership of the}} bank's entire issued ordinary share capital was transferred to The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc, as holding company.

5|$|Also in Oregon v. Mitchell, the Supreme Court {{addressed}} {{the constitutionality of}} various other provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. The Court upheld Section 202, which prohibits any state or local jurisdiction from requiring people to live in their borders for longer than 30 days before allowing them to vote in a presidential election. Additionally, the Court upheld the provision lowering the minimum voting age to 18 in federal elections, but it held that Congress exceeded its power by lowering the voting age to 18 in state elections; this precipitated the ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment the following year, which lowered the voting age in all elections to 18. The Court was deeply divided in Oregon v. Mitchell, {{and a majority of}} justices did not agree on a rationale for <b>the</b> <b>holding.</b>|$|E
