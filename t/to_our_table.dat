[...] This did not bother me much, as Indians do not eat such food. [...] At dinner-time that same day, when I sat down <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>table,</b> I saw to my surprise that there were pancakes before us. These were the ‘left-overs’ from the morning, and now the cook wanted to feed them to us. [...] Although I was very angry, I made no remark, but quietly left the table and went over where Buffalo Bill and the head officials of the show were eating dinner. Colonel Cody asked, ‘What is it, Standing Bear?’ ‘Colonel Cody,’ I replied, ‘this morning all the other races represented in the show were served with pancakes, but the Indians were not given any. [...] We do not object to that, as we do not care for them; but now the cook has put his old pancakes on our table and expects us to eat what was left over from breakfast, and it isn’t right.’ [...] Buffalo Bill’s eyes snapped, as he arose from the table. ‘Come with me, Standing Bear,’ he exclaimed. [...] We went direct to {{the manager of the}} dining-room, and the Colonel said to him, ‘Look here, sir, you are trying to feed my Indians left-over pancakes from the morning meal. [...] I want you to understand, sir, that I will not stand for such treatment. [...] My Indians are the principal feature of this show, and they are the one people I will not allow to be misused or neglected. [...] Hereafter, see to it that they get just exactly what they want at meal-time. Do you understand me, sir”’ [...] ‘Yes, sir, oh, yes, sir,’ exclaimed the embarrassed manager. [...] After that, we had no more trouble about our meals.” ...|$|E

40|$|The well-founded {{semantics}} {{has gained}} wide acceptance {{partly because it}} is a skeptical semantics. That is, the well-founded model posits as unknown atoms which are deemed true or false in other formalisms such as stable models. This skepticism makes the well-founded model not only useful in itself, but also suitable as a basis for other forms of non-monotonic reasoning. For instance, since algorithms to compute stable models are intractable, the atoms relevant tosuch algorithms can be limited to those undefined in the well-founded model. This paper presents an implementation of the well-founded semantics in the SLG-WAM of XSB. To compute the well-founded semantics, the SLG-WAM adds three operations to its tabling engine [...] negative loop detection, delay and simplification [...] which serve to detect, to break and to resolve cycles through negation that may arise in evaluating normal programs. We describe fully the addition of these operations <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>tabling</b> engine, and demonstrate the efficiency of our implementation in two ways. First, we present a theorem that bounds the need for delay to those literals which are not dynamically stratified for a fixed-order computation. Secondly, we present performance results that indicate that the overhead of delay and simplification to Prolog [...] or tabled [...] evaluations is minimal...|$|R

You {{could see}} nothing but stones and boulders, some patches of snow, and scattered pine trees. The young physician in charge was most agreeable.

I, sitting facing him, had an excellent view of the girl and her companion, and I was all the while a witness of the silent drama being played out between the two. There came a time when I felt that I could stand it no longer. I leaned over our small table, and interrupted my companion in the middle of a story.|$|E
