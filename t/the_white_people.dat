You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself.

We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E

Audre Lorde's poem [...] "Afterimages" [...] (1981) focuses on {{the perspective of a}} black woman thinking of Carolyn Bryant 24 years after the murder and trial. Bebe Moore Campbell's 1992 novel Your Blues Ain't Like Mine centers on the events of Till's death. Toni Morrison's play Dreaming Emmett (1986), is a feminist look at the roles {{of men and women in}} black society, which she was inspired to write while considering [...] "time through the eyes of one person who could come back to life and seek vengeance." [...] Emmylou Harris includes a song called [...] "My Name is Emmett Till" [...] on her 2011 album, Hard Bargain. According to scholar Christopher Metress, Till is often reconfigured in literature as a specter that haunts <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>people</b> of Mississippi, causing them to question their involvement in evil, or silence about injustice. The 2002 book Mississippi Trials, 1955 is a fictionalized account of Till's death. In 2016 artist Dana Schutz painted Open Casket, a controversial work based on photographs of Till in his coffin as well as on an account by Till's mother of seeing him after his death.|$|E

[...] However, shortly thereafter, the bank at Gore failed. The cattle herd was taken by creditors and those who had mortgaged their allotments lost their land. In the post War War I depression of the early 1920s, many sound banks and businesses failed, and the circumstances appear to have been beyond Kellogg's diligence. George Smith, fifth son of Redbird Smith, recalled, [...] "C.P. was awful smart. You couldn't get ahead of him. <b>The</b> <b>white</b> <b>people</b> was scared of him all the time, watching what he was doing with the Keetoowahs. He was a good man, but <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>people</b> were against him, and we had some bad luck." [...] After the collapse of the Lolomi Plan, some Keetoowahs believed that Cornelius cheated them and he was dismissed as spokesman for the Ketoowah Society [...] In 1925, Cornelius was raised as a chief of the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, and continued to reside in Gore, Oklahoma, and play a role with his sister in national Indian affairs.|$|E
