5|$|Clearly, some tumors {{evade the}} immune system and go on to become cancers. <b>Tumor</b> cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I {{molecules}} on their surface, thus avoiding detection by killer T cells. Some <b>tumor</b> cells also release products that inhibit the immune response; for example by secreting the cytokine TGF-β, which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes. In addition, immunological tolerance may develop against <b>tumor</b> antigens, so {{the immune system}} no longer attacks the <b>tumor</b> cells.|$|E
5|$|On microscopy, the <b>tumor</b> {{cells are}} {{typically}} described as small, round and blue, and rosette patterns (Homer Wright rosettes) may be seen. Homer Wright rosettes are <b>tumor</b> cells around the neuropil, {{not to be}} confused with pseudorosettes, which are <b>tumor</b> cells around a blood vessel. They are also distinct from the pseudorosettes of an ependymoma which consist of <b>tumor</b> cells with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)–positive processes tapering off toward a blood vessel (thus a combination of the two). A variety of immunohistochemical stains are used by pathologists to distinguish neuroblastomas from histological mimics, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, lymphoma and Wilms' <b>tumor.</b>|$|E

5|$|The main {{response}} {{of the immune system}} to tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells using killer T cells, sometimes with the assistance of helper T cells. <b>Tumor</b> antigens are presented on MHC class I molecules in a similar way to viral antigens. This allows killer T cells to recognize the <b>tumor</b> cell as abnormal. NK cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way, especially if the <b>tumor</b> cells have fewer MHC class I molecules on their surface than normal; this is a common phenomenon with tumors. Sometimes antibodies are generated against <b>tumor</b> cells allowing for their destruction by the complement system.|$|E

40|$|The eyelids are {{composed}} of four layers: skin and subcutaneous tissue including its adnexa, striated muscle, tarsus with the meibomian glands, and the palpebral conjunctiva.

Among the total number of 211 skin <b>tumors,</b> 32 types of cutaneous neoplasms were diagnosed, with epithelial and melanocytic <b>tumors</b> being the most predominant, followed by hematopoietic <b>tumors</b> and mesenchymal <b>tumors</b> of the skin and soft tissues. In our bioptic and section materials, epithelial and melanocytic skin <b>tumors</b> were the most frequent - 123 cases (58. 75 %) with four subgroups within the group <b>tumors</b> with adnexal differentiation - 66 cases (53. 23 % of all epithelial and melanocytic skin <b>tumors),</b> epidermal <b>tumors</b> - 25 cases (20. 16 % of all epithelial and melanocytic skin <b>tumors),</b> <b>tumors</b> without squamous or adnexal differentiation - 16 cases (12. 90 % of all epithelial and melanocytic skin <b>tumors)</b> and finally melanocytic <b>tumors</b> - 14 cases (11. 29 % of all epithelial and melanocytic skin <b>tumors).</b> The age of dogs with epithelial and melanocytic cutaneous <b>tumors</b> ranged between 5 months to 15 years. The fact that the number of skin <b>tumors</b> diagnosed in 1999 was doubled in 2002 is of particular importance, which may be, the result of increasingly high interest of clinicians for biopsy-based diagnosis...|$|R
5|$|Unless the {{pituitary}} {{damage is}} being {{caused by a}} <b>tumor</b> that overproduces a particular hormone, it {{is the lack of}} pituitary hormones that leads to the symptoms described above, and an excess of a particular hormone would indicate the presence of a <b>tumor.</b> The exception to this rule is prolactin: if a <b>tumor</b> compresses the pituitary stalk, a decreased blood supply means that the lactotrope cells, which produce prolactin, are not receiving dopamine and therefore produce excess prolactin. Hence, mild elevations in prolactin are attributed to stalk compression. Very high prolactin levels, though, point more strongly towards a prolactinoma (prolactin-secreting <b>tumor).</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract The nuclear DNA {{content of}} 50 ovarian <b>tumors</b> {{initially}} diagnosed as granulosa cell <b>tumors</b> {{was measured by}} flow cytometry using paraffin-embedded archival material. The follow-up period of the patients ranged from 4 months to 19 years. Thirty-eight <b>tumors</b> were diploid or near-diploid, while 5 were aneuploid. DNA profiles of 7 <b>tumors</b> could not be evaluated. All 50 <b>tumors</b> were immunohistochemically tested for expression of intermediate filament proteins vimentin and cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen. The cells of all but 3 <b>tumors</b> expressed vimentin. These 3 vimentin-negative <b>tumors</b> were positive for cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen. They were highly aneuploid and though originally diagnosed as granulosa cell <b>tumors,</b> most likely represent undifferentiated carcinomas. Hence, only 2 typical granulosa cell <b>tumors</b> were aneuploid. In addition, frozen tissue samples from 9 of 10 granulosa cell <b>tumors</b> showed a DNA diploid content. Our results indicate that granulosa cell <b>tumors</b> tend to be diploid or have only minor ploidy abnormalities which {{is in line with}} their relatively benign character.
