5000|$|IDMS-DC : A <b>teleprocessing</b> <b>system</b> {{similar to}} IBM's CICS system. When {{it was first}} released, it was {{reported}} that IBM challenged Cullinane to prove that the code had not violated copyright. This suspicion was {{due to the fact that}} many internal CICS codes begin with the initials [...] "RH". Many IDMS-DC modules also begin with [...] "RH" [...] after it two authors, Nick Rini and Don Heitzmann, both employees of Cullinane.|$|E
50|$|A {{paper tape}} reader, the IBM 2671, was {{introduced}} in 1964. It had a rated speed of 1,000 cps. There were also a paper tape reader and paper tape punch from an earlier era, available only as RPQs (Request Price Quotation). The 1054 (reader) and 1055 (punch), which were carried forward (like the 1052 console typewriter) from the IBM 1050 <b>Teleprocessing</b> <b>System.</b> All these devices operated at a maximum of 15.5 characters per second. The paper tape punch from the IBM 1080 System was also available by RPQ, but at a prohibitively expensive price.|$|E
5000|$|Between them, {{these three}} {{products}} provided much needed third-party system software support for IBM's [...] "flagship" [...] teleprocessing product CICS, which survived {{for more than}} 20 years as a strategic product without any memory protection of its own. A single [...] "rogue" [...] application program (frequently by a buffer overflow) could accidentally overwrite data almost anywhere in the address space causing [...] "down-time" [...] for the entire <b>teleprocessing</b> <b>system,</b> possibly supporting thousands of remote terminals. This was {{despite the fact that}} much of the world's banking and other commerce relied heavily on CICS for secure transaction processing between 1970 and early 1990s. The difficulty in deciding which application program caused the problem was often insurmountable and frequently the system would be restarted without spending many hours investigated very large (and initially unformatted) [...] "core dump"s requiring expert system programming support and knowledge.|$|E

40|$|Based mainly'on {{interviews}} conducted at 14 federal agencies that had completed'or {{were involved in}} software conversion projects, this publication provides guidelines for the entire process of software conversion. This is defined,as the transformation, without functional chapge, of computer programs or data elements to permit their use on a replacement or changed data processing or <b>teleprocessing</b> <b>system</b> or service. It is noted that- a conversion involving non-code-compatible machines is assumed since this situation produces the most problems. Following introductory information, six phases of the conversion,life cycle are described: project initiation; the conversion requirements phase where studies and analyses are conducted to identify agency requirements and Cott considerations; the conversion planning phase; the conversion preparation phase; the actual conversion phase; and the post-conversion phase. The objectives, activities, and managemen...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 109 - 110) The Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD) Data Dictionary System {{provides information}} about the data used by LACCD data processing programs. The Data Dictionary System serves as an online reference for data item, program, procedure, job, and data base definitions. It gives district administrators, systems analysts, applications maintenance programmers, and data base support personnel a mechanism for evaluating the impact of changes and additions to data definitions on application programs. The Dictionary is embedded in a transaction oriented <b>teleprocessing</b> <b>system</b> that offers users immediate access to individual data units, generates batch requests for printed reports, and allows interactive data entry and updating through formatted screens. The Dictionary has a menu that accesses available functions, help screens that explain each function, and messages that suggest positive actions to correct observed errors. It {{is designed to be}} user friendly and readily utilized by clerical staff as well as data processors...|$|E
50|$|Westi (Westinghouse <b>Teleprocessing</b> Interface <b>System)</b> {{was one of}} two early local {{teleprocessing}} {{packages for}} IBM's DOS/VSE environment. Westi stood for Westinghouse Terminal Interactive. Westi provided an interface and access method for programmers to 'talk' to monitors and handle data entry. Such access methods later became known as APIs and the handlers a form of transaction processing.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of {{automated}} reservations systems in the 1960s and 1970s the combination of ACP and PARS provided unprecedented scale and performance from an on-line real-time system, and for a considerable period ranked among the largest networks and systems of the era. In the early 1970s major US banks were developing major on-line <b>teleprocessing</b> applications <b>systems</b> and were in urgent need of ACP's high performance capabilities. ACP was made available by IBM to the banking industry in the mid-1970s. This system was used by the great majority of large airlines in the US and internationally; and its smaller 1970's version was used by many smaller regional airlines. PARS (and IPARS) was extremely successful, and it massively improved and revolutionized the efficiency of airlines passenger operations and their profitability.|$|R
