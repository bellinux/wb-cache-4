To get the fisherman's Chinese correct, Cohen called his friend. When the Chinese actors came, the actors felt Cantonese would be more appropriate for the fisherman than Mandarin, so it was changed. Moe was picked to rescue the children, because the writers <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny.</b>|$|E

When Baum had been touring New York State {{in the title}} role, the actor playing the ghost fell through the floorboards, and the rural audience thought {{it was part of}} the show and demanded that the actor repeat the fall, because they <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny.</b> Baum would later recount the actual story in an article, but the short story is told from the point of view of the actor playing the ghost.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the scenes}} {{were based on the}} actor's real-life talents as well as improvised. When Michael tells Pam to [...] "write this down", Jenna Fischer's {{response}} to the camera was improvised. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny</b> that I didn't have a pad of paper but Michael was telling me to take notes," [...] she explained in her MySpace blog, [...] "so I just looked to the camera and showed my lack of pen and paper." [...] Jim's impression of Stanley in this episode was inspired by John Krasinski's actual talent of doing impressions on the set.|$|E

500|$|The use of {{live action}} was a {{stepping}} stone for Pixar, as Stanton was planning to make John Carter of Mars his next project. Storyboarder Derek Thompson noted introducing live action meant that they would make {{the rest of the}} film look even more realistic. Eggleston added that if the historical humans had been animated and slightly caricaturized, the audience then {{would not have been able}} to recognize how serious their devolution was. Stanton cast Fred Willard as the historical Buy n Large CEO because [...] "e's the most friendly and insincere car salesman I could think of." [...] The CEO says [...] "stay the course", which Stanton used because he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny.</b> Industrial Light & Magic did the visual effects for these shots.|$|E
500|$|The dark, ironic {{lyrics of}} [...] "Today", {{describing}} {{a day when}} Corgan was feeling depressed and suicidal, contrast with the instrumentation. Michael Snyder of the San Francisco Chronicle said that the song is [...] "downright pretty as rock ballads go" [...] but that [...] "Corgan manages to convey the exhilaration and tragic release he seeks." [...] Corgan told Rolling Stone that [...] "I was really suicidal... I just <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny</b> to write a song that said today is the greatest day of your life because it can't get any worse." [...] Corgan later compared writing the lyrics of [...] "Today" [...] and [...] "Disarm" [...] to [...] "ripping [...] guts out."

500|$|Kreuk {{enjoyed the}} fourth season {{because it gave}} her the chance to stretch her acting {{abilities}} with Lana's storyline involving the spirit of Countess Margaret Isobel Thoreaux. According to the actress, [...] "That {{was a lot of}} fun; I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny</b> as well [...] It really was wonderful to be able to stretch and play this driven woman who has a goal and is going to reach it, and in the meantime she's going to be sexy doing it. That {{was a lot of fun}} for me because the show [...] isn't realistic so, as actors, we get to play with different types of things." [...] Kreuk says her strangest moment on the show was playing a vampire in season five's [...] "Thirst", an experience she remembers as [...] "uncomfortable" [...] due to the fake blood they covered her in. Kreuk left the series at the end of the seventh season, but appeared in five episodes in season eight as a guest star.|$|E
500|$|Ikumi created other girl–animal {{combinations}} while {{designing the}} four other Mew Mews, including a mouse girl with the same green coloring as Retasu. However, the mouse design {{was one of several}} designs rejected for use in the series as the choices were narrowed down. Once the main Mew Mew designs were finalized, Ikumi named them after various foods: Ichigo (Strawberry), Minto (Mint), Retasu (Lettuce), Bu-Ling (Pudding), and Zakuro (Pomegranate). During one of the project meetings, an unnamed editor remarked that the names might be hard to remember and suggested naming the characters after various colors instead, but the food names were kept. Although Ikumi initially suggested calling Ichigo's main attack [...] "Strawberry Bell Bell" [...] as a joke, the editorial team <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny</b> and kept the name. Ikumi noted that future attack names were decided by which sounded funniest. The only character from Ikumi's Tokyo Black Cat Girl to retain his original name and general appearance was Masha, but his gender was changed to female in Tokyo Mew Mew.|$|E
500|$|McMahan {{reflected}} on the album's success: [...] "We worked really hard on Spiderland. I mean, I definitely felt much more personal about it. I thought it represented us as people, musically, {{a lot more than}} Tweez did. That's about it. It seemed like when we were around, and actively playing and stuff, that people's responses to us were fairly ambivalent. I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny</b> when the press picked up on it. For an independent release, it had a strange sort of audience and kept selling three or four years after we recorded it; it still sells more copies than when it first came out." [...] Touch and Go founder Corey Rusk said that Spiderland is [...] "like an icon now. But when it came out, nobody cared! The band had broken up by the time the album came out, and it really didn't sell particularly well or get written about all that much in the year it was released. But it was a revolutionary, groundbreaking record, and it's one of the few instances where people catch up to it later on."

500|$|Mongrels {{was given}} mixed reviews, with some {{considering}} its quality to be inconsistent, with a reviewer for tvBite.com {{saying that the}} show was [...] "a bit hit and miss" [...] but also that, [...] "even the laugh-free moments have a well-written sheen." [...] and that the work put into the jokes show. Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror wrote: [...] "While {{most of it is}} very funny, some of the gags about Harold Shipman completely misjudge the tone.

[...] The Independents Tom Sutcliffe said that: [...] "It does have its laughs, though, because the script isn't entirely about crass shock value", but that the sitcom, while aimed at adults, is [...] "not really for grown-ups." [...] Sam Wollaston of The Guardian was mainly positive about Mongrels, but said that the main reason he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny</b> was because it depicted [...] "cuddly children's toys [...] saying things you wouldn't normally expect cuddly children's toys to say. Like 'You are such a cock-end'", and that, [...] "the novelty will wear off at some point not too far away".|$|E
500|$|The Prince-inspired [...] "Cross Dresser" [...] has a {{new wave}} style and {{whimsical}} lyrics in which the narrator holds on {{to the memory of}} his lost love by wearing her clothes. Hunt said that he did not intend for the song to have a meaning other than the explicit: [...] "I just <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny.</b> It's {{one of those things that}} people talk about, but that's never really happened to me. But I literally wrote it in 20 minutes. It felt good ... It was really quick and I just thought it was something silly and funny." [...] "It's a Mysterious Hustle" [...] features somber strings, a languid rhythm, an eerie piano vamp, and bitter singing by Hunt. It was recorded solely by Hunt, who played guitar, keyboards, and electronic drums. Its lyrics are about having to [...] "work your way through the crowd" [...] and [...] "overcome the place you come from", and view the world as [...] "no place to raise a child". Its spoken word conclusion preaches, [...] "If you follow the beaten path, it will keep you tied to the past." ...|$|E

For example, the song [...] "My Tidy Whities" [...] written by Tom Kenny and Andy Paley was released only for the album The Best Day Ever (2006). Kenny's inspiration for the song was [...] "underwear humor". Kenny said, [...] "Underwear humor is always a surefire laugh-getter with kids ...

Competing in the Lord's Taverners under-15 Cup in 2004, Colvin and fellow Brightonian Sarah Taylor were the only girls amongst the 1,000 participating teams. Colvin and Taylor's involvement in the competition caused controversy within the MCC, with president Robin Marlar calling their inclusion [...] "absolutely outrageous". He proceeded to argue that, [...] "if there's an 18-year-old who can bowl at 80mph and he's been brought up properly then he shouldn't want to hurt a lady at any cost". [...] Richard Cairns, headmaster of Brighton College, dismissed the comments as [...] "show a huge generation gap"; Colvin herself commented that [...] "we just <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny...</b> don't treat me any different.

Mets reliever Tim Byrdak would go as far to bring a live chicken into the clubhouse and named it [...] "Little Jerry Seinfeld" [...] in honor of a Seinfeld episode. The chicken was used as an unofficial mascot and was donated to an animal farm sanctuary in upstate New York a few days later. Francisco later admitted he himself raised chickens and is an expert about them. Despite the Mets winning the opener, the Yankees wound up winning the next two games, including halting Mets pitcher R.A. Dickey's scoreless inning streak of [...] innings to win the series.
