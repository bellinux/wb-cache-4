"Yes, {{they are}} local preachers. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> the upper one," [...] said Captain Dan with a smile, [...] "you were {{seated in the}} Wesleyan chapel, {{and he was in}} the pulpit dressed like a gentleman, and preaching as eloquently {{as if he had been}} educated at college and trained for the ministry." ...|$|E

What are you to do? <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> him, you had the immense {{advantage}} of taking him by surprise. Those sensitive nerves of his gave way, and he betrayed the fear that you aroused in him. Can you take him by surprise again? Not you! He is prepared for you now; and he will be on his guard. If you encounter nothing worse, you will have his cunning to deal with next. Are you his match at that? But for Lady Clarinda he would have hopelessly misled you on the subject of Mrs. Beauly." ...|$|E

5000|$|Joystiqs JC Fletcher {{described}} her in Shadow Assassins as a [...] "totally hardcore stone-cold killer" [...] and scarier than Rimikaru, but criticized Heather Hogans British accent as putting off. Gelo Gonzales of FHM ranked Ayame and Rikimaru {{as well as}} Tatsumaru from Tenchu 2 at fourth place on his 2009 list of most memorable hitmen in gaming, and Complex included Rikimaru and Ayame from Tenchu 3 among their favourite video game stealth killers, rhetorically asking in 2010: [...] "Whens <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> a male/female duo this brutally deadly?"

Others also included {{him as one of}} the best video game assassins in general. FHM placed Rikimaru fourth on their 2009 list of most memorable hitmen in gaming. Complex included Rikimaru and Ayame from Tenchu 3 on a 2010 list of their favourite stealth killers in video games, stating: [...] "When's <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> a male/female duo this brutally deadly?"

40|$|When was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> an {{isosurface}} with error bars or streamlines {{with standard}} deviations or volume visualizations with representations of confidence intervals? With few exceptions, visualization research has ignored the visual representation of errors and uncertainty for 3 D visualizations. However, {{if you look}} at peer-reviewed science and engineering journals, you will see that the majority of 2 D graphs represent error and/or uncertainty within the experimental or simulated data. Why the difference? Clearly, if it’s important to represent error and uncertainty in 2 D graphs, then it’s equally important to represent error and uncertainty in 2 D and 3 D visualization. The possible detriment caused by the failure to represent errors and uncertainties in 3 D visualization...|$|E
40|$|The {{other day}} I spotted a {{tractor-trailer}} rig with amessage {{on the side}} that caught my eye. It said,“You need it? It’s in here. ” This message has often been stated another way, “America’s needs move by truck. ” For better or for worse, these statements are no exaggeration. When was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> a Wal-Mart SuperCenter or a Home Depot or a Target or any other stadium-sized store located near a railroad track or a ship docking facility? The fact is that America’s trucking indus-try is a cornerstone of our economy and our culture. And all those trucks bringing all those goods within convenient reach of all our homes, guzzle oceans of diesel fuel that is dispensed at {{a relatively small number}} of fuel-ing facilities. In 2004, U. S. vehicles consumed 37. 3 billion gallons of diesel fuel.

40|$|Much of our {{popular culture}} and the {{institutions}} that support it honor the warrior and ignore the peacemaker. The technologies of death seem to receive disproportionate attention compared to the technologies of life. The Pentagon spends {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars annually to promote service in the military, with a good part of this total emphasizing the development and use of military technologies. When was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> an advertisement or recruiting notice promising engineers an exciting and rewarding career in promoting peaceful solutions through the application of technologies? Perhaps you happened to see a Peace Corps ad on late night TV, but probably nothing more. Military occupations, especially those involving the application of modern technologies, capture the attention of the public and give it high visibility and support. Humanitarian engineering, on the other hand, is not a well-defined concept and receives little or no attention from the public. As a result, humanitarian engineering as a career track for young professionals barely exists and is difficult to identify. Let me give you my definition of humanitarian engineering. First, take the characteristics of a typical military recruiting advertisement – professional growth, foreign travel, service to country...|$|E
