50|$|The <b>Tawny</b> <b>Daylily</b> (Hemerocallis fulva), and the sweet-scented Lemon-lily (H. lilioasphodelus; H. flava, old name) were early {{imports from}} England to 17th-century American gardens and soon escaped from gardens. The {{introduced}} <b>Tawny</b> <b>Daylily</b> is now common in many natural areas, and some {{consider it a}} wildflower. Its nonscientific names include Railroad Daylily, Roadside Daylily, Ditch Lily, Outhouse Lily, Tiger Lily, and Wash-house Lily (although {{it is not a}} true lily). Some people have planted this species near outhouses and wash houses, hence two of its nonscientific names. Hemerocallis lilioasphodelus gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E

5000|$|Hemerocallis fulva, {{the orange}} day-lily, <b>tawny</b> <b>daylily,</b> tiger daylily, fulvous daylily or ditch lily (also {{railroad}} daylily, roadside daylily, outhouse lily, and wash-house lily), is {{a species of}} daylily native to Asia. It is very widely grown as an ornamental plant in temperate climates for its showy flowers and ease of cultivation. It is not a true lily in the genus Lilium, but gets {{its name from the}} similarity of the flowers and from the fact that each flower lasts only one day. It is occasionally mistaken for the unrelated true lily known as the [...] "tiger lily", Lilium lancifolium, which is different in growth habit, floral construction and coloration.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Tawny</b> or Fulvous <b>Daylily</b> (Hemerocallis fulva) is {{invasive}} in {{some parts}} of the United States, such as in Wisconsin (Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources). People sometimes plant the Fulvous Daylily and other stoloniferous daylilies, which have underground runners. These kinds can overrun one's garden and can take an appreciable amount of time and effort to confine or remove.|$|R
