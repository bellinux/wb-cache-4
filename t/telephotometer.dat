An introductory haze discussion is included to facilitate the overall evaluation of the program. Although there is a wealth of experimental data for ground-to-ground haze measurements. there exist only fragmentary data for the air-to-ground case. The data of Waldram, and Carman and Carruthers comprise the known extent of published aerial haze studies which are statistically based on a series of programmed flight-test measurements. Even in these cases the number of flights was small. It is therefore essential to the formation of a statistical model of the atmosphere that extensive flight measurements be made over various conditions and up to altitudes of 40000 ft. The automatic haze recorder consists basically of an airborne <b>telephotometer</b> and its associated equipment: the <b>telephotometer</b> itself, an indexing mount~ a recording assembly, and a control assembly and starting box. Each of these items is described in detail. The base of the <b>telephotometer</b> consists of a device which rotates a right prism about an axis normal and concentric to one of its faces. The <b>telephotometer</b> is mounted on the floor of an aircraft in such a manner that this prism assembly extends below the bottom skin of the aircraft, and that the axis of the prism rotation is maintained parallel {{to the surface of the}} earth. The upwelling light from a 15 ° cone entering the prism is reflected along its axis of rotation and, by means of a fixed right prism into the photometric system. In this manner the rotating prism scans a path 15 ° wide, which stretches beneath the aircraft from horizon to horizon. In the photometric system the upwelling light is projected through an appropriate filter onto a photomultiplier tube. The output of this tube is read directly as the vertical deflection of an oscilloscope which is mounted in the recording assembly. The horizontal deflection of this scope is made proportional to the scanning angle by a gear-driven potentiometer. In this manner the scope makes a trace of upwelling intensity vs angle for a given set of conditions. Each scope trace, together with other pertinent data, is photographed by the recording assembly. The indexing mount rotates the <b>telephotometer,</b> and thus the scanning plane, about the vertical axis. The control assembly, once started, automatically cycles the overall system in the following manner. A blue record, then a green record, then a red record are separately photographed at the indexing mount setting (azimuth) of 0 °. Then the mount turns the instrument to an azimuth of 45 ° and the above three records are made again. This sequence is repeated at settings of 90 °, 135 °, 180 °, 135 °, 90 °, and 45 °. The head is then returned to 0 °, and the assembly is again ready for another cycle. The lapsed time of the complete cycle is somewhat less than 1 / 3 of a minute. The instrument has been constructed and successfully laboratory-tested. It has had only a single, preliminary flight test, but on this the performance equaled or exceeded the design expectations. Proposals for future flight-test programs are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Calculations of the multiple-scattered solar {{radiation}} in the earth's atmosphere are compared with <b>telephotometer</b> {{measurements of the}} sky intensity obtained during the EPA-sponsored Visibility Impairment by Sulfate Transport and Transformation in the Atmosphere experiment. The doubling and adding calculation technique, in which the reflection and transmission properties of the atmosphere are computed by initially calculating such properties for the case of very thin layers and then adding adjacent layers together, is described and compared with data for two cloudless sky conditions. The first is typical of clean tropospheric conditions, and the second represents an ultraclean atmosphere in which surface aerosol scattering is much lower than molecular scattering. Good agreement is found between the computations and the measurement data...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an invariant imbedding theory of multiple scattering phenomena contributing to errors in <b>telephotometer</b> experiments. The theory {{indicates that there}} is a simple relationship between the magnitudes of the errors introduced by successive orders of scattering and it is shown that for all optical thicknesses each order can be represented by a coefficient which depends on the field of view of the telescope and the properties of the scattering medium. The verification of the theory and the derivation of the coefficients have been accomplished by a Monte Carlo program. Both monodisperse and polydisperse systems of Mie scatterers have been treated. The results demonstrate that for a given optical thickness the coefficients increase strongly with the mean particle size particularly for the smaller fields of view...|$|E

40|$|The {{atmosphere}} of the Kathmandu valley has been investigated by measuring broad-band l ght scattering coefficient and light extinction coefficient. The values of scattering coefficients measured in winter season were found high {{in the morning and}} subsequently steadily decreasing values with a minimum in the late afternoon. This type of variation of the scattering coefficients is attributed to the increase in the mixing layer height during daytime due to strong solar insolation, which allows an increasing dilution of suspended particulate matter. The values of scattering coefficients lie in between 0. 10 ± 0. 016 km- 1, to. 78 ±. 24 km- 1, which indicate heavy pollution. Spatial variation of light extinction coefficient measured by <b>Telephotometer</b> show that visibilities have lower values in the direction of brick kilns, high population density and high traffic density. High volume air sampling of suspended particulates show that there is a distinct seasonal variation of Total Suspended Particulate (TSP) and particulate matter of 10 micron or less in diameter (PM 10) concentrations. The particulate concentrations are higher in the dry season than the rainy season. The PM 10 concentrations measured in the dry season at low traffic area lie in between 54 to 118 µg/m 3 whereas in the rainy season those were 33. 2 to 114. 1 µg/m 3. The annual mean concentrations of TSP and PM 10 measured at high traffic area were 1378. 3 ± 433. 2 µg/m 3 and 261. 4 ± 28. 5 µg/m 3. The suspended particulate matters in the Kathmandu Valley are mostly coarse particle with the diameter greater than 10 µm. In the high traffic areas these particles comprises 80 % of the TSP. This is due to resusp nsion of dust particles from the road...|$|E
