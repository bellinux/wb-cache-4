As well as incorporating the same Technic building system used in Slizer/Throwbots and RoboRiders, uses of tropical environments and characters based on classical elements were also taken.|$|E

Instead of choosing {{to withdraw from the}} world, she believes in <b>telling</b> <b>it</b> like it is. In-ha chooses to become a reporter because she believes that it might bring her closer to her mother Song Cha-ok, whom she has always idolized. Stubborn and strong-willed, In-ha believes that all news reported must be completely truthful, and goes all out in order to do so. Together with Dal-po, she unravels the truth behind a greater conspiracy, standing up to her mother in the process. Though In-ha initially treats Dal-po as family, her growing feelings towards him grow undeniable with her hiccups.|$|E
25|$|All robots {{contain some}} level of {{computer}} programming code. A program is how a robot decides when or how to do something. In the caterpillar track example, a robot that needs to move across a muddy road may have the correct mechanical construction and receive the correct amount of power from its battery, but would not go anywhere without a program <b>telling</b> <b>it</b> to move. Programs are the core essence of a robot, it could have excellent mechanical and electrical construction, but if its program is poorly constructed its performance will be very poor (or it may not perform at all). There are three different types of robotic programs: remote control, artificial intelligence and hybrid. A robot with remote control programing has a preexisting set of commands that it will only perform if and when it receives a signal from a control source, typically a human being with a remote control. It is perhaps more appropriate to view devices controlled primarily by human commands as falling in the discipline of automation rather than robotics. Robots that use artificial intelligence interact with their environment on their own without a control source, and can determine reactions to objects and problems they encounter using their preexisting programming. Hybrid {{is a form of}} programming that incorporates both AI and RC functions.|$|E

[...] The annual holiday fell {{on the final day of}} school summer vacation, which made it popular among schoolchildren. It is uncertain how much Wilhelmina enjoyed the festivities; although writer Mike Peek, in a 2011 magazine article about Koninginnedag, suggests she was enthusiastic, there is a story of Wilhelmina, after a tired return from one of these birthday processions, making her doll bow until the toy's hair was dishevelled, and <b>telling</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "Now you shall sit in a carriage and bow until your back aches, and see how much you like being a Queen!" ...|$|E

This show continues to operate on a level few other series could dream of...". Roger Friedman of Forbes called the LSD sequences with Jane and Roger to be [...] "so well-written {{they were kind of}} transcendent". Salon writer Nellie Engoron acclaimed the episode, while pointing out that [...] "with this episode’s tilt of the seesaw back to the older generation from the flailing youngsters, we’re reminded that while the 1960s saw a cultural shift towards youth, like a drunk, no historical change walks a straight line. For all the claims that Don and others have made that the “kids” increasingly hold the cards, the real truth (if we’re <b>telling</b> <b>it)</b> is that older white guys like Bert and Roger never truly lost power, even if they began to hide behind the scenes while fresh young faces took the public glory." ...|$|E
500|$|In a May 7, 1918 {{letter from}} Tobolsk {{to her sister}} Maria in Yekaterinburg, Anastasia {{described}} a moment of joy despite her sadness and loneliness and worry for the sick Alexei: [...] "We played on the swing, that was when I roared with laughter, the fall was so wonderful! Indeed! I told the sisters about {{it so many times}} yesterday that they got quite fed up, but I could go on <b>telling</b> <b>it</b> masses of times... What weather we've had! One could simply shout with joy." [...] In his memoirs, one of the guards at the Ipatiev House, Alexander Strekotin, remembered Anastasia as [...] "very friendly and full of fun", while another guard said Anastasia was [...] "a very charming devil! She was mischievous and, I think, rarely tired. She was lively, and was fond of performing comic mimes with the dogs, as though they were performing in a circus." [...] Yet another of the guards, however, called the youngest grand duchess [...] "offensive and a terrorist" [...] and complained that her occasionally provocative comments sometimes caused tension in the ranks. Anastasia and her sisters helped their maid darn stockings and assisted the cook in making bread and other kitchen chores while they were in captivity at the Ipatiev House.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{generally}} well received by critics, with several {{commenting on the}} honesty of the work. Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Life offers much more than vicarious thrills. It captures the true spirit of rock and roll, the nitty-gritty {{of life on the}} road, and just {{what it feels like to}} be a heroin addict who doesn't know where his next fix is coming from. It also movingly captures Richards' extraordinary love of music—an even more powerful addiction for him than smack—and perhaps more surprisingly, his manifest destiny as a human being." [...] Jim Fusilli of the Wall Street Journal said that [...] "Mr. Richards writes with disarming introspection about his childhood, family and fame. And it's quite likely that no rock musician has ever written so keenly about the joys of making music. With a warm sense of humor and willingness to share his grief, Mr. Richards in [...] "Life" [...] defies almost every public perception about him." [...] In The Independent, John Walsh commented, [...] "He tells it with complete, reckless, disclosure. Sometimes it sounds like a man ranting into a tape machine; sometimes, in the tidier and more reflective sections, you can detect the hand of his co-writer, James (White Mischief) Fox. But the watchwords of this book are honesty, confessionalism, <b>telling</b> <b>it</b> straight." ...|$|E

500|$|... "I Want You" [...] is a pop ballad {{based on}} {{music of the}} Motown era. It {{incorporates}} doo-wop, R and hip-hop into its production, providing an [...] "equally keen senses of retroism and hip-hop currency." [...] Its instrumentation consists of guitar, piano, violins, and synthesized drums. It has a slow tempo of 72 beats per minute, with Jackson's vocals ranging from G3 to C5. It contains a brief sample from B. T. Express' 1976 version of The Carpenters' 1970 song [...] "(They Long to Be) Close to You", written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David. Jackson described the song as having a [...] "throwback" [...] feel, considered a departure from her other works. Michael Paletta of Billboard described its [...] "opening drum downbeat" [...] accompanied by [...] "swirling string crescendos," [...] considered [...] "the perfect backdrop for Jackson's breathy vocals." [...] It was analyzed to have a [...] "chimes-studded texture" [...] and strings backed by drums, also having [...] "a triangle thrown in there for good measure." [...] Its lyrics focus on longing for an estranged lover and feeling emotionally distraught when apart. Jackson pleads for their affection during its chorus, telling them to [...] "Have your way with me." [...] Tareck Ghoneim of Contactmusic.com stated [...] "The lyrics are simple. She just wants her man and she’s <b>telling</b> <b>it</b> straight," [...] while Plugged In observed it to convey Jackson's [...] "insatiable" [...] desire for intimacy in a [...] "vulnerable and lovesick" [...] manner.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, seven-year-old Amelia Pond (Caitlin Blackwood) finds {{instructions}} from the Doctor leading her to the National Museum, where the Pandorica is on display. She touches the box, allowing it to revitalise Amy and release her. They are soon joined by the Doctor and Rory, now a museum guard who secretly survived the Blitz. After a tearful reunion, they are chased by a Dalek restored {{by the light of}} the Pandorica. The Doctor uses the vortex manipulator to go back and give Rory his screwdriver, as well as leave Amelia the clues to the museum. Amelia soon disappears: a sign, according to the Doctor, that the universe is collapsing rapidly. The injured body of a future version of the Doctor appears and whispers something to his earlier self. The Doctor takes off with Amy and Rory to the roof of the museum, where he discovers that the [...] "sun" [...] is the still-exploding TARDIS. Rory hears a voice coming from the exploding TARDIS and the Doctor amplifies the voice and discovers it is River Song in a time-loop, implemented by the TARDIS to keep her alive. The Doctor saves River, and as the quartet reunites, the Doctor is shot by the Dalek and sends himself backwards in time. Amy and Rory depart while River threatens the Dalek, <b>telling</b> <b>it</b> to look her up in its data records. Upon doing so, the Dalek begins to shake in terror and plead for mercy before River kills it.|$|E
500|$|Wiesenthal wrote {{a number}} of books, some of which contain {{conflicting}} stories and tales, {{many of which were}} invented. Several authors, including Segev and British author Guy Walters, feel that Wiesenthal's autobiographies are not reliable sources of information about his life and activities. For example, Wiesenthal would describe two people fighting over one of the lists he had prepared of survivors of the Holocaust; the two look up and recognise each other and have a tearful reunion. In one account it is a man and wife, and in another <b>telling</b> <b>it</b> is two brothers. Wiesenthal's memoirs variously claim he had spent time in as many as eleven concentration camps; the actual number was five. A drawing he made in 1945 that he claimed was a scene he witnessed in Mauthausen had actually been sketched from photos that appeared in Life magazine that June. He particularly over-emphasised his role in the capture of Eichmann, claiming that he prevented Veronika Eichmann from having her husband declared dead in 1947, when in fact the declaration was denied [...] "at the instigation of the authorities." [...] Wiesenthal said that he had retained his Eichmann file when he sent his research materials to Yad Vashem in 1952; in fact he sent all his materials there, and it was his counterpart, Tuviah Friedman in Vienna, who had retained materials on Eichmann. Isser Harel, director of the Mossad at the time, has stated that Wiesenthal had no role in the capture of Eichmann.|$|E

2500|$|Behn was a {{political}} writer of fiction and for the stage, and though not didactic in purpose, most of her works have distinct political content. The timing of Oroonokos publication must be seen in its own context {{as well as in}} the larger literary tradition (see below). According to Charles Gildon, Aphra Behn wrote Oroonoko even with company present, and Behn's own account suggests that she wrote the novel in a single sitting, with her pen scarcely rising from the paper. If Behn travelled to Surinam in 1663–64, she felt no need for twenty-four years to write her [...] "American story" [...] and then felt a sudden and acute passion for <b>telling</b> <b>it</b> in 1688.
