60|$|The men set to work, and {{the boys}} helped <b>to</b> <b>stow</b> the <b>sail</b> and fasten it with the tiers. Suddenly there was a sharp puff of wind. It lasted a few seconds only, then Joe Chambers pointed towards the spot whence a hazy light seemed to come.|$|R
5000|$|In sailing, gaskets are {{lengths of}} rope or fabric used <b>to</b> hold a <b>stowed</b> <b>sail</b> in place. In modern use, {{the term is}} usually {{restricted}} to square-rigged ships, the equivalent items on yachts being referred to by the more prosaic [...] "sail ties".|$|R

5000|$|Ratlines, {{pronounced}} [...] "rattlin's", are {{lengths of}} thin line tied between the shrouds of a sailing ship {{to form a}} ladder. Found on all square rigged ships, whose crews must go aloft <b>to</b> <b>stow</b> the square <b>sails,</b> they also appear on larger fore-and-aft rigged vessels to aid in repairs aloft or conduct a lookout from above.|$|R
5000|$|Clewlines and buntlines are lines used {{to handle}} the sails of a square rigged ship.Although the common {{perception}} of a traditionally rigged ship is that the sails are handled from [...] "up in the rigging", {{the majority of the}} work is actually carried out from the deck. In particular, when sailors go aloft <b>to</b> <b>stow</b> the square <b>sails</b> by bundling them up and tying them to the yard (with gaskets) they don't have to pull the whole weight of the sail up towards them. That work has already been carried out from the deck using the clewlines and the buntlines.|$|R
60|$|Every eye on deck {{was fixed}} on the four seamen as, rapidly but steadily, they {{proceeded}} <b>to</b> furl and <b>stow</b> the <b>sail.</b> There was still not a breath of wind, but a low humming noise was heard.|$|R

50|$|A {{slippery}} hitch is a knot used {{to attach}} a line to a rod or bar. It does not provide great strength compared to some other knots, {{but it can be}} tied relatively quickly and released very easily. These characteristics mean that it is used on square-rigged ships for securing the gaskets that bind <b>stowed</b> <b>sails</b> <b>to</b> the yards.|$|R
50|$|Each yard on {{a square}} or gaff rigged sailing ship is {{equipped}} with a footrope for sailors to stand on while setting or <b>stowing</b> the <b>sails.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Slippery hitch and Buntline hitch are {{essentially}} a slipped Clove hitch around the main part. Slippery hitch has the slip {{placed under the}} last {{turn away from the}} main part, while Buntline hitch has the slip placed under the last turn towards the main part. Easy to tie, secure, easy to untie, Slippery hitch is used several in a row on square-rigged ships for securing the gaskets that bind <b>stowed</b> <b>sails</b> <b>to</b> the yards on top, while Buntline hitch, stronger but more difficult to untie, is used slipped to secure the bottom of open sail.|$|R

25|$|When transiting a surf line, or {{in other}} rough sea conditions, the {{movement}} of the boat can cause poorly secured equipment to move, which can directly injure the occupants, and adversely affect trim and stability, and thereby the safety of the vessel and its occupants. Dedicated dive boats usually provide cylinder racks <b>to</b> <b>stow</b> the scuba sets, and may also provide bins or racks <b>to</b> <b>stow</b> other heavy equipment. Larger vessels, particularly live-aboards, may also provide a camera table and fresh water rinsing facilities for washing gear after the dive.|$|R
