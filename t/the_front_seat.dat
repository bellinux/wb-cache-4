5|$|The Cheyenne had a two-seat tandem cockpit {{featuring}} {{an advanced}} navigation and fire control suite. The tandem seating placed the {{pilot in the}} rear seat, and the gunner in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat.</b> An unusual feature of the gunner's station was that the entire seat, sighting system, and firing controls rotated to keep the gunner facing {{the same direction as}} the gun turret being controlled. The gun-sight afforded the gunner direct viewing from the turret by way of a periscope sight. The pilot had a helmet mounted sight system for aiming weapons.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 8 {{minutes after}} the DC-7 had {{departed}} Los Angeles, a U.S. Air Force F-100F-5-NA Super Sabre jet fighter, serial number 56-3755, took off from Nellis Air Force Base near Las Vegas at 7:45a.m. on a training flight with two pilots on board. In <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> of the tandem cockpit was flight instructor and safety pilot Capt. Thomas N. Coryell, 29, and behind him sat his student, 1st Lt. Gerald D. Moran, 24, who {{as part of his}} training would spend the flight under a hood that blocked his view outside the aircraft, but allowed him to see his instrument panel.|$|E
5|$|It is Christmas, and Christine {{is having}} dinner with Marion, Ernie, Fung, Bobby and Adam. Christine unwraps her present to find an album of photos from her life. She says that she feels as if her life is {{flashing}} before her eyes, and then realises what is happening. Christine sits {{in a car wreck}} as emergency services attempt to free her. On <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> & window screen, there are broken eggs from a shopping bag and the Stranger is explaining to the police that he stepped into the road causing the crash, and, though he could free Jack he could not reach Christine. At the dinner table, Jack enters dressed as a Nativity angel. Marion says it is time for Christine to move on. Christine says a final goodbye.|$|E
50|$|Soft tops with glass, {{plastic or}} {{flexible}} vinyl windows are used. The common off-road soft top types are: full soft top (covers the interior, doors, and includes windows), halftops (cover the space above <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats,</b> doors with windows, backdrop behind <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats</b> and stretch over the rear seats and cargo area), bikini tops (cover the roof area above {{the interior and}} cargo compartment, or just the space above <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats).</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 265 fibers {{from the}} family car’s rear seat covers were found on Melanie's panties and {{the inside of her}} trousers, but {{only a small number of}} fibers from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats</b> was found on the children.

5|$|In 1967, Mansfield was in Biloxi, Mississippi, for an {{engagement}} at the Gus Stevens Supper Club. After two appearances {{the evening of}} June 28, Mansfield, Sam Brody (her attorney and companion), their driver Ronnie Harrison (age 20), and three of Mansfield's children– Miklós, Zoltán and Mariska– departed Biloxi after midnight in a 1966 Buick Electra 225. Their destination was New Orleans, where Mansfield was scheduled to appear on WDSU's Midday Show at noon the next day. At approximately 2:25a.m., on U.S. Highway 90 west of the Rigolets Bridge, the Buick crashed at high speed into the rear of a tractor-trailer that had slowed behind a truck spraying mosquito fogger and that was shrouded in the insecticide fog. The three adults in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> were killed instantly. The children, who were asleep in the rear seat, survived with minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|Everywhere Hitler went, he was {{accompanied}} by men of the FBK. They worked in three shifts, providing close protection of Hitler. Before a trip or important public event, the RSD checked the route, the buildings along it, and the places which Hitler was to visit. The local Gestapo office provided intelligence reports, along with information as to any assassination rumours, to the RSD. Orpo police officers were called in as necessary to help with security. As far as possible, the streets or approaches to a building were lined with uniformed SS men, with every third man facing the crowd. At the same time, plainclothes SS men or Kripo police officers mingled with the crowd of spectators. Hitler's motorcade was preceded by a pilot car. Hitler's car, usually an open Mercedes-Benz, followed 50metres behind. Hitler always stood or sat in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat,</b> beside the driver, with a FBK member and an adjutant behind him. Following his car were two cars {{to the left and}} right, one {{with the rest of the}} FBK and the other with a detachment of RSD men. Then came the car of other Nazi chieftains and/or SS leaders; after a further 100-metre gap came the car or cars with any additional guests.|$|E
25|$|Cockpit {{accommodation}} {{is provided}} for the pilot in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> and two passengers in the rear seat, side-by-side. Unlike the J-3 Cub the PA-12 is flown solo from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{backs of}} <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats</b> were recessed, {{improving}} rear seat leg room.|$|R

The pyrotechnic pretensioners for <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats</b> (depending on version) complete Dacia Duster's retention system.|$|R
25|$|Also {{sitting in}} <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> {{in the middle}} between the driver (left) and Tan (right) was TV {{journalist}} Khairulanuar Yahaya. He has so far said that he cannot believe his fellow worker at Bernama TV was killed.|$|E
25|$|Changes to the North American-built Cruze for {{model year}} 2012 include the {{availability}} of the six-speed manual transmission for the 1.4-litre turbocharged engine, plus models not equipped with power front seats no longer have <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> cushion tilt option.|$|E
25|$|Toyota {{improved}} the Camry's safety {{by increasing the}} XV40's structural rigidity. This has been achieved {{through the application of}} ultra high-tensile steel, which is hot-stamped to the Camry's roof, A- and B-pillars, and rocker panels. The structure of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> mounts were designed to transfer side collision impact loads across the car.|$|E

25|$|The O-2 is a parasol wing, {{conventional}} landing gear, strut-braced, tandem-seat, open cockpit, sport aircraft. The fuselage {{is constructed}} of welded steel tubing with an aluminum turtledeck and belly covers, covered with fabric. The wing uses wooden spars and ribs with the fuel tanks the wing roots. A small door provided access to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
25|$|The key {{evidence}} supporting this allegation was the jumpsuit, {{as well as}} a highly contentious forensic report claiming to have found evidence of foetal haemoglobin in stains on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> of the Chamberlains' 1977 Torana hatchback. Foetal haemoglobin is present in infants six months and younger; Azaria was nine weeks old {{at the time of her}} disappearance.|$|E
25|$|A curiosity of the J-3 is {{that when}} it is flown solo, the lone pilot {{normally}} occupies the rear seat for proper balance, to balance the fuel tank located at the firewall. Starting with the PA-11, {{as well as some}} L-4s, fuel was carried in wing tanks, allowing the pilot to fly solo from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
50|$|Combined with <b>the</b> rear <b>seats,</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats</b> swivel 180 degrees, so you {{can have}} a meeting/meal/break with the rear seat passengers.|$|R

25|$|Rufus Youngblood {{was riding}} in the vice-presidential car. When the shots were fired, he vaulted over <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> and threw his body over Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. That evening, Johnson called Secret Service Chief James J. Rowley and cited Youngblood's bravery. Youngblood would later recall some of this in his memoir, Twenty Years in the Secret Service.|$|E
25|$|Teague's {{low-drag}} design, which predated {{the fuel}} {{crisis and the}} flood of small foreign imports into the American market, was highly innovative. Its drag coefficient of 0.43 was relatively low for that time. Teague even eliminated rain gutters, smoothly blending {{the tops of the}} doors into the roof—an aerodynamic detail that, although criticized at the time for allowing rain onto <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat,</b> has become the norm in today's designs.|$|E
25|$|Suspect {{transport}} enclosures: These are {{steel and}} plastic barriers which {{ensure that a}} suspect—who has been frisked, disarmed, handcuffed and seat belted, is unable to attack the driver or passenger and unable to tamper with equipment in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat.</b> These may be simple bars or grilles, although they can include highly impact resistant but not bullet resistant glass. Many use expanded steel instead of plastic glazing for {{the upper half of}} the partition.|$|E

25|$|In 1988, the Electra Park Avenue {{received}} {{what would}} later {{go on to}} become GM's flagship engine, the 3800 V-6. The original 3.8L V-6 was still offered in some Electra models through the 1988 model year and was designated by the VIN code 3, while Electras with the 3800 V-6 were designated by the VIN code C. For 1989, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> belts became door-mounted, and back seat shoulder belts became standard.|$|E
25|$|As with {{conventional}} biplane floatplanes, the torpedo was carried between {{the bottom of}} the fuselage and the floats. Unusually, the aircraft was flown from the rear cockpit, although this did cause a problem for an observer in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat.</b> The observer had to stand on the coaming to use the machine-gun, which was level with the top wing. When a torpedo was carried, the aircraft could not fly with an observer at the same time.|$|E
25|$|The second {{incident}} of 2004 {{was on one}} of Intamin's mega coasters, Superman: Ride of Steel at Six Flags New England in Massachusetts. The ride, again with lap bar restraints, was dispatched with a cerebral palsy sufferer in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat,</b> who died after being ejected from his seat. According to an investigation, the ride operators were primarily to blame for not ensuring the rider was properly secured. Intamin was also partially blamed because the ride's safety system allowed the train to be dispatched without all the restraints properly secured.|$|E
