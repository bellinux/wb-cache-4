5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>DR</b> had been extended to Richmond, Ealing Broadway, Hounslow West and Wimbledon in the west and to New Cross Gate in the east. The southern section of the Inner Circle was suffering considerable congestion between South Kensington and Mansion House, between which stations <b>the</b> <b>DR</b> was running an average of 20 trains per hour with more in the peak periods.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{purchase}} of <b>the</b> <b>DR</b> by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London in 1902, the planned DR and B lines were merged with a third proposed route from the Great Northern and Strand Railway. <b>The</b> <b>DR</b> deep-level route was revised at its western end to continue to Earl's Court and surface {{to the east of}} Barons Court.|$|E
5|$|From the beginning, {{the company}} {{encountered}} delays in implementing its plans. Neither {{of the two}} main line railway companies were interested in investing in the line, so the W's promoters approached <b>the</b> <b>DR</b> for assistance. In 1911, Albert Stanley, managing director of <b>the</b> <b>DR,</b> agreed that it would finance the construction, if the promoters would guarantee a return of £6,000 per year for ten years. <b>The</b> <b>DR</b> was to cover any shortfall below 4.5 per cent return on capital. To provide additional capacity for Sutton trains on the DR's Wimbledon branch, <b>the</b> <b>DR</b> published a bill on 21 November 1911 seeking permission to construct additional tracks on the L owned section from Wimbledon to East Putney. The works were approved by the Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1912, which received assent on 7 August 1912. The L was to build the additional tracks with <b>the</b> <b>DR</b> covering the cost.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWith the {{decoupling}} elasticity model, {{this paper}} studies <b>the</b> decoupling relationships (<b>DRs)</b> of total water uses (TWU) and provincial GDP, agricultural water uses (AWU) and agricultural added value (AAV), {{as well as}} industrial water uses (IWU) and industrial added value (IAV) respectively in Yunnan and Guizhou during the first ten years {{for the implementation of}} the Great Western Development Strategy. The results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>DRs</b> of water uses and economic development are highly undesirable in both provinces. Among the three groups, <b>the</b> <b>DRs</b> of AWU and AAV are the worst of all, with strong or weak coupling in 5 of the 10 years; <b>the</b> <b>DRs</b> of IWU and IAV are slightly better with strong coupling respectively in 3 of the 10 years in Yunnan and in 2 of the 10 years in Guizhou; and <b>the</b> <b>DRs</b> of TWU and GDP are the best, with strong or weak decoupling in 7 of the 10 years in both provinces. <b>The</b> <b>DRs</b> have improved in the period of 2006 - 2010 if compared with that in the period of 2001 - 2005. It is concluded that slow economic growth, low efficiency and poor structure of water uses are the main reasons for the worse status of <b>DRs,</b> and <b>the</b> development of economy and water uses efficiency promotes <b>the</b> <b>DRs</b> getting better...|$|R
5|$|On 1 August 1870, <b>the</b> <b>DR</b> opened {{additional}} tracks between Gloucester Road and South Kensington.

5|$|Also {{announced}} in November 1896 was {{a bill to}} be presented by the District Railway (DR) for a tube railway to be constructed beneath its existing sub-surface line between Gloucester Road and Mansion House stations. <b>The</b> <b>DR</b> operated a steam railway, running in cut and cover tunnels, and planned to ease congestion along its heavily used route by constructing an express line with just a single intermediate station at Charing Cross (now Embankment). The express line was to surface west of Gloucester Road and connect to the DR's existing line at Earl's Court. Since, like the B, the DR's deep tube line would be operated with electric trains, <b>the</b> <b>DR</b> planned to build a generating station adjacent to its Walham Green station (now Fulham Broadway). The bill received assent on 6 August 1897 as the Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1897.|$|E

5|$|At Wardour Street {{station a}} branch {{was to leave}} the main route and head south-east, to connect to the DR's deep-level line east of its station at Charing Cross. Wardour Street station was planned to have {{platforms}} on both branches. The south-west extension to Walham Green was retained with minor alterations. The new route was to branch from the original route east of Brompton Road station, which was to have platforms on both routes. Stations were planned along Fulham Road at its junctions with College Street (now Elystan Street), Neville Street, Drayton Gardens, Redcliffe Gardens, Stamford Bridge and Maxwell Road. The route would interchange with <b>the</b> <b>DR</b> at Walham Green {{before coming to the}} surface and running parallel with <b>the</b> <b>DR</b> as far as Parsons Green, beyond which the line was to connect to <b>the</b> <b>DR.</b> The requests for an extension of time and for the powers to build <b>the</b> <b>DR</b> deep-level line from South Kensington to Earl's Court were re-presented. As the B and the GN were now in common ownership, the bill also sought powers to enable the companies to merge and for the B to change its name.|$|E

At 24 hr later under these apoptotic stimuli, the sub G 1 fraction of hepatocytes isolated from <b>the</b> <b>drs</b> KO mice was significantly decreased {{in comparison to}} wild C 57 BL/ 6 mice. In contrast, sequential time-lapse microscopic analysis revealed clearer and larger differences in the apoptotic responses of primary hepatocytes from <b>the</b> <b>drs</b> KO and wild-type mice from 4 hr to 24 hr after apoptotic induction. The time-lapse microscopic analysis clearly indicated the hepatocytes isolated from <b>the</b> <b>drs</b> KO mouse to be more resistant to the apoptotic stimuli than other methods.
