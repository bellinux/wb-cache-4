5|$|Around Storybrooke, {{residents}} {{notice the}} clock tower's hands moving. Regina (Lana Parrilla) {{looks through the}} book of fairy tales and discovers that the last few pages are <b>torn</b> <b>out.</b> She confronts Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), who lies and says that the pages are missing {{because it is an}} old book. Regina learns Emma is still in town when the clock's hands move forward. Believing that Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) will try to take Henry away from her, Regina encourages Emma to leave town. Regina meets with The Daily Mirror editor, Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito), who has run a front-page story about Emma's auto accident which portrays Emma in a poor light, but tells Regina that he has found very little of interest in Emma's past.|$|E
5|$|D'Amory was supplanted in the king's favour by Hugh Despenser the Younger, and d'Amory {{fought against}} the king in the Despenser War of 1321-22. After the war, Edward placed the Marches {{under the control of}} the Despensers, with Hugh Despenser the Elder taking {{particular}} responsibility for St Briavels. The Despensers appointed Robert Sapy as the keeper of St Briavels and the other confiscated castles across the Marches. Violence began to break out across the region in response to the Despenser's harsh rule, and Sapy's deputy was attacked in July 1325 on his way back from St Briavels Castle to London; his eyes were <b>torn</b> <b>out,</b> his arms and legs broken and all his records and money stolen. Edward and the Despensers were deposed shortly afterwards by Edward's wife, Isabella of France. Isabella set about expanding her own lands after her victory, and took St Briavels Castle and various other royal castles into her own possession. When Isabella herself was overthrown by her son, Edward III, in 1330 the castle then reverted to the crown.|$|E
5|$|Development work on {{the castle}} continued. There was {{extensive}} restoration of the medieval masonry in 1921, with architect John Grant rebuilding the South Gate and the barbican tower, and reconstructing the medieval West Gate and town wall alongside the castle, with the Swiss Bridge being moved in 1927 {{to make room for}} the new West Gate development. Further archaeological investigations were carried out into the Roman walls in 1922 and 1923, leading to Grant redesigning the northern Roman gatehouse. The second half of the castle stables were finally completed. The Animal Wall was moved in the 1920s to the west side of the castle to enclose a pre-Raphaelite themed garden. The grand staircase in the main range was <b>torn</b> <b>out</b> in the 1930s. During World War II, extensive air-raid shelters were tunnelled out within the medieval walls, with eight different sections, able to hold up to 1,800 people in total, and the castle was also used to tether barrage balloons above the city.|$|E
50|$|Atoc was {{reportedly}} {{captured in the}} battle and suffered a most gruesome death {{at the hands of}} Chalkuchimac. Some sources suggest his head was used as a golden cup, others that he was left on the battlefield with his eyes <b>torned</b> <b>out.</b> Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa claims he and second-in command Hango were flayed and their skins used as drums. Ullco Colla, lord of the defected Tumipampa tribe, died in battle and his city captured shortly after, but reportedly spared by Atahualpa.|$|R

5|$|Throughout the late-1970s and the 1980s, the Nazareth-based firm Beatty Contractors erected {{the candle}} each year. The firm {{originally}} did {{the project for}} free, but began charging $2,000 in 1981 when the cost of fuel started to rise. During the Peace Candle lighting ceremony on November 28, 1980, Easton Mayor Philip Mitman dedicated the candle to the 52 American hostages being held in Iran during the Iran hostage crisis. During a storm on December 6, 1983, 47 mile-per-hour winds caused the Peace Candle to start tilting in place. When city workers removed the flame next day, they realized the bugler statue atop the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument had moved on its base and would have toppled over {{had it not been}} leaning against the candle structure. One of the candle's anchor cables was also snapped by the wind and <b>torn</b> <b>out</b> of the brickwork. The cable was repaired and the bugler statue, which was previously held by its own weight, was reinforced with grouting. A sixteen-pound chunk of granite was also dislodged {{from the top of the}} statue, although in an area that most spectators cannot see from ground level. The candle suffered similar damage in 1988, when high winds loosened parts of the structure and snapped support wires. As a result, it had to be taken down early on January 5, 1989. In 1985, the Easton Area Christmas Committee was renamed to the Easton Holiday Committee.|$|E

50|$|Southern had {{originally}} written {{the character of}} the small-town lawyer (played by Jack Nicholson) with his friend Rip Torn in mind, but <b>Torn</b> dropped <b>out</b> of the project after an altercation with Hopper in a New York restaurant, in which the two actors almost came to blows.|$|R
60|$|He unwound the {{handkerchief}} {{and held out}} his hand. It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been. It had been hacked or <b>torn</b> right <b>out</b> from the roots.|$|R
25|$|On {{the first}} day of the annual conference of the European Association for Chinese Studies (EACS), with several hundred attendees, Xu Lin ordered the {{programs}} seized. Four pages were <b>torn</b> <b>out</b> of the program before they were re-issued to conference attendees the next day.|$|E
25|$|Adoption {{had to be}} with {{consent of}} the natural parents, who usually {{executed}} a deed making over the child, who thus ceased to have any claim upon them. But vestals, hierodules, certain palace officials and slaves had no rights over their children and could raise no objection. Orphans and illegitimate children had no parents to object. Ingratitude by adopted children was severely frowned on by the law: if the adopted child of a prostitute abandoned his foster parents {{and returned to his}} biological father's house, his eye was <b>torn</b> <b>out.</b> If an adopted child rejected his foster parents, claiming they were not his mother and father, his tongue was <b>torn</b> <b>out.</b> An adopted child was a full heir; the contract might even assign him the position of eldest son. Usually, he was residuary legatee.|$|E
25|$|Now in poor condition, the {{original}} manuscript probably consisted of 16 leavesâ€”31 handwritten {{pages of a}} working draft of the play (foul papers), with the last page blank. Two or three of {{the original}} leaves have been <b>torn</b> <b>out,</b> and seven leaves and two smaller pieces of paper have been inserted.|$|E

The right {{main landing gear}} struck the seawall of the reclaimed land on which the runway was laid and was <b>torn</b> <b>out,</b> causing the aircraft to run off the runway and slip into the harbour. Seven people were killed.|$|E
60|$|He {{admired her}} voice as well poised as her movements, as her attitudes. He himself {{had always been}} a man of {{tranquil}} tones.

25|$|The Buildings Department {{discovered}} in November 1997 that defective concrete {{had been used}} in the capitals of columns supporting the fifth floor of 300 Riverside Boulevard, which had been built to 20 stories high by then. Fearing that the planned 46-story structure might collapse if the building rose to even 30 stories, the City halted construction. Work on 300 Riverside Boulevard resumed in early 1998 after the defective concrete was <b>torn</b> <b>out</b> and new concrete was poured.|$|E
25|$|Because {{irrigation}} was {{the source}} of wealth and foundation of the empire, the Moche culture emphasized the importance of circulation and flow. Expanding upon this, Moche artwork frequently depicted the passage of fluids, particularly life fluids through vulnerable human orifices. There are countless images of defeated warriors losing life fluids through their nose, or helpless victims getting their eyes <b>torn</b> <b>out</b> by birds or captors. Images of captive sex-slaves with gaping orifices and leaking fluids portray extreme exposure, humiliation, and a loss of power.|$|E
25|$|Protesters {{eventually}} {{flooded the}} city centre area, from PiaÈ›a KogÄƒlniceanu to PiaÈ›a Unirii, PiaÈ›a Rosetti and PiaÈ›a RomanÄƒ. In one notable {{scene from the}} event, a young man waved a tricolor with the Communist coat of arms <b>torn</b> <b>out</b> of its centre while perched on the statue of Mihai Viteazul on Boulevard Mihail CogÄƒlniceanu in the University Square. Many others began to emulate the young protester, and the waving and displaying of the Romanian flag with the Communist insignia cut out quickly became widespread.|$|E

Jessie Morris of Complex commented that the song sounds like a [...] "page <b>torn</b> right <b>out</b> of Demi Lovato's Confident book", while editors of other media platforms like Idolator noticed this as well, which raised speculation that the track was intentionally written for Lovato.|$|R

25|$|Substantial {{stretches}} of the late mediaeval tile floors survive to this day. An inscription which used to lie before {{the entrance to the}} canons' refectory, was later covered and preserved beneath the steps leading up to Wriothesley's banqueting hall. Two other patches of tiling survive {{to the north of the}} gatehouse. Following the expulsion of the canons, these were concealed beneath the spiral staircases installed in Wriothesley's reconstruction, and therefore escaped being <b>torn</b> <b>out</b> with the rest of the tiles along the cloister walk. In winter, the tiles are covered over with sand by English Heritage staff in order to protect them from damage in the cold weather.|$|E
25|$|Traffic and {{transportation}} remain {{a problem in}} urban areas. Solutions are implemented, but inevitably the implementation expense and {{the time required to}} plan, approve, and build infrastructure can't keep pace with the population growth. There have been some improvements. Carpool lanes have become common in urban areas, which are intended to encourage people to drive together rather than in individual automobiles. San Jose is gradually building a light rail system (often over routes of an original turn-of-the-century electric railroad line that was <b>torn</b> <b>out</b> and paved over to encourage the advent of the automobile age). None of the implemented solutions are without their critics. The sprawling nature of the Bay Area and of the Los Angeles Basin makes it difficult to build mass transit that can reach and serve {{a significant portion of the}} population.|$|E
25|$|In ritual fashion, the Indians scalped, stripped, and {{mutilated}} the soldiers' bodies before leaving. In {{his report}} to his superiors, Carrington listed what was discovered at the battlefield the next day: eyes <b>torn</b> <b>out</b> and laid on rocks, noses and ears cut off, teeth chopped out, brains taken out {{and placed on}} rocks, hands and feet cut off, private parts severed. The two civilians, Wheatley and Fisher, had had their faces smashed into bloody pulp, and Wheatley had been pierced {{by more than a}} hundred arrows. The last trooper to die in the battle may have been Adolph Metzger, a bugler who used his instrument as a weapon until it was battered shapeless. Metzger was the only soldier whose dead body was not mutilated. The Indians covered him with a buffalo hide. Some historians interpreted that as a tribute to his bravery in standing alone against several armed enemies.|$|E
