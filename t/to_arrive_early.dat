25|$|In the post-Reconstruction era South, lynching {{photographs}} were printed for various purposes, including postcards, newspapers and event mementos. Typically these images depicted an African-American lynching victim and {{all or part}} of the crowd in attendance. Spectators often included women and children. The perpetrators of lynchings were not identified. At one particular lynching, it is said that nearly 15,000 people were in attendance. Often lynchings were advertised in newspapers prior to the event in order to give photographers time <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>early</b> and prepare their camera equipment. After the lynching, photographers would sell their pictures as-is or as postcards, sometimes costing as much as fifty cents a piece, or $, as of 2016.|$|E
25|$|The {{failure of}} the British {{artillery}} support <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>early</b> in the day meant that Le Muy remained in enemy hands, but the British secured the high ground along {{both sides of the}} Argens River east of Le Muy, and also the high ground to the north, establishing road blocks and patrols, while the 517th PRCT occupied the hills overlooking the Toulon-Saint-Raphaël corridor in the vicinity of Les Arcs, five miles west of Le Muy, and the 509th dug in on the high ground south of Les Muy with eleven 75mm guns in position overlooking the town. The first contact with ground forces was made that evening about 20:30 when troops of the 509th PIB met a patrol from the U.S. 45th Division's reconnaissance troop. An attempt to capture Le Muy was mounted by the 550th GIB after dark, but the attack failed and the battalion withdrew to wait until morning. Except for the seizure of the town, the 1ABTF completed its D-Day objectives, establishing a strong blocking position along the Argens Valley and isolating the beachhead. The scattered parachute drop did not appreciably affect the operation and may have helped confuse the Germans as to the objectives of both the airborne and amphibious assaults.|$|E

50|$|The Dodentocht (Dutch for March of the Dead) is {{a long-distance}} march of 100 {{kilometers}} organized annually in Bornem, Belgium, since 1970. The grueling march derives {{its name from}} the length of the march and the rough and forested terrain. At the 2016 edition, 12,608 participants had registered. A scouting group also organises a campsite for the participants; the campsite can hold 500 people that want <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>earlier.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Long ago, the {{expected}} {{date of delivery}} was determined by taking the phase of the moon into consideration. [...] A delivery during a full moon was considered dangerous to {{the child and the}} mother. The arrival of the midwife at the home of the expectant mother varied. [...] Sometimes the family would call the midwife when the labor started and sometimes she would arrive at the home {{a few days before the}} anticipated birth. [...] This was probably dependent on the proximity of the midwife to the woman’s house. [...] The midwife and her assistant would assist with chores around the house if they were able <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>early.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese commander, Terunuma, {{attempting}} {{to buy time}} for the Japanese forces withdrawing from Cape Gloucester, reinforced the troops {{attempting to}} hold Talasea, sending another company forward throughout the night of 6/7 March. In the darkness, {{they were able to}} advance to within [...] of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines' positions. Nevertheless, these troops withdrew shortly after dawn when the Marines launched an early morning attack on 7 March. Throughout the day heavy fighting followed as the Americans advanced towards the opposite coast, sending patrols out towards the hills to the south in order to secure their flank. As they approached Mount Schleuther elements of the Japanese 54th Infantry Regiment, moving west along the high ground in an effort to cut the Marines off, began to pour heavy fire down on the Americans. In response, Company 'E' established a strong base of fire while Company 'F'– with covering fire from artillery and mortars– was hurriedly dispatched to gain a position from which to launch an attack by fire, with elements of Company 'H' protecting their right flank. Arriving ahead of the Japanese, the Marines began firing down on them, killing 40 in a one sided battle that pushed them down the reverse slope. Meanwhile, the US reinforcements– the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines– that had been scheduled <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>early</b> on 7 March were delayed until the afternoon, when they began taking over responsibility for the defense of the beachhead from the 1st Battalion. As a result, the plan for the envelopment of the village of Liapo, southwest of Little Mount Worri, and Waru, west of the emergency landing strip at Talasea, had to be modified. Instead of having one battalion proceed straight up the track while the crossed the mountains, a company from the 1st Battalion was sent through the scrub, west of the hills, towards Liapo. Hindered by the dense jungle they became isolated and had to harbor up for the night, while the 2nd Battalion established a night perimeter around part of Mount Schleuther and Bitokara track.|$|E

50|$|As a result, {{stations}} that see large passenger flow, {{such as the}} Beijing West Railway Station, are obliged to set up extra ticket inspection counters to allow only legal holders of train tickets to enter the waiting area or the station area at all, especially during the Spring Festival travel peak. The {{result has been a}} requirement for more passengers <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>earlier</b> at stations. It did not completely eradicate scalpers, but did reduce their activity significantly.|$|R
60|$|The baby's offence against {{society in}} {{coming into the}} world was {{forgotten}} by the girl-mother; her soul's desire was to continue that offence by preserving {{the life of the}} child. However, it soon grew clear that the hour of emancipation for that little prisoner of the flesh was <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>earlier</b> than her worst misgiving had conjectured. And when she had discovered this she was plunged into a misery which transcended that of the child's simple loss. Her baby had not been baptized.|$|R

60|$|King Blanchardin {{had brought}} Orlando's people a luxurious supper; King Marsilius was <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>early</b> next {{day with the}} tribute; and Uliviero accordingly, with the morning sun, rode forth to reconnoitre, {{and see if he}} could {{discover}} the peaceful pomp of the Spanish court in the distance. Guottibuoffi was with him, a warrior who had expected the very worst, and repeatedly implored Orlando to believe it possible. Uliviero and he rode up the mountain nearest them, and from the top of it beheld the first army of Marsilius already forming in the passes.|$|E

At last the sound came,--that quick light bowling of the gig-wheels,--and in spite of the wind, which was blowing the clouds about, and was not likely to respect Mrs. Tulliver's curls and cap-strings, she came outside the door, and even held her hand on Maggie's offending head, forgetting all the griefs of the morning.|$|E

50|$|The nearest {{station to}} the stadium is Shimizu, however, being over 4 km from the ground, the {{majority}} of spectators arrive on foot or by shuttle bus services from Shimizu Station, Shizuoka Station and other nearby areas. The shuttle bus service starts running three hours before kick off, but for supporters wishing <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>earlier,</b> the local bus lines have services which run near Nihondaira, with the closest bus stops to be found ten minutes walk from the stadium. The nearest Shinkansen station is ten minutes by local train west of Shimizu at Shizuoka. There is limited car parking at the stadium or surrounding areas.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1998, race spectators were {{diverted}} to park at Epcot, and {{were taken by}} shuttle bus to the Speedway while guests to the Magic Kingdom were directed to park, as usual, in the Magic Kingdom parking lot. While this eased many theme park guest complaints, it was now inconvenient for race spectators as it necessitated them <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>to</b> account for the additional travel time. It additionally resulted in a significant cost increase in race operations, as the Disney Transport bus fleet was not big enough to accommodate the race shuttle operation. As a result, outside bus companies had to be hired to run the race shuttle service.|$|R

40|$|We {{analysed}} phenological {{observations on}} spring arrival of 54 avian species to Barguzinsky Nature Reserve in 1938 - 2001. Twenty-eight species (52 %) showed a trend towards earlier ar-rival, 14 species (26 %) showed a trend towards later arrival. In 12 species (22 %) {{the timing of}} spring arrival did not change. Most avian species that started <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>earlier</b> were passerines (65 % of species). Later arrival was mainly recorded in waterfowl and birds of prey. Earlier ar-rival recorded in roughly one-half of the species analysed, is probably due to climate warming recorded in the study region in the late 20 th century. These species may be treated as pheno-logical indicators illustrating climate change in the northeastern Baikal area...|$|R

40|$|To {{estimate}} {{the proportion of}} patients with stroke likely {{to be eligible for}} a trial of anticoagulant treatment for acute ischaemic stroke, the interval between onset of symptoms and arrival at hospital was analysed prospectively. Of 773 patients with stroke admitted in one year, 63 % arrived at hospital within 12 hours, 76 % within 24 hours, and 85 % within 48 hours of ictus. The arrival time varied significantly with stroke subtype. Patients with intracerebral haemorrhage tended <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>earlier</b> than those with cerebral infarct, who arrived sooner than those with lacunar infarct. The results suggest that about half of all patients with ischaemic stroke in Hong Kong would present within 12 hours of ictus, in time for inclusion in a therapeutic trial...|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{a species}} may react {{in one of}} the other two ways, by moving or by adapting, and yet find that its efforts do not save it from extinction. While not yet extinct, the Pied Flycatcher, a small insectivorous bird that migrates to Western Europe from Africa each spring, has {{declined}} to 10% of its former population. This has occurred {{at the same time as}} a main food source for the young flycatchers, caterpillars, have begun to peak much earlier. Although the birds have also begun <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>earlier,</b> they have not yet caught up to the peaking of the caterpillars. This individual species may or may not go extinct, but it goes to demonstrate that a species can sometimes begin to move or adapt and yet find itself dying nevertheless (Pimm 2009).|$|R
50|$|In January 1943, the 53d Fighter Group {{was moved}} to Page Field from Sixth Air Force in Panama. From this point on, {{the mission of the}} base became the {{training}} of replacement single-engine fighter pilots.

50|$|When 1974 came, engines {{were still}} not being {{delivered}} in sufficient numbers, although some started <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>early</b> that year. At that point, unexpectedly, Hirth went bankrupt after about 500 engines had shipped. Once again, the BD-5 lacked a suitable engine, {{but this time}} the search for a replacement ended with a Zenoah design from Japan. Development of this engine was lengthy, and in the end it would not be certified for export until 1978, although this was not anticipated at the time.|$|E
50|$|In early April it was {{reported}} that at least 250 climbers on 27 expeditions were headed for Mount Everest. This grew to 289 climbers from 34 groups by April 20, 2017.
