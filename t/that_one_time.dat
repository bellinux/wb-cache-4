Guruh recalled that Chrisye would sleep anywhere during extended planning sessions, including under the piano.|$|E

He began as an Untersturmführer (Second lieutenant) and was promoted three times by Himmler, the last time in June 1943 to SS-Sturmbannführer (Major). Von Braun later claimed that these were simply technical promotions received each year regularly by mail.|$|E

500|$|The Associated Press {{reported}} that Piane was [...] "drawn to the musicality of Bale's rage-filled voice". Piane spent three hours {{working on the}} remix. [...] "When I heard Christian Bale flip out I had to remix the track.... It's good to hear that clubs have already started playing it as it is very funny," [...] said Piane. In an interview with LA Weekly, Piane commented that he wants his remix remembered, instead of Bale's outburst: [...] "We're all people in this world.

500|$|But this contradicted O'Neal's {{own account}} of the {{relationship}} in 1995 in Vibe, where she remembered Jackson as [...] "being so shy" [...] and [...] "one of the nicest, most innocent people I've ever met", and, [...] "Once he came into my bedroom, and he wouldn't even sit on my bed." [...] She described the relationship as [...] "a really wonderful friendship" [...] where they would dance and [...] "talk on the phone all the time." [...] She recalled that he found it funny that she could drive at 12 and he couldn't. And <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> they had a [...] "jam session" [...] at her house where he played the drums and her brother played guitar. She said the relationship ended when she was 12, after {{he asked her to}} go to the premiere of The Wiz with him, but her agent disapproved, [...] "maybe because they thought he wasn't a big enough star yet", and she did what she was told because she was a child. [...] While she claimed they never spoke after that, they were actually shown to be together a number of times after this would have happened.|$|E
500|$|This {{remained}} {{a point of}} contention until 1929, when Brownlee and King agreed on a new wording: [...] "organized {{in accordance with the}} laws of the Province, but in keeping with the letter and the spirit of the constitution." [...] The federal government had already agreed to continue the resource subsidy in perpetuity, but Brownlee objected to its plans to base the amount on Alberta's 1929 population, which would see it receive less than Saskatchewan in perpetuity despite having a much faster-growing population. [...] When the federal Turgeon Commission recommended that Manitoba, in addition to a perpetual subsidy, receive a one-time payment of more than $4 million, Brownlee demanded the same for Alberta. [...] King countered that the purpose of <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> payment was to compensate Manitoba for years during which it, unlike Alberta and Saskatchewan, did not receive a subsidy; Brownlee responded that the federal government had given away more than three times as much of Alberta's land as Manitoba's to the railways. [...] King left the meeting in protest against this new demand, but he was determined to settle with Manitoba and Alberta in order to isolate Saskatchewan Premier James Thomas Milton Anderson and his more extravagant demands. [...] He eventually accepted Brownlee's terms, and an agreement was signed December 14, 1929. [...] The agreement provided for an annual subsidy of $562,000 until Alberta's population reached 800,000 and $750,000 until it reached 1,200,000, after which it would be $1,125,000.|$|E

500|$|Following his San Francisco sojourn, Divine {{returned}} to Baltimore {{and participated in}} Waters's next film Pink Flamingos. Designed by Waters to be [...] "an exercise in poor taste," [...] the film featured Divine as Babs Johnson, a woman who claims to be [...] "the filthiest person alive" [...] and who is forced to prove her right to the title from challengers, Connie (Mink Stole) and Raymond Marble (David Lochary). In one scene, the Marbles send Babs a turd in a box as a birthday present, {{and in order to}} enact this scene, Divine defecated into the box the night before. Filmed in a hippie commune in Phoenix, Maryland, the cast members spent much of the time smoking cigarettes and marijuana and taking amphetamines, although all of the scenes had been heavily rehearsed beforehand. The final scene in the film proved particularly infamous, involving Babs eating fresh dog feces; Divine later told a reporter, [...] "I followed that dog around for three hours just zooming in on its asshole," [...] waiting for it to empty its bowels so that they could film the scene. The scene {{became one of the most}} notable moments of Divine's acting career, and he later complained of people thinking that [...] "I run around doing it all the time. I've received boxes of dog shit– plastic dog shit. I have gone to parties where people just sit around and talk about dog shit because they think it's what I want to talk about." [...] In reality, he remarked, he was not a coprophile but only ate excrement <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> because it was in the script.|$|E

2500|$|The {{selection}} of Jones to the U.S. 2014 Winter Olympics bobsled team was criticized by some American bobsledders as happening {{due to her}} fame. Curt Tomasevicz said, [...] "It's {{hard for me to}} name one or two athletes that would completely agree with that decision." [...] Emily Azevedo, who was competing with Katie Eberling and Jones for a spot on the team, said: [...] "I should have been working harder on gaining Twitter followers than gaining muscle mass." [...] Neither Eberling or Azevedo blamed Jones for her selection. United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation CEO Darrin Steele defended the selection: [...] "I haven't heard anyone making the argument about Lolo not being a better athlete right now, a better brakeman for the team. I don't think I've come across <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>time.</b> I've heard a lot about history and all that's nice. But who's going to provide the best results for the U.S. team in Sochi?

2500|$|Trần Thủ Độ {{was also}} an honest {{mandarin}} who never profited his high position {{for the benefit of}} his family. It was said <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> the Emperor wanted to appointed Trần Thủ Độ's elder brother Trần An Quốc for the position of grand chancellor. Trần Thủ Độ politely declined the Emperor's request by an answer: [...] "An Quốc is my brother, if he is better than me then I had better retire from the position, but if Your Majesty think that I am better than him, so please not appoint him for grand chancellor. Because if we hold the same position then what royal court will become?". For his dedication, the Emperor personally redacted an epitaph for Trần Thủ Độ in his tomb. However, Trần Thủ Độ still remains as a controversial figure in History of Vietnam for his ruthless decisions against members of Lý royal family and his responsibility in the forced marriage between Trần Thái Tông and his brother Trần Liễu's wife, which was highly criticized by feudal historians. Sometimes, his Machiavellian figure was compared with Dorgon, the powerful general who helped establish the Qing Dynasty's rule in China, or Cardinal Mazarin who was chief minister of France for 20 years.|$|E
2500|$|A new and {{short-lived}} {{option for}} 1970 was the vacuum operated exhaust (VOE), which was vacuum actuated via an underdash lever marked [...] "exhaust". The VOE {{was designed to}} reduce exhaust backpressure and to increase power and performance, but it also substantially increased exhaust noise. The VOE option was offered from November 1969 to January 1970. Pontiac management was ordered to cancel the VOE option by GM's upper management following a TV commercial for the GTO that aired during Super Bowl IV on CBS January 11, 1970. In that commercial, entitled the [...] "Humbler", which was broadcast only <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>time,</b> a young man pulled up in a new GTO to a drive-in restaurant with dramatic music and exhaust noise in the background, pulling the [...] "exhaust" [...] knob to activate the VOE and then left the drive-in after failing to find a street racing opponent. That particular commercial was also cancelled by order of GM management. Approximately 233 1970 GTOs were factory built with this rare option including 212 hardtop coupes and 21 convertbiles, all were [...] "YS" [...] 400ci 350hp with either four-speed manual or Turbo Hydra-matic transmissions. This particular GTO in the commercial was [...] "Palladium" [...] silver with a black bucket interior. It was unusual in several respects as it also had the under-dash [...] "Ram Air" [...] knob just {{to the right of}} the VOE knob, and it sported [...] "'69 Judge" [...] stripes, as a few very-early '70 GTOs could be ordered with. It also had a Turbo Hydra-matic transmission, remote mirror, Rally II wheels, A/C, hood tach, and a new-for-1970 Formula steering wheel.|$|E
