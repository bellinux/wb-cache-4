5|$|<b>The</b> <b>End</b> <b>Of</b> <b>Life</b> date (EOL, sunset date) for Python 2.7 was {{initially}} set at 2015, then postponed to 2020 {{out of concern}} that {{a large body of}} existing code cannot easily be forward-ported to Python 3. In January 2017, Google announced work on a Python 2.7 to Go transcompiler, which The Register speculated was in response to Python 2.7's planned end-of-life but Google cited performance under concurrent workloads as their only motivation.|$|E
5|$|The main {{pathological}} {{characteristics of}} PD are cell {{death in the}} brain's basal ganglia (affecting up to 70% of the dopamine secreting neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta by <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>life)</b> {{and the presence of}} Lewy bodies (accumulations of the protein alpha-synuclein) in many of the remaining neurons. This loss of neurons is accompanied by the death of astrocytes (star-shaped glial cells) and {{a significant increase in the}} number of microglia (another type of glial cell) in the substantia nigra.|$|E
5|$|Since then, {{the hospice}} {{industry}} has rapidly expanded. This growth has accompanied the AIDS epidemic and {{the aging of}} the population, with related illnesses. By 1995, hospices were a $2.8 billion industry, with $1.9 billion from Medicare alone funding patients in 1,857 hospice programs with Medicare certification. In that year, 72% of hospice providers were non-profit. By 1998, there were 3,200 hospices either in operation or under development throughout the United States and Puerto Rico, according to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO). According to 2007's Last Rights: Rescuing <b>the</b> <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> from the Medical System, hospice sites are expanding at a national rate of about 3.5% per year. In 2007, 1.4 million people in the United States used hospice, with more than one-third of dying Americans using the service, approximately 39%. In 2008, Medicare alone, which pays for 80% of hospice treatment, paid $10 billion to the 4,000 Medicare-certified providers in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Near <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> {{fluorescent}} lamps can start flickering at a frequency {{lower than the}} power frequency. This {{is due to a}} dynamic instability inherent in the negative resistance of the plasma source, which can be from a bad lamp, a bad ballast, or a bad starter; or occasionally from a poor connection to power.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> {{failure mode}} for {{fluorescent}} lamps {{varies depending on}} how they are used and their control gear type. Often the light will turn pink (see Loss of mercury), with black burns {{on the ends of}} the lamp due to sputtering of emission mix (see below).

25|$|The {{capacitance}} {{of certain}} capacitors decreases as the component ages. In ceramic capacitors, this {{is caused by}} degradation of the dielectric. The type of dielectric, ambient operating and storage temperatures are the most significant aging factors, while the operating voltage has a smaller effect. The aging process may be reversed by heating the component above the Curie point. Aging is fastest {{near the beginning of}} life of the component, and the device stabilizes over time. Electrolytic capacitors age as the electrolyte evaporates. In contrast with ceramic capacitors, this occurs towards <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> of the component.|$|E

25|$|The fear of <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and its {{existence}} is {{in other words}} the fear of death. The fear of death ritualized {{the lives of our}} ancestors. These rituals were designed to reduce that fear; they helped collect the cultural ideas that we now have in the present. These rituals also helped preserve the cultural ideas. The results and methods of human existence had been changing {{at the same time that}} social formation was changing. One can say that the formation of communities happened because people lived in fear. The result of this fear forced people to unite to fight dangers together rather than fight alone.|$|E
25|$|Psychiatrists and {{clinical}} psychologists are often asked {{to evaluate a}} patient's capacity for making life-and-death decisions at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Persons with a psychiatric condition such as delirium or clinical depression may lack capacity to make end-of-life decisions. For these persons, a request to refuse treatment may be taken {{in the context of}} their condition. Unless there is a clear advance directive to the contrary, persons lacking mental capacity are treated according to their best interests. This will involve an assessment involving people who know the person best to what decisions the person would have made had they not lost capacity. Persons with the mental capacity to make end-of-life decisions may refuse treatment with the understanding that it may shorten their life. Psychiatrists and psychologists may be involved to support decision making.|$|E
