40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{analyzing}} {{the changes to}} aerosol properties caused by the dust storm called “China’s Great Wall of Dust” that originated from the Taklimakan Desert in April 2014. IDDI (Infrared Difference Dust Index) images from FY- 2 E and true color composite images from FY- 3 C MERSI (Medium Resolution Spectral Imager) show the breakout and transport path of the dust storm. Three-hourly ground-based measurements from MICAPS (Meteorological Information Comprehensive Analysis and Process System) suggest that anticyclonic circulation occupying the Southern Xinjiang basin and cyclonic circulation in Mongolia form a dipole pressure system that leads to strong northwesterly winds (13. 7 – 20 m/s), which favored the breakout of the dust storm. IDDI {{results indicate that the}} dust storm breakout occurred at ~ 2 : 00 UTC on 23 April in the Taklimakan Desert. Four-day forward air mass trajectories with the HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model gives the simulation results of the dust transport paths and dust vertical distributions, which are consistent with the corresponding aerosol vertical distributions derived from CALIPSO. The Aerosol Index (AI) data of TOU (<b>Total</b> <b>Ozone</b> <b>Unit)</b> aboard FY- 3 B are first used to study the areas affected by the dust storm. From the AI results, the dust-affected areas agree well with the synoptic meteorological condition analysis, which supports that the synoptic meteorological conditions are the main reason for the breakout and transport of the dust storm. Anomalies of the average MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth) distributions over northeast Asia during the dust storm to the average of the values in April between 2010 and 2014 are calculated as a percent. The results indicate high aerosol loading with a spatially-averaged anomaly of 121 % for dusty days between 23 April and 25 April. Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) retrievals of VSD (Volume Size Distribution) and SSA (Single Scattering Albedo) show that while the aerosol properties in Dalanzadgad, which is closer to the dust source, were influenced primarily by coarse dust particles, the aerosol properties in Beijing were mostly contributed by fine dust particles that transported over longer distances and at high atmospheric levels...|$|E

Two year ozonesonde data, January 1981 to December 1982, observed at four Canadian stations and 2. 5 year backscattered ultraviolet experiment data on the Nimbus- 4 satellite, April 1970 to August 1972, observed over five American stations were used to study {{the relationship between the}} <b>total</b> <b>ozone,</b> vertical height {{distribution of}} the ozone mixing ratio, vertical height distribution of half <b>total</b> <b>ozone,</b> and the local tropopause height. The results show that there is a postive correlation between <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> in Dobson <b>Units</b> and the tropopause height in terms of atmospheric pressure.

Large percentage differences in <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> at northern fall polar latitudes identified through the assimilation process are linked with excessive northward transport of water vapour west of Tharsis and over Arabia Terra. Modelling biases in water vapour can also explain the underestimation of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> between 45 °S– 10 °S from L S = 135 – 180 °.

The first two modes for <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> describe the anomalous <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> patterns associated with the extremes in the Southern Oscillation. The first mode has the largest loadings in the southern hemisphere (SH) subtropics and midlatitudes with an east-west dipole in antiphase with a tropical east-west dipole. The second mode has its largest loadings in the tropics with an east-west dipolar pattern. These modes are intimately related to variations in the mean temperature in the lower stratosphere, and this relation is such that the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> and mean temperature anomalies are positively correlated. The tropospheric temperature patterns are confined in the tropics, where temperature and <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> anomalies are negatively correlated. The tropical temperature and <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> variations are driven by modulations in the tropical convection associated with the Southern Oscillation. The Southern Oscillation signals in the stratospheric temperature and in the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> are strongest in the SH midlatitudes during the winter-spring period and precede the extremes in the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) by a few months.

The ground-based data show good {{agreement with the}} satellite data (the correlation coefficient r is 0. 942) {{but there is a}} systematic difference between the two data sets. In general, the TOMS ozone is about 3 % higher than the Brewer ozone. The seasonal variations of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> and UV radiation from January 1995 to April 2001 are discussed. <b>Total</b> <b>ozone</b> has a seasonal cycle, it reaches a maximum in May and minimum in January. A quasi-biennial oscillation signal is clearly identified in the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> time series. Surface UV radiation also exhibits seasonal cycles that have maxima in July and minima in January. The solar zenith angle (SZA) is confirmed as a crucial factor governing both the seasonal change and magnitude of the surface UV radiation. Clouds and <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> are also important. The relationship between <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> and surface UV is discussed. The variability of surface UV due to SZA and cloud are eliminated by selecting UV measurements taken at 451 SZA and under a clear sky. The filtered UV-B shows an anti-correlation with <b>total</b> <b>ozone.</b> It is estimated that 1 % increase of <b>total</b> column <b>ozone</b> can cause a 1 % decrease of surface UV-B. The analysis has shown that within the period January 1995 –April 2001, the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> over Hong Kong increased and surface UV decreased...|$|R
40|$|Longitudinal {{inhomogeneity}} of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> {{distribution is}} investigated {{in association with}} dynamical variations in the troposphere and the stratosphere. First, {{in order to see}} the spatial correlation between the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> and dynamical fields we do a statistical analysis using 10 years of the <b>Total</b> <b>Ozone</b> Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> data and the Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU) geopotential height and temperature data. Correlation coefficients between longitudinal anomalies of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> and lower stratospheric temperature are positive and significantly large in mid-and high latitudes, though the seasonality is much stronger for the planetary scale (wavenumbers 1 and 2) variations than for the synoptic scale (wavenumbers 4 to 6). Next, by using the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) ozone profile data, we do case studies to investigate where the main contribution to the wave structure in the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> field comes from. It is found in mid-and high latutudes that the synoptic disturbances in <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> are mainly due to the variation of ozone around the bottom of the stratosphere and that the planetary scale disturbances are due to that over the lower stratosphere. During the spring in the southern hemisphere, however, there are some exceptional situations in which chemical reactions in the polar vortex decrease ozone in a thin layer of the lower stratosphere...|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{comparison}} of the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> column data from three satellite instruments; <b>Total</b> <b>Ozone</b> Mapping Spectrometers (TOMS) on board the Earth Probe (EP), Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on board AURA and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) on board ERS/ 2, with ground-based measurement recorded by a well calibrated Brewer spectrophotometer located in Madrid during the period 1996 – 2008. A cluster classification based on solar radiation (global, direct and diffuse), cloudiness and aerosol index allow selecting hazy, cloudy, very cloudy and clear days. Thus, the differences between Brewer and satellite <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> data for each cluster have been analyzed. The accuracy of EP-TOMS <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> data is affected by moderate cloudiness, showing a mean absolute bias error (MABE) of 2. 0 %. In addition, the turbidity also has a significant influence on EP-TOMS <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> data with a MABE ~ 1. 6 %. Those data are in contrast with clear days with MABE ~ 1. 2 %. The <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> data derived from the OMI instrument show clear bias at clear and hazy days with small uncertainties (~ 0. 8 %). Finally, the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> observations obtained with the GOME instrument show a very smooth dependence with respect to clouds and turbidity, showing a robust retrieval algorithm over these conditions...|$|R
40|$|Utilizing a {{stepwise}} {{multiple regression}} scheme, monthly mean global maps of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> are produced from the spectral intensity measurements {{made by the}} infrared interferometer spectrometer (IRIS) onboard the Nimbus 3 satellite for the period April 18 to July 22, 1969. These maps show that over the equatorial regions <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> increases steadily from April to July. Further, latitudinal variation of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> derived from these maps shows that the ozone increases at all latitudes over the Southern Hemisphere uniformly from April to July while over the Northern Hemisphere the monthly decrease at all latitudes is nonuniform. In general, these maps bear a close resemblance to the upper tropospheric circulation. It is observed that the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> is best correlated with the 200 mb geopotential heights. This relationship enables the utilization of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> as a quasi-stream function to determine geostrophic winds at 200 mb level. Further, even at low latitudes where the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> does not bear simple relationship to the geopotential heights {{the course of the}} easterly jet stream {{with the help of the}} ozone measurements can be identified...|$|R
