With these clothes, people grow into their assigned roles and easily adapt to the social structure of Gilead. With the help of symbolic meanings, the responsibilities and roles of groups are enclosed in the uniforms. In time, people lose their originality and characters and become what they wear, which is the main aim of the new ‘designs’...|$|R
