5|$|Although {{they can}} trample plants and ground-nesting animals {{and are not}} {{considered}} to be indigenous to the islands, Bankers are allowed to remain due to their historical significance. <b>They</b> <b>survive</b> by grazing on marsh grasses, which supply them with water as well as food, supplemented by temporary freshwater pools.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{are active}} {{all year long}} in the tropics, but, in cooler regions, <b>they</b> <b>survive</b> the winter {{in a state of}} {{dormancy}} known as hibernation. The forms of inactivity are varied and some temperate species have larvae going into the inactive state (diapause), while in others, the adults alone pass the winter in a state of reduced activity.|$|E
5|$|Soldiers {{can take}} cover behind walls and {{objects in the}} {{environment}} to gain a measure of protection. Units can use suppressive fire to disadvantage enemies, and use active camouflage to maneuver around opponents. Cutscenes and dynamic camera movements emphasise particularly exciting gameplay moments, such as kill sequences and use of special abilities. The game includes some tactical role-playing elements, whereby the player's soldiers can gain new abilities as <b>they</b> <b>survive</b> more battles.|$|E

5|$|Seldom observed, the {{frilled shark}} may capture prey by bending its body and lunging forward like a snake. The long, {{extremely}} flexible jaws {{enable it to}} swallow prey whole, while its many rows of small, needle-like teeth {{make it difficult for}} the prey to escape. It feeds mainly on cephalopods, leavened by bony fishes and other sharks. This species is aplacental viviparous: the embryos emerge from their egg capsules inside the mother's uterus, where <b>they</b> <b>survive</b> primarily on yolk. The gestation period may be as long as three and a half years, the longest of any vertebrate. Litter sizes vary from two to fifteen, and there is no distinct breeding season. Frilled sharks are occasional bycatch in commercial fisheries, but have little economic value.|$|E

On the morning of the bull run, Imran suggests they make a pact to make a promise if <b>they</b> <b>survive</b> the event.

5|$|In 1845, James Howlett, a boy {{living in}} Canada, {{witnesses}} his father {{being killed by}} groundskeeper Thomas Logan. The anxiety activates the boy's mutation: bone claws protrude from his knuckles, and he impales Thomas, who reveals that he is James's birth father before dying. James flees along with Thomas's other son Victor Creed, who is thus James's half-brother and has a healing factor mutation like James. They spend the next century as soldiers, fighting in the American Civil War, both World Wars, and the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, the increasingly violent Victor attempts to rape a Vietnamese woman, and kills a senior officer who tries to stop him. James happens upon the fight and defends Victor, resulting in the pair being sentenced to execution by firing squad, which <b>they</b> <b>survive</b> due to their mutant healing abilities. Major William Stryker approaches them in military custody and offers them membership in Team X, a group of mutants including Agent Zero, Wade Wilson, John Wraith, Fred Dukes, and Chris Bradley. They join the team for a few years, with James now using the alias Logan, but Victor and the group's lack of empathy for human life causes Logan to leave.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} spring, the queen {{comes out of}} {{diapause}} and finds a suitable place to create her colony. Then she builds wax cells in which to lay her eggs which were fertilised the previous year. The eggs that hatch develop into female workers, and in time, the queen populates the colony, with workers feeding the young and performing other duties similar to honeybee workers. In temperate zones, young queens (gynes) leave the nest in the autumn and mate, often more than once, with males (drones) that are forcibly driven out of the colony. The drones and workers die as the weather turns colder; the young queens feed intensively to build up stores of fat for the winter. <b>They</b> <b>survive</b> in a resting state (diapause), generally below ground, until the weather warms up in the spring with the early bumblebee being the species that is {{among the first to}} emerge. Many species of bumblebee follow this general trend within the year. Bombus pensylvanicus is a species that follows this type of colony cycle. For this species the cycle begins in February, reproduction starts in July or August, and ends in the winter months. The queen remains in hibernation until spring of the following year in order to optimize conditions to search for a nest.|$|E
5|$|Jones and Mutt are {{captured}} by Mac and the Soviets {{and taken to}} their camp in the Amazon jungle, where they find Oxley and Mutt's mother, Marion Ravenwood, who reveals that Mutt is Jones' son, Henry Jones III. Spalko believes the crystal skull belongs to an alien life form and holds great psychic power, and that finding more skulls in Akator will grant the Soviets the advantage of psychic warfare. Spalko uses the skull on Jones to enable him to understand Oxley and identify a route to Akator. Jones and his four allies escape with the skull, but Marion and Jones get caught into a dry sandpit, to be recaptured by the Soviets after Oxley accidentally brings them as assistance. On their way to Akator, Mac tells Jones he is a CIA double-agent to regain Jones' trust, and Jones' team fights {{its way out of}} the Soviets' clutches, while Dovchenko is devoured by siafu ants. Jones and his allies cause many of the Soviets to fall from a cliff, and <b>they</b> <b>survive</b> three waterfalls in an amphibious vehicle. Jones and Oxley identify a skull-like rock formation that leads them to Akator, unaware that Mac lied about being a CIA agent, is still loyal to Spalko and has been dropping transceivers to allow the surviving Soviets to track them.|$|E

25|$|Because wax moths cannot {{survive a}} cold winter, {{they are usually}} {{not a problem for}} beekeepers in the {{northern}} U.S. or Canada, unless <b>they</b> <b>survive</b> winter in heated storage, or are brought from the south by purchase or migration of beekeepers.
