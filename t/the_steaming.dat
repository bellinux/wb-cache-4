Only Mary Surratt and Dr. Mudd were not required to wear the hoods. Powell cried when the hood was placed on him.

Tteok is usually served as dessert or as a snack. Among varieties, songpyeon is a chewy stuffed tteok served at Chuseok.

40|$|AbstractWhen {{the unit}} is under normal operating, <b>the</b> <b>steam</b> source of plant-steam is from <b>the</b> fourth <b>steam</b> {{extraction}} of turbine.

In this paper, {{in order to improve}} the economy when the turbine is operating under the low load, reheat cold section steam is used as high-pressure <b>steam</b> to extract <b>the</b> fourth <b>steam</b> by <b>the</b> <b>steam</b> technology, which turns <b>the</b> low-pressure <b>steam</b> into <b>the</b> medium-pressure <b>steam</b> for recycling.

2500|$|From {{an article}} in The New York Times: [...] "He [...] has been to more Army camps and played to more {{soldiers}} than any other entertainer.

He has flown to the cold wastes of Alaska and <b>the</b> <b>steaming</b> forests of Trinidad. He has called at Dutch‑like Curaçao. Nearly every camp {{in this country has}} heard him sing and tell funny stories." [...] Some of the unusual hardships of performing to active troops were described in an article he wrote for Variety, in 1942: [...] "In order to entertain all the boys ... it became necessary for us to give shows in foxholes, gun emplacements, dugouts, to construction groups on military roads; in fact, any place where two or more soldiers were gathered together, it automatically became a Winter Garden for me and I would give a show." [...] After returning from a tour of overseas bases, the Regimental Hostess at one camp wrote to Jolson, [...] "Allow me to say on behalf of all the soldiers of the 33rd Infantry that you coming here is quite the most wonderful thing that has ever happened to us, and we think you're tops, not only as a performer, but as a person.

2500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the novel {{has focused on the}} thematic centrality of technology, yet critics disagree on the novel's stance towards technology. The Glass Bees has variously been characterized as dystopic, technophobic, technologically prescient, and skeptical of technology. Marcus Bullock, Professor Emeritus of English at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, sees the novel as a reversal of Jünger's earlier technological optimism, exemplified in a text like The Worker (1932) which speculates [...] "on the potential of industrial technology to transform human society into an absolute expression of collective organization and total power." [...] The novel's portrayal of technology is closely tied to a nostalgic lament for the perceived loss of a natural, idyllic past, contrasted to a mechanistic, technologically determined present. He often directly states that the past - when horses were used in battle and men saw who they were fighting - is better than the present, where one cannot see one's opponents. He sees happiness and technology as directly opposed: “Human perfection and technical perfection are incompatible. If we strive for one, we must sacrifice the other,” and sees human dignity as highly compromised by technology and machines: “They were hired to do piecework, which was beneath a man’s dignity...what for millenniums had been man’s vocation, joy, and pleasure - to ride a horse, to plow in the morning <b>the</b> <b>steaming</b> field...all this...was now past and gone. Joy in labor had disappeared". For Richard, the extent of mechanization in the novel's world undermines the autonomy of the individual and threatens to place all social relations within an [...] "instrumental order of identity" [...] based upon [...] "a hierarchy of efficiency." [...] The theme of the “connection between the eternal, technological present and the ideas and hopes of the ancient historical past” is one used by Jünger in more than one work. Scenes in The Glass Bees such as the discovery of the severed ears prompt reflection on the fragmenting effect of modern technologies, which serve to undermine nature, experience, and the human body as organic, meaningful integral totalities. Furthermore, the novel's focus on the nanoscale throws the very distinction between the organic and the mechanical into question, threatening to render it obsolete.|$|E

50|$|In {{this type}} of {{compounding}} <b>the</b> <b>steam</b> is expanded {{in a number of}} stages, instead of just one (nozzle) in the velocity compounding.
