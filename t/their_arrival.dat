50|$|Russian {{people are}} {{greater part of}} the inbound tourist flow, {{but there is no}} proper number of <b>their</b> <b>arrivals</b> as the border between Russia and Belarus is crossed without any control {{as a part of the}} Union State policy.

In the following years, assistance was also provided by Italian merchants who established themselves in Syrian ports, and from the religious and military orders of the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller, which were created during Baldwin I's reign.|$|E

5|$|Arnold, {{convinced}} that Crown Point {{was no longer}} viable {{as a point of}} defense against the large British force, destroyed and abandoned the fort, moving the forces stationed there to Ticonderoga.

On <b>their</b> <b>arrival,</b> the released men were so effusive in their praise of Carleton that they were sent home to prevent the desertion of other troops.|$|E
5|$|At 9:00pm three Guards regiments {{arrived on}} the scene. Although the troops {{assisted}} in crowd control, <b>their</b> <b>arrival</b> was also a reaction of the authorities to fears of a possible insurrection, for which the destruction of parliament could have signalled the first step. The three European revolutions of 1830—the French, Belgian and Polish actions—were still of concern, as were the unrest from the Captain Swing riots, and the recent passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which altered the relief provided by the workhouse system.|$|E
5|$|By February 1794 {{the still}} decommissioned, Marseillois had been renamed Vengeur du Peuple, {{probably}} {{a response to}} the participation of the city of Marseille in the Federalist revolts of 1793.

On 1 April 1794, she sailed to Île-d'Aix, where she joined up with Pelletier, and on 11 April, the squadron sailed on again, reaching Brest on 18 April, having been joined en route by Jemmapes. Upon <b>their</b> <b>arrival</b> the ships were assigned to the squadron under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a single server Markovian queue with {{two types of}} customers; positive and negative, where positive customers arrive in batches and arrivals of negative customers remove positive customers in batches.

50|$|AIK had {{a disappointing}} season, where the team {{did not win}} a single match {{in the wake of}} the sale of Brazilian star Wílton Figueiredo, {{dropping}} out of the title chase, missing European qualification in the process. Argentine recruits Iván Obolo and Lucas Valdemarín impressed upon <b>their</b> <b>arrivals,</b> forming an impressive unit with Figueiredo, which was curtailed when Al-Rayyan bought Figueiredo in September. The defense was arguably AIK's greatest asset, conceding just 28 goals, led by keeper Daniel Örlund and new talisman Nils-Eric Johansson.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} a Java framework for stochastic modelling and sim-ulation, {{used as an}} infrastructure to model and simulate real world activities, phe-nomena and processes, particularly in health care, patient monitoring and medical education. We modelled the flow of patients through medical units, considering both <b>their</b> <b>arrivals</b> and <b>their</b> stay in the hospital. Also, we implemented bootstrap-ping methods, which are quite useful in simulation studies. We created bootstrap-ping e-tools for simulating laboratory works and experiments, {{to be used in}} both didactic and research activities...|$|R
