5|$|The males arrive {{first and}} remain in the {{location}} for several weeks while the females only stay long enough <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> and spawn. Rather than fighting for the right <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> with a female, male toads may settle disputes {{by means of the}} pitch of their voice. Croaking provides a reliable sign of body size and hence of prowess. Nevertheless, fights occur in some instances. In a study at one pond where males outnumbered females by four or five to one, it was found that 38% of the males won the right <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> by defeating rivals in combat or by displacing other males already mounted on females. Male toads generally outnumber female toads at breeding ponds. A Swedish study found that female mortality was higher than that of males and that 41% of females did not come to the breeding pond in the spring and missed a year before reproducing again.|$|E
5|$|A further {{explanation}} is that females might prefer brighter males, so sexual selection could result in aposematic males having higher reproductive success than non-aposematic males if they can survive long enough <b>to</b> <b>mate.</b> Sexual selection {{is strong enough to}} allow seemingly maladaptive traits to persist despite other factors working against the trait.|$|E
5|$|After mating, {{the female}} washes her vulva thoroughly. If a male {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> {{with her at}} this point, the female will attack him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.|$|E

5|$|Bees {{are also}} mimicked by {{plants such as}} the bee orchid which imitates both the {{appearance}} and the scent of a female bee; male bees attempt <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> (pseudocopulation) with the furry lip of the flower, thus pollinating it.|$|E
5|$|Each {{year during}} the warmer months of September through December, male banded sea kraits gather on land and in the water around gently sloping areas at high tide. Males prefer <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> with larger females because they produce larger and more offspring.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature at {{seven to eight}} years old, and males at seven to 10 years. The {{beginning}} of a female's ovulation is {{a signal to the}} males that she is ready <b>to</b> <b>mate.</b> During ovulation, the skin of the female's anogenital area swells and turns a bright red/pink. The swelling makes it difficult to move and increases the female's chance of microbial or parasitic infection. Females with more swollen anogenital areas reproduce while younger, produce more offspring per year, and those offspring {{have a better chance of}} surviving. These females also attract more males, and are more likely to cause aggressive fights between them. Olive baboons tend <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> promiscuously. A male forms a mating consortship with an estrous female, staying close to and copulating with her. Males guard their partner against any other male trying <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> with her. Unless a female is in a multiday consortship, she often copulates with more than one male each day. Multiple copulations are not necessary for reproduction, but may function to make the actual paternity of the female's offspring ambiguous. This lack of paternal certainty could help reduce the occurrence of infanticide. Occasionally, male olive baboons monopolize a female for her entire period of probable conception. The male protects his female from being mated by other males during consortship.|$|E

5|$|Hawksbills evidently reach {{maturity}} after 20 years. Their lifespan is unknown. Like other sea turtles, hawksbills are solitary {{for most}} of their lives; they meet only <b>to</b> <b>mate.</b> They are highly migratory. Because of their tough carapaces, adults' only predators are sharks, estuarine crocodiles, octopuses, and some species of pelagic fish.|$|E
5|$|The adult {{stage is}} usually short, its {{function}} only <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> and lay eggs. The genitalia of female flies are rotated to a varying {{degree from the}} position found in other insects. In some flies, this is a temporary rotation during mating, but in others, it is a permanent torsion of the organs that occurs during the pupal stage. This torsion {{may lead to the}} anus being below the genitals, or, in the case of 360° torsion, to the sperm duct being wrapped around the gut and the external organs being in their usual position. When flies mate, the male initially flies on top of the female, facing in the same direction, but then turns around to face in the opposite direction. This forces the male to lie on his back for his genitalia to remain engaged with those of the female, or the torsion of the male genitals allows the male <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> while remaining upright. This leads to flies having more reproduction abilities than most insects, and much quicker. Flies occur in large populations due to their ability <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> effectively and quickly during the mating season.|$|E
5|$|The tammar wallaby has a {{promiscuous}} mating system. It is {{a seasonal}} breeder and births largely occur during late January and early February. During the breeding season, the male's prostate and bulbourethral gland enlarge. However, {{there does not}} appear to be any seasonal difference in the weight of the testes. Around two weeks before the first births, the males will begin sniffing the uro-genital openings and pouches of the females to determine their reproductive status. After giving birth, females enter estrus and allow males <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> with them. However, a male that attempts <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> with an estrous female may face aggression from other males. A male can achieve reproductive success by mate-guarding. During the estrous period, males establish a dominance hierarchy and the higher ranking males will try to prevent subordinates from mating with estrous females. Several males may pursue a single female.|$|E

5000|$|In {{an effort}} to study the ordered events of the cell cycle, Leland Hartwell et al. {{screened}} for and characterized temperature sensitive mutants, also known as cell division cycle mutants (cdc mutants), that display arrested cellular development at various stages of the cycle. Hartwell not only identified the mutant, cdc28, which arrests in very {{early stages of the}} cell cycle, but he also recognised that the presence of mating factors could result in similar phenotypes of inhibited bud formation and lack of DNA synthesis. Notably, cells that were exposed <b>to</b> <b>mating</b> factors at later stages of the cycle continued division, and only arrested when the resulting daughter cells reached the “early stages” (or more technically, the G1 phase) of the cell cycle. These results suggest that both cdc28 and mating pheromones mediate such early events, and further suggest that there exists a point in the cell cycle where the cell commits to division rather than <b>to</b> <b>mating.</b> Hartwell named this point “Start”, where cells are sensitive <b>to</b> <b>mating</b> pheromones prior <b>to</b> reaching this stage, but insensitive <b>to</b> <b>mating</b> factors afterwards.|$|R
40|$|During {{courtship}} males often communicate {{information about}} their fitness to females. The matching of harmonic components of flight tone in male-female pairs of flying mosquitoes, or harmonic convergence, was recently described. This behaviour occurs prior <b>to</b> <b>mating</b> and has been suggested <b>to</b> function in <b>mate</b> selection. We investigated the hypothesis that harmonic convergence is a component of mosquito courtship. A key prediction of this hypothesis is that harmonic convergence should provide information <b>to</b> potential <b>mates</b> about fitness benefits. We measured the effect of harmonic convergence behaviour on the direct and indirect benefits obtained by females. We found that the sons of pairs that converged at harmonic frequencies prior <b>to</b> <b>mating</b> had increased mating success and that these offspring were themselves more likely to converge prior <b>to</b> <b>mating.</b> These results suggest that males {{may be able to}} signal {{information about their}} genetic quality to females prior <b>to</b> <b>mating</b> and that this signal may be heritable. These findings are important for our understanding of mosquito behaviour and have applications in the control of mosquito-borne disease. This study also contributes to the study of male-female interactions and signal coevolution.

5|$|There is {{a direct}} {{competition}} between males to win {{the attention of the}} females in salamanders and newts, with elaborate courtship displays to keep the female's attention long enough to get her interested in choosing him <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> with.

5|$|Adults of {{most species}} of mole cricket can fly powerfully, if not with agility, but males do so infrequently. The females {{typically}} take wing soon after sunset, and {{are attracted to}} areas where males are calling, which they do {{for about an hour}} after sunset. This may be in order <b>to</b> <b>mate,</b> or they may be influenced by the suitability of the habitat for egg-laying, as demonstrated by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Although toads {{are usually}} solitary animals, in the {{breeding}} season, {{large numbers of}} toads converge on certain breeding ponds, where the males compete <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> with the females. Eggs are laid in gelatinous strings {{in the water and}} later hatch out into tadpoles. After several months of growth and development, these sprout limbs and undergo metamorphosis into tiny toads. The juveniles emerge from the water and remain largely terrestrial {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E

5|$|Among {{domestic}} cats, {{males are}} more likely to fight than females. Among feral cats, the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> with a female. In such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male. Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home. Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens. Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones.|$|E
5|$|California {{sea lions}} have a {{polygynous}} breeding pattern. From May to August, males establish territories {{and try to}} attract females with which <b>to</b> <b>mate.</b> Females are free to move in between territories, and are not coerced by males. Mothers nurse their pups in between foraging trips. Sea lions communicate with numerous vocalizations, notably with barks and mother-pup contact calls. Outside their breeding season, sea lions {{spend much of their}} time at sea, but they come to shore to molt.|$|E
5|$|Courtship {{is often}} aerial and often {{involves}} pheromones. Butterflies then {{land on the}} ground or on a perch <b>to</b> <b>mate.</b> Copulation takes place tail-to-tail and may last from minutes to hours. Simple photoreceptor cells located at the genitals are important for this and other adult behaviours. The male passes a spermatophore to the female; to reduce sperm competition, he may cover her with his scent, or in some species such as the Apollos (Parnassius) plugs her genital opening to prevent her from mating again.|$|E
25|$|Others {{have argued}} that the {{practice}} of traumatic insemination may have been an adaptation for males to circumvent female resistance <b>to</b> <b>mating</b> <b>to</b> eliminate courtship time, allowing one male <b>to</b> inseminate many <b>mates</b> when contact between them is brief; or that it evolved as a new development in the sperm competition as a means to deposit sperm as close to the ovaries as possible.|$|R

50|$|Fisher's {{hypothesis}} of runaway sexual selection suggests that female preference is genetically correlated with male traits {{and that the}} preference co-evolves with the evolution of that trait, thus the preference is under indirect selection. Fisher suggests that female preference began because the trait indicated the male’s quality. The female preference spread, so that the females’ offspring now benefited from the higher quality from specific trait but also greater attractiveness <b>to</b> <b>mates.</b> Eventually, the trait will only represent attractiveness <b>to</b> <b>mates</b> and no longer represent increased survival.|$|R
