50|$|In 1977 Han de Wit, an {{authorized}} pupil of the Kagyu lama Chogyam Trungpa, founded a centre in Amsterdam http://www.shambhala.nl which {{is engaged in}} teaching the Dharma and meditation according to Tibetan tradition. There is a smaller centre in Oegstgeest, also founded by de Wit, and groups in two other towns (Utrecht and Nijmegen). Other Karma Kagyu centres from different lineages have also sprung up, e.g. Naropa Institute in Cadzand, the locally famous Stupa temple in Hantum http://www.karmakagyu.nl/ and Diamond Way Buddhism (Ole Nydahl).The Tibetan Nyingma tradition is represented by several groups. They have a centre (Nyingma Centrum, Nederland) and a bookshop in Amsterdam. These groups belong to the organization of Tarthang Tulku who resides in California. The Gelugpa tradition (FPMT) is organized in the Maitreya Institute and owns a retreat centre in Loenen, Apeldoorn and a city centre in Amsterdam. The Maitreya Institute centres here {{are based on the}} initiative of Paula Koolkin in 1976. In August 1979 lama Thubten Yeshe and lama Zopa Rinpoche came to teach. By 2013 lama Geshe Sonam Gyaltsen and lama Sonam Ngodrup are the <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>permanent</b> residence. The Sakya tradition of Tibetan Buddhism took a foothold in 1976 as Geshe Lama Sherab Gyaltsen Amipa established the ‘Sakya Thegchen Ling’ in The Hague. Next to these four main schools there are also representations of more ecumenic and split-off Tibetan Groups. E.g. Rigpa from Sogyal Rinpoche, Dzogchen community from Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, the New Kadampa Tradition and the Jewel Heart affiliated with Gelek Rinpoche.|$|R
5000|$|De Ruyter {{was born}} in Vlissingen, the son of {{lieutenant}} admiral Michiel de Ruyter and his second wife Cornelia Engels. He began his naval service on board his father's ship on his expeditions in 1664 and 1665. Captains often had their sons serve with them, so that they learned their trade while their wages were paid by the Admiralty. In 1666, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, Engel was a midshipman in the Admiralty of Amsterdam. He served in the St. James's Day Battle on board Willem van der Zaen's ship, the Gouda. In 1667 he rose to lieutenant-commander. On 1 April 1668 he became captain-extraordinary and in 1669 a captain <b>in</b> ordinary, a <b>permanent</b> <b>post.</b> <b>In</b> 1670 he served under lieutenant-admiral Willem Joseph van Ghent in the expedition against the privateers of Algiers, receiving a reward for his service on that expedition.|$|R
50|$|After the Blackest Night is over, Ganthet is seen {{plotting}} with Atrocitus and Guy Gardner a new, universe-saving plan {{against a}} new, hidden foe. To further advance his new cause, Ganthet renounces his Guardian status, requesting his fellow Oans to fill <b>in</b> the <b>permanent</b> <b>post</b> of Green Lantern of Sector 0, forging his own lantern and power {{ring in the}} process. Notably, his new Power Battery lacks the ordinary, rounder design, and looks much similar to the squared, older ones once wielded by the Manhunters and the Halla's. He was later forced to assist Hank Henshaw, who has learned from the hidden foe that Ganthet is apparently the key to Henshaw's permanent death. By threatening to make the Alpha Lanterns kill themselves if Ganthet does not cooperate, Henshaw made Ganthet operate several Alpha Lanterns to try and restore them to organic life-forms, believing that the process, once perfected, {{can be used to}} return him to a mortal body. During the process some Alpha Lanterns perished. Ganthet experiences great grief at the death of these Green Lanterns, emotions he is not quite familiar with. Ganthet is rescued by a squad of Lanterns and Hank Henshaw's form and spirit is destroyed. Afterward, all the Alpha Lanterns have their free will restored, thanks to Ganthet. Sadly, they must keep their cyborg appearances.|$|R

As the fur trade diminished and the population grew, the post became a general store, trading merchandise to supply lumbermen.
