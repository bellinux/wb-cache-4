25|$|The driverless tractor is {{considered}} controversial {{in terms of}} safety and public acceptance. A tractor operating without a driver makes some people nervous. Creating technology that stays safe in all scenarios where failure could possibly occur <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> programming and time. In terms of motion detection, the tractors have sensors to stop them if they detect objects in their path such as people, animals, vehicles or other large objects. In 2004, researchers from the Danish Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University published a paper in which they examined {{the safety of a}} driverless tractor in detail. With their driverless tractor, they had one person designated as a safety operator. This operator controlled a switch which could immediately shut down and halt the tractor. They also wired four emergency stop switches on each corner of the tractor.|$|E

500|$|The lunge-feeders are the rorquals. To feed, lunge-feeders {{expand the}} volume of their jaw to a volume bigger than the {{original}} volume of the whale itself; to do this, the mouth inflates to expand the mouth. The inflation of the mouth causes the throat pleats to expand, {{increasing the amount of}} water that the mouth can store. Just before they ram the baitball, the jaw swings open at almost a 90° angle and bends which lets in more water. To prevent stretching the mouth too far, rorquals have a sensory organ located {{in the middle of the}} jaw to regulate these functions. Then they must decelerate. This process <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> mechanical work, and is only energy-effective when used against a large baitball. The skim-feeders, are right whales, gray whales, pygmy right whales, and sei whales (which also lunge feed). To feed, skim-feeders swim with an open mouth, filling it with water and prey. Prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale's interest, be within a certain size range so that the baleen plates can filter it, and be slow enough so that it cannot escape. The [...] "skimming" [...] may take place on the surface, underwater, or even at the ocean's bottom, indicated by mud occasionally observed on right whales' bodies. Gray whales feed primarily on the ocean's bottom, feeding on benthic creatures.|$|E

Robert Aramayo (young Eddard Stark) spoke about the filming of the scene in an interview following the airing of the episode and stated, [...] "We all went through a bunch of training, which continued through our three- or four-day shoot in Spain.

Likewise, in a fight, if you're going to chop somebody's arm off or stab them in the gut — the intention is to chop that arm off or stab someone in the gut, and you have to play that intention fully.
