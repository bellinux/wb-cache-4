5|$|<b>The</b> <b>nuclear</b> envelope's {{structure}} {{is determined by}} a network of intermediate filaments (protein filaments). This network is organized into lining similar to mesh called <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> lamina, which binds to chromatin, integral membrane proteins, and other nuclear components along the inner surface of the nucleus. <b>The</b> <b>nuclear</b> lamina is thought to help materials inside the nucleus reach <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> pores and in the disintegration of <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> envelope during mitosis and its reassembly {{at the end of}} the process.|$|E
5|$|At {{a certain}} point during the cell cycle in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new {{daughter}} cells must have {{a full set of}} genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids in the presence of <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> envelope. Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase, <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the CDC2 protein kinase. Towards the end of the cell cycle, <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> membrane is reformed, and around the same time, <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.|$|E
5|$|However, in dinoflagellates, <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> {{envelope}} remains intact, the centrosomes {{are located}} in the cytoplasm, and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions are incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> envelope (the so-called closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle). In many other protists (e.g., ciliates, sporozoans) and fungi, the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemble during cell division.|$|E

5|$|In animal cells, two {{networks}} of intermediate filaments provide the nucleus with mechanical support: <b>The</b> <b>nuclear</b> lamina forms an organized meshwork {{on the internal}} face of the envelope, while less organized support is provided on the cytosolic face of the envelope.

5|$|In most cells, the {{disassembly}} of <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> envelope {{marks the}} end of the prophase of mitosis. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed mitosis, in which <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by breakdown of <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.|$|E

5|$|Cell nuclei contain {{most of the}} cell's genetic material, {{organized}} as multiple long linear DNA molecules in complex with a large variety of proteins, such as histones, to form chromosomes. The genes within these chromosomes are the cell's nuclear genome and are structured {{in such a way}} to promote cell function. The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression—the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up the nucleus are <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> envelope, a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm, and <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> matrix (which includes <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> lamina), a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the cytoskeleton, which supports the cell as a whole.|$|E
