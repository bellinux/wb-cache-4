5000|$|When a MOSFET is {{used for}} the lower switch, {{additional}} losses may occur during the time between the turn-off of the high-side switch and the turn-on of the low-side switch, when the body diode of the low-side MOSFET conducts the output current. This time, known as the non-overlap time, prevents [...] "shootthrough", a condition in which both switches are simultaneously turned on. The onset of shootthrough generates severe power loss and heat. Proper selection of non-overlap time must balance the risk of shootthrough with the increased power loss caused by conduction of the body diode. Many MOSFET based buck converters also include a diode to aid the lower MOSFET body diode with conduction during the non-overlap time. When a diode is used exclusively for the lower switch, diode forward <b>turn-on</b> <b>time</b> can reduce efficiency and lead to voltage overshoot.|$|E

The {{results show that the}} <b>turn-on</b> <b>time</b> delay significantly reduces by increasing the injection current (I-inj) and/or the initial value of carrier density (N-i). Meanwhile, the <b>turn-on</b> <b>time</b> delay increases by increasing the CRR coefficients. However, its effect can be minimized by increasing I-inj and/or N-i. In addition, the <b>turn-on</b> <b>time</b> delay can be reduced by increasing the external optical feedback (OFB) level. Moreover, it is shown that the optimum external-cavity length (L-ext) is 3. 1 cm. Furthermore, an antireflection (AR) coating reflectivity value of 1 X 10 (- 2) is sufficient for the laser to operate at good <b>turn-on</b> <b>time</b> delay and low fabrication complexity. The obtained results can provide an important idea for the practical fabrication of the FGFP laser used in the dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) systems and optical access networks...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the development of cyclometallated iridium(III) complexes for application in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) and highlights the ligand-design strategies employed to enhance device stability, operating efficiency and (critically for LECs in which the ion mobilities are typically low) <b>turn-on</b> <b>times.</b> Typical iridium-containing ionic transtion metal complexes (Ir-iTMCs) belong to the family of [Ir(C^N) 2 (N^N) ] + complexes in which H(C^N) is a cyclometallating ligand and N^N is a diimine or related chelating ligand. The partitioning of Ir/C^N vs N^N character in the HOMO and LUMO of a [Ir(C^N) 2 (N^N) ] + complex, respectively, lends itself to a ligand-functionalization driven method of varying the band-gap allowing emission-colour tuning. An important development in addressing device stability has been the design of ligands that can protect the iridium(III) centre through intra-cation π-stacking interactions, and progress in this area is discussed in detail. The need for deep-blue emitters has been addressed by introducing fluoro-substituents into the cyclometallating domain; however this can lead to lower stability of the LECs and alternative means of shifting the emission into the blue are discussed. Finally, we discuss how a move away from singly-charged, cationic Ir-iTMCs can be used to shorten the <b>turn-on</b> <b>times</b> of LEC...|$|R

Synthesis, photophysical and electrochemical studies of these complexes are reported.

40|$|This report {{covers the}} fiscal year 1999 portion of our ongoing project to develop tracer {{spectral}} diagnostics of ablator conditions in the hohlraum radiation environment. The overall goal of the experimental campaign is to measure the <b>turn-on</b> <b>times</b> of K{sub a} absorption features from tracers buried in planar witness plates. The tracers are thin and at a specific, known depth in the witness plates so that the <b>turn-on</b> <b>times</b> are indicators of {{the arrival of the}} Marshak wave at the specified depths. Ultimately, we intend to compare the delay in the <b>turn-on</b> <b>times</b> of the tracer signals between doped and undoped ablator materials, and thus study the effect of ablator dopants on the Marshak wave velocity. During FY 1999, our primary goal was to simply measure an absorption signal, matching tracer depth to drive temperature and testing the overall feasibility of our experimental scheme. In indirect-drive inertial confinement fusion (ICF) energy is deposited rapidly on the outside of a spherical capsule, ablating the outer layers of the capsule and compressing the interior. If this process is carefully controlled, then hydrogen fuel {{at the center of the}} capsule can be compressed and heated such that fusion reactions may proceed. The efficiency of the compression depends crucially on the time-dependent energy deposition onto the ablator material on the outside of the capsule. The nature of this coupling can be controlled through the use of ablator dopants, which modify the density and opacity of the ablator layer. Clearly, it is crucial to the success of indirect-drive ICF to have a means for testing the effects of ablator dopants, and more generally for having a diagnostic that is capable of determining time-dependent ablator properties. To this end, we are adapting tracer spectroscopy techniques to make time-dependent measurements of the ionization state of planar ablator materials mounted on the sides of hohlraums. Specifically, we are doing backlighter point-projection spectroscopy of K{sub a} features from tracers placed in the interiors of planar witness plates made of ablator materials. As the radiation wave, or Marshak wave, diffuses into the ablator material it drives a shock ahead of it. When the shock arrives at a given point in the witness plate it heats the tracer to roughly 20 eV. Soon after, the radiation wave arrives, heating the tracer to well above 100 eV nearly instantaneously. Thus, the ''turn-on'' of tracer absorption from high ionization states is an indicator that the radiation wave has arrived at the tracer. Furthermore, the time-dependent ionization balance in the tracer is, our simulations show, indicative of the efficiency with which the radiation field couples to the ablator material. Note that this technique holds out the possibility of making a determination of the instantaneous impact of the radiation field on the ablator physics, as opposed to something like a shock breakout measurement, in which the observed signal reflects the integrated time-history of the impact of the radiation field on the ablator...|$|R

LEC devices based on these archetype complexes exhibit long turn-on times (70 and 160 h, respectively) and low external quantum efficiencies (~ 2 %) when the complex is used as a pure film. The long turn-on times are attributed to the low mobility of the counterions. The performance of the devices dramatically improves when small amounts of ionic liquids (ILs) are added to the Ir-iTMC: the <b>turn-on</b> <b>time</b> improves drastically (from hours to minutes) and the device current and power efficiency increase by almost one order of magnitude. However, the improvement of the <b>turn-on</b> <b>time</b> is unfortunately accompanied by a decrease in the stability of the device from 700 h to a few hours.

It is also demonstrated that this 'wobble' can be utilized to explain why the turn-ons of Hercules X- 1 preferentially occur around orbital phases 0. 2 and 0. 7.

By {{working in the}} time domain, we determined {{the motion of the}} magnetic moment throughout the process of spin-transfer–driven switching, and we measured <b>turn-on</b> <b>times</b> of steady-state precessional modes. Time-resolved studies of magnetic relaxa-tion allow for the direct measurement of magnetic damping in a nanomagnet and prove that this damping can be controlled electrically using spin-polarized currents. Spin-polarized electrons traversing a ferro-magnet can transfer spin-angular momentum to the local magnetization, thereby applying a torque that may produce magnetic reversal or steady-state precession (1, 2). This spin-transfer mechanism allows nanomagnets to be manipulated without magnetic fields, and it is the subject of extensive research for ap-plications in nonvolatile memory, programma-ble logic, and microwave oscillators (3 – 11). However, the gigahertz-scale magnetic dy-namics that can be driven by spin transfer have previously been measured using only frequency-domain techniques (12 – 16). Here we report direct time-resolved studies of dy-namics excited by spin-transfer torques. By working in the time domain, we are able to characterize the full time-dependent magnetic response to pulses of spin-polarized currents, including transient dynamics. These measure-ments allow a direct view of the process of spin-transfer–driven magnetic reversal, and they determine the possible operating speeds for practical spin-transfer devices. The re-sults provide rigorous tests of theoretical mod-els for spin transfer (1, 9, 17 – 19) and strongly support the spin-torque model (1, 18) over competing theories that invoke magnetic heat-ing (9, 20).

The electroluminescence spectra show slight blueshifts with repect to the photoluminscence bands. LEC <b>turn-on</b> <b>times</b> vary from instantaneous for N?N = 2 to 2 h for N?N = 1. The device data suggest that the incorporation of Br substituents into the N?N co-ligand may not be beneficial...|$|R
40|$|Imidazolium ionic side-group-containing fluorene-based {{conjugated}} polyelectrolytes (CPEs) {{with different}} π-conjugated structures, poly[(9, 9 -bis(8 '-(3 ″-methyl- 1 ″-imidazolium) octyl) - 2, 7 -fluorene) -alt- 2, 7 -(9, 9 -dioctylfluorene) ] dibromide (F 8 im-Br) and poly[(9, 9 -bis(8 '-(3 ″-methyl- 1 ″-imidazolium) octyl) - 2, 7 -fluorene) -alt-(benzo(2, 1, 3) thiadiazol- 4, 8 -diyl) dibromide (F 8 imBT-Br), are synthesized and utilized as an electron injection layer (EIL) in green-emitting F 8 BT polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs). Both CPE EIL devices significantly outperform Ca cathode devices; 17. 9 cd A(- 1) (at 3. 8 V) and 16. 6 lm W(- 1) (at 3. 0 V) for F 8 imBT-Br devices, 11. 1 cd A(- 1) (at 4. 2 V) and 9. 1 lm W(- 1) (at 3. 4 V) for F 8 im-Br devices, and 7. 2 cd A(- 1) (at 3. 6 V) and 7. 0 lm W(- 1) (at 3. 0 V) for Ca devices. Importantly, unlike the F 8 im-Br EIL devices, F 8 imBT-Br PLEDs exhibit much faster electroluminescence <b>turn-on</b> <b>times</b> (< 10 μs) despite both EILs possessing the same tethered imidazolium and mobile bromide ions. The F 8 imBT-Br devices represent, {{to the best}} of our knowledge, the highest efficiency in thin (70 nm) single-layer F 8 BT PLEDs in conventional device architecture with the fastest EL response time using CPE EIL with mobile ions. Our results clearly indicate the importance of an additional factor of EIL materials, specifically the conjugated backbone structure, to determine the device efficiency and response times...|$|R
