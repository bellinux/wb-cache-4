5|$|If an {{individual}} feels Vairagya (detachment from the world), the Jabala Upanishad maintains that no preconditions apply, {{and the individual}} has the spiritual right <b>to</b> <b>renounce</b> immediately. This principle in the Jabala Upanishad was cited by medieval-era scholars such as Adi Shankara, Vijñāneśvara, Sureśvara, and Nilakantha as the Vedic basis that makes renunciation {{an individual}} choice and right. This choice {{has been referred to}} as a Vikalpa by the later scholars, which the society and state must respect. The Jabala Upanishad concurred with some Dharmasastras on the right <b>to</b> <b>renounce</b> and lead a monastic life, but its views contradicted others such as those in Manusmriti verses 6.35–37. The text fed a debate on the right of the individual, and medieval Hindu scholars relied on and sided with the Jabala Upanishad.|$|E
