He proceeded to Calcutta, and alleging that Purnananda Burhagohain was subverting the Ahom Government and ruining the country, endeavored to persuade the Governor-General Lord Hastings to dispatch an expedition against Purnananda Burhagohain. Lord Hasting, however, refused to interfere in any way. Meanwhile Badan Chandra had stuck up a friendship with the Calcutta Agent of the Burmese government and he went with <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> the Court of Amarapura, where he was accorded an interview with the Burmese king, Bodawpaya. He repeated his misrepresentations regarding the conduct of Purnananda Burhagohain, alleging that he had usurped the King's authority, and that owing to his misgovernment, the lives of all, both high and low, were in danger. At last he obtained a promise of help. Towards {{the end of the year}} 1816 an army of about eight thousand men under the command of General Maha Minhla Minkhaung was dispatch from Burma with Badan Chandra Borphukan. It was joined en route by the chiefs of Mungkong, Hukong and Manipur, and, by the time Namrup was reached, its number had swollen to about sixteen thousand. Purnananda Burhagohain sent an army to oppose the invaders. A battle was fought at Ghiladhari in which the Assamese army was routed. At this juncture Purnananda Burhagohain died or some say, committed suicide by swallowing diamonds, leaving the entire Ahom government leaderless. His eldest son, Ruchinath was appointed as Burhagohain. The Ahom war council decided to continue the war; and a fresh army was hastily equipped and sent to resist the Burmese. Like the former one, it was utterly defeated, near Kathalbari east of Dihing. The Burmese continued their advance pillaging and burning the villages along their line of march. Ruchinath Burhagohain endeavored in vain to induce the reigning Ahom monarch Chandrakanta Singha to retreat to Guwahati, and then, perceiving that the latter intended to sacrifice him, in order to conciliate Badan Chandra and his Burmese allies, fled westwards to Guwahati.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode of}} The Simpsons {{featured}} multiple references to animation and Hollywood. Pixar is referenced in the episode as [...] "Mixar". In the 1999 {{era of the}} studio {{you can hear the}} song [...] "Bye Bye Bye" [...] by NSYNC. The short film Condiments serves as a parody of the Pixar film Toy Story, and the song [...] "You've Got an Enemy" [...] (sung by Castellaneta impersonating Randy Newman) references [...] "You've Got a Friend in Me". Willis and Crumble parodies Wallace and Gromit, and uses the same style of stop-motion animation. Nick Park, the creator of Wallace and Gromit, has a voice cameo as himself. Multiple other short film fragments further lampooned other movies including The Triplets of Belleville and Persepolis. The episode also references Ricky Gervais's controversial hosting stunt at the 68th Golden Globe Awards, with a sign featuring a picture of him alongside a caption reading [...] "Do Not Allow <b>This</b> <b>Man</b> <b>To</b> Host".|$|E

2500|$|Attributed to P. F. Strawson is the performative {{theory of}} truth {{which holds that}} to say [...] "'Snow is white' is true" [...] is to perform the speech act of {{signaling}} one's agreement with the claim that snow is white (much like nodding one's head in agreement). The idea that some statements are more actions than communicative statements is not as odd as it may seem. Consider, for example, that when the bride says [...] "I do" [...] {{at the appropriate time}} in a wedding, she is performing the act of taking <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> be her lawful wedded husband. She is not describing herself as taking this man, but actually doing so (perhaps the most thorough analysis of such [...] "illocutionary acts" [...] is J. L. Austin, [...] "How to Do Things With Words").|$|E
