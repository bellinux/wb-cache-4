Rainbow <b>trout</b> (<b>N</b> 5 134) longer than 440 mm were implanted with radio transmitters and tracked for varying periods fromJuly 1997 to April 1999. Fifty-eight radio-tagged fish were tracked for sufficient duration (at least 11 months) to allow description of seasonal migratory patterns. Unique seasonal movements offish suggested discrete, within-basin population structure. Telemetry data documented theexistence of multiple migratory and nonmigratory groups of rainbow trout, indicating unique lifehistory patterns. The observed groups consisted of what we defined as a lake-resident ecotype, alake-river ecotype, and a riverine ecotype; the riverine ecotype demonstrated both highlymigratory and nonmigratory movement behaviour. Considerable variation in movement patternswas found within both the lake–river group and the river migratory group. Radio-tagged trout didnot migrate between the two Alagnak watershed lakes in either year of the study, suggesting lakefidelity in the population structure.

The spawning migration of sea trout (Salmo trutta) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) was studied in the River Tweed, UK, using acoustic telemetry to complement exploitation rate data and to quantify catchment penetration. Salmon (n = 79) and sea <b>trout</b> (<b>n</b> = 65) were tagged in the tidal-influenced Tweed in summer–autumn. No tagged salmon left the river before spawning, but 3 % (2010) and 8 % (2011) of pre-spawning sea trout dropped out. Combined tag regurgitation/fish mortality in salmon was 12. 5 %, while trout mortality was 6 % (2010) and 0 % (2011).

We evaluated the combined effects of fasting ({{measured in}} degree-days, °C d), preceded by intermittent feeding {{in the last month}} of production, on the flesh quality rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). <b>Trout</b> (<b>n</b> = 240) were fed the same total amount of food either daily (D), once every two days (2 D) or once every four days (4 D) for one month, and then fasted for 24. 3 °C d (2 days) or 102 °C d (9 days). There was a significant interaction between the effects of intermittent feeding and pre-slaughter fasting for most of the parameters measured. Slaughter weight was higher in 2 D and 4 D trout after two days of fasting, probably since they had more feed in their stomachs. Muscle glycogen and the hepato-somatic index were also higher in 2 D trout after 2 days of fasting, suggesting higher energy reserves. There was no interaction between the effects of intermittent feeding and fasting on final muscle pH which was higher after 9 days of fasting, indicating poorer flesh quality. Overall, the results suggest that trout that received a skip-a-day feeding schedule one month before slaughter, adapt better to a two day fast than trout fed daily or once every four days...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{relative}} importance of migratory corridors and seasonally important feeding habitats in relation to bull trout size. An understanding of size-related habitat use and migratory behavior is particularly important for managing bull trout in highly manipulated reservoir systems. I used radio telemetry to determine size related patterns of autumn migration during 2001 - 2003 in the Boise River and Arrowrock Reservoir in southwestern Idaho. Downstream migrating bull <b>trout</b> (<b>n</b> = 158, 21 - 73 cm TL) captured in the autumn at a picket weir on the North Fork Boise River were implanted with radio transmitters.

Probability of migration to the reservoir increased with fish body length. Bull trout captured later in the season had a lower probability of migrating to Arrowrock reservoir. Migration rate (km/day) increased with fish length. Stream temperature was not significantly related to migration rate.

All redband <b>trout</b> (<b>N</b> � 23) were con sistently relocated in a stream reach with moderate gradient (2. 3 %) {{near the site of}} original capture. Some fish (N � 13) displayed sedentary behavior, whereas others were mobile (N � 10). The mean total distance moved during the study for all fish combined was 64 m (SD � 105 m; range, 0 – 362 m), and the mean home range from October through December was 67 m (SD � 99 m; range, 5 – 377 m). Thirteen redband trout made short upstream and downstream movements (mean total movement � 134 m; range, 8 – 362 m) that were related to habitat use. Mobile fish commonly migrated to complex pools that spanned the entire channel width (primary pools). Eight of 10 fish that did not change habitat location occupied primary pools, whereas the remaining 2 fish occupied lateral pools. Fish commonly overwintered in primary pools dominated by cobble and boulder substrates that contained large woody debris.

40|$|This paper investigates {{spatially}} cued behavioural {{responses of}} {{two species of}} fish to an acute noxious stimulus and demonstrates response elasticity. Typical avoidance responses to a nociceptive stimulus were used to test (1) if fish learn to avoid spatial areas associated with a potentially noxious stimulus, (2) learning and memory improves with increased stimulus intensity and (3) a supposedly innate reflex behavioural responses change depending on the circumstances. Electric shocks with two different intensities, low (2. 5 V and 3 V for trout and goldfish, respectively) and high (25 V and 30 V for trout and goldfish, respectively), were administered directly to the skin to stimulate cutaneous nociceptors. Goldfish (n = 8) demonstrated spatially cued shock avoidance {{and an increase in}} stimulus voltage, significantly improved shock-avoidance learning and memory. However, <b>trout</b> (<b>n</b> = 8) demonstrated shock-avoidance learning but no significant stimulus discrimination and little information retention. The presence of a conspecific significantly changed this behavioural response to a noxious stimulus. Trout were willing to remain {{in the vicinity of the}} conspecific while being subjected to low intensity shock stimuli previously shown to elicit avoidance. Goldfish tended to leave this area yet remain in the mid-tank area, adjacent to the stimulating zone, rather than at the end of the tank. These results suggest that shock avoidance in fish is not purely a reflex action. Fish were prepared to change the supposedly innate avoidance reaction according to a change in circumstances, an important concept in the ongoing debate on pain perception in fish.

Information was recorded on individual rainbow <b>trout</b> (<b>n</b> = 415) captured by angling including landing {{time and the}} time required to remove hooks (angling duration), the time to anesthetize fish in clove oil and withdraw blood, fish length and weight, and water temperature at capture locations. Plasma cortisol, glucose, ions (sodium, potassium, chloride), and lactate were analyzed {{to determine the effects of}} angling duration, fish size, body condition, and temperature. Levels of plasma ions did not change significantly during the observed physiological response and levels of plasma glucose were sometimes influenced by length (2000, 2001), body condition (2001), or temperature (2001). Levels of plasma cortisol and lactate in extended capture fish (angling duration greater than 2 min) were significantly higher than levels in rapid capture fish (angling duration less than 2 min). Rapid capture fish were significantly smaller than extended capture fish, reflecting that fish size influenced landing and handling times. Fish size was related to cortisol and lactate in 2002, which corresponded to the year when larger fish were captured and there were longer landing times. Body condition (i. e., weight/length regression residuals index), was significantly related to lactate in 2000 and 2001. Water temperatures were higher in 2001 (mean temperature ± S.

Sperm from each MMS exposed and control fish was then used to fertilize in vitro an aliquot of a single pool of eggs collected from 4 unexposed females for each species. Each batch of fertilized eggs was monitored individually in the hatchery to follow embryonic and larval abnormalities during the fry development. Paternal exposure did not influence fertilization rate or survival rate at hatching in either species. However, MMS paternal treatment resulted in a large array of morphological abnormalities during embryonic and larval development. At the eyed stage, malformations exhibited a 8 fold increase in trout and a 2 fold increase in charr for larvae stemming from MMS treated males as compared with controls. At the end of yolk sac resorption, an increase in the gross morphological abnormality incidence was found in trout larvae originating from MMS exposed males (2. 10 % vs. 0. 93 % in control, p < 0. 05). When looking more in detail at bony structures after Alizarin red S staining, a 20 % incidence of skeletal defects was recorded at the swimming stage. A positive correlation was found between the paternal sperm DNA damage level and the skeletal abnormality incidence of its progeny. During the next 2 months of development, mortality in trout originating from DNA damaged sperm was 3 times higher than in control. After one year, no effect of paternal treatment was found on growth traits (length and weight) but the gross morphological abnormality incidence was still very high in the treated group (27 % malformation incidence vs. 0. 5 % in control). These results demonstrate ecologically relevant consequences of fish spermatozoa DNA damage and stress the value of using this parameter as a biomarker signaling potential long term effects of environmental genotoxins in aquatic systems...|$|R
40|$|In {{temperate}} regions, {{environmental conditions}} vary distinctly between seasons. This variation can strongly impact in-stream environmental conditions. Winter is often {{thought to be}} harsher than other seasons for stream fishes, given the adverse environmental conditions that arise from low temperatures during winter in temperate regions. Low temperatures, episodic elevated discharge, and ice formation associated with winter are hypothesized to reduce movement, body condition, and survival of stream fishes. However, few studies test this hypothesis through formal comparisons, and most studies of seasonal stream fish ecology focus on salmonids. To address this knowledge gap, I estimated and compared body condition, net displacement rates, and apparent survival of two common stream fishes in summer and winter. I conducted my study in Stegman Creek, a small coldwater stream in west Michigan. My study species were mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdii), a small-bodied benthic fish, and brown trout (Salmo trutta), a largerbodied, drift-feeding fish. Over two 7 -week periods (July-September 2016, January-March 2017), I individually marked mottled sculpin (n = 352) and brown <b>trout</b> (<b>n</b> = 329) with passive integrated transponder tags, and recaptured tagged individuals via weekly backpack electrofishing surveys. Both species exhibited different responses to seasonal environmental changes. Mottled sculpin net displacement rates significantly declined in winter, while body condition and apparent survival probability increased. The magnitude {{of the increase in}} condition was small, and likely resulted from spring spawning preparation. Increased apparent survival may have resulted from reduced emigration of mottled sculpin, or reduced predation risk from large brown trout. Body condition and net displacement rates of brown trout remained stable between seasons. Models suggested apparent survival of brown trout was length-dependent in summer and time-dependent in winter. Periods of low apparent survival of brown trout in winter corresponded with extreme low and high water temperatures. My results suggest winter was not particularly harsh for mottled sculpin or brown trout in Stegman Creek, although brown trout apparent survival appeared to be negatively influenced by variable winter water temperatures. These findings suggest seasonal effects may be context-dependent, and are likely to vary among stream systems and fish species...|$|R

A similar karyotype has been found, for trout from the Deschutes River and summer-run steelhead from the Siletz and Clearwater rivers. The chromosomal and distributional data is believed to indicate a widespread golden trout complex composed of the red-band trout, the California golden trout, and the Kern River trout inhabiting the Pacific Coast drainage from British Columbia to southern California.

40|$|Several {{inorganic}} substances (e. g., C£, Mg, Ca, H) are potent negative modulators of hemoglobin-oxygen affinity. To evaluate {{the possibility that}} potentially adaptive changes in the red cell ionic environment of hemoglobin may take place during acclimation of fishes to increased environmental temperature, hematological status (hemoglobin, hematocrit, red cell numbers, mean erythrocytic volume and hemoglobin content), plasma + + 2 + 2 + and packed red cell electrolyte levels (Na, K, Ca, Mg, C£) were evaluated in summer and winter populations of the stenothermal rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri, following acclimation to 2 °, 10 °, 18 °C, and in a spring population of eurythermal carp, Cyprinus carpio, held at 2 °, 16 ° and 30 °C. From these data cell ion concentrations and ion:hemoglobin ratios were estimated. In view {{of the role of}} red cell carbonic anhydrase in the reductions of blood C 02 tensions and the recruitment of Na and C£~ lost by fishes, a preliminary investigation of thermoacclimatory changes in the activity of this system in rainbow trout erythrocytes was conducted. Few changes in hematological status were encountered following acclimation. There was, however, some evidence of weight-specific differential hematological response in carp. This lead to markedly greater increases in hemoglobin, hematocrit and red cell numbers in smaller rather than in larger specimens at higher temperatures; variations which were 2 + well correlated with changes in plasma Ca. Plasma composition in summer trout was not altered by acclimation. In winter trout plasma Na and K increased at higher temperatures. Carp were characterized by increases in plasma calcium, and reductions in sodium and magnesium under these conditions. Several significant seasonal differences in plasma ion levels were observed in the <b>trout.</b> (<b>n)</b> In <b>trout,</b> only erythrocytic K and K :Hb were altered by acclimation, rising at higher temperatures. In carp Na, Na :Hb, C£~ and C£~:Hb in- 2 + 2 + creased with temperature, while Mg and Mg :Hb declined. Changes in overall ionic composition in carp red cells were consistent with increases in H content. In both species significant reciprocal variations in C£~ 2 + - + and Mg were found. In mammalian systems increases in C£ and H reduce hemoglobin-oxygen affinity by interaction with hemoglobin. Reduction in 2 + 2 + Mg maximizes organophosphate modulator availability by decreasing ATP»Mg complex formation. Thus, the changes observed may be of adaptive value in reducing hemoglobin-oxygen affinity, and facilitating oxygen release to cells at higher temperatures. Trout appear to maintain a high chloridelow magnesium state over the entire thermal tolerance zone. Carp, however, achieved this state only at higher temperatures. In both species mean erythrocytic volume was decreased at higher temperatures and this may facilitate branchial oxygen loading. Since mean erythrocytic volume was inversely related to red cell ion content, it is hypothesized that reductions in cell volume are achieved by export of some unidentified solute or solutes. Variations in the carbonic anhydrase activity that could be attributed to the thermoacclimatory process were quite modest. On the other hand, assays performed at the temperature of acclimation showed a large temperature effect where under in vivo conditions of temperature fish acclimated to higher temperatures might be expected to have higher activities. Furthermore, since hematocrit increased with temperature in these fish, while carbonic anhydrase is present only in the erythrocyte, the whole blood levels of this enzyme are expected to increase and further augment the temperature effect. This, in turn, could aid in the reduction of C 02 (111) tension and increase the production of H and HC 0 ~~ used in the active uptake of Na and C£ at higher temperatures...|$|R

We illustrate the use of a multi-method scheme {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} ‘nature-like’ connectivity restoration for stream fish communities in the River Deerness, NE England. Electric-fishing, capture-mark-recapture, PIT telemetry and radio-telemetry were used to measure fish community composition, dispersal, fishway efficiency and upstream migration respectively. For measuring passage and dispersal, our rationale was to evaluate a wide size range of strong swimmers (exemplified by brown trout Salmo trutta) and weak swimmers (exemplified by bullhead Cottus perifretum) in situ in the stream ecosystem. Radio-tracking of adult trout during the spawning migration showed that passage efficiency at each of five connectivity-restored sites was 81. 3 – 100 %. Unaltered (experimental control) structures on the migration route had a bottle-neck effect on upstream migration, especially during low flows. However, even during low flows, displaced PIT tagged juvenile <b>trout</b> (total <b>n</b> = 153) exhibited a passage efficiency of 70. 1 – 93. 1 % at two nature-like passes. In mark-recapture experiments juvenile brown trout and bullhead tagged (total n = 5303) succeeded in dispersing upstream more often at most structures following obstacle modification, but not at the two control sites, based on a Laplace kernel modelling approach of observed dispersal distance and barrier traverses. Medium-term post-restoration data (2 – 3 years) showed that the fish assemblage remained similar at five of six connectivity-restored sites and two control sites, but at one connectivity-restored headwater site previously inhabited by trout only, three native non-salmonid species colonized. We conclude that stream habitat reconnection should support free movement of a wide range of species and life stages, wherever retention of such obstacles is not needed to manage non-native invasive species.

Pubertal autumn-spawning seawater-raised female rainbow <b>trout</b> were rested (<b>n</b> = 10) or swum (n = 10) for 1176 km at 0. 75 body-lengths per second in a 6, 000 -L swim-flume under reproductive conditions for 40 days. Red and white muscle RNA of exercised and non-exercised fish (4 lanes) was sequenced and resulted in 15 – 17 million reads per lane that, after de novo assembly, yielded 149, 159 red and 118, 572 white muscle contigs. Most contigs were annotated using an iterative homology search strategy against salmonid ESTs, the zebrafish Danio rerio genome and general Metazoan genes. When selecting for large contigs (> 500 nucleotides), a number of novel rainbow trout gene sequences were identified in this study: 1, 085 and 1, 228 novel gene sequences for red and white muscle, respectively, which included {{a number of important}} molecules for skeletal muscle function. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that sustained swimming increased transcriptional activity in skeletal muscle and specifically an up-regulation of genes involved in muscle growth and developmental processes in white muscle.

The feeding trial lasted 12 weeks at a water temperature of 17 °C. Dietary intake, apparent digestibility and initial and final whole-body composition data were used to calculate mineral gain which was regressed against digestible mineral intake (both expressed as mg or µg kg- 0. 8 day- 1). Starvation loss (SL), endogenous loss of fed fish (ELF, y-intercept at x = 0) and point of intake for zero balance (PZB, x-intercept at y = 0) were used as estimates of maintenance requirements. SL provided the lowest estimate, ELF provided the net requirement of a mineral for maintenance and PZB provided the digestible dietary intake required to meet maintenance (SL <ELF <PZB). Dietary ingredient composition did not significantly affect the digestible mineral supply required for maintenance (PZB) {{for any of the}} minerals (P, Mg, K, Cu and Zn) studied. However, ELF of micro-minerals such as Cu and Zn were significantly affected. The ELF of Cu was significantly lower and that of Zn was significantly higher in V group compared with M-fed fish.

We recorded fish focal points and measured {{a set of}} habitat characteristics as well as habitat availability via line transects. Bull trout were benthic and solitary; most (88 %) were observed at night. We developed a conditional logistic regression model {{to account for the}} effect of fish movement in response to snorkeling, and we fitted 18 candidate models to evaluate the relative influences of biotic and abiotic factors on habitat use. The candidate models were also fitted with a naı̈ve logistic regression (i. e., no movement) to evaluate the effects of movement on inferences of microhabitat use. The most plausible model describing bull trout habitat use was the same for the conditional and naı̈ve regressions and included depth, velocity, percent rubble substratum, and the day 3 depth, body size 3 depth, and body size 3 day 3 depth interactions. The presence of brook trout S. fontinalis and the abundance of conspecifics did not strongly influence microhabitat use by bull trout. The relative rankings of the remaining models differed substantially between the conditional and naı̈ve models. Relative to the conditional models, the naı̈ve models overestimated the importance of diurnal differences in habitat use and overestimated the use of deepwater habitats, particularly during the day. Both model types suggested that all sizes of bull trout were generally found in deeper, low-velocity habitat a...|$|R

They were then transferred to brackish water (BW) for 22 d and fed on diet C. Gill (Na++K+) -ATPase activity and its dependence on ATP, Na + and pH, number of gill chloride cells (CC), serum T 3 level as well as fish growth, condition factor (K) and mortality were evaluated. During the FW phase, as compared to C trout, T trout showed a two fold higher serum T 3 level, had unchanged gill (Na~+K+) -ATPase activity and increased CC number, whereas <b>N</b> <b>trout</b> showed higher gill (Na~+K+) - ATPase activity and CC number. At {{the end of the}} experiment the enzyme activity was in the order T > N > C groups and all groups showed similar CC number.

In BW, T and N groups had higher and lower survival than C group respectively. Other parameters were unaffected by the treatments. This trial suggests that T 3 administration promotes the development of hypoosmoregulatory mechanisms of trout but it leaves the (Na++K+) -ATPase activity unaltered till the transfer to a hyperosmotic environment...|$|R

40|$|Concentrations {{of mercury}} (Hg), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) have been {{investigated}} in whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus, n = 41), European smelt (Osmerus eperlanus, n = 29), Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus, n = 27), perch (Perca fluviatilis, n = 26), brown <b>trout</b> (Salmo trutta, <b>n</b> = 22), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar, n = 14), northern pike (Esox lucius, n = 11), tench (Tinca tinca, n = 4) and crucian carp (Carassius carassius, n = 2), in Lake Norsjø, southern Norway. In addition, the stable isotope ratios  15 N and  13 C have been analysed to reveal variations in trophic position and carbon source, both within and between fish species. The concentrations of Cd and Pb were far below the consumption limits in Norway, i. e. 0, 2 μg Cd/L; 1 μg Pb/L). Only 5, 6 % of the analyzed individuals had Pb-concentrations > the detection limit for Pb (0, 1 mg Pb/kg ww), while none of the individuals exceeded the detection limits for Cd (0, 005 mg Cd/kg ww). The Hg levels varied within and between the fish species. Totally 9 fish had Hg-concentrations above the consumption limit of 0, 5 μg Hg/L, 5 pikes, 2 Arctic char, 1 brown trout and 1 European smelt. The highest concentration, 1, 44 mg Hg/kg ww, was both measured in a brown trout and a northern pike. The δ 15 N and δ 13 C values varied from 7, 2 ‰ to 13, 6 ‰ and - 20, 2 ‰ to - 33, 5 ‰ respectively. The results on δ 15 N indicate a food web consisting of 4 consumer levels. The δ 13 C signatures indicate that Arctic char, European smelt and sub-populations of whitefish primarily feed in the pelagic zone ( 13 C between - 28 and - 34), while the  13 C in perch, brown trout and the other sub-population of whitefish had heavier  13 C signatures, indicating fish feeding in the littoral zone of the lake. All fish species (except Atlantic salmon) exhibit significant correlations (p < 0, 05) between Hg and age, weight and length. Only adult individuals of Atlantic salmon, returned from the sea to River Skienselva for spawning, were incorporated in the study. Low concentrations and minor variations in the Hg-levels (0, 07 – 0, 14 mg Hg/kg ww) in this marine derived individuals, are {{the main reasons for}} no correlation between Hg and age, weight and length for this species. Within each species, no significant correlations were found between Hg and  15 N, but a weak but significant (r 2 = 0, 074, p < 0, 001) positive linear relationship was found when plotting all the fish species together, indicating biomagnification along the food web. The high 15 N signature in the dwarf population of Arctic char is likely a consequence of low condition factor, as transamination and deamination normally occur during starvation. These processes imply isotope fractionation of nitrogen and consequently a heavier  15 N signature...|$|R
40|$|Reconnaissance {{investigations}} {{have been conducted}} to identify how geochemical techniques {{can be applied to}} biological studies to assist wildlife management in and near Yellowstone National Park (the Park). Many elements (for example, As, B, Be, Ce, Cl, Cs, F, Hg, K, Li, Mo, Rb, S, Sb, Si, and W) are commonly enriched in (1) thermal waters in the Yellowstone area, (2) rocks altered by these waters, (3) sinter and travertine deposits, and (4) soils and stream sediments derived from these rocks. Some of these elements, such as As, F, Hg, and Mo, may be toxic to wildlife and could be passed up the food chain to many species of animals. Three investigations are described here. The first discusses the abundance and distribution of selected elements in the scat (feces) of bison (Bison bison), elk (Cervus elaphus), and moose (Alces alces) collected in and near the Park from areas underlain by both unaltered and hydrothermally altered rock. As compared to mean values for stream-sediment analyses, those of scat analyses collected in the Yellowstone area show relatively high concentrations for 12 elements. This suite of elements comprises (1) hydrothermally related elements (As, Br, Cs, Mo, Sb, and W), (2) essential major elements for plants (Ca and K) and some trace elements (Ba, Rb, and Sr) that commonly proxy (substitute) for Ca or K, and (3) zinc. The behavior of zinc is not understood. It is an essential element for plants and animals but does not normally proxy for either Ca or K. Zinc is also not related to hydrothermal activity. This unique behavior of zinc is discussed in other parts of this investigation. Six elements (Cr, Hg, Ni, Pb, Se, and U) that can be toxic to wildlife are present in low concentrations in scat, reflecting their generally low concentrations in rock and stream-sediment samples collected throughout the Park. The chemistry of large-animal scat provides information on the feeding habits of large animals in the Park. Scat chemistry shows a high spatial correlation with fossil or active thermal areas or with areas immediately downstream from thermal areas. The longer that animals forage in these localities, {{the more likely it is}} that they may ingest significant amounts of potentially toxic elements such as arsenic. A second investigation describes the concentration levels of hydrothermal mercury and other elements in cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki bouvieri) and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). These elements are derived from sublacustrine hot springs and their habitats in Yellowstone Lake, and this study demonstrates that mercury can be used as a tracer in animal ecology studies. Mercury concentrations are significant in the muscle (average 0. 9 ppm, dry weight for both) and liver (average cutthroat = 1. 6 ppm, dry weight; average lake trout = 2. 1 ppm) of cutthroat and lake trout populations. The mercury levels in fish are believed to be related to mercury introduced to the lake by sublacustrine hot springs, which have dissolved mercury concentrations of as much as 0. 170 ppb. Methylation of mercury in thermal waters is probably carried out by methanogenic or sulfate-reducing bacteria that live around sublacustrine hot springs and are consumed by crustaceans such as amphipods, which are a major food source for the cutthroat trout. The mercury levels in the cutthroat trout are transferred to lake trout and to land animals that eat trout. For example, hair of grizzly bears that have been collected near Yellowstone Lake have high mercury levels (0. 6 – 1. 7 ppm, dry weight), whereas hair of bears sampled at more remote areas in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem have low mercury contents (0. 006 – 0. 09 ppm, dry weight). This observation provides strong evidence that mercury in grizzly bears is derived from feeding on spawning cutthroat trout in the spring and early summer. Studies of mercury and metal contents in other grizzly bear food sources (plants and animals) show that only cutthroat trout are strongly enriched in mercury. These data can potentially be used to quantify the percentage of the bear population that eats cutthroat trout and to determine how far individual bears travel to Yellowstone Lake to eat them. A third investigation describes carbon-, nitrogen-, and sulfur-isotope compositions in grizzly bears and in some of their foods and describes how these data can be applied to studies of grizzly bear demographics. δ 13 C values in the Yellowstone ecosystem range from – 21. 7 ‰ to – 30. 4 ‰, a range that reflects the influence of C 3 plants on the carbon reservoir and probably the effect of elevation on physiological processes. δ 15 N values range from – 2. 3 ‰ to 11. 0 ‰ and show classical trophic enrichments with respect to most grizzly bear food sources. Cutthroat <b>trout</b> δ 15 <b>N</b> values (8. 3 ± 1. 0 ‰) may reflect the importance of sublacustrine hydrothermal springs to the food chain in Yellowstone Lake. Lake trout have even larger δ 15 N values (11. 0 ± 0. 4 ‰) that are consistent with their feeding on cutthroat trout. Grizzly bear δ 15 N values range from 7. 0 ‰ to 8. 8 ‰. Although grizzly bears are known to eat cutthroat trout, trophic enrichment in δ 15 N above values found in trout is not apparent in analyses of bear hair. This discrepancy occurs because δ 15 N values are averaged over one year and include the significantly lower δ 15 N values of vegetable food sources consumed by bears while their hair is growing. δ 34 S values in the ecosystem range from – 3. 1 ‰ to 11. 1 ‰. δ 34 S values of fish (1. 2 ± 0. 5 ‰) are nearly the same as those in sulfate from thermal springs. Vegetation (clover, cow parsnip, and spring beauty), ungulates (deer, elk, and bison), and moths show a greater range of δ 34 S values (– 3. 3 ‰ to 3. 2 ‰). However, bears show higher δ 34 S values (3. 2 ‰ to 5. 4 ‰ in muscle and 6. 1 ‰ to 8. 7 ‰ in hair) that are consistent with the consumption of whitebark pine nuts (δ 34 S = 8. 3 ‰ to 11. 4 ‰). δ 34 S values in bears and their food sources seem to be constrained by the major sources of sulfate and sulfide sulfur in the igneous and sedimentary rocks that underlie much of the Park. The large δ 34 S values found in bear tissues are consistent with the documented fact that most grizzly bears eat substantial amounts of whitebark pine nuts when available. This consumption occurs during hair growth in the fall, thus providing an isotopic marker that may be useful in quantifying nut consumption in individual bears. These three studies show some different ways that geochemical techniques can be applied to biologic issues. The results suggest that integration of geochemistry into specific biologic studies may help address issues of interest to wildlife managers in Yellowstone National Park and the greater Yellowstone ecosystem...|$|R
