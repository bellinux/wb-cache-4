50|$|India has an {{extensive}} network of inland waterways {{in the form}} of rivers, canals, backwaters and creeks. The total navigable length is 14,500 km, out of which about 5200 km of the river and 4000 km of canals can be used by mechanized crafts. Freight transportation by waterways is highly under-utilized in India compared to other large countries and geographic areas like the United States, China and the European Union. The <b>total</b> cargo moved (<b>in</b> <b>tonne</b> kilometers) by the inland waterway was just 0.1% of the <b>total</b> inland traffic <b>in</b> India, compared to the 21% figure for United States. Cargo transportation in an organised manner is confined to a few waterways in Goa, West Bengal, Assam ,and Kerala.|$|R
50|$|Fishing {{revenue is}} divided into two sub sectors, the {{aquaculture}} sector and the capture sector. The aquaculture sector produced 705,500 and the capture sector produced 374,000 <b>tonnes</b> <b>in</b> 2009. <b>In</b> <b>total,</b> 1,079,500 <b>tonnes</b> of fish were sold. Egypt’s fishing industry production has increased in the last decades. This is mainly due to an increase of the aquaculture sector. The aquaculture sector is the largest sector and accounts for almost 65% of the supply. 99% of production comes from privately owned farms. Tilapia and Mullets are the two most common species in the aquaculture sector.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} of 1 tonne of Portland clinker directly generates approximately 0.55 tonnes of chemical CO2, directly {{as a product}} of these reactions, and requires the combustion of carbonaceous fuel to yield approximately an additional 0.40 tonnes of carbon dioxide, although this is being reduced through gains in process efficiency and the use of waste as fuels. However, <b>in</b> <b>total,</b> 1 <b>tonne</b> of Portland cement leads to the emission of 0.8-1.0 tonnes of carbon dioxide.|$|R
2500|$|The {{lava flow}} stopped after 13months on 21 April, having covered 40km2 {{and with a}} maximum depth of 100m. The lava beds {{produced}} were mainly the ʻAʻā lava type with Pāhoehoe and lava a budella (lava tubes) areas. In April and May 1948 [...] CO2 emitted from cracks in the ground pooled in hollows near to Hekla, killing 15 sheep and some wild animals and birds. <b>In</b> <b>total</b> 24,000 <b>tonnes</b> of CO2 was emitted.
