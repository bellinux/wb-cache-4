2500|$|Associate Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point G. Christopher Williams {{discussed}} {{the relationship between}} GLaDOS and Chell. In response to a quote by designer Erik Wolpaw that read [...] "we wanted you to have this very intimate connection with this AI that changes and evolves over time, {{leading up to the}} point that you betray her and do the most intimate act you can do with someone—murdering them in cold blood", he at first noted that [...] "on the face of it, this description of intimacy seems nonsensical", but also noted that [...] "a changing and evolving relationship with someone in authority over you that eventually leads to betraying them by violating their rules—is one that is an altogether familiar one". He used the parent-child relationship as an example of this and cited a metaphor by psychologist Sigmund Freud which Williams said was about [...] "murdering a parent in an effort to describe how children eventually would attempt <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> under the wing of their parents". He wrote [...] "nothing can be as intimate, perhaps, as loving someone enough to follow their rules and then needing to “kill them” in order to escape that “game,” which makes this game feel like something more like a really familiar relationship". He called her [...] "just one of many countless authorities that have explained to me the rules of a game, how to control myself, and then pushed me towards a particular goal of the computer’s design" [...] and that [...] "this is an experience that I have every time that I fire up my Xbox and describes the curiously intimate relationship between player and gaming system that emerges in single player gameplay". He further discussed that he had no idea that Chell's name was Chell or that she was a female because he recognized the character as himself. He wrote [...] "I cared about GlaDOS only because she was the one directing me. Oh, and then I really cared about her because she wanted to kill me".|$|E
