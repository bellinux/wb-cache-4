40|$|Abstract- We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} taxes on the utilization of inside debt (loans from owners) and outside debt (loans from non– owners) across small businesses organized as <b>taxable</b> <b>corporations</b> and flow–through entities (Subchapter S corporations and partnerships). We find that the tax incentives to use debt differ according {{to the type of}} debt and the type of entity. Our results indicate that the effect of marginal tax rates on the use of outside debt and other non–debt tax shields is similar for both taxable and flow– through entities. In contrast, we find that marginal tax rates are unrelated to the use of inside debt by flow–through entities...|$|R
50|$|Corporate tax {{is imposed}} in the United States at the federal, most state, and some local levels on {{the income of}} {{entities}} treated for tax purposes as corporations. Federal tax rates on corporate taxable income vary from 15% to 35%. State and local taxes and rules vary by jurisdiction, though many are based on federal concepts and definitions. Taxable income may differ from book income both as to timing of income and tax deductions and {{as to what is}} <b>taxable.</b> <b>Corporations</b> are also subject to a federal Alternative Minimum Tax and alternative state taxes. Like individuals, corporations must file tax returns every year. They must make quarterly estimated tax payments. Controlled groups of corporations may file a consolidated return.|$|R

40|$|The {{electoral process}} in the United States {{is going through a}} major {{transition}} as money increasingly pours into non-candidate independent groups (“IGs”). Before 2000, IGs could engage in significant electoral advocacy without having to disclose the IG’s donors or its expenditures. Congress sought to address the lack of disclosure by requiring section 527 political organizations to disclose their contributions and expenditures. IGs quickly sought an alternative organizational form for engaging in political advocacy. The alternative organizational form of choice has been the tax-exempt section 501 (c) (4) social welfare organization. In a 2007 article, I explored whether such tax-exempt entities would be the next loophole used by IGs to avoid disclosure of contributions and expenditures. I concluded then that taxable entities would not be an attractive vehicle because there would be significant tax implications if an entity forwent tax-exempt status, and because <b>taxable</b> <b>corporations</b> were prohibited from expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate. The Supreme Court, however, overturned the ban on independent corporate spending in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. Taxable entities are now a far more attractive vehicle for campaign activity than they were in 2007. Social welfare organizations and other tax-exempt entities are now subject to increased scrutiny. In the campaign finance arena, regulation in one area often entices entities to conduct activities in another. As Congress and the Service consider further regulation of social welfare groups, they must also consider whether further regulation of tax-exempt organizations will encourage IGs to reorganize as taxable organizations. Since taxable entities are subject to less regulation, they will be attractive vehicles as long as the tax consequences to the IGs do not outweigh the economic and regulatory benefits of forgoing tax-exempt status. The key question is a tax question, not an election law question: Can taxable entities engage in campaign activity without incurring significant tax liability...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} issues raised by {{inflation}} and the taxation of business and investment income under an income tax. Some evidence on the tax-induced distortions caused by inflation are presented. This includes estimates of the marginal real tax rates on new investment and the user cost of capital for the various categories of <b>taxable</b> <b>corporations</b> given different assumptions about the rate of inflation and proportion of the investment financed by debt. Comprehensive indexation of business and investment income is considered in the paper as a solution to the problems caused by inflation-induced tax distortions. For business income, this would encompass an indexation of capital consumption allowances, the cost of goods sold, and interest income and expenses. For investment income, it would involve the indexation of capital gains on all financial and real assets and the indexation of interest income and expense. In this context, the new accounting standards of the CICA designed to reflect changing prices are reviewed and the preliminary experience with these standards is assessed. Another related issue that is addressed is the choice of an index. The benefits and cost of comprehensive indexing are considered. The paper concludes its overview of comprehensive indexation with some comments on the experience of other countries, and a review of the U. S. Treasury Department's recent proposals for indexation. A more detailed analysis of the indexation of business income is also included in the paper. Evidence on the impact of indexation, if it were to be adopted, on the real effective tax rate and user cost of new investment is presented for the various categories of <b>taxable</b> <b>corporations</b> given different assumptions about the rate of inflation and the proportion of the investment financed by debt. The reduction in the variance of the real effective tax rate and user cost across categories resulting from indexation is compared with the reduction resulting from the elimination of tax preferences. The difficulties likely to be encountered in any effort to index capital consumption allowances, inventories, and debt are surveyed. Several proposals for partial indexation of business income put forward by John Bossons, the Canadian Manufacturers' Association in Canada and by Auerbach and Jorgenson in the United States are discussed. The paper also contrasts the current capital gains tax with an ideal system based on accrual taxation of real gains and highlights the distortions involved in the current tax treatment of capital gains. The government's proposals for a Registered Shareholder Investment Plan and the Lortie Committee's conclusions and recommendations are reviewed. The ensuing Indexed Security Investment Plan is described and analyzed. Estimates of effective tax rates for securities held within and outside of an ISIP are compared. Statistics indicating the poor public acceptance of ISIPs are cited. Some explanations are offerred. The issues arising from inflation and interest income are also covered in the paper. This includes a discussion of the White Paper's proposal for indexed term loans and deposits and the reasons that it was rejected by the Lortie Committee. The paper ends with my conclusions that, given the recent decline in inflation, indexation of the taxation of business and investment income should not be a tax reform priority. It should only become a priority in two circumstances. The first would be if inflation resurges to double-digit levels and inflation-induced distortions again become a more serious problem. The second would be if the Treasury Department proposals for indexation of business and investment income are implemented in the United States and it becomes advantageous to index to preserve the current degree of tax harmonization between Canada and the United States. If inflation continues to decline, however, {{there is no reason to}} introduce indexation in Canada regardless of whether indexation is adopted in the United States. It would just add another unnecessary element of additional complexity to the tax system. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} net tax {{advantage}} of S corporations relative to C corporations. Our analysis {{indicates that the}} net tax advantage is economically important; it varies directly with the company’s payout ratio, the marginal corporate tax rate, and the capital gains rate of the marginal investor; and it varies inversely with the personal tax rate of the marginal investor. The analysis predicts that the fair market value of a S corporation will exceed that of an otherwise identical C corporation. This prediction holds even {{in the case of}} an acquisition of a S corporation. Consistent with our predictions, we find that publicly traded master limited partnerships, which enjoy net tax advantages in the early 1980 s, are valued at a premium relative to <b>taxable</b> <b>corporations</b> operating in the same industry. [JEL CODES:?] n S corporation status was created by Congress in 1958 as part of a program to offer tax incentives for small business growth. Prior to 1996, S corporations were limited to a maximum of 35 shareholders, could have only one class of common stock, and could have no foreign or corporate shareholders. Beginning in 1996, the maximum number of shareholders was increased to 75, and the set of eligible shareholders was expanded to include some trusts, some tax-exempt organizations, and some banks. 1 S corporations are pass-through entities in which the corporation’s entire taxable income is passed through to shareholders before being taxed at the personal level. In effect, the corporation is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Shareholders pay tax on the corporation’s entire income regardless of whether that income is distributed to shareholders in the form of a dividend or share repurchase. By contrast, C corporations (commonly referred to as regular corporations) first pay tax at the corporate level on the corporation’s entire income. Subsequently, shareholders are taxed at the personal level on any cash distribution or realization of capital gains. ...|$|R

30|$|Our {{study may}} be subject to several {{potential}} caveats. Firstly, access to tax related data is a complex issue in most developed countries. In Spain, the <b>taxable</b> income of <b>corporations</b> and therefore deferred tax assets and liabilities has been explicitly included in financial statements from fiscal year 2007 onwards which makes the time horizon of our study relatively short. As more historical tax data become available, we expect improved results and availability of more accurate values for marginal tax rates. Moreover, the effect of taxes on companies’ debt policy might be conditioned by time issues as previous research indicate that financing choices are mostly long-term decisions and companies adapt their structure only very slowly (Fama and French 2012).|$|R
