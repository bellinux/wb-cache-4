5|$|Highway72 {{was built}} as a <b>trunk</b> <b>route</b> by 1920, and became a provincial highway in 1937. It has {{remained}} largely unchanged since then, aside from the reconstruction and realignment of the Frog Rapids bridge, and the renumbering of the fork towards Hudson as Highway664. The length of the highway is , the entirety of which is situated in Kenora District. There are no significant settlements between its endpoints.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1910s, a {{passable}} {{dirt and}} gravel road connected Ukiah and Nevada City via the south side of Clear Lake and Marysville. The portion between Lower Lake and Wilbur Springs was impassable in wet weather, at which times the Bartlett Springs and Bear Valley Toll-road via Upper Lake and Bartlett Springs was available for $1.50 each way or $2.50 round trip. This route generally followed the present SR 20, except around Clear Lake and between Marysville and Rough and Ready (where it used Spenceville Road). Beyond Nevada City to Emigrant Gap, the old turnpike was not passable; instead the present SR 174 was available for eastward drivers. Between Williams and Colusa, the road was paved in concrete, as it had been added to the state highway system as part of the first (1910) bond issue, specifically as Route 15, connecting the west Sacramento Valley <b>trunk</b> (<b>Route</b> 7, now I-5) with the county seat of Colusa.|$|E
50|$|Rea Vaya routes {{are divided}} into three classifications: <b>trunk</b> <b>routes</b> on the main {{highways}} and between major destinations; complementary routes running on circular routes that connect to trunks; and feeder routes that radiate out from <b>trunk</b> <b>routes</b> to outlying suburbs.|$|R
50|$|In March 2006, Rapid Bus revamped the {{bus network}} serving Kepong, Selayang, Gombak, Batu Caves, Bandar Sri Damansara and Bandar Manjalara areas which it called Area 2. The areas are now service by four <b>Trunk</b> <b>Routes</b> and 35 Local Shuttle routes when fully implemented. The four <b>trunk</b> <b>routes</b> all begin from the Titiwangsa hub where {{passengers}} can change to City Shuttles. At the other end, the <b>trunk</b> <b>routes</b> serve regional hubs where Local Shuttles fan {{out into the}} residential suburbs.|$|R
50|$|The network {{originally}} operated along bus <b>trunk</b> <b>routes</b> {{through the}} inner suburbs, but {{passed through the}} CBD rather than terminating there. This reduced overcrowding on the <b>trunk</b> <b>routes</b> without needing to layover extra buses in the CBD. This concept was later diluted with the network's expansion to include long distance routes servicing major activity centres in outer suburbs.|$|R
5|$|In 1825 the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) {{established}} Fort Vancouver on {{the bank}} of the Columbia, in what is now Vancouver, Washington, as the headquarters of the company's Columbia District, which encompassed everything west of the Rocky Mountains. John McLoughlin, a physician, was appointed Chief Factor of the Columbia District. The HBC reoriented its Columbia District operations toward the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia, which became the region's main <b>trunk</b> <b>route.</b> In the early 1840s Americans began to colonize the Oregon country in large numbers via the Oregon Trail, despite the HBC's efforts to discourage American settlement in the region. For many the final leg of the journey involved travel down the lower Columbia River to Fort Vancouver. This part of the Oregon Trail, from The Dalles to Fort Vancouver, was the trail's most treacherous stretch, which prompted the 1846 construction of the Barlow Road.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s TAT began taking {{advantage}} of the EU's newly liberalised internal air transport market by launching a three times daily scheduled service between Paris-Charles de Gaulle and London Gatwick, the first time it had operated a scheduled service on a major international European <b>trunk</b> <b>route.</b> This was also the time TAT began marketing itself as TAT European Airlines.|$|E

25|$|The {{northern}} {{section of}} the Oxford Canal between Coventry, Braunston and Napton remained an important <b>trunk</b> <b>route,</b> and remained extremely busy with freight traffic until the 1960s.

However, the southern section from Napton to Oxford became something of a backwater, and carried mostly local traffic.|$|E
25|$|Freight {{operations}} {{are carried out}} by KiwiRail, and provides {{the overwhelming majority of}} revenue traffic.

25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, the {{disadvantages}} of the East Coast Main <b>Trunk</b> <b>route</b> through the Karangahake and Athenree gorges became starkly apparent. The capacity of the line was constrained by several factors; its length, severe grades of up to 1:50, sharp curves of up to 6 chains radius, and light 55lb per yard rail which prohibited the use of the more powerful diesel locomotives. It was also an unreliable route, with frequent disruptions caused by slips.|$|E
25|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{arrival at}} Glasgow of BEA's first Comet 4B revenue {{service and a}} British Eagle BAC One-Eleven proving flight from Heathrow on 2 May 1966 coincided {{with the opening of}} the city's new Abbotsinch Airport. This event was followed by British Eagle's first Heathrow—Glasgow One-Eleven revenue service on 9 May, making it the second British independent airline after BUA to operate scheduled jet services on domestic trunk routes. Although BUA's services preceded BEA's and British Eagle's by four months, this occasion marked the first time jets were used to operate scheduled services on a domestic <b>trunk</b> <b>route</b> from Heathrow. It also marked the first time parallel jet competition was introduced on a UK domestic <b>trunk</b> <b>route,</b> as well as the fourth time such competition was introduced anywhere. British Eagle initially operated its scheduled domestic jet services with a pair of 200 series One-Elevens leased from the Central African Airways, pending delivery of the UK carrier's first three One-Eleven 300s between the end of May and July. British Eagle marketed its 79-seat, all-tourist Heathrow—Glasgow One-Eleven jet services as a better and faster alternative to BEA's Comet 4B services and as a less time-consuming option compared with BUA's Gatwick—Glasgow InterJet One-Eleven service.|$|E
25|$|In 1906 the new <b>trunk</b> <b>route</b> to Fishguard opened, with GWR {{hopes of}} making the harbour there an ocean terminal.
