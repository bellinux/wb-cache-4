500|$|... "Otis" [...] is {{two minutes}} and fifty-eight seconds long and is a mid-tempo hip-hop song. The song, which was {{produced}} by West, is built upon a sample of <b>Try</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Tenderness by Otis Redding. Jay-Z and West promptly rap over the sample in style reminiscent to past Kanye productions. Pitchfork's Tom Breihan summarized the composition, writing ...|$|E

5000|$|Since its release, {{the album}} has {{received}} mixed reviews. Robert Copsey from Digital Spy gave the album 3 stars (out of 5), saying that [...] "Euphoria fits between the sentimental Iglesias of the 'Hero' and 'Bailamos' era and the new, Down With The Kids Enrique. The latter is generally more entertaining, with the robotic vocal effects and rave-tinged production, {{but the end}} result here is not necessarily what Iglesias may have intended". He finished the review saying that [...] "Euphoria is a mixed bag of <b>a</b> record which <b>tries</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too hard to please the disparate elements of his fanbase". In a more negative review, [...] "Doug Belfast" [...] from Sputnik Music thought that [...] "Euphoria is really a mixed bag of <b>a</b> record that <b>tries</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too hard at being something different, <b>tries</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too hard at recapturing {{the glory of the}} past and <b>tries</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too hard capturing a new fan base. All this is too hard to garner in one single record".|$|R

Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Død Kalm" [...] a B, noting that, [...] "Despite clumsy makeup, isolation {{pays off}} again, and Mulder and Scully get to <b>try</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tenderness." [...] Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club, despite noting his original dislike for the episode, awarded it a B rating and wrote, [...] "This episode works, almost {{in spite of}} itself. There are so many nice little moments here [...] it's a script that pauses from the constant horror the show had been serving up for several episodes in a row to just tell an unsettling, ultimately moving tale of two friends who look into the abyss and somehow don't fall." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "C" [...] grade rating. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one-and-a-half stars out of five. The two criticized Spotnitz [...] "attention seeking direction", citing the [...] "strange cross fades" [...] and [...] "exaggerated camera angles" [...] as detractors. Furthermore, they were critical about the story, writing that it was [...] "all over the place". Ultimately, Shearman and Pearson concluded that the entry {{was an example of}} [...] "this new season [...] to <b>try</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> harder" [...] in order to become a success.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{think you}} will find,' resumed Knight, {{pursuing}} the conversation more {{for the sake of}} finishing off his thoughts on the subject than for engaging her attention, 'that in actual life it is merely a matter of instinct with men--this trying to push on. They awake to a recognition that they have, without premeditation, begun to <b>try</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> and they say to themselves, [...] "Since I have tried thus much, I will <b>try</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more."
