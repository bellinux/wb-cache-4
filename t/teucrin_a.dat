40|$|Aim: Two {{recurrent}} {{cases of}} severe acute liver injury {{attributed to the}} use of a wild germander decoction, prepared with some variation in traditional method has been reported. The aim {{of the present study was}} to correlate the hepatotoxic effect observed in patients who consumed germander decoction with <b>teucrin</b> <b>A</b> levels. Antioxidant properties were analyzed to assess any possible differences between the decoction used traditionally by the family (without negative consequences) and the decoction taken by the patients. Materials and Methods: Different types of germander decoctions were prepared in the laboratory by simulating the same conditions for preparing the decoction by the patients and their family members. The levels of <b>teucrin</b> <b>A,</b> the polyphenols and the antioxidant power were determined. One‑way analysis of variance was used to test for differences between the groups. Results and Conclusions: The extract consumed by the patients had higher concentration of <b>teucrin</b> <b>A,</b> lower antioxidant activity and lower content of polyphenols compared with the traditional decoction, revealing an inverse relationship between <b>teucrin</b> <b>A</b> content and antioxidant capacity. These case reports emphasize that more information is needed on the safety and quality of these natural products...|$|E
40|$|Labdane and clerodane bicyclic diterpenes are an {{important}} group of plants secondary metabolites. Compounds of this group with a furan nucleus have a toxic potential. Studies on Wall germander (Teucrium chamaedrys L.) have shown that hepatotoxicity of this plant is related to a furano-clerodane diterpene: <b>teucrin</b> <b>A.</b> The mechanism of toxicity involves the furan nucleus and is induced by the metabolism {{of this type of}} compounds by the P 450 3 A cytochromes. This type of potential toxic molecules are part of many Lamiaceae, the experimental study performed presents their extraction, detection and identification into Teucrium scorodonia L. and Ballota nigra var. foetida Hayek. mother tinctures.

40|$|Mass spectrometric {{fragmentation}} data of neo-clerodane diterpenes {{are almost}} inexistent {{but they can}} prove helpful for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of these compounds {{as well as for}} the identification of unknown compounds belonging to this class of plant secondary metabolites. [M-H]-ions of nine neo-clerodane diterpenes (1 - 9), recently isolated from Teucrium chamaedrys, were generated by electrospray ionization and were fragmented in the collision cell of a Triple Quadrupole (TQ) and of a Quadrupole Ion Trap (QIT) mass spectrometer. The deprotonated neo-clerodane glucosides, chamaedryoside A and B (1, 2), readily lost the sugar residue to give, as their main fragmentation channel, the neo-clerodane ions, I and II, which were structurally characterized by TQ and QIT MS. The collision-activated dissociation (CAD) mass spectra of I and II and of deprotonated neo-clerodanes 3 - 9 allowed us to reach some general conclusions on the fragmentation pathways of this class of compounds. For example, teuflin and its OH derivatives, <b>teucrin</b> <b>A,</b> teuflidin and 6 -β-hydroxyteucridin, showed a characteristic fragmentation pattern involving the loss of 94 Da and 124 Da from the lactone moiety, whereas a loss of 44 Da was observed for teucrin E, and of 58 Da for teucrin F and G. In addition, several compound-specific fragmentations were observed and can be proposed for the identification of individual compounds. The systematic approach allowed us to hypothesize the mechanisms of the most important collision-activated dissociation/isomerization channels. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} well {{established}} that the formation of reactive metabolites of drugs is associated with drug toxicity. Similarly, there are accumulating data suggesting {{the role of the}} formation of reactive metabolites/intermediates hydrolase. On the other hand, some herbal/dietary constituents were shown to form reactive intermediates capable Life Sciences 74 (2004) 935 – 968 of irreversibly inhibiting various CYPs. The resultant metabolites lead to CYP inactivation by chemical modification of the heme, the apoprotein, or both as a result of covalent binding of modified heme to the apoprotein. Some examples include bergamottin, a furanocoumarin of grapefruit juice; capsaicin from chili peppers; glabridin, an isoflavan from licorice root; isothiocyanates found in all cruciferous vegetables; oleuropeinthrough bioactivation in herbal toxicity and carcinogenicity. It has been hypothesized that the resultant reactive metabolites following herbal bioactivation covalently bind to cellular proteins and DNA, leading to toxicity via multiple mechanisms such as direct cytotoxicity, oncogene activation, and hypersensitivity reactions. This is exemplified by aristolochic acids present in Aristolochia spp, undergoing reduction of the nitro group by hepatic cytochrome P 450 (CYP 1 A 1 / 2) or peroxidases in extrahepatic tissues to reactive cyclic nitrenium ion. The latter was capable of reacting with DNA and proteins, resulting in activation of H-ras oncogene, gene mutation and finally carcinogenesis. Other examples are pulegone present in essential oils from many mint species; and <b>teucrin</b> <b>A,</b> a diterpenoid found in germander (Teuchrium chamaedrys) used as an adjuvant to slimming diets. Extensive pulegone metabolism generated p-cresol that was a glutathione depletory, and the furan ring of the diterpenoids i...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a {{globally}} increasing application of herbal medicines and dietary supplements to treat various chronic diseases and to promote health. However, there are increasing clinical reports on the organ toxicities associated with consumption of herbal medicines. This review updates the knowledge on metabolic activation of herbal components and its clinical and toxicological implications. Like many synthetic drugs undergoing metabolic activation to form reactive metabolites which are often associated with drug toxicity, it is recognized that some herbal components may also be converted to toxic, or even mutagenetic and carcinogenic metabolites by cytochrome P 450 s (CYPs) and less frequently by Phase II conjugating enzymes. This is exemplified by aristolochic acids (AAs) in Aristolochia spp, which undergo reduction of the nitro group by hepatic CYP 1 A 1 / 2 or peroxidases in extrahepatic tissues to generate highly reactive cyclic nitrenium ions. The latter can react with macromolecules (DNA and protein), resulting in activation of Hras oncogene and gene mutation in renal cells and finally carcinogenesis of the kidneys. Some naturally occurring flavonoids (e. g. quercetin) and alkenylbenzenes (e. g. safrole, methyleugenol and estragole) can undergo metabolic activation by sequential 1 -hydroxylation and sulfation, resulting in reactive intermediates capable of forming DNA adducts and finally genotoxicity. Additional examples are pulegone present in essential oils from many mint species; and <b>teucrin</b> <b>A,</b> a diterpenoid found in germander (Teuchrium chamaedrys) used as an adjuvant to slimming dietary supplements but caused severe hepatotoxicity. Extensive pulegone metabolism generated pcresol that was a glutathione depletory, whereas the furan ring of the diterpenoids in germander was oxidized by CYP 3 A 4 to reactive epoxide which can inactivate hepatic CYP 3 A and epoxide hydrolase through covalent binding. The hepatotoxic and carcinogenic species of plant pyrrolizidine alkaloids (e. g. echimidine and jacobine), namely pyrrole-type metabolites, are generated by hepatic CYP 2 B 6 and CYP 3 A 4. Potential mechanisms underlying the hepatotoxicity of kava have been related to intracellular glutathione depletion and/or quinone formation. Some herbal constituents (e. g. capsaicin from chili peppers, glabridin from licorice root, oleuropein in olive oil, dially sulfone in garlic, and resveratrol found in red wine) behave as mechanism-based inhibitors of various CYPs. This may provide an explanation for some reported herb-drug interactions. In addition, the inhibition of CYPs by herbal constituents may decrease the formation of toxic metabolites and thus inhibit carcinogenesis, as CYPs {{play an important role in}} procarcinogen activation. Due to the wide use and easy availability of herbal medicines, further research should be conducted to ensure the safety and quality of herbal medicine...|$|E
