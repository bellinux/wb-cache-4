5|$|Moral {{rights in}} United Kingdom law {{are parts of}} {{copyright}} law that protect the personal interests of {{the author of a}} copyrighted work, as well as the economic interests protected by other elements of copyright. Found in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, the moral rights are <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to be identified as the author of a work, known as <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of paternity, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to object to derogatory treatment of a work, known as <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of integrity, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> not to be identified as the author of someone else's work, and <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to privacy. <b>The</b> <b>right</b> of paternity exists for the entire copyright term, and requires individuals who commercially broadcast, sell, perform or exhibit literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works to identify the author of the work – but this does not apply to things such as typefaces, encyclopaedias or works subject to crown copyright.|$|E
5|$|Several {{of these}} rights {{regulate}} pre-trial procedure: {{access to a}} non-excessive bail, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to indictment by a grand jury, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to an information (charging document), <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to a speedy trial, and <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to be tried in a specific venue. Several of these rights are trial rights: <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses at trial, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to confront witnesses at trial, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to a public trial, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to a trial by an impartial petit jury selected from a specific geography, and <b>the</b> <b>right</b> not to be compelled to testify against oneself. Others, such as the assistance of counsel and due process rights, have application throughout the proceeding.|$|E
5|$|The Assistance of Counsel Clause includes, as {{relevant}} here, {{at least six}} distinct rights: <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to counsel of choice, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to appointed counsel, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> not to be constructively denied counsel, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to conflict-free counsel, the effective assistance of counsel, and <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to represent oneself pro se.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rights</b> of Woman is an {{extension}} of Wollstonecraft's arguments in <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of Men. In <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of Men, as the title suggests, she is concerned with <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of particular men (18th-century British men) while in <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of Woman, she is concerned with <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> afforded to [...] "woman", an abstract category. She does not isolate her argument to 18th-century women or British women. The first chapter of <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of Woman addresses the issue of natural rights and asks who has those inalienable rights and on what grounds. She answers that since natural rights are given by God, for one segment of society to deny them to another segment is a sin. <b>The</b> <b>Rights</b> of Woman thus engages not only specific events in France and in Britain but also larger questions being raised by political philosophers such as John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|R

5|$|Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, {{specifically}} Article 9(1), guarantees <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to {{life and}} <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to personal liberty. The Court of Appeal has called <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to life {{the most basic of}} human rights, but has yet to fully define the term in the Constitution. Contrary to the broad position taken in jurisdictions such as Malaysia and the United States, the High Court of Singapore has said that personal liberty only refers to freedom from unlawful incarceration or detention.|$|E
5|$|At Caspers Wilderness Park, the San Juan Canyon {{opens up}} into a fairly wide valley {{in the foothills of}} the Santa Ana Mountains. This reach of San Juan Creek is {{underlain}} by thick alluvial deposits and is still used for farming and grazing. It is joined by Bell Canyon from <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> from several residential communities that overlook, but do not border, it. and Verdugo Canyon Creek from the left. Trampas Canyon enters from the left and Cañada Gobernadora and Cañada Chiquita enter from <b>the</b> <b>right.</b> The creek flows through residential Rancho Mission Viejo, crosses under Interstate 5, and enters a concrete flood control channel, turning south and receiving El Horno Creek on <b>the</b> <b>right.</b> It receives its largest tributary, Trabuco Creek, from <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> then flows south toward the Pacific Ocean. The creek forms a fresh water lagoon at the northern end of Doheny State Beach, which overflows into Capistrano Bay during periods of high flow.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> human <b>rights</b> of {{children}} have been established step by step since {{the early part of}} the 20 th century. In 1989, the UN adopted the Convention on <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of <b>the</b> Child, in which children were accorded not only <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of <b>the</b> child but also those <b>rights</b> established in <b>the</b> UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In Japan, however, both the government and public opinion maintain a conservative attitude toward the Convention on <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of <b>the</b> Child. Hence, the Committee on <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of <b>the</b> Child and local Japanese governmental bodies, which obey Convention on <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of <b>the</b> Child, carry out important roles for insuring of <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> {{of children}}. Recently, the effects of globalization have been increasing in many areas. International competition has intensified and the ideas of economic and social value promoted by international capital are on the rise in many countries. In Japan, educational policy and methods of childcare have been altered as a result of these broader changes. For these reasons, the Committee on <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of <b>the</b> Child has developed new recommendations for reconstructing the current system in order to protect <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of children which may be threatened by the global social changes produced by this highly competitive environment. Moreover, local Japanese governmental bodies, which obey the Convention on <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of <b>the</b> Child, now have a new set of problems arising from the need to consider <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of children in regions outside their jurisdiction...|$|R

5|$|By the mid 20th century, in some European countries, {{women still}} lacked some {{significant}} rights. Feminists {{in these countries}} continued to fight for voting rights. In Switzerland, women gained <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to vote in federal elections in 1971; but in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden women obtained <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced {{to do so by}} the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland. In Liechtenstein, women were given <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to vote by the women's suffrage referendum of 1984. Three prior referendums held in 1968, 1971 and 1973 had failed to secure women's right to vote.|$|E

Its front {{possibly}} had two quadrangular pillars, traces of one are seen around the ceiling. A rock beam was present over the pillars, above the beam ribs and a rail pattern could have existed. In a recess below the veranda is an earth-filled cistern. A door with a small window to the left leads into the middle room. The middle room has a bench along <b>the</b> <b>right</b> wall. Towards {{the back of the}} middle room, to the left, is the half cell and to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> the cell.

5|$|During the 2009 {{parliamentary}} debate on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to vote's status, Thio Li-ann proposed that, to avoid doubt, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> should be specifically {{set out in}} the Constitution. She argued that entrenching <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to vote through an Article in the Constitution would provide the opportunity to protect the details of <b>the</b> <b>right.</b> Currently, voting is regulated by the PEA. As it is an ordinary statute, it can be altered with a simple parliamentary majority by future governments seeking to amend or restrict voting rights. Thio said that expressing <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to vote clearly in the Constitution would allow aspects of that right such as voter secrecy and the universality and equality of votes to be protected from unjust manipulation.|$|E
