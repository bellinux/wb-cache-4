5|$|As long as {{maple syrup}} {{does not have}} an {{off-flavour}} and is of a uniform colour and clean and free from turbidity and sediment, it can be labelled as one of the A grades. If it exhibits any of these problems, it does not meet Grade A requirements and must be labelled as Processing Grade maple syrup and may not be sold in containers smaller than 5 gallons. If maple syrup does not meet the requirements of Processing Grade maple syrup (including a fairly characteristic maple <b>taste),</b> <b>it</b> is classified as Substandard.|$|E

5|$|Various authors regard Suillus collinitus as edible with a sour odor and nondescript <b>taste.</b> <b>It</b> is advisable, as for {{all species}} of Suillus, to pick only young {{specimens}} and to peel the cuticle before preparation. The mushroom contains several tocopherols, {{a class of}} chemical compounds collectively known as vitamin E, and which confer antioxidant activity. They also contain several organic acids, most predominantly the pairs malic and quinic acids, and citric and ketoglutaric acid, which respectively make up 42% and 30% of total organic acids. The composition and concentration of organic acids in mushrooms are major factors in influencing their flavour; some organic acids contribute to antioxidant activity.|$|E

This leaves Jack with the problem of disposing with the wine. He decides to market it to hip-hop producer Ridikolous (LL Cool J), {{and at the same time}} patch up things between Tracy and Ridikolous, who was not allowed into one of Tracy's parties. Jack and Ridikolous have a meeting, resulting in the wine becoming the corporate sponsor of the Source Awards, which is being produced by Ridikolous. To further mend things with Tracy, Jack proposes to let Tracy host the award show. This backfires when Tracy refuses to host it in fear that he will get shot, but Jack still sees it as the only way to work things out with Ridikolous.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} among historians that Bhimsen was not behind the poisoning. Bhimsen had nothing to gain by killing an infant less a year old, and the accusation was simply a ruse to answer foreign inquiries on Bhimsen's imprisonment. It was a general practice among the physicians of the time to check {{the strength of their}} medicine by first letting the mother <b>taste</b> <b>it,</b> before giving it to their new born. It was later rumored that it was the Junior Queen who had actually contrived to kill the Senior Queen by poisoning the medicine intended for her new born. While the poison did not express itself on the intended Queen, it managed to kill the infant prince, and the powerless Bhimsen was made a convenient scapegoat. Historian Gyanmani Nepal contends this to be closer to the truth.|$|E

25|$|Wood-tar {{creosote}} is a colourless to yellowish greasy liquid with a smoky odor, {{produces a}} sooty flame when burned, {{and has a}} burned <b>taste.</b> <b>It</b> is non-buoyant in water, with a specific gravity of 1.037 to 1.087, retains fluidity at a very low temperature, and boils at 205-225°C. When transparent, it is in its purest form. Dissolution in water requires up to 200 {{times the amount of}} water as the base creosote. The creosote is a combination of natural phenols: primarily guaiacol and creosol (4-methylguaiacol), which will typically constitute 50% of the oil; second in prevalence, cresol and xylenol; the rest being a combination of monophenols and polyphenols.|$|E
25|$|The show {{saw many}} changes through the decades, in style, design, fashion and <b>taste.</b> <b>It</b> {{periodically}} had {{some aspect of}} its title sequence, logo and theme tune, format, or set design altered in some way, keeping the show looking modern despite its age. The programme had several executive producers during its run (although not all were billed as such), {{in charge of the}} overall production of the show, although specific content on individual shows was sometimes decided by other producers. When Stewart left the show in 1973, after nearly 10 years in charge, he was replaced by Robin Nash. Both Stewart and Nash made brief returns to the show as producer after they left, in 1976 and 1981 respectively.|$|E

25|$|In Northern Iran, Mâst Chekide is {{a variety}} of kefir yogurt with a {{distinct}} sour <b>taste.</b> <b>It</b> is usually mixed with a pesto-like water and fresh herb purée called delal. Yogurt is a side dish to all Iranian meals. The most popular appetizers are spinach or eggplant borani, Mâst-o-Khiâr with cucumber, spring onions and herbs, and Mâst-Musir with wild shallots. In the summertime, yogurt and ice cubes are mixed together with cucumbers, raisins, salt, pepper and onions and topped with some croutons made of Persian traditional bread {{and served as a}} cold soup. Ashe-Mâst is a warm yogurt soup with fresh herbs, spinach and lentils. Even the leftover water extracted when straining yogurt is cooked to make a sour cream sauce called kashk, which is usually used as a topping on soups and stews.|$|E
25|$|N. lamarckia {{is grown}} as an ornamental, and for low-grade timber and paper.

Kadamba yields a pulp of satisfactory brightness and performance as a hand sheet. The wood can be easily impregnated with synthetic resins to increase its density and compressive strength. The wood has a density of 290–560kg/cu m at 15% moisture content, a fine to medium texture; straight grain; low luster and has no characteristic odor or <b>taste.</b> <b>It</b> is easy to work, with hand and machine tools, cuts cleanly, gives a very good surface and is easy to nail.

25|$|Many of {{the water}} meadows are rich in pignut (Conopodium majus), a {{relative}} of parsley, which formed a breaktime snack for children in former times. The plant is dug up to harvest a small potato-like structure that, eaten raw, has a slightly nutty <b>taste.</b> <b>It</b> is available commercially for salads, etc. Hemlock water dropwort grows well in the wetter areas and is best left alone as the name hemlock suggests. The large leaves of the butterbur (Petasites hybridus) are found in several areas; its name harkens {{back to the days}} before clingfilm or cheap paper when the leaves were used to wrap butter destined for the market. Water ragwort (or Saracen's ragwort) (a species of Senecio) is an introduced plant that grows along the Garnock in tall stands. Although it is common on the Garnock and at present quite rare elsewhere. Himalayan balsam or policemen's helmets is another introduction, but a common one. Giant hogweed is beginning to make its presence felt. It is another plant that should never be handled, as the sap can cause severe blistering and scarring of the skin.|$|E

25|$|In Sri Lanka, {{several types}} of congee are known as kenda in Sinhalese. Sinhala people use congee as a breakfast, a side dish, an {{accessory}} to indigenous medical therapies, and a sweet. Kenda can be prepared with many ingredients, including rice, roasted rice, rice flour, finger millet flour, sago, coconut milk, herbs, tubers, kitul flour, and mung bean. When it is prepared with rice and water only, it is known as hal kenda. If salt is added to bring a much saltier <b>taste,</b> <b>it</b> is known as lunu kenda, a dish commonly used as a supplementary diet in purgation therapy in indigenous medical traditions. If roasted rice is used, the congee becomes bendi hal kenda, utilized to treat diarrheal diseases. If rice flour and coconut milk are the main ingredients, such congee is known as kiriya. If finger millet flour and water is used, it is known as kurakkan anama. If coconut milk is added, the dish is called kurakkan kenda. If sago is used, such congee is known as sawu kenda. A special type of congee prepared from the byproducts of coconut oil production is known as pol kiri kenda. There are many varieties of kola kenda, congee with herbs as an ingredient; sometimes, a vaidya or veda mahttaya (a physician trained in indigenous medical traditions) might prescribe a special type of kola kenda, known under such circumstances as behet kenda. Sinhala villagers use specific tubers for preparing congee, such as Diascorea species tubers. If kitul flour is mixed with boiling water and coconut milk added to it, this special type of congee is known as kitul piti kenda. Kenda prepared with mung beans is known as mung eta kenda.|$|E
