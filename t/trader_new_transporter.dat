40|$|We {{revisit the}} effect of traders' {{experience}} on price bubbles by introducing either one-third or two-thirds steady inflow of <b>new</b> <b>traders</b> in the repeated experimental asset markets.

40|$|We demonstrate, for {{the first}} time, a {{functional}} polyamine biosynthetic pathway in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum that culminates in the synthesis of spermine. Additionally, we also report putrescine and spermidine salvage in the malaria parasite. Putrescine and spermidine transport in P. falciparum infected red blood cells is a highly specific, carrier mediated and active process, mediated by <b>new</b> <b>transporters</b> that differ from the transporters of uninfected red blood cells in their kinetic parameters, $V_{max}$ and $k_m$, {{as well as in}} their activation energy...|$|R

Using the grappler, Enterprise successfully grabs an attacking Suliban ship, the pilot ejecting. After studying the captured ship and its controls, Archer and Tucker pilot it to the Helix.

40|$|Aims: Transporter {{proteins}} {{known to}} mediate multidrug resistance (MDR) in tumour cells—MDR 1 P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance related protein 1 (MRP 1) —are {{thought to be}} involved in protecting the lungs against inhaled toxic pollutants. Recently, several <b>new</b> <b>transporter</b> family members have been identified—for example, MRP 2, MRP 3, and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). To study the possible contribution of these proteins and the earlier defined MDR 1 and MDR 3 P-gp molecules, MRP 1, and the major vault protein (MVP) to lung functioning, their expression was analysed in normal lung tissue of humans and several animal species...|$|R
50|$|At this time, the {{intention}} {{was that the}} even heavier Conqueror tank would be transported by a whole <b>new</b> <b>transporter</b> of equally large capacity, the Leyland FV 1000. This was 2 ft wider than the Antar, as the Antar had in turn been 2 ft wider than the Diamond T. They were to be equipped with a semi-trailer of 60 tons capacity, given the design number FV 3301. This design was ungainly and top-heavy when loaded, being high at the rear to clear the wheels and sloping downwards towards the front to better place {{the weight of the}} load.|$|R

40|$|In parasites, ATP-binding {{cassette}} (ABC) transporters {{represent an}} important family of proteins related to drug resistance and other biological activities. Here we report {{the characterization of}} LtrABCA 2, a <b>new</b> ABC <b>transporter</b> of the ABCA subfamily in the protozoan parasite Leishmania tropica, localized at the flagellar pocket region and in internal vesicles. The overexpression of this transporter reduced the accumulation of fluorescent glycerophospholipid analogs, increased the exocytic activity, and decreased infectivity of macrophage, but did not confer resistance to drugs. Together, {{these results suggest that}} this <b>new</b> ABC <b>transporter</b> plays a role in phospholipid trafficking, which may be modifying the vesicular trafficking and the infectivity of the parasite. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.
