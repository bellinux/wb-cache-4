25|$|In figure 2, the process-data {{diagram of}} the {{delivery}} phase within CCU is depicted. This way of modeling was invented by Saeki (2003). On the left side {{you can see the}} meta-process model and on the right side the meta-data model. The two models are linked to each other by the relationships visualized as dotted lines. The meta-data model (right side) shows the concepts involved in the process and how the concepts are related to each other. For instance it is visible that a package consists of multiple parts, being the: software package, system description, manual, and license and management information. The numbers between the relations indicate in what quantity the concepts are related. For example the “1..1” between package and software package means that a package has to contain at least 1 software package and at the most 1 software package. So in this case a package just has to contain 1 software package. On {{the left side of the}} picture the process-data model is depicted. This consists of all the activities within the delivery process. <b>This</b> <b>article</b> <b>is</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> this process-data model. The meta-process model (left side of the process-data diagram) is divided into several parts which are presented along with the corresponding paragraphs throughout the article to make it easier to understand.|$|E
500|$|The {{definition}} of the area covered by a list of [...] "North American" [...] birds is somewhat subjective. The original list published by the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) in 1886 covered birds found in North America north of Mexico, and included Baja California, Bermuda and Greenland. In 1983, the area was expanded to include all of Mexico, Central America south through Panama, the West Indies and the Hawaiian Islands, while Greenland was dropped. This expansion more than doubled the number of birds on the AOU list. Other organizations, such as the American Birding Association (ABA), use a smaller area: the current ABA area includes the 49 continental states of the US, Canada and the French islands of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, plus surrounding waters. It does not include Greenland, Bermuda, the Bahamas or the Hawaiian Islands. <b>This</b> <b>article</b> <b>is</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> a checklist used by the ABA, which used by most field guides for North American birds, and is complete up to October 2015. Since the ABA follows the AOU on taxonomical matters, the AOU's list is used to settle questions of taxonomy.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first modern}} report of sickle-cell disease {{may have been}} in 1846, where the autopsy of an {{executed}} runaway slave was discussed; the key findings was the absence of the spleen. There were also reports amongst African slaves in the United States exhibiting resistance to malaria but being prone to leg ulcers. The abnormal characteristics of the red blood cells, which later lent their name to the condition, was first described by Ernest E. Irons (1877–1959), intern to the Chicago cardiologist and professor of medicine James B. Herrick (1861–1954), in 1910. Irons saw [...] "peculiar elongated and sickle-shaped" [...] cells in the blood of a man named Walter Clement Noel, a 20-year-old first-year dental student from Grenada. Noel had been admitted to the Chicago Presbyterian Hospital in December 1904 suffering from anaemia. Noel was readmitted several times {{over the next three years}} for [...] "muscular rheumatism" [...] and [...] "bilious attacks" [...] but completed his studies and returned to the capital of Grenada (St. George's) to practice dentistry. He died of pneumonia in 1916 and is buried in the Catholic cemetery at Sauteurs in the north of Grenada. Shortly after the report by Herrick, another case appeared in the Virginia Medical Semi-Monthly with the same title, [...] "Peculiar Elongated and Sickle-Shaped Red Blood Corpuscles in a Case of Severe Anemia." [...] <b>This</b> <b>article</b> <b>is</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> a patient admitted to the University of Virginia Hospital on November 15, 1910. [...] In the later description by Verne Mason in 1922, the name [...] "sickle cell anemia" [...] is first used. Childhood problems related to sickle cells disease were not reported until the 1930s, despite the fact that this cannot have been uncommon in African-American populations.|$|E
