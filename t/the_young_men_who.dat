Calls to merchants came with {{requests}} for cigarettes and tobacco, while housewives were asked to contribute cake and cookies, with attempts to get the younger women to hand out the gifts and keep conversation up with the soldiers. The first meeting was held on December 22 for the canteen committee. Three days later, on Christmas day, the next train pulled into the city, surprising <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> were expecting just another boring stop. At first, the women worked out of the nearby Cody Hotel.

25|$|What {{seemed a}} mass {{movement}} toward practicality and specialization that would drain {{the university of}} the aestheticism and humanism frustrated <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> would eventually found the Monthly; each was involved {{with one or more}} of the other Harvard literary publications—the Lampoon, the Advocate, and the Crimson, which didn't offer the creative outlet they felt necessary. Toward the end of their junior year, W.W. Baldwin and T.P. Sanborn brainstormed in the latter's room in Grays Hall, proceeding to A.B. Houghton's room in Holyoke and, after gathering W.M. Fullerton and G.R. Carpenter, assembling in Santayana's room in Hollis Hall, where they agreed to move forward with a plan for a true literary magazine. They vowed their work would not bespeak the scrupulous consciousness of John Bunyan's Puritan Pilgrim, but rather the doubting scrutiny of William Dean Howells' Silas Lapham who, in Howells’ story, prevails over the empty, hypocritical norms of proper Boston society.|$|E

[...] Captured and imprisoned, Tresham appealed to Katherine Howard, but was rebuked. [...] His sister, Lady Mounteagle, alerted his cousin John Throckmorton, who turned to [...] "three most honorable parsons and one especiall instrument" [...] for help. [...] The identity of these individuals is unclear, but Tresham was promised freedom {{on the condition that}} over the next three months his father pay £2,100 to William Ayloffe, to [...] "save his lyef attainder in bloode." [...] He was released on 21June. [...] The experience did not dissuade him from engaging in further conspiracies; in 1602 and 1603 he was involved in the missions to Catholic Spain made by Thomas Wintour, Anthony Dutton (possibly an alias of Christopher Wright) and Guy Fawkes, later dubbed by the English government as the Spanish Treason. [...] However, upon James's accession to the throne, he told Thomas Wintour (secretary to Tresham's brother-in-law William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle), that he would [...] "stand wholly for the King", and [...] "to have no speech with him of Spain." ...|$|E

They were forced to climb nearly [...] through the jungles of the Western Ghat mountain ranges. It was [...] from Mangalore to Seringapatam, and the journey took six weeks. According to British Government records, 20,000 of them died on the march to Seringapatam. According to James Scurry, a British officer, who was held captive along with Mangalorean Catholics, 30,000of them were forcibly converted to Islam. The young women and girls were forcibly made wives of the Muslims living there and later distributed and sold in prostitution. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> offered resistance were disfigured by cutting their noses, upper lips, and ears.
