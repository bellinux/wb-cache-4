40|$|Introduction: The article {{deals with}} a {{linguistic}} approach to the <b>technological</b> <b>adjustment</b> of difficult harvesters in field conditions. The short characteristic of subject domain is provided. The place of the task of adjustment of the combine harvester working bodies in harvesting is considered. Various groups of signs of the considered task are allocated: external signs of violation of quality of work, regulated parameters of the machine, and parameters of technical condition. The numerical data characterizing interrelations between external signs and parameters of the machine are provided. Materials and Methods: A combine harvester is the difficult dynamic system functioning under constantly changing external conditions. This fact imposes characteristics on the used methods of <b>technological</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Quantitative and qualitative information is used to control harvesting. Availability {{of different types of}} uncertainty in considering semantic spaces of factors of the external environment and parameters of the machine allows offering the method of <b>technological</b> <b>adjustment</b> based on an indistinct logical conclusion for the solution of the task. Results: As the analysis result, the decision making methodology for indistinct environment conditions is adapted for the studied subject domain. The generalized scheme of indistinct management of process is offered to <b>technological</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the machine. Models of the studied semantic spaces are considered. Feasibility of use of deductive and inductive conclusions of decisions for various tasks of preliminary setup and adjustment of technological adjustments is shown. The formal and logical scheme of the decision making process based on indistinct expert knowledge is offered. The scheme includes the main stages of the task solution: fazzifikation, composition and defazzifikation. The question of the quantitative assessment of expert knowledge coordination is considered. The examples of the formulation of indistinct production rules, the knowledge base, and characteristics of an algorithm for adjusting of technological adjustments are given. Discussion and Conclusions: The linguistic approach to a <b>technological</b> <b>adjustment</b> of machines provides adequacy of the description of real conditions of cleaning, accounting both quantitative information and heuristic data. The model of subject domain the basis for creation of the knowledge base and the mechanism for conclusing provides solutions of the intellectual system of decision support by the operator when the functioning of combines...|$|E

40|$|This study {{extends the}} {{literature}} on interfuel substitution by investi-gating the role of transactions costs and <b>technological</b> <b>adjustment,</b> focus-ing specifically on differences across countries with different potential for fossil fuel production. We find that fossil fuel producing economies have higher elasticities of interfuel substitution. Our simulations show that, compared to the baseline case of uniform elasticities, energy and climate policies result in a greater substitution among different sources of energy for countries with larger potential to produce fossil fuels. These results are important because they imply lower economic cost for policies aimed at climate abatement and more efficient utilization of energy resources in energy-intensive economies...|$|E

40|$|The {{stabilisation}} {{of innovative}} technology depends on reconciling technological opportunities and user behaviour. This {{can be achieved}} by adjusting the technology to the users, by configuring the user, or by a combination thereof. This paper evaluates different strategies in a case of service innovation: the substitution of conductors with self-service machines in the Amsterdam tramways around 1970 and the various forms of fare-dodging that came along. To counteract fare-dodging, the transport company unsuccessfully relied on a strategy to configure users. Alternative strategies, notably configuring users through <b>technological</b> <b>adjustment,</b> are suggested to increase the chance of stabilisation. These observations and suggestions are related to the actual characteristics of services: given that transport services are immediately and collectively used, their misuse, if not corrected by fellow passengers, soon tends to threaten the aspect of stability.

We characterize an equilibrium model of bidding into this uniform-price divisible-good auction market. Using detailed firm-level data on bids and marginal costs of generation, we find that firms with large stakes in the market performed close to theoretical benchmarks of static, profit-maximizing bidding derived from our model. However, several smaller firms utilized excessively steep bid schedules that deviated significantly from our theoretical benchmarks, {{in a manner that}} could not be empirically accounted for by the presence of <b>technological</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs, transmission constraints, or collusive behavior. Our results suggest that payoff scale matters in firms' willingness and ability to participate in complex, strategic market environments. Finally, although smaller firms moved closer to theoretical bidding benchmarks over time, their bidding patterns contributed to productive inefficiency in this newly restructured market, along with efficiency losses due to the close-to optimal exercise of market power by larger firms. ...|$|E

In order to empirically test if technical changes are associated with the variation of employment levels and skills, a survey application to a sample of 167 SMEs from textile, clothes and leather (TCL) sectors located in Southern Europe is used. Using statistical procedures, the importance of several predictor variables to the variation of firms’ employment was evaluated. The results confirm that technical change is both skill-biased as well as positively associated with employment growth. Firms investing in new plant and equipment and firms investing in the development of new products are more likely to increase employment than the others. Also, firms hiring in these sectors, look for adequate qualifications, in particular regarding the ability to work with internet tools.

40|$|The {{importance}} of the textile, clothing and leather (TCL) sectors in Europe is obvious. As an industry based predominantly on small and medium-sized enterprises(SME) with an annual turnover of more than € 230 billion produced by around 273 000 enterprises, these sectors employ more than 3 {{million people in the}} European Union (EU) - 27. The liberalization process following the signing of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement has increased import penetration in these sectors, with the EU industry experiencing serious difficulties in competing with foreign operators working with lower labour costs and less stringent social and environmental regulations (COM, 2004). These new economic conditions have been forcing a restructuring in these industries. The ability to react and to adjust technologically to the challenges of these harder market conditions is what determines whether a region is a producer of high-value- added goods or a mere subcontractor. Although delocalization is a common threat, industrial agglomerations in low-cost countries are related to inferior working conditions, while in economically advanced countries the expansion of more skilled forms of work in the fashion-intensive production centres could compensate the further job loss. In fact, alternative employment opportunities may arise from complementary areas linked to technological innovations, and although one can expect further job decline in manufacturing productive units, the creation of high-qualification jobs in complementary areas, such as design, marketing, retail and management, may also be expected (Scott, 2006). The first objective of the present research is to describe the process of adoption of new technologies in the TCL sectors from a group of southern European regions. The way technological capabilities depend on localized assets is debated, and the evolutionary economics perspective is used to understand how regions are able to adapt to change, given their history. As argued by Bristow (2010), regional economic resilience is best understood when it is related to place-specific assets. The second objective is to observe the impacts of <b>technological</b> <b>adjustment</b> strategies on local labour demand. Manufacturing activities, like TCL, that are very susceptible to offshoring to low-wage countries, rely on the low level of territorialization and the low level of transaction costs(Storper, 1999, 2000). This situation allows low-wage product competition, and, when measured in terms of its impact on labour markets in developed countries, it creates low-wage competition for about 5 per cent of its workforce (Revenga, 1992). On this issue, we argue that <b>technological</b> <b>adjustment</b> strategies in the TCL sectors are decisive for regional employment and income perspectives because they provide alternative pathways for competitiveness in regions where low-cost strategies are not able to supply competitive advantages...|$|E

Worker autonomy, the control that workers have over their own work situation, is claimed in this essay {{to be a key}} determinant for the quality of work, as well as an important moral goal. Digital networks pose significant threats to worker autonomy as well as opportunities for its enhancement. In this essay, the notion of worker autonomy is analyzed and evaluated for its importance and moral relevance. It is then considered how digital networks both threaten worker autonomy and offer opportunities for its enhancement. Three major opportunities (enhanced communicative powers, increased informedness, teleworking) and threats (electronic monitoring, task prestructuring, and dependency creation) are discussed and analyzed. Finally, the dynamics that determine the impact on worker autonomy of the introduction of a digital network in organizations are investigated. A particular model for analyzing these dynamics and their impacts, Bryan Pfaffenberger's model of a technological drama. It will be illustrated how this model illuminates these dynamics by analyzing them as a dialectic of strategies of technological regularization by design constituencies and <b>technological</b> <b>adjustment</b> by impact constituencies.

40|$|It {{is common}} {{political}} practice {{to blame the}} presently poor performance of OECD economies on huge raw material price increases during the 70 s. This view is apparently backed by recent small-country oil-shock analysis showing within theoretical models how trade deficits and output and employment losses inevitably occur in net oil importing countries. The paper argues that, by its very nature, an oil shock afflicts an OECD country not in isolation. This requires theoretical analysis of an oil-importing economy together with its major trading partners. The paper demonstrates that due to a country-specific superior <b>technological</b> <b>adjustment</b> the oil shock may possibly give a competitive edge to one country {{or a group of}} OECD countries. Then a trade diversion among trading OECD economies benefits a few of them {{at the expense of other}} and may be strong enough to weaken or even turn around negative output and employment effects which originated from the real income trasnfer towards oil producers. Additionally, assessment of real and price level effects of an exchange rate change reveals that in general the beggar-my-neighbor property of a devaluation can be destroyed if imported intermediate goods like oil are taken into account. This outcome should also have some bearing on economic modelling of transatlantic relations under flexible exchange rates. Published in connection with a visit at the IIE...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic two sector, two skill groups model of endogenous skill and sector specific technological change. The sectors {{refer to a}} "high-tech” and a "low-tech” sector of an economy. The direction of technological change is driven by market forces determined by the skill composition of the work force. It is shown that a change in this skill composition - a higher growth rate of the high skilled workforce in the "high-tech” sector than in the "low-tech” sector - leads to an increasing relative wage of the high skilled {{despite the fact that}} the aggregate supply of the high skilled might rise. This directed <b>technological</b> <b>adjustment</b> can easily overcome the usual substitution effect which would lead the relative wage to fall. The important result of the model is that the result does not depend on high values of the elasticity of substitution as necessary in other models of directed technological change, e. g. Acemoglu (1998, 2001). Further some of these models can be interpreted as special cases of the present model. Some open economy extensions show how effects of the mentioned change in the skill composition of the work force can spill over from one country to another if both countries engage in free trade and if the state of technology is determined globally. wage inequality, directed technological change, endogenous growth, international trade...|$|E

In order to fill part of this gap, this study sought to determine the effect of both the concentration of antifoam and the use of a flocculant (Heliocarpus popayanensis Kunth) and an adjuvant (lime) on the quality of sugar honey and panela, when evaporation is performed at different atmospheric pressures. In order to achieve this, the present study worked on two completely randomized experimental designs with four replications, a density of evaporation heat flow of 27. 78 kW/m 2 and juice from the CC 85 - 46 variety. In the first design, two variables were studied: evaporation pressure and use of flocculant and adjuvant with a 4 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement without antifoam. In the second design, variables evaporation pressure and quantity of antifoam with a 4 x 3 factorial arrangement without flocculant nor adjuvant were studied. The results show that the quality of the product deteriorates in pressurized systems (glucoside coefficient increases up to 200 %), is not affected by the use of 50 μL of antifoam per liter of clarified juice and improved by the use of flocculant (turbidity is reduced by 55 %).

Human population level has varied in response to these external changes in ecosystems, but the adoption of maize agriculture {{during the late}} Holocene also resulted in a substantial population increase. This study demonstrates the long-term interconnectedness of prehistoric human cultures and the ecosystems they inhabited, and provides a consolidated environmental-cultural framework from which more interdisciplinary research and discussion can develop. Moreover, it emphasizes the complex nature of human responses to environmental change in a temperate region...|$|R
