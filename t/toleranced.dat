30|$|Recent {{works on}} <b>tolerancing</b> include <b>tolerance</b> {{analysis}} simulation {{during the initial}} design phase by a computer-aided <b>tolerancing</b> software (Barbero et al. 2015). The design <b>tolerances</b> estimated through this simulation subsequently determine the manufacturing <b>tolerances.</b> In another approach, complex workpiece with intricate shapes are classified based on its overall discrete geometry and <b>tolerance</b> analysis is performed on this overall part geometry (Schleich and Wartzack 2014). This simplifies the <b>tolerance</b> analysis for non-ideal complex workpiece shapes. Louhichi et al. (2015) performed realistic part <b>tolerancing</b> taking CAD part geometrical discrepancies into consideration. They identified the future research work as <b>tolerance</b> allocation by taking the manufacturing variations into consideration, which is also addressed in this paper. Considering this literature review, it can be summarized that the works on process <b>tolerancing</b> concentrated on the aspects of <b>tolerance</b> synthesis through <b>tolerance</b> chain and <b>tolerance</b> charting. In the pursuit for striking the balance between the conflicting issues of quality and cost, part <b>tolerancing</b> is optimized keeping the manufacturing process into consideration.|$|R

5000|$|For longer life, {{set screws}} are usually made {{of alloy steel}} and case hardened. Hardened set screws often leave a plastic deformation, {{in the form of}} a {{circular}} or semicircular mark, in the shaft that the screw sets against. This has both pros and cons. On the pro side, such deformation increases the holding power (torque resistance) of the joint, as the screw is essentially [...] "making its own detent" [...] on a small but effective scale. On the con side, if one is aiming to have a blemish-free cosmetic finish on the part being set against, one must take actions to prevent the circular marks. In most set screw applications, this consideration is irrelevant. Another con is that this plastic deformation can cause corresponding high points in the shaft surrounding the circular mark. This can result in difficulties during dis-assembly if a bearing or other tightly <b>toleranced</b> part needs to slide past this area. Use of a flat mitigates this problem.|$|E
30|$|The vital {{governing}} factor {{influencing the}} machining excellence is the geometric and dimensional <b>tolerance</b> embedded into the product {{as well as}} into the process. The two main facets of <b>tolerancing</b> include the arithmetic and statistical <b>tolerancing.</b> In arithmetic <b>tolerancing</b> {{it is assumed that}} the detail part dimension can have any value but within the <b>tolerance</b> range; whereas, in the statistical <b>tolerancing</b> scheme, it is assumed that detail part dimensions vary randomly according to a normal distribution, centered at the mid-point of the <b>tolerance</b> range and with its ± 3 σ spread covering the <b>tolerance</b> interval.|$|R
30|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of arithmetic <b>tolerancing</b> or worst-case <b>tolerancing</b> {{is that it}} does not follow any trend or pattern within the <b>tolerance</b> zone and part dimensions resulting from the machining process can possess any value within the <b>tolerance</b> zone. This results in checking up of each individual dimension for its correctness within the <b>tolerance</b> zone, which is impractical in mass production. The statistical <b>tolerance</b> overcomes this drawback of arithmetic <b>tolerance</b> and facilitates the machining to yield dimensions according to a normal distribution. Also statistical <b>tolerancing</b> allows some cancellation of variation from normal distribution. Hence, this paper in essence reflects the theme of statistical <b>tolerancing.</b>|$|R

Evidence that chronic inflammation contributes to the neuropathology of prevalent neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases suggests that inflammatory <b>tolerance</b> mechanisms are often inadequate to control detrimental inflammation in the central nervous system. Thus, identifying mechanisms that regulate neuroinflammatory <b>tolerance</b> may reveal opportunities for bolstering <b>tolerance</b> to reduce chronic inflammation in these diseases. Examination of <b>tolerance</b> after repeated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of mouse primary astrocytes demonstrated that histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity promoted <b>tolerance,</b> opposite to the action of glycogen synthase kinase- 3 (GSK 3), which counteracts <b>tolerance.</b> HDAC 6 in particular was found to be critical for <b>tolerance</b> induction, as its deacetylation of acetyl-tubulin was increased during LPS <b>tolerance,</b> this was enhanced by inhibition of GSK 3, and the HDAC 6 inhibitor tubacin completely blocked <b>tolerance</b> and the promotion of <b>tolerance</b> by inhibition of GSK 3. These results reveal opposing interactions between HDAC 6 and GSK 3 in regulating <b>tolerance,</b> and indicate that shifting the balance between these two opposing forces on inflammatory <b>tolerance</b> can obliterate or enhance <b>tolerance</b> to LPS in astrocytes...|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the divided {{combustion}} chamber is {{to speed up the}} combustion process, in order to increase the power output by increasing engine speed. The addition of a prechamber, however, increases heat loss to the cooling system and thereby lowers engine efficiency. The engine requires glow plugs for starting. In an indirect injection system the air moves fast, mixing the fuel and air. This simplifies injector design and allows the use of smaller engines and less tightly <b>toleranced</b> designs which are simpler to manufacture and more reliable. Direct injection, by contrast, uses slow-moving air and fast-moving fuel; both the design and manufacture of the injectors is more difficult. The optimisation of the in-cylinder air flow is much more difficult than designing a prechamber. There is much more integration between the design of the injector and the engine. It {{is for this reason that}} car diesel engines were almost all indirect injection until the ready availability of powerful CFD simulation systems made the adoption of direct injection practical.|$|E

40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of large protein assemblies {{is a major}} challenge due to their plasticity and due to {{the flexibility of the}} proteins involved. An emerging trend to cope with these uncertainties consists of performing the reconstruction by integrating experimental data from several sources, a strategy recently used to propose qualitative reconstructions of the Nuclear Pore Complex. Yet, the absence of clearly identified canonical reconstructions and the lack of quantitative assessment with respect to the experimental data are detrimental to the mechanistic exploitation of the results. To leverage such reconstructions, this work proposes a modeling framework inherently accommodating uncertainties, and allowing a precise assessment of the reconstructed models. We make three contributions. First, we introduce <b>toleranced</b> models to accommodate the positional and conformational uncertainties of protein instances within large assemblies. A <b>toleranced</b> model is a continuum of geometries whose distinct topologies can be enumerated, and mining stable complexes amidst this finite set hints at important structures in the assembly. Second, we present a panoply of tools to perform a multi-scale topological, geometric, and biochemical assessment of the complexes associated to a <b>toleranced</b> model, at the assembly and local levels. At the assembly level, we assess the prominence of contacts {{and the quality of the}} reconstruction, in particular w. r. t symmetries. At the local level, the complexes encountered in the <b>toleranced</b> model are used to confirm / question / suggest protein contacts within a known 3 D template known at atomic resolution. Third, we apply our machinery to the NPC for which we (i) report prominent contacts uncovering sub-complexes of the NPC, (ii) explain the closure of the two rings involving 16 copies of the Y-complex, and (iii) develop a new 3 D template for the T-complex.

The genetic lines were derived from crosses between individuals from an uncontaminated pasture, a copper mine (Copperopolis) and a serpentine region in California, U. S. A. The populations were initially screened for <b>tolerance</b> to Co, Cr, Hg, Ni and Zn. The serpentine population exhibited the highest <b>tolerance</b> to nickel and the Copperopolis population showed the highest chromium <b>tolerance.</b> Individuals from the Copperopolis mine and serpentine populations that showed high <b>tolerance</b> to nickel were crossed to a non-tolerant (CL 40) and between each other to obtain the F 1 generation and the progeny were screened for <b>tolerance</b> to the 12 metals.
