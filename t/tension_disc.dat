However, the effect of oxygen <b>tension</b> on <b>disc</b> cell senescence was unknown. Herein, rat nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were cultured under 20 % O 2 or 1 % O 2. Consequently, ROS induced by 20 % O 2 caused DNA damage and then activated p 53 -p 21 -Rb and p 16 -Rb pathways via ERK signaling to induce NP cell senescence. It also induced catabolic and proinflammatory phenotype of NP cells via MAPK and NF-κB pathways. Furthermore, 20 % O 2 was found to upregulate Nox 4 in NP cells. Small interfering RNA against Nox 4 reduced ROS production induced by 20 % O 2 and consequently suppressed premature senescence of NP cells. On the contrary, NP cells overexpressing Nox 4 produced more ROS and rapidly developed senescent signs. In consistent with the in vitro studies, the expression of Nox 4, p 21, and Rb was upregulated in rat degenerative discs. This study, for the first time, demonstrates that Nox 4 is an oxygen-sensing enzyme and a main ROS source in NP cells. Nox 4 -dependent ROS are genotoxic and a potent trigger of NP cell senescence.

These two areas often have also different organic matter contents and soil compaction properties, and hence also soil hydraulic properties, thus causing further {{differences in the}} local infiltration rates close to and away from trees. In this study we analyzed possible differences in the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties of the stemflow and throughfall areas below an oil palm tree. <b>Tension</b> <b>disc</b> infiltrometer experiments were carried out underneath the canopy and in the interspace area of an oil palm tree plantation at successive tensions of 5, 2, and 0 cm.

Two types of global overstable modes exist in such systems, the interface modes and the disc inertial-acoustic modes. We examine various physical effects and parameters that influence the properties of these oscillation modes, particularly their growth rates, including the magnetosphere field configuration, the velocity and density contrasts across the magnetosphere-disc interface, the rotation profile (with Newtonian or General Relativistic potential), the sound speed and magnetic field of the disc. The interface modes are driven unstable by Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz in- stabilities, but can be stabilized by the toroidal field (through magnetic <b>tension)</b> and <b>disc</b> differential rotation (through finite vorticity). General relativity increases their growth rates by modifying the disc vorticity outside the magnetosphere boundary.

40|$|International audienceRunoff {{is one of}} {{the main}} factors {{controlling}} gully development. Concentrated flow erosion occurs where flow discharge and velocity exceed critical values. In Southern French Alps, in black marl gully catchments, runoff from hillslopes occurs in the form of Hortonian overland flow because rainfall intensities exceed the infiltration capacity of the soil. In such a situation, spatial variability of infiltration capacities is critical for describing the runoff production. This study reports detailed field measurements of near-saturation and saturated infiltration properties: capillary sorptivity (S) and hydraulic conductivity (K). A total of 140 infiltration tests were conducted using <b>tension</b> <b>disc</b> and ponded ring infiltrometers on 6 different regoliths (weathering profile) encountered in a marly gully catchment. The main objectives were to improve our knowledge of the spatial variability of infiltration in black marl areas and to compare different field and data analysis methods. Hydraulic conductivity values K(h) at supply pressure heads (h) ranging from h = − 100 up to h = 0 mm were calculated using steady state flow and Wooding's equation [Wooding, R. A., 1968. Steady infiltration from shallow circular pond. Water Resour. Res. 4 (6), 1259 – 1273]. K(h = 0 mm) was also estimated from the ponded ring infiltrometer data set. The estimation of sorptivity was based on transient flow and the solution of Haverkamp et al. [Haverkamp, R., Roos, P. J., Smettem, K. R. J., Parlange, J. Y., 1994. Three dimensional analysis of infiltration from the disc infiltrometer. 2. Physical based infiltration equation. Water Resour. Res. 30 (11), 2931 – 2935]. Three methods were used to analyse <b>tension</b> <b>disc</b> infiltrometer data: multiple radii, multiple potential and single test. Only the multiple radii method was found not suitable in our context due to a large spatial variability in the infiltration properties over small distances.

This result confirms the role played by structural voids when the regolith is at near saturation. The dispersion of the estimates of field saturated hydraulic conductivity is larger than unsaturated values. The spatial differences found are explained by the topographical position and by the regolith structure observed for the 6 sites.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} an automated method of measuring water level changes in Mariotte-type reservoirs via time domain reflectometry (TDR) and demonstrates its field application for measurements of soil hydraulic properties. The method {{is based on the assumption}} that the travel time of a TDR pulse propagating along a transmission line immersed in an air-water medium is the summation of the pulse travel times in the air and water phases. A TDR cable tester generates a pulse that propagates through a three-rod probe traversing the centre of the Mariotte reservoir from top to bottom. The reflection of the pulse is automatically transferred to a computer for waveform analysis with the water level being a simple function of probe length and the air, water, and air-water medium dielectric constants as measured by the cable tester. Water level measurements obtained with the TDR technique showed close agreement with those obtained using visual and pressure transducer procedures.

We attribute the difference between the dynamic BD results and the direct tension results to the overload and internal friction in BD tests. The difference between the dynamic SCB results and the direct tension results can be understood by invoking the non-local failure theory.

40|$|Abstract — Pirn winding is an {{operation}} of winding yarn from supply yarn package onto pirns {{which are used}} for shuttle weft insertion. Firm and coherent winding tension is required to maintain in the pirn winding process to withstand the high forces produced by the deceleration of the shuttle {{at the end of}} each pick and to avoid permanent strains in yarns which will appears as fabric defects in weaving. The package size and its diameter vary due to subsequent winding of pirns. Hence the balloon effect varies and caused to change the thread tension at the winding point of the pirn. The thread tension variation is considerably significant from the first pirn wound from a package to the last pirn wound from the same if no tension controlling mechanism is devised. Placing dead weights on the <b>disc</b> <b>tension</b> controller which adds a tension to take off tension may help to compensate the yarn tension variation to some extent to combat with this problem. However, this is a stepwise manual compensation technique which needs the correct timing of compensation to avoid significant tension variations in pirn windings.

Macropores are important flowpaths in the upper layers of blanket peat and were investigated through the use of <b>tension</b> <b>disc</b> infiltrometers, which also provide data on saturated hydraulic conductivity. Measurements were performed on unburnt peat (U), where prescribed burning had taken place 2 years (B 2), 4 years (B 4) and > 15 (B 15 +) years prior to sampling, and where a wildfire (W) had taken place 4 months prior to sampling. Where there had been recent burning (B 2, B 4 and W), saturated hydraulic conductivity was approximately three times lower than where there was no burning (U) or where burning was last conducted > 15 years ago (B 15 +). Similarly, the contribution of macropore flow to overall infiltration was significantly lower (between 12 % and 25 % less) in the recently burnt treatments compared to B 15 + and U. There {{were no significant differences in}} saturated hydraulic conductivity or macropore flow between peat that had been subject to recent wildfire (W) and those that had undergone recent prescribed burning (B 2 and B 4).

Monitoring the plot showed that the BOF slag studied crusted at the surface {{as a result of}} weathering processes. Numerical inversion proved that the crusted material differed from the unaltered slag in terms of water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions.

In this study we attempt to image water infiltration dynamics under a tension infiltrometer in a vertical two-dimensional (2 D) plane using electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). Two-dimensional images of soil electrical resistivity at different times were obtained using a Wenner array with 32 electrodes and a 10 -cm spacing during the infiltration of a Cl– or Br– solution at 0. 36 and 0. 34 M, respectively. This procedure allowed monitoring {{the development of the}} infiltration bulb through time. Both unipotential and multipotential infiltrations were performed and used to derive soil hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity values. Anion concentrations in soil samples taken after infiltration were compared with resistivity values obtained with ERT measurements.

Twenty eyes served as controls. The average total slope angle and sector based slope angle of the cup, total contour area, effective area, neuroretinal rim area, half depth area, cup to disc ratio, contour variation, mean contour depth, average depth, volume below, half depth volume, and contour tilt were evaluated with a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope.  RESULTS—The earliest changes in eyes with OHND or OHD started in the slope at the nasal inferior sector (p< 0. 05), followed by the superior and temporal superior sectors (p< 0. 05). The mean slopes in eyes with NTD and OHD were steeper than in controls (p< 0. 05). Statistically {{significant differences were found}} between controls and disease groups in the half depth area, mean contour depth, and half depth volume. The cup to disc ratios in eyes with OHD and NTD were greater than in eyes with OHND; the volume below was greater in eyes with NTD than in eyes with OHND and OHD.  CONCLUSIONS—The steep slope in the nasal inferior section is the first indicator of glaucomatous nerve defects in many eyes. The half depth parameters, half depth area, and half depth volume may be useful for distinguishing ocular hypertension with and without glaucomatous disc changes. ...|$|R

A <b>tension</b> <b>disc</b> infiltrometer was used at two soil water pressure heads (- 5 cm, and 0) to infer &# 952;M and K, during fallow. Macroporosity was determined based on the flow contribution between 0 and - 5 cm water potentials (K 0, K 5, respectively), according to the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The K 0 values were statistically higher for CT than for NT and CP. The K 5 values did not differ statistically among treatments. The mean K values varied between 0. 20 and 3. 70 cm/h. For CT, &# 952;M was significantly greater than for CP and NT, following the same trend as K 0. No differences in &# 952;M were detected between CP and NT. With CT, the formation of water-conducting macropores with persistence until post-harvest was possible, while under CP preparation, the water-conducting macropores were not persistent. These results support the idea that tillage affects the soil water movement mainly by the resulting water-conducting macropores. Future studies on tillage effects on water movement should focus on macroporosity...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at: [URL] paper describes {{the use of}} an automated method of measuring water level changes in Mariotte-type reservoirs via time domain reflectometry (TDR) and demonstrates its field application for measurements of soil hydraulic properties. The method {{is based on the assumption}} that the travel time of a TDR pulse propagating along a transmission line immersed in an air–water medium is the summation of the pulse travel times in the air and water phases. A TDR cable tester generates a pulse that propagates through a three-rod probe traversing the centre of the Mariotte reservoir from top to bottom. The reflection of the pulse is automatically transferred to a computer for waveform analysis with the water level being a simple function of probe length and the air, water, and air–water medium dielectric constants as measured by the cable tester. Water level measurements obtained with the TDR technique showed close agreement with those obtained using visual and pressure transducer procedures. The application of this TDR method as an alternative to more traditional methods was demonstrated in a field experiment using a <b>tension</b> <b>disc</b> infiltrometer. The TDR approach allows for automated water level measurements and is simple, accurate and easy to implement. Moreover, it allows for simultaneous TDR measurements of both water flow and volumetric water content of soil below the infiltrometer disc.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{concept of}} soil {{physical}} quality (SPQ) is currently under discussion, and an agreement about which soil physical properties {{should be included}} in the SPQ characterization has not been reached. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the ability of SPQ indicators based on static and dynamic soil properties to assess the effects of two loosening treatments (chisel plowing to 0. 20 m [ChT] and subsoiling to 0. 35 m [DL]) on a soil under NT and to compare the performance of static- and dynamic-based SPQ indicators to define soil proper soil conditions for soybean yield. Soil sampling and field determinations were carried out after crop harvest. Soil water retention curve was determined using a tension table, and field infiltration was measured using a <b>tension</b> <b>disc</b> infiltrometer. Most dynamic SPQ indicators (field saturated hydraulic conductivity, K 0, effective macroporosity, εma, total connectivity and macroporosity indexes [CwTP and Cwmac]) were affected by the studied treatments, and were greater for DL compared to NT and ChT (K 0 values were 2. 17, 2. 55, and 4. 37 cm h- 1 for NT, ChT, and DL, respectively). However, static SPQ indicators (calculated from the water retention curve) were not capable of distinguishing effects among treatments. Crop yield was significantly lower for the DL treatment (NT: 2, 400 kg ha- 1; ChT: 2, 358 kg ha- 1; and DL: 2, 105 kg ha 1), in agreement with significantly higher values of the dynamic SPQ indicators, K 0, εma, CwTP, and Cwmac, in this treatment. The results support the idea that SPQ indicators based on static properties are not capable of distinguishing tillage effects and predicting crop yield, whereas dynamic SPQ indicators are useful for distinguishing tillage effects and can explain differences in crop yield when used together with information on weather conditions. However, future studies, monitoring years with different weather conditions, would be useful for increasing knowledge on this topic...|$|E

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at: [URL] is limited {{information on the}} effects of tillage practices on soil hydraulic properties, especially changes with time. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate on a long-term field experiment the influence of conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT) and no-tillage (NT) on the dynamics of soil hydraulic properties over 3 consecutive 16 – 18 month fallow periods. Surface measurements of soil dry bulk density (ρb), soil hydraulic conductivity (K(ψ)) at − 14, − 4, − 1 and 0 cm pressure heads using a <b>tension</b> <b>disc</b> infiltrometer, and derived hydraulic parameters (pore size, number of pores per unit of area and water-transmission porosity) calculated using the Poiseuille's Law were taken on four different dates over the fallow period, namely, before and immediately after primary tillage, after post-tillage rains and at the end of fallow. Under consolidated structured soil conditions, NT plots presented the most compacted topsoil layer when compared with CT and RT. Soil hydraulic conductivity under NT was, for the entire range of pressure head applied, significantly lower (P < 0. 05) than that measured for CT and RT. However, NT showed the largest mean macropore size (0. 99, 0. 95 and 2. 08 mm for CT, RT and NT, respectively; P < 0. 05) but the significantly lowest number of water-conducting pores per unit area (74. 1, 118. 5 and 1. 4 macropores per m 2 for CT, RT and NT, respectively; P < 0. 05). Overall, water flow was mainly regulated by macropores even though they represented a small fraction of total soil porosity. No significant differences in hydraulic properties were found between CT and RT. In the short term, tillage operations significantly increased K (P < 0. 05) for the entire range of pressure head applied, which was likely a result of an increase in water-conducting mesopores despite a decrease in estimated mesopore diameter. Soil reconsolidation following post-tillage rains reduced K at a rate that increased with the intensity of the rainfall events.

40|$|Unsaturated {{hydraulic}} conductivity {{was measured using}} four different methods. Tension permeameters were used to measure unsaturated {{hydraulic conductivity}} in the field, using a single disc method, which depends on the measurements of sorptivity, steady state flow rate, initial and final water content (White and Perroux, 1987, 1989). Also, a double disc method was used which utilizes Wooding's (1968) equation for two different disc radii at the same tension for steady state flow rates. Undisturbed and disturbed soil cores were used to measure unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in the lab, using water retention curves with van Genuchten's equations. There {{were no significant differences}} in the mean of hydraulic conductivity between single and double disc methods in all the tensions used (0, 5, 10 and 15 cm). There were significant differences between the field methods and undisturbed soil cores in zero cm tension, and disturbed soil cores in 10 and 15 cm tension. The effect of land preparation on the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was studied using the double disc method. Tilling has significant effects on the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at all tensions used. The spatial variation of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and steady state flow in different tensions using the double disc method was studied. We found exponential variogram models for unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at 5, 10 and 15 cm tensions and a random model for zero cm tension. Also, exponential models were best fitted for steady state flow corresponding to pores radii of 0. 03 - 0. 015 cm, 0. 015 - 0. 010 cm and steady state flow at 10 cm tension. A Michaelis-Menton model was used for steady state flow at 5 cm and 15 cm <b>tension.</b> <b>Disc</b> permeameters were also used to add 5 cm depth of water, bromide and dye solution at 0, 5, 10 and 15 cm tensions with three replicates. A comparison was made between field data and simulated model under the same boundary and initial conditions as in the field. Results showed that the water and bromide move deeper than the prediction of the simulated model in all tensions used. The differences were larger between simulated model and field data for both water and bromide concentrations in the lower tension and smaller in the higher tension as a result of elimination of some preferential flow paths. An equation was developed for cumulative infiltration valid for both small and large time. The parameters calculated using the developed equation closely matched the measured infiltration, and fit better than a three term series similar to the Philip equation for one-dimensional flow...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the soil macropore network determine the potential for fast transport of agrochemicals and contaminants through the soil. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the relationships between macropore network characteristics, hydraulic properties and state variables and measures of preferential transport. Experiments were carried out under near-saturated conditions on undisturbed columns sampled from four agricultural topsoils of contrasting texture and structure. Macropore network characteristics were computed from 3 -D X-ray tomography images of the soil pore system. Non-reactive solute transport experiments were carried out at five steady-state water flow rates from 2 to 12 mm h − 1. The degree of preferential transport was evaluated by the normalised 5 % solute arrival time and the apparent dispersivity calculated from the resulting breakthrough curves. Near-saturated hydraulic conductivities were measured on the same samples using a <b>tension</b> <b>disc</b> infiltrometer placed on top of the columns. Results showed that many of the macropore network characteristics were inter-correlated. For example, large macroporosities were associated with larger specific macropore surface areas and better local connectivity of the macropore network. Generally, an increased flow rate resulted in earlier solute breakthrough and a shifting of the arrival of peak concentration towards smaller drained volumes. Columns with smaller macroporosities, poorer local connectivity of the macropore network and smaller near-saturated hydraulic conductivities exhibited a greater degree of preferential transport. This can be explained by the fact that, with only two exceptions, global (i. e. sample scale) continuity of the macropore network was still preserved at low macroporosities. Thus, for any given flow rate, pores of larger diameter were actively conducting solute in soils of smaller near-saturated hydraulic conductivity. This was associated with larger local transport velocities and, hence, less time for equilibration between the macropores and the surrounding matrix which made the transport more preferential. Conversely, the large specific macropore surface area and well-connected macropore networks associated with columns with large macroporosities limit the degree of preferential transport because they increase the diffusive flux between macropores and the soil matrix and they increase the near-saturated hydraulic conductivity. The normalised 5 % arrival times were most strongly correlated with the estimated hydraulic state variables (e. g. with the degree of saturation in the macropores R 2 = 0. 589), since these combine into one measure the effects of irrigation rate and the near-saturated hydraulic conductivity function, which in turn implicitly depends on the volume, size distribution, global continuity, local connectivity and tortuosity of the macropore network...|$|E
40|$|Tillage methods affect soil {{physical}} properties and, thus, {{have a direct}} influence on the replenishment and depletion of soil water storage and crop performance. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the effects of traditional and conservation tillage on soil {{physical properties}}, soil water replenishment and depletion, and crop development and yield under southern Spanish conditions. The experiments were carried out from 1992 to 1995 in a sandy clay loam soil (Xerofluvent). The traditional tillage (TT) method consisted mainly of the use of mouldboard ploughing, and the conservation tillage (CT) was characterized by not using mouldboard ploughing, by reduction of the number of tillage operations and leaving the crop residues on the surface as mulch. In both tillage treatments a wheat (Triticum aestivum, L.) -sunflower (Helianthus annuus, L.) crop rotation was established. In each treatment, systematic measurements of bulk density, resistance to penetration, infiltration rate and hydraulic conductivity (using <b>tension</b> <b>disc</b> infiltrometers) in the soil top layer were carried out. Changes in water profiles through the experimental period were also followed using a neutron probe. Crop development and yield were determined. The soil hulk density in the 0 to 20 cm layer was significantly higher in the CT than in the TT treatment, mainly after tillage operations (between 10 % and 24 % higher in CT than in TT). After 3 years of continuous tillage treatments, the soil bulk density did not increase. The resistance to penetration at any time was higher in the CT than in the TT treatment, but not always significantly different. Infiltration rates were significantly higher in the TT than in the CT treatment (about 35 % higher in TT than in CT). After 3 years of the tillage treatments the hydraulic conductivity of the soil surface layer, at a pressure head of 0 mm, was significantly higher in the CT (124 mm h- 1) than in the TT (66 mm h- 1). This is related to the existence of preferential paths created by an increase of the earthworm population in the CT treatment. Soil water profiles showed higher replenishment of soil water storage in the CT than in the TT treatment, particularly from October 1994 to June 1995 when the lowest precipitation of the experimental period was recorded. Plant height, leaf area index (LAI) and root length density (RLD) of the first sunflower crop were significantly higher in the TT than in the CT treatment. Nevertheless, the seed yield was slightly higher in the CT than in the TT treatment. In the second sunflower crop, plant height, LAI, RLD were significantly higher in the CT than in the TT treatment except early in the season, and yield was significantly (and extremely) higher in the CT (1521 kg ha- 1) than in the TT (473 kg ha- 1) treatment. During the wheat crop season, plant height and RLD were higher in the TT than in the CT treatment, but groin yield was again slightly higher in the CT than in the TT treatment. The conservation tillage applied seems to be highly effective in enhancing soil water recharge and water conservation, particularly in years with much lower than average precipitation.
