5|$|It is {{not known}} what human organs are {{affected}} by interaction with promethium; a possible candidate is the bone tissues. Sealed promethium-147 is not dangerous. However, if the packaging is damaged, then promethium becomes dangerous <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>and</b> humans. If radioactive contamination is found, the contaminated area should be washed with water and soap, but, even though promethium mainly affects the skin, the skin should not be abraded. If a promethium leak is found, the area should be identified as hazardous and evacuated, and emergency services must be contacted. No dangers from promethium aside from the radioactivity are known.|$|E

5|$|Although pest insects {{attract the}} most attention, many insects are {{beneficial}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>and</b> to humans. Some insects, like wasps, bees, butterflies and ants, pollinate flowering plants. Pollination is a mutualistic relationship between plants and insects. As insects gather nectar from different plants {{of the same}} species, they also spread pollen from plants on which they have previously fed. This greatly increases plants' ability to cross-pollinate, which maintains and possibly even improves their evolutionary fitness. This ultimately affects humans since ensuring healthy crops is critical to agriculture. As well as pollination ants help with seed distribution of plants. This helps to spread the plants, which increases plant diversity. This leads to an overall better environment. A serious environmental problem is the decline of populations of pollinator insects, {{and a number of}} species of insects are now cultured primarily for pollination management in order to have sufficient pollinators in the field, orchard or greenhouse at bloom time. Another solution, as shown in Delaware, has been to raise native plants to help support native pollinators like L. vierecki. Insects also produce useful substances such as honey, wax, lacquer and silk. Honey bees have been cultured by humans for thousands of years for honey, although contracting for crop pollination is becoming more significant for beekeepers. The silkworm has greatly affected human history, as silk-driven trade established relationships between China {{and the rest of the}} world.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ambient Intelligence is a {{research}} area that has gained {{a lot of attention}} in recent years. One of the most important issues for ambient intelligent systems is <b>to</b> perceive <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>and</b> assess occurring situations, thus allowing systems to behave intelligently. As the ambient intelligence area has been largely technology driven, the abilities of systems to understand their surroundings have largely been ignored. This work demonstrates the first steps towards an ambient intelligent system, which is able <b>to</b> appreciate <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>and</b> reason about occurring situations. This situation awareness is achieved through knowledge intensive case-based reasoning. ...|$|R
