5|$|In 1981, {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} revealed fine grooves or striations on <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> in lemuriform toothcombs. These grooves were only found {{on the sides of}} <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> on the concave surfaces between the sides, as well on the back ridge of <b>the</b> <b>teeth.</b> Between 10 and 20µm wide, these grooves indicate that hair moved repeatedly across <b>the</b> <b>teeth.</b> Inside these grooves were even finer grooves, less than 1µm, created by abrasion with the cuticular layer of the hair.|$|E
5|$|Toothache, {{also known}} as dental pain, is pain in <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> and/or their {{supporting}} structures, caused by dental diseases or pain referred to <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> by non-dental diseases.|$|E
5|$|A {{chattering}} {{sound is}} made by rapidly gnashing <b>the</b> <b>teeth,</b> and is generally a sign of warning. Guinea pigs tend to raise their heads when making this sound.|$|E
50|$|The white {{visible part}} of a <b>tooth</b> is called <b>the</b> crown. The rounded upper {{projections}} of <b>the</b> back <b>teeth</b> are cusps. <b>The</b> hard white exterior covering of <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> is <b>the</b> enamel. As <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> tapers below <b>the</b> gumline, the neck is formed. Below the neck, holding <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> into <b>the</b> bone, {{is the root of}} <b>the</b> <b>tooth.</b> <b>The</b> inner portions of <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> consist of <b>the</b> dentin, a bonelike tissue, and the pulp.

5|$|Crocodilian teeth {{vary from}} blunt and dull to sharp and needle-like. Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform. <b>The</b> <b>teeth</b> of {{crocodiles}} and gharials {{tend to be}} more visible than those of alligators and caimans when the jaws are closed. The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line. <b>The</b> <b>teeth</b> on the lower jaw of an alligator fit into sockets in the upper jaw, so only the upper teeth are visible when the mouth is closed. <b>The</b> <b>teeth</b> on the lower jaw of a crocodile fit into grooves {{on the outside of the}} top jaw making both the upper and lower teeth visible when the mouth is closed.|$|E
5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> {{found with}} the holotype {{specimen}} were not {{attached to the}} skull; a few remained in the upper jaw, and only small replacement teeth were in the lower jaw. <b>The</b> <b>teeth</b> had the shape of recurved cones, flattened somewhat sideways. The larger teeth were less recurved than the smaller ones, but were otherwise uniform. The roots were very long, and <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> slender. The carinae (edges) of <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> were finely serrated with denticles {{on the front and}} back. There were seven narrow, uniform denticles per millimetre (0.039in), more than in most theropods. Some of <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> were fluted, with six to eight ridges along the length of their inner sides and fine-grained enamel. The inner side of each tooth row had a bony wall. The number of teeth was large, with seven teeth in the right premaxilla (other theropods have three to five) and thirty-two in the dentary, where sixteen is typical. The lower jaw would have had sixty-four teeth, and the difference between the number of teeth in the upper and lower jaws is more pronounced than in other theropods. <b>The</b> <b>teeth</b> in the dentary were more densely packed than those in the maxilla, and probably smaller. The terminal rosette in the upper jaw had thirteen dental alveoli (tooth sockets), six on the left and seven on the right side; the first four were large (with the second and third the largest), while the fourth and fifth progressively decreased in size. The diameter of the largest was twice that of the smallest. The first four alveoli of the dentary (corresponding to the tip of the upper jaw) were the largest, with the rest more regular in size. Interdental plates were between the alveoli.|$|E
50|$|The TIFF {{fracture}} surface {{has a distinct}} plateau in the central part along <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> width and approximately mid-height of <b>the</b> <b>tooth.</b> In a close-up of the cross-section of the TIFF small wing cracks are observed.

5|$|The slender teeth had {{slightly}} curved crowns, {{which were}} oval in cross-section. <b>The</b> <b>teeth</b> {{in the lower}} jaw may have been 20–30% smaller {{than those in the}} upper jaw, but few are known, and they are of uncertain maturity. Apart from this, <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> were identical. Under each active tooth there was a column of nine replacement teeth within the jaw. With 68 columns in the upper jaws and 60 columns in the lower jaws, these so-called dental batteries (also present in hadrosaurs and ceratopsians) comprised a total of more than 500 active and replacement teeth. Dental batteries erupted in unison, not each column individually. The enamel on <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> of Nigersaurus was highly asymmetrical, ten times thicker on the outwards facing side than on the inner side. This condition is otherwise known only in advanced ornithischians.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>teeth</b> of Patagosaurus are {{reminiscent}} of more derived sauropods. They are similar in morphology to Euhelopus, being concave on one side as well as having crowns with fairly great expansions. They are also similar to Camarasaurus, although the latter genus has less of a concavity and expansion. <b>The</b> <b>teeth</b> also possess marginal denticles on the crown. Based on histological studies, an individual of Patagosaurus would have replaced all its teeth within 58 days, similar to 62 days for Camarasaurus, and 34 days for Diplodocus.|$|E
30|$|While the {{helical gear}} pair is {{transmitting}} the load, the leading end of <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> {{comes in contact}} first and the trailing end last. Thus <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> picks up load gradually and the contact progresses gradually along {{the whole range of}} <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> width that is in helical gear pair, sharing of load will take place based on the contact ratio, covering <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> face and flank.|$|R
500|$|When {{toothache}} {{results from}} dental trauma (regardless {{of the exact}} pulpal or periodontal diagnosis), the treatment and prognosis {{is dependent on the}} extent of damage to <b>the</b> <b>tooth,</b> <b>the</b> stage of development of <b>the</b> <b>tooth,</b> <b>the</b> degree of displacement or, when <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> is avulsed, <b>the</b> time out of the socket and the starting health of <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> and bone. [...] Because of the high variation in treatment and prognosis, dentists often use trauma guides to help determine prognosis and direct treatment decisions.|$|R
30|$|After debonding, <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> and bracket {{surfaces}} {{were examined}} with a stereomicroscope (Olympus Corp, Tokyo, Japan) under 40 × magnification.

The toothcomb of the colugos {{is generally}} considered {{to function as a}} toothcomb, but {{due to the lack of}} striations on <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> and no documented observations of toothcomb use during oral grooming, its use seems to be limited to food procurement.|$|E
5|$|Among the adapiforms, frugivory {{seems to}} have been the most common diet, {{particularly}} for medium-sized to large species, such as Cantius, Pelycodus and Cercamonius. Folivory was also common among the medium and large-sized adapiforms, including Smilodectes, Notharctus, Adapis and Leptadapis. Sharp cusps on <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> of some of the smaller adapiforms, such as Anchomomys and Donrussellia, indicate that they were either partly or primarily insectivorous.|$|E
5|$|Because {{scratches}} {{dominate the}} microwear texture of <b>the</b> <b>teeth,</b> Williams et al. suggested Edmontosaurus was a grazer {{instead of a}} browser, which would be predicted to have fewer scratches due to eating less abrasive materials. Candidates for ingested abrasives include silica-rich plants like horsetails and soil that was accidentally ingested due to feeding at ground level. The tooth structure indicates combined slicing and grinding capabilities.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>tooth</b> {{surfaces}} of crossed helical gears are an involute helicoid, therefore they contact {{each other at}} a single point on the contact line. It is well-known that <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> bearing is not good and sometimes causes tooth wear or failure. This paper explains how short, narrow, very biased <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> bearing becomes, using the third-order surface analysis of the hypoid gears, and it clarifies that the contact patterns of the two involute helicoids become elliptical and <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> bearing can be shown by an equiclearance line between <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> surface...|$|R
50|$|Junctional {{epithelium}} {{is derived}} from the reduced enamel epithelium (REE) during <b>tooth</b> development. Before <b>the</b> eruption of <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> and after enamel maturation, the ameloblasts secrete a basal lamina on <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> surface that serves {{as a part of the}} primary EA. As <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> actively erupts, <b>the</b> coronal part of the fused and surrounding epithelium peels back off the crown. The ameloblasts also develop hemidesmosomes for the primary EA and become firmly attached to the enamel surface. However, the cervical part of the fused tissue remains attached to the neck of <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> by <b>the</b> primary EA. This fused tissue, which remains near the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) after <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> erupts, serves as the initial JE of <b>the</b> <b>tooth,</b> creating <b>the</b> first tissue attached to <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> surface. This tissue is later replaced by a definitive JE as the root is formed.|$|R
50|$|An {{extraction}} {{can also}} serve as treatment for dental caries.

40|$|AbstractMice and rats, {{two species}} of rodents, show some dental {{similarities}} such as tooth number and cusp number, and differences such as tooth size and cusp size. In this study, <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> size, tooth number, cusp size and cusp number, which are four major factors of <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> patterning, were investigated by the heterospecific recombinations of tissues from <b>the</b> molar <b>tooth</b> germs of mice and rats.
