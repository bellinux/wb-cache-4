25|$|Another way of {{thinking}} about it is that <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> about the chance that the other side is black, it's about the chance that you drew the all black card. If you drew a black face, then it's twice as likely that that face belongs to the black card than the mixed card.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of rare {{diseases}} which resemble GH deficiency, including the childhood growth failure, facial appearance, delayed bone age, and low IGF levels. However, GH testing elicits normal or high levels of GH in the blood, demonstrating that <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> due to a deficiency of GH but rather to a reduced sensitivity to its action. Insensitivity to GH is traditionally termed Laron dwarfism, but over the last 15 years many different types of GH resistance have been identified, primarily involving mutations of the GH binding protein or receptors.|$|E

25|$|The {{very first}} step which is {{normally}} overlooked {{by the top}} level management is defining the exact problem. Though {{we think that the}} problem identification is obvious, many times it is not. The rational decision making model is a group-based decision making process. If <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> identified properly then we may face a problem as each and every member of the group might have a different definition of the problem. Hence, {{it is very important that}} the definition of the problem is the same among all group members. Only then is it possible for the group members to find alternate sources or problem solving in an effective manner.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversy}} {{concerns the}} fact that most traditional tests of APD use verbal materials. The British Society of Audiology has embraced Moore's (2006) recommendation that tests for APD should assess processing of non-speech sounds. The concern is that if verbal materials are used to test for APD, then children may fail because of limited language ability. An analogy may be drawn with trying to listen to sounds in a foreign language. It is much harder to distinguish between sounds or to remember a sequence of words in a language you do not know well: <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> an auditory one, but rather due to lack of expertise in the language.|$|E
25|$|Manufacturers {{point out}} {{that many of the}} {{products}} to be impacted are already making their way through the supply chain. As a result, much inventory that was legal prior to the signing of the law and was manufactured shortly thereafter will probably be on shelves as the deadlines approach. The Natural Resources Defense Council and Public Citizen apparently agree that these products are already in distribution, but believe that manufacturers should still be held liable. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the lead or phthalate content, as they imply, {{but the fact that the}} products must be tested to make sure they comply. There is also confusion of what products need a GCC and which do not. They have not been tested because the items generally do not contain hazardous materials; CPSC has been slow to define some of the accreditation or testing criteria; some of the low volume, low value items are not economical to test; and lot tracking methods would not allow some of the items to be tracked.|$|E

25|$|Another {{factor in}} {{addition}} to the packing shape and surface area that affects the performance of random or structured packing is the liquid and vapor distribution entering the packed bed. The number of theoretical stages required to make a given separation is calculated using a specific vapor to liquid ratio. If the liquid and vapor are not evenly distributed across the superficial tower area as it enters the packed bed, the liquid to vapor ratio will not be correct in the packed bed and the required separation will not be achieved. The packing will appear to not be working properly. The height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP) will be greater than expected. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the packing itself but the mal-distribution of the fluids entering the packed bed. Liquid mal-distribution is more frequently the problem than vapor. The design of the liquid distributors used to introduce the feed and reflux to a packed bed is critical to making the packing perform to it maximum efficiency. Methods of evaluating the effectiveness of a liquid distributor to evenly distribute the liquid entering a packed bed can be found in references. Considerable work as been done on this topic by Fractionation Research, Inc. (commonly known as FRI).|$|E
25|$|Hypothyroidism is {{the most}} common {{endocrine}} disease in dogs. It can be caused by autoimmune destruction (lymphocytic thyroiditis) or idiopathic atrophy of the thyroid gland. These two causes are responsible for over 95% of the hypothyroidism cases in dogs. Signs include decreased appetite, weight gain, hair loss, dry skin/coat, skin that is cold to the touch, recurring skin infections, and lethargy. The dog may also seek out warm places to lie. The symptoms of hypothyroidism are shared with many other medical conditions; {{it may not be the}} first thought when a diagnosis is made. Symptoms may not appear until 75% or more of the gland is non-functional. In less than 10% of hypothyroidism cases, <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> with the thyroid gland itself, but with the pituitary gland in the brain. The pituitary gland produces a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH); without this hormone to signal the thyroid gland to produce its thyroid hormone, the thyroid gland remains inactive. Treatment is with oral thyroid hormone supplementation. Lack of enough iodine in the diet can produce a form of hypothyroidism; without the proper amount of it, the thyroid gland fails to produce enough thyroid hormone. Myxedema coma is a rare but serious aspect of the disease that is a medical emergency.|$|E

500|$|Several gaming and {{technology}} sites reported an [...] "overheating bug" [...] with StarCraft II {{that in some}} cases resulted in permanent damage to video cards. The source of the problem {{is the fact that the}} frame rate is not locked on menu screens. This causes the graphics card to continuously render the image, resulting in excessive heat. Blizzard has acknowledged the problem, and posted a temporary workaround. [...] They also recommended ensuring computer systems are well ventilated and contacting the videocard manufacturer for hardware-related issues. In response to the reports, Blizzard's Public Relations Manager, Bob Colayco said: [...] "There is no code in our software that will cause video cards to overheat. When we saw this issue first reported, we conducted thorough additional testing and determined that for those players experiencing this problem, the cause is most likely hardware-related." [...] CrunchGear has also suggested that <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> with StarCraft II, but rather due to poorly maintained hardware and inadequate cooling. They do however agree that the overheating only occurs on non-framerate locked screens and provide the fix that Blizzard has offered to users. [...] Other articles recommend that users regularly clean the dust out of their computer to improve the cooling efficiency of their systems. Blizzard posted a message on their forums regarding the issue that has since been removed. The message was: [...] "Screens that are light on detail may make your system overheat if cooling is overall insufficient. This is because the game has nothing to do so it is primarily just working on drawing the screen very quickly." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Field, it is {{impossible}} to decide which of these two affirmations is true. Prior to the theory of relativity, the term [...] "mass" [...] was referentially indeterminate.

The reference of such terms as mass is only partially determined: we don't really know how Newton intended his use of this term to be applied. As a consequence, neither of the two terms fully denotes (refers). It follows that it is improper to maintain that a term has changed its reference during a scientific revolution; it is more appropriate to describe terms such as [...] "mass" [...] as [...] "having undergone a denotional refinement." ...|$|E

Robert H.

Tipler in extending Hart's arguments.|$|E

According to Miguel Angel Santos, a researcher at the Kennedy School of Government of Harvard University, as a result of expropriations of private means of production since 2004, [...] "production was destroyed", while a [...] "wave of consumption based on imports" [...] occurred when Venezuela had abundant oil money. With poor production and a dependence on imports, the drop of oil prices beginning in 2014 made it impossible for the Bolivarian government to import necessary goods for all Venezuelans.|$|E
