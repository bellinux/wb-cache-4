5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was {{half the size}} of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who'd heard her speak.|$|E

25|$|Although an American citizen {{for many}} years, Joe McManus {{continued}} {{to visit his}} Canadian friends and attend many Canadian meetings {{in spite of the}} numerous demanding professional and scientific positions which he held for more than 3 decades. His continuing interest in Canada and his support and friendliness towards our scientists at meetings is a good reason for Canadians to remember him. To <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who met him later in his career it was apparent that he showed the fearlessness of a fighter, regardless of the odds against him whenever it seemed important to state his opinion on controversial scientific, professional or political problems. As a distinguished alumnus he was constantly in touch with Queens University and participated in the scientific program held during the 100th anniversary of the Queen's University Medical School.|$|E

James Berardinelli from ReelViews praised the film saying, [...] "With each new animated release, Disney seems to be expanding its already-broad horizons a little more. The Lion King is the most mature (in more than one sense) of these films, and there clearly has been a conscious effort to please adults as much as children. Happily, for <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who generally stay far away from 'cartoons', they have succeeded." ...|$|E

ABC's Ted Koppel reflected on the media's role in the tragedy on Nightline: [...] "We need to begin by acknowledging our own contribution...We feed one another: those of you looking for publicity and <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> looking for stories."

If you’re a diehard MercyMe fan, this disc will be music to your ears. But for <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who long for change (Not drastic ones, mind you.

[...] On the subject, Rice herself commented, [...] "From the beginning, I've had gay fans, and gay readers who felt that my works involved a sustained gay allegory ...

So even when Christopher was a little baby, I had gay readers and gay friends and knew gay people, and lived in the Castro district of San Francisco, which was a gay neighborhood." ...|$|E
