40|$|International audienceIn most Gram-positive bacteria, catabolite {{repression}} is mediated by a bifunctional enzyme, the histidine-containing protein kinase/phosphatase (HprK/P). Based either on its primary sequence or on its recently solved three-dimensional structure, no straightforward homology with other known proteins was found. However, we showed here that HprK/P exhibits a restricted homology with an unrelated phosphotransferase, the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. <b>This</b> <b>includes</b> <b>notably</b> two consecutive Asp residues from the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase active site, whose equivalent residues were mutated in Bacillus subtilis HprK/P. Characterization of the corresponding mutants emphasizes {{the crucial role}} of these Asp residues in the HprK/P functioning. Furthermore, superimposition of HprK/P and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase active sites supports the view that both enzymes bear significant resemblance in their overall mechanism of functioning showing that these two enzymes constitute a new family of phosphotransferases.

40|$|Abstract. Multi-view {{modeling}} {{refers to}} a system designer constructing distinct and separate models of the same system to model different (se-mantic) aspects of a system. Modeling pragmatics also entails construct-ing different views of a system, but here the focus is on syntactic/prag-matic aspects, with an emphasis on designer productivity, and the views are constructed automatically by filtering and drawing algorithms. In this paper, we argue that both approaches will have growing influence on model-based design, in particular for complex cyber-physical systems, and we identify a number of general developments that seem likely to contribute to this until 2020. <b>This</b> <b>includes</b> <b>notably</b> the trend towards domain-specific modeling and agile development, novel input devices, and the move to the cloud. We also report on preliminary practical results in this area with two modeling environments, Ptolemy and KIELER, and the lessons learned from their combined usage. ...|$|E

40|$|The fifth EU {{enlargement}} in 2004 and 2007 enlarged {{not only}} the internal European market. In 2008, the euro zone will compass 15 out of 27 EU member countries, and the Schengen area is being expanded to include 22 member countries. The new member countries have already been able to benefit noticeably from {{their participation in the}} internal market, despite not yet fully integrated labour markets. The majority of the new member countries have grown faster than previously and have substantially increased their trade with the old member countries. As expected, the new member countries have benefited much more clearly from the most recent enlargement than the old member countries. Nevertheless, many problems remain yet to be solved: the income gap needs to be closed, the competitive position of the new member countries needs to be reinforced, and their economies need to be stabilised macroeconomically. <b>This</b> <b>includes</b> <b>notably</b> the reduction of the high current account deficits, a curbing of inflation, and in some cases a budget stabilisation.

40|$|The European Water Framework Directive {{requires}} the monitoring of priority pollutants entering surface waters. <b>This</b> <b>includes</b> <b>notably</b> the stormwater network. In this study, {{the contribution of}} discharges from wash stations to pollution of the stormwater network was investigated. Six wash stations discharging wastewater into the stormwater network were selected: (i) one trucks wash station, (ii) two self-service stations for cars and motorcycles, (iii) two bus wash stations, (iv) one subway wash station. Classical parameters (conductivity, pH, turbidity, chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, suspended solid) and organic micropollutants (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), Total Hydrocarbons (TH) and Methylterbutylether (MTBE)) were checked and measured. Concentrations were compared with limit values from Greater Toulouse decontamination service regulations for the discharge licenses of carwashes, and under the French decree for discharges into the natural environment and with the proposed directive from the European Parliament and the Council, dealing with environmental quality standards. The result showed a decrease of pollution downstream of the pre-treatments for subway wash stations but not for bus wash stations. According to the directives, the pre-treatment processes are not sufficient to justify a discharge into the stormwater network...|$|E
