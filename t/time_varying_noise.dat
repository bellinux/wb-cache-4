40|$|The Power Line Channel (PLC) is a {{very harsh}} {{transmission}} medium because of its frequency selective and time-varying transfer function that exhibits several notches in the band of interest.

This paper discusses results of flyover noise measurements of four small UAVs, including an internal combustion-powered model airplane and three battery-powered multicopters. Basic noise characteristics of these vehicles are discussed, including spectral properties and sound level metrics such as sound pressure level, effective perceived noise level, and sound exposure level. The size and aerodynamic characteristics of the multicopters in particular make their flight path susceptible to atmospheric disturbances such as wind gusts. These gusts, coupled with a flight control system that varies rotor speed to maintain vehicle stability, create an unsteady acoustic signature. The spectral variations resulting from this unsteadiness are explored, in both hover and flyover conditions for the multicopters.

A novel feature extraction process suitable for suppression of <b>time</b> <b>varying</b> <b>noise</b> is compared with a fine-tuned spectral subtraction noise suppression front-end. Both techniques are employed to derive enhanced Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) for a textindependent speaker verification baseline system which has participated in the 2002 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation. The novel feature extraction technique is based on approximating the clean speech spectral magnitude as well as noise spectral magnitude {{with a mixture of}} Gaussian pdfs using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm (EM). Subsequently the Bayesian inference framework is applied to the degraded spectral coefficients and by employing Minimum Mean Square Error Estimation (MMSE), a closed form solution for the spectral magnitude estimation task is derived. The estimated spectral magnitude is finally incorporated in the MFCC framework. A comparative study of the proposed technique in a variety of real-world noise types demonstrates a significant performance gain compared to the baseline speech features, and to spectral subtraction enhancement method.

40|$|We {{revisit the}} Bayesian online {{inference}} {{problems for the}} linear dynamic systems (LDS) under non- Gaussian environment. The noises can naturally be non-Gaussian (skewed and/or heavy tailed) or to accommodate spurious observations, noises can be modeled as heavy tailed. However, {{at the cost of}} such noise robustness, the performance may degrade when such spurious observations are absent. Therefore, any inference engine should not only be robust to noise outlier, but also be adaptive to potentially unknown and <b>time</b> <b>varying</b> <b>noise</b> parameters; yet it should be scalable and easy to implement. To address them, we envisage here a new noise adaptive Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF), by leveraging a hierarchically Gaussian model as a proxy for any non-Gaussian (process or measurement) noise density. This leads to a conditionally linear Gaussian model (CLGM), that is tractable. However, this framework requires a valid transition kernel for the intractable state, targeted by the particle filter (PF). This is typically unknown. We outline how such kernel can be constructed provably, at least for certain classes encompassing many commonly occurring non-Gaussian noises, using auxiliary latent variable approach.

40|$|AbstractThe {{simplest}} {{and very}} familiar method {{to take out}} stationary background noise is spectral subtraction. In this algorithm, a spectral noise bias is calculated from segments of speech inactivity and is subtracted from noisy speech spectral amplitude, retaining the phase as it is. Secondary procedures follow spectral subtraction to reduce the unpleasant auditory effects due to spectral error. The drawback of spectral subtraction {{is that it is}} applicable to speech corrupted by stationary noise. The research in this topic aims at studying the spectral subtraction & Wiener filter technique when the speech is degraded by non-stationary noise. We have studied both algorithms assuming stationary noise scenario. In this we want to study these two algorithms in the context of non-stationary noise. Next, decision directed (DD) approach, is used to estimate the <b>time</b> <b>varying</b> <b>noise</b> spectrum which resulted in better performance in terms of intelligibility and reduced musical noise. However, the a priori SNR estimator of the current frame relies on the estimated speech spectrum from the earlier frame. The undesirable consequence is that the gain function doesn’t match the current frame, resulting in a bias which causes annoying echoing effect. A method called Two-step noise reduction (TSNR) algorithm was used to solve the problem which tracks instantaneously the non-stationarity of the signal but, not by losing the advantage of the DD approach. The a priori SNR estimation was modified and made better by an additional step for removing the bias, thus eliminating reverberation effect. The output obtained even with TSNR still suffers from harmonic distortions which are inherent to all short time noise suppression techniques, the main reason being the inaccuracy in estimating PSD in single channel systems. To outdo this problem, a concept called, Harmonic Regeneration Noise Reduction (HRNR) is used wherein a non-linearity is made use of for regenerating the distorted/missing harmonics. All the above discussed algorithms have been implemented and their performance evaluated using both subjective and objective criteria. The performance is significantly improved by using HRNR combined with TSNR, as compared to TSNR, DD alone, as HRNR ensures restoration of harmonics. The spectral subtraction performance stands much below the above discussed methods for obvious reasons...|$|E

40|$|The {{portability}} {{of modern}} voice processing devices {{allows them to}} be used in environments where background noise conditions can be adverse. Background noise can deteriorate the quality of speech transmitted through such devices, but speech enhancement algorithms can ameliorate this degradation to some extent. The development of speech enhancement algorithms that improve the quality of noisy speech is the aim of this thesis, which consists of three main parts. In the first part, we propose a framework of algorithms that estimate the clean speech Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) coefficients. The algorithms are derived from the Bayesian theory of estimation and can be grouped according to i) the STFT representation they estimate ii) the estimator they apply and iii) the speech prior density they assume. Apart from the introduction of algorithms that surpass the performance of similar algorithms that exist in the literature, the compilation of the above framework offers insight on the effect and relative importance of the different components of the algorithms (e. g. prior, estimator) {{to the quality of the}} enhanced speech. In the second part of this thesis, we develop methods for the estimation of the power of <b>time</b> <b>varying</b> <b>noise.</b> The main outcome is a method that exploits some similarities between the distribution of the noisy speech spectral amplitude coefficients within a single frequency bin, and the corresponding distribution of the corrupting noise. The above similarities allow the extraction of samples that are more likely to correspond to noise, from a window of past spectral amplitude observations. The extracted samples are then used to produce an estimate of the noise power. In the final part of this thesis, we are concerned with the incorporation of the time and frequency dependencies of speech signals in our estimation model. The theoretical framework on which the modelling is based is provided by Markov Random Fields (MRF’s). Initially, we develop a MAP estimator of speech based on the Gaussian MRF prior. In the following, we introduce the Chi MRF, which is employed in the development of an improved speech estimator.

In Chapter 3 phase noise estimation in single-input single-output (SISO) systems is investigated. First, a hard decision directed extended Kalman filter (EKF) is applied to an uncoded system. Next, an iterative receiver algorithm performing code-aided turbo synchronization is derived using the expectation maximization (EM) framework for a coded system. Two soft-decision directed estimators in the literature based on Kalman filtering are evaluated. Low density parity check (LDPC) codes are proposed to calculate marginal a posteriori probabilities and to construct soft decision symbols. Error rate performance of both estimators are compared through simulations. In Chapter 4 phase noise estimation in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems is investigated.

Simulated case studies on a second-order system and a cart-pole system show that both the Radial Basis Function (RBF) controller and the GP controller find good solutions when the number of basis functions is chosen correctly. However, when a high number of basis functions is selected, the RBF controller fails completely, while the GP controller is able find a suboptimal solution. In order to reduce the computational time for large systems is the identification of the GP model parallelized. For a four dimensional model the parallelization results in a 20 to 40 percent reduction of the identification computational time. A simulated case study of a cart-pole system shows a strong decrease in performance when increasing the measurement noise variance or kurtosis. The controller is robust for changing skewness of the measurement noise. Furthermore is the variance of the measurement noise an important parameter, because it has to be selected as a fixed parameter of the GP controller prior to learning. Therefore Adaptive-Probabilistic Inference for Learning COntrol (A-PILCO) is proposed. This is a framework that initiates a new learning process when the measurement noise variance exceeds its confidence bounds. By reducing the computational time significantly for large and/or complex systems and by implementing the A-PILCO framework the PILCO algorithm becomes applicable larger set of systems.

We also study the role of threshold fluctuations in the failure of front propagation, both in the fast and slow <b>varying</b> <b>noise</b> limits. ...|$|R
30|$|The second dataset was {{obtained}} with a TSE-FLAIR volumetric sequence (256 × 256 × 160 voxels with a voxels resolution of 0.94 × 0.94 × 1 mm 3) acquired on a Philips Gyroscan 3 Tesla scanner (Best, Netherlands) using a sensitivity encoding (SENSE) acceleration factor of 2, TR = 14 ms, and TE = 140 ms. Although parallel acquisition {{techniques such as}} SENSE or generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions introduce a spatially <b>varying</b> <b>noise</b> variance across the image, we used this dataset here to show the capability of the proposed approach on MR images with spatially <b>varying</b> <b>noise.</b>|$|R
40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: To {{adapt the}} {{so-called}} nonlocal means filter {{to deal with}} magnetic resonance (MR) images with spatially <b>varying</b> <b>noise</b> levels (for both Gaussian and Rician distributed noise). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Most filtering techniques assume an equal noise distribution across the image. When this assumption is not met, the resulting filtering becomes suboptimal. This {{is the case of}} MR images with spatially <b>varying</b> <b>noise</b> levels, such as those obtained by parallel imaging (sensitivity-encoded), intensity inhomogeneity-corrected images, or surface coil-based acquisitions. We propose a new method where information regarding the local image noise level is used to adjust the amount of denoising strength of the filter. Such information is automatically obtained from the images using a new local noise estimation method. RESULTS: The proposed method was validated and compared with the standard nonlocal means filter on simulated and real MRI data showing an improved performance in all cases. CONCLUSION: The new noise-adaptive method was demonstrated to outperform the standard filter when spatially <b>varying</b> <b>noise</b> is present in the images...|$|R
