5|$|About 40 {{years after}} the Persian conquest of Ionia, and in {{the reign of the}} fourth Persian king, Darius the Great, the {{stand-in}} Milesian tyrant Aristagoras found himself in this familiar predicament. In 500 BC, Aristagoras was approached by some exiles from Naxos, who asked him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island. Seeing an opportunity to strengthen his position in Miletus by conquering Naxos, Aristagoras approached the satrap of Lydia, Artaphernes, proposing a joint attack on Naxos, to which Artaphernes assented.|$|E
5|$|Brugge {{started the}} match {{the better of}} the two sides and {{took the lead in}} the 5th minute.

5|$|Constance of Hauteville (1128–1163) was {{the ruling}} Princess of Antioch from 1130 to 1163. She {{was the only}} child of Bohemond II of Antioch by his wife, Alice of Jerusalem. Constance succeeded her father, who fell in battle, at the age of two, {{although}} his cousin, Roger II of Sicily, laid claim to Antioch. Her mother assumed the regency, but the Antiochene noblemen replaced her with her father (Constance's grandfather), Baldwin II of Jerusalem. After he died in 1131, Alice again tried <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government, but the Antiochene barons acknowledged the right of her brother-in-law, Fulk of Anjou, to rule as regent for Constance.|$|E

5|$|Cyberpunk is {{the fifth}} studio album by English rock vocalist Billy Idol. A concept album, it was {{released}} in 1993 by Chrysalis Records. Inspired by his personal interest in technology and his first attempts to use computers {{in the creation of}} his music, Idol based the album on the cyberdelic subculture of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Heavily experimental in its style, the album was an attempt by Idol <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creative process in the production of his albums, while simultaneously introducing Idol's fans and other musicians to the opportunities presented by digital media.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, with Drumlin {{seeking to}} close SETI, Arroway discovers a signal repeating a {{sequence}} of prime numbers, apparently sent from the star system Vega some 26 light-years away. This announcement causes Drumlin and the National Security Council led by Michael Kitz to attempt <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> facility. Arroway's team then discover a video buried in the signal: Adolf Hitler's opening address at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Arroway and her team postulate that {{this would have been}} the first television signal strong enough to leave Earth's atmosphere, taking 26 years to reach Vega and then being transmitted back from there.|$|E

After she had come free, Agamemnon landed guns and shot in Kjörge Bay to form part of a battery being {{established}} there to command the city. Firing commenced on 2 September, and lasted until the Danes surrendered on 7 September. In November, Agamemnon joined the blockading squadron off Lisbon.|$|E

5|$|In {{the middle}} of May, the {{situation}} for the 50,000 Arab inhabitants {{of the city and}} the 30,000–40,000 in the outlying neighbourhoods was no better. After the massacre at Deir Yassin and the Jewish offensive of April that triggered the large-scale exodus of the Palestinian Arabs in other mixed cities, the Arab population of Jerusalem was frightened and feared for its fate. With the departure of the British on 14 May, the Haganah launched several operations <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city and the local Arab leadership requested King Abdullah of Jordan to deploy his army to come to their aid.|$|E

Hákon subsequently bestowed the title upon Eóghan, and in 1249, upon learning of Haraldr Óláfsson's death, Hákon sent Eóghan westward <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hebrides. In May 1249, Haraldr Óláfsson's brother, Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson (died 1249), formally succeeded to the kingship.|$|E

5|$|Ironically, the treason and {{defection}} of Dumouriez {{gave the}} Jacobins full scope <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> armies. Before Neerwinden, the army obeyed its commanders. Afterward, the representatives on mission were given extraordinary powers over army commanders. The generals might pay {{with their lives}} for defeat, but the real authority lay with the political operatives. Meanwhile, the new War Minister sent his agents to spy on the generals. These men were quick to report any complaint against officers, which could result in disgrace or execution. Elements of this system stayed in force even after Maximilien Robespierre was overthrown and guillotined.|$|E
5|$|Korçë {{belongs to}} the region {{regarded}} as Northern Epirus, a region with substantial Albanian, Aromanian and Greek populations. The Greek national view was to classify all Aromanians and Orthodox Albanians {{as part of the}} Greek minority. The Great Powers signed the Protocol of Florence and awarded the region to the newly founded Principality of Albania on December 17, 1913. Gradual withdrawal of the Greek army would enable the Albanian forces <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region. Consequently, to avert this possibility, pro-Greek Epirotes decided to declare their own separate political identity and self-governance.|$|E
