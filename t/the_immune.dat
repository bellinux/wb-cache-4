5|$|Clearly, some tumors evade <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> {{system and}} go on to become cancers. Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I {{molecules}} on their surface, thus avoiding detection by killer T cells. Some tumor cells also release products that inhibit <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> response; for example by secreting the cytokine TGF-Î², which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes. In addition, immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens, so <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> system no longer attacks the tumor cells.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> {{adaptive}} <b>immune</b> system, {{also known}} as <b>the</b> acquired <b>immune</b> system or, more rarely, as <b>the</b> specific <b>immune</b> system, is a subsystem of <b>the</b> overall <b>immune</b> system that is composed of highly specialized, systemic cells and processes that eliminate pathogens or prevent their growth. <b>The</b> adaptive <b>immune</b> system {{is one of the}} two main immunity strategies found in vertebrates (the other being <b>the</b> innate <b>immune</b> system). Adaptive immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, and leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination. Like the innate system, the adaptive system includes both humoral immunity components and cell-mediated immunity components.|$|R

One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.|$|E

5|$|Disorders of <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> {{system can}} result in {{autoimmune}} diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer.

In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} design and {{application}} of artificial immune systems (AISs), problem-solving systems inspired by the human and other immune systems.

This thesis presents and discusses a number of design principles for AISs which are modelled on both innate and adaptive immunity.

5|$|Long-term active {{memory is}} {{acquired}} following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity {{can also be}} generated artificially, through vaccination.

This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> system, {{as well as its}} inducibility.
