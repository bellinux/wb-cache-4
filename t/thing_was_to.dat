Although the mainland Chinese were invited by the Munich Olympic organizers to send an observer delegation to Munich (they declined due to the Taiwanese presence), {{it was not until}} 1975, after Brundage's departure as president, that the PRC applied to rejoin the Olympic movement. The PRC again participated at the 1980 Winter Games at Lake Placid and then the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles; the island NOC competed as the Republic of China in 1968 and 1972; when refused permission to compete under that name in 1976, after Brundage's death, it boycotted the 1976 and 1980 games, returning in 1984 as Chinese Taipei.|$|E
25|$|When I {{first started}} doing the stain paintings, I left {{large areas of}} canvas unpainted, I think, because the canvas itself acted as forcefully and as {{positively}} as paint or line or color. In other words, the very ground {{was part of the}} medium, so that instead of thinking of it as background or negative space or an empty spot, that area did not need paint because it had paint next to it. The <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> decide where to leave it and where to fill it and where to say this doesn't need another line or another pail of colors. It's saying it in space.|$|E
500|$|William J. Bell created Victor as a {{short-term}} non-contractual role, debuting on February 8, 1980. Bell stated in 1997, [...] " [...] would last between eight to twelve weeks, {{at which time}} {{he was to be}} shot by his wife." [...] However, once he saw Braeden's performance, he thought [...] "the voice, the power, the inner strength", and knew he didn't want to lose the actor; [...] "The first <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> get Eric under contract, but he didn't want to go under contract", he said. However, Braeden was uneasy about the daytime soap opera genre, admitting years later he thought it was [...] "too confining"; although soon signed a six-month contract.

500|$|Coppola {{wanted a}} minimalist {{look for the}} film, {{especially}} after the mixed reactions to her richly costumed Marie Antoinette. The overall effect was to be [...] "sweet and genuine but without being sappy." [...] For the visual style she discussed Bruce Weber's Hollywood portraits and Helmut Newton's photographs of models at the Chateau Marmont, and Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975), a film by Chantal Akerman about the routine of a Belgian housewife, with Harris Savides, the cinematographer. He said, [...] "The main <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> tell the story really simply and let it play out in long beats and have the audience discover the moment." [...] Coppola used the lenses {{that her father had}} used to film Rumble Fish (1983) in an effort to give the film a more period look, although it is set in the present.|$|E

By December 27, 2010, Owumi had signed a lucrative deal with Al-Nasr, a team from Benghazi that played in the top Libyan league, and was arriving in the country. Despite fears of the country's instability {{in the midst of}} the budding Arab Spring and discouragement from his girlfriend Alexis Jones, he chose to remain with the team, prompted by the poor conditions in Macedonia. He later said, [...] "The most important <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> get out of the bad situation I was in, and once I had the opportunity to get some place better to play basketball, that's all I really cared about.

Leterrier had also intended for a scene in the credits showing Blonsky, human once more, imprisoned and chained in a box. The character of Samuel Sterns, played by Tim Blake Nelson, was introduced to set him up as a villain in a possible future film, where he would become the Leader.

500|$|In a 2002 interview, Ridley Scott {{stated that}} a new Alien project [...] "would {{be a lot of}} fun", but that [...] "the most {{important}} <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> get the story right". Scott's concept for the plot was [...] "to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created", which became the basis of his prequel series. In late 2008, Weaver hinted in an interview with MTV that she and Scott were working on an Alien spinoff film, which would focus on the chronicles of Ellen Ripley rather than on the Aliens, but the continuation of Ripley's story has not materialized. Instead, Scott worked on a prequel that explained the [...] "Space Jockey" [...] found on the derelict spacecraft from Alien, titled Prometheus, which was released in June 8, 2012. Scott and Damon Lindelof developed a story that precedes the story of Alien but is not directly connected to that franchise. According to Scott, although the film shares [...] "strands of Alien's DNA so to speak", and takes place in the same universe, Prometheus explores its own mythology and ideas. A sequel to Prometheus, titled , was released in May 19, 2017.|$|E

And he said that {{if he was going to}} be involved, he wanted me to be involved, too." [...] In September 2014, Lennertz officially signed on to compose for the series. Lennertz combined all the different style elements of the show in the music, such as mixing jazz and period elements, with orchestra and electronic elements. Lennertz said, the music is [...] "always done from a sense of being sort of in control and savvy and clever, rather than just being strong or just having a superpower or sort of being so much further along than anybody else physically. Part of it was just trying to make it that she's just smarter than everybody else. She's got such command over so many of these situations, and that was the most important <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> give her that personality."

500|$|In Europe in the 1990s, a {{successful}} driver would usually progress from Formula Three either directly to Formula One, {{the pinnacle of}} the sport, or to the International Formula 3000 championship. However, Hill {{did not have enough}} sponsorship available to fund a drive in F3000. He says [...] "I ended up having to reappraise my career a bit. The first <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> realise how lucky I was to be driving anything. I made the decision that whatever I drove I would do it {{to the best of my}} ability and see where it led." [...] He took a one-off drive in the lower level British F3000 championship and shared a Porsche 962 at Le Mans for Richard Lloyd Racing, where the engine failed after 228laps. He also competed in one race in the British Touring Car Championship at Donington Park, driving a Ford Sierra RS500. Midway through the season, an opportunity arose at the uncompetitive Mooncraft F3000 team. The team tested Hill and Perry McCarthy. Their performances were comparable but according to the team manager, John Wickham, the team sponsors preferred the Hill name. Although his best result was a 15th place, Hill's race performances for Mooncraft led to an offer to drive a Lola chassis for Middlebridge Racing in 1990. He took three pole positions and led five races in 1990, but did not win a race during his Formula 3000 career.|$|E

2500|$|Snap-dragon (also {{known as}} Flap-dragon, Snapdragon, or Flapdragon) was a parlour game popular from about the 16th century. It was played during the winter, {{particularly}} on Christmas Eve. Brandy was heated {{and placed in}} a wide shallow bowl; raisins were placed in the brandy which was then set alight. Typically, lights were extinguished or dimmed to increase the eerie effect of the blue flames playing across the liquor. The aim of the game was to pluck the raisins out of the burning brandy and eat them, at the risk of being burnt. Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language (1755) describes it as [...] "a play in which they catch raisins out of burning brandy and, extinguishing them by closing the mouth, eat them". According to an eighteenth-century article in Richard Steele's Tatler magazine, [...] "the wantonness of the <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> see each other look like a demon, as we burnt ourselves, and snatched out the fruit." [...] Snap-dragon was played in England, Canada, and the United States, but there is insufficient evidence of the practice in Scotland, or other countries.|$|E
