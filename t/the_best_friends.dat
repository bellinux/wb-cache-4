25|$|Winfrey and Gayle King are friends. In 1976, Winfrey {{was working}} as a news anchor in Baltimore when she met King, a {{production}} assistant. The two bonded during a snowstorm when Winfrey told King she could stay at her home to wait it out. Their friendship was often showcased on the show when <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>friends</b> decided to take a trip together.|$|E
25|$|For the {{farewell}} season, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>friends</b> hit {{the road}} again for an overnight camping trip at Yosemite National Park. Park ranger Shelton Johnson wrote to Winfrey because he was concerned by the low number of African-Americans who visited the national parks each year. So Winfrey and King packed up their camper and headed to Yosemite to help Johnson attract visitors. When they arrived, Johnson took Winfrey and King around the park {{to see some of}} its famous sites including Mariposa Grove and the Tunnel View, where El Capitan is visible in the distance. On the way to the campsite, Winfrey made a sharp turn causing their trailer to hit a rock. After setting up their pop-up camper, the two mixed up some Moscow Mules to pass out to their camping neighbors. The drink has become a signature Oprah cocktail. The next day they took a lesson in fly fishing and wrapped up their stay with a mule ride.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that people compare themselves with routine standards—such as their best friend—during self–evaluations (Mussweiler & Rüter, 2003). In these past studies, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> was more accessible than a former friend subsequent to self–evaluations. We therefore con-cluded that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> {{was used as a}} routine standard. However, spreading activation from the self to the more closely associated <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> would provide an alternative explanation. In the present research, we want to rule out this possibility and demonstrate that comparison processes are responsible for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend’s</b> increased accessibility. In Study 1, we con-trasted comparative self–evaluations with absolute ones. In Study 2, partic-ipants engaged either in comparative self–evaluations or in self–descriptions. Afterwards the accessibility (Study 1) or the facilitation of judgments (Study 2) of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> was assessed. Both studies support the assumption that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> was used as a routine standard during comparative self–evaluations...|$|R

500|$|In 1999, Cox was {{nominated}} for an American Comedy Award for Funniest Supporting Female Performer in a TV Series.
