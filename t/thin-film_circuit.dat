40|$|Last year, {{advances}} in organic device technology (such as device scaling, high K-dielectrics [1], [...] .) enabled a substantial progress in performance. This {{resulted in an}} increase in the data rate of plastic transponder circuits from about 2 kbit/s [21 to EPC-compatible speeds (SO kbit/s). The organic semiconductor pentacene deposited from solution was replaced by a better-performing vapor-phase deposited pentacene, with a mobility being a factor of 3 higher. The isolation of pentacene transistors in this new process is achieved by an integrated shadow mask, shown in Fig. 1, that results in a reliable isolation of the semiconductor area testified by off-currents below 10 pA. We replaced the organic polymer (low-k) dielectric with a 100 -nm thick high-k dielectric, sputtered AIz 03, resulting in an 8 -fold higher specific accumulation capacitance. That, in turn, allowed for downscaling the transistor channel length from 51 lm to 211 m, while maintaining a high output resistance in saturation - and therefore also high inverter gain and noise margins. A cross-section of this process flow is depicted in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows a micrograph image of a 5 -stage ring oscillator realized in this technology on foil optimized for speed. This organic <b>thin-film</b> <b>circuit</b> technology allows to design with lower overlap capacitance and to downscale the transistor channel length, within the boundaries achievable by existing high-throughput manufacturing tools (e. g. steppers used in backplane manufacturing). In this work, we varied the channel lengths (L) of the TFTs in the circuits between 20 μm and 2 μm and limited the gate-source and gate-drain overlap capacitances by decreasing the width of the finger-shaped source and drain contacts, that fully overlap the gate, from 5 μm to 2 μm. Fig. 2 shows a micrograph image of one transistor. Typical transfer curves of transistors fabricated in this technology, having L = 5 μm and 2 μm, are depicted in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 respectively. The transistors are normally-on and their charge carrier (hole) mobility exceeds 0. 5 cm 2 /Vs. Fig. 5 shows typical transfer curves of a zerovgs-load inverters with channel lengths of 5 μm and 2 μm. The ratio between drive and load transistor is 10 : 1. The inverters have high gains and noise margins. The stage delay (τ D) of inverters in this technology is plotted {{as a function of the}} supply voltage in Fig. 6. The stage delay is determined from 19 -stage ring oscillators. The figure shows τ D for inverters with channel lengths from 20 μm to 2 μm and gate-overlap of the transistor-fingers ranging from 5 μm to 2 μm. Stage delays below 1 μS, and as low as 400 ns, are shown at V DD = 10 V. To our knowledge, no plastic technology was shown before with such speeds at these low power voltages. The effect of decreasing the overlap capacitance is also shown for the two smaller channel lengths: shrinking the overlap from 5 μm to 2 μm improves the stage delay by a factor of 1. 5 to 2. We proceeded with the design and realization of 8 bit organic RFID transponder chips, having a channel length of 2 μm and either 5 μm or 2 μm finger widths. Figs. 7 and 8 show the photographs of the 6 ″ wafer and a zoom of the die, Fig. 9 shows the corresponding schematic. Fig. 11 depicts the output signal of both types of transponders. In agreement with the two-fold faster inverter stage delay for the 2 μm fingers, the data rate of this transponder is also twice as high as that of the design with 5 μm fingers. The obtained data rate of the 8 bit transponder with channel length and fingers of 2 μm is a record 50 kb/s. © 2010 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{nanotube}} (CNT) -based sensors {{for structural}} health monitoring (SHM) can be embedded in structures of all geometries to monitor conditions {{both inside and}} at {{the surface of the}} structure to continuously sense changes. These CNTs can be manipulated into specific orientations to create small, powerful, and flexible sensors. One of the sensors is a highly flexible sensor for crack growth detection and strain field mapping that features a very dense and highly ordered array of single-walled CNTs. CNT structural health sensors can be mass-produced, are inexpensive, can be packaged in small sizes (0. 5 micron(sup 2)), require less power than electronic or piezoelectric transducers, and produce less waste heat per square centimeter than electronic or piezoelectric transducers. Chemically functionalized lithographic patterns are used to deposit and align the CNTs onto metallic electrodes. This method consistently produces aligned CNTs in the defined locations.

40|$|Since the {{inception}} of microelectronics {{only a few years}} ago, a number of techniques have been devised to solve some of the problems associated with the new concepts. The use of electron and ion-beam machines have led to some of the more important developments and the present trend indicates that these machines will shortly be standard equipment in the fabrication and study of microelectronic circuits. This dissertation describes a microelectronic research facility, which integrates many of the processes required in the fabrication of microelectronic circuits and will, thereby, alleviate some of the basic difficulties arising from the small size of the circuit elements. The machine has been called the "Multipurpose Microelectronic Processor", which was abbreviated to MMP. The design of the MMP and the theory on which it is based have been fully discussed. The MMP was designed primarily for basic research in microelectronics involving thin films but it will also permit the fabrication of microelectronic circuits and will facilitate research in related fields. When completed, the MMP will permit controlled deposition of thin films from an ion beam, electron-beam micromachining, topological inspection using a scanning electron microscope, and chemical analysis using a microanalyser. These processes will be achieved without the need of moving the substrate from one work station to another with the associated problems of reregistration and maintaining clean surfaces. The vacuum system for the MMP has been completed and the scanning electron microscope is in operation. Some modifications to the main electron gun will be necessary to increase the resolution of the scanning electron microscope and to increase the beam power for the machining mode of the MMP.

40|$|The large-area, roll-to-roll (R 2 R) {{fabrication}} of organic <b>thin-film</b> <b>circuits</b> on plastic foils demands low-cost manufacturing and {{the integration of}} devices onto flexible plastic substrates. We have developed a fully dry process [1] to fabricate low-voltage organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) with 10 -nm thick dielectric amenable to R 2 R processing. Two commercially available polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) plastic foils (DuPont Teijin [2]) were compared for use as possible flexible substrates. Teonex Q 65 FA features an adhesive layer on the bottom side to prevent its slippage during the R 2 R process, while Optfine PQA 1 includes a planarisation layer on the top (device) side. The PEN films were pre-annealed at 160 °C for 24 hours prior to OTFT fabrication. 160 °C is the maximum temperature used in our OTFT fabrication process and the pre-annealing should mitigate the layer-to-layer misalignment during the OTFT fabrication. Teonex Q 65 FA remained flat after the pre-annealing step, while the radius of curvature of Optfine PQA 1 changed from  17 cm to 1. 5 cm after the anneal. Consequently, we fabricated Al/AlOx/C 8 PA/DNTT/Au and Al/AlOx/DNTT/Au OTFTs on non-annealed Optfine and pre-annealed Teonex foils. Dinaphthothienothiophene (DNTT) was chosen due to its excellent air-stability {{and the addition of}} n-octylphosphonic acid (C 8 PA) improves its growth. 15 nm of DNTT was deposited at room temperature at rates of 0. 4 Å/s and 0. 6 Å/s on the Teonex and Optfine, respectively. The initial OTFT performance was evaluated by measuring the transfer characteristics between 0 and − 2 V and extracting the field-effect mobility, threshold voltage, subthreshold slope, etc. Bias stress was performed approximately one week after the initial measurements at a gate voltage of − 2 V while the source and drain were grounded. Referring to Table 1, one week of storage in vacuum between the initial and bias stress measurements, led to a reduction in OTFT threshold voltage and an increase in the mobility and the OFF-current. Figure 1 shows the as-fabricated OTFT parameters extracted from transfer characteristics measured at a drain voltage of − 2 V. For both PEN substrates tested, the inclusion of the C 8 PA monolayer increases field-effect mobility, ON-current and ON/OFF-current ratio and reduces subthreshold slope and OFF-current. The substrates affect OTFT performance in a mixed way. Comparing OTFTs with C 8 PA monolayer Teonex PEN has a slightly lower subthreshold slope and OFF-current than the Optfine PEN film. However, the Optfine film exhibits about a factor of three higher field-effect mobility (0. 14 cm 2 /Vs) and about an order of magnitude higher ON-current. The OTFTs on Optfine PEN substrate also appear to remain more stable after the application of bias stress in terms of mobility, even though their threshold voltage {{at the beginning of the}} bias stress was  − 0. 4 V lower than that of OTFTs fabricated on Teonex PEN. In conclusion, Teonex PEN was found to be easier to handle, since it remained flat upon heating at 160 °C. However, the AlOx/C 8 PA transistors exhibited about a factor of three lower field-effect mobility when compared to Optfine PEN OTFTs. The planarisation layer on Optfine PEN leads to improved OTFT mobility compared to Teonex PEN; however the Optfine PEN curved significantly upon heating and therefore presents a significant challenge if used as a free-standing substrate with our OTFT fabrication procedure...|$|R

The bio-nanobattery under development at NASA s Langley Research Center provides new capabilities for electrical power generation, storage, and distribution {{as compared to}} conventional power storage systems. Most currently available electronic systems and devices rely on a single, centralized power source to supply electrical power to a specified location in the circuit. As electronic devices and associated components continue to shrink in size towards the nanometer-scale, a single centralized power source becomes impractical. Small systems, such as these, will require distributed power elements to reduce Joule heating, to minimize wiring quantities, and to allow autonomous operation of the various functions performed by the circuit. Our research involves the development and characterization of a bio-nanobattery using ferritins reconstituted with both an iron core (Fe-ferritin) and a cobalt core (Co-ferritin). Synthesis and characterization of the Co-ferritin and Fe-ferritin electrodes were performed, including reducing capability and the half-cell electrical potentials. Electrical output of nearly 0. 5 V for the battery cell was measured. Ferritin utilizing other metallic cores were also considered to increase the overall electrical output. Two dimensional ferritin arrays were produced on various substrates to demonstrate the feasibility of a thin-film nano-scaled power storage system for distributed power storage applications. The bio-nanobattery will be ideal for nanometerscaled electronic applications, due to the small size, high energy density, and flexible thin-film structure.

40|$|Atomic-layer-deposited SnO 2 {{is used as}} a gate {{electrode}} to replace indium tin oxide (ITO) in <b>thin-film</b> transistors and <b>circuits</b> for the first time. The SnO 2 films deposited at 200 °C show low electrical resistivity of ≈ 3. 1 × 10 − 3 Ω cm with ≈ 93 % transparency in most of the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Thin-film transistors fabricated with SnO 2 gates show excellent transistor properties including saturation mobility of 15. 3 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1, a low subthreshold swing of ≈ 130 mV dec− 1, a high on/off ratio of ≈ 109, and an excellent electrical stability under constant-voltage stressing conditions to the gate terminal. Moreover, the SnO 2 -gated thin-film transistors show excellent electrical characteristics when used in electronic circuits such as negative channel metal oxide semiconductor (NMOS) inverters and ring oscillators. The NMOS inverters exhibit a low propagation stage delay of ≈ 150 ns with high DC voltage gain of ≈ 382. A high oscillation frequency of ≈ 303 kHz is obtained from the output sinusoidal signal of the 11 -stage NMOS inverter-based ring oscillators. These results show that SnO 2 can effectively replace ITO in transparent electronics and sensor applications...|$|R
40|$|CMOS/memristor hybrid {{architectures}} combine conventional CMOS processing elements with <b>thin-film</b> memristor-based crossbar <b>circuits</b> for high-density reconfigurable systems. These architectures {{have received}} an explosive growth in research {{over the past}} few years due to the first practical demonstration of a thin-film memristor in 2008. The reliability and lifetimes of both the CMOS and memristor partitions of these architectures are severely affected by temperature variations across the chip. Therefore, it is expected that dynamic thermal management (DTM) mechanisms will be needed to improve their reliability and lifetime. This thesis explores one aspect of DTM [...] thermal profiling [...] in a CMOS/memristor memory architecture. A temperature sensing resistive random access memory (TSRRAM) was designed. Temperature information is extracted from the TSRRAM by measuring the write time of thin-film memristors. Active and passive sensing mechanisms are also introduced as means for DTM algorithms to determine the thermal profile of the chip. Crosstherm, a simulation framework, was developed to analyze the effects of temperature variations in CMOS/memristor architectures. The TSRRAM design was simulated using the Crosstherm framework for four CMOS processor benchmarks. Passive sensing produced a mean absolute sensor error across all benchmarks of 2. 14 K. The size of the DTM unit 2 ̆ 7 s memory was also shown to have a significant impact on the accuracy of extracted thermal data during passive sensing. Active sensing was also demonstrated to show the effect of dynamic adjustment of sensor resolution on the accuracy of hotspot temperature estimations...|$|R
