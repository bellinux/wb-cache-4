[...] Kripke later confirmed this, stating, [...] "It's our view that John knew everything the producers of the show know. John knew stuff we're not even ready to reveal, that won't come out for a couple of seasons. He was an awesome hunter, {{and by the time he}} showed up in 'Dead Man's Blood', he knew it all." ...|$|E
500|$|Laucke took up snooker, {{and became}} {{competent}} enough by age thirteen {{to gain a}} job as a demonstrator for the Brunswick Corporation, a snooker table manufacturer. Laucke learned billiards from George Chenier, a fellow Montrealer and the North American snooker champion. The two faced each again four years later at the North American snooker championships in Montreal, where Laucke won the championship. Laucke recalled: [...] "Then I decided to leave snooker, I had done what I wanted to do... My love for the guitar was overwhelming. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> money in snooker, but snooker was just a passion, and music was my love." [...] Laucke used his snooker winnings to finance 110trips from Montreal to New York City to study the classical guitar with Franco-Spaniard Rolando Valdés-Blain.|$|E
500|$|... "The Last Sam Weiss" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly called the episode [...] "equally surprising in its plotting and pacing", praised Sam and Olivia's scenes together, and believed the ending to be [...] "mind-blowing" [...] and [...] "both startling and thrilling". The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded the episode with an A-, writing {{the first half}} [...] "wasn't quite as rollicking as , because <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> set-up and explanation required to keep the story moving" [...] but [...] "then the second half brought in all the emotion and tension, topped off by an unexpected gut-punch of an ending." [...] Murray admitted his [...] "eyes glazed over a bit" [...] during {{the search for the}} [...] "crowbar", believing it to be [...] "little too Lost-y", but [...] "the quirky Corrigan as Weiss helped put all the mumbo-jumbo over".|$|E

In order to keep up his intensity, Vedder traveled into San Francisco and began sleeping in his truck, {{as well as the}} sauna at the recording studio. Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "Recording Vs., <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> pressure on Ed. The whole follow-up. I thought we were playing so well as a band that it would take care of itself... He {{was having a hard time}} finishing up the songs; the pressure, and not being comfortable being in such a nice place." [...] Ament added that [...] "toward the end it got fairly intense" [...] and that the band [...] "tried to make it as uncomfortable for [...] as we could." [...] Eventually the band was able to get [...] "back on track" [...] according to Ament as Vedder was allowed [...] "to get in the space of his songs." [...] The album was finished in May 1993. Vedder later said, [...] "The second record, that was the one I enjoyed making the least... I just didn't feel comfortable in the place we were at because it was very comfortable. I didn't like that at all." ...|$|E

Jeff Montgomery of MTV both praised and dismissed Spears's performance saying, [...] "Yes, welcome to Britney's Circus, a big, huge, loud, funny, nonsensical three-ring affair... She looks great in her myriad of outfits, {{and she can}} still move {{with the best of}} them. [...] It's just, well, she's almost lost in the sheer hugeness of the production around her". Jane Stevenson of Toronto Sun gave Spears's performance three out of five stars stating there was [...] "so much was going on– there were also martial artists, bicyclists, etc.– {{there was no time to}} really assess Spears other than to note that she looked great. [...] She could lip-synch the words (one can assume) and strut around the stage well enough, but there was little in the way of genuine passion, joy, or excitement on her part". The Hollywood Reporters Craig Rosen claimed that [...] "in the end, Britney and company delivered an entertaining spectacle, but one couldn't help but wish that she would strip it all down and show a little more of herself". Sean Daly of St. Petersburg Times summed up all the reviews by stating, [...] "When Britney, touring behind her new Circus album, plays the Times Forum, there will be as many people rooting for her success as her failure. [...] But in the end, we're all envious and thankful, jealous and applauding. We like them/us and hate them/us for the very same reasons".|$|E

2500|$|However, {{this opinion}} {{apparently}} altered by 1993, when script-writers decided that Pete's storyline {{had come to}} a [...] "natural end" [...] and he was written out. Peter Dean went public with his criticism of the show, believing <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> his character had to offer and that the failure to come up with decent material for Pete was due to unimaginative scriptwriters. His exposé to The Sun newspaper included his suspicions of set secrets, such as earlier plans to write Pete out and his opinions about former co-stars. Following Dean's exposé, Pete was killed off-screen seven months after his initial exit. Peter Dean speculated that Pete's off-screen killing was a result of the exposé. Although this accusation has never been confirmed by the BBC, show creator Julia Smith had publicly decreed that derogatory stories sold by cast members to the press about the show's production would not be tolerated, and any cast member doing so would not return to the show.|$|E
