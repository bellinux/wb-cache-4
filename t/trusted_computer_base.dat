It is part of a de-velopment effort to produce prototype technologies for the World Wide Military Command and Control Sys-tem (WWMCCS) Information System (WIS). In this paper we present a series of criteria for evaluating data-base security approaches. We develop the high-level framework for the’security component of a DBMS and illustrate how it can support several alternative security models, which we compare using these criteria. The se-curity enforced by the DBMS relies an appropriate se-curity mechanisms enforced by the operating systems for operating system objects, such as files, used by the DBMS. We also present the security barrier or filter as an alternative or adjunct to the notion of a <b>trusted</b> <b>computer</b> <b>base.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a novel <b>trusted</b> {{terminal}} <b>computer</b> model <b>based</b> on {{embedded system}} is proposed, which aimed at building secure and trusted computing environments for terminal computers. The model can tolerate untrusted components {{being on the}} <b>trusted</b> <b>computer,</b> which doesnt need change hardware structure and operating system on the legacy terminal system. Taking advantage of embedded system and virtual machine, the model assured untrusted components being on the terminal computer cant cause serious information security threats, implement isolation of missions and manage I/O ports and communication resources on the terminal platform so that, the results of actions on it are expected and controlled. Compared with other trusted computing platforms, we can conclude that the trusted terminal model has virtues of permitting untrusted component being on the model, convenience of deploying applications, not needing TPM hardware and supporting legacy system...|$|R
40|$|Financial {{transactions}} {{that are made}} {{in an environment of}} imperfect knowledge will always contain a degree of risk. When dealing with humans or human organisations the relative knowledge about the co-operative behaviour of others can be perceived as trust, and trust therefore is a crucial factor in the decision making process. However, assessing trust becomes a problem in electronic transactions due to the impersonal aspects of computer networks. This paper proposes a scheme for propagating <b>trust</b> through <b>computer</b> networks <b>based</b> on public key certificates and trust relationships, and demonstrates how the resulting measures of trust can be used for making decisions about electronic transactions. 1 INTRODUCTION The concept of trust has received considerable attention in the information security literature, but it is rarely clear what people exactly mean by it. In a way, trust and security are just {{two sides of the same}} thing, because if a system is (in) secure, it is (dis) trusted, and if [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Through neglect, the {{national}} capability {{to design and}} construct <b>trusted</b> <b>computers</b> and networks has begun to atrophy. Not only has the information infrastructure been built weakly, but also our capability to strengthen it continues to decline. The Nation is now lacking in both {{the research and development}} talent to produce trusted computing systems and the educational infrastructure to create this talent. The Center for INFOSEC Studies and Research (CISR) in Monterey, California, proposes a three-pronged approach to strengthen {{the national}} information infrastructure and reinvigorate the national capability to produce trustworthy computing systems. First, we describe our Trusted Computing Exemplar project as a worked example of how trusted computing systems and components can be constructed. Second, we define a national research initiative to advance the theoretical foundations for trusted computing and to produce a set of automated tools to support the development of high assurance systemsand third, we define an education at initiative based on nascent information Assurance education programs and the Trusted Computing Exemplar to provide a framework for <b>Trusted</b> <b>Computer</b> Development education. The result of this multi-faceted approach will be to increase the security of the national Information Infrastructure by increasing the availability of: <b>Trusted</b> <b>Computer</b> systems and components, <b>Trusted</b> <b>Computer</b> development tools, and <b>Trusted</b> <b>Computer</b> developers, evaluators and educators...|$|R

40|$|Secure {{evaluation}} of polynomial using privacy ring homomorphisms Method of secure {{evaluation of}} polynomial y = F(x 1, …, xk) over some rings on untrusted computer is proposed. Two models of untrusted computer are considered: passive and active. In passive model untrusted computer correctly computes polynomial F {{and tries to}} know secret input (x 1, …, xk) and output y. In active model untrusted computer tries to know input and output and tries to change correct output y so that this change cannot be determined. Secure computation is proposed by using one-time privacy ring homomorphism �/n � → �/n�[z]/(f(z)), n = pq, generated by <b>trusted</b> <b>computer.</b> In the case of active model secret check point v = F(u 1, …, uk) is used. <b>Trusted</b> <b>computer</b> generates polynomial f(z) = (z − t) (z + t), t ∈ �/n � and input Xi(z) ∈ �/n�[z]/(f(z)) such that Xi(t) ≡ xi (mod n) for passive model, and f(z) = (z − t 1) (z − t 2) (z − t 3), ti ∈ �/n � and input Xi(z) ∈ �/n�[z]/(f(z)) such that Xi(t 1) ≡ xi (mod n), Xi(t 2) ≡ ui (mod n) for active model. Untrusted computer computes function Y(z) = F(X 1 (z), …, Xk(z)) in the ring �/n�[z]/(f(z)). For passive model <b>trusted</b> <b>computer</b> determines secret output y ≡ Y(t) (mod n).

40|$|Aim: This study aims to find {{awareness}} of healthcare practitioners and students about <b>computer</b> <b>based</b> patient education in central India. Methods: This study {{is based on}} questionnaire survey {{with a list of}} 8 questions. 250 doctors and medical students belonging to different areas of specialty were selected randomly from four different cities of central India. They filled out a questionnaire. Results: It is found that 100 % doctors and 97 % students of central India are aware of the use of computer in health science. 96 % of all healthcare workers are aware of <b>computer</b> <b>based</b> patient education method, however only 24 % of them use the <b>computer</b> <b>based</b> patient education in their practice. 81 % of doctors and 86 % students agreed about high cost of <b>computer</b> <b>based</b> patient education. 49 % doctors and 58 % students agreed that patient to patient variations in psychology, socioeconomic status and education are the main reasons because of which <b>computer</b> <b>based</b> patient education is not used by them. Conclusions: Healthcare practitioners and students of central India are aware of <b>computer</b> <b>based</b> patient education, but majority of them are not using it in their own practice. Hence healthcare practitioners of central India should be encouraged to use it. Undergraduate medical students found less aware about <b>computer</b> <b>based</b> patient education, so increase in {{awareness of}} undergraduate students is required in central India.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to examine how {{teachers}} use <b>computer</b> <b>based</b> assessment in their work and what user barriers they experience while working with <b>computer</b> <b>based</b> assessments. The result of the thesis is meant to provide an understanding of which factors affect the use of <b>computer</b> <b>based</b> assessments and how a company who provide <b>computer</b> <b>based</b> assessments applications can increase the rate of use amongst teachers. To investigate this, the author examined a company in Sweden who provide a <b>computer</b> <b>based</b> assessment application for both universities and high schools. The study was carried out at two different schools, a university and a high school, both located in Stockholm. In total nine teachers were interviewed. The author also conducted observations at the company whose <b>computer</b> <b>based</b> assessment application was examined. The author’s findings suggest {{that a lack of}} functions within the application and lack of costumer support from the company all negatively impacted the teacher’s use of the application. There were also findings that could suggest that a lack incentive to use the application may have negatively impacted teacher’s rate of use. To increase the rate of use, the author suggest that companies must work closer with teachers to understand their routines and develop applications accordingly. Companies should also be using teachers who already are using <b>computer</b> <b>based</b> assessment to develop incentives so that other teachers may start to use <b>computer</b> <b>based</b> assessments applications more frequentl...|$|R
