40|$|Experimental and {{analytical}} investigations {{were conducted to}} {{provide insight into the}} nonlinear cyclic response of moderate aspect ratio reinforced concrete structural walls. Five large-scale cantilever structural wall specimens, subjected to combined constant axial load and reversed cyclic lateral loading, were designed, constructed, instrumented, and tested. The wall specimens were designed to yield in flexure prior to loss of lateral load capacity. Primary test variables included aspect ratio (1. 5 and 2. 0), axial load level (0. 025 Agf'c and 0. 10 Agf'c), and wall shear stress level. Test results showed that substantial loss of lateral load capacity was observed for a variety of reasons, such as diagonal <b>tension,</b> <b>diagonal</b> compression, sliding shear, concrete crushing, and buckling of vertical reinforcement. Test results also indicated that significant strength loss was impacted by wall aspect ratio, axial load level, and wall shear stress level. Although various failure modes were observed for five wall specimens, drift ratio at substantial loss of lateral load capacity was approximately 3. 0 % for all tests. The average contribution of nonlinear shear deformations to the top lateral displacement varied between approximately 20 and 50 %, with lower values for the aspect ratio 2. 0 walls. Modeling parameters recommended by ASCE 41 - 06 and FEMA 356, including effective flexural and shear stiffness values, deformation capacities, and residual strengths, are compared with the corresponding values derived from test results. Current modeling approaches, including both uncoupled (P-M and V independent) and coupled (interaction between P-M and V) models, were used to assess their ability to capture the measured responses for the moderate aspect ratio structural walls. The investigation indicates that both models overestimate lateral load capacity and lateral stiffness, but with notable differences. In general, results for the uncoupled models are less consistent with the test results, indicating that coupled models are needed to adequately capture the responses of moderate aspect ratio walls. The primary shortcoming of the coupled model was the lack of cyclic material models. The detailed response information obtained from the heavily instrumented walls tested in this study provide essential data to develop robust analytical models, including models that account for cyclic nonlinear shear-flexure interaction...|$|E
40|$|Steel frames with {{reinforced}} concrete infill walls (SRCWs) are earthquake-resistant hybrid systems classified as Type 1 in EN 1998 - 1 [1] {{where they are}} considered to behave essentially as {{reinforced concrete}} walls able of dissipating energy in the vertical steel sections and in the vertical reinforcements of the walls. In addition, detailing provisions are the same provided for reinforced concrete walls except for indications on the edge shear connections. In reality, their behaviour might be very different and characterised by a resisting system in which diagonal compression struts develop within the reinforced concrete infill walls, resulting in cracks in the <b>tension</b> <b>diagonal</b> and crushing in the compression diagonal. Such issues are strictly related {{to the lack of}} a specific capacity design procedure that allows controlling the formation of a proper dissipating mechanism. Refined analyses previously carried out on SRCW systems [2] designed according to Eurocodes demonstrated an unsatisfactory fragile behaviour due to the severe damage occuring to concrete long before yielding of the ductile elements. The failure mechanism is generally characterised by yielding of the steel frame concentrated mainly in the elements {{near the bottom of the}} wall (more specifically at the connections of the horizontal to the vertical parts). The plastic deformation on the concrete infill walls concentrates in a diagonal path clearly indicating the distribution of cracking. In addition, localized plastic deformations are also present near the corners of the infill walls due to the local action of the first studs of the horizontal and vertical elements (Figure 1 a). The innovative system depicted in Figure 1 b is proposed to overcome the previous critical aspects. The RC infill walls are not connected to the vertical columns where the energy dissipation is expected. The system is conceived to control the formation of diagonal struts in the infill walls and behaves as a latticed brace instead of a shear wall. The energy dissipation takes place only in the vertical elements of the steel frame subjected mainly to axial forces without involving the reinforcements of the infill walls. Detailing of the connection of the dissipating elements should allow their replacement and the possible use of buckling-restrained elements. The formation of the diagonal strut is ensured by joint stiffeners and bearing plates (Figure 2). The joint may be welded in shops allowing speeding up the erection phases. The stud connectors are not required to transfer shear forces but they are used to connect the infill and the frame together during the seismic shakings...|$|E
40|$|The present {{graduation}} thesis {{deals with}} two different steel pallet racks Trimo VRS 2 and Trimo VRS 3. Pallet racks are not typical structures, as their variable load presents {{the most significant}} part of the gravity load. During an earthquake that variable load proves to have an advantageous influence on the racks' seismic load. We considered this with various factors. These factors are defined in the recommendations of pr FEM 10. 2. 08. A modal response spectrum analysis and a non-linear time history analysis were performed for both racks. We used the computer programme SAP 2000 and found out that SAP 2000 is not exactly good for time history analysis, because of problems with convergence. The VRS 3 rack was modelled as a spatial model and the VRS 2 rack, due to its symmetry, as a planar model. We made use of seven different earthquake records, and standardized them at the peak ground acceleration. The <b>tension</b> <b>diagonals</b> were modelled as non-linear plastic springs. We used Takeda modes as a hysteretic loop with zero compression strength. We also tested the influence of the reduced section of the <b>tension</b> <b>diagonals</b> on internal forces and displacements. Both racks already exist, which is the reason why we only made checkings of sections, stability and displacements. Results of time history analysis are less advantageous than results of modal analysis. Time history analysis with reduced section of <b>tension</b> <b>diagonals</b> contribute smaller internal forces but bigger displacements than constant sections of <b>tension</b> <b>diagonals...</b>|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Resistance of {{reinforced}} concrete beams to <b>diagonal</b> <b>tension</b> was studied {{in a series}} of papers which included beams without web reinforcement and beams with various types of web reinforcement. The magnitude of the loading causing the formation of initial <b>diagonal</b> <b>tension</b> cracks depended primarily on the dimensions of the cross section and on the strength of the concrete. The magnitude of the failure loads depended primarily on the dimensions of the cross section, on the amount of longitudinal reinforcement, on the amount of web reinforcement, on the strength of concrete, and on the length of shear span. Web reinforcement inclined at 45 deg to the axis of the beam is most effective in resisting the widening of the <b>diagonal</b> <b>tension</b> crack.

30|$|The {{onset of}} shear crack {{formation}} {{in all the}} beams initiated at the mid height of the beam web and was oriented along a line joining the loading and support points. Shear cracks of this nature {{are referred to as}} “diagonal tension cracks”, because the general direction of principal tension is perpendicular to this crack. The ligament of concert formed between adjacent <b>diagonal</b> <b>tension</b> cracks is referred to as a concrete compression strut. In the conventionally reinforced PC beams, the applied shear force is resisted by tension in transverse rebars and compression in the concrete strut (Schlaich et al. 1987).

The parameters which affect <b>diagonal</b> <b>tension</b> cracking have been defined by previous studies; however, much work needs be done in order to predict accurately the magnitude and influence on behavior of these parameters. The {{study was conducted in}} two phases; an analytical investigation of the amount of shear transferred across the face of a <b>diagonal</b> <b>tension</b> crack by the longitudinal steel and of the influence which the crack starting point has on tensile cracking, and an experimental investigation of the ratio of shearing stress to flexural stress at the root of a <b>diagonal</b> <b>tension</b> crack.

This study included both beams of normal weight and lightweight structural concrete, and the results of the computations made in this study show about the same amount of accuracy for beams of both types of concrete.
