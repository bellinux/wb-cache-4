As early as 1984, she began to develop a research and development team at Biocon, focusing on discovery of novel enzymes and on development of novel techniques for solid substrate fermentation technology. The company's first major expansion came in 1987, when Narayanan Vaghul of ICICI Ventures (Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India) supported creation of a venture capital fund of US$250,000. The money enabled Biocon to expand its research and development efforts.

The P. fluorescens isolates grow in iron deficient media because of production capacity of siderophore depends on iron content. Fifty nine Pseudomonas fluorescens were isolated in King's B media under 260 nm wavelengths from the rhizosphere and non-rhizospheric soil of cave, forest, fellow land and agriculture field in Chhattisgarh region. The amounts of siderophore produce by P. fluorescens isolates were screen in iron deficient succinate media {{and most of}} them were found positive for the production of much siderophores. One of the isolate from Pakhanjore area [...] "P3" [...] produce highest siderophore, which further assessed for plant growth promotion activities of crops rice, urd, mung and arhar. The study showed significantly higher increase in root length over control plants was observed in Rice (68.45%) followed by Urd (40.1%), Mung (33.71%) and Arhar (29.53%). Similarly, significantly higher increase in shoot length over control plants was observed in Rice (68.925%) followed by Urd (43.42%), Mung (39.96%) and Arhar (19.45%). It has been shown that these bacteria competitively colonize plant roots and cause the plant statistically significant root and shoot increases by stimulating plant growth and reduce the incidence of plant disease of above mention crops under green house of <b>tray</b> <b>culture</b> conditions.|$|E

40|$|A {{rapid and}} simple method for {{determining}} the sensitivity of human fibroblasts to ultraviolet light is described. As {{an alternative to the}} colony formation assay, this method can be used for the rapid diagnosis of ultraviolet light sensitivity in fibroblasts from photosensitive disorders. The method is based on growth of small numbers of cells in 1 -cm wells of <b>culture</b> <b>trays</b> for 4 or more days after irradiation and determination of cell survival by the incorporation of [3 H]hypoxanthine. D 37 values (the dose at which 37 % of the control level of incorporation remains) obtained from this procedure showed the same relative sensitivity of normal and xeroderma pigmentosum fibroblasts as was obtained by colony formation. Untransformed and SV 40 -transformed fibroblasts, which have different growth rates and different responses to high cell densities, gave different D 37 values by this assay in <b>culture</b> <b>trays</b> as compared with colony formation. Comparison of relative sensitivities to irradiation should therefore be made only between cell types with similar growth characteristics. The similar sensitivity of normal and xeroderma pigmentosum cells to mitomycin C was also determined by this <b>culture</b> <b>tray</b> method. By increasing cell density {{at the beginning of the}} experiments, a greater capacity of group C compared with group D fibroblasts for recovery from potentially lethal damage was also detected...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} tests were {{conducted}} to monitor atmospheric leakage rate and condensate production in NASA's Biomass Production Chamber (BPC). Water was circulated through the 64 plant <b>culture</b> <b>trays</b> inside the chamber during the tests but no plants were present. Environmental conditions were set to a 12 -hr photoperiod with either a matching 26 C (light) / 20 C (dark) thermoperiod, or a constant 23 C temperature. Leakage, as determined by carbon dioxide decay rates, averaged about 9. 8 percent for the 26 C/ 20 C regime and 7. 3 percent for the constant 23 C regime. Increasing the temperature from 20 C to 26 C caused a temporary increase in pressure (up to 0. 5 kPa) relative to ambient, while decreasing the temperature caused a temporary decrease in pressure of similar magnitude. Little pressure change was observed during transition between 23 C (light) and 23 C (dark). The lack of large pressure events under isothermal conditions may explain the lower leakage rate observed. When only the plant support inserts {{were placed in the}} <b>culture</b> <b>trays,</b> condensate production averaged about 37 liters per day. Placing acrylic germination covers over the tops of <b>culture</b> <b>trays</b> reduced condensate production to about 7 liters per day. During both tests, condensate production from the lower air handling system was 60 to 70 percent greater than from the upper system, suggesting imbalances exist in chilled and hot water flows for the two air handling systems. Results indicate that atmospheric leakage rates are sufficiently low to measure CO 2 exchange rates by plants and the accumulation of certain volatile contaminants (e. g., ethylene). Control system changes are recommended in order to balance operational differences (e. g., humidity and temperature) between the two halves of the chamber...|$|R

40|$|Membrane {{transport}} is {{a fundamental}} concept that undergraduate students of cell biology understand better with laboratory experience. Formal teaching exercises commonly used to illustrate this concept are unbiological, qualitative, or intricate and time consuming to prepare. We have developed an exercise that uses uptake of radiolabeled nutrient analogues by attachment-dependent animal cells cultured on multiwell trays. This system can readily be manipulated within a typical 3 -h laboratory period to yield reproducible, biologically relevant, quantitative data regarding key aspects of membrane transport. Each 24 -well <b>tray</b> of <b>cultures</b> allows a group of two to four students to compare eight conditions in triplicate. If different groups of students test different conditions or different types of cells, data can be shared for an even broader experience. The exercise is also readily adaptable for open-ended student projects. Here we illustrate the exercise measuring uptake of the nonmetabolizable glucose analogue [3 H]- 2 -deoxy-d-glucose.

40|$|In Agaricus bisporus, {{traditional}} cultivars {{and most}} of the wild populations belong to A. bisporus var. bisporus, which has a predominantly pseudohomothallic life cycle in which most meiospores are heterokaryons (n + n). A lower proportion of homokaryotic (n) meiospores, which typify the heterothallic life cycle, also are produced. In wild populations, pseudohomothallism was thought previously to play a major role, but recent analyses have found that significant outcrossing also may occur. We inoculated a standard substrate for A. bisporus cultivation simultaneously with homokaryotic mycelium from one parent and spores from a second parent. <b>Culture</b> <b>trays</b> produced numerous sporocarps that could theoretically have resulted from five different reproductive modes (pseudohomothallism, selfing or outcrossing via heterothallism, and selfing or outcrossing via the Buller phenomenon [i. e., between a homokaryon and a heterokaryon]). Most or all of the sporocarps resulted from outcrossing between the inoculated homokaryon and the inoculated heterokaryotic spores (or mycelia that grew from them).

Epidermal cells from neonatal foreskins were propagated to confluence in 24 -well <b>culture</b> <b>trays</b> and incubated with [125 I] EGF for binding assays. Association reached equilibrium within 2 – 4 hr at 4 ° and slightly earlier at 37 °. EGF bound at 37 ° dissociates very slowly from cells, since it can be shown to enter cells and is degraded to trichloracetic-acid-soluble material. Cells exposed to chloroquine, an inhibitor of lysosomal enzymes, fail to degrade internalized [125 I] EGF. Scatchard plots of the binding data yield a dissociation constant of 1 × 10 − 9 M and show that epidermal cells bind approximately 3 – 4 × 104 molecules of EGF. Cells exposed to EGF alter their ability to bind EGF by decreasing the number of binding sites in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Differentiation of epidermal cells in culture poses a problem in assessment of binding of EGF and possibly of other biologically active ligands, since cells lose the ability to bind EGF as they differentiate.

At 15 and 27 °C, maximum T- 2 toxin yield (265 and 50 μg/ml) was found after 10 to 14 and 7 days, respectively. The T- 2 toxin {{in the culture}} medium was metabolized rapidly at 27 °C and slowly at 15 °C. Addition of 0. 025 % (wt/vol) sorbic acid to the medium resulted in an increased production of trichothecenes at 15 °C (400 μg of T- 2 per ml after 14 days). Trichothecenes in the culture liquid were determined by the brine shrimp bioassay and physicochemical analysis. The brine shrimp assay was improved by using modern bioassay equipment, including tissue <b>culture</b> <b>trays</b> and multipipettes, and by a standardized approach with positive and negative controls.

Balb/c 3 T 3 cells were plated in 24 -well <b>culture</b> <b>trays</b> at 25, 000 cells/cm 2 around ten types of dental casting alloy (six samples/alloy) and incubated for 72 h. Cells were histochemically stained with MTT (3 -[4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) succinate for 2 h, then fixed, washed, and dried. Toxicity was measured by optical densitometer (OD) scanning, visual assessment, and 560 -nm absorbance of DMSO-solubilized dyes. Measurements of rings of inhibition were not used, because they did not provide precise data, and correlated poorly with the other methods. The results were analyzed by ANOVA, Tukey intervals, and coefficients of variation (CV's). MTT required shorter incubation times for adequate staining, allowed for solubilization of the monolayers, and was less expensive than NBT (2, 2 '-di-p-nitro-phenyl- 5, 5 '-diphenyl- 3, 3 '-dimethoxy-[3, 3 '-dimethoxy- 4, 4 '-biphenylene] ditetrazolium chloride). Results showed that all three methods ranked alloy toxicities similarly (p = 0. 05). The solubilization method was most discriminating due to lower CV's. Correlation between densitometer and solubilization methods was excellent (R 2 = 0. 96). Between-experiment CV's were generally less than 20 %, and often less than 10 %. Between-sample CV;s were generally less than 20 %. CV's were consistently lower for the solubilization method.

Cleaning regime {{had a significant effect}} on growth and survival (P < 0. 005). Lowest DVH (16. 2 ± 1. 0) was shown by oysters in uncleaned trays during 16 weeks compared to oysters in cleaned trays; however, {{there was no significant difference}} in DVH between oysters held in trays cleaned every 4 (19. 4 + 1. 2) or 8 weeks (21. 2 ± 0. 8). In contrast lowest survival was shown by oysters held in trays that were cleaned every 4 weeks (30 ± 5 %), but no differences were noted between oysters cleaned every 8 weeks (63 ± 4 %) and oysters that were left uncleaned for 16 weeks (75 ± 8 %). Predators of P. margaritifera in northern Australia included crabs, stomatopods, flatworms, gastropods and fish. The stomatopod, Gonodactylus falcatus. was the most destructive predator with individuals consuming in excess of 20 juvenile pearl oysters per week. The leather jacket, Paramonocanthus japonicus, did not kill pearl oysters, but trimmed the margin of oysters shells significantly reducing DVH when compared to control groups cultured without fish.

40|$|Conventionally, {{adherent}} {{cells are}} cultured in vitro using flat 2 D cell <b>culture</b> <b>trays.</b> However the 2 D cell culture method is tedious, unreliable {{and does not}} replicate {{the complexity of the}} 3 D dynamic environment of native tissue. Nowadays 3 D scaffolds can be used to culture cells. However a number of challenges still exist, including the need for destructive enzymes to release confluent cells. Poly(Nisopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm), a temperature responsive polymer, has revolutionised the cell culture fraternity by providing a non-invasive means of harvesting adherent cells, whereby confluent cells can be spontaneously released by simply cooling the cell culture medium and without requiring enzymes. While PNIPAAm monolayer cell culturing is a promising tool for engineering cell sheets, the current technology is largely limited to the use of flat 2 D substrates, which lacks structural and organisational cues for cells. The aim of this project was to develop a 3 D PNIPAAm scaffold which could be used efficiently for non-invasive 3 D culture of adherent cells. This project was divided into three phases: Phase 1 (preliminary phase) involved development and characterisation of cross-linked PNIPAAm hydrogels; Phase 2 involved development and characterisation of PNIPAAm grafted 3 D non-woven scaffolds, while Phase 3 focused on showing proof of concept for non-invasive temperature-induced cell culture from the 3 D PNIPAAm grafted scaffolds. In Phase 1, PNIPAAm was cross-linked with N,N’-methylene-bis-acrylamide (MBA) using solution free-radical polymerisation to form P(PNIPAAm-co-MBA) hydrogels. A broad cross-link density (i. e. 1. 1 - 9. 1 Mol% MBA) was investigated, and the effect of using mixed solvents as the co-polymerisation medium. The P(PNIPAAm-co-MBA) gels proved unsuitable as a robust cell culture matrix, due to poor porosity, slow swelling/deswelling and poor mechanical properties. Subsequently, in Phase 2, polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and nylon fibers were processed into highly porous non-woven fabric (NWF) scaffolds using a needle-punching technology. The NWF scaffolds were grafted with PNIPAAm using oxyfluorination-assisted graft polymerisation (OAGP). The OAGP method involved a 2 step process whereby the NWF was first fluorinated (direct fluorination or oxyfluorination) to introduce new functional groups on the fibre surface. The functionalised NWF scaffolds were then graft-polymerised with NIPAAm in an aqueous medium using ammonium persulphate as the initiator. Following oxyfluorination, new functional groups were detected {{on the surface of the}} NWF scaffolds, which included C-OH; C=O; CH 2 -CHF, and CHF-CHF. PP and nylon were both easily modified by oxyfluorination, while PET displayed very little changes to its surface groups. Improved wetting and swelling in water was observed for the oxyfluorinated polymers compared to pure NWF scaffolds. PP NWF showed the highest graft yield followed by nylon and then PET. PNIPAAm graft yield on the PP NWF was ~ 24 ± 6 μg/cm 2 on grafted pre-oxyfluorinated NWF when APS was used; which was found to be significantly higher compared to when pre-oxyfluorinated NWF was used without initiator (9 ± 6 μg/cm 2, p= 1. 7 x 10 - 7); or when grafting was on pure PP with APS (2 ± 0. 3 μg/cm 2, p = 8. 4 x 10 - 12). This corresponded to an average PNIPAAm layer thickness of ~ 220 ± 54 nm; 92 ± 60 nm; and 19 ± 3 nm respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed a rough surface morphology and confinement of the PNIPAAm graft layer to the surface of the fibers when oxyfluorinated NWF scaffolds were used, however when pure NWF scaffolds were used during grafting, homopolymerisation was observed as a loosely bound layer on the NWF surface. The OAGP method did not affect the crystalline phase of bulk PP as was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), however, twin-melting thermal peaks were detected from DSC for the oxyfluorinated PP and PP-g-PNIPAAm NWF which possibly indicated crystal defects. Contact angle studies and microcalorimetric DSC showed that the PP-g-PNIPAAm NWF scaffolds exhibited thermoresponsive behaviour. Using the 2, 2 -Diphenyl- 1 - 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical method and electron-spin resonance (ESR), peroxides, as well as trapped long-lived peroxy radicals were identified on the surface of the oxyfluorinated PP NWF, which are believed to be instrumental in initiating graft polymerisation from the NWF. A free radical mechanism which is diffusion controlled was proposed for the OAGP method with initiation via peroxy radicals (RO•), as well as SO 4 •- and OH• radicals, whereby the latter result from decomposition of APS. In Phase 3 of this study, proof-of-concept is demonstrated for use of the PNIPAAm grafted NWF scaffolds in non-invasive culture of hepatocytes. Studies demonstrated that hepatocyte cells attached onto the 3 D PNIPAAm scaffolds and remained viable in culture over long periods. The cells were released spontaneously and non-destructively as 3 D multi-cellular constructs by simply cooling the cell culture medium from 37 °C to 20 °C, without requiring destructive enzymes. The PP-g- PNIPAAm NWF scaffolds performed the best in 3 D cell culture. Additionally the CSIR is developing a thermo responsive 3 D (T 3 D) cell culturing device, whereby the 3 D thermo responsive NWF scaffolds are used in the bioreactor for cell culture. Temperature-induced cell release was also verified from the 3 D Thermo responsive scaffolds in the bioreactor. This technology could lead to significant advances in improving the reliability of the in vitro cell culture model.
