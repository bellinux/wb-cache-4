5|$|Jurisdiction over {{charitable}} disputes {{is shared}} equally between the High Court of Justice and the Charity Commission. The Commission, the first port of call, is tasked with regulating and promoting charitable trusts, {{as well as}} providing advice and opinions to trustees on administrative matters. Where the Commission feels there has been mismanagement or maladministration, it can sanction the trustees, removing them, appointing new ones or temporarily taking the <b>trust</b> <b>property</b> itself to prevent harm being done. Where there are flaws with a charity, the High Court can administer schemes directing the function of the charity, or even, under the Cy-près doctrine, change the purpose of the charity or gift altogether.|$|E
25|$|The {{beneficiaries}} are beneficial (or equitable) {{owners of}} the <b>trust</b> <b>property.</b> Either immediately or eventually, the beneficiaries will receive income from the <b>trust</b> <b>property,</b> or they will receive the property itself. The extent of a beneficiary's interest depends on {{the wording of the}} trust document. One beneficiary may be entitled to income (for example, interest from a bank account), whereas another may be entitled to the entirety of the <b>trust</b> <b>property</b> when he attains the age of twenty-five years. The settlor has much discretion when creating the trust, subject to some limitations imposed by law.|$|E

25|$|When {{trustees}} fail {{in their}} main duties, the law imposes remedies {{according to the}} nature of the breach. In general, breaches of rules surrounding performance of the trust's terms can be remedied through an award of specific performance, or compensation. Breaches of the duty of care will trigger a right to compensation. Breaches of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and misapplications of property will give rise to a restitutionary claim, to restore the property taken away. In these last two situations, the courts of equity developed further principles of liability that could be applied even when a trustee had gone bankrupt. Some recipients of property that came from a breach of trust, as well as people who had assisted in a breach of trust, might incur liability. Equity recognised not merely a personal, but also a proprietary claim over assets taken in breach of trust, and perhaps also profits made in breach of the duty of loyalty. A proprietary claim meant that the claimant could demand the thing in priority to other creditors of the bankrupt trustee. Alternatively, the courts would follow an asset or trace its value if the <b>trust</b> <b>property</b> was exchanged for some other asset. If <b>trust</b> <b>property</b> had been given to a third party, the trust fund could claim back the property as of right, unless the recipient was a bona fide purchaser. Generally, any recipient of <b>trust</b> <b>property</b> who knew about the breach of trust (or maybe ought to have known) could be made to give back the value, even if they had themselves exchanged the thing for other assets. Lastly, against people who may never have received <b>trust</b> <b>property</b> but had assisted in a breach of trust, and had done so dishonestly, a claim arose to return the property's value.|$|E
25|$|Express trust: An {{express trust}} arises where a settlor {{deliberately}} and consciously decides {{to create a}} trust, over their assets, either now, or upon his or her later death. In these cases this will be achieved by signing a trust instrument, which will either be a will or a trust deed. Almost all trusts {{dealt with in the}} trust industry are of this type. They contrast with resulting and constructive trusts. The intention of the parties to create the trust must be shown clearly by their language or conduct. For an express trust to exist, there must be certainty to the objects of the trust and the <b>trust</b> <b>property.</b> In the USA Statute of Frauds provisions require express trusts to be evidenced in writing if the <b>trust</b> <b>property</b> is above a certain value, or is real estate.|$|E
25|$|Unit trust: A trust {{where the}} {{beneficiaries}} (called unitholders) each possess a certain share (called units) and can direct the trustee to pay money to {{them out of}} the <b>trust</b> <b>property</b> according to the number of units they possess. A unit trust is a vehicle for collective investment, rather than disposition, as the person who gives the property to the trustee is also the beneficiary.|$|E

25|$|The second {{justification}} is one {{given by}} Lords Hodson and Guest in Boardman, which concerned {{the use of}} confidential information by a trustee for the trustee's personal gain. Hodson and Guest held that where such a situation arises, the constructive trust is justified not only to avoid conflicts of interest but also because such information is <b>trust</b> <b>property,</b> and using it for personal gain is misuse.|$|E
25|$|By {{his first}} wife he had nine {{children}} (three sons and six daughters) one of whom, Richard (1631–1695) was chancellor of the exchequer in William III's reign; from two of his daughters are descended the families of Trevor Hampden and Hobart-Hampden, the descent in the male line becoming apparently extinct in 1754 {{in the person of}} John Hampden. They lived at Hartwell House, Buckinghamshire, now a National <b>Trust</b> <b>property.</b>|$|E
25|$|Of course, Lord King LC {{was worried}} that {{trustees}} might exploit opportunities to use <b>trust</b> <b>property</b> for themselves instead of looking after it. Business speculators using trusts had just recently caused a stock market crash. Strict duties for trustees {{made their way into}} company law and were applied to directors and chief executive officers. Another example of a trustee's duty might be to invest property wisely or sell it. This is especially the case for pension funds, the most important form of trust, where investors are trustees for people's savings until retirement. But trusts can also be set up for charitable purposes, famous examples being the British Museum or the Rockefeller Foundation.|$|E

25|$|Justice was {{administered}} free of charge, by special officers appointed as judges and magistrates, but {{the king was}} supreme and the final arbiter in all civil and criminal cases. Mortgage, lease, <b>trust</b> <b>property,</b> loans, breach of contract were some common sources of civil litigation, while criminal offences included theft, adultery, forgery and treason. The punishments were very severe and hence crimes were rare: one {{caught in the act}} of burglary, adultery or spying was given the death penalty and one giving false testimony would have his tongue cut off. The king was the chief commander of the army and usually led his army in the battlefield. The military was said to be fourfold : the infantry, the cavalry, the elephantry and the chariotry. A wide variety of war weapons filled the military arsenal including shields, swords, spears, tridents, maces, bows and arrows. The main sources of royal revenue were taxes, tributes, customs duties and tolls. Land tax, paid in money or in kind, and income tax, equal to one-sixth of an individual’s income, were the major types of taxes collected. Other sources of revenue include tributes paid by feudal subordinates, war booty presents by loyal and visiting subjects, treasure troves besides land revenue, cess and forced gifts. The items incurring expenditure for the king include the military, gifts to poets and temples, maintenance of educational and health services, building infrastructure such as roads and irrigation and the palace household expenses.|$|E
25|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{important}} aspect of good trust management is to have good trustees. In virtually all cases, a settlor will have identified who trustees will be, but even if not or the chosen trustees refuse a court will, in the last resort appoint one under the Public Trustee Act 1906. A court may also replace trustees who are acting detrimentally to the trusts. Once a trust is running, Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 section 19 allow beneficiaries of full capacity to determine who the new trustees are, if other replacement procedures are not in the trust document. This is, however, simply an articulation of the general principle from Saunders v Vautier that beneficiaries of full age and sound mind may by consensus dissolve the trust, or do with the property as they wish. According to the Trustee Act 2000 sections 11 and 15, a trustee may not delegate their power to distribute <b>trust</b> <b>property</b> without liability, but they may delegate administrative functions, and the power to manage assets if accompanied with a policy statement. If they do, they can be exempt from negligence claims. For the trust terms, these may be varied in any unforeseen emergency, but only in relation to the trustee's management powers, not a beneficiary's rights. The Variation of Trusts Act 1958 allows courts to vary trust terms, particularly on behalf of minors, people not yet entitled, or with remoter interests under a discretionary trust. For the latter group of people, who may have highly restricted rights, or know very little about a trust terms, the Privy Council affirmed in Schmidt v Rosewood Trust Ltd that courts have an inherent jurisdiction to administer trusts, and this goes especially to a requirement for information about a trust to be disclosed.|$|E
500|$|It is a {{requirement}} that the subject matter be certain — that the property intended {{to be in the}} trust be separated from other property, showing clarity in what is intended to be <b>trust</b> <b>property.</b> If there is no clear separation, the trust will fail, as in Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd. This point was illustrated by Re London Wine Co (Shippers) Ltd, where creditors of a bankrupt wine trading company argued that {{they should be able to}} claim the wine they had paid for. The problem was that these bottles were not individually identifiable, and Oliver J held that: [...] A sum of money, say 10,000, does not satisfy the requirement, rendering uncertainty.|$|E
