500|$|Griswold {{moved to}} Albany, New York, {{to live with}} a 22-year-old flute-playing {{journalist}} named George C. Foster, a writer best known for his work New-York by Gas-Light. Griswold lived with Foster until he was 17, and the two may have had a romantic relationship. When Griswold moved away, Foster wrote to him begging him to return, signing his letter [...] "come <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> you love me". Griswold attempted to enroll at the Rensselaer School in 1830, but was not allowed to take any classes after he was caught attempting to play a prank on a professor.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} scene {{featuring}} Sandor [...] "the Hound" [...] Clegane, comedian Steve Love was cast {{as one of the}} Brotherhood members killed by the Hound. Love previously had become known for his impressions of various Game of Thrones characters, uploading the video to YouTube, which ultimately resulted in his appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Following the appearance, Love stated that he had received an email from Benioff offering him a part in the show, saying [...] "I broached the subject by sending them an email back saying 'Listen I don't know what your plans are for me but it would really mean a lot <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I could have one of those trademark Game of Thrones gruesome death scenes, and they wrote back saying 'Actually Steve, that was exactly what we had in mind for you.'" ...|$|E

'Tain't worth what the cargo would have been, of course, at least not money down. But I'll {{tell you what it}} appears to figure up <b>to.</b> Appears <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as <b>if</b> it amounted to about the bottom dollar of the man in 'Frisco." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{danger is}} perhaps not great if the people of one State, through their legislature, decide that Lady Chatterley's Lover goes so far beyond the {{acceptable}} standards of candor {{that it will be}} deemed offensive and non-sellable, for the State next door is still free to make its own choice. At least we do not have one uniform standard. But the dangers to free thought and expression are truly great if the Federal Government imposes a blanket ban over the Nation on such a book. [...] The fact that the people of one State cannot read some of the works of D. H. Lawrence seems <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> not wise or desirable, at least acceptable. But that no person in the United States should be allowed to do so {{seems to me to be}} intolerable, and violative of both the letter and spirit of the First Amendment.|$|E
500|$|After Harriet Adams died in 1982, her protégé, Nancy Axelrad, oversaw {{production}} of the Nancy Drew books briefly before the Stratemeyer Syndicate was sold to Simon & Schuster. Simon & Schuster turned to book packager Mega-Books for new writers. The books and Nancy's character began to change as a result, although there is disagreement {{on the nature of}} this change. Some contend that Nancy's character becomes [...] "more like Mildred Wirt Benson's original heroine than any [...] since 1956." [...] Others criticize the series for its increasing incorporation of romance and [...] " [...] of pre-feminist [...]" [...] For example, volume 78 in the series Update on Crime (1992) opens with Nancy wondering in italics, [...] "Am I or am I not in love with Ned Nickerson?" [...] Nancy begins dating other young men and acknowledges sexual desires: [...] "'I saw ... You don't have to apologize <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> some guy turns you on.' 'Gianni doesn't turn me on!... Won't you please let me explain.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an episode}} {{guide to the}} Anderson TV series, science-fiction writer John Peel {{questions}} Mac's ethics in [...] "experimenting on" [...] Joe to further {{the development of the}} BIG RAT. On the subject of Joe as a secret agent he remarks, jokingly, [...] "Presumably there are no child labour laws in the future!" [...] La Rivière's attention is drawn to one of Mac's lines {{at the end of the}} pilot, in a scene that he considers [...] "amusing"; the professor's admonition [...] "Don't come crying <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> you get hurt!" [...] represents his preparedness to [...] "abnegate all parental responsibility" [...] towards his adoptive son. Observing the series' subscription to [...] "wider themes in Cold War culture", Cull likens the BIG RAT's powers to brainwashing, but concludes that it is a fundamentally [...] "benign" [...] technology. The more violent style introduced in Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons is sometimes evident in Joe 90: in [...] "Hi-jacked", Joe kills an enemy with a grenade, while in [...] "Project 90", Professor McClaine is menaced by a drill poised to pulverise his head. On the subject of violence, episode director Desmond Saunders comments: [...] "There was an unpleasant side to it which I never really understood. There was something about it that was very strange and sinister." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{archive of}} Mari reports a plan between Zimri-Lim, {{the king of}} Carchemish and the king of Eshnunna (who made peace with Mari), to attack Qatna. Such an {{alliance}} {{could not have been}} realized without the participation of Yamhad, overlord of both Mari and Carchemish; in the end, the plan was not pursued and the tense relations between Qatna and Yamhad eased toward the last years of Yarim-Lim's reign. In a letter written to Zimri-Lim, Yarim-Lim I agreed to establish peace with Qatna if Amut-piʾel II were to come by himself to Aleppo, thus acknowledging the supremacy of Yamhad; no proof can be shown for a meeting taking place between the two kings. Just before his death in 1765 BC, Yarim-Lim called a meeting of his vassals, and Zimri-Lim traveled to Aleppo where he met messengers from Qatna and Hazor, indicating that Amut-piʾel II started recognizing the supremacy of Yarim-Lim, and that Hazor, Qatna's vassal, was now obeying Yamhad. Yarim-Lim's successor Hammurabi I arranged a peace with Qatna that probably did not require the Qaṭanean king to visit Aleppo personally, but indicated Qatna's acceptance of Yamhad's superiority. This apparent yielding seems a mere formality as Qatna continued its aspirations for power, as became clear in its behavior during the Elamite invasion of Mesopotamia in year ten of Zimri-Lim's reign. An Elamite messenger reached Emar and sent three of his servants to Qatna; Hammurabi I of Yamhad learned of this and sent troops to intercept them on their return. The servants were captured and questioned, revealing that Amut-piʾel II told them to tell their monarch that [...] "The country is delivered to you, come up <b>to</b> <b>me!</b> <b>if</b> you come up, you will not be taken by surprise." [...] The Qaṭanean king also sent two messengers to Elam, but they were probably captured in Babylon.|$|E

2500|$|Aly Raisman, a Jewish-American gymnast {{who won a}} {{gold medal}} at the 2012 London Olympics, {{expressed}} her support for a minute of silence at the Olympics, saying that, “The fact it was on the 40th anniversary is special, and winning the gold today means a lot <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>If</b> there had been a moment's silence, I would have supported it and respected it.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Commenting on the album's lyrics, Lewis said, [...] " [...] reflect {{things that}} I'm really passionate about. I {{have to be}} able to put myself in the song for it to ring true <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>If</b> it doesn't ring true to me, it's not going to be {{believable}} to anyone else." [...] Lewis described the album's style as [...] "classic songs with a contemporary edge", containing R and [...] "fresh pop" [...] styles, ballads and [...] "soulful up-tempo numbers". It has an American style, with some electronic 1980s sounds; however, the songs are not beat-driven or following the latest trends, but are songs that can be performed acoustically.|$|E
2500|$|He {{made his}} North American concert debut on 3 February 2007 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. The {{previous}} evening, Morricone had already {{presented at the}} United Nations a concert comprising some of his film themes, {{as well as the}} cantata Voci dal silenzio to welcome the new Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon. A Los Angeles Times review bemoaned the poor acoustics and opined of Morricone: [...] "His stick technique is adequate, but his charisma as a conductor is zero." [...] Morricone, though, has said: [...] "Conducting has never been important <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>If</b> the audience comes for my gestures, they had better stay outside." ...|$|E

2500|$|Schoenberg viewed his {{development}} as a natural progression, {{and he did not}} deprecate his earlier works when he ventured into serialism. In 1923 he wrote to the Swiss philanthropist Werner Reinhart: For the present, it matters more <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> people understand my older works ... They are the natural forerunners of my later works, and only those who understand and comprehend these will be able to gain an understanding of the later works that goes beyond a fashionable bare minimum. I do not attach so much importance to being a musical bogey-man as to being a natural continuer of properly-understood good old tradition! ( [...] ; quoted in [...] ) ...|$|E
2500|$|Though {{sometimes}} {{portrayed as}} a Satanist by the media, Danzig has denied this in several interviews, elaborating that [...] "I embrace both my light and dark side... I definitely believe in a yin and yang, good and evil. My religion is a patchwork of whatever is real <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>If</b> I can draw the strength {{to get through the}} day from something, that's religion... I'm not trying to be preachy or tell people what to think." [...] Danzig has voiced his approval of certain aspects of Satanic ideologies, including the quest for knowledge and individual freedom. He has stated that religion does not play a role in how he perceives other bands and musicians.|$|E
2500|$|As at her {{previous}} trial in 1973, Dugdale once again used the courtroom {{as a political}} platform, shouting [...] "The British have an army of occupation in {{a small part of}} Ireland—but not for long!" [...] during her arraignment in Dublin. Dugdale's father issued a statement saying [...] "I don't want to appear hardhearted, but I've done everything I can for her. She knows perfectly well she could turn <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> she wanted to". In Dugdale's submission to the court during her trial she denounced Britain as [...] "a filthy enemy" [...] and stated the Dublin government was guilty of [...] "treacherous collaboration" [...] with England. On 25 June 1974 she was sentenced to nine years imprisonment after pleading [...] "proudly and incorruptibly guilty", and she gave a clenched fist salute to supporters in the public gallery.|$|E

2500|$|Olivia {{restricted}} {{contact between}} the two after the trip. [...] Days before Pound was to leave for an extended stay in the US, Dorothy wrote him promising to abide by her mother's stricture and exhorting him to follow her lead: [...] "In case I do not see you alone on Wednesday, I take it that during your 'exile' you have been forbidden to write <b>to</b> <b>me?....</b> <b>if</b> you have promised—don't break your word—don't write to me!" [...] Olivia allowed Dorothy to write a thank-you note when Pound's Canzoni were published—that he dedicated to Olivia and Dorothy—the only instance when she let Dorothy contact him directly. John Harwood, Olivia Sharkespear biographer, [...] writes that Dorothy's lack of resistance seems extreme, even by Edwardian standards; however, he speculates that Olivia's motives were to keep Dorothy's behaviour controlled, whereas Pound's behaviour was ignored.|$|E
2500|$|Milošević's {{supporters}} say the anti-bureaucratic revolution was an authentic grass-roots political movement. Reacting to the indictment, Dr. Branko Kostić, Montenegro's then-representative on the Yugoslav state presidency said, [...] "Well, {{it sounds like}} nonsense <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>If</b> a government or a leadership were supportive of Milošević, {{then it would be}} normal for him to feel indebted to them, not the other way around." [...] He said Milošević enjoyed genuine grassroots support because [...] "his name at that time shone brightly on the political arena of the entire federal Yugoslavia... and many people saw him as a person who would be finally able to make things move, to get things going." [...] Kosta Bulatović, an organizer of the anti-bureaucratic rallies, said [...] "All of this was spontaneous" [...] the motivation to protest was [...] "coming from the grassroots." ...|$|E
2500|$|An adulterous Anne is {{imagined}} by James Joyce's character Stephen Dedalus, {{who makes}} a number of references to Hathaway. In Ulysses, he speculates that {{the gift of the}} infamous [...] "second-best bed" [...] was a punishment for her adultery, and earlier in the same novel, Dedalus analyses Shakespeare's marriage with a pun: [...] "He chose badly? He was chosen, it seems <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>If</b> others have their will Ann hath a way." [...] Anne also appears in Hubert Osborne's The Shakespeare Play (c.1911) and its sequel The Good Men Do (1917), which dramatises a meeting between the newly widowed Anne and her supposed old rival for William's love [...] "Anne Whateley". Anne is depicted as shrewish in the first play, and as spiteful towards her former rival in the latter. A frosty relationship is also portrayed in Edward Bond's play [...] (1973), about Shakespeare's last days, and in the 1978 TV series Will Shakespeare.|$|E
