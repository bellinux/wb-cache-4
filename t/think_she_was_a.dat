500|$|The {{photographer}} Charles Brittin, {{who knew}} Cameron on Los Angeles' artistic circuit, called her [...] "a sweet {{person with a}} great personality, not the way some of her friends wanted to picture her to be". Her friend Shirley Berman described her as having [...] "many different crowds of friends, and I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> different personality with each crowd... She wasn't an even personality at all, but she was always a very gracious person." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Jenny Harrison was named as a [...] "favourite" [...] to Shortland Street viewers. Harper herself {{did not enjoy}} playing Jenny when the soap began, but influenced the characters development with her own personality, she stated, [...] "At first, I thought Jenny {{was a bit of}} a victim [...] They've made her a stronger character now. I got sick of her being so passive. It was annoying to play and I don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good role model, either." [...] Jenny's abortion in 1995 was seen as highly controversial and several complaints were made to the Broadcasting Standards Authority, though none were upheld. A storyline featuring Jenny developing a cyst was introduced to the soap but never continued due to the writers effectively forgetting about it. This later became a codename, [...] "Jenny's cyst", for forgotten or misplaced storylines occurring in the soap. 2011 advertisements for repeats of the soap's original episodes, noted Jenny as one of the featured characters to entice an audience.|$|E

He'd be sure to <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> nigger, {{or at least a}} Creole. But I shan't do that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{is looking}} at us," [...] she said. [...] "She is {{standing}} behind that tree looking at us. She wanted so much to grow into a dear, good woman that she often comes {{and looks at me}} eagerly. Sometimes her face is so fearful! I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little alarmed when she heard you were coming back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Hardman, my love, {{was a very}} strong-minded young lady, of most {{distinguished}} talents. The aristocracy are decidedly a very superior class, you know, both physically, and morally, and mentally; as a high Tory I acknowledge that. I could not describe the dignity of her voice and mien as she addressed me thus; still, I fear she was selfish, my dear. I would never wish to speak ill of my superiors in rank, but I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little selfish." ...|$|E

25|$|Juno Regina {{is perhaps}} the epithet most fraught with questions.

6000|$|... "He's my husband," [...] she {{announced}} {{in a great}} shout, throwing herself back in the chair. Perceiving the joke, she laughed immoderately with a handkerchief to her eyes, while he sat wearing a forced smile, and, from his inexperience of jolly women, fully persuaded that she must be deplorably insane. They were excellent friends afterwards; for, absolving her from irreverent intention, he came to <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very worthy person indeed; and he learned in time to receive without flinching other scraps of Solomon's wisdom.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Bea's cousin Tina {{comes in}} right along, and the foreman at the mill, and----Oh, {{we have good}} times. Say, {{take a look at}} that Bea!

Way she fusses over me--way she makes old Miles wear a necktie! Hate to spoil her by letting her hear it, but she's one pretty darn nice--nice----Hell! What do we care if none of the dirty snobs come and call? We've got each other." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{attempted}} {{to tell her}} what difference, but I've no space to follow him here. It's known that when the German mind attempts to explain things it doesn't always reduce them to simplicity, and Pandora was first mystified, then amused, by some of the Count's revelations. At last I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little frightened, for she remarked irrelevantly, with some decision, that luncheon would be ready and that they ought to join Mrs. Steuben. Her companion walked slowly, on purpose, as they left the house together, for he knew the pang of a vague sense that he was losing her.|$|E
5000|$|... "Miss Rivers. Her book ‘This Man’ is {{certainly}} her best work. ... the strange thing is {{her ability to}} draw male nudes—I have never known a woman draw the male body well before … <b>She</b> … <b>is</b> awfully interesting though very reserved … I really <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> genius mislaid." ...|$|R

60|$|They {{found him}} {{dead at the}} bottom of it. So, you see, there is only me, the Chinaman, the half-caste woman that we call the Memsahib (she used to live with Fung-Tching), the other Eurasian, and one of the Persians. The Memsahib looks very old now. I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> young woman when the Gate was opened; but we are all old for the matter of that. Hundreds and {{hundreds}} of years old. It is very hard to keep count of time in the Gate, and besides, time doesn't matter to me. I draw my sixty rupees fresh and fresh every month.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, that bird," [...] {{he would}} say, [...] "is, maybe, {{two hundred years}} old, Hawkins--they live forever mostly; and if anybody's seen more wickedness, {{it must be the}} devil himself. She's sailed with England, the great Cap'n England, the pirate. She's been at Madagascar, and at Malabar, and Surinam, and Providence, and Portobello. She was at the fishing up of the wrecked plate ships. It's there she learned 'Pieces of eight,' and little wonder; three hundred and fifty {{thousand}} of 'em, Hawkins! She was at the boarding of the viceroy of the Indies out of Goa, she was; and to look at her you would <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> babby. But you smelt powder--didn't you, cap'n?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was this}} woman, now in health, whom I intrusted with the {{purchase}} of the outfits, [...] "one for a boy of six months," [...] I explained to her, [...] "and one for a boy of a year," [...] for the painter had boasted to me of David's rapid growth. I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little surprised to find that both outfits were for the same house; and she certainly betrayed an ignoble curiosity about the mother's Christian name, but she was much easier to brow-beat than a fine lady would have been, and I am sure she and her daughter enjoyed themselves hugely in the shops, from one of which I shall never forget Irene emerging proudly with a commissionaire, who conducted her under an umbrella to the cab where I was lying in wait. I think that was the most celestial walk of Irene's life.|$|E

5000|$|Gunn {{was awarded}} the inaugural Sovereign European Art Prize in 2006 ahead of 300 artists from over twenty {{countries}} with her 10 feet high red painting, Specto Specus I & II.

6000|$|Speaking aloud, he said: [...] "Miss Moore {{travels the}} trail with all known accessories, and I've no doubt <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> grand campaigner; but I <b>am</b> {{wondering}} how <b>she</b> would stand such a trip as {{that you took}} last night.

6000|$|... "I hope he will," [...] said Cecily cruelly. She {{was truly}} vexed over the letter; and yet, so {{contradictory}} {{a thing is}} the feminine heart, even at twelve years old, I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little flattered by it also. It was her first love letter and she confided {{to me that it}} gives you a very queer feeling to get it. At all events--the letter, though unanswered, was not torn up. I feel sure Cecily preserved it. But she walked past Cyrus next morning at school with a frozen countenance, evincing not the slightest pity for his pangs of unrequited affection. Cecily winced when Pat caught a mouse, visited a school chum the day the pigs were killed that she might not hear their squealing, and would not have stepped on a caterpillar for anything; yet she did not care at all how much she made the brisk Cyrus suffer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; and I {{answered}} {{a lot of}} questions. Miss Rogerson asked ever so many. I don't think it was fair {{for her to do}} all the asking. There were lots I wanted to ask her, but I didn't like to because I didn't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> kindred spirit. Then all the other little girls recited a paraphrase. She asked me if I knew any. I told her I didn't, but I could recite, 'The Dog at His Master's Grave' if she liked. That's in the Third Royal Reader. It isn't a really truly religious piece of poetry, but it's so sad and melancholy that it might as well be. She said it wouldn't do and she told me to learn the nineteenth paraphrase for next Sunday. I read it over in church afterwards and it's splendid. There are two lines in particular that just thrill me.|$|E
60|$|They {{reached the}} crest of the last rise, and there, facing them on the slope of the {{opposite}} wave of land, stood the waggon, surrounded by the thorn fence, within which the cattle and horses were still enclosed, doubtless for fear of the Zulus. Nothing could be more peaceful than the aspect of that camp. To look at it no one would have believed that within a few hundred yards a hideous massacre had just taken place. Presently, however, voices began to shout, and heads to bob up over the fence. Then it occurred to Rachel that they must <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> prisoner in the charge of a Zulu, and she told Noie to lower the shield which she still held in front of her. The next instant some thorns were torn out, and her father, a gun in his hand, appeared striding towards them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, then; {{with many}} thanks, I will keep it." [...] She {{looked at the}} young man a moment, while her {{daughter}} walked away. Longueville thought her a delightful little person; she struck him {{as a sort of}} transfigured Quakeress--a mystic with a practical side. [...] "I <b>am</b> sure you <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>'s</b> <b>a</b> strange girl," [...] she said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Recollect {{what you}} and Eunice have done. You have shown your {{suspicion}} of her without an attempt to conceal it.

6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> English ship of war," [...] he said, when he {{descended to}} the deck, [...] "but <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> long way off.
