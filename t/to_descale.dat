It is possible to mechanically descale the wire but the method needs to be better since the current methods does not give consistent results. In this work the possiblity <b>to</b> <b>descale</b> the wire using ultrasounds have been investigated.

40|$|The {{first two}} {{sections}} summarize investigations in EBWR concenced with {{some aspects of}} water chemistry. The results {{of many of these}} investigations have not been previously published in a form given wide distribution. Included are studies of water conditions, corrosion products (composition, activities, transportation, deposition, and distribution), water dissociation, water activity, fission-product release, and build-up of plant activity. The last two sections of the report give the results of studies of the heattansfer characteristics of fuel-element scale and effects of high-temperature heating on scale removal and fuelelement growth. The maximum scale thickness measured was about 0. 008 in. Heat-transfer calculations based on scale thermal conductivity measurements indicate the possibility of maximum fuel temperatures as high at 1692 /sup o/F at 100 -Mw operation of the core. This temperature is in a range where fuel growth, with resulting fuel element distortion and damage, is expected. Observed trends that may alleviate damage are the tendency of scale to flake off in high-heat transfer areas and the restraining effect of cladding on growth of fuel.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{influence of}} fluid dynamics on aquatic organisms is receiving increasing attention among aquatic ecologists. For example, {{the importance of}} turbulence to ocean plankton {{has long been a}} subject of investigation (Peters and Redondo 1997). More recently, studies have begun to emerge that explicitly consider the effects of shear and turbulence on freshwater invertebrates (Statzner et al. 1988; Hart et al. 1996) and fishes (Pavlov et al. 1994, 1995). Hydraulic shear stress and turbulence are interdependent natural fluid phenomena that are important to fish, and consequently it is important to develop an understanding of how fish sense, react to, and perhaps utilize these phenomena under normal river flows. The appropriate reaction to turbulence may promote movement of migratory fish or prevent displacement of resident fish. It has been suggested that one of the adverse effects of flow regulation by hydroelectric projects is the reduction of normal turbulence, particularly in the headwaters of reservoirs, which can lead to disorientation and slowing of migration (Williams et al. 1996; Coutant et al. 1997; Coutant 1998). On the other hand, greatly elevated levels of shear and turbulence may be injurious to fish; injuries can range from removal of the mucous layer on the body surface <b>to</b> <b>descaling</b> <b>to</b> torn opercula, popped eyes, and decapitation (Neitzel et al. 2000 a,b). Damaging levels of fluid stress can occur in a variety of circumstances in both natural and man-made environments. This paper discusses the effects of shear stress and turbulence on fish, with an emphasis on potentially damaging levels in man-made environments. It defines these phenomena, describes studies that have been conducted to understand their effects, and identifies gaps in our knowledge. In particular, this report reviews the available information on the levels of turbulence that can occur within hydroelectric power plants, and the associated biological effects. The final section provides the preliminary design of an experimental apparatus that will be used to expose fish to representative levels of turbulence in the laboratory...|$|R
40|$|Many basic {{aspects of}} surface {{treatment}} with Excimer laser radiation {{have been investigated}} {{and it has been}} shown that the processing results are affected by variations of the processing variables as well as by irregularities of the workpiece. Therefore the development of on-line process control systems is of great importance for an increase in reproducibility and further acceptance of Excimer laser processing in production line. To ensure high machining quality and short machining time the processing result and all significant processing parameters has to be analyzed and controlled in realtime. One promising technique of surface treatment is scale removal to improve the corrosion resistance of austenitic steel. For this application the varying thickness and composition of the scale layer require an adaption of the processing parameters (fluence and number of laser pulses per site) to the local surface conditions. A process diagnosis based on Plasma Emission Spectroscopy (PES) is build up for this application. Another application of interest is selective removal of corrosion layers on historical glass paintings to increase light transmission. Because the corrosion layers have varying composition and thickness a process diagnosis with a probe laser and an optical sensor is used to measure the transmittivity of the layer. A process control system is build up for real time diagnosis of removal processes with Excimer laser radiation. The system is applied <b>to</b> <b>descaling</b> of steel. For selective removal of corrosion layers on glass a closed loop control has been developed to guarantee a high processing quality without damaging the glass...|$|R

Effective primary descaling, i. e. descaling post furnace discharge via washbox or alternative technologies is imperative to obtain good surface quality and conditioning of the surface state as well as the morphology, growth and behaviour of the secondary/tertiary scale. This paper primarily focuses on analytical descaling concepts for both mechanical and thermal outputs for flat jet nozzle and process factors.

This effect was associated with the elimination of the subscale containing nickel enriched metal tendrils and chromite (spinel). This subscale is characteristic of reheated austenitic stainless steel which does not have mould flux residues.

Dose- and time-response studies indicated that application of the amphiphilic mimetic in water induced pheromone production in as little as 15 min after application and that the effects were maintained for prolonged periods.

40|$|Abstract. Some {{surface defects}} on hot rolled steels arise due <b>to</b> poor <b>descaling.</b> Generally reheated slabs are {{efficiently}} descaled but, now and then, residual scale {{remains on the}} slab after primary descaling. Commonly {{it is difficult to}} trace the few poorly descaled slabs since there often is no scale monitoring system. In the work presented here an image based primary scale monitoring- and evaluation system is presented. It is a stand-alone online vision system consisting of a camera connected to a computer. The camera is located directly after the descaling unit and the computer in the control room. The program automatically locates the boundaries of the top surface of a slab and calculates the quantity of residual scale on the top surface. The quantity of residual scale is logged and can afterwards be evaluated together with process parameters and downstream surface defects to identify problem areas. The system has been tested in industrial scale in the Ruukki plate mill. This work is a cooperation between Swerea MEFOS and Ruukki. The result of the test demonstrated the feasibility of using vision system for detection of residual scale. Some problems were identified and suggestions for solving them are reported. If the suggested modifications are carried out, it is believed that the vision system can be an on-line tool for the operator and also be an off-line resource for the ongoing quality work at the hot rolling mill...|$|R

The process of heating and cooling in relation <b>to</b> wing type (<b>descaled,</b> darkened and original wing colour) and size was examined using dummies (i. e. dried butter ̄ies). Size (measured as wing length) and ambient temperature have a joint in ̄uence on body temperature: large butter ̄ies heat up more slowly than small ones, but with increasing ambient temperature the difference with size became smaller and even changed since large individuals heated up faster under warm ambient conditions. Surprisingly, darkening wings had no overall effect on thermal characteristics, but this may be an artefact of the manipulation as supported {{by the results of}} the absorption measurements. Normal butter ̄ies reached a higher equilibrium thoracic temperature than descaled butter ̄ies probably because wings without scales absorb less radiation. Finally, butter ̄ies with fully spread wings reached higher thoracic temperature and had faster cooling rates compared to butter ̄ies with half-opened wings. Implications of the results for the relation between morphology and behaviour of speckled wood butter ̄ies in their natural habitat are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{behavior of}} an {{austenitic stainless steel}} (UNS S 30400) has been characterized in a 10, 000 hour test conducted in hydrogenated, ammoniated water at 260 C. The corrosion kinetics were observed to follow a parabolic rate dependency, the parabolic rate constant being determined by chemical <b>descaling</b> <b>to</b> be 1. 16 mg dm{sup - 2 } hr{sup - 1 / 2 }. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in combination with argon ion milling and target factor analysis, was applied to provide an independent estimate of the rate constant that agreed with the gravimetric result. Based {{on the distribution of}} the three oxidized alloying constituents (Fe, Cr, Ni) with respect to depth and elemental state, it was found that: (a) corrosion occurs in a non-selective manner, and (b) the corrosion film consists of two spinel oxide layers [...] a ferrite-based outer layer (Ni{sub 0. 2 }Fe{sub 0. 8 }) (Fe{sub 0. 95 }Cr{sub 0. 05 }) {sub 2 }O{sub 4 } on top of a chromite-based inner layer (Ni{sub 0. 2 }Fe{sub 0. 8 }) (Cr{sub 0. 7 }Fe{sub 0. 3 }) {sub 2 }O{sub 4 }.

40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} {{radioactive material}} (NORM) exists in connate waters and, {{under the right}} conditions during oil drilling, can plate out on the interior surfaces {{of oil and gas}} industry equipment. Once deposited, this material is commonly referred to as ??scale. ?? This thesis is concerned with the presence of 226 Ra in scale deposited on the inner surfaces of oil drilling pipes and the internal dose consequences of inhalation of that scale once released. In the process of normal operation, barium sulfate scale with a radium component adheres to the inside of downhole tubulars in oil fields. When crude flow is diminished below acceptable operational requirements, the pipe is sent <b>to</b> a <b>descaling</b> operation <b>to</b> be cleaned, most likely by a method known as rattling. The rattling process generates dust. This research investigated the chemical composition of that aerosol and measured the solubility of pipe scale from three oilfield formations. Using standard in-vitro dissolution experimental equipment and methods, pipe scale is introduced into simulated lung fluid over a two-week period. These samples are analyzed using quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Q-ICP-MS), known for very low detection limits. Analysis reveals virtually no 226 Ra present in the lung fluid exposed to pipe scale. Sample measurements were compared against background measurements using Student??s t test, which revealed that nearly all the samples were statistically insignificant in comparison to the lung fluid blanks. This statistical test proves within a 95 % confidence interval that there is no 226 Ra present in the lung fluid samples. These results indicate that inhaled NORM pipe scale should be classified as Class S and serve to further confirm the extreme insolubility of petroleum pipe scale. For dose calculations, the S classification means that the lung is the main organ of concern. Radium- 226 from petroleum pipe scale does not solubilize in the interstitial lung fluid, and does not, therefore, enter the bloodstream via respiratory pathways. Since there is no removal by dissolution, the 500 day biological half-life implied by the S classification is based solely on the mechanical transport of 226 Ra out of the lungs by phagocytosis or the mucociliary escalator...|$|R

These strains were significantly more pathogenic than the other strains tested. Moreover, (Hussein and Hatai 2002) reported that the cumulative mortalities of the different salmonids fish groups exposed to 2 × 105 spore/L concentrations of S. salmonis NJM 9851 were 90 % for brown trout, 93.3 % for sockeye salmon and 100 % for rainbow trout, masu salmon, and Japanese char, however; all salmonid species exposed to 2 × 105 spore/L concentrations of S. parasitica NJM 9868 had a cumulative mortalities of 100 %.

40|$|This is {{the seventh}} {{year of a}} multi-year project, {{monitoring}} the outmigration and survival of juvenile salmonids in the lower Umatilla River. This project both supplements and complements ongoing and completed work within the Umatilla River basin. Knowledge gained on juvenile outmigration and survival assists researchers and managers in adapting hatchery practices, flow enhancement strategies, canal and fish ladder operations, and supplementation and enhancement efforts of natural and restored fish populations. Findings from this study also measure the success of upriver habitat improvement projects and provide an overall evaluation of the Umatilla River fisheries restoration program. The general objectives for 2001 were to: (1) Estimate migrant abundance and survival and determine migration parameters of PIT-tagged hatchery and natural juvenile salmonids; (2) Monitor natural production and estimate overall abundance of pacific lamprey, chinook and coho salmon and summer steelhead; (3) Assess the condition and health of migrants and determine length-frequency distributions through time; (4) Investigate the effects of canal and fishway operations and environmental conditions on fish migration and survival; (5) Investigate and implement improved tag monitoring capabilities; and (6) Participate in planning and coordination activities within the basin and disseminate results. More specifically, 2001 objectives included the ongoing evaluation of migrant abundance and survival of tagged hatchery fish groups from various species-specific hatchery, rearing, acclimation and release strategies; fourth year reach survival results; continuation of transport evaluation studies; outmigrant monitoring and estimation of natural abundance, and further investigation {{of the effects of}} canal operations, environmental factors, fish condition and health on migration, abundance and survival. Some of the key findings for 2001 are: (1) A significant decline in outmigrant abundance of natural salmonids compared with the upward trend of previous years; (2) An undetermined number of hatchery summer steelhead are overwintering in the Umatilla River and migrating out as 2 -year old smolts; (3) Transported fish may have a survival advantage over non-transported fish; (4) Migrant survival of fish from the Little White, Carson and Herman Creek hatcheries may have been influenced by disease in 2001; (5) Acclimation may benefit migrant survival of subyearling fall chinook; (6) Overwintering of spring chinook in acclimation ponds may not provide a survival advantage over standard-acclimated fish; and (7) Fish sampled in 2001 tended <b>to</b> be <b>descaled</b> and injured at a higher rate compared with previous years...|$|R

The corrosion kinetics are observed to be parabolic, the parabolic rate constant being determined by chemical <b>descaling</b> <b>to</b> be 0. 055 mg dm{sup - 2 } hr{sup - 1 / 2 }. A combination of scanning and transmission electron microscopy, supplemented by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, {{are used to}} identify the oxide phases present (i. e., spinel) and to characterize their morphology and thickness. Two oxide layers are identified: an outer, ferrite-rich layer and an inner, chromite-rich layer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with argon ion milling and target factor analysis is applied to determine spinel stoichiometry; the inner layer is (Ni{sub 0. 7 }Fe{sub 0. 3 }) (Fe{sub 0. 3 }Cr{sub 0. 7 }) {sub 2 }O{sub 4 }, while the outer layer is (Ni{sub 0. 9 }Fe{sub 0. 1 }) (Fe{sub 0. 85 }Cr{sub 0. 15 }) {sub 2 }O{sub 4 }.

40|$|A {{doctoral}} thesis submitted in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the award of PhD of Loughborough University. During manufacturing, stainless steels will experience high temperatures at many steps: continuous casting, reheat, rolling and annealing. After continuous casting, it is usual for the ascast metal to cool to ambient temperatures. In order to achieve successful hot forming, the metal must then be reheated to a suitable temperature. This process is called "reheat", and commonly takes place in large, propane-fired walking beam furnaces at temperatures in excess of 1200 °C for times of 2 or more hours. During reheat, a thick oxide scale will form which, if left in place during cold working, may cause damage {{to the surface of}} the final cold rolled product. As a result, manufacturers generally apply a mechanical descaling procedure immediately prior to rolling. In order to study the effect of reheat conditions on the oxide scale formation, austenitic grades (Types 316 L and 304) and duplex grades (Types S 32101 and S 32205) were oxidised. The temperatures used ranged from 700 °C through to 1300 °C for times up to, and including, 5 hours. The results of the heat treatments were investigated using a range of analytical techniques including: scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and site specific cross-section preparation using focused ion beam for both SEM investigation and transmission electron microscopy analysis. The use of these techniques has provided a thorough description of oxides that are expected to form at a variety of temperatures and conditions. On austenitic grades a number of sub-surface oxide structures form, such as dendritic internal oxide particles and sub-surface oxide layering, which may pose great challenges <b>to</b> the mechanical <b>descaling</b> processes. External oxidation has not been neglected in this study and complex chemical and phase distributions within external oxide scales have been characterised. The presence of an as-cast oxide scale during reheat does not have a substantial effect on the reheat oxide formed, however, the as-cast microstructure may contribute to the formation of subsurface oxide banding. Duplex stainless steels produce oxides which are highly dependant on the phase distribution and surface finish of the substrate. Large scale oxide nodules have been found to form only on the austenite with an apparently protective thinner oxide present on the ferrite. The formation of these nodules has been studied from the initial stages of oxidation by the use of environmental SEM and site-specific preparation of important features to reveal that nodules form where the thin, protective chromium rich layer chemically fails during oxidation enabling local breakaway regions to form...|$|R
