5|$|There was a {{good deal}} of {{interest}} in the 2004 transit as scientists attempted to measure the pattern of light dimming as Venus blocked out some of the Sun's light, in order to refine techniques that they hope to use in searching for extrasolar planets. Current methods of looking for planets orbiting other stars only work for a few cases: planets that are very large (Jupiter-like, not Earth-like), whose gravity is strong enough <b>to</b> <b>wobble</b> the star sufficiently for us to detect changes in proper motion or Doppler shift changes in radial velocity; Jupiter or Neptune sized planets very close to their parent star whose transit causes changes in the luminosity of the star; or planets which pass in front of background stars with the planet-parent star separation comparable to the Einstein ring and cause gravitational microlensing. Measuring light intensity {{during the course of a}} transit, as the planet blocks out some of the light, is potentially much more sensitive, and might be used to find smaller planets. However, extremely precise measurement is needed: for example, the transit of Venus causes the amount of light received from the Sun to drop by a fraction of 0.001 (that is, to 99.9% of its nominal value), and the dimming produced by small extrasolar planets will be similarly tiny.|$|E

25|$|Otto Struve {{proposed}} in 1952 {{the use of}} powerful spectrographs to detect distant planets. He described how a very large planet, as large as Jupiter, for example, would cause its parent star <b>to</b> <b>wobble</b> slightly as the two objects orbit around their center of mass. He predicted that the small Doppler shifts to the light emitted by the star, caused by its continuously varying radial velocity, would be detectable by the most sensitive spectrographs as tiny red shifts and blue shifts in the star's emission. However, the technology of the time produced radial-velocity measurements with errors of 1,000m/s or more, making them useless {{for the detection of}} orbiting planets. The expected changes in radial velocity are very small – Jupiter causes the Sun to change velocity by about 12.4m/s over a period of 12 years, and the Earth's effect is only 0.1m/s over a period of 1 year – so long-term observations by instruments with a very high resolution are required.|$|E
