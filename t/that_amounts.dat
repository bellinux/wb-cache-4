The concept of signed-digit representation has also been taken up in computer design.|$|E

25|$|From the 1980s the UK {{government}} passed several {{acts that}} had a provision concerning sectarian violence. These included the Public Order Act 1986, which introduced offences relating to the incitement of racial hatred, and the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which introduced offences of pursuing a racially aggravated course of conduct <b>that</b> <b>amounts</b> to harassment of a person. The 1998 Act also required courts {{to take into account}} where offences are racially motivated, when determining sentence. In the twenty-first century the Scottish Parliament legislated against sectarianism. This included provision for religiously aggravated offences in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003. The Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 strengthened statutory aggravations for racial and religiously motivated crimes. The Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012 criminalised behaviour which is threatening, hateful, or otherwise offensive at a regulated football match including offensive singing or chanting. It also criminalised the communication of threats of serious violence and threats intended to incite religious hatred.|$|E
500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik {{was well}} {{received}} by critics, who praised the Chili Peppers for not overpowering the listener with heavy metal guitar riffs as their previous album had. Rolling Stones Tom Moon credited Rick Rubin {{for the change}} in style; Rubin [...] " [...] the Chilis' dynamic." [...] He went on to praise the overall sound, which [...] "displayed a growing curiosity about studio texture and nuance." [...] Steve Huey of AllMusic said the album was [...] "The Red Hot Chili Peppers' best album... John Frusciante's guitar is less overpoweringly noisy, leaving room for differing textures and clearer lines, while the band overall is more focused and less indulgent." [...] He considered Blood Sugar to be [...] "varying... it expands the group's musical and emotional range." [...] Guitar Player magazine credited Frusciante with the Chili Peppers' drastic change in style: [...] "by blending acid-rock, soul-funk, early art-rock, and blues style with a raw, unprocessed Strat-and-Marshall tone, [...] hit on an explosive formula {{that has yet to}} be duplicated." [...] Devon Powters of PopMatters said that [...] "in one funked-out, fucked up, diabolical swoop, Blood Sugar Sex Magik reconfigured my relationship to music, to myself, to my culture and identity, to my race and class." [...] In an article published in The Tampa Tribune, editor Philip Booth praised the record as [...] "an ambitious effort <b>that</b> <b>amounts</b> to a culmination and blossoming of the musical forces that have been brewing in the band's sound since Kiedis and Flea birthed the band in 1983." [...] Robert Christgau gave it an honorable mention in his Village Voice consumer guide, naming [...] "Give It Away" [...] and [...] "Breaking the Girl" [...] as highlights while writing [...] "they've grown up, they've learned to write, they've got a right to be sex mystiks." [...] Chicago Sun-Times critic Michael Corcoran was more reserved in his praise, deeming the record [...] "great" [...] only on occasion while finding the length of the album excessive. Blood Sugar Sex Magik is considered to be an influential album, throughout the nineties, by establishing itself as a fundamental foundation for alternative rock.

Many Chinese Muslim generals like Ma Zhanao, Ma Anliang, Ma Qianling, Dong Fuxiang, Ma Haiyan, and Ma Julung helped the Qing dynasty defeat the rebel Muslims, and were rewarded, and their followers were spared from the genocide. The Han Chinese Qing general Zuo Zongtang even relocated the Han from the suburbs Hezhou when the Muslims there surrendered as a reward so that Hezhou (now Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture) is still heavily Muslim to this day and is the most important city for Hui Muslims in China. The Muslims were granted amnesty and allowed to live as long as they stayed outside the city.
