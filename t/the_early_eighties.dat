Also towards {{the end of his life}} he designed and had made some small sculptures, painted and gilded, resembling some of the standing figures in his drawings. Another idea, surviving in small models, was the creation of the 'aedicola' or 'shelter', a place of refuge or retreat, which had featured in his drawings and paintings.|$|R

25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>eighties,</b> Harley-Davidson {{claimed that}} Japanese {{manufacturers}} were importing motorcycles into the US in such volume as to harm or threaten to harm domestic producers. After {{an investigation by}} the U.S. International Trade Commission, President Reagan imposed in 1983 a 45 percent tariff on imported bikes with engine capacities greater than 700cc. Harley-Davidson subsequently rejected offers of assistance from Japanese motorcycle makers. However, the company did offer to drop the request for the tariff in exchange for loan guarantees from the Japanese.|$|E
25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>eighties,</b> Mitsubishi Motors {{also wanted}} to renew its aging Debonair model, which had not been {{substantially}} updated since its market launch in 1964. Given the existing relationship of sharing technologies and innovations, Mitsubishi accepted Hyundai's request to share a platform, internal configuration, and most importantly, an engine. As Hyundai was an official sponsor of 1988 Seoul Olympics, it used this opportunity to notify all the executives and important people about their new car, the Grandeur. Because of its Mitsubishi basis and good quality, it became very popular in Korea.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} public {{criticism}} of FAO {{for at least}} 30 years. Dissatisfaction with the organisation's performance was among {{the reasons for the}} creation of two new organisations after the World Food Conference in 1974, namely the World Food Council and the International Fund for Agricultural Development; by <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>eighties</b> there was intense rivalry among these organisations. At the same time, the World Food Programme, which started as an experimental 3-year programme under FAO, was growing in size and independence, with the Directors of FAO and WFP struggling for power.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s the {{air force}} started to build road bases after an idea taken from Germany. Built under the BASE 60 {{distributed}} airfield scheme, the bases were ordinary highways constructed {{in such a way}} that they could also serve as landing strips. In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>eighties</b> road number 44 was rebuilt to contain four short runways (17 x 800 metres). Along the road a large number of turn-around-sites for rearming and refueling were built. These short runways are still used today for training, landing and taking off with Gripen and Hercules as preparation for international operations under adverse conditions.|$|E
25|$|Type I IFNs form {{a family}} of several proteins: in humans, there are 13 α subtypes, 1 β subtype, 1 ω subtype and other less studied subtypes (κ and ε). IFNα2 was the first subtype to be {{characterized}} in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>eighties.</b> As a result, IFNα2 was widely used in basic research to elucidate biological activities, structure and mechanism of action of type I IFNs. IFNα2 {{was also the first}} IFN to be produced by the pharmaceutical industry for use as a drug. Thereby, IFNα2 is the best known type I IFN subtype. The properties of IFNα2 are widely shared by the other type I IFNs, although subtle differences exist.|$|E

25|$|The {{film was}} first {{released}} on VHS, Betamax and LaserDisc in 1981 by Magnetic Video, and on RCA CED videodisc in 1982. The transfer to video {{was not considered}} high quality; in particular, the already-cropped theatrical version was again cropped to a 4:3 aspect ratio for television (see pan and scan). The lack of availability has prompted considerable bootlegging of the film, first on VHS and later on DVD, derived from copies of the early 1980s releases. <b>The</b> <b>early</b> <b>eighties</b> also saw the film released on VHS and Betamax in Germany and the Netherlands, these versions were not the same transfer as the USA release, as they {{were based on the}} native 4:3 aspect ratio from the original 16mm negative, thus presenting the film as less cropped than the US releases.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the Hungarian punk {{movement}} go back to <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>eighties,</b> when a handful of bands like ETA, QSS, CPG, and Auróra emerged as angry young men playing fast and raw punk rock music. Like many other musicians of their age, they often criticized the communist government. They {{were a part of}} the national movement to reject the oppressiveness, and particularly the censorship, of the communist regime. As their music {{was on the verge of}} acceptance both by the public and the authorities, concerts were held under tight police control, and often caused moral outrage. With band members often living under constant surveillance, prison was a serious possibility. Two members of the band CPG were found guilty and sent to prison for two years for allegedly unmoral lyrics. After their release, they had to leave Hungary, as did Auróra’s lead singer.|$|E
25|$|Kelly's {{career is}} {{remarkable}} {{in that it}} spanned the eras of several legends of the Tour de France, from Eddy Merckx through to Miguel Indurain. His first Tour {{was also the first}} for Bernard Hinault and the two battled in the sprint of stage 15. Greg LeMond and Laurent Fignon emerged in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>eighties</b> and challenged Kelly in the classics {{as well as in the}} Tour, and Kelly witnessed the rise of Miguel Indurain and the early career of Lance Armstrong. Kelly's career coincided with Stephen Roche as well as classics specialists including Francesco Moser, Claude Criquielion, Moreno Argentin and Eric Vanderaerden. Evidence of Kelly's dominance can be seen from his three victories in the season-long Super Prestige Pernod International competition (predecessor to the World Cup). Kelly competed throughout the season, from Paris–Nice in March to the Giro di Lombardia in October, winning both in 1983 and 1985.|$|E

25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>eighties,</b> An Bord Pleanála finally granted {{permission}} for its wings to be demolished. In 1981, it {{was stripped of}} its wings. These constituted {{seventy percent of the}} house. The essential conditions that called for the restoration {{of the rest of the}} house were subsequently ignored. When the wings were demolished, nothing was done to prop up the remainder of the house. Despite this, the building was still structurally safe. The Corporation had argued that the proposed development was unsuitable for the area. Once Roches had completed their Department Store, the conservationists had no legal leg to stand on, since permission to demolish the house was effective once permission to develop the site had been granted. They became unwilling to negotiate with the conservationists. Roches declared that Frescati was beyond restoration. Marie Avis Walker pointed out that the British Embassy in Merrion Square, which had been gutted by fire, had been restored.|$|E

In 1939, he had an early marriage to the actress Maureen O'Hara; according to O'Hara, it was never consummated, owing to her parents' intervention, and it was annulled. George later met and married Brown's mother, Bettina Iris Mary (Kohr), who was an assistant to Laurence Olivier. Brown's mother was of part Iraqi descent; she recounted, “She was dark and I never knew why.” In her later years, Bettina wrote for an English-language magazine for expatriates in Spain where she and her husband lived in retirement until moving to New York in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>eighties</b> to be with their daughter and grandchildren.|$|E
