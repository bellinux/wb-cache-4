5|$|For {{some twenty}} years, <b>Teller</b> advised Israel on nuclear matters in general, {{and on the}} {{building}} of a hydrogen bomb in particular. In 1952, <b>Teller</b> and Oppenheimer had a long meeting with David Ben-Gurion in Tel Aviv, telling him {{that the best way to}} accumulate plutonium was to burn natural uranium in a nuclear reactor. Starting in 1964, a connection between <b>Teller</b> and Israel was made by the physicist Yuval Ne'eman, who had similar political views. Between 1964 and 1967, <b>Teller</b> visited Israel six times, lecturing at Tel Aviv University, and advising the chiefs of Israel's scientific-security circle as well as prime ministers and cabinet members.|$|E
5|$|Mici {{had been}} a student in Pittsburgh, and wanted {{to return to the}} United States. Her chance came in 1935, when, thanks to George Gamow, <b>Teller</b> was invited to the United States to become a Professor of Physics at George Washington University, where he worked with Gamow until 1941. At George Washington University in 1937, <b>Teller</b> {{predicted}} the Jahn–Teller effect, which distorts molecules in certain situations; this affects the chemical reactions of metals, and in particular the coloration of certain metallic dyes. <b>Teller</b> and Hermann Arthur Jahn analyzed it as a piece of purely mathematical physics. In collaboration with Stephen Brunauer and Paul Hugh Emmett, <b>Teller</b> also made an important contribution to surface physics and chemistry: the so-called Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) isotherm. <b>Teller</b> and Mici became naturalized citizens of the United States on March 6, 1941.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to find out the number of optimum <b>tellers</b> in PT. Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) Inc. Tais Branch Office Kabupaten Seluma. This research is using Multiple Single Phase method to analyzing the optimum number of <b>tellers.</b> The analysis was started by counting the average level of customers attendance per certain time period and the average level of costumers service per certain of time period. This research showed, if the <b>tellers</b> number was adding to 4 personnel, the probability of time for the <b>tellers</b> to sit idle increased from 0, 17 to 0, 22. The average costumer’s waiting time in line is also 5 seconds more faster than if using 3 <b>tellers</b> that spent 23 seconds. But if <b>tellers</b> number was adding to 2 personnel, the average costumer’s waiting time in line become more longer that spent 3 minutes 24 seconds. In case the probability of time for the <b>tellers</b> to sit idle decreased become to 0, 123. This research showed that in certain time the amount of costumers was becoming high, and average costumer’s waiting time in line also was becoming long. For recommendations, Bank Rakyat Indonesia should use 4 <b>tellers</b> in certain time such as in Monday at range time between 09. 00 - 10. 00 and use 3 <b>tellers</b> in usual day...|$|R
5|$|Arthur Compton, the {{chairman}} of the University of Chicago physics department, coordinated the uranium research of Columbia University, Princeton University, the University of Chicago, and the University of California, Berkeley. To remove disagreement and duplication, Compton transferred the scientists to the Metallurgical Laboratory at Chicago. <b>Teller</b> was left behind at first, because while he and Mici were now American citizens, they still had relatives in enemy countries. In early 1943, the Los Alamos laboratory was established in Los Alamos, New Mexico to design an atomic bomb, with Oppenheimer as its director. <b>Teller</b> moved there in March 1943. Apparently, <b>Teller</b> managed to annoy his neighbors there by playing the piano late in the night.|$|E

5|$|In {{the days}} {{before and after the}} first {{demonstration}} of a nuclear weapon, the Trinity test in July 1945, his fellow Hungarian Leo Szilard circulated the Szilard petition, which argued that a demonstration to the Japanese of the new weapon should occur prior to actual use on Japan, and with that hopefully the weapons would never be used on people. In response to Szilard's petition, <b>Teller</b> consulted his friend Robert Oppenheimer. <b>Teller</b> believed that Oppenheimer was a natural leader and could help him with such a formidable political problem. Oppenheimer reassured <b>Teller</b> that the nation's fate should be left to the sensible politicians in Washington. Bolstered by Oppenheimer's influence, he decided to not sign the petition.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the working lives of eight female bank <b>tellers</b> in Fredericton, New Brunswick. It considers three questions: (1) how do <b>tellers</b> define, and relate to, their jobs which {{are subject to}} considerable change and are of doubtful security? (2) how do the bank <b>tellers</b> cope with the daily demands of the job? (3) how do the bank <b>tellers</b> justify their involvement in their work roles, and to what degree do these justifications result in feelings of satisfaction with their jobs? The thesis considers how the bank <b>tellers</b> handle their occupational roles within a job that is undergoing significant change and possible elimination. A Goffmanesque approach focuses upon the role-playing activities of bank <b>tellers</b> in their interactions with clients. Added to the analysis are the effects of technological innovations on the interviewees' work demands. Among the main findings this study found that several <b>tellers</b> drew a comparison between telling {{in the past and}} present. Two distinct views of bank telling also emerged from the sample; bank telling as a profession and bank telling as an insecure, part-time job. Finally, many of the <b>tellers</b> described how bank telling is perceived to be more prestigious than it actually is. The significance of this latter finding arises from the fact that, for those who work as <b>tellers,</b> it is an insecure job characterized by low pay, high targets and on-going training. These findings extend the application of Goffman's approach by pointing out how <b>tellers</b> interpret their performance and thereby deal with role demands that offer {{little in the way of}} job satisfaction nor job security...|$|R

5|$|Strauss, <b>Teller,</b> Borden, and Robb {{would never}} escape the public {{identification}} {{of them with}} the case. In a 1962 television interview, Eric F. Goldman asked <b>Teller</b> whether he favored restoring Oppenheimer's security clearance. <b>Teller</b> was struck dumb, unable to find an answer. The question was deleted from the version that was aired, but the news got out and made headlines. President John F. Kennedy decided that {{the time had come}} to rehabilitate Oppenheimer. <b>Teller</b> nominated Oppenheimer for the 1963 Enrico Fermi Award. The nomination was unanimously approved by the GAC and AEC, and announced on April 5, 1963. On November 22, the White House confirmed that Kennedy would personally present the award, but he was assassinated later that day. The award was presented by President Lyndon B. Johnson instead. Oppenheimer died of cancer on February 18, 1967.|$|E

5|$|When World War II began, <b>Teller</b> {{wanted to}} {{contribute}} to the war effort. On the advice of the well-known Caltech aerodynamicist and fellow Hungarian émigré Theodore von Kármán, <b>Teller</b> collaborated with his friend Hans Bethe in developing a theory of shock-wave propagation. In later years, their explanation of the behavior of the gas behind such a wave proved valuable to scientists who were studying missile re-entry.|$|E
5|$|A special {{group was}} {{established}} under <b>Teller</b> in March 1944 {{to investigate the}} mathematics of an implosion-type nuclear weapon. It too ran into difficulties. Because of {{his interest in the}} Super, <b>Teller</b> did not work as hard on the implosion calculations as Bethe wanted. These too were originally low-priority tasks, but the discovery of spontaneous fission in plutonium by Emilio Segrè's group gave the Super increased importance. In June 1944, at Bethe's request, Oppenheimer moved <b>Teller</b> out of T Division, and placed him in charge of a special group responsible for the Super, reporting directly to Oppenheimer. He was replaced by Rudolf Peierls from the British Mission, who in turn brought in Klaus Fuchs, who was later revealed to be a Soviet spy. Teller's Super group became part of Fermi's F Division when he joined the Los Alamos Laboratory in September 1944. It included Stanislaw Ulam, Jane Roberg, Geoffrey Chew, Harold and Mary Argo, and Maria Goeppert-Mayer.|$|E
5|$|By July 1944, Oppenheimer had {{concluded}} that plutonium {{could not be used}} in a gun design, and opted for implosion. The accelerated effort on an implosion design, codenamed Fat Man, began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion. Two new groups were created at Los Alamos to develop the implosion weapon, X (for explosives) Division headed by Kistiakowsky and G (for gadget) Division under Robert Bacher. Although <b>Teller</b> was head of the T-1 (Implosion and Super) Group, Bethe considered that <b>Teller</b> was spending too much time on the Super, which had been given a low priority by Bethe and Oppenheimer. In June 1944, Oppenheimer created a dedicated Super Group under <b>Teller,</b> who was made directly responsible to Oppenheimer, and Peierls became head of the T-1 (Implosion) Group. In September, Teller's group became the F-1 (Super and General Theory) Group, part of the Enrico Fermi's new F (Fermi) Division.|$|E

40|$|Through stories, <b>tellers</b> {{communicate}} their stance toward {{what they are}} reporting. Story recipients rely on different interactional resources to display alignment with the telling activity and affiliation with the <b>teller's</b> stance. In this article, I examine the communication resources participants to tellings rely on to manage displays of alignment and affiliation during the telling. The primary finding is that whereas vocal continuers simply align with the activity in progress, nods also claim access to the <b>teller's</b> stance toward the events (whether directly or indirectly). In mid-telling, when a recipient nods, she or {{he claims to have}} access to the <b>teller's</b> stance toward the event being reported, which in turn conveys preliminary affiliation with the <b>teller's</b> position and that the story is on track toward preferred uptake at story completion. Thus, the concepts of structural alignment and social affiliation are separate interactional issues and are managed by different response tokens in the mid-telling sequential environment...|$|R
5|$|In 1954, Bethe testified {{on behalf}} of J. Robert Oppenheimer during the Oppenheimer {{security}} hearing. Specifically, Bethe argued that Oppenheimer's stances against developing the hydrogen bomb in the late 1940s had not hindered its actual development, a topic which {{was seen as a}} key motivating factor behind the hearing. Bethe contended that the developments which led to the successful Teller–Ulam design were a matter of serendipity and not a question of manpower or logical development of previously existing ideas. During the hearing, Bethe and his wife also tried hard to convince Edward <b>Teller</b> against testifying. However, <b>Teller</b> did not agree, and his testimony {{played a major role in}} the revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance. While Bethe and <b>Teller</b> had been on very good terms during the prewar years, the conflict between them during the Manhattan Project, and especially during the Oppenheimer episode, permanently marred their relationship.|$|E

5|$|Oppenheimer brought John von Neumann to Los Alamos in September 1943 {{to take a}} {{fresh look}} at implosion. After {{reviewing}} Neddermeyer's studies, and discussing the matter with Edward <b>Teller,</b> von Neumann suggested the use of high explosives in shaped charges to implode a sphere, which he showed could not only result in a faster assembly of fissile material than was possible with the gun method, but which could greatly reduce the amount of material required, because of the resulting higher density. The idea that, under such pressures, the plutonium metal itself would be compressed came from <b>Teller,</b> whose knowledge of how dense metals behaved under heavy pressure was influenced by his pre-war theoretical studies of the Earth's core with George Gamow. The prospect of more-efficient nuclear weapons impressed Oppenheimer, <b>Teller,</b> and Hans Bethe, but they decided that an expert on explosives would be required. Kistiakowsky's name was immediately suggested, and Kistiakowsky was brought into the project as a consultant in October 1943.|$|E
40|$|Pairs of liars and {{pairs of}} truth <b>tellers</b> were interviewed {{and the amount}} of eye contact they made with the {{interviewer}} and each other was coded.

It was hypothesised that this monitoring would manifest itself through more eye contact with the interviewer and less eye contact with each other than in the case of truth <b>tellers.</b> A total of 43 pairs of participants took part in the experiment. Truth <b>tellers</b> had lunch in a nearby restaurant. Liars took some money from a purse, and were asked to pretend that instead of taking the money, they had been to a nearby restaurant together for lunch.

40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} use of pay incentives to drive performance, few studies empirically demonstrate their long-term benefits within work-team settings in field studies; even fewer studies incorporate hybrid pay incentives in their design. This longitudinal field study explored the effects on individual work performance of allocating <b>tellers</b> to teams with supervisors who received hybrid pay incentives, where 60 per cent of their incentive was based on the individual performance of each of their team members and 40 per cent on their own performance. It was conducted on bulk-cash <b>tellers</b> working in 19 centres, using a time-series design. The results, derived from quantitative data collected from 82 individual <b>tellers</b> over 24 months, showed that hybrid pay incentives for supervisors of teams of <b>tellers,</b> some of whom were individually incentivised, were associated with significant increases in the volume, speed and accuracy of deposit processing by all the <b>tellers.</b> The findings empirically demonstrate the long term sustainability of improved performance associated with the introduction of hybrid pay incentive structures within work teams.
