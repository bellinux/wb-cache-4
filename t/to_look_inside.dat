5|$|The {{discovery}} that the comet {{was likely to}} collide with Jupiter caused great excitement within the astronomical community and beyond, as astronomers had never before seen two significant Solar System bodies collide. Intense studies of the comet were undertaken, and as its orbit became more accurately established, {{the possibility of a}} collision became a certainty. The collision would provide a unique opportunity for scientists <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>inside</b> Jupiter's atmosphere, as the collisions were expected to cause eruptions of material from the layers normally hidden beneath the clouds.|$|E
5|$|Wartime Mikkeli is {{identified}} with Marshal Mannerheim, {{the commander of}} the Finnish army and later President of Finland. His personal railway carriage, which he used as a command post during the war, is parked in a siding at Mikkeli station. It is possible <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>inside</b> the carriage through its windows at any time. But public entry to the carriage is only permitted once a year, on Mannerheim's birthday (June 4). The carriage was the venue of Mannerheim's famous 1942 meeting (near Immola) with Hitler, on which occasion a private conversation between the two men was secretly recorded. Photographs of this meeting are on display in the carriage. Mannerheim was a regular diner at the Mikkelin Klubi, where his favourite drink was schnapps.|$|E
5|$|Hank Mitchell and {{his wife}} Sarah live in rural Minnesota. One of the town's few college graduates, Hank works in a feed mill, while his wife is a librarian. When Hank, his older, {{socially}} challenged brother Jacob and Jacob's friend Lou chase a fox into the woods, they stumble upon a crashed airplane. Hank decides <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>inside</b> the plane where he discovers a dead pilot and a bag containing $4.4 million in $100 bills. He suggests turning the money in but is persuaded not to by Jacob and Lou. Hank then proposes that he keep the money safe at his house {{until the end of}} winter. Sheriff Carl Jenkins drives by the area and notices the three men after they hide the money in Jacob's pick-up truck. Jacob mentions hearing a plane in the area to avoid suspicion. After Carl leaves, the three men decide to keep the money a secret, but Hank breaks the pact when he reveals the discovery to Sarah.|$|E

5|$|Ward helps Quatermass and Fowler gain {{entry to}} the plant and they find that Dillon has been {{discharged}} from the infirmary and has left. They then look around and discover that gases are pumped to the giant pressure domes from the pilot plant: ammonia, hydrogen, nitrogen and methane, as opposed to oxygen as in Quatermass' moonbase pressure dome idea. Meanwhile, the guards intimidate and then murder a family who were having a picnic nearby. Back at the plant, Ward slips away <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>inside</b> a dome, and Quatermass and Fowler find him stumbling out of it dying and covered in black slime, which before his death Ward reveals was inside the dome instead of food. Fowler and Quatermass escape back to the Rocket Group and analyse Ward's tie with Leo and Paula, finding that the slime is a corrosive, poisonous substance, fatal to all forms of life on Earth. Meanwhile, the asteroid is approaching its near point.|$|E
25|$|Dark Fall was written, {{designed}} and programmed by Jonathan Boakes, {{who was working}} as a sushi chef at the time. He first got the idea for the game whilst exploring a real abandoned train station and adjoining hotel in Dorset in January 2000. The buildings were sealed shut with corrugated iron, but rusted peepholes allowed him <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>inside</b> and determine they had been quite opulent in their day, and had last been used in the late 1940s. Upon further investigation, he discovered one of the doors of the train station was so rotted, the weight of the iron had pulled it partly off its hinges, {{and he was able to}} get inside and explore the buffet room.|$|E
25|$|In 1917, {{with the}} blessing of the Rt. Rev. John Gardner Murray, bishop of Maryland, Sam Shoemaker went to China to start a branch of the YMCA and teach {{business}} courses at the Princeton-in-China Program. Shoemaker spent several years in China, but attracted few converts until he came {{under the influence of the}} Oxford Group and Frank Buchman. A follower of Dr. Mott as well as leader of Penn State's Y group, Buchman advised Shoemaker <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>inside</b> himself, and to talk about his personal experiences. Buchman also told Shoemaker about the essence of the Sermon on the Mount being four absolutes: honesty, purity, unselfishness and love. After contemplating his own inadequacy compared to those absolutes, Shoemaker decided to let God guide his life. He returned to Princeton in 1919 to head the Philadelphian Society, a campus Christian organization which he had led during his senior year.|$|E

500|$|The feud between The Undertaker and Randy Orton and [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob Orton {{began at}} SummerSlam. At the event, Randy faced off against Undertaker. During the match, [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob (disguised as a fan) {{came into the}} ring and {{interrupted}} the match. Following this, Randy pinned Undertaker after he jumped and pulled Undertaker's head down over his shoulders, a move dubbed the RKO, to win. After the match, Randy peeled off the latex mask of the fan and revealed him to be his father, [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob. On the September 16 episode of SmackDown!, Undertaker defeated Randy. During the match, [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob drove a U-Haul truck down to the ring and unloaded a casket. As Undertaker went to put Randy inside the casket, he opened it and found a mannequin of himself inside. Despite this distraction, Undertaker pinned Randy after he drove Randy's head into the mat in an upside down position, a move called the Tombstone Piledriver. The following week, druids wheeled out a casket. Undertaker appeared on the TitonTron and urged The Ortons <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>inside.</b> The Ortons opened the casket and found mannequins of themselves inside. Undertaker then proclaimed {{that this would be}} their fate at No Mercy.|$|E

Jim and Dwight prove terrible at the job, especially when an upset Kelly (Mindy Kaling) chastises them for forgetting her birthday. They {{try to make it}} up to her by throwing a party but they do a poor job, choosing horrible decorations and forgetting Kelly's age. Dwight reads her file and learns Kelly spent time in juvenile hall, but is disappointed to learn it does not affect her job performance. Meanwhile, Andy (Ed Helms) finds himself attracted to Julia, a female potential client who is talking with Stanley (Leslie David Baker). Andy repeatedly acts awkwardly in front of Julia, and accidentally sets off her car alarm while trying <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>inside</b> and find out what music she likes. Andy admits his attraction to her to Stanley, who then gives the potential client over to Andy in exchange for two of his clients. [...] After walking her out to the car, Andy tries to kiss her, but is immediately rebuked. Andy apologizes and mentions that he just got out of a relationship. The client claims she also just got out of a relationship and Andy starts feeling a connection, but she still rejects him and he loses the account.|$|E

Moore, 119 N.J.L. 215; In re Clee, 119 N.J.L. 310), Brogan's court issued extraordinary rulings in favor of the Democratic machine, in one case asserting that the district superintendent of elections had no authority to open ballot boxes, and in another case ruling that the boxes could be opened, but no one had the right <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>inside.</b> [...] Brogan also assigned himself to the Hudson County jurisdiction, thereby controlling the local grand jury process and squelching other election fraud cases.|$|E
2500|$|Chair of the Annapolis Group, and {{president}} of Gettysburg College, Katherine Haley Will, discussed this decision further in a 9 July 2007 article for The Washington Post. [...] In this article, Hill states that this decision was not based upon [...] "a lack of concern about providing accurate, comprehensive information to help {{students and their families}} make decisions about college." [...] Rather, she argued against the methodology of the U.S. News rankings. In particular, she argues against [...] "the largest single factor in the U.S. News rating formula" [...] which is the reputational survey as, [...] "it is unrealistic to expect academic officials to know enough about hundreds of institutions to fairly evaluate the quality of their programs." [...] Hill then argues that, [...] "by contrast, 1 percent of the U.S. News ratings formula is assigned to student-to-faculty ratios, which many faculty members and students consider {{the most important factor in}} educational experience." [...] Hill states that the members of the Annapolis Group will offer the same information in an alternative, free, format which will not rank schools, as, [...] "an educational experience can't be reduced to one number, a school's so-called rank. The simplicity of a rank is understandably more appealing than spending hours poring over college catalogues and visiting campuses, but myriad complex variables can't be reduced to a single number." [...] Instead, Hill asks students and parents to [...] "compare schools on a variety of factors [...] they should visit campuses and go on what feels like a good match rather than relying on filtered or secondhand information. We must encourage students <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>inside</b> their hearts and trust their instincts when it comes to choosing a college, not whether parents or friends think a university is cool or prestigious." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{makeshift}} {{gas chamber}} {{was set up}} at the butcher shop of the prison. At least one cat {{was used to test}} the lethal effectiveness of the chamber. Gee was to be strapped onto a chair in the chamber, which was eleven feet long, ten feet wide, and eight feet high. A small window next to the wooden chair allowed witnesses <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>inside.</b> Attendees included news reporters, public health officials, and representatives of the U.S. Army. Gee wept as he was placed on the chair until the captain of the guards told him to [...] "Brace up!" [...] At 9:40a.m. on February 8, 1924, the pump sprayed four pounds of hydrocyanic acid into the chamber. The weather was cold and humid. Because an electric heater failed, the chamber was 52 degrees Fahrenheit instead of the ideal 75 degrees, causing some of the acid to form a puddle on the floor. Gee appeared to lose consciousness in about five seconds, with his head continuing to nod up and down for six minutes. He was completely motionless after ten minutes. Some of the witnesses momentarily thought they smelled the odor of almond blossoms, a telltale sign of cyanide, leaking from the chamber. The warden had the witnesses cleared from the area. At about 10 a.m., a vent was opened and a fan was turned on to discharge the poison gas. The prison staff waited for the remaining puddle of hydrocyanic acid to evaporate before cleaning up the chamber. Gee's body was removed from the chamber at 12:20p.m. and taken to the prison hospital. A group of seven doctors pronounced him dead, but did not conduct an autopsy on the body out of concern that some remaining gas could be released. Gee was 29 years old when he died.|$|E
