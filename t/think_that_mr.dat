25|$|It will {{be borne}} {{in mind that}} the Liberal doctrines of that time, with their violent anti-socialist spirit and their strong insistence on the gospel of thrift, self-help, {{settlement}} of wages by the higgling of the market, and non-interference by the State.... I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Gladstone was the strongest anti-socialist that I have ever known among persons who gave any serious thought to social and political questions. It is quite true, as has been often said, that “we are all socialists up to a certain point”; but Mr. Gladstone fixed that point lower, and was more vehement against those who went above it, than any other politician or official of my acquaintance. I remember his speaking indignantly to me of the budget of 1874 as “That socialistic budget of Northcote's,” merely because of the special relief which it gave to the poorer class of income-tax payers. His strong belief in Free Trade was only one of the results of his deep-rooted conviction that the Government's interference with the free action of the individual, whether by taxation or otherwise, should be kept at an irreducible minimum. It is, indeed, not too much to say that his conception of Liberalism was the negation of Socialism.|$|E
500|$|... "Lady Bouvier's Lover" [...] {{was written}} by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and {{directed}} by Wes Archer. The episode {{was inspired by the}} fact that The Simpsons has many elderly characters, which the writers felt was unique for network television, so they sought to highlight those characters. Originally, the episode was supposed to be about Misery. One of the ideas was that Grampa would get injured on Mr. Burns's property and get stuck there, leading Grampa to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns would kill him when he was discovered there. However, this idea was cut out in production because the script was over 85 pages long.|$|E

2500|$|After Lewis became {{chairman}} of the defense appropriations subcommittee in 1999, earmarks in defense bills exploded. [...] "We used to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Lewis would be a champion for smart spending," [...] said Keith Ashdown of the watchdog group [...] [...] "But he brought us the biggest increase in defense earmarking in history." [...] A study by that group found that Lowery's clients have had a remarkable success rate before Lewis' committee. [...] "Hundreds {{of millions of dollars}} have gone to this one firm's clients," [...] says Ashdown.|$|E
2500|$|Interviewed in 2011, {{the father}} {{of one of the}} girls who died said he had thought the trip was simply to the Lagganlia centre and he had no idea {{that they were going to}} be {{climbing}} the mountains. On the Sunday night a policeman had come to the door to say they would be late home – even in Edinburgh there was strong wind and deep snow. Later in the night a newspaper reporter arrived and said the whole party was missing. It was only on Monday afternoon when the parents were gathered at the school that the news came that five children were dead. The father explained that the boy who survived was the smallest child in the party – maybe the others (two women leaders, four girls and one boy) had been huddling round him to protect him from the cold. In 2015 someone who had been a pupil at the school in 1971 wrote [...] "The school was in mourning for some time after that and I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr</b> Chalmers, the headmaster, ever really recovered." ...|$|E
2500|$|Steele's {{comments}} drew criticism, with neoconservative William Kristol {{called for}} Steele's resignation and former George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove calling Steele's comment as [...] "boneheaded." [...] U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican nominee {{for president in}} the 2008 election, withdrew his support from Steele, calling Steele's comments [...] "wildly inaccurate... {{there is no excuse}} for them" [...] and saying [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Steele {{is going to have to}} assess as to whether he can still lead the Republican Party as chairman of the Republican National Committee." [...] Senator Jim DeMint called upon Steele to apologize Senator Lindsey Graham who said [...] "It was an uninformed, unnecessary, unwise, untimely comment. This is not President Obama's war, this is America's war. We need to stand behind the president." [...] Former Vice President Dick Cheney's daughter Elizabeth Cheney has also called for Steele to resign. However, Congressman Ron Paul, who is known for his generally antiwar stance, in support of Steele said [...] "Michael Steele has it right, and Republicans should stick by him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Francis Jeffrey, a Whig {{lawyer and}} editor of the Edinburgh Review, {{originally}} favoured Wordsworth's poetry following the publication of Lyrical Ballads in 1798 but turned against the poet from 1802 onward. In response to Wordsworth's 1807 collection of poetry, Jeffrey contributed an anonymous review to the October 1807 Edinburgh Review that condemned Wordsworth's poetry again. In particular, he declared the ode [...] "beyond all doubt, the most illegible and unintelligible part of the publication. We can pretend to give no analysis or explanation of it;-- our readers must make what they can of the following extracts." [...] After quoting the passage, he argues that he has provided enough information for people to judge if Wordsworth's new school of poetry should be replace the previous system of poetry: [...] "If we were to stop here, we do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr</b> Wordsworth, or his admirers, would have any reason to complain; for what we have now quoted is undeniably the most peculiar and characteristic part of his publication, and must be defended and applauded if the merit or originality of his system is to be seriously maintained. In putting forth his own opinion, Jeffrey explains, [...] "In our own opinion, however, the demerit of that system cannot be fairly appretiated, until it be shown, that the author of the bad verses which we have already extracted, can write good verses when he pleases". Jeffrey later wrote a semi-positive review of the ode, for the 12 April 1808 Edinburgh Review, that praised Wordsworth when he was least Romantic in his poetry. He believed that Wordsworth's greatest weakness was portraying the low aspects of life in a lofty tone.|$|E

[...] "To <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Greystock {{should be}} so mean as to bear malice about {{a thing like that}} wild Indian because he takes his own cousin's part! Of course I'd better go away. You all <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Greystock is an enemy now; but he never can be an enemy to me." ...|$|E

60|$|He was {{beginning}} to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Barry's silence meant compliance. Resignation {{seemed to be a}} part of her marvelous character. And at last she unclasped her hands, pressing them before her eyes. But he heard her gently sobbing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine are {{perfectly}} charming?" [...] said Miss Ruth, as she poured out the tea. [...] "They {{always seem to}} be trying to think of some kind thing to do for other people." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No;--no. I don't <b>think</b> <b>that.</b> <b>Mr.</b> Wharton doesn't {{love him}} a bit better than you do. My cousin thinks him a most {{objectionable}} young man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just <b>that.</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Masters <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Twentyman {{would make}} an {{excellent}} husband. And so do I. There's {{nothing in the world}} against him, and as compared with me he's a rich man. I couldn't give the poor girl any fortune, and he wouldn't want any. But money isn't everything." ...|$|R
50|$|Scudder was {{a feminist}} and suffragette who {{frequently}} marched in parades and demonstrations involved with women's issues.

6000|$|... "They {{begin by}} being very polite to each other," [...] {{continued}} Mr. George; [...] "but by and by, a thousand questions begin to come up, {{and there is}} nobody to decide them. For a time each one professes a great readiness to yield to the other; but before long each begins to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the other assumes {{too much of the}} direction. <b>Mrs.</b> A. <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> B. keeps the carriage too much shut up, or that she always manages to have the best seat; and <b>Mrs.</b> B. <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> A. takes the best room too often at the hotels; or that she is never ready at the proper time; or that she always manages to have what she likes at the hotels, without paying enough regard to the wishes {{of the rest of the}} party." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, I {{believe he}} would. And you've never seen anything, Basil, {{to make you}} really <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Fulkerson didn't {{appreciate}} you to the utmost." ...|$|E

5000|$|Rydberg {{has been}} {{examining}} the noose around Mrs Lovgren's neck and [...] "has {{never seen one}} like it before". He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs</b> Lovgren's last word is accurate, and that the murderers are foreign. But his conclusion leads to several racially-motivated attacks after the information is leaked to the press.|$|R
6000|$|I am {{inclined}} to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Europe has not hesitated {{to put a}} good price upon the art she has sold to Uncle Sam.

6000|$|Mr. Rooper now shifted {{himself a}} little on the bench and crossed one leg over the other. [...] "Now look here, Asaph," [...] he said, with a little more {{animation}} than he had yet shown, [...] "supposin' all you say is true, have you got any reason to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Himes ain't satisfied with things as they are?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure of that, Mr. Slope; I {{am quite}} sure of that;" [...] said the bishop, mollified: [...] "and you really <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Harding {{should have the}} hospital?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Excuse me, gentlemen," [...] he said, [...] "but I do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Cawdor is in. He {{went out}} early this evening, and I {{have not heard}} him return." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, then, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs</b> Ford's {{influence}} {{is the worst}} possible for Ogden. I am sorry for her, {{but that does not}} alter my opinion. It is entirely owing to <b>Mrs</b> Ford <b>that</b> Ogden is what he is. She spoiled him, indulged him in every way, never checked him--till he has become--well, what you yourself called him, repulsive.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to part with you so soon," [...] he returned. [...] "I do hope that we shall meet again some day, and I should be so glad, Miss Affleck, if in future you could <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Chance is not your only friend in the world. Whether we are destined to meet or not again, I should so like you to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I am also your friend." ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the whole}} I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Arbuthnot was wrong. Mrs. Arbuthnot {{and the whole}} Staveley family would have {{regarded}} a mutual attachment between Mr. Graham and Madeline as a great family misfortune. The judge was a considerate father to his children, holding that a father's control should never {{be brought to bear}} unnecessarily. In looking forward to the future prospects of his sons and daughters it was his theory that they should be free to choose their life's companions for themselves. But nevertheless it could not be agreeable to him that his daughter should {{fall in love with a}} man who had nothing, and whose future success at his own profession seemed to be so very doubtful. On the whole I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Arbuthnot was wrong, and that the feeling that did exist in Madeline's bosom might more possibly have died away, had no word been said about it--even by a sister.|$|R
