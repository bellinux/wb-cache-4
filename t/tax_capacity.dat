50|$|Fiscal {{capacity}} {{is the ability}} of the state to extract revenues to provide public goods and carry out other functions of the state, given an administrative, fiscal accounting structure. In economics and political science, fiscal capacity may be referred to as <b>tax</b> <b>capacity,</b> extractive capacity or the power to tax, as taxes are a main source of public revenues. Nonetheless, though tax revenue is essential to fiscal capacity, taxes may not be the government's only source of revenue. Other sources of revenue include foreign aid and natural resources.|$|E

The incentive effects of the transfer programs on provincial tax and spending policies are discussed. In particular, it is shown that equalization grants effectively compensate recipient governments {{for a portion of}} the deadweight loss associated with taxes, and consequently the grants may tend to increase the distortionary tax rates chosen by those governments. This may be the case even when equalization is confined to tax bases which are themselves non-distortionary, such as the taxation of pure economic rents. ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{limiting}} {{factor in determining}} the government budget is the capacity to tax. Per capita income (PCI) is the most often used measure of relative fiscal capacity. [...] But this measure fails to base <b>tax</b> <b>capacity</b> computation on other important tax bases like the sales and property tax and corporate income taxes. A representative tax system should assess the level of personal income, the value of retail sales {{and the value of}} property to compute fiscal capacity. To do so the average tax rate for each base is computed by dividing the total revenue derived by the total value of the base. Thus, as an example, income taxes collected would be divided by total income to yield a rate of taxation.|$|E

This paper attempts to measure the <b>tax</b> <b>capacity</b> and tax effort of 14 major Indian states from 1992 - 92 to 2010 - 11 using Stochastic Frontier Analysis. The use of <b>tax</b> <b>capacity</b> frontier helps to identify those states which are operating near their <b>tax</b> <b>capacity</b> and states which are away from tax frontier.

40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} an {{overview}} of the basics of Japan's local public administration and finance system and to analyze how Japan's municipalities restore their fiscal balance after a fiscal shock. In Japan, local governments {{play a major role in}} redistribution. Combined with regional disparities in <b>tax</b> <b>capacities</b> and an inflexible local tax system, there is a large vertical fiscal gap in Japan between the central and local governments - a gap that necessitates the transfer of funds from central to local governments. Under this system, the fiscal adjustments in Japan's municipalities occur mainly via changes in government investment, and they account for 63 %- 95 % of adjustments in permanent unit innovations in grants and own-source revenue. In contrast to the role of expenditure, the municipalities' own-source revenue plays a limited role in balancing the local budget. The results of this study also reveal that 40 % of the increase in own-source revenue is offset by a reduction in grants. Furthermore, municipalities can induce grants by expanding government current expenditure. Finally, this study offers and discusses some policy implications...|$|R

40|$|As of late, several {{state governments}} in Malaysia have been {{identified}} as having serious difficulty in meeting their financial needs, to the extent of the government being qualified as on the verge of bankruptcy. One of the explanations put forward is that state governments have been acting irresponsibly in managing finances. Thus, the question that ensues is: why do state governments behave in such an irresponsible manner fiscally and financially in the first place? In this paper, we relate the financial difficulties faced by these governments {{within the confines of the}} institutional and political environment currently in place within the country. We will examine one of the institutional features of the intergovernmental system in Malaysia – the intergovernmental grants systems. More precisely, there are two hypotheses that will be tested in this research. First, federal transfers may stimulate more spending by state governments which leads them to increase spending beyond the means available to them. Second, financial problems may be the consequence of a state governments’ incapacity to utilize <b>tax</b> <b>capacities</b> to the fullest, which in turn may be explained by the disincentives effects that are embedded (whether intended or not) within the transfer system...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide a measure of fiscal capacity and fiscal effort of the state governments in Malaysia by using the approach originally proposed by the now defunct U.

The results indicate that state governments differ significantly in terms of their <b>tax</b> <b>capacity,</b> as well as their tax effort. The states of Pahang, Perak and Terengganu are found to have above average land <b>tax</b> <b>capacity.</b> However, these states do not seem to be able to leverage on their capacity as demonstrated by the level attained in relation to the tax effort index. The relationship between tax effort and fiscal position is also examined to determine whether fiscal deficit or surplus is influenced by the level of tax effort exerted.

40|$|The Federal {{gift tax}} {{is one of}} three taxes {{included}} in the U.

The first Federal gift tax was introduced in the Revenue Act of 1924. Congress imposed the 1924 tax after it realized that wealthy Americans could avoid the estate tax, introduced in 1916, by transferring wealth during their lifetimes, called inter vivos giving. Tax-free inter vivos gifts effectively negated the estate <b>tax’s</b> <b>capacity</b> to redistribute wealth accumulated by large estates and removed a source of revenue from the Federal Government’s reach (Johnson and Eller, 1998).
