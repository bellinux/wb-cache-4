5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} {{are found}} in the 5' UTR of messenger RNA, upstream of a protein-coding gene. Here they are able to occlude the ribosome binding site (RBS) and prevent translation of the mRNA into protein. As temperature increases, the hairpin structure can 'melt' and expose the RBS or Shine-Dalgarno sequence to permit binding of the small ribosomal subunit (30S), which then assembles other translation machinery. The start codon, typically found 8 nucleotides downstream of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, signals the beginning of a protein-coding gene which is then translated to a peptide product by the ribosome. In addition to this cis-acting mechanism, a lone example of a <b>trans-acting</b> RNA thermometer has been found in RpoS mRNA where it is thought {{to be involved in the}} starvation response.|$|E
25|$|The minimal <b>trans-acting</b> hammerhead {{ribozyme}} {{sequence that}} is catalytically active {{consists of three}} base-paired stems flanking a central core of 15 conserved (mostly invariant) nucleotides, as shown. The conserved central bases, with few exceptions, are essential for ribozyme’s catalytic activity. Such hammerhead ribozyme constructs exhibit in vitro a turnover rate (kcat) of about 1 molecule/minute and a Km {{on the order of}} 10 nanomolar.|$|E
25|$|All {{steps in}} the {{transcription}} are subject to some degree of regulation. Transcription initiation in particular is the primary level at which gene expression is regulated. Targeting the rate-limiting initial step is the most efficient in terms of energy costs for the cell. Transcription initiation is regulated by cis-acting elements (enhancers, silencers, isolators) within the regulatory regions of the DNA, and sequence-specific <b>trans-acting</b> factors that act as activators or repressors. Gene transcription can also be regulated post-initiation by targeting {{the movement of the}} elongating polymerase.|$|E
25|$|When the pre-mRNA {{has been}} {{transcribed}} from the DNA, it includes several introns and exons. (In nematodes, the mean is 4–5 exons and introns; in the fruit fly Drosophila {{there can be}} more than 100 introns and exons in one transcribed pre-mRNA.) The exons to be retained in the mRNA are determined during the splicing process. The regulation and selection of splice sites are done by <b>trans-acting</b> splicing activator and splicing repressor proteins as well as cis-acting elements within the pre-mRNA itself such as exonic splicing enhancers and exonic splicing silencers.|$|E
25|$|Smaller {{artificial}} {{versions of}} the hairpin ribozyme {{have been developed to}} enable a more detailed experimental analysis of the molecule. This is a commonly used strategy for separating those parts of a self-processing RNA molecule that are essential for the RNA processing reactions from those parts which serve unrelated functions. Through this process, a 50 nucleotide minimal catalytic domain and a 14 nucleotide substrate were identified. Using these artificially derived sequences, a <b>trans-acting</b> ribozyme was developed that can catalyze the cleavage of multiple substrate molecules. This strategy was important in that it allowed investigators to (i) apply biochemical methods for enzymatic analysis, (ii) conduct experiments to identify essential structural elements of the ribozyme-substrate complex, and (iii) develop engineered ribozymes that have been used for biomedical applications, including preventing the replication of pathogenic viruses, and the study of the function of individual genes.|$|E
25|$|In general, the {{determinants}} of splicing work in an inter-dependent manner that depends on context, so that the rules governing how splicing is regulated from a splicing code. The presence of a particular cis-acting RNA sequence element may increase {{the probability that a}} nearby site will be spliced in some cases, but decrease the probability in other cases, depending on context. The context within which regulatory elements act includes cis-acting context that is established by the presence of other RNA sequence features, and <b>trans-acting</b> context that is established by cellular conditions. For example, some cis-acting RNA sequence elements influence splicing only if multiple elements are present in the same region so as to establish context. As another example, a cis-acting element can have opposite effects on splicing, depending on which proteins are expressed in the cell (e.g., neuronal versus non-neuronal PTB). The adaptive significance of splicing silencers and enhancers is attested by studies showing that there is strong selection in human genes against mutations that produce new silencers or disrupt existing enhancers.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two major}} types of cis-acting RNA {{sequence}} elements present in pre-mRNAs and they have corresponding <b>trans-acting</b> RNA-binding proteins. Splicing silencers are sites to which splicing repressor proteins bind, reducing {{the probability that a}} nearby site will be used as a splice junction. These can be located in the intron itself (intronic splicing silencers, ISS) or in a neighboring exon (exonic splicing silencers, ESS). They vary in sequence, {{as well as in the}} types of proteins that bind to them. The majority of splicing repressors are heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) such as hnRNPA1 and polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB). Splicing enhancers are sites to which splicing activator proteins bind, increasing the probability that a nearby site will be used as a splice junction. These also may occur in the intron (intronic splicing enhancers, ISE) or exon (exonic splicing enhancers, ESE). Most of the activator proteins that bind to ISEs and ESEs are members of the SR protein family. Such proteins contain RNA recognition motifs and arginine and serine-rich (RS) domains.|$|E

Although an initial genome-wide association studies (GWAS) study of [...] Crohn’s disease [...] did not identify EFS, EFS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were subsequently linked to Crohn’s disease. SNPs linked to EFS are <b>trans-acting,</b> potentially affecting the level of EFS expression but not its coding sequence.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Trans-acting</b> hammerhead {{constructs}} can be engineered {{such that}} they consist of two RNA strands. The strand that gets cleaved can be supplied in excess, and multiple turnover can be demonstrated and shown to obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics, typical of protein enzyme kinetics. Such constructs are typically employed for in vitro experiments, and the term [...] "hammerhead RNA" [...] has become in practice synonymous with the more frequently used [...] "hammerhead ribozyme".|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} of alternatively spliced mRNAs is regulated {{by a system}} of <b>trans-acting</b> proteins that bind to cis-acting sites on the primary transcript itself. Such proteins include splicing activators that promote the usage of a particular splice site, and splicing repressors that reduce the usage of a particular site. Mechanisms of alternative splicing are highly variable, and new examples are constantly being found, particularly {{through the use of}} high-throughput techniques. Researchers hope to fully elucidate the regulatory systems involved in splicing, so that alternative splicing products from a given gene under particular conditions ("splicing variants") could be predicted by a [...] "splicing code".|$|E
2500|$|VS RNA has {{a unique}} primary, secondary, and {{tertiary}} structure. The secondary structure of the VS ribozyme consists of six helical domains (Figure 1). Stem loop I forms the substrate domain while stem-loop II-VI forms the catalytic domain. When these 2 domains are synthesized in vitro separately, they can perform the self-cleavage reaction by <b>trans-acting</b> The substrate binds into a cleft which is made by two helices.

The A730 loop and A756 nucleotide are critical to its function since they participate in the phosphoric transfer chemistry activity of the ribozyme ...|$|E
2500|$|Splicing is {{regulated}} by <b>trans-acting</b> proteins (repressors and activators) and corresponding cis-acting regulatory sites (silencers and enhancers) on the pre-mRNA. However, {{as part of}} the complexity of alternative splicing, it is noted that the effects of a splicing factor are frequently position-dependent. That is, a splicing factor that serves as a splicing activator when bound to an intronic enhancer element may serve as a repressor when bound to its splicing element {{in the context of an}} exon, and vice versa. The secondary structure of the pre-mRNA transcript also plays a role in regulating splicing, such as by bringing together splicing elements or by masking a sequence that would otherwise serve as a binding element for a splicing factor. Together, these elements form a [...] "splicing code" [...] that governs how splicing will occur under different cellular conditions.|$|E
2500|$|CLIP (Cross-linking and immunoprecipitation) uses UV {{radiation}} to link proteins to RNA {{molecules in}} a tissue during splicing. A <b>trans-acting</b> splicing regulatory protein {{of interest is}} then precipitated using specific antibodies. When the RNA attached to that protein is isolated and cloned, it reveals the target sequences for that protein. Another method for identifying RNA-binding proteins and mapping their binding to pre-mRNA transcripts is [...] "Microarray Evaluation of Genomic Aptamers by shift (MEGAshift)".net This method involves an adaptation of the [...] "Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX)" [...] method together with a microarray-based readout. Use of the MEGAshift method has provided insights into the regulation of alternative splicing by allowing for the identification of sequences in pre-mRNA transcripts surrounding alternatively spliced exons that mediate binding to different splicing factors, such as ASF/SF2 and PTB. This approach has also been used to aid in determining the relationship between RNA secondary structure and the binding of splicing factors.|$|E
2500|$|... of splice isoforms of key {{proteins}} in important cancer pathways. It {{is not always}} clear whether such aberrant patterns of splicing contribute to the cancerous growth, or are merely consequence of cellular abnormalities associated with cancer. Interestingly, for certain types of cancer, like in colorectal and prostate, the number of splicing errors per cancer {{has been shown to}} vary greatly between individual cancers, a phenomenon referred to as transcriptome instability. Transcriptome instability has further been shown to correlate grealty with reduced expression level of splicing factor genes. In fact, there is actually a reduction of alternative splicing in cancerous cells compared to normal ones, and the types of splicing differ; for instance, cancerous cells show higher levels of intron retention than normal cells, but lower levels of exon skipping. Some of the differences in splicing in cancerous cells {{may be due to the}} high frequency of somatic mutations in splicing factor genes, and some may result from changes in phosphorylation of <b>trans-acting</b> splicing factors. Others may be produced by changes in the relative amounts of splicing factors produced; for instance, breast cancer cells have been shown to have increased levels of the splicing factor SF2/ASF. One study found that a relatively small percentage (383 out of over 26000) of alternative splicing variants were significantly higher in frequency in tumor cells than normal cells, suggesting that there is a limited set of genes which, when mis-spliced, contribute to tumor development. It is believed however that the deleterious effects of mis-spliced transcripts are usually safeguarded and eliminated by a cellular posttranscriptional quality control mechanism termed Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay [...]|$|E
5000|$|In {{the context}} of {{transcription}} regulation, a <b>trans-acting</b> element is usually a DNA sequence that contains a gene. This gene codes for a protein (or microRNA or other diffusible molecule) {{that will be used}} in the regulation of another target gene.The <b>trans-acting</b> gene may be on the same chromosome as the target gene, but the activity is via the intermediary protein or RNA that it encodes.
