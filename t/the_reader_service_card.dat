40|$|The „classic tasks“ of {{academic}} libraries comprise acquisition, cataloguing, <b>reader</b> <b>services</b> {{and preservation of}} literature or, more generally speaking, information resources. This has not changed radically in the digital age. What has changed, though, {{is the way the}} tasks are related to each other, perhaps also their respective importance (depending on the library type); but particularly the accentuation of certain aspects of the tasks mentioned above. Visibility and accessibility would hardly have been associated with collection development in the past. Holdings were entered in the catalogue and thus made ‘visible’. Accessibility was taken care of in <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>services</b> department. This has changed significantly in the digital age. The reasons for that are manifold: · With the emergence of the so called ‘hybrid library’ the respective tasks of the central library functions have somewhat shifted and the previously rather clear-cut separations between them have become less rigid. · The innate ‘immateriality’ of digital resources requires a different approach to the topic of visibility and accessibility as early as the actual point of acquisition and in the presentation and ‘documentation’ of collection development. · Last but not least digital access points, next to the catalogue or OPAC including a large variety of different options (e. g. websites), have led to a much quicker and easier way of making holdings and particularly new acquisitions visible than would have been possible in the days of paper or card catalogues. But there are more basic reasons for the new way of dealing with visibility and accessibility. This is certainly due to the characteristics of collection development in the digital age which require us ‘acquisitions people’ to look at the question of visibility and accessibility from a different perspective and regard these as key aspects of the work we do...|$|R

40|$|Division (2000) {{stated that}} {{reference}} service or information service, as differentiated from other library services, is the personal assistance provided {{in pursuit of}} information service, irrespective of its level of intensity; its objective is to provide an end product in terms of information sought by the user. Reference service {{can be considered as}} the “heart ” of <b>the</b> <b>readers</b> <b>services</b> in a library, taking into account that “its performance and effectiveness shape the perception of the entire organization. ” (Quoted in Botts and Bauerschmidt 1999). The traditional reference service is rendered either in person, by telephone and through email. Both the email and the traditional reference “require visible contact point, a link on the library website or reference desk. ” (Quoted in Botts and Bauerschmidt 1999). Nonetheless, they differ from each to a great extent. In the conventional reference interview the librarian may ask one or more neutral questions and rely on the patron’s verbal and non verbal clues to facilitate question negotiation. This type of diagnosis of information needs is an interactive, holistic process during which the librarian’s intuition may be involved. Email reference librarians must, however, rely upon follow-up questions and answers which contain very little, if any, of the non-verbal communication which {{is an essential part of}} the conventional service. With email reference service, the patron may be satisfied with the librarian’s response, or may counter the response with another email message. Unless patrons provide evaluative feedback in the form of another message, the email reference librarian has to rely solely upon personal judgment to evaluate effectiveness of service...|$|R

The study used survey design to determine by means of a one item in a four point likert scale questionnaire, the influence of these variables on reader’s ability to retrieve information. Four (4) hypotheses were tested. Out of the total of 700 library registered undergraduate students, only 698 students and all the 9 librarians answered and returned usable questionnaires. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS} and t-test was used for data analysis. The major findings are that all the four hypotheses tested, rejected the null hypotheses, which means that all these variables influence reader’s ability to retrieve information. This calls for the librarians to improve upon their personal characteristics as well as the provision of relevant information sources if quality reference services are to be attained. Based on these findings, recommendations were made, the major ones of which are the automation and internet connectivity of the reference section of the library, provision of current and relevant information, online access to information sources/e-library and re-training of librarians especially those librarians working in <b>the</b> <b>reader’s</b> <b>services</b> libraries.

As part of that strategy, the library has continued this year to acquire, preserve and make accessible information in whatever format it is available. As a result, some services now being developed by the Library are radically new whilst others have continued unchanged, but common to all is the diverse community of users that remains central to the Library’s mission. Its great collections, built up over hundreds of years, will thus continue to define the reputation of the twenty-first century Library, as digitisation allows these collections can be made available for unprecedented global access and use.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The {{aim of this study}} is to provide a comprehensive examination of university libraries in Greece seen in the European context. To this end, the thesis: i. discusses the context in which Greek university libraries have developed and the challenges they face; ii. examines the factors that affect their operation and development; iii. assesses their role in university education in supporting the informational, educational and research needs of the academic community; iv. compares their position with similar libraries in other member states of the European Union and in Scandinavia; v. suggests actions needed in order that university libraries in Greece should develop further and play their role better. In this study a standard model for university libraries is developed and performance indicators and methodologies which are proper for this model are used. University libraries are examined as open, dynamic, multi-goal seeking and purposeful systems. They consist of resources which are transformed into outputs for the benefit of their users. Inputs, outputs and outcomes can be measured in a greater or less accuracy but measurement itself is meaningful only if it is placed in some kind of context. University libraries operate within a given environment. They receive their inputs from this environment, and their outputs are used by people or other systems in the environment. They are also constrained by factors in this environment such as the social, economic, educational, technological, etc. In this study not only the performance indicators themselves but also the relationships between them that are indicative of performance were analysed. The main findings of the study are related to the environment within which Greek University Libraries operate, the organisational structures, and administrative practices applied, issues concerning staff and the way they affect library development, the provision of library material, the organisation of technical <b>services,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>services</b> that are provided. Library performance is assessed in a number of ways. The indicators produced and comparisons with the state of development of university libraries in other European countries show that Greek University libraries fall behind them in terms of almost all indicators used. It appears that Greek University libraries are weak in meeting the needs of their users in both education and research...|$|R
