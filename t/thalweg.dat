(Since Woodruff Dam was built, this point has been under Lake Seminole.)

A section across a re-entrant and underlying solution canyon shows a rough hour-glass shape. Solution canyons are related genetically to solutional vertical shafts, forming where {{removal of the}} impermeable sandstone caprock permits the vertical descent of water through jointed limestone. Surface runoff concentrates along re-entrant <b>thalwegs</b> where a large quantity of water goes underground.

2500|$|India {{supports}} its stance {{by citing}} the <b>thalweg</b> doctrine in international law. The law states that river boundaries between two states may be, {{if the two}} states agree, divided by the mid-channel. Though Pakistan does not dispute the 1925 map, it maintains that the doctrine is not applicable in this case as it most commonly applies to non-tidal rivers, and Sir Creek is a tidal estuary. [...] India rejects the Pakistani stance by maintaining {{the fact that the}} creek is navigable at high tide and that the <b>thalweg</b> principle is used for some international boundaries in tidal waters, and that fishing trawlers use Sir Creek to go out to sea. [...] Another point of concern for Pakistan is that Sir Creek has changed its course considerably over the years. If the boundary line is demarcated according to the <b>thalweg</b> principle applied to the current channel, Pakistan and India would both lose small amounts of wetlands territory that was historically part of their provinces. [...] More significantly, acceding to India's stance would result in the shifting of the land/sea terminus point several kilometres to the detriment of Pakistan, leading in turn to a loss of several thousand square kilometres of its Exclusive Economic Zone under the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea.|$|E

The border along Klistervatn and Fossevatn was set based on the maps from 1896. At the mouth of Jakobselva the maps from 1896 were of poor quality in combination with the <b>thalweg</b> having shifted since 1896. The <b>thalweg</b> line would create problems for the settlement at Grense Jakobselv, as they no longer would be able to use their harbor or have free access to the sea. The countries therefore agreed on a new line based on a Norwegian proposal, in exchange for the Soviet Union receiving three islets, including Kistholmen and Brennholmen, in the Pasvik River.

40|$|ABSTRACT: To try and {{determine}} the significance ofthinning-upward sequences, two turbidite sections in the Monte Modino Formation (Oligoeene, Northern Apennines, Italy) were studied. The two sections are geographically and stratigraphically several hundred meters apart. One section, consisting of a geometrically definable channel cut into an olistrostrome contains thinning-upward sequences. The second section comprises thinning-upward cycles which alternate with portions of the sequence with no regular changes in bed thicknesses. Comparison of these Oligocene rocks with modern deep-sea deposits and subaerial fans suggests that thinning-upward sequences may form in channels and valleys which need not necessarily be erosional ones. Thus, these sequences may indicate shifts of <b>thalwegs</b> of flows {{as a response to}} partial plugging of depressions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} year-to-year {{changes in}} channel widths and <b>thalwegs</b> of the Brahmaputra and Ganges rivers from 1987 to 1992 using the Landsat images, and {{the characteristics of}} flow and channel behaviors in the Meghna river related to the severe bank erosion occurred in 1988 near the Meghna Bridge site. Channel widening and changes in <b>thalwegs</b> are extremley predominant in the whole downstream reach of the Brahmaputra river, and the maximum increment of width reaches 5 km in the curved stream channel during these five years. On the other hand, the channel shifting and widening are not clear in the Ganges river. The effect of tidal changes on water stages in the downstream reach near the Meghna Bridge site disappears above 4 m in water stage and 4, 000 m^ 3 /sec in discharge at Bairab Bazar. Flow velocity at the section of Meghna Bridge increases for the 2. 5 m - 4 m in water stages, and decreases for the higher stage above 5 m due {{to the effect of}} slow velocity in the overbank flow. Development of a point bar and channel meandering in the upstream reach of the Mehgna Bridge site occurred in 1972 - 1975, and the enlargement of the bar induced severe erosion in the opposite side of river bank. Sediment materials of river bank and channel consist of fine sand with median diameter of grain size, d 50 = 0. 02 - 0. 2 mm, and the profiles of brink are very mild. The results of plane velocity distributions for the three water stages obtained by the 2 -D finite element method support the non-linear characteristics of flow properties observed, and the sections of maximum velocity correspond to ones of extreme bank erosion and bed scour occurred...|$|R

A subparallel stacking pattern of seismic reflectors, similar to that seen between prograding clinoforms in intercanyon areas, is observed between the modern and paleocanyon <b>thalwegs.</b> The concavity of the modern long profile differs from the convex-concave long profile on the middle Pleistocene surface, suggesting a long-term change in canyon sedimentation.

50|$|Internal levees are {{constructional}} features fed by flows that partially spilled out of channelised confinement, but were largely unable {{to escape the}} confinement of the channel-belt. The flows which build internal levees may interact with the main confining surface, i.e., the external levees, and/or the channel-belt erosion surface, and are liable to erosion by the migration or avulsions of channel <b>thalwegs,</b> and the overbank passage of large flows not confined by the internal levees. As a consequence of lateral migration, internal levees may be better preserved on inner bends (Schwarz and Arnott, 2007). Internal levees form only when confinement has been established, {{through the construction of}} external levees and/or the degradation and entrenchment of the composite erosion surface of the channel-belt, or within canyon confinement (Deptuck et al., 2003). Internal levees may form distinct wedges of sediment where enough space is available; where space is limited, i.e., where overspill from underfit channels interacts with external levees or erosional confinement, overspill deposits may appear superficially similar to terrace deposits, which are widely identified in the subsurface (Damuth et al., 1988; Babonneau et al., 2004).|$|R
