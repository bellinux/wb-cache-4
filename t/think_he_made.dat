500|$|The [...] "shy and {{introverted}} folk singer" [...] {{spoke of}} his dislike of live appearances and very little else. [...] "There wasn't any connection whatsoever", Gilbert has said. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> eye contact with me once." [...] Disheartened and convinced he {{would be unable to}} write again, Drake decided to retire from music.

500|$|There was a {{backlash}} in India, which forced Gilchrist to clarify his position. Gilchrist later {{insisted that he}} did not accuse Tendulkar of lying in his testimony. He also denied calling the Indian a [...] "bad sport" [...] in regards to the handshake issue. Tendulkar responded by saying that [...] "those remarks came from someone who doesn't know me enough. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> loose statements...I reminded him that I {{was the first person to}} shake hands after the Sydney defeat." [...] The autobiography also blamed the ICC for allowing Sri Lankan cricketer Muralitharan to bowl; Gilchrist believes that ICC changed the throwing law to legitimise a bowling action that he regards as illegitimate. The law change was described as [...] "a load of horse crap. That's rubbish." [...] Gilchrist claimed that Muralitharan threw the ball and alleged that the ICC protected him because Sri Lankan cricket authorities portrayed any criticism of the bowler's legitimacy as racism and a witchhunt conducted by whites. In response to these comments, former Sri Lankan captain Marvan Atapattu said that by questioning the credentials of players like Muralitharan and Tendulkar, Gilchrist had done no good to his own reputation.|$|E

To {{be sure it}} was no very great favor that I did him; I should have been unworthy the name of teacher, if I had not done it for him, or for any boy in my school. But at any rate, it showed my good wishes for him,--it showed that I was his friend, and what return do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> me for it? Why, to-day he spent his time between schools in filling the room with smoke, that he might torment his companions here, and give me trouble, and anxiety and suffering, when I should come.

60|$|I rather vaguely {{remember}} another anecdote. He {{missed his}} train from Edinburgh to London, and his sole portable property was a return ticket, a meerschaum pipe, and {{a volume of}} Mr. Swinburne's poems. The last he found unmarketable; the pipe, I <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> merchandise of, but somehow his provender for the day's journey consisted in one bath bun, which he could not finish.|$|E

60|$|Lister saw her {{statement}} was significant, and her embarrassment indicated {{that she knew}} it was so. In fact, she had admitted that she knew he would, for her sake, use all his powers. He was moved, but he was not a fool. The girl, wearing her costly furs, looked rich and dignified; he was a working engineer and conscious of his greasy clothes. He loved her, but for a time he must be cautious. To begin with, he would not have her <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> a claim.|$|E

When I see how all the duties of his station worry and perplex Philip, I am glad he was spared from it, and had all his freshness and brightness his whole life. It beams out on me more now, and it was such perfect happiness while I had him here, and {{it is such a}} pleasure and honour to be called by his name; besides, there is baby. Oh! Charlie, I must be happy--I am; do believe it! Indeed, you know I have you and mamma and all too. And, Charlie, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> you all precious to me over again by the way he loved you all, and sent me back, to you especially. Yes, Charlie, you must not fancy I grieve.

60|$|There was {{a pretty}} country {{simplicity}} in this that made some laugh, others looked the more sorry, and Mr. Gebbie fall outright in a passion. I believe {{he knew it was}} his duty (his wife having accepted charge of the girl) to have gone ashore with her and seen her safe; nothing would have induced him to have done so, since it must have involved the loss of his conveyance; and I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> it up to his conscience by the loudness of his voice. At least he broke out upon Captain Sang, raging and saying the thing was a disgrace; that it was mere death to try to leave the ship, and at any event we could not cast down an innocent maid in a boatful of nasty Holland fishers, and leave her to her fate. I was thinking something of the same; took the mate upon one side, arranged with him to send on my chests by track-scoot to an address I had in Leyden, and stood up and signalled to the fishers.|$|E
60|$|When {{the small}} {{sum of money}} which {{he brought with him}} from London came to an end he {{suffered}} from no dismay. He sold no pictures; I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> little attempt to sell any; he set about finding some way to make a bit of money. He told me with grim humour of the time he had spent acting as guide to Cockneys who wanted to see the night side of life in Paris; it was an occupation that appealed to his sardonic temper and somehow or other he had acquired a wide acquaintance with the more disreputable quarters of the city. He told me of the long hours he spent walking about the Boulevard de la Madeleine on the look-out for Englishmen, preferably the worse for liquor, who desired to see things which the law forbade. When in luck he was able to make a tidy sum; but the shabbiness of his clothes at last frightened the sight-seers, and he could not find people adventurous enough to trust themselves to him. Then he happened on a job to translate the advertisements of patent medicines which were sent broadcast to the medical profession in England. During a strike he had been employed as a house-painter.|$|E
5000|$|Jeff Jenkins from Stack Magazine said; [...] "Cadd reclaims {{some songs}} {{originally}} recorded by other artists, including [...] "Love Is Like a Rolling Stone" [...] (The Pointer Sisters), [...] "I Still Canât Believe Itâs True" [...] (Joe Cocker) and [...] "Yesterday Dreams" [...] (Bonnie Tyler), and uncovers some new gems, including the beautifully boisterous [...] "Long Time âTill The First Time"... Bulletproof shows thereâs {{a lot of}} life left in Brian Cadd. In fact, I donât <b>think</b> <b>heâs</b> <b>made</b> a better album; these songs have a spirit that canât be denied.

5000|$|After the season, VÃ¡squez {{participated in}} NBA workouts, where he {{received}} mostly positive feedback from professional scouts. He twice met with coach Gary Williams and his Montrose Christian coach, Stu Vetter, to discuss his future. Three hours before the deadline, VÃ¡squez withdrew his name from the NBA Draft in order to return to Maryland for his senior season. Williams said, [...] "He talked to about 14 or 15 teams and really got a good feel for his situation. I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>made</b> a great move.

6000|$|So I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> a wrong {{impression}} when we {{went into}} the offices of the college. Uncle was still quite excited from his talking. [...] "Let the trustees be brought," [...] he said in a peremptory way to the two young men in black frock coats, secretaries of some sort, I suppose, who received us. Then he turned to me. [...] "Princess," [...] he said, [...] "my diplomas!" [...] He began pulling them out of the bag and throwing them on the table in a wild sort of way. The other people waiting in the room were all staring at him. Then the young men took Uncle by the arm and led him into an inner room and I went out into the corridor and waited. Presently one of the young men came out and told me not to wait, as Uncle had been sent home in a cab. He was very civil and showed me where to go to get the elevated railroad. But while I was waiting I had overheard some of the people talking about Uncle. One said, [...] "That's that same old German that was on board our ship last week in the steerage--has megalomania or something of the sort, they say, and thinks he's the former Emperor: I saw the Kaiser once at a review in Berlin,--not much resemblance, is there?" ...|$|E
60|$|In 1869 I {{was called}} on to decide, in council with my two boys and their mother, what should be their {{destination}} in life. In June of that year the elder, who was then twenty-three, was called to the Bar; and as he {{had gone through the}} regular courses of lecturing tuition and study, it might be supposed that his course was already decided. But, just as he was called, there seemed to be an opening for him in another direction; and this, joined to the terrible uncertainty of the Bar, the terror of which was not in his case lessened by any peculiar forensic aptitudes, induced us to sacrifice dignity in quest of success. Mr. Frederic Chapman, who was then the sole representative of the publishing house known as Messrs. Chapman & Hall, wanted a partner, and my son Henry went into the firm. He remained there three years and a half; but he did not like it, nor do I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> a very good publisher. At any rate he left the business with perhaps more pecuniary success than might have been expected from the short period of his labours, and has since taken himself to literature as a profession. Whether he will work at it so hard as his father, and write as many books, may be doubted.|$|E
60|$|Lawson nodded {{quickly and}} walked away. Philip felt a shiver pass through his heart. He {{had never before}} lost {{a friend of his}} own age, for the death of Cronshaw, a man so much older than himself, had seemed to come in the normal course of things. The news gave him a {{peculiar}} shock. It reminded him of his own mortality, for like everyone else Philip, knowing perfectly that all men must die, had no intimate feeling that the same must apply to himself; and Hayward's death, though he had long ceased to have any warm feeling for him, affected him deeply. He remembered on a sudden all the good talks they had had, and it pained him to think that they would never talk with one another again; he remembered their first meeting and the pleasant months they had spent together in Heidelberg. Philip's heart sank as he thought of the lost years. He walked on mechanically, not noticing where he went, and realised suddenly, with a movement of irritation, that instead of turning down the Haymarket he had sauntered along Shaftesbury Avenue. It bored him to retrace his steps; and besides, with that news, {{he did not want to}} read, he wanted to sit alone and <b>think.</b> <b>He</b> <b>made</b> up his mind to go to the British Museum. Solitude was now his only luxury. Since he had been at Lynn's he had often gone there and sat in front of the groups from the Parthenon; and, not deliberately thinking, had allowed their divine masses to rest his troubled soul. But this afternoon they had nothing to say to him, and after a few minutes, impatiently, he wandered out of the room. There were too many people, provincials with foolish faces, foreigners poring over guide-books; their hideousness besmirched the everlasting masterpieces, their restlessness troubled the god's immortal repose. He went into another room and here there was hardly anyone. Philip sat down wearily. His nerves were on edge. He could not get the people out of his mind. Sometimes at Lynn's they affected him in the same way, and he looked at them file past him with horror; they were so ugly and there was such meanness in their faces, it was terrifying; their features were distorted with paltry desires, and you felt they were strange to any ideas of beauty. They had furtive eyes and weak chins. There was no wickedness in them, but only pettiness and vulgarity. Their humour was a low facetiousness. Sometimes he found himself looking at them to see what animal they resembled (he tried not to, for it quickly became an obsession,) and he saw in them all the sheep or the horse or the fox or the goat. Human beings filled him with disgust.|$|E

Anurag Kashyap, brother of Abhinav Kashyap, tweeted [...] "Salman khan <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> my brother's life.. Hope he {{can do the same}} for his brother Arbaaz with Dabangg 2."
