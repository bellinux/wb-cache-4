5|$|The {{final stage}} {{occurs when a}} massive star begins {{producing}} iron. Since iron nuclei are more <b>tightly</b> bound than any heavier nuclei, any fusion beyond iron does not produce a net release of energy. To a very limited degree such a process proceeds, but it consumes energy. Likewise, since they are more <b>tightly</b> bound than all lighter nuclei, such energy cannot be released by fission.|$|E
5|$|The specificity, in {{the totalitarian}} state, of the {{psychiatric}} paradigm <b>tightly</b> sealed from foreign influences.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tightly</b> rhymed lyrics {{comprise}} a straightforward set of comparisons that border on comic exaggeration.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies {{arise from}} the tips or the lateral {{branches}} or rhizomorphs. New fruit bodies are made of an exterior of thick hyphae {{similar to those found}} in the rhizomorph core; in contrast, the hyphae of the interior originate from the puffball's core. Unlike some other puffball species, the peridium does not differentiate into a distinct exoperidium and endoperidium; rather, the outer layer develops the features of a pseudoparenchyma (a <b>tightly</b> organised tissue where the <b>tightly</b> packed cells resemble plant parenchyma) as the radial and tangential hyphae become interweaved. In time, the peridium dries and falls off in flakes to expose the underlying gleba.|$|E
5|$|Fumigation and {{insecticide}} use: Fumigants and insecticides (e.g., K-Obiol® ULV 6 (Pyrethroid, Bayer, Germany), in France) can be {{used against}} B. rufimanus in storage facilities. Fumigation requires <b>tightly</b> sealed storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|The Mup {{found in}} pigs, named salivary lipocalin (SAL), is {{expressed}} in the salivary gland of males where it <b>tightly</b> binds androstenone and androstenol, both pheromones that cause female pigs to assume a mating stance.|$|E
5|$|The {{epithelial}} cells throughout the respiratory tract secrete epithelial lining fluid (ELF), {{the composition of}} which is <b>tightly</b> regulated and determines how well mucociliary clearance works.|$|E
5|$|The pilot opened full throttle, {{tightened}} the throttle friction nut, pressed {{his head back}} into the head-rest, pressed his right elbow <b>tightly</b> against his hip, and lowered his left hand as a signal to launch.|$|E
5|$|Van der Weyden was preoccupied by {{commissioned}} portraiture {{towards the}} end of his life and was highly regarded by later generations of painters for his penetrating evocations of character. In this work, the woman's humility and reserved demeanour are conveyed through her fragile physique, lowered eyes and <b>tightly</b> grasped fingers. She is slender and depicted according to the Gothic ideal of elongated features, indicated by her narrow shoulders, <b>tightly</b> pinned hair, high forehead and the elaborate frame set by the headdress. It is the only known portrait of a woman accepted as an autograph work by van der Weyden, yet the sitter's name is not recorded and he did not title the work.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} {{community}} of Rockhurst, the route intersects Assembly Point Road, another local road serving a minor peninsula and Assembly Point on its tip. Past this point, NY9L <b>tightly</b> parallels the southern shore of Lake George southwest into the town of Lake George. The route {{comes to an end}} at a junction with US9 and NY9N south of the village of Lake George at the southwestern extent of the lake.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the layers}} of pinacocytes and choanocytes {{resemble}} the epithelia of more complex animals, they are not bound <b>tightly</b> by cell-to-cell connections or a basal lamina (thin fibrous sheet underneath). The flexibility of these layers and re-modeling of the mesohyl by lophocytes allow the animals to adjust their shapes throughout their lives to take maximum advantage of local water currents.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} an enzyme that {{contains}} a cofactor is carbonic anhydrase, which {{is shown in the}} ribbon diagram above with a zinc cofactor bound as part of its active site. These <b>tightly</b> bound ions or molecules are usually found in the active site and are involved in catalysis. For example, flavin and heme cofactors are often involved in redox reactions.|$|E
5|$|Anti-inflammatory {{drugs are}} often used to control the effects of inflammation. Glucocorticoids are the most {{powerful}} of these drugs; however, these drugs can have many undesirable side effects, such as central obesity, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and their use must be <b>tightly</b> controlled. Lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs {{are often used}} in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine.|$|E
5|$|As a result, most geysers form {{in places}} where there is {{volcanic}} rhyolite rock which dissolves in hot water and forms mineral deposits called siliceous sinter, or geyserite, along {{the inside of the}} plumbing systems which are very slender. Over time, these deposits strengthen the channel walls by cementing the rock together <b>tightly,</b> thus enabling the geyser to persist, as mentioned in the previous section.|$|E
5|$|As {{was normal}} in metal type fonts {{of the period}} from Monotype and other companies, the font was drawn {{differently}} at different sizes by modifying Griffo's original single-size design, a quite large letter at an approximate size of 15 points. The changes made were looser spacing, higher x-height (taller lower-case letters) and a more solid colour of impression at smaller sizes, and a finer, more graceful and <b>tightly</b> spaced design at large sizes.|$|E
5|$|Development in Canberra {{has been}} closely {{regulated}} by government, both through planning processes {{and the use}} of crown lease terms that have <b>tightly</b> limited the use of parcels of land. Land in the ACT is held on 99-year crown leases from the national government, although most leases are now administered by the Territory government. There have been persistent calls for constraints on development to be liberalised.|$|E
5|$|Electrons inside {{conducting}} solids, {{which are}} quasi-particles themselves, when <b>tightly</b> confined at temperatures close to absolute zero, behave {{as though they}} had split into three other quasiparticles: spinons, orbitons and holons. The former carries spin and magnetic moment, the next carries its orbital location while the latter electrical charge.|$|E
5|$|Enhanced removal {{tools are}} <b>tightly</b> {{integrated}} for better cleanup of already infected systems. Once triggered, the new, more powerful version of Norton Power Eraser restarts {{the system to}} locate and remove fake antivirus software fake antivirus software and other deeply embedded threats that are otherwise hard to remove. A new tool called Norton Management helps manage different computers and devices equipped with Norton software from a single location.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} population, {{screening}} of large groups is not currently considered effective, although newer techniques, and the screening of <b>tightly</b> targeted groups, are being evaluated. Nevertheless, regular screening with endoscopic ultrasound and MRI/CT imaging {{is recommended for}} those at high risk from inherited genetics.|$|E
5|$|In the off-season, Eugene Melnyk would {{purchase}} {{the club to}} bring financial stability and the team entered the 2003–04 season with high expectations. Head Coach Jacques Martin would guide the team to another good regular season, finishing with 102 points. This was good for only third in the <b>tightly</b> contested Northeast Division, as Boston would have 104 and Toronto 103.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{components}} of the 19S particle have their own regulatory roles. Gankyrin, a recently identified oncoprotein, {{is one of the}} 19S subcomponents that also <b>tightly</b> binds the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK4 and {{plays a key role in}} recognizing ubiquitinated p53, via its affinity for the ubiquitin ligase MDM2. Gankyrin is anti-apoptotic and has been shown to be overexpressed in some tumor cell types such as hepatocellular carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Madlax {{was often}} {{accused of being}} {{secondary}} and reusing Noir stylistic solutions, such as the story premise, the two heroines' appearance, and the musical style. Nevertheless, some sources praised the story for being more monolithic and consequent than its predecessor's, owing to all its episodes and subplots being <b>tightly</b> intertwined and held together by the primary plot.|$|E
5|$|Oganesson is {{a member}} of group 18, the zero-valence elements. The members of this group are usually inert to most common {{chemical}} reactions (for example, combustion) because the outer valence shell is completely filled with eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are <b>tightly</b> bound. It is thought that similarly, oganesson has a closed outer valence shell in which its valence electrons are arranged in a 7s27p6 configuration.|$|E
5|$|Once Egypt {{became a}} Roman province, Roman {{officials}} sought to limit temples' power and independence. Temples {{were made to}} either pay rent to {{the government for the}} land they owned or surrender that land to the state in exchange for a government stipend. Their cults became <b>tightly</b> regulated, less self-supporting, and dependent on government donations and various small sources of revenue.|$|E
5|$|Q'umarkaj is {{the largest}} {{in a group of}} five major sites <b>tightly</b> {{clustered}} in an area of , with the area between the sites showing signs of also having been heavily occupied. Atalaya and Pakaman lie to the east, Pismachi' lies to the south and Chisalin is to the north.|$|E
5|$|Sweet onions have {{a greater}} water and sugar content than cooking onions. This makes them sweeter and milder tasting, but reduces their shelf life. Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated; they have a shelf life of around 1 month. Irrespective of type, any cut pieces of onion are best <b>tightly</b> wrapped, stored away from other produce, and used within two to three days.|$|E
5|$|The Devil's Brood (2008) {{opens with}} the {{conflict}} between Henry II, his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine, and their four sons, which escalates into a decade of warfare and rebellion pitting the sons against {{the father and the}} brothers against each other while Eleanor spends the period imprisoned by Henry. Penman places the characters against a <b>tightly</b> woven tapestry of medieval life, personal conflict, and dramatic characters.|$|E
5|$|The {{book has}} a <b>tightly</b> logical structure, and {{presents}} a bold argument. Illustrations {{are used as}} an integral part of the argument, with numerous detailed charts and one large world map marked in colour showing all reefs known at that time. A brief introduction sets out the aims of the book.|$|E
5|$|The gandingan {{is usually}} played while {{standing}} behind the instrument with the gandingan player holding two wooden mallets. The mallets, called balu, are wrapped <b>tightly</b> with strips of rubber {{at one end and}} are considered lighter and smaller than those balu used for the agung. The rubber ends of the balu are held between the opposing knobs of the gandingan and the player would use them to strike the knobs to achieve a sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary use}} of dental {{implants}} {{is to support}} dental prosthetics. Modern dental implants make use of osseointegration, the biologic process where bone fuses <b>tightly</b> {{to the surface of}} specific materials such as titanium and some ceramics. The integration of implant and bone can support physical loads for decades without failure.|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed <b>tightly</b> {{as if in}} prayer, and {{positioned}} so low in the painting as {{to appear to be}} resting on the frame. They are rendered as <b>tightly</b> compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E
5|$|There are varying classifications of {{oil shales}} {{depending}} on their mineral content, type of kerogen, age, depositional history, and organisms from which they are derived. The age of the oil shale deposits ranges from Cambrian to Tertiary age. Lithologies range from shales to marl and carbonate rocks, all of which form a mixture of <b>tightly</b> bound organic and inorganic materials.|$|E
5|$|Thousands of exoplanets {{have been}} {{identified}} in the last twenty years. The orbits of many of these planets and systems of planets differ significantly from the planets in the Solar System. The exoplanets discovered include hot-Jupiters, warm-Jupiters, super-Earths, and systems of <b>tightly</b> packed inner planets.|$|E
5|$|Today's lecture {{will include}} a {{repetition}} of a demonstration which failed last time. A large dog, stretched on its back on an operation board, is carried into the lecture-room by the demonstrator and the laboratory attendant. Its legs are fixed to the board, its head is firmly held in the usual manner, and it is <b>tightly</b> muzzled.|$|E
5|$|Type II toxin-antitoxin {{systems are}} {{generally}} better-understood than type I. In this system a labile protein antitoxin <b>tightly</b> binds and inhibits {{the activity of}} a stable toxin. The largest family of type II toxin-antitoxin systems is vapBC, which has been found through bioinformatics searches to represent between 37 and 42% of all predicted type II loci.|$|E
