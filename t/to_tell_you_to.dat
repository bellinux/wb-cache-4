2500|$|Verdi had {{received}} a synopsis of the opera from Cammarano, the subject of which was not his. [...] But, as Budden notes, Verdi adopted a somewhat passive attitude, impressed as he was at being {{able to work with}} this librettist. In a letter of 23 February 1845, Verdi had expressed his optimism that [...] "Voltaire's tragedy will become an excellent melodrama," [...] with the added hope that if the librettist would [...] "put some passion into your libretto" [...] and that he, Verdi, would write music to match. In their early correspondence, it appears that Cammarano had already sent some sample verses because Verdi's 23 February letter also contained his enthusiasm for receiving more: [...] "I beg you to send me promptly some more verses. It's not necessary for me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> keep it short. You know the theatre better than I do." [...] It is quite clear that Verdi's characteristic requirement for brevity appeared this early on in his career.|$|E

It was also referenced in the song, [...] "So You Wanna Be a Cop" [...] by the Crack Rocksteady 7, in the lyric: [...] "and after 41 shots, you're grinning in the donut shop". [...] "One Dead Cop", by the related band Left√∂ver Crack, references the incident in the lyric [...] "Bragging how you blasted gunshot 41."

2500|$|Haile Selassie visited Jamaica on 21 April 1966, and {{approximately}} {{one hundred thousand}} Rastafari from all over Jamaica descended on Palisadoes Airport in Kingston, having heard that the man whom they considered to be their messiah was coming to visit them. Spliffs and chalices were openly smoked, causing [...] "a haze of ganja smoke" [...] to drift through the air. Haile Selassie arrived at the airport {{but was unable to}} come down the mobile steps of the airplane, as the crowd rushed the tarmac. He then returned into the plane, disappearing for several more minutes. Finally, Jamaican authorities were obliged to request Ras Mortimer Planno, a well-known Rasta leader, to climb the steps, enter the plane, and negotiate the emperor's descent. Planno re-emerged and announced to the crowd: [...] "The Emperor has instructed me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be calm. Step back and let the Emperor land". This day is widely held by scholars to be a major turning point for the movement, and it is still commemorated by Rastafari as Grounation Day, the anniversary of which is celebrated as the second holiest holiday after 2 November, the emperor's Coronation Day.|$|E
