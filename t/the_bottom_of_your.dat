The idea that sleep had a mentally restorative effect, sorting out and consolidating memories and ideas, was intellectually acceptable {{by the end}} of the 19th century. In ‘Peter and Wendy’, J.M. Barrie wrote [...] ‘It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day. …When you wake in the morning, the naughtinesses and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> mind; and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.’ The stories of Peter Pan take place in a mental world and contain many allusions to aspects of cognitive psychology, some of which predate their formal scientific investigation.|$|E
2500|$|While {{many critics}} still {{consider}} the word [...] "beat" [...] in its literal sense of [...] "tired and beaten down," [...] others, including Kerouac himself promoted the generation more in sense of [...] "beatific" [...] or blissful. Holmes and Kerouac published several articles in popular magazines {{in an attempt}} to explain the movement. [...] In the November 16, 1952 New York Times Sunday Magazine, he wrote a piece exposing the faces of the Beat Generation. [...] "ne day [...] said, 'You know, this is a really beat generation' ... More than mere weariness, it implies the feeling of having been used, of being raw. [...] It involves a sort of nakedness of mind, and ultimately, of soul: [...] a feeling of being reduced to the bedrock of consciousness. [...] In short, it means being undramatically pushed up against the wall of oneself." [...] He distinguishes Beats from the Lost Generation of the 1920s pointing out how the Beats are not lost but how they are searching for answers to all of life's questions. Kerouac's preoccupation with writers like Ernest Hemingway shaped his view of the beat generation. He uses a prose style which he adapted from Hemingway and throughout On the Road he alludes to novels like The Sun Also Rises. [...] "How to live seems much more crucial than why." [...] In many ways, it is a spiritual journey, a quest to find belief, belonging, and meaning in life. [...] Not content with the uniformity promoted by government and consumer culture, the Beats yearned for a deeper, more sensational experience. Holmes expands his attempt to define the generation in a 1958 article in Esquire magazine. This article was able to take more of a look back at the formation of the movement as it was published after On the Road. [...] "It describes the state of mind from which all unessentials have been stripped, leaving it receptive to everything around it, but impatient with trivial obstructions. [...] To be beat is to be at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> personality, looking up." ...|$|E

Although Ferb's taciturnity is generally not commented on in the series, Phineas mentions it while he and his brother were in England on the episode [...] "A Hard Day's Knight": [...] "I'll be the top half since I tend to do more of the talking and you will be on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> part because <b>of</b> <b>your</b> long spindely legs".
