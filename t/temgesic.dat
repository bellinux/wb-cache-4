50|$|One notable {{example of}} drug {{repurposing}} {{is taking the}} partial mu-opioid receptor agonist buprenorphine - which has been prescribed for control of moderate pain for decades in low dosages {{in the form of}} <b>Temgesic</b> 200mcg sublingual tablets, Buprenex 300mcg/mL ampoules - and marketing a high-dosage formulation (Subutex 2 mg and 8 mg) for the interruption and maintenance of heroin and other opioid addictions, which it has proven very beneficial for, with over 200,000 people in the United States alone on buprenorphine maintenance. Some of the reasons for this are that the drug has a ceiling effect - higher doses do not cause further activation of opioid receptors - and a very long half-life in >2 mg dosages. It also has an extremely high binding affinity for opioid receptors, which keeps the drug from being displaced by opioids like Dilaudid, heroin, morphine, and oxycodone, with the result that a user maintained on it can not get high no matter what dosage taken of most opioids. The only opioids that may be able to break through the buprenorphine blockade (which are required in an acute care setting if a buprenorphine patient requires pain relief, as no standard opioids are strong enough) - drugs with similar or higher binding affinities to buprenorphine itself - are the fentanil-class opioids, and the Bentley-series opioids (cf. etorphine, dihydroetorphine), which are rarely primary drugs of abuse and not often found on the streets. Buprenorphine itself is a modified Bentley-series opioid.|$|E

40|$|An {{increased}} {{incidence of}} osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) {{has recently been}} observed in Iran, likely associated {{with the introduction of}} an illegal, steroid-containing opioid drug, <b>Temgesic.</b> The correlation of risk factors associated with the course of ONFH has yet to be determined. Objectives: The {{purpose of the present study}} was to assess the effects of etiologic factors on the course of ONFH after emergence of symptoms. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively assessed patients with untreated ONFH due to one of the four etiologies of steroid medication, <b>Temgesic</b> abuse, trauma and idiopathic. Patients with multiple risk factors and those without collapse at the last follow-up visit were excluded. The effect of age, gender, etiology of osteonecrosis, opium addiction and smoking on the time interval between pain onset and radiologic collapse were investigated. Results: In total, 110 patients (174 hips) were categorized into four etiologic groups. The average time between onset of pain to radiologic collapse in different etiologic groups was 12. 8 months for all groups, 12. 4 months for steroid, 8. 7 months for <b>Temgesic,</b> 18. 5 months for trauma and 16. 6 months for idiopathic groups. Thirteen hips had collapse in less than six months.

40|$|Background: Osteonecrosis {{is common}} after taking <b>Temgesic</b> and Norgesic. This study {{intended}} {{to suggest the}} preferable surgical treatment in osteonecrosis patients who use these drugs. Methods: Twenty tree patients with hip osteonecrosis who were hospitalized in the Kerman hospitals after using <b>Temgesic</b> and Norgesic were followed for about 14 months from 2008 to 2010 (from a minimum of 2 months {{to a maximum of}} 2 years). 65 % of patients underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA) and core decompression was performed for 35 % of them. Patients were compared based on functional scoring of hip before and after surgery. Findings: Duration of drug use was 38 months on average and injection frequency of drug was averagely 3 months. The average functional scoring of hip was 9. 1 before operation and 16 after it (P < 0. 001). Recovery rate of patients in THA was very good and in core decompression was good.

40|$|Sustained-release {{formulations}} of analgesic drugs are promising alternatives to repeated drug injections. Here, we compared a sustained-release formulation of buprenorphine (SB, 2. 2 [*]mg/kg) {{with a standard}} protocol of three injections of buprenorphine (<b>Temgesic,</b> 0. 1 [*]mg/kg/ 8 [*]h) in mice. Buprenorphine serum concentration and analgesic action (thermal sensitivity) were determined in healthy mice. Additionally, the pain relief properties of both protocols were assessed after laparotomy using physiological and ethological measures of pain and recovery. Serum concentrations and thermal sensitivity tests indicated duration of action of at least 4 [*]h (but less than 8 [*]h) with the <b>Temgesic</b> protocol, and 24 - 48 [*]h with SB. Behavioural and clinical parameters indicated at least partial pain relief after surgery for both protocols. Observed side-effects of buprenorphine independent of the protocol were increased activity, disturbed circadian rhythm and several abnormal behaviours. A tendency for decreased food and water intake as well as body weight reduction was also seen. Body weight decreased significantly in animals that received three injections of <b>Temgesic,</b> regardless of whether surgery was performed or not (P[*]=[*] 0. 015; P[*]=[*] 0. 023), hinting at a stress response towards this repeated intervention. In conclusion, an application interval of 8 [*]h (<b>Temgesic)</b> appears too long and might lead to repeated periods with insufficient analgesia in animals undergoing lasting and/or substantial pain after surgery. In comparison to the standard protocol, SB provided a long-lasting, assured analgesia without possible stressful repeated injections in a standard surgical model, with only limited and acceptable behavioural side-effects...|$|E
40|$|Core {{decompression}} (CD) of the femoral head {{is one of}} {{the effective}} treatments of avascular necrosis (AVN), especially {{in the early stages of}} the disease. To investigate further the value of CD in treating the AVN, this study was performed on patients with symptomatic AVN with different etiologies who were treated with CD. This study was carried out on 25 patients (with the total number of 37 femoral head) who were diagnosed AVN using X-Ray and MRI. The CD treatments for these patients were started soon after the diagnosis. The results were considered as a success if there was no progression of disease confirmed by X Ray or no subsequent operation was required. Modified Ficat staging was used to record changes before and 2 years after CD treatment. Twenty five patients were participated in this study in which 68 % (n= 17) were female, 32 % (n= 8) were male, and the average of the age of the patients were 29. 58 ± 4. 58. Eight of these patients had systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) (32 %), 4 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (16 %), 3 with kidney transplant (12 %), 1 Takayasu’s vasculitis (4 %) and 1 Wegner vasculitis (4 %). Eight of patients had a history of intravenous injection of <b>Temgesic</b> (32 %). In patients using <b>Temgesic</b> the changes in Modified Ficat staging were significantly different before and after CD treatment (P= 0. 03) in comparison with other groups. And in all 8 <b>Temgesic</b> users AVN progressed to the stage 3 and 4 after CD treatment. This study demonstrated that CD treatment to prevent the changes in the femoral head has been more effective in patients with collagen vascular diseases and kidney transplant than patients using intravenous <b>Temgesic.</b> These patients, in spite of early operation, showed no benefit of CD to prevent the changes in the femoral head...|$|E

40|$|Background: The illicit vials with {{street name}} <b>Temgesic</b> and Norgesic has been {{distributed}} in black market of Iran in recent years. With reference to their name, one may presume that they contain the opioid Buprenorphine; {{but there are}} some reports in opposition to this. True nature of these vials has been shown in the current study. Methods: All of drugs that had been apprehended by law enforcement police in Arak city in center of Iran during March 2010 to September 2010 were included in the study. Totally 31 samples were analyzed. The samples were examined using thin layer chromatography (TLC) method. Gas chromatography with mass Spectrophotometry (GC-MS) or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were used to confirm the results. Results: All of the samples contained opioids include Heroin, Morphine, Codeine, Mono acetyl morphine and Acetyl codeine with varying proportions. In addition, pheniramine, amitriptyline and caffeine were found in some samples. There was no Buprenorphine in the samples. Presence of the steroid Dexamethasone in the samples was shown too.

The experiments were conducted on C 57 BL/ 6 J mice that were received from Charles River laboratories Germany (Sulzbach, Germany) and homozygous (CSE−/−) mutant mice (C 57 BL/ 6 J. 129 SvEv) bred in-house [6]. Animals were kept under standardized conditions and were equally distributed in terms of age, body weight, and sex (10 – 25  weeks, 26 +/−[*] 3  g, male and female). Native animals were anesthetized with sevoflurane (2.5 %; Sevorane, Abbott, Wiesbaden, HE, Germany) and buprenorphine (1.5  mg/g; <b>Temgesic,</b> Reckitt Benckiser, Slough, UK), mid-line laparotomy was performed, and animals were sacrificed via venous exsanguination.

40|$|The plasma {{concentrations}} {{and clinical}} {{effects of a}} single i. v. dose of buprenorphine 0. 3 or 0. 6 mg were studied in patients recovering from surgery. Analgesic and hormonal effects were greater with the greater dose without a parallel increase in respiratory depression. A comparison with previous work suggests that increased efficacy results either {{from the use of}} the larger dose or equivalently if the first required postoperative dose of 0. 3 mg has been preceded by a similar loading dose. The pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine (<b>Temgesic,</b> Reckitt and Colman), a synthetic narcotic analgesic with agonist and antagonist properties, have recently been described (Bulling-ham et al., 1980, 1981). Results were presented for different routes of administration but only a single dose was used. A trial was designed to study the kinetics of buprenorphine given at two different i. v. doses. Simultaneous measurements were made of the clinical effects. This paper reports the analgesic, metabolic and respiratory effects in this trial.

30|$|All animal {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} compliance with the national legislation on laboratory animals' protection and with the approval of the Ethics Committee for Animal Research (Lund University, Sweden). Two animal models were used in this study, NMRI-Nu with subcutaneous (s.c.) xenografts and SCID mice with intra-tibial xenografts. NMRI-Nu mice (6 -to- 8 -week-old, Taconic; Ry, Denmark) were inoculated in the right flank by s.c. injection of 5 to 8 × 106 cells in a 200 μL of cell suspension of 1 : 1 mixture of medium with Matrigel (BD Biosciences; San Jose, CA, USA). Tumours were allowed to develop for 6 to 8 weeks. SCID mice (6 -to- 8 -week-old male, Charles River; Charles River, NJ, USA) were maintained under isoflurane anaesthesia during surgery. For intra-tibial inoculations, the tibia was punctured using a 23 -gauge needle, and 1 × 105 LNCaP cells were injected into the tibial cavity. The puncture was closed with bone wax, the incision sutured and the animals received a palliative dose of <b>Temgesic</b> (Buprenorphine, RB Pharmaceuticals; Richmond, VA, USA) once daily for 3 days post-surgery. Intra-tibial tumours were allowed to develop for 8 to 10 weeks. Additionally, a group of normal NMRI mice (n = 4) were used to study the distribution of the tracer in healthy animals. Animals were euthanized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection with 20 μL per gram of body weight Ketalar-Rompun solution.

40|$|The {{development}} of a specific and sensitive radioimmunoassay {{for the detection of}} buprenorphine in urine samples is described. With minor adjustments, the assay was also applied to the analysis for buprenorphine in plasma samples. The 2 -diazobenzoic acid derivative of buprenorphine has been prepared as a hapten. The immunization of rabbits with the hapten-bovine serum albumin conjugate resulted in the production of antibodies, which cross-reacted with N-dealkylbuprenorphine up to about the 90 % level. The antibodies showed very low cross-reactivities with the 3 -O-glucuronides and with the structural analogue etorphine. The assay was mainly used to pre-screen for buprenorphine in urine samples of persons suspected of <b>Temgesic</b> misuse and to determine buprenorphine in plasma samples. A linear calibration graph for buprenorphine was obtained after logit-log regression [Y = 0. 383 (s, 0. 059) - 0. 535 X (s, 0. 025); r = 0. 997 (s, 0. 001) ]. The spiking recovery study showed a linear regression of Y(observed) = 0. 94 + 0. 84 X (expected); r = 0. 997. Intra- and inter-assay relative standard deviations were < 4. 35 and < 6. 36 %, respectively. A comparison study of the high-performance liquid chromatographic determination (X) to the radioimmunoassay (Y) resulted in the following regression equation for the urine samples: Y = 1. 44 + 1. 64 X(n = 32; r = 0. 910) and Y = 0. 007 + 1. 58 X (n = 10; r = 0. 930) for plasma specimens.

30|$|All animals {{received}} a Txt and were grouped according to wild type (WT) and CSE−/− with CS exposure. Prior to chest trauma WT and knock-out mice (n =[*] 8 per group) were anesthetized with sevoflurane (2.5 %; Sevorane, Abbott, Wiesbaden, HE, Germany) and buprenorphine (1.5  mg/g; <b>Temgesic,</b> Reckitt Benckiser, Slough, UK), as described previously [31]. Blunt chest trauma was induced {{by a single}} blast wave positioned on {{the middle of the}} thorax, as described previously [32]. Briefly, a Mylar polyester film (Du Pont de Nemur, Bad Homburg, Germany) was rapidly ruptured by compressed air, thereby releasing a single blast wave to the murine mid-sternal chest to reproducibly induce a lung contusion without serious organ damage. Immediately afterwards, CSE−/− mice {{received a}}n administration of GYY 4137 or an equivalent volume of saline as a single intravenous injection of 50  μg/g [33, 34], and all mice received ketamine (120  mg/g; Ketanest-S, Pfizer, New York City, NY), midazolam (1.25  mg/g; Midazolam-ratiopharm, Ratiopharm, Ulm, BW, Germany), and fentanyl (0.25  mg/g; Fentanyl-hameln, Hameln Pharma Plus GmbH, Hameln, NI, Germany), and were placed on a procedure bench incorporating a closed-loop-system for body temperature control [7, 32, 35]. Lung-protective mechanical ventilation using a small animal ventilator (FlexiVent, Scireq, MO, Canada) was performed via a tracheostomy, as described previously [7, 31, 35]. Surgical instrumentation comprised catheters in the jugular vein, the carotid artery, and the bladder [31]. General anesthesia was titrated to guarantee complete tolerance against noxious stimuli and was sustained by continuous intravenous administration of ketamine, midazolam, and fentanyl to reach deep sedation, fluid resuscitation comprised hydroxyethyl starch 6 % (Tetraspan, Braun Medical, Melsungen, HE, Germany) [31]. At the end of the experiment, the animals were exsanguinated and organs were harvested. The heart was cut transversally and was fixed in formalin for immunohistochemistry (IHC).|$|E
30|$|Healthy male C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice, 8 – 12  weeks {{of age and}} {{weighing}} 20 – 25  g, were randomized to either CLP surgery to induce sepsis (n =[*] 23 for moderate severity CLP, n =[*] 17 for severe CLP; n =[*] 3 – 4 per group per experiment) or sham surgery as a non-septic control (n =[*] 18 total, 3 per experiment). These sample sizes were calculated to detect a 30 % or greater difference in survival between CLP groups with 80 % power and α[*]=[*] 0.05. Since the majority of CLP studies are conducted using male mice, female mice {{were not used to}} reduce the total number of mice needed in this study and to control for the potential effects of estrogen on modulating sepsis severity [16]. In accordance with Rittirsch et al. (Nature Protocols, [17]), we used the C 57 Bl/ 6 mouse strain which is most commonly used in CLP sepsis because most genetically manipulated (knockout or transgenic) mice are on this genetic background. Methods for randomization and experimenter blinding were used to reduce allocation, selection, and experimenter biases according to Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines [18]. The CLP model used in these studies was adapted from protocols by others [17, 19, 20], and has been extensively utilized by our group [21 – 23]. Briefly, under isofluorane anesthesia, the abdominal area of the mouse was shaved and sterilized with iodine and 70 % ethanol. All mice underwent laparotomy prior to exteriorization of the cecum onto the sterilized abdominal surface. In CLP mice, 1  cm of the cecum was ligated and punctured through-and-through using a sterile 18 -gauge needle. For the moderate severity of CLP, 0.5  cm of fecal matter was extruded from each puncture hole to ensure patency, whereas 1  cm of fecal matter was extruded from each puncture hole for the severe CLP model, after which the cecum was returned and both layers of the incision were closed with suture. In sham-operated mice, the cecum was exteriorized and returned to the peritoneal cavity without ligation or puncture. Buprenorphine (0.1  mg/kg, <b>Temgesic)</b> and Ringer’s lactate (1  mL) were administered subcutaneously pre-operatively and every 4  h post-operatively for pain relief and fluid resuscitation, respectively. Following surgery, mice were kept 3 /cage together with mice of the same treatment group. Since previous reports show that correction of hypothermia post-CLP surgery affects mortality [24], external heat was provided for all mice through heating blankets placed below half of each cage to allow mice to regulate their own body temperature. Mice were monitored every 4  h until 24  h post-surgery, or until reaching endpoint as characterized by complete inability to ambulate (since death is not acceptable as an endpoint in accordance with CCAC ethics standards). Mice were placed under brief isofluorane anesthesia for body temperature measurements, carried out using a rectal probe thermometer (Harvard Apparatus Homeothermic Monitor, Harvard Apparatus Canada, Saint-Laurent, QC) with a consistent insertion depth of 2  cm.|$|E
40|$|The main aims of {{this study}} were to {{evaluate}} the effect of both a flap and corticotomy procedure on orthodontic tooth movement in rats and to compare the bone changes against a control group. Furthermore, the study aimed to introduce a new design for an appliance, which would allow buccal tooth movement in a rat model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n= 36) aged 6 - 8 weeks were obtained from Laboratory Animal Services (Adelaide University) with ethics approval from The University of Adelaide Animal Ethics Committee (Project number: M- 2009 - 172). There were 3 control groups, each with 6 rats: nil intervention; flap surgery; corticotomy procedure. These formed the baseline comparison to the experimental groups: tooth movement only; flap surgery and tooth movement; and corticotomy with tooth movement; 4 rats were excluded due to anaesthetic death or appliance failure but were replaced with ethics approval from The University of Adelaide Animal Ethics Committee (Project number: M- 2009 - 172 B) such that 6 rats remained in each group. [table omitted] The timeline for the experiment was 7 days with a Calcein bone label injection at 3 days prior to appliance insertion, an Alizarin Red bone label injection at 5 days after appliance insertion, and sacrifice at 7 days after appliance insertion. Throughout the experimental period, Buprenorphine (0. 05 mg/kg. Tradename: <b>Temgesic</b> and comes as 324 µg Buprenorphine Hydrochloride which was then diluted) I. P. was given twice daily for pain relief, in all tooth movement groups. Sacrifice was with Lethabarb Euthanasia Injection (60 mg/mL with 1 mL/Kg of a barbiturate derivative made by Virbac (Australia)). Following this period, the rat maxillae was dissected out and prepared for resin embedding and micro- CT scanning. Micro-CT scanning was performed in a Skyscan 1174 at the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS) with hydroxyapatite standards (250 mg HA/cm³ and 750 mg HA/cm³) to allow for quantitative analysis and comparison between the samples produced. Software for reconstruction was NRecon (v 1. 4. 4, Skyscan, Kontich, Belgium) and for measuring gray levels was CT Analyser (v 1. 8. 05, Skyscan, Kontich, Belgium). Resin embedding (Appendix 1) allows for histological analysis and observation of the bone labels and calculation of the bone mineralisation rates. Impressions using Honigum heavy body (DMG-dental, Gunz Dental, Australia) were taken at appliance insert and again at sacrifice. Honigum is an A-silicone and was used in the automix-cartridge form. These impressions and the dissected rat maxillae were photographed using an Olympus stereomicroscope (SZX 2 -ILLT, Tokyo, Japan) and captured with Analysis Software (v 5. 1 (Build 1276), Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions, GMBH) and measurements from the resultant pictures were performed, using image J (1. 43 u, National Institute of Health, USA). For those rats which required insertion of an appliance, an additional impression was taken at the time of calcein bone label injection so that an individual appliance could be fabricated for each rat. This appliance was inserted 3 days later under deep anaesthesia using Hypnorm/Hypnovel/Water in a 1 : 1 : 2 mix. Hypnorm (0. 315 mg/mL Fentanyl with 10 mg/mL Fluanisone) and Hypnovel (5 mg/mL Midazolam) are mixed separately with sterile water in a 1 : 1 ratio. Once mixed, the resulting solutions are mixed together, on a 1 : 1 basis. All rats were monitored closely until recovery. Following the 7 day experiment and matching each experimental group with its correlated control group; Group 4 (appliance, nil surgery) rats displayed 0. 08 mm greater movement than Group 1 rats, Group 5 (appliance, flap surgery) rats 0. 29 mm greater movement than Group 2 rats, Group 6 (appliance, corticotomy) rats 0. 38 mm greater movement than Group 3. Overall, Group 6 was statistically significant compared to all control rat groups (1, 2 and 3), whilst Group 5 was statistically significant only to Group 2 rats and Group 4 rats were not statistically significant to any other group. However, Group 6 tooth movement was not statistically different to Groups 4 and 5. With regards to bone changes there was no statistically significant difference between the groups and as such, we could not show that a surgical intervention (either flap or corticotomy) could produce significant osteopenia when combined with orthodontic tooth movement over 7 days. There was increased osteopenia when comparing either surgical intervention with nil surgery, but this did not reach statistical significance. This was measured using micro-CT scans with hydroxyapatite standards. As with all experiments, especially those involving biological research, many factors could have affected the outcome. Casual observation of the micro-CT scans would indicate noticeable changes between groups in the osteopenic response by the bone. This would agree with other reports in the literature but our results were not statistically significant. Postexperimental analysis revealed that approximately 66 rats may have given a significant interaction but, in addition, there were issues with appliance failures, lack of pre-treatment micro-CT and other methodological considerations. In conclusion, although greater than average distance changes and demineralisation changes were seen in the corticotomy and flap groups, these did not reach statistical significance. Although we could not prove this definitively, it is likely that this induced osteopenia is the reason for the increase in tooth movement. Further research is required, to provide longer observation periods and to elucidate if the other benefits of a corticotomy procedure, for example, decreased root resorption, are supported with evidence.
