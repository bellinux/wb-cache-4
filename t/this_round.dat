5|$|Bradley Ally was {{the only}} Barbadian swimmer at the Beijing Olympics who competed in {{multiple}} events. Born in Barbados in 1986, Ally {{was involved in the}} Pine Crest Swim Team in Fort Lauderdale, a city in southern Florida. His first appearance at the Olympics was the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, when he represented Barbados in the men's 100meters breaststroke; the men's 200meters breaststroke; the men's 200meters individual medley; and the men's 400meters individual medley. He was 17 years old at the time. Ally returned to the Olympics as a 21-year-old. One of the events to which he returned was the men's 200meters individual medley. During the course of the men's 200meters IM, Ally was placed in the fourth heat of the August 13 preliminary round. He competed against seven other athletes in this heat. Completing the event in 1:58.57, Ally placed third ahead of British swimmer Liam Tancock (1:59.79) and behind Japan's Ken Takakuwa (1:58.51).

5|$|Each {{season of}} the series is played as a nine-episode tournament with six episodes of opening rounds, two semi-finals, and a final. Each opening round starts with three teams of three contestants {{answering}} questions about the Bible. The teams then nominate their strongest contestants to answer questions by themselves without any assistance from their teammates. After {{this part of the}} round, the third-placed team is eliminated and the two highest-scoring teams compete in a final round with the scores being reset to zero. The remaining teams answer as many questions correctly as possible within one minute, and the highest-scoring team from <b>this</b> <b>round</b> wins a $20,000 prize which is given to the team's nominated charity. The winning team then advances to a semi-final game against two other winning teams; the winning team from this game advances to a final game where the grand prize is raised to $100,000. Thus, the team that wins the season-long tournament earns a total of $140,000 for their charity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} round, Cardiff were drawn away against Bolton Wanderers, the reigning FA Cup champions. In {{front of a}} crowd of 49,465 in Bolton, Cardiff won by two goals to nil, with further goals from Ferguson and Davies.

After an initial goalless draw in the following round against Chelsea, Cardiff played them once again at Ninian Park in the replay. Sam Irving put the Welsh team ahead after nine minutes, before Davies made it two on 21 minutes. Chelsea received a penalty, but the shot by Andrew Wilson was saved by Farquharson. Albert Thain scored for Chelsea a minute before half time. Bob Turnbull equalised for Chelsea, four minutes into the second half. A further penalty was given, this time to Cardiff after Harry Wilding handled the ball. This time, Ferguson scored, putting Cardiff ahead once more and winning them the match.|$|E

5|$|Just before Edward's death, Parliament {{introduced}} {{a new form of}} taxation called the poll tax, which was levied at the rate of four pence on every person over the age of 14, with a deduction for married couples. Designed to spread the cost of the war over a broader economic base than previous tax levies, <b>this</b> <b>round</b> of taxation proved extremely unpopular but raised £22,000. The war continued to go badly and, despite raising some money through forced loans, the Crown returned to Parliament in 1379 to request further funds. The Commons were supportive of the young King, but had concerns about the amounts of money being sought and the way this was being spent by the King's counsellors, whom they suspected of corruption. A second poll tax was approved, this time with a sliding scale of taxes against seven different classes of English society, with the upper classes paying more in absolute terms. Widespread evasion proved to be a problem, and the tax only raised £18,600— far short of the £50,000 that had been hoped for.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 2008, the CTA {{board was}} {{scheduled}} to hear the city's plan of a three-phase bailout {{of the construction of}} the rapid transit station under block 37. The plan included $20million in additional tax increment financing. This comes on top of an extra $60–70million in excess of its budgeted amount that the CTA has been forces to expend. The building developer, Joseph Freed & Associates, has agreed to accept $19million of cost overruns. <b>This</b> <b>round</b> of assistance only covers costs that have been incurred to date. No further funds have been committed and the station's development is being halted until such funds arise. The original budget was $213million ($173 from CTA) and costs to date have been $320million. As of last year the costs were $150million over budget and the city is seeking private investment. Construction finally began on the third building, the hotel and residences in the end of 2009.|$|E
5|$|The Uruguay Round of GATT {{multilateral}} {{trade negotiations}} took place from 1986 to 1994, with 123 nations becoming party to agreements achieved throughout the negotiations. Among the achievements were trade liberalization in agricultural goods and textiles, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, and agreements on intellectual property rights issues. The key manifestation of <b>this</b> <b>round</b> was the Marrakech Agreement signed in April 1994, which established the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO is a chartered multilateral trade organization, charged with continuing the GATT mandate to promote trade, govern trade relations, and prevent damaging trade practices or policies. It became operational in January 1995. Compared with its GATT secretariat predecessor, the WTO features an improved mechanism for settling trade disputes since the organization is membership-based and not dependent on consensus as in traditional trade negotiations. This function was designed to address prior weaknesses, whereby parties in dispute would invoke delays, obstruct negotiations, or fall back on weak enforcement. In 1997, WTO members reached an agreement which committed to softer restrictions on commercial financial services, including banking services, securities trading, and insurance services. These commitments entered into force in March 1999, consisting of 70 governments accounting for approximately 95% of worldwide financial services.|$|E

After Batista {{defeated}} Triple H at WrestleMania 21, they continued to fight over the World title at the next Raw pay-per-view, Backlash, which saw Batista retain the title. Following Backlash, a series of Gold Rush Tournament matches to determine a number one contender to face Batista for the World title took place with Kane, Shawn Michaels, Edge, and Chris Benoit winning {{in the first round}} of the tournament. In <b>this</b> <b>round,</b> Benoit forced Triple H to submit to the Sharpshooter, Benoit's submission finisher. On the May 23, 2005 episode of Raw, Batista faced Edge, who had beat out Michaels and Kane for an opportunity at the World title. Batista retained the title after he pinned Edge following a Batista Bomb. Following the match, Triple H attacked Batista with a sledgehammer and challenged him to a Hell in a Cell match. After making the challenge, Triple H performed a Pedigree to Batista on the World title. Batista accepted Triple H's challenge, which led to a contract signing for their scheduled match at Vengeance, which would be for the World Heavyweight title in a Hell in a Cell match at Vengeance.|$|E
5|$|The {{names of}} the first two playoff rounds date back to the postseason format that was first used in 1978, when the league added a second wild-card team to each conference. The {{first round of the playoffs}} is dubbed the wild-card playoffs (or wild-card weekend). In <b>this</b> <b>round,</b> the third-seeded {{division}} winner hosts the sixth seed wild card, and the fourth seed hosts the fifth. There are no restrictions regarding teams from the same division matching up in any round. The 1 and 2 seeds from each conference receive a bye in the first round, which entitles these teams to automatic advancement to the second round, the divisional playoffs, where they face the wild-card weekend survivors. The NFL does not use a fixed bracket playoff system. The number 1 seed will host the worst surviving seed from the first round (seed 4, 5 or 6), while the number 2 seed will play the other team (seed 3, 4 or 5).|$|E
