5|$|Leggetts Creek {{flows through}} a water gap known as Leggetts Gap or The Notch. <b>The</b> <b>gap</b> <b>is</b> {{cut through the}} West or Lackawanna Mountain Range by the creek. There have been some culm banks along the creek and {{historic}} mining operations such as those at the Marvine #6 Colliery have affected it. The creek's headwaters are in wetlands surrounded by residential development. There is riprap on the creek in Leggetts Gap as it flows near major highways in this stretch. It typically has a natural channel in part of its lower reaches {{and there are some}} reaches with gradual slopes. However, {{in some parts of the}} creek's lower reaches, fill has been dumped onto its banks, creating steep slopes. The creek has been channelized in South Abington Township.|$|E

30|$|From Table  5, we {{can observe}} that the {{coefficients}} {{of the interaction}} item are nearly positive, namely the FDI technology spillover to the domestic industrial sector is positive. For the eastern domestic industrial sector, the technology spillover is significant in each technology <b>gap</b> level; when <b>the</b> technology <b>gap</b> <b>is</b> less than 1.254, the technology spillover is 0.150. When <b>the</b> technology <b>gap</b> <b>is</b> between 1.254 and 2.163, the technology spillover decreases to 0.117. When <b>the</b> technology <b>gap</b> exceeds 2.163, <b>the</b> technology spillover decreases to 0.086. Regarding the central domestic industrial sector, the technology spillover is also significant at each technology <b>gap</b> level. When <b>the</b> technology <b>gap</b> <b>is</b> less than 1.516, the technology spillover is 0.163. When <b>the</b> technology <b>gap</b> <b>is</b> between 1.516 and 2.694, the technology spillover decreases to 0.113. When <b>the</b> technology <b>gap</b> <b>is</b> over 2.694, <b>the</b> technology spillover rises to 0.222. Regarding the western domestic industrial sector, when <b>the</b> technology <b>gap</b> <b>is</b> less than 1.635, the technology spillover is 0.124. When <b>the</b> technology <b>gap</b> <b>is</b> between 1.635 and 2.714, the technology spillover is not significant and decreases to 0.075. When <b>the</b> technology <b>gap</b> <b>is</b> over 2.714, <b>the</b> technology spillover is also not significant and decreases to 0.001.|$|R

An inward-leaning fence has also been erected to deter people from jumping.|$|E

25|$|Causes {{parallel}} the evolutionary changes {{occurring in the}} US medical system: payment based on quantity of services delivered, not quality; aging of the population increases the prevalence and complexity of chronic health conditions, {{most of which are}} handled in primary care settings; and increasing emphasis on life-style changes and preventative measures, often poorly covered by health insurance or not at all. In 2004, the median income of specialists in the US was twice that of PCPs, and <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>is</b> widening. Discontent by practicing primary care internists is discouraging trainees from entering primary care; in a 2007 survey of 1,177 graduating US medical students, only 2% planned to enter a general internal medicine career, and lifestyle was emphasized over the higher subspecialty pay in their decision. Primary care practices in the United States increasingly depend on foreign medical graduates to fill depleted ranks.|$|E
25|$|A {{gyratory crusher}} {{is one of}} the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore {{processing}} plant. Gyratory crushers are designated in size either by the gape and mantle diameter or by the size of the receiving opening. Gyratory crushers can be used for primary or secondary crushing. The crushing action is caused by the closing of the gap between the mantle line (movable) mounted on the central vertical spindle and the concave liners (fixed) mounted on the main frame of the crusher. <b>The</b> <b>gap</b> <b>is</b> opened and closed by an eccentric on the bottom of the spindle that causes the central vertical spindle to gyrate. The vertical spindle is free to rotate around its own axis. The crusher illustrated is a short-shaft suspended spindle type, meaning that the main shaft is suspended at the top and that the eccentric is mounted above the gear. The short-shaft design has superseded the long-shaft design in which the eccentric is mounted below the gear.|$|E

500|$|Metis's orbit lies ~1000km {{within the}} main ring of Jupiter.

This material appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of Jupiter's four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from the satellites into space because the satellites' surfaces lie fairly close to the edge of their Roche spheres due to their low density.|$|E
500|$|In Lincoln, {{the river}} flows into Brayford Pool and exits along a narrow channel that passes under the mediaeval High Bridge. The bridge not only restricts {{navigation}} {{due to its}} small size, but the volume of water that can pass through <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>is</b> limited in times of flood. This is alleviated by the Syncil Dyke, which leaves the main channel at Bargate Weir and runs for [...] through the industrial areas {{to the south of}} the main city centre. It used to rejoin the main channel at Stamp End, but was re-routed into the South Delph, a drainage ditch constructed by John Rennie in the early 19thcentury that joins the main channel below Bardney lock. The origins of the Sincil Dyke are unknown, but it is known to have been used as a drainage channel in the mid-13thcentury and is thought to be pre-medieval or even Roman. Parts of it were culverted in 1847 to allow the construction of Lincoln Central railway station.|$|E

500|$|This {{problem of}} {{explaining}} introspective first-person aspects of mental states and consciousness in general {{in terms of}} third-person quantitative neuroscience is called the explanatory gap. There are several different views {{of the nature of}} this gap among contemporary philosophers of mind. David Chalmers and the early Frank Jackson interpret the gap as ontological in nature; that is, they maintain that qualia can never be explained by science because physicalism is false. There are two separate categories involved and one cannot be reduced to the other. An alternative view is taken by philosophers such as Thomas Nagel and Colin McGinn. According to them, <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>is</b> epistemological in nature. For Nagel, science is not yet able to explain subjective experience because it has not yet arrived at the level or kind of knowledge that is required. We are not even able to formulate the problem coherently. For McGinn, on other hand, the problem is one of permanent and inherent biological limitations. We are not able to resolve the explanatory gap because the realm of subjective experiences is cognitively closed to us in the same manner that quantum physics is cognitively closed to elephants. Other philosophers liquidate the gap as purely a semantic problem. This semantic problem, of course, led to the famous [...] "Qualia Question", which is: Does Red cause Redness? ...|$|E
