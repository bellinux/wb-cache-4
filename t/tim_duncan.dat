5|$|Special double-doubles are rare. One such double-double {{is called}} double double-double (also {{referred}} to as 20–20 or Double-20).

The only player in NBA history to record a 40-40 is Wilt Chamberlain, who achieved the feat eight times in his career. Of the five instances, four were recorded in his rookie season, and the fifth was achieved the following year where he recorded 78 points and 43 rebounds in a game. Wilt Chamberlain also holds the record for most career double-doubles (regular season and playoffs) with 1111. <b>Tim</b> <b>Duncan</b> is second with 1005, followed by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar with 1004.|$|E

5|$|After {{some initial}} issues with San Antonio over his contract, Ginóbili re-signed with the Spurs and started every game during the 2004–05 season. This {{was his best}} season yet as he was {{selected}} as a reserve by NBA coaches to the 2005 Western Conference All-Star team, marking his debut in the elite mid-season showcase. During the playoffs, Ginóbili's play was pivotal to winning San Antonio's third championship. The Spurs first defeated Phoenix 4–1 in the Conference Finals, before prevailing in a very defensive oriented seven-game series against the Detroit Pistons. Ginóbili recorded career-highs in his playoff numbers, most notably 20.8 ppg and 5.8 rpg, and had the third highest point total in the entire playoffs. In the NBA Finals MVP Award voting, the shooting guard was a candidate but was edged out by teammate and captain <b>Tim</b> <b>Duncan.</b> The former finished the 2004–05 season as the second leading scorer on the team. During the season, he became only the fourth person to win consecutive Olimpias de Oro, this time sharing the award with soccer star Carlos Tévez.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} 2016–17 season, Parker lost {{longtime}} teammate <b>Tim</b> <b>Duncan</b> to retirement. The Spurs finished {{the season with}} a 61–21 record, as they registered back-to-back 60-win seasons {{for the first time in}} franchise history. Parker played 63 games and averaged 10.1 points per game, his lowest average since his rookie season. In the 2017 playoffs, the Spurs were once again matched with Grizzlies in the first round. San Antonio again defeated Memphis 4–2, with Parker averaging 16.3 points per game in the series. After scoring 18 points in Game 2 of the second round, a win against the Houston Rockets, Parker left the game with a rupture of his left quadriceps tendon that will preclude his return to the playoffs and may miss eight months. Game 3 of the series marked San Antonio's first postseason game without Parker since 2001, which ended an NBA record of 221 straight playoff appearances for Parker.|$|E

5|$|In 2002–03, Parker {{played in}} all 82 regular-season games as San Antonio's {{starting}} point guard {{on a team}} that was largely revamped from previous years. He improved his regular season statistics, averaging 15.5 points per game (ppg), 5.3 assists per game (apg) and 2.6 rebounds per game (rpg). Parker's role as the team's playmaker was reflected in his leading the team in assists on 49 occasions. During the 2003 NBA All-Star Weekend, Parker represented the Sophomores in the Got Milk?

In the post season, the Spurs, led by <b>Tim</b> <b>Duncan,</b> defeated the New Jersey Nets 4–2 in the finals, and Parker earned his first NBA championship ring.
