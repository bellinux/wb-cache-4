It's {{a way for}} me to remain blessedly free of conscience. But for me the beauty of that scene was that we really dared <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> Typically in TV shows we skim over the edges of issues like water spiders, spouting platitudes and spouting unearned 'clarifying' emotions. But there were no violins strumming in 'Black and Blue'." ...|$|E
500|$|Harper has {{expressed}} socially conservative views on some issues. In 1994, he opposed plans by federal Justice Minister Allan Rock to introduce spousal benefits for same-sex couples. Citing the recent {{failure of a}} similar initiative in Ontario, he was quoted as saying, [...] "What I hope they learn is not <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> There are more important social and economic issues, {{not to mention the}} unity question." [...] Harper also spoke against the possibility of the Canadian Human Rights Commission or the Supreme Court changing federal policy in these and other matters.|$|E
500|$|The backless {{evening gown}} that Sévérine is wearing {{when she first}} meets Bond was created from black satin and {{decorated}} {{with a total of}} 60,000 Swarovski crystals. The crystals were applied to tulle in a tattoo design that was directly inspired by prints from Swarovski's Paris atelier; they appear on the [...] "arms, neckline, back and sides" [...] of the garment. The dress took six months to complete. Temime designed it based on Rita Hayworth's black dress from the 1946 film Gilda. Designer Stephen Webster created the jewelry for the outfit by looking to modern Gothic style for inspiration. Marlohe said that she had an influence on the final design of the dress. It took a long time for her <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> with help from the film's crew; she was sewn into one part of it. Despite this, she said she felt comfortable in it. Six different versions of the body of the dress were created to accommodate the filming schedule; Marlohe changed twice a day during the production, and had to be sewn back into the dress each time.|$|E

5000|$|As {{a symbol}} for a forgone era, it has {{inspired}} movies such as Go Trabi Go that presented the Trabi {{as a kind of}} East German character and could make former DDR citizens laugh [...] "not precisely at themselves, but at the absurdities of the system under which they lived until last year." [...] It has also seduced people like the American actor David Hasselhoff to drive a [...] "Trabi", although he had trouble <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> Stephen Kinzer of The New York Times likens the Trabi as {{a symbol for}} the people who built it, who “survived through difficult times and ultimately triumphed”.

500|$|Angelou {{describes}} her writing process as regimented. [...] Beginning with Caged Bird, she {{has used the}} same [...] "writing ritual" [...] for many years. She gets up at {{five in the morning}} and checks into a hotel room, where the staff has been instructed to remove any pictures from the walls. [...] She writes on legal pads while lying on the bed, with a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, Roget's Thesaurus, and the Bible, and leaves by the early afternoon. [...] She averages 10–12 pages of material a day, which she edits down to three or four pages in the evening. [...] Angelou goes through this process to [...] "enchant" [...] herself, and as she said in a 1989 interview with the BBC, to [...] "relive the agony, the anguish, the Sturm und Drang". She places herself back in the time she is writing about, even during traumatic experiences like her rape in Caged Bird, to [...] "tell the human truth" [...] about her life. [...] Angelou has stated that she plays cards to reach that place of enchantment, to access her memories more effectively. She has stated, [...] "It may take an hour <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> but once I'm in it—ha! It's so delicious!" [...] She does not find the process cathartic; rather, she has found relief in [...] "telling the truth".|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Burton {{was due to}} face {{a number}} of challengers in the Republican primary {{including}} McGoff, former U.S. Attorney Susan Brooks, former U.S. Congressman David McIntosh, and attorney Jack Lugar. On the Democratic side, State Representative Scott Reske and labor activist Tony Long entered the race.

In January 2012, Burton abruptly announced his retirement, saying, [...] "I don't want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> it's about personal problems with family health."

2500|$|As {{with all}} Isis releases, the lyrics are almost indecipherable; {{something}} of which Turner is conscious, {{as well as}} its implications. “Even if you are a native speaker it is sometimes impossible to figure the lyrics out properly. I'm conflicted about that from time to time. But then I always think that I'm giving enough with the text that's included, the artwork and the imagery that gives people some clue <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> But leaves it open ended in a certain degree about the intention behind it. [...] While making an album it also is music first for us and lyrics second.” Writing for Decibel, Andrew Bonazelli noted that although only 30 percent of the lyrics were understandable, they were “extremely thoughtful”.|$|E
5000|$|Carmine Pascuzzi {{describes}} the song as being [...] "more serious {{than it might}} appear."

This album represents what I've always wanted to do." [...] She said in another interview, [...] "I rap, I sing, I do my R, I do my slow songs and stuff that the girls will love, I have a down South joint, I have a rock song that I did with my girls–this band called Pretty Boys. [...] It has some funk, some old stuff, it's really fun." [...] She paid tribute to her Filipino culture by incorporating OPM sounds into some of the ballads. While describing the process of working with Leslie, she stated, [...] "I will talk about situations that I was going through at the time and we'll talk about that and it comes straight from the heart that's why it works out well between us," [...] continuing about her songwriting input, [...] "I was just kind of going along with it trying to get the vibe. I'm starting <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> and I'm excited to write." [...] Cassie also mentioned [...] "Not With You" [...] was one of her favorite songs, [...] "It's slow, it's simple, and you get to really hear me as opposed to all the synthesizers and everything in the background," [...] and compared the second single, [...] "Long Way 2 Go," [...] to Vanity 6's vibe.
