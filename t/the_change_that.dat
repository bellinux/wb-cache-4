5|$|The first {{usage of}} the M-66 {{designation}} dates back to around July 1, 1919 {{with the rest of}} the original state highway system. At the time, the highway only extended between Lowell and Lakeview, a route now covered by M-91. The highway has been lengthened in a series of extensions north and south starting in 1925. A rerouting in 1944–45 removed M-66 from its original 1919 routing to replace another highway south of Six Lakes, <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>that</b> spawned M-91. The last big extension in 1965 resulted in the modern trans-peninsular highway route. The last modifications were shorter reroutings in the 1970s.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Sheffield University Paper in May 1965, Dylan explained <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>that</b> had occurred in his songwriting over the previous twelve months, noting [...] "The big difference is that the songs I was writing last year ... they were what I call one-dimensional songs, but my new songs I'm trying to make more three-dimensional, you know, there's more symbolism, they're written on more than one level." [...] In late 1965, Dylan commented on the writing of [...] "My Back Pages" [...] specifically during {{an interview}} with Margaret Steen for The Toronto Star: [...] "I was in my New York phase then, or at least, I was just coming out of it. I was still keeping the things that are really really real out of my songs, for fear they'd be misunderstood. Now I don't care if they are." [...] As Dylan stated to Nat Hentoff at the time that [...] "My Back Pages" [...] and the other songs on Another Side of Bob Dylan were written, [...] "There aren't any finger pointing songs ... Now {{a lot of people are}} doing finger pointing songs. [...] You know, pointing to all the things that are wrong. [...] Me, I don't want to write for people anymore.

500|$|The {{allusions to}} {{politics}} throughout the narrative {{are supposed to}} represent the darker undertones surrounding {{the foundations of the}} American Dream. In addition, the game itself exhibits qualities relating to the movement from a [...] "violent freedom" [...] to a situation of [...] "overt state control", told through a story of innocence and freedom. Vice President for Creativity Dan Houser made parallels with this representation, and the more recent predicament of the modern society of America. Houser also expressed the difficulty in balancing the game's narrative to avoid feeling both [...] "camp" [...] and [...] "pompous"; he explained that balancing the two while maintaining realism was where the difficulty spawned. With the story, Houser felt that it does not fully represent the racial attitudes commonly associated with the game's era. He stated that this was a choice made by the designers due to the unpleasantness of the attitudes. [...] "he language people use to describe other races is insanely offensive to modern ears and we hint at that but we maybe don't do it with quite the vibrancy that people use in some of our research," [...] he explained. The team focused more on the combination of old and modern America, and <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>that</b> was experienced during this period. In terms of the violence depicted throughout the game, Houser spoke about the team's need for it to feel [...] "slightly raw and unpleasant"; they tried to achieve realism without exaggerating. The team were hoping for players to display an [...] "emotional response" [...] from the game, and for them to feel immersed in the game world and time period.|$|E

2500|$|In Plato one {{experienced}} unit is a state, or object existing, {{which can}} be observed. The time parameter is set at [...] "ever"; that is, the state is to be presumed present between observations. Change is to be deduced by comparing observations and is thus presumed a function that happens to objects already in being, rather than something ontologically essential to them (such that something that does not change cannot exist) as in Heraclitus. In Plato, {{no matter how many}} of those experienced units you are able to tally, you cannot get through the mysterious gap between them to account for <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>that</b> must be occurring there. This limitation is considered a fundamental limitation of reality by Plato and in part underpins his differentiation between imperfect experience from more perfect Forms. The fact that this is no limitation for Heraclitus motivates Plato's condemnation.|$|E
