All industrial processes are based on neutral or acid pH values because although alkali treatments speed up conversion, they also promote degradation processes. Acidic extraction conditions are extensively used in the industry, but the degree of acid varies with different processes. This extraction step is a multistage process, and the extraction temperature usually is increased in later extraction steps, which ensures minimum <b>thermal</b> <b>degradation</b> of the extracted gelatin.|$|E

2500|$|DSC is used widely for {{examining}} polymeric materials {{to determine their}} thermal transitions. [...] The observed thermal transitions can be utilized to compare materials, although the transitions do not uniquely identify composition. The composition of unknown materials may be completed using complementary techniques such as IR spectroscopy. [...] Melting points and glass transition temperatures for most polymers are available from standard compilations, and the method can show polymer degradation by the lowering of the expected melting point, Tm, for example. Tm depends on the molecular weight of the polymer and thermal history, so lower grades may have lower melting points than expected. The percent crystalline content of a polymer can be estimated from the crystallization/melting peaks of the DSC graph as reference heats of fusion {{can be found in}} the literature. DSC can also be used to study <b>thermal</b> <b>degradation</b> of polymers using an approach such as Oxidative Onset Temperature/Time (OOT), however, the user risks contamination of the DSC cell, which can be problematic.

[...] In addition, examination of minor events in first heat thermal analysis data can be useful as these apparently [...] "anomalous peaks" [...] can in fact also be representative of process or storage thermal history of the material or polymer physical aging. Comparison of first and second heat data collected at consistent heating rates can allow the analyst to learn about both polymer processing history and material properties.|$|E

At high temperatures the components of the long chain backbone of the polymer can begin to be broken (chain scission) and react with one another to change the properties of the polymer. <b>Thermal</b> <b>degradation</b> can present an upper limit to the service temperature of plastics as much as the possibility of mechanical property loss. Indeed unless correctly prevented, significant <b>thermal</b> <b>degradation</b> can occur at temperatures much lower than those at which mechanical failure is likely to occur. The chemical reactions involved in <b>thermal</b> <b>degradation</b> lead to physical and optical property changes relative to the initially specified properties. <b>Thermal</b> <b>degradation</b> generally involves changes to the molecular weight (and molecular weight distribution) of the polymer and typical property changes include reduced ductility and embrittlement, chalking, color changes, cracking, general reduction in most other desirable physical properties. Thermal breakdown products may include a complex mixture of compounds, including but not limited to carbon monoxide, ammonia, aliphatic amines, ketones, nitriles, and hydrogen cyanide, which may be flammable, toxic and/or irritating.
