Alberto produced a storm tide of 8.53feet (2.6m) at Fort Pulaski National Monument, causing some beach erosion along the coastline.|$|E
5|$|GTRI's {{research}} spans {{a variety}} of disciplines, including national defense, homeland security, public health, education, mobile and wireless technologies, and economic development. Major customers for GTRI research include United States Department of Defense agencies, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Georgia,</b> non-defense federal agencies, and private industry. Overall, contracts and grants from Department of Defense agencies account for approximately 84% of GTRI's total research funding. Since it was established, GTRI has expanded its engineering focus to include science, economics, policy, and other areas that leverage GTRI's partnership with Georgia Tech. GTRI researchers are named on 76 active patents and 43 pending patents.|$|E
5|$|Joseph M. Pettit became {{president}} of the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1972.

Pettit has also received credit for shifting Georgia Tech back to its roots with regards to providing assistance with economic development within <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Georgia.</b> In the decades known for the Vietnam War and the launch of Sputnik, research at Georgia Tech and the Georgia Tech Research Institute had become so tied with NASA and the Department of Defense that local industrial development had been largely forgotten.|$|E

5|$|All Saints' parish {{church was}} rebuilt in 1873 {{and is a}} grade II listed building.

There are two community associations that are both registered charities. The Cranham Community Association operates a broad range of sporting, self-improvement and hobby activities at Cranham Community Centre on Marlborough Gardens. Cranham Social Hall, with a capacity of 100, is separately operated by the Front Lane Community Association, and provides a limited range of activities. The main cultural and entertainment facilities of the borough are located in Hornchurch and Romford.|$|E
5|$|By 1938, the Engineering Experiment Station was {{producing}} useful technology, and the station needed {{a method to}} conduct contract work outside the state budget. Consequently, the Industrial Development Council (IDC) was formed. The IDC was created as a non-profit contract organization for the EES, which allowed the EES to receive federal contracts while still retaining its relationship with Georgia Tech and <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Georgia.</b> It {{was created by the}} Chancellor of the University System and the president of Georgia Power Company, and the Engineering Experiment Station's director {{was a member of the}} council. The IDC later became the Georgia Tech Research Corporation, which currently serves as the sole contract organization for all Georgia Tech faculty and departments. In addition, the contract organization manages the intellectual property that results from research.|$|E
5|$|Evans' {{service as}} Imperial Wizard {{proved to be}} a lucrative position, {{allowing}} him to maintain a large residence in a prestigious Atlanta neighborhood. In the mid-1930s, however, Klan funds dwindled, and he worked for a Georgia-based construction company selling products to the Georgia Highway Board. At the same time, he was a staunch supporter of Georgia governor Eurith D. Rivers, whom he had previously employed as a lecturer. Owing to the political support that he provided the administration, Evans was allowed to sell to the highway board without bidding against other contractors. In 1940, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Georgia</b> charged Evans {{and a member of the}} state highway board with price fixing. The Attorney General of Georgia, Ellis Arnall, directed legal proceedings against Evans that resulted in a $15,000 fine.|$|E

5|$|In the end, {{there were}} 56 tornadoes {{confirmed}} during the outbreak, including three EF3 tornadoes reported across three states, {{as well as}} three EF4 tornadoes; two in Alabama and one in Kansas, the first such tornadoes since {{the introduction of the}} Enhanced Fujita Scale. Total damages were estimated at over $580million from tornadoes alone, making it the fourth-costliest tornado outbreak in US history (the figure not including damage from other thunderstorm impacts including hail and straight-line winds). Insured losses in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Georgia</b> topped $210million, making this outbreak the costliest in that state's history. Enterprise, Alabama, which was hit the hardest, sustained damages in excess of $307million.|$|E
5|$|One of Robinson's professors, James E. Boyd, {{convinced}} him {{to give up the}} radio repair business and work as a research assistant at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (then known as the Engineering Experiment Station, or EES). One of his ham radio friends was actually his boss's boss and EES director, Gerald Rosselot. Working after hours at EES, Robinson built a television set in the lab, which he and others claim was the first to be built in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Georgia.</b> In 1950, Robinson went to Tennessee to work in nuclear engineering for Oak Ridge National Laboratory, servicing radiology-related equipment at local hospitals.|$|E
5|$|The EES had sizable {{and growing}} support from <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Georgia</b> and its Industrial Development Council, which {{developed}} products and methods and provided technical assistance for Georgia industry. However, {{due in part}} to efforts made by Boyd and previous station director Gerald Rosselot, the station increasingly relied on electronics research funding from the federal government. In 1971, funding to both Georgia Tech's academic units and the EES began to suffer due to a sharp decline in state funds combined with cuts to federal science, research, and education funding {{after the end of the}} Space Race funding boom. Similar institutions, such as the Battelle Memorial Institute, Stanford Research Institute, and the Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute had weathered this storm by becoming exceedingly good at obtaining research contracts.|$|E
