500|$|The world's oldest {{illustrated}} {{depiction of}} an endless power-transmitting chain drive is from Su Song's horological treatise. It {{was used in}} the clockworks for coupling the main drive shaft to the armillary sphere gearbox (rotating three small pinions), as seen in Needham's Fig. 410 and Fig. 652. This belonged to the uppermost end of the main vertical transmission shaft, incorporating right angle gears and oblique gears connected by a short idling shaft. The <b>toothed</b> <b>ring</b> gear called the diurnal motion gear ring [...] was fit around the shell of the armillary sphere along the declination parallel near the southern pole. Although the ancient Greek Philo of Byzantium (3rd century BC) featured a sort of endless belt for his magazine arcuballista, which did not transmit continuous power, the influential source for Su Song's chain drive is most likely the continuously-driven chain pump known in China since the Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD).

50|$|A {{wheel speed}} sensor or vehicle speed sensor (VSS) {{is a type of}} tachometer. It is a sender device used for reading the speed of a vehicle's wheel rotation. It usually {{consists}} of a <b>toothed</b> <b>ring</b> and pickup.|$|E
5000|$|Toothed {{wheel feed}} system: An outer <b>toothed</b> <b>ring</b> is driven, {{rotating}} an inner toothed wheel with it. The toothed wheels form cell segments {{as they move}} against each other. The cell content is transported through the toothing and it is then voided and ejected in the outlet area.|$|E

50|$|Larger water wheels (usually {{overshot}} steel wheels) {{transmit the}} power from a <b>toothed</b> annular <b>ring</b> that is mounted near {{the outer edge}} of the wheel. This drives the machinery using a spur gear mounted on a shaft rather than taking power from the central axle. However, the basic mode of operation remains the same; gravity drives machinery through the motion of flowing water.|$|R
40|$|Wrench {{converts}} gripping {{action of}} hand to rotary motion without imparting reactive moments or forces on part being turned or on operator. Wrench should {{be useful in}} undersea operations and other delicate work where reactive forces and torques have to be controlled. In design for valve tightening, tool resembles cross between conventional spanner wrench and pilers. One handle engages valve body; second handle has ratchet pawl that engages <b>toothed</b> coupling <b>ring</b> on perimeter of valve handle. When operator squeezes wrench handles, valve handle rotates with respect to valve body...|$|R
50|$|Although the {{electric}} starter motor {{was to come}} to dominate the car market, in 1912 there were several competing types of starter, with the Adams, S.C.A.T. and Wolseley cars having direct air starters, and Sunbeam introducing an air starter motor with similar approach to that used for the Delco and Scott-Crossley electrical starter motors (i.e. engaging with a <b>toothed</b> <b>ring</b> on the flywheel). The Star and Adler cars had spring motors (sometimes referred to as clockwork motors), which used the energy stored in a spring driving through a reduction gear. If the car failed to start the starter handle {{could be used to}} wind up the spring for a further attempt.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the influence of design features of the flexspline in a harmonic drive, such as the relative radial deformation, the relative coating thickness and the design features of the basic rack tooth profile, on stress values in the bottom lands of a <b>toothed</b> <b>ring.</b> Design/methodology/approach: In numerical calculations, the software developed at the Faculty of Transport of the Silesian University of Technology was used. The program automatically generates a profile of the flexspline and a boundary elements mesh {{on the grounds of the}} flexspline and working tool assigned parameters. In the analysis of the state of stress, the boundary element method (BEM) was applied. Findings: A decreased value of the curve radius of the head of the basic rack tooth profile results in a change in the width of the tooth bottom land, shortening of the transition curve in the tooth base and a reduction of the tooth thickness at its base, which in turn leads to increased values of stress. Yet, the influence of the relative curve radius of the head of the basic rack tooth profile on the stress value is insignificant. The increase of the torque and relative coating thickness for different value of the curve radius of the head of the basic rack tooth profile cause an increase of stress in the bottom lands of the <b>toothed</b> <b>ring.</b> Research limitations/implications: The paper presents strength calculations for the teeth in <b>toothed</b> <b>ring</b> of a flexspline of a double harmonic drive by means of boundary elements method (BEM). The results of numerical calculations correspond in terms of their quality to the results presented in the literature, which were calculated by finite element method (FEM). Originality/value: In the analysis of the state of stress of <b>toothed</b> <b>ring</b> of flexspline, the boundary element method (BEM) was applied...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} the processes which condition {{the quality of}} steel cast strands and properties of rolled products. It touches upon the technology of small-size rings manufacture from the 42 CrMo 4 steel used {{for the production of}} rolling bearings and <b>toothed</b> <b>rings.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Investigations were made on the 42 CrMo 4 steel based process of small-size rings manufacture of weight not exceeding 100 kg and the internal diameter up to 600 mm. Findings: Microstructure heterogeneity has been proven on the cross section of rods and rings under hot rolling and thermal treatment. Non-uniformity in hardness distribution was found on the hot rolled rings’ face surface and cross section. Final products made from rings with heterogeneous properties characterize: difficulties with machining, cracking during surface hardening and decrease of life time. After the process modification, the rings’ microstructure homogeneity and advantageous hardness distribution were obtained. Practical implications: A good quality of final rings after heat treatment is obtained in the case of charge characterized by a uniform pearlitic/ferritic microstructure. After the process technology modification, the rings’ microstructure homogeneity and advantageous hardness distribution were obtained. Originality/value: The minimum processing degree in the rolling of rod products should guarantee obtaining a homogeneous microstructure on the rings cross section and properties which would ensure a good quality and the required functional properties of the final products...|$|R
