The draft order is determined based on the previous season's standings, and the team that had the worst record receives the first pick. In addition, teams which lost free agents in the previous off-season may be awarded compensatory or supplementary picks. The First-Year Player Draft is unrelated to the 1961 expansion draft in which the Astros initially filled their roster.|$|E

50|$|Before {{they were}} the Texas Rangers, the team belonged to the Beltway as the second version of the Washington Senators where they played mediocre {{baseball}} {{most of the time}} for the first 11 years of existence. They replaced the old Washington Senators who had moved to Minnesota to become the Twins in 1961. The new Senators changed into the Texas Rangers in time for the 1972 season and so a rivalry was born. (At one time, the Kansas City Athletics were interested in moving to the Dallas/Fort Worth area in the early 1960s but were voted down, 9-1, by the other American League owners.) <b>The</b> <b>Astros</b> <b>have</b> been in Texas ten years longer than the Rangers, but the Senators/Rangers franchise is one year older than the Astros.

The old Union Station stands beyond the train on the wall and serves as the main entrance for the ballpark. Before its removal after the 2016 season, center field featured an uphill incline known as [...] "Tal's Hill", much like old Crosley Field in Cincinnati and the former Duffy's Cliff at Fenway Park in Boston, although it was created as a decoration, as opposed to being required due to the grade of the land. Also, before the center field fence was moved in after the 2016 season, it was the only park in major league baseball with a flagpole in play, another purely decorative feature borrowed from the old Tiger Stadium in Detroit. First baseman Richie Sexson, then of the Milwaukee Brewers, is the only player to have hit the flagpole during a game. Lance Berkman caught the ball for an out.
