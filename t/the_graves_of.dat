5|$|Methods of {{destroying}} suspected vampires varied, with staking {{the most commonly}} cited method, particularly in southern Slavic cultures.

Potential vampires were most often staked through the heart, though the mouth was targeted in Russia and northern Germany and the stomach in north-eastern Serbia.|$|E
