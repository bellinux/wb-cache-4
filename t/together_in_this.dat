5|$|Following the letters, Jackson {{received}} a parcel containing {{a photograph of}} the fan, as well as a letter and a gun. Jackson was horrified; the letter asked that the pop singer kill himself on a certain day and at a specific time. The fan would do the same once she had killed their baby. She wrote that if they could not be <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> life, then they would be in the next. To his mother's dismay, Jackson had the photograph of the woman framed and hung above the dining room table of their family home. Afterwards, the Jacksons discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.|$|E

Ryan's father stayed in Melbourne and died a year later, aged 62, after a long battle with miners' disease, phthisis tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|Usher {{syndrome}} {{is responsible for}} the majority of deaf-blindness. The word syndrome means that multiple symptoms occur <b>together,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case, deafness and blindness. It occurs in roughly 1 person in 23,000 in the United States, 1 in 28,000 in Norway and 1 in 12,500 in Germany. People with Usher syndrome represent roughly one-sixth of people with retinitis pigmentosa.|$|E

Each of these was a steel tube, and held <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> fashion they presented a considerable range safety issue when they fell {{back to the ground}} after launch. The boosters were equipped with four large swept-wing fins at the extreme rear, behind the rocket exhaust, using a diamond cross-section suitable for supersonic lift.|$|E
25|$|Group {{personal}} pensions are another pension arrangement that are {{personal pensions}}, but {{are linked to}} an employer. A group personal pension plan (GPPP) can be established by an employer {{as a way of}} providing all of its employees with access to a pension plan run by a single provider. By grouping all the employees <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> way, it is normally possible for the employer to negotiate favourable terms with the provider, thus reducing the cost of pension provision to the employees. The employer will also normally contribute to the GPPP.|$|E
25|$|In January 1943, Hungary's {{enthusiasm for}} the war effort, never {{especially}} high, suffered a tremendous blow. The Soviet army, in the full momentum of its triumphant turnaround after the Battle of Stalingrad, punched through Romanian troops at {{a bend in the}} Don River and virtually obliterated the Second Hungarian Army in a few days' fighting. In this single action, Hungarian combat fatalities jumped by 80,000. Jew and non-Jew suffered <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> defeat, as the Hungarian troops had been accompanied by some 40,000 Jews and political prisoners in forced-labour units whose job had been to clear minefields.|$|E

25|$|Others, however, view him {{not as a}} builder, {{but rather}} as a conqueror. He was of Albanian origin rather than Egyptian, and {{throughout}} his reign, Turkish was the official language of his court rather than Arabic. Some argue that he exploited Egyptian manpower and resources for his own personal ends, not Egyptian national ones, with the manpower requirements that he placed on Egyptians being particularly onerous. Taken <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> light, Muhammad Ali is cast by some as another {{in a long line of}} foreign conquerors dating back to the Persian occupation in 525B.C. This view, however, is at odds with the majority opinion of Egyptian, and other Arab historians, and Egyptian public opinion.|$|E
25|$|An {{internal}} collet {{can be used}} to lock two telescoping tubes <b>together.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> {{case the}} collet {{is in the form of}} a truncated cone drilled and threaded down the centreline. The collet diameter matches the bore of the inner tube, having the larger end slightly greater than the bore while the smaller diameter is slightly less than the bore. A threaded stud, anchored at its other end to the tube, is then used to pull the collet into the tube. The increasing diameter of the collet forces the inner tube to expand and be pushed against the inner wall of the outer tube thus locking the two tubes together. The inner tube is often slotted to facilitate this expansion.|$|E
25|$|Some recordings, such as {{books for}} the blind, were pressed at rpm. Prestige Records {{released}} jazz records in this format in the late 1950s; for example, two of their Miles Davis albums were paired <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> format. Peter Goldmark, the man who developed the rpm record, developed the Highway Hi-Fi rpm record to be played in Chrysler automobiles, but poor performance {{of the system and}} weak implementation by Chrysler and Columbia led to the demise of the rpm records. Subsequently, the rpm speed was used for narrated publications for the blind and visually impaired, and were never widely commercially available, although it was common to see new turntable models with a 16rpm speed setting produced as late as the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|On 21 June 1792, {{dealing with}} poor weather and dwindling food supplies, Vancouver decided {{to head back}} to HMS Discovery some 84 miles away; on their return they {{encountered}} the Spanish ships under the respective commands of Capt. Malaspina and Galiano (whom Lt. Broughton had already met), near present-day Vancouver, British Columbia. Both were exploring and mapping the Strait of Georgia, seeking a possible Northwest Passage and a determination of whether Vancouver Island was an island or part of the mainland. The two commanders established a friendly relationship and agreed to assist one another by dividing up the surveying work and sharing charts. They worked <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> way until 13 July, after which each resumed circumnavigating Vancouver Island separately. Galiano's ships reached Nootka Sound, completing the circuit, on 31 August. Vancouver's ships had arrived earlier. Thus Vancouver was the first European to prove the insularity of Vancouver Island (Meares' claims on the matter having been another casualty), while Galiano was the first to circumnavigate it. Vancouver had not set out from Nootka but rather began at the Strait of Juan de Fuca, while Galiano began his circumnavigation at Nootka.|$|E
25|$|New {{information}} obtained by dbSNP becomes {{available to the}} public periodically in a series of “builds” (i.e. revisions and releases of data). There is no schedule for releasing new builds; instead, builds are usually released when a new genome build becomes available, assuming that the genome has some cataloged variation associated with it. This occurs approximately every 1–2 months. Genome sequences often contain errors so reference SNPs (“refSNP”) from previous builds, as well as new submitted SNPs, are re-mapped to the newly available genome sequence through multiple cycles of BLAST and MegaBLAST. Multiple submitted SNPs, if mapping to the same location, are clustered into one refSNP cluster and are assigned a reference SNP ID number. However, if two refSNP cluster records are found to map to the same location (i.e. are identical), then dbSNP will also merge those records <b>together.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> case, the smallest refSNP number ID (i.e. the earliest record) would now represent both records, and the larger refSNP number IDs would become obsolete. These obsolete refSNP number IDs and are not used again for new records. When a merger of two refSNP records occurs, the change is tracked, and the former refSNP number IDs can still be used as a search query. This process of merging identical records together reduces redundancy within dbSNP.|$|E
25|$|Kaplan credits artist Arnold Tsang {{from coming}} up with the {{preliminary}} designs of all the heroes in the game. The narrative and characters themselves were then developed through an iterative process between the gameplay developers, artists, and promotional media as they worked to bring the narrative <b>together.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> regards, Torbjörn was the defining character for the game, as while he was not created first, his art style was originally created by Tsang to help bridge the gap between the Warcraft universe to Overwatch. Blizzard's art director Sam Didier reviewed Tsang's original design, prompting several questions to help tighten the art design that led to Torbjörn's gameplay mechanics, and subsequently, Torbjörn's appearance was used as a baseline in all other character and map designs to make sure that these assets would appear to fit into the same universe as Torbjörn. Another example is Doomfist, a character introduced into one of the game's promotional videos where his gauntlet was on display. This {{led to the creation of}} one of the maps that expanded upon the Doomfist concept, making that a title passed down among others in the past, and seeding some of the existing heroes' backstory has had connections to the Doomfist title. This process gave them a sufficient starting point to work from in introducing Doomfist as a playable hero in Overwatch. Other examples of similar iterative expansion to the characters given by Metzen and Chu include the heroes Genji and Hanzo who were characters borne out of an initial single character concept and leading to them being rivals of each other, and the introduction of Lúcio as a means to expand upon the loosely connected Vishkar Corporation concept that was part of Symmetra's backstory.|$|E
50|$|Millard Fillmore was {{the only}} {{incumbent}} U.S. president, who visited Germany in the 19th century. In 1855, he met with Alexander von Humboldt and King Friedrich Wilhelm IV <b>together</b> <b>in</b> Berlin. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> period 1.5 million German emigrated to the U.S., {{and there were a}} total of 14 German consulates in New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, New Orleans, St. Louis, Galveston, Savannah, Cincinnati, San Francisco, Louisville, Milwaukee, Chicago, Boston and New Bedford.|$|R

500|$|A {{significant}} factor {{in the success of}} the Birmingham campaign was the structure of the city government and the personality of its contentious Commissioner of Public Safety, Eugene [...] "Bull" [...] Connor. Described as an [...] "arch-segregationist" [...] by Time magazine, Connor asserted that the city [...] "ain't gonna segregate no niggers and whites <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> town [...] ". He also apparently believed that the Civil Rights Movement was a Communist plot, and after the churches were bombed, Connor blamed the violence on local blacks.|$|E
500|$|... "Wannabe" [...] was {{completed}} in thirty minutes—mainly because the group had written and composed parts of the song beforehand—in what Brown describes as a [...] "sudden creative frenzy." [...] During the session, Brown and Bunton {{came up with the}} idea of including a rap near the end of the song. At this point the group got very motivated, and incorporated the word [...] "zigazig-ha" [...] into the lyrics. Chisholm told Billboard magazine: [...] "You know when you're in a gang and you're having a laugh and you make up silly words? Well we were having a giggle and we made up this silly word, zigazig-ha. We were in the studio and it all came <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> song." ...|$|E
500|$|Reginald Heber, the Lord Bishop of Calcutta, {{noted that}} disciples of Swaminarayan cut across all castes, and even {{included}} Muslims. He writes [...] "they all pray to one God with no difference of castes. They live {{as if they}} were brothers." [...] Furthermore, in a meeting with Swaminarayan, he noted that [...] " [...] did not regard the subject as of much importance, but that he wished not to give offense (to ancient Hindu system); that people might eat separately or <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world, but that above [...] "oopur" [...] pointing to heaven, those distinctions would cease." [...] Swaminarayan worked thus to dispel the myth that moksha (salvation) was not attainable by everyone. He taught that the soul is neither male nor female, nor yoked to any specific caste.|$|E

500|$|Josh Harrison of Ology {{deemed the}} episode a [...] "good sign" [...] {{that the second}} season will be [...] "just as good, if not better" [...] than the first season. He said, [...] "The way it all works <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> episode ... is subtle and {{surprising}} but nevertheless convincing evidence that there's method to the madness. Ugly Americans knows when to play this card; at all other junctures, it's got the right instinct when it shows us yet more madness." [...] Harrison praised the battle scene between the wizards and the demons, calling it [...] "one of the best single sequences in the series so far". In contrast, The Standard-Times critic Kevin McDonough was more critical regarding the episode, noting that it [...] "tries a tad too hard". McDonough commented: [...] "The efforts to meld 1980s summer-camp fantasy comedies with the Harry Potter movies are more odd than amusing. Then again, that pretty much sums up Ugly Americans itself." ...|$|E
500|$|Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush {{felt the}} line [...] "had {{to see that}} coming" [...] applied to many {{elements}} of the episode, but said [...] "there’s {{a lot of fun}} to be had" [...] and praised the use of the character James, dealing with the character's [...] "self-loathing" [...] well while acknowledging his status as the series' pre-Ghost Rider Ghost Rider. Fitzpatrick added that he was [...] "still not crazy about whatever’s going on with “Lucy” and her terrible ghost effects", and felt the Aida story was being pushed aside in favor of a seemingly corporate-mandated Ghost Rider focus. Terri Schwartz at IGN gave the episode a [...] "great" [...] 8.5 out of 10, praising the executive producers for their timing in bringing the season's different groups of characters <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> episode. Schwartz praised the car chase, the handling of the relationship between Simmons and Fitz in regards to his keeping Aida a secret from her, and the use of James, taking advantage of the audience's familiarity of him from the previous season.|$|E

[...] "Dread and the Fugitive Mind" [...] was released on the [...] compilation a year earlier, at the insistence of Megadeth's former label, Capitol Records. The album's opener, [...] "Disconnect", is explained by Mustaine as being about living a double life and [...] "the person I want you to think that I am and the person inside that I really know I am." [...] "Coming Home" [...] was only available on the Japanese pressing as a bonus track, but has since been released on the Warchest box set. Mustaine has stated that concept for [...] "Promises" [...] is [...] "prejudiced relationships," [...] such as those between a Catholic and a Protestant in Ireland, interracial and same-sex relationships, [...] "it could be about a guy and a sheep for all I care.
