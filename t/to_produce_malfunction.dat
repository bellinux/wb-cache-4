40|$|Abstract. Various {{mechanical}} systems contain high-speed rotating bodies, which {{are affected by}} small eccentricities. During operation, such shape irregularities are the cause of vibrations that can <b>produce</b> <b>malfunctioning,</b> as well as early wear development in the bearings and {{in other parts of}} the devices. In order to control and reduce these undesirable effects, the eccentricity of the rotors must be determined, which, due to their geometrical complexity, can be seldom achieved by direct measurement. The paper proposes an analytic-experimental method for determining the eccentricity of a cantilever rotor, based on the statistical processing of data obtained by measuring the vibrations of its bearing. The application of the method is illustrated on a laboratory testing model built by the authors...|$|R

As early as 1991 he sardonically coined the acronym DADD, stating, [...] "... most so-called ADHD {{children are not}} receiving sufficient attention from their fathers who are separated from the family, too preoccupied with work and other things, or otherwise impaired {{in their ability to}} parent. In many cases the appropriate diagnosis is Dad Attention Deficit Disorder (DADD)". Breggin has written two books specifically on the topic entitled, Talking Back to Ritalin and The Ritalin Factbook. In these books he has made controversial claims, such as [...] "Ritalin 'works' by <b>producing</b> <b>malfunctions</b> in the brain rather than by improving brain function.

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the most}} {{important}} problems on the Moon, reported during the Apollo missions, is lunar dust. Its surface is covered with a layer of very fine grains (20 µm and less), very abrasive which tend to stick on any surface, <b>producing</b> <b>malfunction</b> of devices, degradation of thermal control coatings or bad accuracy of measurements. These dusts were also observed to levitate above the lunar surface by astronauts and, thereby, generated a reduced visibility. It is therefore necessary to understand the physical mechanisms that govern this dynamics on the Moon and on asteroids by providing a physical model taking into account electrostatic charge phenomena, transport and adhesion of dust, stemming from interactions with the space environment and materials of interest for exploration systems. Consequently, it is required to know the environmental conditions favoring transport of particles to set up experiments. In this article, semi-analytical models of charged dust dynamics will be presented, based on literature data of the conditions over the Moon surface. We also present experimental investigations conducted in ONERA vacuum chamber in Toulouse. The main objective of this experimental study is to observe the levitation of dust grains as a function of key parameters: electric field, dust radius distribution, charging environments...|$|R
40|$|Background. Isolated {{aneurysm}} {{of internal}} iliac artery {{is very rare}} and often asymptomatic. Aneurysm itself can <b>produce</b> <b>malfunction</b> of the pelvic organs. Aneurysm rupture is followed by high mortality. Case report. A 76 -year old patient {{was admitted to the}} hospital with abdominal and left groin pain, disuric problems, obstipation and the signs of intestinal subocclusion. These problems persisted over the last few months. Digitorectal examination showed pulsatile tumor. Computed tomography and angiography revealed isolated aneurysm of the left internal iliac artery with a maximal diametar of 13. 5 cm. The aneurysm was treated operatively using extraperitoneal approach in general anesthesia. During the operation a Cell Saver was used. The left internal iliac artery was resected and ligated with end-aneurysmatic suture of its branches. Conclusion. Isolated aneurysm of the internal iliac artery should be considered by differential diagnosis in any case of the occurrence of disorders of the pervic organs functions. Clinical findings, ultrasound examination, computed tomography and angiography are the diagnostic techniques of choice which can confirm the diagnosis. Surgical treatment with the use of retroperitoneal approach lead to complete recovery, so it could be considered the method of choice for patients with the condition permitting a radical surgical approach. ...|$|R
