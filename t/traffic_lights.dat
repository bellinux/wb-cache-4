5|$|Green can {{communicate}} safety to proceed, as in <b>traffic</b> <b>lights.</b> Green and red were standardized as {{the colors of}} international railroad signals in the 19th century. The first traffic light, using green and red gas lamps, was erected in 1868 {{in front of the}} Houses of Parliament in London. It exploded the following year, injuring the policeman who operated it. In 1912, the first modern electric <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> were put up in Salt Lake City, Utah. Red was chosen largely because of its high visibility, and its association with danger, while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for red. Today green lights universally signal that a system is turned on and working as it should. In many video games, green signifies both health and completed objectives, opposite red.|$|E

5|$|The Delmar Bypass {{was opened}} in December 1963, {{connecting}} Elm Avenue {{in the west}} to U.S. Route9W in the east. The state did not add <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> to any of the four intersections on the bypass as a late 1963 study indicated that the signals were unnecessary. In mid-January 1964, the Bethlehem Town Board pushed the state to add <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> to every intersection in the wake of several accidents and near-misses at the crossings. This request was eventually granted. The Delmar Bypass did not have a signed route number until the 1970s when NY32 was realigned to follow the highway. As a result, NY335 no longer connected to a signed route at its south end.|$|E

5|$|Sheridan Drive was {{constructed}} during the early1920s as {{a town of}} Tonawanda project to help alleviate the anticipated growth of the village of Kenmore.

The town also felt that {{the construction of a}} superhighway {{in the middle of the}} country in Tonawanda was unjustified with the average traffic in that area. After construction of Sheridan Drive was completed in 1925, a monument with a statue of General Phillip Sheridan {{was constructed}} to commemorate the new road. However, the taxpayers feeling enough money had already been spent on the road, the statue of Sheridan was never constructed and only the monument to the road's construction was completed.

40|$|Abstract- There {{are many}} {{problems}} of congestion with <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> in many cities. This problem of congestion {{can be caused}} by long time delays of <b>traffic</b> <b>light’s</b> Red light. When there are emergency case at <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> intersection which are always busy with many vehicles, this problem can also be caused. The possibilities of traffic jams caused by <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> can reduce by using the Programmable Integrated Circuit (PIC) 16 F 877 A microcontroller. The intended system is to change the sequence back to the normal sequence after triggering for the emergency modes by using the controller. Many accidents which often happen at the <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> intersections will be reduced because of using this system. The system that provides the traffic control of six way and four junction of modern <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> has been implemented with arrowed signal for each direction. The arrowed signal of red, yellow and green light are displayed with LEDs. There are two modes of <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> sequence in this system. One is the normal sequence and the other is the emergency sequence. The phases of red, yellow and green are determined by computer programming based on the patterns of <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> congestion...|$|R
40|$|The traffic {{network of}} a city can be modeled by a graph in which {{vertices}} represent the intersections of roads and edges represent the segments of roads.

40|$|This paper introduces, prices, and {{analyzes}} <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> options. The <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> {{option is}} an innovative structured OTC derivative developed independently by several London-based investment banks {{to suit the}} needs of Danish life and pension (L&P) companies, which must comply with the <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> solvency stress test system introduced by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (DFSA) in June 2001. This monitoring system requires L&P companies to submit regular reports documenting {{the sensitivity of the}} companies’ base capital to certain pre-defined market shocks – the red and yellow light scenarios. These stress scenarios entail drops in interest rates as well as in stock prices, and <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> options are thus designed to pay off and preserve sufficient capital when interest rates and stock prices fall simultaneously. Sweden’s FSA implemented a <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> system in January 2006, and supervisory authorities in many other European countries have implemented similar regulation. <b>Traffic</b> <b>light</b> options are therefore likely {{to attract the attention of}} a wider audience of pension fund managers in the future.

40|$|Abstract- Traffic {{congestion}} {{problem is the}} phenomena which contributed a huge obstacle to the transportation system. This will cause many problems mainly when there are emergency cases at <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> intersections which are always busy and jammed with many vehicles. This situation becomes more crucial when special routing is not provided for the emergency vehicles such as ambulance, patrol car and fire truck when red sign light. To overcome this situation, a <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> controller system for emergency vehicle using 434 MHz Radio and Programmable Integrated Circuit (PIC) {{is designed to help}} traffic control and also other road users when emergency situation occurs. The system works when an emergency vehicle approaching the <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> intersections, the emergency vehicle will send a signal via dedicated device to the receiver at <b>traffic</b> <b>light.</b> The receiver or controller receives emergency signals; it changes the <b>traffic</b> red <b>light</b> to green light in a specific duration of time. This system will help to reduce accidents which happen at the <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> intersections because of other vehicle had to huddle for given route to emergency vehicle. The <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> control system for emergency vehicle using radio frequency (RF) assisted the emergency vehicle to cross at the intersection of <b>traffic</b> <b>light.</b> In the future, the development of this system can be improved by analyzing the stability of Radio Frequency system e. g. frequency range and can be developed for real <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> system.
