Statistics vary at <b>the</b> <b>elementary</b> <b>level,</b> suggesting that between 65 and 70% of school-aged children attend primary school; Approximately 61% attend secondary school. Student-teacher ratios are high: 45 to 1 at <b>the</b> <b>elementary</b> <b>level</b> and 54 to 1 {{at the secondary}} level. There are an average 63 students per classroom at <b>the</b> <b>elementary</b> <b>level</b> and 97 per classroom at the secondary level. Learning hours at school are often less than six hours per day. The literacy rate in Eritrea is high. For men in the age 18–24 the literacy rate is 92.6% in (2008–2012), {{for women in the}} age 18–24 the literacy rate is 87.7% (2008–2012) The literacy rate for the total population is 81%,. Barriers to education in Eritrea include traditional taboos, school fees (for registration and materials), and the opportunity costs of low-income households.|$|E
