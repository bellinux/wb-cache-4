She said he was short with her and seemed to hang up in irritation, something he had never done before; he was by all accounts an even-tempered man. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, telephoned around 10 pm. She spoke to Sheila, who she said was quiet, then to June, who seemed normal.|$|E
5|$|According {{to genetic}} studies, the {{families}} Hyloidea, Microhylidae, and the clade Natatanura (comprising about 88% of living frogs) diversified simultaneously some 66 million years ago, {{soon after the}} Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event associated with the Chicxulub impactor. All origins of arboreality (e.g. in Hyloidea and Natatanura) follow from <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> the resurgence of forest that occurred afterwards.|$|E

In both the 2006 and 2007 seasons the Highlander's finished ninth with 27 competition points when they won six and five matches respectively. Following their 2007 season coach Greg Cooper left the franchise, and was replaced by Glenn Moore. Moore coached the team for three season, but achieved only ten wins during <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> finished no higher than ninth.

5|$|By the 1970s and 1980s, the New York City Subway was at {{an all-time}} low. Ridership had dropped to 1910s levels, and {{graffiti}} and crime were rampant on the subway; in general, the subway was very poorly maintained during <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> delays and track problems were common. Still, the NYCTA managed to open six new subway stations in the 1980s, make the current fleet of subway cars graffiti-free, as well as order 1,775 new subway cars. By the early 1990s, conditions had improved significantly, although maintenance backlogs accumulated during those 20 years are still being fixed today.|$|E
5|$|Coventry is {{an ancient}} city and a {{metropolitan}} borough in the West Midlands of England. The city's history dates back to at least the 11thcentury (CE), and by the 14thcentury, it was a thriving centre of commerce.

5|$|Critics {{also pointed}} out that the index could allow the city to reach lethally high levels of carbon {{monoxide}} without any alert if the levels of other pollutants remained low. However, the department had to contend with the fact that no universally accepted standards for recording smog existed at <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> many of the flaws existed {{for lack of a better}} alternative. During the 1966 smog, one of the former commissioners said he would have readily adopted a better system, if one existed.|$|E
5|$|Crytek then {{pitched the}} game to {{different}} publishers, and eventually, in 2009, the company pitched the two projects to Microsoft. According to Nick Button-Brown, the general manager at Crytek, the game was not functional at <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> only served {{to prove to the}} publisher that a first-person melee game was fun for players. The representative from Microsoft, Phil Spencer, admired Crytek's intention to expand, and thought that Microsoft's games line up for the Xbox 360 was lacking a first-person melee-combat game. As a result, they accepted to publish Kingdoms, and rejected Kings. The two companies agreed that the project would be a natural fit for Microsoft's yet-to-be-announced Kinect.|$|E
5|$|Daredevil was {{released}} on February 14, 2003. It received generally mixed reviews from critics with many praising the action sequences, acting performances, its soundtrack, storyline and its visual style and stunts, while many negatively criticized its dramatic depth and commented that the film resembles a Greek tragedy.

5|$|Despite his partial {{recovery}} evident in America, Weber {{felt that he}} was unable to resume regular teaching at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> continued on as a private scholar, helped by an inheritance in 1907. In 1909, disappointed with the Verein, he co-founded the German Sociological Association (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie, or DGS) and served as its first treasurer. He would, however, resign from the DGS in 1912. In 1912, Weber tried to organise a left-wing political party to combine social-democrats and liberals. This attempt was unsuccessful, in part because many liberals feared social-democratic revolutionary ideals.|$|E

It was the contemporary custom for scene shifts to take place in sight of the audience, these changes being reflected musically by changes in instrumentation, key and style.|$|E

5|$|Industry representatives {{complained that}} the final rule overstated the {{environmental}} effects of corn ethanol, and also criticized the inclusion of ILUC as an unfair penalty to domestic corn ethanol because deforestation {{in the developing world}} was being tied to U.S. ethanol production.
