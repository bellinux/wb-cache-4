5|$|In 2010, a European science team {{investigated}} the star using the CORALIE spectrograph and collected seventeen spectra of WASP-44. From <b>the</b> <b>spectra,</b> radial velocity measurements were extrapolated. Analysis of collected CORALIE data {{ruled out the}} possibility that the detected radial velocity was caused by the blended spectrum of a spectroscopic binary star, supporting the possibility that the body orbiting WASP-44 was indeed a planet, designated WASP-44b.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century, {{information}} about the types and distances of stars became more readily available. <b>The</b> <b>spectra</b> of stars were shown to have distinctive features, which allowed them to be categorized. Annie Jump Cannon and Edward C. Pickering at Harvard College Observatory developed a method of categorization that became known as the Harvard Classification Scheme, published in the Harvard Annals in 1901.|$|E
3000|$|Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> σ ([...] T [...]) [...] {{naturally}} splits {{into three}} disjoint sets, {{some of which}} may be empty. The discrete splitting of <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> can be defined as <b>the</b> point <b>spectrum,</b> <b>the</b> continuous <b>spectrum</b> and <b>the</b> residual <b>spectrum</b> as follows.|$|R
50|$|The {{boundedness}} of <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> {{follows from}} <b>the</b> Neumann series expansion in λ; <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> σ(T) is bounded by ||T||. A similar result shows the closedness of <b>the</b> <b>spectrum.</b>|$|R
30|$|In {{the serving}} stage, {{we have two}} {{approaches}} of retrieving <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> map: a centralized approach and a decentralized approach. The centralized approach is to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> map from <b>the</b> RRM server while the decentralized approach is to retrieve it from neighboring WSAPs. Through coexistence beacon frames, WSAPs can broadcast their revised spectrum map that reflects <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> sensing results not only from their own spectrum sensing but also collected from their associated clients. Thus, the WSAPs that can interpret coexistence beacon frames of their neighboring WSAPs can update their spectrum map and spectrum sensing results with <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> map of their neighboring WSAPs and provide their updated spectrum sensing results to the RRM server. <b>The</b> <b>spectrum</b> sensing results merging <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> sensing results of neighboring WSAPs {{can contribute to the}} increase in the accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> map. However, when the accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> map becomes less than a certain level, <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> map starts from the learning stage again.|$|R
5|$|On July 2, 2009, July 3, 2009, and August 8, 2009, {{use of the}} NIFS {{integral}} field spectrograph with ALTAIR {{allowed the}} astronomers {{to collect data on}} the spectrum of the faint object and its star. Analysis of <b>the</b> <b>spectra</b> and the objects' astrometry (how the star and the faint object change position in the sky) led to the confirmation of the companion HIP 78530 b.|$|E
5|$|S-type (silicate-rich) asteroids {{are more}} common toward the inner region of the belt, within 2.5 AU of the Sun. <b>The</b> <b>spectra</b> of their {{surfaces}} reveal the presence of silicates and some metal, but no significant carbonaceous compounds. This indicates that their materials have been significantly modified from their primordial composition, probably through melting and reformation. They have a relatively high albedo, and form about 17% of the total asteroid population.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{investigated}} {{the possibility that}} the transit signal detected by Kepler was actually due to a third star in the system that eclipsed its sister stars. However a bisector analysis of <b>the</b> <b>spectra</b> of KOI-98's star ruled out that hypothesis.|$|E
40|$|The {{main idea}} of the present paper is to compute <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> and <b>the</b> fine <b>spectrum</b> of <b>the</b> {{generalized}} difference operator over the sequence spaces. The operator denotes a triangular sequential band matrix defined by with for, where or,; the set nonnegative integers and is either a constant or strictly decreasing sequence of positive real numbers satisfying certain conditions. Finally, we obtain <b>the</b> <b>spectrum,</b> <b>the</b> point <b>spectrum,</b> <b>the</b> residual <b>spectrum,</b> and <b>the</b> continuous <b>spectrum</b> of <b>the</b> operator over the sequence spaces and. These results are more general and comprehensive than <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> of <b>the</b> difference operators,,,, and and include some other special cases such as <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> of <b>the</b> operators,, and over the sequence spaces or...|$|R
30|$|Spectrum decision. Based on <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> {{availability}} information {{acquired through}} <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> sensing, policy guidelines, user requirements, and registry of <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> use, CR characterizes radio frequency spectrum possible for various models of <b>the</b> dynamic <b>spectrum</b> access. In <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> decision, CR or the centralized entity determines the carrier frequency, channel bandwidth, transmission power, modulation, coding, communication technology, {{together with other}} operational, and technical parameters used for the CR operation.|$|R
30|$|Dynamic {{exclusive}} use model: <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> basically is allocated exclusively to specific services or operators. However, <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> property rights framework allows opening a secondary market where the licensed users can sell and trade {{portion of their}} <b>spectrum,</b> whereas <b>the</b> dynamic <b>spectrum</b> allocation framework aims at providing a better allocation of <b>the</b> <b>spectrum,</b> to exclusive services, by adapting <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> allocation to space and time network load information.|$|R
5|$|By 1914, {{experiments}} by physicists Ernest Rutherford, Henry Moseley, James Franck and Gustav Hertz {{had largely}} established {{the structure of}} an atom as a dense nucleus of positive charge surrounded by lower-mass electrons. In 1913, Danish physicist Niels Bohr postulated that electrons resided in quantized energy states, with their energies determined by the angular momentum of the electron's orbit about the nucleus. The electrons could move between those states, or orbits, by the emission or absorption of photons of specific frequencies. By means of these quantized orbits, he accurately explained the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom. However, Bohr's model failed {{to account for the}} relative intensities of the spectral lines and it was unsuccessful in explaining <b>the</b> <b>spectra</b> of more complex atoms.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Smyth {{worked in}} the Chemical Warfare Service and at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. After earning his second Ph.D., he {{returned}} to Princeton {{for the last year}} of his NRC fellowship. During his early years on the Princeton faculty he lived in the Graduate College west of the main campus. He was appointed an instructor in 1924, an assistant professor in 1925, an associate professor in 1929, and a full professor in 1936. In 1935 he became chairman of the Department of Physics, a position he held until 1949. During 1931–32 he was a Guggenheim Fellow at the University of Göttingen, where he studied <b>the</b> <b>spectra</b> of triatomic molecules, particularly carbon dioxide, with James Franck.|$|E
5|$|Important {{theoretical}} work on {{the physical}} structure of stars occurred during {{the first decades of}} the twentieth century. In 1913, the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram was developed, propelling the astrophysical study of stars. Successful models were developed to explain the interiors of stars and stellar evolution. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin first proposed that stars were made primarily of hydrogen and helium in her 1925 PhD thesis. <b>The</b> <b>spectra</b> of stars were further understood through advances in quantum physics. This allowed the chemical composition of the stellar atmosphere to be determined.|$|E
30|$|Compared to the {{conventional}} RA schemes, the proposed cross-layer design with <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> underlay sharing method could share <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> with <b>the</b> PUs more effectively. Simulation results illustrate that our proposed design has a significant performance gain. On the other hand, the comparision between <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> underlay and overlay has shown {{that if there is}} available subbands in the PS, it has <b>the</b> best <b>spectrum</b> efficiency with both <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> underlay and overlay sharing methods.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{essential}} <b>spectrum</b> {{is always}} closed, {{and it is}} a subset of <b>the</b> <b>spectrum.</b> Since T is self-adjoint, <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> is contained on the real axis.|$|R
30|$|Spectrum Aggregation Limitation: Due to the {{hardware}} capability, only <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> bands {{within a certain}} range can be aggregated together for a single user. <b>The</b> <b>spectrum</b> aggregation range leads to an additional constraint when the SUs access <b>the</b> <b>spectrum.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1907, Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds {{demonstrated}} that alpha particles are helium nuclei {{by allowing the}} particles to penetrate the thin glass wall of an evacuated tube, then creating a discharge in the tube to study <b>the</b> <b>spectra</b> of the new gas inside. In 1908, helium was first liquefied by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes by cooling the gas to less than one kelvin. He tried to solidify it by further reducing the temperature but failed because helium does not solidify at atmospheric pressure. Onnes' student Willem Hendrik Keesom was eventually able to solidify 1cm3 of helium in 1926 by applying additional external pressure.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, astronomers {{found what}} {{they believe to be}} {{pristine}} clouds of primordial gas by analyzing absorption lines in <b>the</b> <b>spectra</b> of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium. Since the clouds of gas have no heavy elements, they likely formed in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, during Big Bang nucleosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|Spectra of {{the main}} ring {{obtained}} by the HST, Keck, Galileo and Cassini have shown that particles forming it are red, i.e. their albedo is higher at longer wavelengths. The existing spectra span the range 0.5–2.5 μm. No spectral features have been found so far which {{can be attributed to}} particular chemical compounds, although the Cassini observations yielded evidence for absorption bands near 0.8μm and 2.2μm. <b>The</b> <b>spectra</b> {{of the main}} ring are very similar to Adrastea and Amalthea.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Spectrum</b> {{version of}} <b>the</b> game also earned {{critical}} acclaim. <b>The</b> <b>Spectrum</b> version was also commercially successful, reaching 4th place on <b>the</b> UK <b>Spectrum</b> chart in May 1989.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>spectrum</b> of R Scuti is peculiar, {{especially}} at cooler temperatures near the minima. In deep minima, much of <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> corresponds {{to an early}} K supergiant, but <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> also develops TiO bands more typical of an M-class star.|$|R
50|$|The first {{detailed}} study of <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> of RU Cam showed that it changed during the brightness variations. From partway down the descending branch of the light curve to just after minimum brightness, <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> is class R with hydrogen absorption lines. <b>The</b> <b>spectrum</b> then develops hydrogen emission lines. For several days either side of maximum brightness, <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> becomes a relatively normal class K.|$|R
5|$|Spedding's {{graduation}} {{coincided with}} the onset of the Great Depression, and jobs became hard to find. Spedding received a National Research Fellowship from 1930 to 1932, enabling him to stay at Berkeley and continue his research into <b>the</b> <b>spectra</b> of solids. While hiking in northern California, he met Ethel Annie MacFarlane, who shared his passion for camping, hiking and mountain climbing. Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, she was a graduate of the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Toronto, where she had earned a master's degree in history. When they met, she was teaching at Victoria High School in Victoria, British Columbia. They were married on June 21, 1931. They had a daughter, Mary Anne Elizabeth, who was born in 1939.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo images {{also led}} to the {{discovery}} that space weathering was taking place on Ida, a process which causes older regions to become more red in color over time. The same process affects both Ida and its moon, although Dactyl shows a lesser change. The weathering of Ida's surface revealed another detail about its composition: the reflection spectra of freshly exposed parts of the surface resembled that of OC meteorites, but the older regions matched <b>the</b> <b>spectra</b> of S-type asteroids.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spectral}} {{classification of}} these distant supernovae {{was performed by}} Rudolph Minkowski in 1941. He categorized them into two types, based {{on whether or not}} lines of the element hydrogen appeared in the supernova spectrum. Zwicky later proposed additional types III, IV, and V, although these are no longer used and now appear to be associated with single peculiar supernova types. Further sub-division of <b>the</b> <b>spectra</b> categories resulted in the modern supernova classification scheme.|$|E
30|$|CR {{has been}} {{proposed}} as the means to promote efficient utilization of <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> by exploiting <b>the</b> existence of <b>spectrum</b> holes. <b>The</b> <b>spectrum</b> use is concentrated on certain portions of <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> while {{a significant amount of}} <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> remains unused. It is thus key for the development of CR to invent fast and highly robust ways of determining whether a frequency band is available or occupied. This is <b>the</b> area of <b>spectrum</b> sensing for CR which will be considered in this article.|$|R
50|$|Example For a {{diagonal}} matrix, the Gershgorin discs coincide with <b>the</b> <b>spectrum.</b> Conversely, if <b>the</b> Gershgorin discs coincide with <b>the</b> <b>spectrum,</b> <b>the</b> matrix is diagonal.|$|R
50|$|With 4G {{deployment}} rising, it {{is critical}} to have the airwave space to support future innovation and to avoid <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> crunch. This provides clearance in <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> that is already allocated to wireless carriers. The CTIA also have requested access to existing utility poles where new construction is not possible. Although <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> is wide, <b>the</b> science and physics of <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> still create limited amounts of space.|$|R
5|$|The {{science of}} stellar {{spectroscopy}} was pioneered by Joseph von Fraunhofer and Angelo Secchi. By comparing <b>the</b> <b>spectra</b> of {{stars such as}} Sirius to the Sun, they found differences in the strength and number of their absorption lines—the dark lines in a stellar spectra caused by the atmosphere's absorption of specific frequencies. In 1865 Secchi began classifying stars into spectral types. However, the modern version of the stellar classification scheme was developed by Annie J. Cannon during the 1900s.|$|E
5|$|While at high school, Levi {{decided that}} she would become a scientist. Her final year was devoted to a physics project on spectra and photography, which became her Oberreal Abiturium. She was the only girl in her class to major in physics that year. After her {{graduation}} in April 1928, her father sent her to England for six months to learn English and good manners. She entered the University of Munich in 1929, where she listened to lectures by Arnold Sommerfeld. For her doctorate, her father managed to get her accepted into the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry at Berlin-Dahlem, where she wrote her thesis on <b>the</b> <b>spectra</b> of alkali metal halides, {{under the supervision of}} Peter Pringsheim and Fritz Haber.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Spectrum</b> Policy Task Force {{recommends}} {{flexibility of}} <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> for licensed and unlicensed users. Along with giving users the autonomy {{to make good}} use of <b>the</b> <b>spectrum,</b> <b>the</b> FCC should have clear regulations in place so that users can understand and comply with these rules, e.g. power limits and interference protection.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>spectrum</b> {{property}} rights model advocates that <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> resources {{should be treated}} like land, i.e. private ownership of spectrum portions should be permitted. The allocation of these portions should be implemented by means of market forces. <b>The</b> <b>spectrum</b> owners {{should be able to}} trade these portions in secondary markets. Alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> owners would be able to use their bands in any way they want through any technology they prefer (service and technology neutrality). Although <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> {{property rights}} model advocates exclusive allocation of transmission rights, it {{is not the same as}} a licensed regime. The main difference is the service and technology neutrality advocated in <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> property rights approach, as opposed to strict requirements on services and communications technologies inherent in licensed governance regimes.|$|R
