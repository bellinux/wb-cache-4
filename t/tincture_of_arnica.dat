40|$|Arnica montana (L.) is an {{endangered}} and endemic medicinal plant species in Europe. The pressure on natural sources of this plant is alleviated by a suitable use <b>of</b> <b>arnica</b> {{resources in the}} European region and introduction into cultivation. The objective {{of this study was}} to describe the impact of different ways of plant propagation and introduction on the growth and reproduction mode of this species. During the six consecutive years of the field experiment, the vegetative and reproductive traits were monitored, and survival time was assessed. The particular ways <b>of</b> <b>arnica</b> plant propagation and introduction determined all the intrinsic species traits and plant survival. The values of the characteristics studied indicated good acclimatization <b>of</b> the <b>arnica</b> ecotype to the climatic conditions of eastern Poland. Practical implications from the data presented here include the possibility of using the presented modes <b>of</b> <b>arnica</b> propagation and introduction in the short- and long-term perspective <b>of</b> <b>arnica</b> cultivation, which can give a possibility of better adjustment of raw material production...|$|R

The animals were treated topically with a daily single dose of the preparation for 28 days. Subsequently, the healing process was monitored by recording the lesion size in intervals of 15 days up to day 90. As a result, Arnica tincture fully cured three out of five hamsters while one animal showed an improvement and another one suffered from a relapse. This result was slightly better than that obtained with the positive control, meglumine antimonate, which cured two of five hamsters while the other three showed a relapse after 90 days.

The aim of the work was to determine the pattern and length of flowering of two- and three-year-old plants under field cultivation conditions with successive flower head collection. The flowering <b>of</b> <b>Arnica</b> montana in both years of study lasted 26 days (from the 28 th of May to the 22 nd of June). In this period, eight collections of flower heads were made. When analyzing the number of inflorescences gathered during particular collections, it was concluded that at the initial stage of flowering it was not great, but it successively increased {{with the passage of time}} up to the seventh collection. The pattern of flowering of the two- and three-year-old Arnica montana plants was similar. The inflorescences <b>of</b> <b>Arnica</b> chamissonis were collected six times, and the most abundant flowering was found in the middle period of this stage, which lasted 20 days...|$|R

2500|$|The {{differences}} between <b>Tincture</b> <b>of</b> Opium (Laudanum) and Camphorated <b>Tincture</b> <b>of</b> Opium (Paregoric) {{are important and}} {{should be kept in}} mind when administering either of these drugs. Care and caution should always be taken in administering doses <b>of</b> <b>Tincture</b> <b>of</b> Opium, {{such as the use of}} a dosage syringe or other suitable measurement device, and by pharmacists in preparing Paregoric from Laudanum, and to note that the dosages in this article refer to Apothecaries weight and fluid measure. In particular, [...] "the difference between a minim and a drop should be borne in mind when figuring doses. A minim is always a sixtieth part of a fluidrachm regardless of the character of the substance, while a drop varies from a forty-fifth to a two-hundred-and-fiftieth part, according to the surface tension of the fluid." [...] <b>Tincture</b> <b>of</b> Opium (Laudanum) and Camphorated <b>Tincture</b> <b>of</b> Opium (Paregoric) each have 50.9 drops per gram; 50.0 drops per cc; 185.0 drops per fluid drachm; and 3.10 drops per minim." [...] The importance of these distinctions is evident in view of the dangers of erroneously relying upon more general descriptions of Apothecaries' fluid measures, which typically list 60 minims per fluid dram, and 8 fluid drams per fluid ounce (480 minims).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Background :Â  Topical {{treatments}} such as Arnica {{cream and}} mucopolysaccharide polysulfuric acid (contained in HirudoidÂ cream) {{have been used}} to treat the bruising and pain arising from dialysis-related infiltrations. Aim:Â  To undertake a randomised controlled pilot study comparing the efficacy <b>of</b> <b>Arnica</b> and Hirudoid creams in treatingÂ bruising and pain following post-needling infiltration. Methods:Â  One dialysis centre of 40 patients over a 12 -month period. Following infiltration, and at the five subsequent dialysisÂ treatments, pain was measured using the Abbey pain scale and size of the bruise was recorded. Results:Â  Eleven cases of infiltration were recorded consisting of seven males (64 %) and four females (36 %) who had a mean ageÂ of 78 years (SD= 9). Access for eight patients was via arteriovenous fistula and for three patients via arteriovenous graft. EightÂ patients experienced bruising and two patients reported mild pain post-infiltration but there were no differences found betweenÂ the effect <b>of</b> <b>Arnica</b> or Hirudoid in treating either symptom. Conclusion:Â  This pilot study was unable to detect any differences in the effect <b>of</b> <b>Arnica</b> and Hirudoid on pain or bruising. TheÂ study demonstrated that a larger, multicentre trial would be required to power a study and that a non-interventional controlÂ group should be added. </div...|$|R
