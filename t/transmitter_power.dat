5|$|An initial {{prototype}} design was developed between January and May 1964. When used with MAR, the MSR needed only short range, enough to hand off the Sprint missiles. This {{led to a}} design with limited radiated power. For Small City Defense, this would not offer enough power to acquire the warheads at reasonable range. This led to an upgraded design with five times the <b>transmitter</b> <b>power,</b> which was sent to Raytheon in May 1965. A further upgrade in May 1966 included the battle control computers and other features for the SCD system.|$|E
5|$|Some {{international}} broadcasters {{have turned}} to a digital mode of broadcasting called Digital Radio Mondiale for their shortwave outlets. One reason is that digital shortwave broadcasts using DRM can cover the same geographic region with much less <b>transmitter</b> <b>power</b> — roughly one-fifth the power — than traditional AM mode broadcasts, significantly reducing the electricity cost of operating a station. A traditional AM (analog) international shortwave station can have a power rating of 50 kilowatts {{to as much as}} one million watts per transmitter, with typical power levels in the 50–500 kilowatt range. Endorsed by the ITU, it has been approved as an international standard for digital broadcasts on the HF (shortwave) bands. A DRM broadcast rivals FM mono quality and can also send graphic images and web pages via a separate information channel.|$|E

50|$|The station {{broadcasts}} on 102.4 FM from a <b>transmitter</b> <b>powered</b> by a wind-up generator at Billinge Hill on {{the border}} of Wigan and St. Helens and has been on air since 1 April 1997.|$|R
25|$|Handheld radios contain all the {{necessary}} equipment for radiocommunications with another station. A typical radio used as a handheld station integrates a transceiver with an antenna and a battery in one handheld package. Most handheld transceivers used in amateur radio are designed for operation on the VHF or UHF amateur radio bands and most often are capable of only FM voice communications transmissions. To conserve battery power, they have limited <b>transmitter</b> <b>power,</b> often below 1W, to cover a local range of typically a few km or miles.|$|E
25|$|However, {{due to its}} antenna location, its signal {{could be}} {{received}} fairly well in the nearby areas of Monterey and Salinas. Taking advantage of this, KNTV sought and was granted the ABC affiliation for the Monterey Bay area in 1960, {{on the condition that}} the station reduced its <b>transmitter</b> <b>power</b> so as not to overlap with network-owned KGO-TV's signal. Previously, all three networks had been shoehorned onto Salinas-based KSBW-TV (channel 8). KNTV, therefore, became one of the few stations located outside the market it served.|$|E
25|$|The station {{commenced}} {{operations on}} August 8, 1960, as an FM rebroadcast of an AM station, CHIC. On September 21, 1962 two brothers, Leslie and Harry Allen Jr., agreed to purchase all shares of CHIC Radio Ltd. from S.W. Caldwell, Frank M. Early, F.J. Shouldice, John Fox, W.S. Martin, Frank W. Richardson, Garth H. Ketemer, G. Clare Burt, J.R. Jenkins and Gordon F. Keeble. The sale occurred on October 15 {{later that year}} and was subject to Government approval. They began playing album rock music in the evenings while simulcasting the AM programming during the day. The nearby Humber College provided {{a steady stream of}} young employees, who were encouraged to play their own selections. Noted Canadian radio and television personality Vicki Gabereau was one of such employees. At this point in the station's existence, it operated under the call letters CHIC-FM, with a <b>transmitter</b> <b>power</b> of 857 watts ERP mono. This was just enough to just service the town of Brampton.|$|E
50|$|In October 1940, {{the station}} began to {{transmit}} the European Service on 1050 kHz. This also used a horizontally-polarised antenna. The <b>transmitter's</b> <b>power</b> was increased to 180 kW, with a consequent increase in audio distortion.|$|R
50|$|When the BBC {{first began}} {{transmissions}} on 14 November 1922, {{the technology for}} both national coverage and joint programming between transmitters did not exist - <b>transmitter</b> <b>powers</b> were generally {{in the region of}} 1 kilowatt (kW).|$|R
50|$|There {{was also}} a back-up {{omni-directional}} mast radiator for 648 kHz (erected in 1983), which could only handle <b>transmitter</b> <b>powers</b> of up to 250 kW and was only used when maintenance work was being carried out on the directional antenna.|$|R
25|$|Another {{improvement}} over standard AM is obtained through reduction or {{suppression of the}} carrier component of the modulated spectrum. In Figure 2 this is the spike in between the sidebands; even with full (100%) sine wave modulation, the power in the carrier component is twice that in the sidebands, yet it carries no unique information. Thus {{there is a great}} advantage in efficiency in reducing or totally suppressing the carrier, either in conjunction with elimination of one sideband (single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission) or with both sidebands remaining (double sideband suppressed carrier). While these suppressed carrier transmissions are efficient in terms of <b>transmitter</b> <b>power,</b> they require more sophisticated receivers employing synchronous detection and regeneration of the carrier frequency. For that reason, standard AM continues to be widely used, especially in broadcast transmission, to allow for the use of inexpensive receivers using envelope detection. Even (analog) television, with a (largely) suppressed lower sideband, includes sufficient carrier power for use of envelope detection. But for communications systems where both transmitters and receivers can be optimized, suppression of both one sideband and the carrier represent a net advantage and are frequently employed.|$|E
500|$|When Italian DVB-T {{broadcasting}} {{started in}} December 2010 interference {{was observed in}} northwest parts of Istria, and later in areas around Zadar and Šibenik. The interference {{was caused by the}} use of frequencies assigned to Croatia by Italian transmitters and excessive <b>transmitter</b> <b>power.</b> A complaint was filed by the Croatian regulator of the DVB-T market, the Croatian Regulatory Authority for Network Industries (HAKOM), with the Italian authorities. OIV installed additional transmitters in the affected areas to strengthen its signal coverage and reduce interference by February 2011 at a cost of 1million kuna ( [...] 133,000 euros). Although Italian Minister of Economic Development Paolo Romani announced in August 2011 that the problems should be resolved shortly (a transmitter causing interference was shut down and the power of several others was reduced), the situation was not completely resolved throughout 2011 and the International Telecommunication Union's Radio Regulations Board became involved in the process. In the meantime, other technical solutions were devised and implemented (in addition to the emergency transmitters) in order to improve digital-television-signal reception.|$|E
2500|$|In radio communications, single-sideband {{modulation}} (SSB) or single-sideband suppressed-carrier modulation (SSB-SC) {{is a type}} of modulation, used {{to transmit}} information, an audio signal, by radio waves. [...] It is a refinement of amplitude modulation which uses <b>transmitter</b> <b>power</b> and bandwidth more efficiently. Amplitude modulation produces an output signal that has twice the bandwidth of the original baseband signal. Single-sideband modulation avoids this bandwidth doubling, and the power wasted on a carrier, at the cost of increased device complexity and more difficult tuning at the receiver.|$|E
50|$|A 10 mW <b>transmitter,</b> <b>powered</b> by a mercury battery, on the 108 MHz band {{used for}} International Geophysical Year (IGY) {{scientific}} satellites, and a 5 mW, 108.03 MHz <b>transmitter</b> <b>powered</b> by six solar cells {{were used as}} part of a radio phase-comparison angle-tracking system. The tracking data were used to show that the shape of the Earth has a very slight north-south asymmetry, occasionally described as pear-shaped with the stem at the North Pole. These radio signals were also used to determine the total electron content between the satellite and selected ground-receiving stations. The battery-powered transmitter provided internal package temperature for about sixteen days and sent tracking signals for twenty days. The solar cell <b>powered</b> <b>transmitter</b> operated for more than six years. Signals gradually weakened and were last received at Quito, Ecuador in May 1964 after which the spacecraft was optically tracked from Earth.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, radio connections, which used Morse Code, were only land transmissions. The {{techniques}} to amplify signals upon reception were still unknown, so the maximum distance at which messages could be detected depended entirely upon the <b>transmitter's</b> <b>power.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Ranging with an FM-CW radar system: if {{the error}} {{caused by a}} {{possible}} Doppler frequency [...] can be ignored and the <b>transmitter's</b> <b>power</b> is linearly frequency modulated, then the time delay (...) {{is proportional to the}} difference of the transmitted and the received signal (...) at any time.|$|R
2500|$|As {{a result}} of skywave propagation, a signal from a distant AM {{broadcasting}} station, a shortwave station, or—during sporadic E propagation conditions (principally {{during the summer months}} in both hemispheres) a distant VHF FM or TV station can sometimes be received as clearly as local stations. [...] Most long-distance shortwave (high frequency) radio communication—between 3 and 30MHz—is {{a result of}} skywave propagation. Since the early 1920s amateur radio operators (or [...] "hams"), limited to lower <b>transmitter</b> <b>power</b> than broadcast stations, have taken advantage of skywave for long distance (or [...] "DX") communication.|$|E
2500|$|In AM broadcasting, the {{dramatic}} ionospheric {{changes that occur}} overnight in the mediumwave band drive a unique broadcast license scheme, with entirely different <b>transmitter</b> <b>power</b> output levels and directional antenna patterns to cope with skywave propagation at night. [...] Very few stations are allowed to run without modifications during dark hours, typically only those on clear channels in North America. [...] Many stations have no authorization to run at all outside of daylight hours. [...] Otherwise, {{there would be nothing}} but interference on the entire broadcast band from dusk until dawn without these modifications.|$|E
2500|$|One {{disadvantage}} of all amplitude modulation techniques (not only standard AM) {{is that the}} receiver amplifies and detects noise and electromagnetic interference in equal proportion to the signal. Increasing the received signal-to-noise ratio, say, {{by a factor of}} 10 (a 10 decibel improvement), thus would require increasing the <b>transmitter</b> <b>power</b> by a factor of 10. This is in contrast to [...] frequency modulation (FM) and digital radio where the effect of such noise following demodulation is strongly reduced so long as the received signal is well above the threshold for reception. For this reason AM broadcast is not favored for music and high fidelity broadcasting, but rather for voice communications and broadcasts (sports, news, talk radio etc.).|$|E
50|$|The state's main {{radio station}} was Hrvatski Krugoval, known {{before the war}} as Radio Zagreb. The NDH {{increased}} the <b>transmitter's</b> <b>power</b> to 10 kW.

50|$|WKTA (1330 AM) is a {{radio station}} {{broadcasting}} Multicultural ethnic and News Talk formats. Licensed to Evanston, Illinois, United States, the station serves the Chicago area.

5000|$|The payload of the TV3 {{was very}} similar to the later Vanguard 1. It was a small {{aluminium}} sphere, 15.2 cm in diameter and with a mass of 1.36 kg.

Using six small aerial antennae mounted on its body, the satellite primarily transmitted engineering and telemetry data, but the transmitters were also used to determine the total electron content between the satellite and the ground stations. Other instruments in the satellite's design included two thermistors, which were used to measure the satellite's internal temperatures for the purpose of tracking its thermal protection's effectiveness. Although the satellite was damaged beyond reuse capability during the crash, it was still intact and transmitting after the incident.|$|R
2500|$|XERA: In September 1935 Brinkley {{gained a}} new license for Villa Acuña from the Government of Mexico with new call letters of XERA. His new {{operating}} company was Cía Mexicana Radiodifusora Fronteriza and the station {{came on the}} air from the same location as the old XER but with a directional antenna. His new <b>transmitter</b> <b>power</b> was 500 kW, but with his new antenna he claimed an output of 1MW. [...] XERA called itself [...] "the world's most powerful broadcasting station" [...] and Variety magazine claimed {{that it could be}} heard in New York City. Following the signing of various treaties, the Government of Mexico revoked the license of XERA in the closing days of 1939.|$|E
2500|$|WMAQ {{came to life}} as WGU on April 13, 1922. The {{station was}} formed as {{a joint venture between}} The Fair Department Store and the Chicago Daily News, with the station's first {{transmitter}} atop the department store. At the time, the station was broadcasting on 833 kilocycles with a <b>transmitter</b> <b>power</b> of about 100 watts. [...] There are questions as to whether anyone actually was able to hear the station's initial half-hour broadcast, as technical problems forced the station to shut down the following day and it remained off the air while a new ordered transmitter was awaited. One of the problems with reception of the station was the interference of other tall buildings in the area {{and the fact that it}} had only about 100 watts of power.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{disadvantage}} of AM {{is that it}} is inefficient in power usage; at least two-thirds of the power is concentrated in the carrier signal. [...] The carrier signal contains none of the original information being transmitted (voice, video, data, etc.). [...] However its presence provides a simple means of demodulation using envelope detection, providing a frequency and phase reference to extract the modulation from the sidebands. [...] In some modulation systems based on AM, a lower <b>transmitter</b> <b>power</b> is required through partial or total elimination of the carrier component, however receivers for these signals are more complex and costly. The receiver may regenerate a copy of the carrier frequency (usually as shifted to the intermediate frequency) from a greatly reduced [...] "pilot" [...] carrier (in reduced-carrier transmission or DSB-RC) to use in the demodulation process. Even with the carrier totally eliminated in double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission, carrier regeneration is possible using a Costas phase-locked loop. This doesn't work however for single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission (SSB-SC), leading to the characteristic [...] "Donald Duck" [...] sound from such receivers when slightly detuned. Single sideband is nevertheless used widely in amateur radio and other voice communications both due to its power efficiency and bandwidth efficiency (cutting the RF bandwidth in half compared to standard AM). On the other hand, in medium wave and short wave broadcasting, standard AM with the full carrier allows for reception using inexpensive receivers. The broadcaster absorbs the extra power cost to greatly increase potential audience.|$|E

2500|$|The {{amplitude}} of random noise is not {{changed by the}} compression process, so the signal to noise ratios of received chirp signals are increased in the process. [...] In {{the case of a}} high power search radars, this extends the range performance of the system, while for stealth systems the property will permit lower <b>transmitter</b> <b>powers</b> to be used.|$|R
