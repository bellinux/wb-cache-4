40|$|The Elementary {{students}} {{of a certain}} public school in Surabaya had difficulties in learning English. One of the crucial problems was learning English vocabulary. In attempts to help the students learn and master the English vocabulary, the researcher decided to use CAR to teach English vocabulary with local cultural content materials. The aim ofthis {{study was to investigate}} how the teaching of English vocabulary with local cultural content materials could contribute to the improvement ofthe students' English vocabulary mastery. The topics of the learning materials were selected based on Second Language Acquisition theory; the input hypothesis (i+ 1) claims that schema is the most appropriate comprehensible input. The two principles of schemata - connections and prerequisite knowledge - were used to develop the lessons to help the students learn and understand the English vocabul ary. The topics covered in the materials are the students ' personal lives and the students' surroundings. The activities consisting of brainstorming, role pl aying, doing illustrations and visual aids, reading passages, explaining meanings of new English words, doing exercises and worksheets were connected to the students' schemata. The CAR was conducted in three cycles spanning about six months, with four topics covered in each cycle. The lessons were observed by an English teacher and all classroom activities were noted in the observation sheet. Triangulation was done through interview to the students, the observer and document analysis. The vocabulary tests were administered for each cycle with overall assessment of all the lessons done at the end of all cycles. The results show ed that the teaching of local cultural content materials in English vocabulary learning contributed to the improvement of the students' vocabulary mastery with different degree. Students who were familiar with the topics could respond the teaching more enthusiastically and improve their vocabulary mastery better than those who were not familiar with the topics. It was also found that the highest gain scores were obtained by the students who participated in both classroom and outsid e vocabulary learning. The success of the lessons was mostly due to the classroom vocabulary learning, especially 'brainstormin g' and outside vocabulary learning through 'worksheet' which were absent in previous English vocabulary learning materials. In addition, the teacher 's ability to respond the students' ideas during the brainstorming activity was also claimed to be critical to make the lessons successful. <b>To</b> <b>conclud</b> <b>e,</b> the teaching of local cultural content materials have contribut ed to the improvement of the Elementary students' vocabulary mastery in varying degree depending on the students' familiarity with the topics and on the students' participation in both classroom and outside vocabulary learning process. Perhaps future studies could be carried out in a more experim ental manner to quantify {{the results of this study}} or to implement other CAR type of research on other cultural aspe cts...|$|E
40|$|Em razão das poucas de informações existente na literatura, sobre a mobilidade do {{glyphosate}} e do imazapyr, em solos de baixa atividade, comum em países tropicais, foi conduzido, em laboratório, um estudo sobre a mobilidade vertical desses herbicida s em dois solos com diferente s composições químicas e fisicas. Para estudar essa mobilidade, foram utilizadas colunas de solo com diferentes alturas, as quais, após aplicação dos produtos na dose comerc ial de 4 L ha- 1, foram submetida s a um regime hídrico de 40 mm h- 1, por um período de 4 h. As análises dos resíduos nas diferentes profundidades foram feitas utilizando-se os métodos voltamétrico (polarografia) e HPLC, para o glyphosate e imazapyr, respectivame nte. Com base nos resultados, foi possível concluir que: a) os métodos voltamétrico, para o glyphosate, e HPLC, para o imazapyr, são adequados para os estudos de identificação e quantificação de resíduos em água e solo; b) os limites de quantificação dos resíduos foram de 0, 4 &# 956;g mL- 1 e 5 &# 956;g L- 1 para o glyphosate e o imazapyr, respectivamente; c) a taxa de recuperação do glyphosate, nas amostr as de solo (76 e 78 % para os solos de Viçosa e Sabará, respectivamente) foi menor que na amostra de água (83 %); d) a taxa de recuperação do imazapyr, em água e solo, foi próxima de 100 %; e) a lixiviação do glyphosate nos solos foi muito baixa; e f) o imazapyr apresentou alta lix iviação, porém dif ere nciada entre os solos estudados, sendo essa maior no solo de tex tura franco -are nosa de Viçosa que no de argila de Sabará. Due to the scarce {{information available}} in the lit eratu re on the glyphosa te and imazapyr mobility in low activity soils, which is common in the tropical countries, a laboratory study {{was conducted on the}} vertical mobility of these herbicides in two soils with different physical and chemical compositions. For studying this mobility, the soil columns with different heights were submitted to a water flux of 40 mm h- 1 over a 4 h period after the product applications in a commer ci al d os ag e of 4 L ha - 1.

40|$|The North China Seismic Region is not {{a typical}} intraplate seismic region. Not only does it show a {{pervasive}} neotectonic influence of global plate geodynam-ics, but it also displays an atypical seismic activity rate, especially for strong earthquakes, for a region far from plate boundaries. It {{is obvious that the}} seismicity is related to the active seismotectonics and geodynamics of the deforming interior of a continental plate. The features of the seismotectonic zones and the tectonic setting of magnitude 6. 0 or greater earthquakes in the region are discussed here. We <b>conclud</b> <b>e</b> that strong earthquakes occur mainly in places where NE-trending main and NW-trending auxiliary tectonic zones intersect. Three types of mechanisms are suggested which differ according to the characteristics of different seismotectonic zones and which relate to different shallow and deep structures. These observed types of strong earthquakes in North China may represent the main categories of con-tinental intraplate seismicity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Despite {{the effects}} of the {{diffusion}} of In-formation and Communication Technologies (ICT) on socio-economic changes that are not yet fully identi-fied, it is now recognized that ICT alter substantially our ways of communicating, learning and producing. In addition to this, the controversy, that gave rise to the concept of ”information-society”, embodies these developments which foreshadow new forms of social or-ganization structured around computer networks and telecommunications. ICT increasingly aware of the de-velopments identified, and are introduced in all sectors. This use has made these technological tools a require-ment for all countries which is likely to help them face up to the challenges ahead. In recent years our country ”Morocco ” has embarked on an ambitious program for the widespread use of ICT integration in the System of Education and Training. In this paper, we propose a strategy to follow in teaching students specific sub-jects and a training program for teachers both at the Faculties of Humanities as well as at that of the socio-economic studies; the ultimate purpose being to achieve the integration of ICT in the Moroccan Educational System and Scientific research in general. <b>To</b> <b>conclud...</b>|$|R
40|$|Summarn Clinical {{decision}} making is based on results from qualitative and quantitative information. To provide quantitative data, various laboratory variables are widely used in the clinical evaluation of patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). The tumour marker serum neuron-specific enolase (S-NSE) and the routine laboratory parameter serum lactate dehydrogenase (S-LDH) have been investigated, mostly separately. Few studies have compared their importance in SCLC, especially in progressive disease (PD). The present investigation was undertaken to evaluate S-NSE for diagnostic efficacy in PD and compare it with S-LDH. In 27 patients in a treatment trial of SCLC, regular follow-up laboratory values were prospectively obtained. Chemotherapy was given according to trial protocols, and all clinical evaluation followed the WHO recom-mendations. At re-evaluation all but three values had normalised (two S-NSE. one S-LDH). S-NSE at progression was increased in 93 % of the patients and S-LDH in 590 *. The efficacy of S-NSE to discriminate between response and PD was superior to S-LDH (0. 92 vs 0. 70). There was no additive effect of the two parameters in prediction of PD. and the discriminating power was higher for S-NSE than for S-LDH (P< 0. 0008). The disease status-related marker increments in relation to upper reference limits. i. e. the signal-noise relation, were higher for S-NSE than for S-LD. Both of the markers carry information on PD. S-NSE is. however, clearly superior to S-LDH in reflecting disease status during therapy. This prompts us <b>to</b> <b>conclud...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Two intuitions lie at {{the heart}} of our {{conception}} of free will. One intuition locates free will in our ability to deliberate effectively and control our actions accordingly: the ÔDeliberation and ControlÕ (DC) condition. The other intuition is that free will requires the existence of alternative possibilities for choice: the AP condition. These intuitions seem to conflict when, for instance, we deliberate well to decide what to do, and we do not want it to be possible to act in some other way. I suggest that intuitions about the AP condition arise when we face Ôclose calls,Õ situations in which, after deliberating, we still do not know what we really want to do. Indeed, several incompatibilists suggest such close calls are necessary for free will. I challenge this suggestion by describing a Ôconfident agentÕ who, after deliberating, always feels confident about what to do (and can then control her actions accordingly). Because she maximally satisfies the DC condition, she does not face close calls, and the intuition that the AP condition is essential for free will does not seem to apply <b>to</b> her.
