5|$|During the retreat, Montcalm, still mounted, {{was struck}} by either {{canister}} shot from the British artillery or repeated musket fire, suffering injuries to the lower abdomen and thigh. He was able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> into the city, but his wounds were mortal and he died early the next morning. He was buried in a shell crater left in {{the floor of the}} Ursuline chapel by a British shell.

5|$|Sevastopol saw {{service in}} the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05. Slightly damaged during a {{surprise}} attack on Port Arthur in early February, the ship later participated in several attempts to break out from the besieged port. The most notable of these was the Battle of the Yellow Sea, where she was damaged by several shells but managed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to port with {{the remnants of the}} Russian Fleet, leaving one crewman dead and 62 wounded. Immediately after the surrender of Port Arthur, Sevastopol was scuttled to prevent her capture by the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Japanese never raised her. The remains of the ship still lie outside the entrance to the port.|$|E
5|$|The player picks one of {{the three}} {{brothers}} to play as; Pixie can also be unlocked as a playable character. They traverse six areas within a time limit <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to the fairy world in time. The areas all consist of a number of floors; the player needs to collect all keys on each floor, before being allowed to jump down to a lower floor. To find the keys, the player uses a radar that displays their locations; once all have been collected, it shows the location of the exit. Once the player reaches the bottom floor, they are faced with a boss character they need to defeat, after which they can proceed to the next area.|$|E
5|$|Cotes' {{ship was}} fit only to sail with the wind, {{and the captain}} urged his men to make greater efforts to repair their ship before Uranie {{could come up with}} them again. So engrossed was the British crew with their repairs that it was not until 16:00 that it was {{realised}} that the French frigate was no longer holding station within sight, and had completely disappeared. This led some on the British ship to assume that Uranie had sunk, although in fact the ship had simply turned away in an effort <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to Rochefort to repair the damage suffered in the engagement. Also apparent were a number of sails in the distance. These rapidly approached and were revealed to be a frigate squadron flying the Union Flag. Cotes was unable to manoeuvre his ship or respond to the new arrivals, which were soon identified as French vessels wearing false flags. The leading frigate pulled up close to Thames and fired a broadside at the British frigate. Cotes immediately hailed the French, announcing that he was in no position to fight them due to the damage his ship had suffered and that he was striking his flag.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} a Falls Count Anywhere match between Randy Savage and Crush. The rules stated that any time a wrestler was pinned, he then had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> inside the ring within sixty seconds {{or he would}} lose the match. Savage tried to attack Crush before the bell rang, but Crush {{reversed}} the attack. He used a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker to injure Savage and then dropped Savage across the guard rail to get the first pinfall. While Savage was returning to the ring, Mr. Fuji hit him with the Japanese flag to stall him. Savage {{made it back to}} the ring with two seconds remaining, so the match continued. Inside the ring, Crush tried to throw salt in Savage's eyes, but Savage countered by throwing the salt in Crush's eyes. Savage then performed a diving elbow drop and rolled Crush outside of the ring for the pinfall. Fuji helped revive Crush, which allowed Crush to return to the ring before the count had expired. Savage and Crush then brawled down the aisle and into a room backstage. Savage scored a pinfall and tied Crush's legs to a pulley. Crush was left hanging upside down and could not return to the ring, so Savage was declared the winner.|$|E

While his regiment was stationed in Britain on training exercises, Beadles was a bugle boy. In 1915, his unit took part in the landing at Suvla Bay in Gallipoli where, despite still being under the minimum age, he served on the frontline as a rifleman. During this time, Beadles performed an action that would later see him awarded the Serbian Gold medal for gallantry. He received the honor for saving the life of a Serbian observer officer who had been wounded in no man's land and was unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to the line. Under heavy rifle and artillery fire, Beadles helped the officer back, having his cap and epaulettes shot off in the process but remaining unharmed.|$|E

The whole town shows up to show their respects at the funeral. Worried about Tipi's state of mind in dealing with the man's death, Rei {{repeatedly}} tries to go see Tipi, but Shiona keeps preventing him from going to see her. Rei eventually makes it to the library, but Shiona merely tells Tipi that her parents, who she has been waiting to return, are dead and that she will always be alone. Enraged at Shiona's behavior, Rei gets her to leave the library and Rei stays with Tipi overnight. Rei and Tipi wake up the next morning to find that the town is under attack. When Rei leaves to investigate, he finds humans have infiltrated the town and are killing the townspeople.

Jali has established himself {{as one of the most}} important players in the Orlando Pirates squad, winning several trophies at his time at the club. Partly due to his success with the Soweto side, he was touted as the future captain of the South African national team (Bafana Bafana).

5|$|Upon commissioning, {{the ship}} was {{assigned}} to the Fourth Carrier Division of the 1st Air Fleet, together with , under the command of Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta. She was tasked to support Operation AL, an attack planned to seize several Aleutian Islands to provide advance warning in case of an American attack from the Aleutians down the Kurile Islands while {{the main body of the}} American fleet was occupied defending Midway. Jun'yō carried 18 A6M2 Zeros and 18 D3As for this operation. At dawn on 3 June, she launched 9 Zeros and a dozen D3As to attack Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island. They had to turn back due to bad weather, although an American PBY Catalina reconnaissance aircraft was shot down by a Zero. A second airstrike was launched later in the day to attack a group of destroyers discovered by aircraft from the first attack, but they failed to find the targets. Another airstrike was launched on the following day by the two carriers that consisted of 15 Zeros, 11 D3As, and 6 B5Ns and successfully bombed Dutch Harbor. As the aircraft from Jun'yō were regrouping after the attack, they were attacked by 8 Curtiss P-40 fighters that shot down 2 Zeros and a pair of D3As while losing 2 of their own. Another D3A got lost and failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to the carrier. Shortly after the aircraft were launched, the Americans attacked the carriers, but failed to inflict any damage. A Martin B-26 Marauder bomber and a PBY were shot down by Zeros, and a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber was shot down by flak during the attack.|$|E

However, these plans were quickly dampened by the Trojans losing four of their last five games to finish at 7-5 and a second-place tie in the Pac-12 South Division.

40|$|The {{case of a}} 19 {{years old}} {{caucasian}} male, involved {{in a car accident}} and reporting an atypical posterior fracture-dislocation of the right proximal humerus is described. Classification of the fracture according to Neer's 4 fragments criteria, was not applicable even if a CT scan of the shoulder was obtained in the emergency room. The patient was taken to the operative room, the dislocation was easily reduced under general anaesthesia by means of gentle manual manoeuvres and an arthroscopy of the right shoulder was performed in the beach chair position. The arthroscopic gleno-humeral joint inspection revealed the morphology of the fracture, consisting of a proximal humerus fragment including the bicipital groove, part of the lesser tuberosity and a portion of the greater tuberosity. The reduction of the fragment was performed percutaneously by means of two 1. 5 mm K-wires employed as levers <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> slide <b>back</b> in the original distal position, under direct arthroscopic control Then, a 7 mm partially threaded cannulated screw was inserted in the greater tuberosity.
