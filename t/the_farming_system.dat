In some cases entire settlements were abandoned, and nearly 1,500 villages were lost during this period. Landowners also abandoned the system of direct management of their demesne lands, which had begun back in the 1180s, and turned instead to [...] "farming" [...] out large blocks of land for fixed money rents. Initially, livestock and land were rented out together under [...] "stock and lease" [...] contracts, but this {{was found to be}} increasingly impractical and contracts for farms became centred purely on land. Many of the rights to church parish tithes were also [...] "farmed" [...] out in exchange for fixed rents. This process was encouraged by the trend for tithe revenues being increasing [...] "appropriated" [...] by central church authorities, rather than being used to support local clergy: around 39% of parish tithes had been centralised in this way by 1535. As the major estates transformed, a new economic grouping, the gentry, became evident, many of them benefiting from the opportunities of <b>the</b> <b>farming</b> <b>system.</b> Land distribution remained heavily unequal; estimates suggest that the English nobility owned 20% of English lands, the Church and Crown 33%, the gentry 25%, and the remainder was owned by peasant farmers. Agriculture itself continued to innovate, and the loss of many English oxen to the murrain sickness in the crisis increased the number of horses used to plough fields in the 14th century, a significant improvement on older methods.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} High Nature Value (HNV) {{farmland}} has been evolving {{over the last}} fifteen years in Europe. In the European Union this has been closely linked to the aim of integrating environmental concerns in the Common Agricultural Policy. The idea that nature values, environmental qualities, even cultural heritage are linked to or dependent on farming, also underlies and supports the concept of a multifunctional 'European model of farming which provides benefits beyond food production. The objective {{of this study is to}} better identify and characterise HNV farmland at national level (the Walloon Region in Belgium) with a <b>Farm</b> <b>System</b> Approach based on FSS statistical data and specific national surveys, taking into account <b>the</b> whole <b>farm</b> with <b>the</b> total agricultural area and its characteristics. The methodology is built on two different approaches: the natural zones approach and <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> <b>system</b> approach. <b>The</b> natural zones approach uses spatial data to define agricultural zones with a verified high biodiversity interest, based on a reference biodiversity layer for the Walloon Region (WR) called the principal ecological structure (SEP). <b>The</b> <b>farm</b> <b>system</b> approach analyses <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> structure and <b>farming</b> practices on <b>the</b> basis of data available in the WR agricultural database. In the first step relevant variables have been selected to calculate the HNV indicators for <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> <b>system</b> approach at NUTS 5 level: 1) crop diversity and grassland presence, 2) extensive practices, and 3) landscape elements. In the second step the three indicators were combined to calculate the HNV score. In the third step the areas delimited through <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> <b>system</b> approach were overlaid with a map resulting form the natural zones approach. In the last step HNV farmland was analysed with regard to prevailing trends in farming practices and production types with the aim of identification of <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> which might be associated with HNV farmland occurrence in the WR in Belgium. The analysis of spatial distribution of HNV farmland delimited in the study shows that 91 % of <b>the</b> HNV <b>farm</b> <b>system</b> zone identified in the study is located in Ardenne, Fagne and Fammenne. <b>The</b> dominant <b>farming</b> <b>system</b> types are grazing livestock system specialised in milk or meat production, depending on the region. The average livestock density is less than 2. 0 LU/ha. Over 60 % of UAA is used as permanent grassland. The strength of <b>the</b> <b>Farm</b> <b>System</b> Approach methodology is the possibility of producing a map at the NUTS 5 level with an accurate description of <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>The</b> methodology can be improved by crosschecking the results with regional experts and getting feedback on the thresholds and the weighting of the indicators. The weaknesses of <b>the</b> <b>Farm</b> <b>System</b> Approach methodology are mainly due to the way agricultural practices are modelled. The lack of comprehensive and reliable data on landscape elements and grassland management hampers further validation of HNV farmland identification results. A development of additional relevant surveys is therefore recommended. An attempt at assessing the applicability of the FSA for HNV farmland identification was undertaken for the Czech Republic. Statistical data on farming practices are still incomplete and insufficient to build the methodology similar to the Walloon Region FSA. Conversely, biodiversity and habitat data are abundant and of high quality and currently are the best datasets for HNV farmland identification in the Czech Republic. JRC.
