5|$|King {{told the}} International Congress of Coptic Studies {{that the text}} does not prove that Jesus had a wife. She noted <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> a {{translation}} of a 2nd-century AD Greek text, it would still have been written more than 100 years {{after the death of}} Jesus. According to King, the earliest and most reliable information about Jesus is silent on the question of his marital status. King also said that the text (which she suggested is a fragment from a non-canonical gospel) showed that some early Christians believed that Jesus was married. A Harvard News Office article reported that King dated the speculative Greek original to {{the second half of the}} second century because it shows close connections to other newly discovered gospels written at that time, particularly the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Mary, and the Gospel of Philip.|$|E
25|$|This {{controversial}} tone lessened {{after the}} initial results reported a successful first month after Ecopass implementation. However, some doctors have complained <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> pollution level has been reduced, the improvement in air quality had been insufficient, and they are advocating for the pollution charge to be raised and the ZTL to be extended outwards.|$|E
25|$|Sometime before 1109 CE, the Palas {{of eastern}} India invaded the Gahadavala kingdom, {{probably}} as a retaliation for Chandradeva's earlier invasion of their kingdom. The 1109 CE Rahin inscription boasts <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> a prince, Govindachandra subdued the elephants of Gauda (the Pala kingdom). The Kṛtya-Kalpataru declares {{that the mere}} sport of Govindachandra threatened the elephants of Gauda.|$|E

25|$|Moynihan's {{research}} of Labor Department data demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> fewer people were unemployed, {{more people were}} joining the welfare rolls. These recipients were families with children but only one parent (almost invariably the mother). The laws at that time permitted such families to receive welfare payments {{in certain parts of}} the United States.|$|E
25|$|The poem {{allows the}} reader to {{experience}} this, her dying wish, in a very personal and powerful way as she entreats us to come in close {{and listen to what}} she has to say like a loved one and a confidence. Yet the reader is struck by the fact <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> we read her final request, we know it goes un-honored. This has a further social implication on the silencing of marginalized cultures and, additionally, women.|$|E
25|$|Featherston blames blacks, and the {{powerful}} families that control the country, largely via the Whig Party, for causing the Confederate States to lose the Great War. His rise in politics {{to the position of}} President of the Confederate States was spurred on by his dream of overthrowing the status quo, and solving race relations in the country once and for all. Featherston is so sure that blacks are a threat to the Confederacy <b>that,</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> the United States begins to win the war, he continues committing resources to the genocide against them.|$|E

25|$|If a cow had {{two black}} or white hairs growing within one follicle, it was invalid. Rabbi Judah said even within one hollow. If the hairs grew within two {{adjacent}} follicles, the cow was invalid. Rabbi Akiva ruled that {{even if there were}} four or even five non-red hairs, if they were dispersed, they could be plucked out. Rabbi Eliezer ruled <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> many as 50 such hairs could be plucked. But Rabbi Joshua ben Bathyra ruled that even if it had only one non-red hair on its head and one on its tail, it was invalid. If the cow had two hairs in one follicle with their roots black and their tips red or with their roots red and their tips black, Rabbi Meir taught that what was visible determined validity; but the Sages ruled that validity followed the root.|$|E
25|$|The {{convergence}} of content, technology, and broadband access allows consumers to stream television shows and movies to their high-definition television {{in competition with}} traditional service providers (Cable TV and Satellite Television). The research company SNL Kagan expects 12 million households, roughly 10%, to go without cable, satellite or telco video service by 2015 using Over The Top services. This represents a new trend in the broadcast television industry, as the list of options for watching movies and TV over the Internet grows every day. Research also shows <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> traditional television service providers are trimming their customer base, they are adding Broadband Internet customers. Nearly 76.6 million U.S. households get broadband from leading cable and telephone companies, although only a portion have sufficient speeds to support quality video streaming. Convergence devices for home entertainment will likely play a much larger role {{in the future of}} broadcast television, effectively shifting traditional revenue streams while providing consumers with more options.|$|E
25|$|Lacking a {{technological}} base at first, the Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain, but quickly learned {{the skills needed}} to operate and expand the railways. In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. Observers found <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> late as 1890, their engineering was inferior to Britain’s. However, German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies and further rapid growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was support of industrialisation and so heavy lines crisscrossed the Ruhr and other industrial districts and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen. By 1880, Germany had 9,400 locomotives pulling 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight a day and forged ahead of France.|$|E

25|$|Aristotle in 350 BC in his Historia Animalium {{noted the}} habit of bird migration, moulting, egg laying and life spans, as well as {{compiling}} a list of 170 different bird species. However, he also introduced and propagated several myths, such as the idea that swallows hibernated in winter, although he noted that cranes migrated from the steppes of Scythia to the marshes at {{the headwaters of the}} Nile. The idea of swallow hibernation became so well established <b>that,</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> late as in 1878, Elliott Coues could list as many as 182 contemporary publications dealing with the hibernation of swallows and little published evidence to contradict the theory. Similar misconceptions existed regarding the breeding of barnacle geese. Their nests had not been seen and it was believed that they grew by transformations of goose barnacles, an idea that became prevalent from around the 11th century and noted by Bishop Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald of Wales) in Topographia Hiberniae (1187). Around 77 AD, Pliny the Elder described birds, among other creatures, in his Historia Naturalis.|$|E
500|$|Other {{observers}} see Satin as {{an emotionally}} wounded figure. For example, historian Pierre Berton calls him a [...] "footloose wanderer" [...] {{and says he}} hitchhiked across Canada 16 times. [...] Culture critic Annie Gottlieb, who attributes Satin's wounds to his struggle against the Vietnam War, points out <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> a successful newsletter publisher in Washington, DC, he paid himself the salary of a monk.|$|E
500|$|The Orb {{have often}} been {{described}} as [...] "The Pink Floyd of the Nineties", but Paterson has stated that their music is more influenced by experimental electronic music than progressive rock of the 1970s. He has noted though that the Pink Floyd album Meddle was influential {{to him as a}} child in the 1970s. The psychedelic prog-rock similarities have led critics to describe the Orb as hippie revivalists; Paterson has strongly rejected the tag, claiming <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> a youth, he was [...] "one of those punks who hated hippies".|$|E

500|$|Shostakovich was in {{many ways}} an obsessive man: {{according}} to his daughter he was [...] "obsessed with cleanliness". He synchronised the clocks in his apartment and regularly sent cards to himself to test how well the postal service was working. Elizabeth Wilson's Shostakovich: A Life Remembered (1994 edition) indexes 26 references to his nervousness. Mikhail Druskin remembers <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> a young man the composer was [...] "fragile and nervously agile". [...] Yuri Lyubimov comments, [...] "The fact that he was more vulnerable and receptive than other people was no doubt an important feature of his genius." [...] In later life, Krzysztof Meyer recalled, [...] "his face was a bag of tics and grimaces." ...|$|E
500|$|According to her biographer Julia Philips, Montalban {{had been}} {{described}} by her magical students as [...] "tempestuous, generous, humorous, demanding, kind, capricious, talented, volatile, selfish, goodhearted, [...] dramatic". Philips noted {{that she was a}} woman who made a [...] "definite impression" [...] in all those whom she encountered, but who equally could be quite shy and disliked being interviewed in anything other than print. Philips asserted that Montalban had a [...] "mercurial personality" [...] and could be kind and generous at one moment and fly into a violent temper the next. Several of her friends noted that she was prudish when it came to sexual matters, and her friend Maxine Sanders stated <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> an elderly lady Montalban boasted of only taking men under the age of twenty-five as her lovers. She would take great pleasure in causing arguments, particularly between a couple who were romantically involved.|$|E
500|$|Regarding her {{personality}} issues, sometimes perceived as complicated, Sniper Wolf was ranked as the 25th top [...] "chick behaving badly" [...] in all entertainment by IGN's Scott Collura in 2008, featured {{as one of}} nine [...] "bad girls of videogame land" [...] by Gelo Gonzales of FHM in 2009, and ranked as the seventh top [...] "bitch in games" [...] by Gavin Mackenzie of PLAY in 2010. Complex ranked her as the ninth [...] "most diabolical video game she-villain" [...] in 2011, describing her as [...] "the exact type of woman that you wouldn’t marry for any rational reason." [...] In 2012, Complex ranked her as ninth {{on the list of}} some of the most evil women in video games, commenting <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> Sniper Wolf [...] "actually ends up being one of the more noble villains in the game," [...] she did exhibit [...] "some next-level psycho behavior." ...|$|E

500|$|For evidence, Röhl {{reviewed}} letters between Charlotte and her doctor, {{as well as}} {{correspondence with}} her parents, that had been sent over a 25-year period; he found <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> a little girl, Charlotte had suffered from hyperactivity and indigestion. As a young woman, Charlotte became gravely ill with what her mother called [...] "malaria poisoning and anaemia" [...] followed by [...] "neuralgia, fainting and nausea", all described by Röhl as a [...] "textbook list of the symptoms of porphyria, and this several decades before the disorder was clinically identified". Röhl also notes further symptoms described in letters between Charlotte and her physician Ernst Schweninger, who treated her for over two decades {{beginning in the early}} 1890s; in them, Charlotte variously complains of [...] "toothache, backache, insomnia, dizzy spells, nausea, constipation, excruciating 'wandering' abdominal pains, skin oedema and itching, partial paralysis of the legs and dark red or orange urine", the last of which Röhl calls the [...] "decisive diagnostic symptom".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} for {{the plot of}} Outlaw Star has been mixed. Churosh found that though the series features many clichés of 1990's science fiction anime, Outlaw Star manages to transcend them as well. [...] "Maybe it doesn't go anywhere that other series haven't already been", the reviewer stated. [...] "But boy, {{does it have a}} damn good time getting there." [...] Upatkoon observed that the plot [...] " [...] off with a bang at the beginning" [...] and then begins to drag. Keith Dawe of Animerica also noted this about the anime's pacing, stating <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> the first few episodes do well to begin the narrative, the show's writers rely too heavily on inertia to advance it. He went on to remark that the series suffers from [...] "unfocused scripting" [...] and that [...] "one has to endure the occasional cheesy episode to reap the rewards of a show that is clever, pragmatic and amusing". However, Dawe did regard the English script writing and voice acting, and called the over-the-top introductory narration for each episode a reminder that the show should be enjoyed for what it was. Owens commented that the plot will not seem very original, but that it does seem to have direction, despite said direction not being very clear.|$|E
500|$|Mark Bozon of IGN {{was highly}} {{critical}} of the game's dated graphics, found the overall gameplay very slow, and found the garbled voice work unsettling while enjoying the soundtrack. He concluded <b>that,</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> a fan of old school and abstract gameplay design, he had not enjoyed his time with the game. Lark Anderson, writing for GameSpot said there was [...] "never a dull moment" [...] due to the eccentric cast and story, and found the puzzle elements to be an entertaining challenge. His main complaints were the poor graphics, unresponsive camera system, lack of direction during navigation and the constant need for backtracking. Nintendo World Report's Nick DiMola noted the dialogue for its humor, but generally faulted most other aspects of the game; he called its graphics and sound low-quality, felt the gameplay was shallow, and found the puzzle solving segments a chore. He found it hard to recommend the title for any but dedicated fans of Suda's work. PALGN reviewer Ben Chev called the script [...] "well-written in what {{can only be described as}} a typical Suda 51 style", and praised the music for its unique take on classical music. However he generally faulted the gameplay and called the graphics the worst he had seen for the DS.|$|E
