Based on cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments, the detection {{mechanism for the}} analytes at a copper electrode was {{proved to be the}} formation of complexes between di- and <b>tricarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> and Cu(II) ion on the electrode surface.

At the working potential of 0. 12 V (versus SCE), the calibration curves for the analytes were linear with about three orders of magnitude and the detection limits (S/N= 3) for them were between 4 and 8 fmol.

Malonic, succinic, glutaric and adipic acids, which are dicarboxylic acids with 1, 2, 3 and 4 straight hydrocarbons located between two carboxylic groups, decreased the OF in a concentration-dependent manner. Other long-chain dicarboxylic acids did not change the OF in rat RBCs. The benzoic acid derivatives, isophthalic and terephthalic acids, but not phthalic acid, decreased the OF in a concentration-dependent manner. Benzene- 1, 2, 3 -tricarboxylic acid, but not benzene- 1, 3, 5 -tricarboxylic acid, also decreased the OF in rat RBCs. On the other hand, monocarboxylic acids possessing 2 to 7 straight hydrocarbons and benzoic acid increased the OF in rat RBCs. In short-chain dicarboxylic acids, {{a limited number of}} hydrocarbons between the two carboxylic groups are thought to form a V- or U-shaped structure and interact with phospholipids in the RBC membrane. In benzene dicarboxylic and <b>tricarboxylic</b> <b>acids,</b> a part of benzene nucleus between the two carboxylic groups is thought to enter the plasma membrane and act on acyl-chain in phospholipids in the RBC membrane.

25|$|The {{final product}} of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase {{activity}} is succinyl-CoA {{which is a}} <b>tricarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> cycle substrate. A side effect of excess methylmalonyl-CoA is an interruption of the enzymes responsible for other transformations earlier in the metabolism of propionyl-CoA, leading to propanoic acidemia as well. This, along with an excess of methylmalonyl-CoA leads to the depletion of ATP through oxidative stress and coenzyme A. This disrupts the biosynthesis of myelin, urea, and glucose. Specifically, excess methylmalonyl-CoA places oxidative stress on the mitochondrial enzymes involved in the urea cycle (such as ammonia-dependent-carbamoyl-phosphate synthase or CPS1), and inhibits its mechanism of action. The combination of inhibited urea synthesis and poor protein metabolism, {{as well as a}} weakly replenished <b>tricarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> cycle contribute to the symptoms of methylmalonic acidemia.|$|E
25|$|Odd chain {{fatty acids}} are also metabolized through the methylmalonyl pathway. The {{degradation}} of odd chain fatty acids releases Acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA.

Some apparently ancient and critical metabolic processes require several compounds, some of which are relatively labile such as keto acids. Therefore, a prebiotic setting for any such individual process would have required either a continuous distant source for the entire suite of intact precursor molecules and/or an energetic and compact local synthesis, particularly of the more fragile members. To date, compounds such as pyruvic acid, oxaloacetic acid, citric acid, isocitric acid, and α-ketoglutaric acid (all members of the citric acid cycle) have not been identified in extraterrestrial sources or, as a group, as part of a “one pot” suite of compounds synthesized under plausibly prebiotic conditions. We have identified these compounds and others in carbonaceous meteorites and/or as low temperature (laboratory) reaction products of pyruvic acid. In meteorites, we observe many as part of three newly reported classes of compounds: keto acids (pyruvic acid and homologs), hydroxy <b>tricarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> (citric acid and homologs), and <b>tricarboxylic</b> <b>acids.</b> Laboratory syntheses using 13 C-labeled reactants demonstrate that one compound alone, pyruvic acid, can produce several (nonenzymatic) members of the citric acid cycle including oxaloacetic acid.

25|$|A {{large number}} of species within many genera of leguminous plants, e.g. Astragalus, Coronilla, Hippocrepis, Indigofera, Lotus, Securigera and Scorpiurus, produce {{chemicals}} that derive from the compound 3-nitropropanoic acid (3-NPA, beta-nitropropionic acid). The free acid 3-NPA is an irreversible inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration, and thus the compound inhibits the <b>tricarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> cycle. This inhibition caused by 3-NPA is especially toxic to nerve cells and represents a very general toxic mechanism suggesting a profound ecological importance due to the big number of species producing this compound and its derivatives. A second and closely related class of secondary metabolites that occur in many species of leguminous plants is defined by isoxazolin-5-one derivatives. These compounds occur in particular together with 3-NPA and related derivatives {{at the same time}} in the same species, as found in Astragalus canadensis and Astragalus collinus. 3-NPA and isoxazlin-5-one derivatives also occur in many species of leaf beetles (see defense in insects).|$|E

40|$|Many {{vascular}} plant species {{are unable to}} colonize calcareous sites. Thus, the floristic composition of adjacent limestone and acid silicate soils differs greatly. The inability of calcifuge plants to establish in limestone sites seems related to a low capacity of such plants to solubilize and absorb Fe or phosphate from these soils. Until now, mechanisms regulating this differing ability of plants to colonize limestone sites have not been elucidated. We propose that contrasting exudation of low-molecular organic acids is a major mechanism involved and show that germinating seeds and young seedlings of limestone plants exude considerably more di- and <b>tricarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> than calcifuges, which mainly exude monocarboxylic <b>acids.</b> The <b>tricarboxylic</b> citric <b>acid</b> is a powerful extractor of Fe, and the dicarboxylic oxalic acid a very effective extractor of phosphate from limestone soils.

The products formed upon oxidation by RuO 4 were analysed by GC/MS and revealed {{the presence of a}} wide range of carboxyl and/or carbonyl moiety containing compounds with carbon skeletons ranging from C 5 to C 20. The Estonian Kukersites reveal the presence of a characteristic set of mono-, di-, and <b>tricarboxylic</b> <b>acids.</b> These compounds suggest that the Estonian Kukersites are composed of a polymer consisting of mainly C 21 and C 23 n-alkenyl resorcinol building blocks. Similarly, although the <b>tricarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> are not present, the RuO 4 degradation product mixtures of the Guttenberg Member samples, suggest a poly(n-alkyl resorcinol) structure. The higher thermal maturity is most likely responsible for the different chemistry and morphology of the G. prisca microfossils in these samples. Because compounds like n-alkenyl resorcinols are known to polymerise under oxygenated conditions even in an aqueous environment, it is not per se necessary that these microfossils are composed of a selectively preserved biopolymeric cell wall.

At high pH values (above 5. 0), the low-affinity system was absent or not measurable. The two transport systems exhibited different substrate specificities. Isocitric acid was a competitive inhibitor of citric acid for the high-affinity system, suggesting that these <b>tricarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> used the same transport system, while aconitic, tricarballylic, trimesic, and hemimellitic acids were not competitive inhibitors.

In {{the case of the}} subtribe Chrysomelina (Chrysomelinae), all live stages are protected by the occurrence of isoxazolin-5-one derived glucosides that partially contain esters of 3-nitropropanoic acid (3-NPA, beta-nitropropionic acid). The latter compound is an irreversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase. Hence, 3-NPA inhibits the <b>tricarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> cycle. This inhibition leads to neurodegeneration with symptoms similar to those caused by Huntington's disease. [...] Since leaf beetles produce high concentrations of 3-NPA esters, a powerful chemical defense against a wide range of different predators is obvious. The larvae of Chrysomelina leaf beetles developed a second defensive strategy that is based on the excretion of droplets via pairs of defensive glands {{at the back of the}} insects. These droplets are immediately presented after mechanical disturbance and contain volatile compounds that derive from sequestered plant metabolites. Due to the specialization of leaf beetles to a certain host plant, the composition of the larval secretion is species-dependent. For instance, the red poplar leaf beetle (Chrysomela populi) consumes the leaves of poplar plants, which contain salicin. This compound is taken up by the insect and then further transformed biochemically into salicylaldehyde, an odor very similar to benzaldehyde. The presence of salicin and salicylaldehyde can repel potential predators of leaf beetles.|$|E
