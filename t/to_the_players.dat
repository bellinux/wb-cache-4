5|$|Snyder's response, {{and that}} of other fans, {{reflects}} the psychology of identification with sports teams. Self-esteem becomes bound <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> and the team, with many beneficial but also some unfortunate consequences, including denial or rationalization of misbehavior.|$|E
5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>players,</b> {{they refused}} to divulge more {{strategic}} material, such as team tactics and player selection policies. One of the most publicised {{of a series of}} betting controversies in cricket in the 1990s, the matter was initially covered up by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB), which decided that it was sufficient to privately fine the players. The ACB concluded that, since Waugh and Warne had previously accused Pakistani cricket captain Saleem Malik of attempting to bribe them to lose matches, their credibility as witnesses would be damaged if their own involvement with John was publicised. The ACB reported the matter to the International Cricket Council, and there the matter ended.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} other majors, winning the Masters gives a golfer several {{privileges}} which make his career more secure. Masters champions are automatically invited {{to play in the}} other three majors (the U.S. Open, The Open Championship, and the PGA Championship) {{for the next five years}} (except for amateur winners, unless they turn pro within the five-year period), and earn a lifetime invitation to the Masters. They also receive membership on the PGA Tour for the following five seasons and invitations <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Players</b> Championship for five years.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Herald Sun <b>Player</b> of <b>the</b> Year {{award is}} a media {{award for the}} Australian Football League (AFL) given by Melbourne {{newspaper}} the Herald Sun. It has been awarded annually since 1991 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> who garners <b>the</b> most votes throughout the season, with a selected Herald Sun journalist awarding five votes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> they judge <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> [...] "best on ground", four votes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second-best <b>player,</b> three votes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> third-best <b>player,</b> two votes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fourth-best <b>player</b> and one vote for <b>the</b> fifth best <b>player.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>players,</b> Brown hired {{a number}} of assistant coaches. John Brickels, an Ohio native, was brought in early on to sign players while Brown {{was still in the}} Navy. He later served as a backfield coach. Another hire was Blanton Collier, a high school coach for 16 years who had been an assistant to Brown at Great Lakes. Collier succeeded Brown in 1963 as the team's head coach. Fritz Heisler was brought in as a guard coach and stayed with the Browns until the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Inactive in 2004–05 due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> lockout and his ongoing suspension, {{which had}} been {{extended}} internationally, Bertuzzi returned to the Canucks in 2005–06, as the league ended his playing ban. He recorded 25 goals and 71 points, including two hat tricks (November 13, 2005, against the Detroit Red Wings and January 14, 2006, against the New York Islanders). Though he ranked third in team scoring, Crawford has recalled {{that by the end}} of the season, Näslund and Bertuzzi had been eclipsed by Daniel and Henrik Sedin as the team's offensive leaders.|$|E
5|$|Mainstream opinion {{reflects}} {{the function of}} identification with a sports team in both individual and group psychology. There are many benefits associated with sports fandom, both private (increased self-esteem) and public (community solidarity). The activity of viewing sporting events provide shared experiences that reinforce personal and group identification with a team. The name, mascot, cheerleaders, and marching band performances reinforce and become associated with these shared experiences. Daniel Snyder explicitly invokes these associations with family, friends, and an 81-year tradition as being the most important reasons for keeping the Redskins name. When self-esteem becomes bound <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> and the team, there are many beneficial but also some unfortunate consequences, including denial or rationalization of misbehavior. However, for some, the identity being expressed is one of supremacy, with the defense of native mascots clearly racist.|$|E
5000|$|The game's {{instructions}} do {{not reveal}} all valid verbs, {{as it is}} left <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>to</b> discover them. [...] The instructions also mention that the Arabian Nights folk tales may provide useful hints <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>player.</b>|$|R
50|$|The game {{is made of}} 35 halls (levels). Each time <b>the</b> <b>player</b> makes <b>the</b> bubble exit a hall, he wins 1000 points + left bonus. Action on {{animation}} may add 5000 points <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>player.</b> <b>The</b> bonus is re-initialized {{at every}} new hall.

5|$|Newman {{needed to}} find {{financial}} backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, from {{his experience as a}} singing teacher, agreed. As members of Wood's brass and woodwind sections were unwilling to buy new low-pitched instruments, Cathcart imported a set from Belgium and lent them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>players.</b> After a season, the players recognised that the low pitch would be permanently adopted, and they bought the instruments from him.|$|E
5|$|Reception towards Colin McRae Rally was mixed. The primary {{criticism}} among professional reviewers was {{the lack}} of content and omission of important features. However, the attempt to replicate the driving experience of classic Colin McRae Rally games was complimented. Critics generally believed that the level of difficulty and realistic driving model would appease rally fans and experienced players but might deter beginners. Upon release, the PC version was received negatively by players who were not expecting a mobile game port. The reaction prompted Codemasters to offer refunds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>players.</b>|$|E
5|$|Round two {{consisted}} of five questions posed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>players.</b> The host read a question, {{and one of}} the contestants buzzed-in and provided a response. Their response, along with two other choices, were provided to the other two contestants, who selected one of the choices. Correct answers earned three spins for a buzz-in answer and one spin for a multiple choice answer. After five questions, all three contestants advanced to the final round.|$|E

50|$|The World Cup {{stage is}} similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hogwarts stage {{in terms of}} game play, with the {{exception}} {{that there are no}} challenges available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> and <b>the</b> teams are named after real countries instead of Hogwarts houses. Several different team choices are available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>player,</b> including Japan, Australia, the United States, England and Bulgaria, the latter of which features the 'star seeker' from the book series, Viktor Krum. However, Bulgaria is unavailable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> until they collect enough Quidditch cards.|$|R
5000|$|In theory {{the limit}} {{for a game}} with one deck of 36 cards is six players, but this gives a {{considerable}} advantage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> who attacks first, and a considerable disadvantage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> who defends first.

5|$|The Rawlings Gold Glove Award, usually {{referred}} to as the Gold Glove, is the award given annually <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> judged to have exhibited superior individual fielding performances at each fielding position in both the National and American Leagues, as voted by the managers and coaches in each league. Managers are not permitted to vote for their own players. Eighteen Gold Gloves are awarded each year (with the exception of 1957, 1985 and 2007), one at each of the nine positions in each league.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Open is {{currently}} {{the second of the}} four major championships to be played each year. U.S. Open champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors (the Masters, the Open Championship (British Open), and the PGA Championship) for the next five years, and earn a ten-year exemption from qualifying for the U.S. Open. They also receive membership on the PGA Tour for the following five seasons and invitations <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Players</b> Championship for the five years following their victories. The champion receives a gold champion's medal, and the U.S. Open Championship Cup, which the winner is allowed to keep for a year.|$|E
5|$|The {{franchise}} {{includes several}} spin-off games, including the Dragon Quest Monsters RPG. The series has also inspired arcade games {{such as the}} Japanese , where players compete for real-life cards with monster data that the arcade game issues <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> through a slot on its front. The latter is the only spin-off series to have none of its titles released outside Japan. The Mystery Dungeon and Fortune Street series use characters and other elements from Dragon Quest games, and the Mystery Dungeon series {{has gone on to}} spawn its own franchise.|$|E
50|$|If {{there is}} more than one <b>player</b> with <b>the</b> same amount of goals, since 2008 <b>the</b> tie-breaker goes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> who has contributed the most assists.

50|$|Short pay {{refers to}} a partial payout made by a slot machine, which is less than <b>the</b> amount due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>player.</b> This occurs if the coin hopper has been {{depleted}} {{as a result of}} making earlier payouts <b>to</b> <b>players.</b> <b>The</b> remaining amount due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> is either paid as a hand pay or an attendant will come and refill the machine.|$|R
5000|$|The stock {{version of}} the game {{includes}} the following playable U-boats. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> enters <b>the</b> war with only a limited choice of U-boats {{if they choose to}} start in 1939. However, the types of U-boat available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> can vary greatly depending on the year during which <b>the</b> <b>player</b> wants <b>to</b> start their career in.

5|$|The reigning {{champion}} of the competition is automatically invited {{to play in the}} other three majors for the next five years, and is exempt from qualifying for the PGA Championship for life. The champion also receives membership on the PGA Tour for the following five years and invitations <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Players</b> Championship for five years. The prize of the tournament is the Wanamaker Trophy, which the champion keeps until the following year's competition. The PGA Championship was originally a match play event; however, in 1958 it was changed to a stroke play event.|$|E
5|$|Tomb of Horrors {{is set in}} the World of Greyhawk, a D {{campaign}} setting. In Tomb of Horrors, the adventurers {{encounter a}} number of tricks and traps while attempting to penetrate the tomb of a dead wizard. As the scenario begins, the players are told that the evil wizard Acererak is said to linger in his ancient tomb in undead form. Originally a powerful lich, he has (unbeknownst <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>players)</b> become a demi-lich, a more powerful form of undead that has transcended the need for any physical body apart from its skull. Player characters must survive the deadly traps in the tomb and fight their way into the demi-lich's elaborately concealed inner sanctum to destroy him once and for all.|$|E
5|$|Trautmann {{attended}} the evening's post-match banquet (where Alma Cogan sang <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>players)</b> despite {{being unable to}} move his head, {{and went to bed}} expecting his injury to heal with rest. As the pain did not recede, the following day he went to St George's Hospital, where he was told he merely had a crick in his neck which would go away. Three days later, he got a second opinion from a doctor at Manchester Royal Infirmary. An X-ray revealed he had dislocated five vertebrae in his neck, the second of which was cracked in two. The third vertebra had wedged against the second, preventing further damage which could have cost Trautmann his life.|$|E

A final four games were released for sale in 1973, designed wholly or in part by Don Emry. The games do not enforce game rules or keep track of score; that is left up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>players.</b>|$|E
5|$|After his {{baseball}} career ended, Paciorek {{returned to school}} and {{earned a degree in}} physical education from the University of Houston, a degree that he began to pursue while recovering from back surgery. While acquiring his degree, he became a Christian Scientist and married Linda Cupp. After graduating from college, he spent several years as an instructor at a Jewish community center, then became a physical education teacher after inquiring about a Christian Science Monitor advertisement for a teaching position at Clairbourn School in San Gabriel, California. Linda died of breast cancer in 1987, and Paciorek married Karen Purdy two years later. Paciorek has four sons and four daughters. His nephew, Joey Paciorek, played in the Milwaukee Brewers minor league organization, and his sons, Pete and Mack, had minor league careers as well. While watching his son in training camp, Paciorek became an author after watching what he felt was improper instruction given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>players.</b> He has since written two books, Plato & Socrates, Baseball's Wisest Fans and The Principle of Baseball, and All There is to Know About Hitting.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the competition, it was {{reported}} that Domenech was considering changing up the style of play in the team's 4–3–3 formation with Malouda possibly moving from the winger role into the midfield. Following Malouda's relegation to the bench for insubordination, Diaby was inserted in his place and made his World Cup debut in the team's opening group stage match against Uruguay. The match ended 0–0 with Diaby playing the entire match. He was credited by Scottish newspaper The Scotsman as being the team's best performer in the goalless draw. Diaby featured as a starter in both of France's remaining group stage matches against Mexico and South Africa. France lost both matches as the competition ultimately ended in disastrous competitively and personally due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> going on strike in response to its disagreement over the expulsion of striker Nicolas Anelka from the team. As a result of the players' mutiny, Diaby, along with the 22 other members of the team, were suspended for the team's friendly match against Norway.|$|E
