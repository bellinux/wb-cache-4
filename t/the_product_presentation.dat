Research question: ”How {{and why do}} supermarkets distinguish and implement the presentation and visual merchandising of organic food from non-organic food?” Purpose: The purpose {{of this research is}} to provide new theoretical contribution of how the major food chains are working with visual merchandising and specifically how they differentiate organic products from non-organic products. This is to increase understanding of the specific topic for future research as well as for established and new companies that enter the organic food market. Methodology: This study is based on a combining research approach, which includes both a deductive and an inductive approach to answer the developed research question. Frame of references: Previously research regarding theories of consumer behaviour, Visual merchandising, Sensory marketing and visual elements and visual merchandising techniques are presented. Empirical findings: Primary data was collected and presented from three Swedish supermarkets. Analysis: The analysis compares the collected empirical data with the theoretical framework. Conclusion: The findings shows that the supermarkets studied in some areas distinguish between organic and non-organic products when planning <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>presentation.</b> However, the empirical result does confirm that those supermarkets do invest in organic products and that they are trying to increase the sales.

40|$|Sensory {{attributes}} and extrinsic {{factors associated with}} <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>presentation</b> are important drivers of product liking and consumer choice. It is therefore useful to investigate consumers’ acceptability {{in the light of}} all these aspects for better supporting product development and marketing. It is relatively simple to conceive experiments to investigate these aspects in the case of processed products. In this work we extended this approach to the case of fresh unprocessed products such as fruit and vegetables presenting two case studies on apple acceptability. In a first study, we investigated whether the intensity of intrinsic sensory {{attributes and}} different information on fibre and antioxidant content, provided immediately before tasting, could affect the acceptability of four varieties of apple, characterised by four combinations of two levels (high and low) of crunchiness and sweetness. Higher crunchiness and sweetness increased the liking whereas the effect of nutritional information was not significant, at least for the mean of the population. Interesting results emerged when segmenting consumers and characterising them according to their age and their awareness of healthy aspects. In a second study, the combined effect of flavour and different external information (apples claimed to be ‘traditional’ or ‘chosen for their intense aroma’) on acceptability was studied. For this purpose, the flavour of apples was artificially modified maintaining constant the other sensory attributes as checked by a sensory trained panel. Two apple treatment variants were developed: anise and flower flavoured. The concentration of 2 flavouring agents in treated apples and the related flavour profiles were statistically significant different from the reference untreated apple as demonstrated by instrumental head space analysis (SPME–GC–MS and PTR-MS) and by sensory analyses (discriminant and descriptive) respectively. Anise flavour significantly reduced the global liking of apple of the whole consumer panel, whereas external information seemed relevant only for specific groups of consumers, who are not interested in natural food. Our findings suggest that also for fresh unprocessed products it is possible to investigate the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors by conjoint analysis. This work is a contribution to apple producers/distributors who gained {{a better understanding of the}} importance consumers give to sensory attributes and health information in order to support consumer-led breeding selections...|$|E

The survey focuses in specific characteristics aiming {{to evaluate the}} quality of e-commerce systems {{as far as the}} end user is concerned. This paper provides the set of characteristics used for the evaluation, discusses the evaluation method and the derived results and the presents the basic similarities and differences between Greek and International e-commerce systems. The paper presents detailed results from the evaluation of both Greek and International e-commerce systems related to characteristics such as the existence and usability of basic e-commerce functions –such as shopping cart, shopping list, search engine, etc. It also focuses on web-based characteristics – such as background colors, site map, multilingualism, etc. – and mostly focuses on e-commerce specific issues –such as <b>the</b> <b>product’s</b> <b>presentation,</b> payment methods, <b>product</b> shipment, etc. Evaluation results showed that the Greek e-commerce systems are developed having as model similar International e-commerce systems with fairly good results. It should be mentioned that the improvement of the quality for e-commerce systems would not have to be relied on coping the international systems. On the contrary the growth of Greek e-commerce systems should emphasize in the collaboration with the end user, in the application of new ideas. That will give impulse in the development and growth of Internet technologies and electronic commerce in Greece. 1...|$|R

Dogs were combed to remove fleas 24 hours post-infestation, the fleas were counted, collected, and then reapplied to each dog following completion of their respective count. At 48 hours post-infestation, comb counts were performed and fleas were removed. No fleas were collected from any dog in the fipronil/(S) -methoprene group at any 24 or 48 hours post-infestation assessment throughout the six weeks study, yielding a preventive efficacy of 100 %. For the spinosad treatment, efficacy was 100 % at 24 hours and 48 hours through Day 16, and thereafter declined. The results observed in the spinosad-treated dogs were highly variable between animals. At the 24 and 48 hours counts following the Day 21 infestation, only five of eight spinosad-treated dogs (62. 5 %) were flea-free. Following the Day 28 infestation, spinosad efficacy fell to 85 % and 89 %, for the 24 hours and 48 hours counts, and only two dogs (25 %) were flea free, compared to 100 % flea-free dogs in the fipronil/(S) -methoprene group. No fleas were collected from the fipronil/(S) - methoprene treated dogs throughout the entire study, therefore, no eggs were collected at any time from any dog in the group. However, in the spinosad group adult fleas were found on dogs starting on Day 21 and by Day 30, 42 eggs were collected from one dog that had 107 adult fleas counted at 48 hours.
