To test the lasting impact of combat on religious behavior, a follow-up survey was conducted 50 years later with a different sample of veterans from all branches of service. First study of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>included</b> analysis of archived World War II surveys after a battle and showed a soldier’s reliance on prayer rose from 32% to 74% as the battle intensified. The second study showed that 50 years later, many soldiers still exhibited religious behavior, but it varied by their war experience. Soldiers who faced heavy combat (vs. no combat) attended church 21% more often if they claimed their war experience was negative, but those who claimed their experience was positive attended 26% less often. The more a combat veteran disliked the war, the more religious they were 50 years later.|$|E

50|$|Amanda Agnew and Hedy Justus, {{from the}} Ohio State University, studied {{examples}} of trauma and {{stress in the}} population of Medieval Giecz in Poland. During this time, Giecz was an important political and religious center. <b>The</b> <b>sample</b> <b>included</b> 275 burials that were analyzed for trauma and stress, but only adults were analyzed for trauma. Most cases of trauma were non-violent, although 3.4% of individuals with trauma had injuries that were clearly due to violent intent. The low evidence of intentional violence led the authors to conclude the unlikelihood {{of members of the}} population being involved in military activity, which was common in the area. However, the stress-related traumatic injuries indicated a population that had a very laborious lifestyle, often associated with agricultural activities. For example, the population exhibited a high frequency of spinal trauma, including compression fractures and spondylolysis. Vertebral trauma is indicative of heavy compression loads over long periods of time. The authors also studied osteochondritis dissecans, which can be caused by repetitive traumatic events and the overuse of joints due to physical activity. The study concluded that heavy workload and strenuous activities extended to males, females, and adolescents. Furthermore, the authors found that the population at Giecz experienced stressful environmental conditions like poor nutrition and infections.|$|E
50|$|Substance {{abuse is}} a {{patterned}} use of drug consumption {{in which a}} person uses substances in amounts or with methods that are harmful to themselves or to others. Substance abuse is commonly associated with a range of maladaptive behaviors that are both detrimental to the individual and to society. Given the terrible consequences that can transpire from abusing substances, recreational experimentation and/or recurrent use of drugs are traditionally thought to be most prevalent among marginalized strands of society. Nevertheless, the very opposite is true; research both in national and individual levels have found that the relationship between IQ and substance abuse indicates positive correlations between superior intelligence, higher alcohol consumption and drug consumption.In 2013, researchers from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville performed the most compressive analysis of worldwide national alcohol consumption per capita and country level IQ scores to find a significant positive association between the two. <b>The</b> <b>sample</b> <b>included</b> 99 countries from all continents representing a wide range of cultures, religious traditions, political regimes, and socio-economic development. National IQ scores for the countries in the sample were extracted from a series of benchmark studies of national IQ averages by Lynn and Meisenberg and followed a normal distribution pattern. Data for per capita alcohol intake constituted of aggregate beer and wine consumption records from the World Health Organization from 1970-2005. Regression results suggest that even after controlling for income, health, religion, and urbanization, one standard deviation increase in national IQ is associated with a more than one liter increase in the per capita alcohol consumption in countries worldwide.|$|E
50|$|The prodissoconch, {{the shell}} of the free-swimming veliger larval stage of C. virginica, is {{composed}} of aragonite, {{as opposed to the}} calcite composition of a postlarval adult oyster shell. The epithelium of the oyster's mantle secretes both the prodissoconch and the postlarval shells, but at different times. Tests were conducted to try to determine why larval and adult shells have different compositions. At the Biological Laboratory of the U.S. Bureau of Commercial Fisheries in Milford, Connecticut, larvae from the eastern oyster were reared in breeding tanks and were then collected, washed with distilled water, and dried as they died. <b>The</b> <b>sample</b> <b>included</b> a variety of larval stages, starting with the straight-hinge veliger larva with its shell, the protostracum, to the last stage of the umbo larva with its shell, the prodissoconch. Both of these larval stages have very thin, hyaline, and translucent shells. The study showed the specific gravity of aragonite is 2.95 and calcite is 2.72, so as far as weight is concerned, no advantage results for a larval oyster to have a shell made of one composition over the other. Then, oyster larval shells were compared not with adult shells, but instead with other bivalve larval shells. All, or almost all, bivalves have aragonitic larval shells because the majority of them have aragonitic adult shells, and C. virginica oyster larvae are assumed to have an aragonitic shell simply to conform to the general pattern in the bivalves. No adaptive need is seen for free-swimming larvae to have shells of a composition other than aragonite; they have that composition because their ancestors did. Adaptations for a thicker shell are required for defense against predators because the oysters are permanently immobilized and therefore live in different environments than those of the free-swimming larvae.|$|E
