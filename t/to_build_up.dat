5|$|In {{classical}} Pentecostalism, the baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit {{is understood to}} be a separate and distinct experience occurring sometime after regeneration. It is an empowering experience, equipping Spirit-filled believers for witness and ministry. Extending from this {{is the belief that}} all the spiritual gifts mentioned in the New Testament are to be sought and exercised <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> the church. Pentecostals believe that Spirit baptism will be accompanied by the physical evidence of speaking in tongues (glossolalia).|$|E

5|$|On 1 February 2011, Ian Thorpe {{announced}} that he would try to qualify for the 2012 Olympics in London. Thorpe's major focus was the 100m and 200m freestyle at 2012's trials, stating he could offer the most value to the Australian team in the relays. He would not swim the 400m, claiming he would not have enough time <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> endurance for that event. This led many to see a renewed rivalry with Michael Phelps.|$|E

5|$|Rorquals use throat pleats {{to expand}} their mouths, which allow them to feed more effectively. However, {{rorquals}} need <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> water pressure in order {{to expand their}} mouths, leading to a lunge-feeding behavior. Lunge-feeding is where a whale rams a bait ball (a swarm of small fish) at high speed. Rorquals generally have streamlined physiques to reduce drag in the water while doing this.|$|E
5|$|The Weather Bureau {{had issued}} {{the first of}} its twice-daily reports at {{approximately}} 8:00a.m.; it did not send another report to Washington, D.C. until 8:00p.m. This proved to be a serious problem: the storm would have {{the better part of a}} day <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> hurricane forces before the Bureau headquarters in Washington, D.C., would have detailed information.|$|E
5|$|The {{inevitable}} {{consequence of}} demands for ever greater speed, striking power, and endurance meant that displacement, and hence cost, of dreadnoughts tended to increase. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 imposed {{a limit of}} 35,000 tons on the displacement of capital ships. In subsequent years treaty battleships were commissioned <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> to this limit.

With Goudsmit he investigated the Zeeman effect of hyperfine structure of atomic levels, which became the subject of his 1930 PhD thesis.|$|E

As the garbage men drive away without collecting his trash, Homer angrily shouts insults at them, causing a fight that leads to the family's garbage service being cut off. Garbage gradually piles up on their front lawn and despite Marge's pleas, Homer refuses to apologize to the garbage men.|$|E

5|$|Around 1450 BC, Greece {{was divided}} {{into a series of}} warrior kingdoms, the most {{important}} being centered in Mycenae, Tiryns, Pylos and Thebes. Before the end of the same century, this militaristic civilization replaced the former priestess-dominated civilization of Minoan Cretans in the Aegean. Thus, the Mycenaeans began <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> their maritime power in the Aegean Sea, expanding towards the Aegean Islands and Anatolian coast. The warlike nature of the Mycenaeans was probably a decisive factor in their diplomatic relations towards the other Late Bronze Age powers. Mycenaean warriors were also hired as mercenaries in foreign armies, such as in Egypt.|$|E

His role was now to encourage West Germany <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> its forces, while reassuring the Germans that doing so would not result in a United States withdrawal.
