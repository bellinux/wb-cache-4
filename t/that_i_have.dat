5|$|I King Æthelstan, declare <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{learned that}} the public peace has not been kept to the extent, either of my wishes, or of the {{provisions}} laid down at Grately, and my councillors say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> suffered this too long.|$|E
5|$|Fear of suffocation—something <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> or fear {{is never}} {{being able to}} enjoy myself,... 'Cause I love my work so much, I find it really hard {{to go out and}} have a good time.... I don't go to nightclubs,... You don't see {{pictures}} of me falling out of a club drunk. I don't go—and that's because I usually go and then, you know, a whiskey and a half into it, I {{got to get back to}} work.|$|E
5|$|I {{have killed}} peasants men and women, old and young, {{who lived at}} Oblucitza and Novoselo, where the Danube flows into the sea, up to Rahova, which is located near Chilia, from the lower Danube up to such places as Samovit and Ghighen. We killed 23,884 Turks without {{counting}} those whom we burned in homes or the Turks whose heads were cut by our soldiers...Thus, your highness, you must know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> broken the peace with him (Sultan Mehmet II).|$|E
60|$|I answered, truly enough, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{not thought}} what to do, and he persisted <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> promised to stay.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{answered}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{thought it}} was later. Not <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> really thought so, but because my conversational powers were effectually scattered.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{explained}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> felt {{restless and}} disinclined to sleep, regretted <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> caused her anxiety, and thanked {{her for her}} thoughtful kindness.|$|R
5|$|It is a {{collaboration}} {{with one of}} my friends from the international music industry, Eric Turner, a very talented guy from Sweden, and with the boys from Play & Win. It is very particular. I consider that I went through all stages, from popcorn to dance, club and pop music, so I considered <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> reached a maturity which allows me to release a song which I like, which makes me move in a club and makes me want to hear it on the radio, and I'm very fulfilled.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{this edition}} I have not read, but, from the little <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen, I think it not {{dangerous}} to declare that, in my opinion, its pomp recommends it more than its accuracy. There is no distinction made between the ancient reading, and the innovations of the editor; {{there is no reason}} given for any of the alterations which are made; the emendations of former editions are adopted without any acknowledgement, and few of the difficulties are removed which have hitherto embarrassed the readers of Shakespeare.|$|E
25|$|We {{are losing}} {{one of its}} finest Members, a Member <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> great respect for, because he always did his homework, was so {{articulate}} and eloquent on this floor.|$|E
6000|$|... "What did I say? <b>I</b> said <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{many things}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> valued greatly, but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> one thing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> valued more than gold or houses--more even than my right." ...|$|R
60|$|A little surprised, <b>I</b> {{answered}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen a good deal, but I did not add <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{not found}} what I was looking for.|$|R
6000|$|... "I ask {{yourself}} {{whether it is}} not true? She would have received me with open arms, and would you then have dared, as her guardian, to bid her refuse the offer made to her, when you had learned, as you would have done, that she loved me; <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> loved her {{with all my heart}} before <b>I</b> left England; <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> left it with the view of enabling myself to marry her; <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been wonderfully successful; <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> come back with no other hope in the world than that of giving it all to her; <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been able to show you my whole life, so that no girl need be afraid to become my wife--" ...|$|R
25|$|The most {{extraordinary}} woman (in art) <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> encountered in my life. It {{was as if}} she had diamonds in her bones and in her interior light struggled to come out through the pores of her skin.|$|E
25|$|June 12.— After we had dined with Mr. Pageatt, {{where we}} had a neat dinner and strawberries, longest <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen, {{we went to a}} house called Dole-hoof, where we saw the {{pictures}} made in wax most liveyly...|$|E
25|$|Stallard had {{the most}} {{abrasive}} nature <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever met. He could never believe {{that he could have}} a bad idea or make a bad decision. And sometimes he'd go berserk with those who disagreed with him. He didn't have, let us say, the delicacies of negotiation.|$|E
60|$|I {{told her}} {{she seemed to be}} so {{perfectly}} sensible of my condition, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> nothing to ask of her but this, <b>that</b> as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> told her <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> money sufficient, but not a great quantity, she would order it so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might be at as little superfluous charge as possible.|$|R
60|$|It took Miss Tita rather {{longer than}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{expected}} to guess <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was there; but {{when at last}} she came out {{she looked at me}} without surprise. I said to her <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been waiting for her, and she asked why <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not let her know. I was glad the next day <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> checked myself before remarking <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> wished to see if a friendly intuition would not tell her: it became a satisfaction to me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not indulged in that rather tender joke. What I did say was virtually the truth--that I was too nervous, since I expected her now to settle my fate.|$|R
6000|$|... "I felt an inward {{satisfaction}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not, in {{the first}} moment of meeting, betrayed any warmth, any enthusiasm; <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> saluted this man with a quiet and steady phlegm.|$|R
25|$|The cricket {{out there}} in the ten years that have elapsed between the first visit of an English eleven and my leaving the country had made phenomenal improvement... It is a source of the {{greatest}} satisfaction to me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> in some measure contributed to the successful state of things.|$|E
25|$|Now, twenty-two {{days have}} passed since Jesus allowed the devils to vent their anger on me. My Father, my whole body is bruised from the beatings <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{received}} to the present time by our enemies. Several times, they have even torn off my shirt {{so that they could}} strike my exposed flesh.|$|E
25|$|Your honor, I feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{been convicted}} of violating an unjust statute. I will {{continue}} in the future, as I have in the past, to oppose this law in any way I can. Any other action would be in violation of my ideal of academic freedom—that is, to teach the truth as guaranteed in our constitution, of personal and religious freedom. I think the fine is unjust.|$|E
60|$|Of the use <b>that</b> <b>I</b> made of <b>that</b> time <b>I</b> find it {{difficult}} to speak. From the first moment <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> beheld Roxalanne <b>I</b> <b>had</b> realized the truth of Chatellerault's assertion <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never known a woman. He was right. Those <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> met and by whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> judged the sex had, by contrast with this child, little claim to the title. Virtue <b>I</b> <b>had</b> accounted a shadow without substance; innocence, a synonym for ignorance; love, a fable, a fairy tale for the delectation of overgrown children.|$|R
60|$|The man's deportment was magnificent. But for {{the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> long ago lost all faith in him <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> felt, without {{the shadow of a}} doubt, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made a supreme fool of myself. But as it was, my faith was only shaken. The hideous {{possibility}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made a mistake was there like a shadow, but I could not accept it as a certainty.|$|R
60|$|I {{answered}} his Highness <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> attended the divan {{merely as a}} matter of ceremony, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not interchanged a word with the Grand Pasha {{on the subject of the}} expedition.|$|R
25|$|In one {{department}} {{however the}} 1974–75 combination excelled any other <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen. They {{were the best}} fielding combination I have ever witnessed on the cricket field... everyone chased like demons, caught like angels, and, unfortunately, occasionally swore like troopers. Looking back at the Perth Test , I still {{find it difficult to}} believe that some of the catches that were taken were even in the bounds of possibility.|$|E
25|$|This conduct {{upon his}} part seems {{perfectly}} unaccountable...You know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always counselled you to bear everything and remain to the last. I thought {{it for the}} best. I am afraid {{it is no longer}} possible. Open breaches of this kind are always to be lamented, but you have the consolation that you have done your utmost to stave this extremity off as long as possible.|$|E
25|$|None of this, apparently, was enough. Sage {{wrote in}} a journal in August 1961, “I have said all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to say. There is nothing left {{for me to do}} but scream.” On January 8, 1963, she put a fatal bullet through her heart. Following {{instructions}} in her will, Pierre Matisse buried urns containing Sage’s and Tanguy’s ashes in the water off the coast of Tanguy’s native Brittany in 1964.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed that}} Hooja {{had made it}} appear <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{intentionally}} left Dian behind, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did not purpose ever returning to Pellucidar. He told them <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was of another world and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> tired of this and of its inhabitants.|$|R
60|$|I {{tried to}} say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never meant {{to return to the}} world, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> still kept to my mourning; but my mother said with {{authority}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better be grateful for any token of favour that was vouchsafed to me. She took me into her apartment after supper, and talked to me very seriously; telling me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must be very careful, for <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been so imprudent, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should certainly <b>have</b> been deprived of the custody of my son, if not imprisoned, unless my good godmother, Queen Henrietta, and herself had made themselves responsible for me.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> told Polly <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was very}} sorry <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> frightened her so much, but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{really did not}} know what had come over me; <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> sat there thinking, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{supposed}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> got regularly numbed, and had not noticed her knocking until I got up and opened the door. When I was thoroughly warmed again, I proposed going into the library to write my letters, but Polly would not let me, as she said <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> had more than enough excitement for one day. So I yielded to her entreaties, not sorry indeed to put off the painful task, if only for one day.|$|R
25|$|It is true <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> held, {{and still}} hold, a strong opinion {{with regard to}} the {{judgment}} of Marshall CJ in McCulloch v Maryland - the judgment on which Deakin v Webb was based - although I utter the opinion with a feeling that it will be regarded by some as almost blasphemy. I regard it as being the utterance rather of the statesman than of the lawyer.|$|E
25|$|It {{was one of}} {{the poorest}} Test matches in {{technique}} and spirit <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> witnessed. It lacked virility from birth. The Australians came to it with no great spirit of adventure or relish after the Ashes had been won. The policy was, after winning the toss, to hold tight and let the pitch and the Englishmen go to pieces. What went to pieces, of course, was the game itself.|$|E
25|$|I {{confess to}} God Almighty, before the whole company of heaven, and to you, my {{brothers}} and sisters, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> sinned in thought, word, and deed; in what I have done and in what I have failed to do, by my fault, by my fault, by my most grievous fault; wherefore I pray God Almighty to have mercy on me, forgive me all my sins, and bring me to everlasting life. Amen.|$|E
60|$|To Dian he <b>had</b> {{explained}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a mate in {{the world}} to which <b>I</b> was returning; <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never intended taking Dian the Beautiful back with me; and that she had seen the last of me.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> replied <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{read the}} ever-lovely story of Sleeping Beauty, indeed knew it by heart, and assured him {{modestly}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{not the least}} doubt of a happy ending--"that is, if the author be the least authority." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{moment later}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> struck the bonds from Dejah Thoris, and as her dear arms went about {{my neck and}} her perfect lips pressed to mine I forgot the horrors <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{witnessed}} and the suffering <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> endured in the rapture of my reward.|$|R
