5|$|In 2000 Lee {{released}} the 22-minute short Subrosa, following a woman's {{search for her}} mother in Seoul. Intended as a prequel for an undeveloped film entitled Priceless, the film was shot in several formats with a fifteen-person crew, hurriedly recording scenes in public locations. It extensively used character-centred shots, leading to what Lee described as an organic understanding of the character. It also featured on-screen sexual intercourse, framed in a medium shot, which Lee intended as a sign and not simply a sex scene. Although Priceless, meant as a sequel to Subrosa, went <b>through</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> thirty drafts, it was ultimately cancelled despite interest from Alliance Atlantis and Citytv.|$|E
5|$|The Mary Rose {{was one of}} {{the largest}} ships in the English navy <b>through</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> three decades of {{intermittent}} war and {{was one of the}} earliest examples of a purpose-built sailing warship. She was armed with new types of heavy guns that could fire through the recently invented gun-ports. After being substantially rebuilt in 1536, she was also one of the earliest ships that could fire a broadside, although the line of battle tactics that employed it had not yet been developed. Several theories have sought to explain the demise of the Mary Rose, based on historical records, knowledge of 16th-century shipbuilding, and modern experiments. The precise cause of her sinking is still unclear, because of conflicting testimonies and a lack of conclusive physical evidence.|$|E
