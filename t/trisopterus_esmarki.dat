40|$|A {{total of}} 313 <b>Trisopterus</b> <b>esmarki,</b> {{was caught in}} 11 beach seine-hauls in the {{littoral}} zone along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast in October 1992. The fish measured 5 - 10 cm (total length) and therefore belonged to the 1992 year-class. Similar surveys have been made annually since 1919, {{and this is the}} first time Norway pout has been caught...|$|E
40|$|In-situ target {{strengths}} of six fishes were determined with a split-beam echo sounder during cruises about Lofoten in March 1984 and the Shetland Islands in July 1984. The species and lengths, {{mean and standard}} deviation, are the following: cod (Gadus morhua), 82 +- 11 cm, saithe (Pollachius virens), 57 +- 6 cm; Norway pout (<b>Trisopterus</b> <b>esmarki),</b> 18 +- 2 and 15 +- 1 cm; herring (Clupea harengus), 28 +- 2 cm; redfish or ocean perch (Sebastes marinus), 20 +- 9 cm; and greater silver smelt (Argentina silus), 37 +- 4 cm. Extraction of unbiased mean target strenqths by a method of threshold compensation is described...|$|E
40|$|Hydrography and larval fish {{distribution}} in the northeastern North Sea were studied during a research programme carried out {{during the period from}} 1991 to 1994. The aim was to examine the connection between frontal zone formation and nursery characteristics of gadoid larvae at the shelf break. Emphasis was placed on the year-to-year variation in frontal characteristics and distributional patterns of larvae An area of about 67000 km 2 covering the northeastern North Sea, the Skagerrak and the Kattegat was surveyed by grid or transect sampling. At each sampling station the hydrography was studied by CTD casts, and the abundance of fish larvae was measured by depth integrating tows of a 2 m ring net. Five species of gadoid larvae and small luveniles were found in the area. cod Gadus rnorhua, whiting Merlangjus merlangus, haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, Norway pout <b>Trisopterus</b> <b>esmarki</b> and saithe Pollachius virens. Larval abundance differed markedly between species and years. The abundance of all species was the highest in 1992 and declined during the follo~ving 2 years. In 1994, cod and whiting were the only gadoid species observed. Peak abundance of all gadoids was found {{in the vicinity of the}} frontal zone; however, the relationship between larval distribution and hydrography differed among species. Correspondence between spatial and interannual variation in characteristics of frontal zones and larval distributions suggests that frontal zone variability is a central element in the early hfe of gadoid larvae from the area...|$|E
