It is shown that pulse current trimming techniques {{can be used to}} trim the poly-SiGe resistors by up to 50 % from their orig-inal values with accuracy better than 0. 5 %. The temperature co-efficient of resistance (TCR) is shown to be linearly proportional to the percent change in electrically <b>trimmed</b> poly-SiGe <b>resistance.</b> Fi-nally, we demonstrate resistance cycling using an electrical trim/re-covery sequence, indicating that the technique is reversible and is governed by dopant segregation/diffusion mechanisms.

40|$|As a ship {{approaches}} shallow water, {{a number}} of changes arise owing to the hydrodynamic interaction between {{the bottom of the}} ship’s hull and the seafloor. The flow velocity between the bottom of the hull and the seafloor increases, which leads to an increase in sinkage, <b>trim</b> and <b>resistance.</b> As the ship travels forward, squat of the ship may occur, stemming from this increase in sinkage and trim. Knowledge of a ship’s squat is necessary when navigating vessels through shallow water regions, such as rivers, channels and harbours.

Similarly, predicting a ship’s resistance in shallow water is equally important, to be able to calculate its power requirements.

Therefore, we have investigated the trimming by changing the film thckiness by anodic oxidation for cermet thin film resistors. The Ti-Si 0 _ 2 cermet thin films were anodized for 30 minutes at several different anodizing voltages using filter papers, which were wetted with Dimethyl Sulfoxide-Phosphoric Acid （ 20 ％）solution, and sandwiched between the film and top cathode electrode. 　The films showed a wide resistance change by anodization, but the anodized film resistors were not so stable as expected. By an anodization with the voltage lower than 15 volts, the trimming of less than 5 ％ is possible and reproducible. 　The heat-treatment in air after anodization developed markedly the stability of resistance. The cermet thin films, heat-treated at 300 ℃ for 3 hrs. in air after anodization at 50 volts, showed fairly good stability and a resistance change of less than 1 ％ by a 1000 -hour stability test at 125 ℃ in air.

Despite {{the high degree}} of amino acid identity between Trim 5 aQ and Trim 5 aTFP alleles, the Q/TFP polymorphism results in the differential restriction of some primate lentiviruses, suggesting these alleles differ in how they engage these capsids. Simian immunodeficiency virus of rhesus macaques (SIVmac) evolved to resist all three alleles. Thus, SIVmac provides a unique opportunity to study a virus {{in the context of the}} Trim 5 repertoire that drove its evolution in vivo. We exploited the evolved rhesus <b>Trim</b> 5 a <b>resistance</b> of this capsid to identify gain-of-sensitivity mutations that distinguish targets between the Trim 5 aQ and Trim 5 aTFP alleles. While both alleles recognize the capsid surface, Trim 5 aQ and Trim 5 aTFP alleles differed in their ability to restrict a panel of capsid chimeras and single amino acid substitutions. When mapped onto the structure of the SIVmac 239 capsid N-terminal domain, single amino acid substitutions affecting both alleles mapped to the b-hairpin. Given that none of the substitutions affected Trim 5 aQ alone, and the fact that the b-hairpin is conserved among retroviral capsids, we propose that the b-hairpin is a molecular pattern widely exploited by Trim 5 a proteins. Mutations specifically affecting rhesus Trim 5 aTFP (without affecting Trim 5 aQ) surround a site of conservation unique to primate lentiviruses, overlapping the CPSF 6 binding site.

40|$|There {{has been}} a lot of {{interest}} in trim optimisation to reduce fuel consumption and emissions of ships. Many existing ships are designed for a single operational condition with the aim of producing low resistance at their design speed and draft with an even keel. Given that a ship will often sail outside this condition over its operational life and moreover some vessels such as LNG carriers return in ballast condition in one leg, the effect of <b>trim</b> on ships <b>resistance</b> will be significant. Ship trim optimization analysis has traditionally been done through towing tank testing. Computational techniques have become increasingly popular for design and optimization applications in all engineering disciplines. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), is the fastest developing area in marine fluid dynamics as an alternative to model tests. High fidelity CFD methods are capable of modelling breaking waves which is especially crucial for trim optimisation studies where the bulbous bow partially emerges or the transom stern partially immerses. This paper presents a trim optimization study on the Kriso Container Ship (KCS) using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in conjunction with towing tank tests. A series of resistance tests for various trim angles and speeds were conducted at 1 : 75 scale at design draft. CFD computations were carried out for the same conditions with the hull both fixed and free to sink and trim. Dynamic sinkage and trim add to the computational cost and thus slow the optimisation process. The results obtained from CFD simulations were in good agreement with the experiments. After validating the applicability of the computational model, the same mesh, boundary conditions and solution techniques were used to obtain resistance values for different trim conditions at different Froude numbers. Both the fixed and free trim/sinkage models could predict the trend of resistance with variation of trim angles; however the fixed model failed to measure the absolute values as accurately as the free model. It was concluded that a fixed CFD model, although computationally faster and cheaper, can find the optimum trim angle but cannot predict the amount of savings with very high accuracy. Results concerning the performance of the vessel at different speeds and trim angles were analysed and optimum trim is suggested...|$|R
