50|$|One exploratory, and {{potential}} alternative method {{for the treatment}} of pernicious anemia is the use of transdermal patches. In one such system, the patches are composed of cyanocobalamin, its stabilizers, and epidermal penetration enhancers. The <b>transdermal</b> <b>route</b> allows the cobalamin derivative to passively diffuse through the stratum corneum, epidermis, and dermis, and ultimately entering the bloodstream; hence, the cobalamin avoids the hepatic first pass effect, and so offers the potential for improved bioavailability and efficacy. Slow release increases cobalamin half-life, offering the potential of decreases in required dosage required relative to oral delivery methods. In one such system, a drug-loaded polycaprolactone fiber that is prepared as a electrospun nanofiber can release hundreds of micrograms of cobabalmin per day.|$|E

50|$|To avoid HRT risks, it is {{essential}} to use the most effective delivery method of both estrogen and progesterone. Bioidentical estradiol (estrogen) when taken orally is converted in the liver to estrone, a weaker bioidentical estrogen. However, when estrogen as estradiol is used transdermally as a patch, gel, or pessary, it enters the bloodstream as bioidentical estradiol. When estrogen is ingested it is subjected to first pass metabolism (Phase I drug metabolism) and is processed through the liver. This first pass metabolism stimulates proteins associated with heart disease and stroke, such as C-reactive protein, activated protein C, and clotting factors. Using a patch, gel, or pessary to take estrogen avoids first pass metabolism and the risks associated with it and the same level of blood concentration can be achieved avoiding the serious side effects associated with oral estradiol HRT. Current research shows that the <b>transdermal</b> <b>route</b> of estradiol administration can also be advantageous for women with diabetes, hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors, as those risks increase with advancing age. Women taking bioidentical estrogen, orally or transdermally, who have a uterus should still take a progesterone to lower the risk of endometrial cancer. The plant-derived progesterone creams sold over the counter contain too little progesterone to be effective. Wild yam extract creams are not effective since the natural progesterone present in the extract is not bioavailable.|$|E

The resulting discomfort can for some patients be moro severe than the pain itself, leading to a reduction of analgesic use and consequently to increased pain. Clinical trials consistently show less constipation in patients treated with transdermal fentanyl than in patients receiving oral morphine. Several reasons can be identified for this finding: owing to its higher lipophilicity, fentanyl penetrates the blood-brain barrier more easily and lower dosing is possible; owing to the <b>transdermal</b> <b>route</b> of administration of fentanyl, comparatively less opioid {{is available in the}} gastrointestinal tract to block local opioid receptors; finally, the <b>transdermal</b> <b>route</b> of administration leads to stable plasma levels of fentanyl over 72 h and hence minimises the probability of overdosing that can occur with multiple daily dosing.

40|$|Abstract. The {{susceptibility}} {{of swine}} to infection with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) was assessed. Transmission of EMCV {{in a single}} exposure by gavage or intranasal routes was highly dose dependent. In a direct comparison, animals were exposed to EMCV by gavage, intranasal, intramuscular, intratracheal, or <b>transdermal</b> <b>routes.</b> A higher proportion of animals exposed by transdermal (5 / 5), intratracheal (5 / 5), or intra-muscular (5 / 5) routes than those exposed by intranasal (2 / 5) or gavage (3 / 5) routes became infected. The large quantity of virus required to infect animals intranasally or orally suggests that transmission by these routes may not occur routinely in the field. Transmission of EMCV by wound contamination (transdermally) has not been reported previously. Although EMCV was recovered from rectal, external genitalia, and pharyngeal swabs, {{there was no evidence}} of pig-to-pig transmission of EMCV from experimentally infected animals to comingled sentinels.

Mice were dosed i. p. at 5 dose levels (0. 25 - 20 mg kg- 1) and the oral and <b>transdermal</b> <b>routes</b> of administration were investigated at 20 mg kg- 1. The analytical data produced a good fit to a simple open one-compartment pharmacokinetic model with an elimination half-life of the drug from plasma of between 0. 68 and 0. 88 h over the 0. 25 - 20 mg kg- 1 range covered.

The <b>transdermal</b> <b>route</b> of drug delivery has gained great interest of pharmaceutical research, as it circumvents number of problems associated with oral route of drug administration. The major barrier in transdermal delivery of drug is the skin intrinsic barrier, the stratum corneum, the outermost envelop of the skin that offers the principal hurdle for diffusion of hydrophilic ionisable bioactives. One of the very recent approaches is the use of ultradeformable carrier system (transfersomes®). Which is composed of phospholipid, surfactant, and water for enhanced transdermal delivery? The transfersomal system was much more efficient at delivering a low and high molecular weight drug to the skin in terms of quantity and depth. The system can be characterized by in vitro for vesicle shape and size, entrapment efficiency, degree of deformability, number of vesicles per cubic mm. Transferosome is an ultradeformable vesicle, elastic in nature which can squeeze itself through a pore which is many times smaller than its size owing to its elasticity.

However, clinical trials have failed to show decreased rates of death or disability in intracerebral hemorrhage following hospital initiation of blood pressure control. However, as clinical deterioration often occurs immediately after onset, pre-hospital initiation of blood pressure control may be more ideal. Methods—Relevant terms in the National Library of Medicine PubMed database and selected research including basic science, translational reports, meta-analyses, and clinical studies were searched. Results—Trends indicating improved clinical outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage after hospital-initiated intensive systolic blood pressure control (goal< 140 mmHg) have been demonstrated.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{metabolism}} {{of estrogen}} contained within {{hormone replacement therapy}} (HRT) {{is influenced by the}} route of administration, and this may affect the risk of venous thromboembolism. Thrombin generation, a global coagulation assay, is a marker of hypercoagulability and is of potential use in determining the thrombotic risk associated with particular HRT administration routes. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether any effect of oral and transdermal HRT on thrombin generation is related to the plasma estrogen profile. METHODS: We investigated the effects of oral, transdermal and no HRT (controls) in 52, 39 and 52 postmenopausal women, respectively, on thrombin generation, standard markers of thrombophilia, estradiol level and estrone level. RESULTS: All parameters of thrombin generation were altered in women using oral HRT as compared with controls (P&# 60; 0. 001 for all comparisons). No such differences were found in women using transdermal HRT. Estrone levels correlated with peak thrombin generation (R= 0. 451, P&# 60; 0. 001) in women using oral HRT, but there was no correlation in women using the <b>transdermal</b> <b>route.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Thrombin generation is significantly increased in women who use HRT administered by the oral route. This is probably mediated by the hepatic first-pass metabolism of estrone, the main metabolite of oral estradiol, which is avoided by the <b>transdermal</b> <b>route.</b> The effect of estrone on thrombin generation may provide the explanation for the higher thrombotic risk seen in women using oral rather than transdermal HRT. </p...|$|E

Moreover, transdermal estrogens have not been investigated. METHODS: We examined association of HRT use with ultrasonographically assessed carotid atherosclerotic plaque occurrence and mean common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT) progression. Within the Vascular Aging (EVA) Study, a community-based cohort, 815 postmenopausal women aged 59 - 71 have been followed during 4 years. Among these women, 166 had already used HRT. RESULTS: Women who had ever used HRT experienced a lower occurrence of plaques (8. 6 versus 19. 1 %, P= 0. 003). After adjustment for the main cardiovascular risk factors, odds-ratio for plaque occurrence was 0. 41 (95 % confidence interval 0. 21 - 0. 78, P= 0. 01) among ever users of HRT compared with never users. When <b>transdermal</b> <b>route</b> of estrogen administration was used, adjusted odds-ratio was 0. 66 (95 % confidence interval 0. 47 - 0. 99, P= 0. 04). The progression of IMT, which was measured at a plaque-free site and adjusted on initial levels of CCA-IMT did not differ between ever and never users of HRT.

Design: We designed a prospective, randomized study consisting of four groups of postmenopausal wo-men: group 1 received oral conjugated estrogens, group 2 received a synthethic steroid, group 3 received estradiol nasally in spray form, and group 4 used transdermal estradiol in the form of patches. Criteria used to evaluate effectiveness was the Greene scale, which evaluate six components. These criteria were applied to each patient before hormonal intervention and then each month for 6 months. Luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating horone (FSH) and estradiol concentration were determined by chemiluminescence. Student’s t-test was used for intra-group comparisons before and after treatment. Results: There was a significant decrease in the vasomotor and sexual component (p < 0. 05) with the use of four HT types.

Chitosan biopolymer represents an attractive alternative to other biomaterials because of its significant physicochemical and biological behaviors. Chitosan microspheres are expected to become promising carrier systems for drug and vaccine delivery, especially via oral, mucosal and <b>transdermal</b> <b>routes.</b> Controlling the swelling rate and swelling capacity of the hydrogel and improving the fragile nature of microspheres under acidic conditions are the key challenges {{that need to be}} overcome to allow the use of chitosan microspheres for controlled or sustained release specially via these non-invasive administration routes. There have been many studies on the modification of chitosan microsphere structures with cross-linkers, blends with various kinds of polymers and new organic-inorganic hybrid systems in order to obtain some improved properties. In this work, microspheres composed of chitosan and nanosized hydrophobic silica commercialized under the name Aerosil R 972 were generated by a method consisting of two steps: first, preparation of a macroscopically homogeneous chitosan-hydrophobic silica dispersion by an optimized procedure, and then drying. Spray drying was the technique used here. FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, thermal gravimetric analysis, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and high resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the microspheres, besides acid stability, moisture sorption capacity, release properties and biological assays. The chitosan-hydrophobic silica composite microspheres showed improved thermal degradation, lower water affinity, better acid stability and ability to retard rifampicin (drug model) release under simulated gastric conditions. In vitro biocompatibility studies indicated low cytotoxicity and low capacity to activate cell production of the pro-inflammatory mediator nitric oxide, encouraging further studies {{on the use of the}} new chitosan-hydrophobic silica composite microspheres as drug carrier systems via oral or nasal routes.
