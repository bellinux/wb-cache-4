5|$|Founded as Baith Israel in 1856, the {{congregation}} constructed the first synagogue on Long Island, and hired Aaron Wise {{for his first}} rabbinical position in the United States. Early tensions between traditionalists and reformers led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> forming Congregation Beth Elohim, a Reform synagogue, in 1861.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s {{conflict}} between feminist and traditional members led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> leaving Beth Israel, and forming the Orthodox Congregation Ahavas Torah. Beth Israel {{came under attack}} from neo-Nazi members of the Volksfront twice, in 1994 and again in 2002. In both cases the perpetrators were caught and convicted.|$|E
5|$|On 26 January 945, however, at {{the urging}} of their sister, the Augusta Helena, another coup removed the two Lekapenoi from power under the {{accusation}} that they attempted to poison Constantine VII, and restored the sole imperial authority <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter.</b>|$|E

5|$|Pluteus aurantiorugosus is {{very similar}} to P.nevadensis in {{external}} appearance, and the two can only be reliably distinguished by microscopic characteristics or DNA sequence. In contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> species, the former has oblong spores, and cystidia that are shorter and less slender. P.aurantiorugosus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, but rare.|$|E
5|$|Altar 4 is a {{circular}} monument. It {{was also found}} {{in the northern part of}} the East Plaza and was associated with Stela 4. It depicts three seated prisoners, the central figure is facing to the left while the other two are facing inwards towards him. Hieroglyphic texts are carved underneath the prisoners and upon the sides of the altar. The altar has been dated on stylistic grounds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> part of the 8th century AD.|$|E
5|$|Although both Futurama and The Simpsons {{were created}} by Matt Groening, overt {{references}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> are mostly avoided in Futurama. One of the few exceptions to this rule is the appearance of Blinky, a three-eyed orange fish seen on The Simpsons, as Fry is going through the tube. A running gag of the series is Bender's fondness for Olde Fortran malt liquor, named after Olde English 800 malt liquor and the programming language Fortran. The drink was first introduced in this episode and became so {{closely associated with the}} character that he was featured with a bottle in both the Rocket USA wind-up toy and the action figure released by Moore Action Collectibles.|$|E

5|$|Conn. M-13 {{starts at}} exit164 along I-75/US23 north of Bay City. At the {{interchange}} that marks its southern terminus, the connector route continues {{to the north}} while the main I-75 freeway turns northwesterly. About three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) north, there is an interchange for Wilder Road. Traffic running southbound on the connector that wishes to continue northbound on I-75/US23 has to use Wilder Road to connect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> freeway. The connector route is bordered by fields and residential subdivisions as it continues north to the community of Kawkawlin. The freeway ends at an at-grade intersection with M-13.|$|E
5|$|E. Newton {{noted that}} he had {{expected}} the male would be adorned with a red patch on the wing, but {{that the absence of}} this indicated it was immature. He still found it more beautiful than the female. These two specimens are the only preserved individuals of the species. The mandible and sternum were extracted from the female specimen, and subfossil remains have since been found in the Plaine Corail caverns on Rodrigues. The genus Palaeornis was later declared a junior synonym of Psittacula, and all species within the former were transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter.</b> The genus name Psittacula is derived from the Latin words Psittacus, which means parrot, and -ula, which is a diminutive suffix.|$|E
5|$|Folk {{music is}} {{sometimes}} divided into several spheres of geographic influence, a classification system of three regions, southern, central and northern, proposed by Alan Lomax in 1956 and often repeated. Additionally, Curt Sachs proposed {{the existence of}} two quite distinct kinds of folk music in Europe: continental and Mediterranean, and others have placed the transition zone from the former <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> roughly in north-central Italy, approximately between Pesaro and La Spezia. The central, northern and southern parts of the peninsula each share certain musical characteristics, and are each distinct from the music of Sardinia.|$|E

5|$|Haraldr Guðrøðarson was {{a member}} of the Crovan dynasty, a family of sea-kings who ruled the Mann and parts of the Hebrides from the late {{eleventh}} century to the mid thirteenth century. He was the son of Guðrøðr Rǫgnvaldsson, King of the Isles (died 1231), who was in turn a son of Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles (died 1229). Although the latter monarch may have managed to rule a somewhat independent kingdom, surrounded by formidable Norwegian, Scottish, and English monarchs, his successors fell under the shadow of Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway (died 1263), and rendered tribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> in recognition of Norwegian overlordship.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the {{building}}, several large tenants leased space in the Chrysler Building. The Chrysler Corporation moved into the building in 1930 and used the tower as its division headquarters until the 1950s. The mapmaking company Texaco and the magazine magnate Henry Luce were also two of the original tenants. Texaco moved out in 1977 because it wanted a more suburban workplace in Purchase, New York, for its employees. Luce's company Time Inc. was headquartered in the building until 1937, when it moved to the Rockefeller Center due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> containing more office space.|$|E
5|$|Nishikori and Raonic {{are among}} a group of players whom tennis pundits suggest could be the successors of the Big Four. The members of this group vary, but have {{included}} Grigor Dimitrov, Ernests Gulbis, Marin Cilic, and Dominic Thiem. Raonic holds a positive record against Gulbis and Thiem, having won in all six occasions, but has negative record against Čilić and Dimitrov, most notably having lost in four matches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> in five meetings.|$|E

5|$|Ragnall's {{grant to}} the priory of Paisley is {{preserved}} in two documents: one {{dates to the}} late twelfth- or early thirteenth century, and a later copy is contained in an instrument which dates to 1426. Appended <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> document is {{a description of a}} seal impressed in white wax, which the fifteenth-century notary alleged to have belonged to Ragnall. On one side, the seal is described to have depicted a ship, filled with men-at-arms. On the reverse side, the seal was said to have depicted a man on horseback, armed with a sword in his hand.|$|E
5|$|Real {{people that}} Fox has portrayed include Prince Charles, in Whatever Love Means (2005); Wisley, one of Jane Austen's suitors, in Becoming Jane (2007); and Sir Christopher Hatton, the Lord Chancellor of England in , also {{released}} in 2007. In addition, {{in that year}} Fox was seen on ITV as Cecil Vyse in Andrew Davies' adaptation of A Room with a View based on E.M. Forster's 1908 novel. He has {{expressed a desire to}} appear in a western, and to star as James Bond – the closest he got <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> was losing the role of villain Gustav Graves in Die Another Day (2002) to Toby Stephens.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes are {{the most}} {{important}} rabies vector in Europe. In London, arthritis is not uncommon in foxes, being particularly frequent in the spine. Foxes may be infected with leptospirosis and tularemia, though they are not overly susceptible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter.</b> They may also fall ill from listeriosis and spirochetosis, as well as acting as vectors in spreading erysipelas, brucellosis and tick-born encephalitis. A mysterious fatal disease near Lake Sartlan in the Novosibirsk Oblast was noted among local red foxes, but the cause was undetermined. The possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of encephalomyelitis, which was first observed in captive bred silver foxes. Individual cases of foxes infected with Yersinia pestis are known.|$|E

5|$|The King's Champion {{would then}} throw down the gauntlet; the {{ceremony}} would be repeated at {{the centre of}} the hall and at the High Table (where the sovereign would be seated). The sovereign would then drink to the champion from a gold cup, which he would then present <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter.</b> This ritual was dropped from the coronation of Queen Victoria and was never revived. The offices of Chief Butler of England, Grand Carver of England and Master Carver of Scotland were also associated with the coronation banquet.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of England—which after 1535 {{included}} Wales—ceased being {{a separate}} sovereign state on 1 May 1707, when the Acts of Union {{put into effect}} the terms agreed in the Treaty of Union the previous year, resulting in a political union with the Kingdom of Scotland to create the Kingdom of Great Britain. In 1801, Great Britain was united with the Kingdom of Ireland through another Act of Union to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922 the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{invasion}} of Britain began in AD 43. By 51 the Brigantes had {{submitted to the}} clientship of Rome, eventually being placed under direct rule in the early 70s. Few Roman remains {{have been found in}} the Sheffield area. A minor Roman road linking the Roman forts at Templeborough and Brough-on-Noe possibly ran through the centre of the area covered by the modern city, and Icknield Street is thought to have skirted its boundaries. The routes of these roads within this area are mostly unknown, although sections of the former can still be seen between Redmires and Stanage, and remains possibly linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> were discovered in Brinsworth in 1949.|$|E
