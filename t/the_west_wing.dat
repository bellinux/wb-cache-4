5|$|Adams next had a {{supporting}} role of the teenage nemesis of a movie star (played by Kimberly Davies) in Psycho Beach Party (2000), a horror parody of beach party and slasher films. She played the part as a homage to the actress Ann-Margret. From 2000 to 2002, Adams appeared in guest roles in several television series, including That '70s Show, Charmed, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Smallville, and <b>The</b> <b>West</b> <b>Wing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Sports Night was {{critically}} acclaimed, ABC {{canceled the}} show after two seasons {{due to its}} low ratings. Sorkin entertained offers to continue the show on other television channels but declined all the offers as they were mainly contingent on his involvement {{which would have been}} a difficult prospect given that he was simultaneously writing <b>The</b> <b>West</b> <b>Wing</b> at that point.|$|E
5|$|An {{interior}} rearrangement {{was completed}} around 1942. The women's {{room for the}} main waiting room was moved from the east side to the west side, with one bay added to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>wing.</b> A new dining area was constructed, occupying one-third of the waiting room, with its kitchen occupying the former bathroom space. The lunch cafe and staircases were also modified.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of its {{ownership}} changes the building has been considerably altered, with only the east and south wings retaining their original appearance. Destruction of <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>wing</b> began during the seventeenth century, and the north wing was destroyed in 1812. The Hôtel d'Alluye was classified as a monument historique on 6 November 1929, and its courtyard has been open to the public on European Heritage Days since 2011.|$|E
5|$|Both {{supporters}} and critics of Cheney regard {{him as a}} shrewd and knowledgeable politician who knows the functions and intricacies of the federal government. A sign of Cheney's active policy-making role was then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert's provision of an office near the House floor for Cheney {{in addition to his}} office in <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Wing,</b> his ceremonial office in the Old Executive Office Building, and his Senate offices (one in the Dirksen Senate Office Building and another off the floor of the Senate).|$|E

5|$|Kirkcaldy Town House on Wemyssfield is the centrepiece of the town's civic square. It was {{designed}} in the 1930s by David Carr and William Howard of Edinburgh. World War II stopped work on the building until 1950. Construction was split into two phases: <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>wing,</b> which was completed in 1953, and the east wing, completed in 1956.|$|E
5|$|On 5 February 2009 a fire {{broke out}} at <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>wing</b> on {{the third and fourth}} floor of the College building. Eight London Fire Brigade fire engines were able to bring the flames under control, in the {{meantime}} 35 people were evacuated from the building and a further 100 from adjacent buildings. Fortunately no records or books of the College were damaged. Repairs to the smoke-damaged rooms and exterior brickwork were completed in December 2009.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin {{conceived}} the political drama <b>The</b> <b>West</b> <b>Wing</b> in 1997 {{when he went}} unprepared to a lunch with producer John Wells and in a panic pitched to Wells a series centered on the senior staff of the White House, using leftover ideas from his script for The American President. He told Wells about his visits to the White House while doing research for The American President, and they found themselves discussing public service and {{the passion of the}} people who serve. Wells took the concept and pitched it to the NBC network, but was told to wait because the facts behind the Lewinsky scandal were breaking and there was concern that an audience {{would not be able to}} take a series about the White House seriously. When a year later some other networks started showing interest in <b>The</b> <b>West</b> <b>Wing,</b> NBC decided to greenlight the series despite their previous reluctance. The pilot debuted in the fall of 1999 and was produced by Warner Bros. Television.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>west</b> <b>wing's</b> {{second floor}} {{has a large}} landing with beaded woodwork. It leads to a master bedroom and two smaller bedrooms. The entire floor has its {{original}} wideboard flooring. The roof framing uses king post trusses on the collar ties rather than the more commonly used tie beam formation, a construction visible in the master bedroom.|$|R
50|$|The mall changed {{owners in}} 1997, {{purchased}} by Salisbury Mall Associates, LLC of Baltimore, Maryland. The new owners closed <b>the</b> original <b>west</b> <b>wing</b> of <b>the</b> mall {{in the spring}} of 1998 by erecting a plywood divider to block it off from the eastern wing. The western wing was allowed to quickly deteriorate. Because of the mall's flat roof, leaks were often a problem, and <b>the</b> original <b>west</b> <b>wing</b> was now going without the most basic of upkeep and maintenance.|$|R
50|$|The nuns {{installed}} plumbing in the mansion, enclosed {{the courtyard}} arcades with wood and glass, partially repaired the roof (which later fell into disrepair), and constructed a simple brick garage {{on the property}} behind the mansion. Only the south and <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>wings</b> of <b>the</b> building have basements, which can be accessed by broad wooden staircases directly off the courtyard.|$|R
5|$|The Dibbles' {{house was}} foreclosed around 1897 {{after they were}} unable to pay their taxes, and they moved to Portland, Oregon by 1900. It {{exchanged}} hands several times until 1917, when Gideon and Mary Hart Jones purchased it. The Jones family owned the house until 1933 (and notably added a kitchen which created <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>wing</b> of the house); thus, it was the Jones family who allowed Grant Wood to use their home as a backdrop for American Gothic.|$|E
5|$|The {{basement}} {{housed the}} boiler room, a smaller waiting room, kitchen storerooms, and baggage rooms. The station {{appears to have}} had two side platforms serving four tracks, accessed through a basement-level tunnel that was reached from the main waiting room by a staircase. The steep roof over the center block had several dormers, {{some of which were}} later removed. A covered ramp from <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>wing,</b> which had direct access from the south platform, led to a small trolley station on Glenwood Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The hall has thick flint walls, gabled cross wings, with a Gothic stone {{arch and}} 20th century boarded door and two-storey porch. <b>The</b> <b>west</b> <b>wing</b> {{of the house}} has a stone-framed upper window and large {{attached}} tapered stack. The east wing has sashes dated to the early 19th century. The old fireplace remains in the north, facing room with it roll moulding and steeply pitched head. A chapel in the grounds {{was part of the}} house complex.|$|E
50|$|The Salisbury Mall was {{originally}} anchored by Sears, and Hecht's (then known as The Hecht Co). <b>The</b> mall's <b>west</b> <b>wing</b> spanned 1/10 of a mile.|$|R
