5|$|With Misery we had {{the luxury}} of doing a two-day shoot, which is totally luxurious these days. And we got to do what we love the most, which is just fashion and making {{beautiful}} images, and not having any rules. It was very much on the fly. We went downtown to the abandoned Sears building; it’s all destroyed and creepy in <b>there.</b> <b>We</b> were there for two days and it was like an art project.|$|E
5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years <b>there.</b> <b>We</b> had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E

60|$|I {{was quite}} persuaded that <b>we</b> were <b>there</b> when <b>we</b> were ten miles off, and when <b>we</b> really were <b>there,</b> that <b>we</b> should never get <b>there.</b> However, when <b>we</b> began to jolt upon a stone pavement, and {{particularly}} when every other conveyance {{seemed to be}} running into us, and we seemed to be running into every other conveyance, I began {{to believe that we}} really were approaching the end of our journey. Very soon afterwards we stopped.|$|R

Vigon agrees to move his troops for blocking all streets south of Guernica. If this succeeds, we will have trapped the enemy around Marquina.|$|E
25|$|The roundarm {{controversy}} {{came to a}} head {{before the}} 1827 season and MCC agreed to the staging of three trial matches between Sussex and All-England. Roundarm's supporters made the grandiose claim that their campaign was a march of intellect. It is difficult to discern anything intellectual about propelling a cricket ball with arm outstretched vis-à-vis propelling it with hand below elbow, but <b>there</b> <b>we</b> are. What the bowlers were really after was of course to claim an advantage over the batsmen.|$|E
25|$|The {{chronology}} {{of the site}} starts at ~600 BCE and lasts until ~1500 CE The first two phases are weakly defined and things don’t solidify until the Ichpa phase, which lines up with the Early Classic Period and is consequently the first agreed upon phase. There is polychrome pottery characteristic of the region in that time period, and hieroglyphics. The Noheb phase lines up with the Middle Classic and <b>there</b> <b>we</b> see polychrome pottery disappears along with any sort of stone inscriptions, {{and the construction of}} large pyramids begins. In the Ukmul phase, hieroglyphics re-emerge and there is an abundance of rich detailed iconography. The Nak phase is a high point, with the building of the most 'glamorous' architecture, and Pre-pizarran ceramics emerge, characterized by supporting conical feet but displaying a broad diversity in design otherwise. Finally the Tokoy phase is defined by a disappearance in all evidence of human activity, except for pottery with a deterioration in materials and in consistency in technique, which fades out completely towards 1500 CE.|$|E

25|$|Baker-Carr {{recalled}} Wilson {{standing in}} dressing gown and slippers uttering “sardonic little jests to all and sundry within earshot” as GHQ packed up to evacuate, behaviour which historian Dan Todman comments was probably “reassuring for some but profoundly irritating for others”. Macready recorded Wilson (27 August) “walking slowly up and down” {{the room at}} Noyon which had been commandeered as headquarters with a “comical, whimsical expression”, clapping his hands and chanting “We shall never get <b>there,</b> <b>we</b> shall never get there … to the sea, to the sea, to the sea”, although he also recorded that this was probably intended {{to keep up the}} spirits of more junior officers. His infamous “sauve qui peut” order to Snow, GOC 4th Division, (27 August) ordering unnecessary ammunition and officers’ kits to be dumped so that tired and wounded soldiers could be carried, was, according to Swinton, probably intended out of concern for the soldiers rather than out of panic. Smith-Dorrien was later rebuked by French for countermanding it. Lord Loch thought the order showed “GHQ had lost their heads” whilst General Haldane thought it “a mad order” (both in their diaries for 28 August). Major-General Pope-Hennessey later alleged (in the 1930s) that Wilson had ordered the destruction of orders issued during the retreat to hide the degree of panic.|$|E
