40|$|The {{simulation}} studies {{presented by}} Nelsen and Winter (1982) examine the modelling of industry dynamics. These studies are a prominent and unique approach visualizing innovation and imitation processes. Assuming {{the standard model}} envisages firms acting individually, this paper treats the question concerning how the dynamic of the market changes {{in the case of}} inter-firm cooperation. Thereby we refer to one of our case studies (Brunner / Voigt 2008) and reconstruct interactions between <b>the</b> <b>cooperation</b> participants. On <b>the</b> one hand, we extend the Nelson-Winter-model by a factor market where <b>the</b> <b>cooperation</b> is able to bundle its demand. On the other hand, the model is enlarged by interactions of <b>the</b> <b>cooperation</b> actors in terms of innovation and imitation processes. A fundamental result of the simulation studies is that <b>the</b> <b>cooperation</b> participants improve their market position due to <b>the</b> <b>cooperation.</b> In particular, this study shows how <b>the</b> <b>cooperation</b> supports and simultaneously accelerates the dissemination of innovation. ...|$|R

That means it is difficult to predict that which members among all other members will respond to <b>the</b> <b>cooperation</b> leader, because all of them are likely to have equal chances to response. Based on the proposed assumptions, the experiments with two pilot studies are conducted. The leadership perceptions observed from team members are compared with the computed measure of uncertainty. The results show that the measure of uncertainty will be able to represent the leadership perceptions from team members. However, more experiment for the future work is still required...|$|R
