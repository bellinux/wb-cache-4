25|$|An {{alternative}} framework {{has more}} recently been {{put forward by}} Wilken and Ma (2004) who suggest that apparent capacity limitations in VSTM are caused by a monotonic decline {{in the quality of}} the internal representations stored (i.e., monotonic increase in noise) as a function of set-size. In this conception capacity limitations in memory are not caused by a limit on the number of things that can be encoded, but by a decline in the quality of the representation of each thing as more things are added to memory. In their 2004 experiments, they varied color, spatial frequency, and orientation of objects stored in VSTM using a signal detection theory approach (see also the closely related work by Palmer, 1990). <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to report differences between the visual stimuli presented to them in consecutive order. The investigators found that different stimuli were encoded independently and in parallel, and that the major factor limiting report performance was neuronal noise (which is a function of visual set-size).|$|E
25|$|A poll {{conducted}} in Moldova by IMAS-Inc Chișinău in October 2009 presented a somewhat detailed {{picture of the}} perception of identity inside the country. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to rate {{the relationship between the}} identity of Moldovans and that of Romanians on a scale between 1 (entirely the same) to 5 (completely different). The poll shows that 26% of the entire sample, which includes all ethnic groups, claim the two identities are the same or very similar, whereas 47% claim they are different or entirely different. The results vary significantly among different categories of subjects. For instance, 33% of the young respondents (ages 18–29) chose the same or very similar, and 44% different or very different. Among the senior respondents (aged over 60), the corresponding figures were 18.5% and 53%. One of the largest deviation from the country average was among the residents of capital Chișinău, for whom the figures were 42% and 44%. The poll also shows that, compared to the national average (25%), {{people are more likely to}} perceive the two identities as the same or very similar if they are young (33%), are native speakers of Romanian (30%), have higher education (36%) or reside in urban areas (30%), especially in the capital city (42%).|$|E
2500|$|Likewise, {{the study}} The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making (2011) {{indicated}} that participants rated 80 names and 80 paintings [...] {{based on how}} much they liked the name {{and how much they}} liked painting. To give meaning to the decisions, <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to select names that they might give to their children. For rating the paintings, <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to base their ratings on whether or not they would display such art at home.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> to read {{a series}} of related word-reading and color-naming trials. In the first {{component}} of the task, known as the word-reading condition of <b>the</b> task, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> {{to read a}}s quickly as possible a series of color names printed either in white or other various colors. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> then <b>asked</b> to name the color of a series of colored blocks.|$|R

30|$|Before {{starting}} <b>the</b> experiment, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> {{to complete}} a brief questionnaire, e.g., age, music preference, etc. After completing the questionnaire the experiment started with the assignment explained in the instructions.|$|R
30|$|Make International Call: <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> to dial {{a long-distance}} {{telephone}} number {{and leave a}} message provided by the experimenter. Dialing a long-distance call may have a high cost associated with it compared to making a local call, which allowed us to explore participant opinions on financial risks. This task also allowed another speaker verification match or non-match, much like as described for the Make Local Call task. Change Device PIN: <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> to change <b>the</b> device PIN. This task was included to assess how <b>participants</b> perceive <b>the</b> value of the PIN mechanism and the security it provides.|$|R

50|$|Moreover, in Washing Away Your Sins: Threatened Morality and Physical Cleansing (2006), {{the results}} {{indicated}} that a person washing his or her hands is an action that helps resolve post-decisional cognitive dissonance, because the mental stress usually was caused by the person's ethical-moral self-disgust, which is an emotion related to the physical disgust caused by a dirty environment. Likewise, the study The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making (2011) indicated that participants rated 80 names and 80 paintings based on how much they liked the name and how much they liked painting. To give meaning to the decisions, <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to select names that they might give to their children.

50|$|In {{a series}} of {{experiments}} by Evans, Barston and Pollard (1983), participants were presented with evaluation task paradigms, containing two premises and a conclusion. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to make an evaluation of logical validity. The subjects, however, exhibited a belief bias, evidenced by their tendency to reject valid arguments with unbelievable conclusions, and endorse invalid arguments with believable conclusions. Instead of following directions and assessing logical validity, the subjects based their assessments on personal beliefs.|$|E
30|$|Lower body muscular {{endurance}} {{was measured}} using a 1 -minute sit-stand test. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> to perform as many sit-stand movements as possible in 1  minute.

50|$|The 2013 {{event was}} a month-long BBC series {{that took place}} in October. The series {{examined}} {{the role of women in}} the 21st century and culminated in an event held at BBC Broadcasting House in London, United Kingdom on 25 October 2013 involving a hundred women from around the world, all of whom came from different walks of life. The day featured debate and discussion on radio, television and online, in which <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to give their opinions about the issues facing women.|$|E
50|$|A week later, all of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> {{whether of}} not {{there had been}} any broken glass in the video. A {{statistically}} significant amount of participants in group B answered that they remembered seeing broken glass in the video (p < -.05). However, there was not any broken glass in the video. The difference between this group and the others {{was that they were}} primed with the word “smashed” in the questionnaire, one week prior to answering the question. By changing one word in the questionnaire, their memories were re-encoded with new details.|$|E
30|$|Self-assessment stress evaluation. It {{was carried}} out {{immediately}} after each scenario, while viewing back-recorded video sequences. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> to quantify his stress level from 0 to 100 using a haptic 3 D wheel navigator (3 Dconnexion Space Navigator) and a proprietary software (Autoconfrontation V 1.0. 4, BCom, Brest, France).|$|R
5000|$|The {{presentation}} is immediately {{followed by the}} mental arithmetic component, during which <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> to count backwards from 1,022 in steps of 13.

5000|$|Reporting the TBR Event from Different Perspectives: <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> {{to report}} <b>the</b> event from several {{different}} perspectives; {{like that of}} another witness or even a <b>participant.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> witnessed a robbery, the interviewer may ask ‘What {{do you think the}} cashier saw?’ and then ask for <b>the</b> <b>participant’s</b> perspective.|$|R
50|$|Context {{effects are}} not {{explained}} by bottom-up theories of accounting. Irving Biederman performed experiments that demonstrated dramatic context effects. For example, Stephen Palmer carried out {{an experiment in}} which <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to identify objects after they were shown either a relevant or irrelevant context. They might be shown a scene of a baseball game, followed by images of a baseball, car, and a phone. The stimuli that was most relevant to the context, the baseball, was recognized quicker than those that were irrelevant, car and phone.|$|E
50|$|In {{the next}} stage of the research, the {{participants}} were given more information about the study described on the card they received, including details of the research, critiques of the research, and the researchers' responses to those critiques. The participants' degree of commitment to their original positions were re-measured, and <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> {{about the quality of the}} research and the effect the research had on their beliefs. Finally, the trial was rerun on all participants using a card that supported the opposite position to that they had initially seen.|$|E
