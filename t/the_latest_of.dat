5|$|The first county {{courthouse}} {{was a small}} log building. When Corydon became the territory capital in 1813, county and territorial officials shared the building. By 1816 a stone building had been constructed, and it served as both Harrison County Courthouse and the state capital building until the capital was moved.

In the 1920s, <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>of</b> these office buildings was razed {{to make way for}} a new courthouse; the old building was acquired by the State of Indiana and preserved as the first state capitol building.

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{electrophysiological}} aspects of the hyperkinetic syndrome, <b>the</b> <b>late</b> component <b>of</b> CNV (CNV immediately before S(2) for 200 msec) and reaction time (RT) were measured in 15 patients with hyperkinetic syndrome, 15 patients with emotional disturbance, and 30 normal children, all 7 - 12 years old. In the normal children <b>the</b> <b>late</b> component <b>of</b> CNV increased in amplitude, while RT was shortened, as the age increased. <b>The</b> <b>late</b> component <b>of</b> CNV was considered to attain a level {{comparable to that of}} adults by the age of approximately 9 years. Only in the cases of hyperkinetic syndrome was <b>the</b> <b>late</b> component <b>of</b> CNV significantly low in amplitude. As to RT, however, no significant difference was observed among the three groups. In the hyperkinetic children, significant correlation was observed neither between IQ and <b>the</b> <b>late</b> component <b>of</b> CNV, nor between the normal and abnormal EEG groups and <b>the</b> <b>late</b> component <b>of</b> CNV and RT. Comparing responders with nonresponders to methylphenidate, it was found that <b>the</b> <b>late</b> component <b>of</b> CNV of the responders was significantly lower in amplitude than that of the nonresponders, but no such difference in RT was observed.
