5|$|As Julio made landfall, it {{produced}} lightning and locally heavy rainfall, which left {{more than a}} dozen communities isolated due to flooding. The flooding damaged several houses and killed two people. Winds were generally light, although strong enough to damage a few electrical poles and small buildings. In nearby Sinaloa, rainfall from the storm led <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> evacuation of 500 residents.|$|E
5|$|On 28 January 2008, {{the drive}} shaft of a Danish AW101 broke, leading <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> landing at Billund Airport. Following the incident, the Danish fleet was {{grounded}} {{as a precaution}} and the AW101's future was publicly debated. In {{the first six months}} of 2008, the RDAF reported an operational availability of roughly 50%, well below the target of 80%, partly due to an inadequate maintenance organisation and staff shortages.|$|E
5|$|In {{the city}} of Puerto Cabezas, {{population}} 60,000, meteorologists expected a direct hit. Local authorities announced a curfew to prevent looting. The government also cut off electricity throughout the small coastal city to prevent injuries. Evacuations were limited, and the most vulnerable of the population weathered the storm in poorly constructed shelters. To {{be able to respond}} <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> following Beta, the government of Nicaragua requested relief supplies for 41,866 families which would last 15 days. These supplies consisted of 98,000lb (44,452kg) of cereals, 628,600lb (285,128kg) of beans, 628,600lb (285,128kg) of corn, 125,7200lb (57,025kg) of rice, 44,500lb (20,184kg) of sugar, 171,600lb (77,836kg) of salt, 4,929gal (18,658L) of cooking oil, 324,900lb (147,372kg) of milk and 21,264 blankets.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} protest in Ottawa, {{the capital city}} of Canada, took place on 4 February 2009 at Parliament Hill in an effort to attract the {{attention}} of Canada's parliament members. Thousands of Tamils gathered in front of the Peace Tower, subsequently drawing out a few politicians from inside, notably Bev Oda and New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jack Layton. Layton announced that he would call parliament <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> debate at the House of Commons. Oda announced that the government would provide financial aid to the affected civilians, with the help of World Vision and Médecins Sans Frontières.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{decipher}} Nedry's code to reactivate the security system, Hammond and the park's chief engineer Ray Arnold opt to reboot the entire park's system. The group shuts down the park's grid and retreats <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> bunker, while Arnold heads to a maintenance shed {{to complete the}} rebooting process. When Arnold fails to return, Sattler and Muldoon head to the shed. They discover the shutdown has deactivated the remaining fences and released the raptors. Muldoon distracts the raptors, while Sattler goes to turn the power back on, before being attacked by a raptor and discovering Arnold's severed arm. Meanwhile, Muldoon is caught off-guard and killed by the other two raptors.|$|E
5|$|Delaney had {{a lifelong}} history of helping others, and once {{paid for the}} funeral of a former teacher whose family could not afford a proper service. On June 29, 1983, Delaney, who was living in nearby Ruston, went with friends to Critter's Creek, an {{amusement}} center at Chennault Park in Monroe, Louisiana. While reportedly discouraging swimming children from venturing too far out in a pond, Delaney dove in to save three children who were screaming for help, floundering in a water hole left by recent construction work. The water hole, which covered two acres and was six feet deep, was not intended for swimming but {{to add to the}} park's aesthetics. Despite his inability to swim, Delaney nevertheless tried to rescue the children. One child managed {{to get out of the}} water without harm and another was taken <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> room where he later died; police recovered the body of Delaney and the remaining child. The amusement park has since been closed to the public.|$|E

5|$|On 8 August 1993, Mills and Mincione {{walked to}} the corner of De Vere Gardens and Kensington Road, London, but while {{crossing}} Kensington Road, Mills was knocked down by a police motorcycle, the last in a convoy of three, which was responding <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> call. Mills suffered crushed ribs, a punctured lung, and the loss of her left leg 6inches below the knee; a metal plate was later attached to her pelvis. In October 1993, she had another operation that further shortened her leg. Mills was awarded £200,000 by the police authority as recompense for her injuries, even though the police motorcyclist, PC Osbourne, was later cleared by magistrates of driving without due care and attention. After the accident, Mills sold her story to the News of the World, and gave other interviews, saying she earned £180,000. She used the money to set up the Heather Mills Health Trust (existed 2000–2004) which delivered prosthetic limbs to people, particularly children, who had lost limbs after stepping on landmines. Mills often shows people her prosthetic leg, once taking it off during an interview on the American talk show Larry King Live, in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins in}} 2011 with Cocoro {{traveling}} to SPHIA to interview Inubushi, when her plane experiences turbulence and crashes on Mount Akakura. Yuni and Yomogi get the unconscious Cocoro and Mayuzumi <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> cabin to take {{shelter from the}} blizzard. In 2012, Satoru falls from the SPHIA facility's clock tower and loses consciousness. Cocoro wakes up {{in a room and}} is relieved to find that Yuni is safe. Yuni does not recognize her; when looking at herself in a mirror, she sees a man's body. Similarly, Satoru wakes up in a woman's body. Both eventually switch back to their respective bodies, but the phenomenon continues, with their minds moving between their bodies; they conclude that their consciousnesses are transcending time and space. In the cabin, a news article dated July 4, 2011 is found, which says that Yuni was the only survivor, with the other three having died in an avalanche on January 17. Satoru finds a key in his room, but does not know what it unlocks.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{believing the}} Iraqi Army would only {{advance to the}} Ramallah oil field, Schwarzkopf was {{surprised}} when the Iraqis captured Kuwait City. Fearing Iraq would next invade Saudi Arabia, Schwarzkopf ordered contingency plans put in motion, with the 82nd Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division and 24th Infantry Division put on alert. He was then called <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> meeting with President George H. W. Bush, where his Internal Look '90 strategic plans were made {{the basis of a}} potential counteroffensive plan. By August 5, Bush opted for an aggressive response to the invasion. Schwarzkopf then accompanied Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to meet with Saudi King Fahd to convince him to allow U.S. troops into Saudi Arabia to counter the Iraqi military. With Fahd's consent, Bush ordered troops into Saudi Arabia on August 7, initially tasked to defend Saudi Arabia should Iraq attack. U.S. commanders from the beginning wanted a quick conflict characterized by decisive, overwhelming force, as opposed to the gradual escalation of U.S. involvement as had been seen in Vietnam. Schwarzkopf in particular was very adamant that many of the policies governing military operations in Vietnam, especially slow escalation of air power and troop force, not reoccur. His plan for direct and overwhelming force was initially criticized in Washington as uncreative. By August 13, the news media began to closely cover Schwarzkopf, who had been named to lead the operation.|$|E
