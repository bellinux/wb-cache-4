5|$|The {{life-cycle}} {{assessment of}} bismuth {{will focus on}} solders, {{one of the major}} uses of bismuth, and the one with the most complete information. The average primary energy use for solders is around 200 MJ per kg, with the high-bismuth solder (58% Bi) only 20% of that value, and three low-bismuth solders (2% to 5% Bi) running very close to the average. <b>The</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> potential averaged 10 to 14kg carbon dioxide, with the high-bismuth solder about two-thirds of that and the low-bismuth solders about average. The acidification potential for the solders is around 0.9 to 1.1kg sulfur dioxide equivalent, with the high-bismuth solder and one low-bismuth solder only one-tenth of the average and the other low-bismuth solders about average.|$|E

25|$|The annual {{global warming}} {{potential}} of tropospheric ozone is between 918–1022 tons carbon dioxide equivalent/tons tropospheric ozone.

However, tropospheric ozone is a short-lived greenhouse gas, which decays in the atmosphere {{much more quickly than}} carbon dioxide.

On June 26, 2012, the court issued an opinion which dismissed the challenges to the EPA's endangerment finding and the related GHG regulations.

25|$|One {{approach}} {{to address the}} problem of waste PVC is also through the process called Vinyloop. It is a mechanical recycling process using a solvent to separate PVC from other materials. This solvent turns in a closed loop process in which the solvent is recycled. Recycled PVC is used in place of virgin PVC in various applications: coatings for swimming pools, shoe soles, hoses, diaphragms tunnel, coated fabrics, PVC sheets. This recycled PVC's primary energy demand is 46 percent lower than conventional produced PVC. So the use of recycled material leads to a significant better ecological footprint. <b>The</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> potential is 39 percent lower.|$|E
25|$|On September 27, 2006, Schwarzenegger signed <b>the</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Warming</b> Solutions Act of 2006, {{creating}} the nation's first cap on greenhouse gas emissions.

Schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in California from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state's greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce California's emissions by 25 percent to 1990s levels by 2020. In 2005, Schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> {{controversy}} {{concerns the}} public debate over whether global warming is occurring, how much has occurred in modern times, what has caused it, what its effects will be, whether any action {{should be taken to}} curb it, and if so what that action should be. In the scientific literature, there is a strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view, though a few organizations with members in extractive industries hold non-committal positions. Disputes over the key scientific facts of global warming are more prevalent in the media than in the scientific literature, where such issues are treated as resolved, and such disputes are more prevalent in the United States than globally.|$|E
25|$|An {{early success}} in the {{recycling}} of plastics is Vinyloop, an industrial process to separate PVC from other materials through dissolution, filtration and separation of contaminants. A solvent is used in a closed loop to elute PVC from the waste. This {{makes it possible to}} recycle composite PVC waste, which is normally incinerated or put in a landfill. Vinyloop-based recycled PVC's primary energy demand is 46 percent lower than conventionally produced PVC. <b>The</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> potential is 39 percent lower. This is why the use of recycled material leads to a significantly better ecological outcome. This process was used after the Olympic Games in London 2012. Parts of temporary Buildings like the Water Polo Arena and the Royal Artillery Barracks were recycled. In this way, the PVC Policy could be fulfilled, which says that no PVC waste should be left after the games had ended.|$|E
25|$|The Paleolithic {{is often}} held to finish {{at the end}} of the ice age (the end of the Pleistocene epoch), and Earth's climate became warmer. This may have caused or contributed to the {{extinction}} of the Pleistocene megafauna, although it is also possible that the late Pleistocene extinctions were (at least in part) caused by other factors such as disease and overhunting by humans. New research suggests that the extinction of the woolly mammoth may have been caused by the combined effect of climatic change and human hunting. Scientists suggest that climate change during the end of the Pleistocene caused the mammoths' habitat to shrink in size, resulting in a drop in population. The small populations were then hunted out by Paleolithic humans. <b>The</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> that occurred during the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene may have made it easier for humans to reach mammoth habitats that were previously frozen and inaccessible. Small populations of wooly mammoths survived on isolated Arctic islands, Saint Paul Island and Wrangel Island, until BCE and BCE respectively. The Wrangel Island population became extinct around the same time the island was settled by prehistoric humans. There is no evidence of prehistoric human presence on Saint Paul island (though early human settlements dating as far back as 6500 BCE were found on the nearby Aleutian Islands).|$|E
