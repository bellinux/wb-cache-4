However, Tsing Tsung never does return, and alone again Sum studies the manual in memory of her lover, having no previous experience of qi cultivation and therefore no preconceptions of how to interpret the manual, Sum succeeds where generations of Wudang practitioners have failed and acquires qi powers that surpass even that of both her husband and lover.|$|R
5000|$|Possessives are {{sometimes}} {{regarded as a}} grammatical case (the possessive case), although they are also sometimes considered to represent the genitive case, or are not assigned to any case, depending on which language is being considered. On the other hand, some languages, such as the Cariban languages, {{can be said to}} have a possessed case, used to indicate the other party (the <b>thing</b> possessed) <b>in</b> a <b>possession</b> relationship. A similar feature found in some languages is the possessive affix, usually a suffix, added to the (possessed) noun to indicate the possessor, as in the Finnish taloni ("my house"), where talo means [...] "house" [...] and the suffix -ni means [...] "my".|$|R

60|$|There {{is perhaps}} no {{phenomenon}} {{of nature that}} is at once so important, so universal; and so little understood, as the struggle for existence continually going on among all organised beings. To most persons nature appears calm, orderly, and peaceful. They see the birds singing in the trees, the insects hovering over the flowers, the squirrel climbing among the tree-tops, and all living <b>things</b> <b>in</b> the <b>possession</b> of health and vigour, and in the enjoyment of a sunny existence. But they do not see, and hardly ever think of, the means by which this beauty and harmony and enjoyment is brought about. They do not see the constant and daily search after food, the failure to obtain which means weakness or death; the constant effort to escape enemies; the ever-recurring struggle against the forces of nature. This daily and hourly struggle, this incessant warfare, is nevertheless the very means by which much of the beauty and harmony and enjoyment in nature is produced, and also affords {{one of the most important}} elements in bringing about the origin of species. We must, therefore, devote some time to the consideration of its various aspects and of the many curious phenomena to which it gives rise.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> law, <b>possession</b> is {{the control}} a person {{intentionally}} exercises toward a <b>thing.</b> <b>In</b> all cases, to possess something, a person {{must have an}} intention to possess it. A person may be <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> of some property (although possession does not always imply ownership). Like ownership, the possession of things is commonly regulated by states under property law.|$|R
2500|$|Ulrich Niemann, a Jesuit priest, {{doctor and}} psychiatrist, whom priests call in {{exorcism}} cases, told The Washington Post in 2005, [...] "As a doctor, I {{say there is}} no such <b>thing</b> as <b>possession...</b> <b>In</b> my view, these patients are mentally ill. I pray with them, but that alone doesn't help. You have to deal with them as a psychiatrist. But at the same time, when the patient comes from Eastern Europe and believes that he's been impaired by evil, {{it would be a mistake}} to ignore his belief system." [...] Niemann further said that he does not think he is an exorcist and does not perform the Roman ritual of 1614. Academic Heike Schwarz says her case showed demonic possession as a variation of multiple personality disorder.|$|R

Now his conscience began to prick him. He asked himself whether he had any right to encourage her, whether he ought not rather to warn her. He asked her mother: [...] "Has she been doing {{this sort of thing}} long?" ...|$|R

60|$|Yet was Charles Millthorpe as affectionate and dutiful a boy as ever {{boasted of}} his brain, and knew {{not that he}} possessed a far more {{excellent}} and angelical <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the <b>possession</b> of a generous heart. His father died; to his family he resolved to be a second father, and a careful provider now. But not by hard toil of his hand; but by gentler practices of his mind. Already he had read many books--history, poetry, romance, essays, and all. The manorial book-shelves had often been honored by his visits, and Pierre had kindly been his librarian. Not to lengthen the tale, {{at the age of}} seventeen, Charles sold the horse, the cow, the pig, the plow, the hoe, and almost every movable thing on the premises; and, converting all into cash, departed with his mother and sisters for the city; chiefly basing his expectations of success on some vague representations of an apothecary relative there resident. How he and his mother and sisters battled it out; how they pined and half-starved for a while; how they took in sewing; and Charles took in copying; and all but scantily sufficed for a livelihood; all this may be easily imagined. But some mysterious latent good-will of Fate toward him, had not only thus far kept Charles from the Poor-House, but had really advanced his fortunes in a degree. At any rate, that certain harmless presumption and innocent egotism which have been previously adverted to as sharing in his general character, these had by no means retarded him; for it is often to be observed of the shallower men, that they are the very last to despond. It is the glory of the bladder that nothing can sink it; it is the reproach of a box of treasure, that once overboard it must down.|$|R
50|$|Property, in {{the first}} instance, is a thing-in-itself. When a person finds a thing and takes that thing into that person's {{possession}} and control, then that thing becomes a thing-for-you for that person. Once the person has that <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> that person's <b>possession,</b> that thing becomes that person's property by reason of discovery and conquest, and that person has the individual right to defend that property (property interest) against all others by reason of self-help. Typically, persons join {{together to form a}} political state which may develop a formal legal system which enforces and protects property rights so that the individual can go to court to get protection and enforcement of that person's property rights, rather than having to use self-help. It is possible that when a person has constructive possession of personal property, but another person has actual possession, then the person having constructive possession has bare legal title, while the other person has actual possession. Generally, the ground and any buildings which are permanently attached are considered real property, while movable goods and intangibles such as a copyright are considered personal property. Also, property cannot be considered a reified concept, because {{in the first}} instance, property is very concrete as a physical thing-in-itself.|$|R

50|$|Punishments for minors <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> {{vary greatly}} from state-to-state.

All the horrors and all the crimes of the anarchy which led to their Revolution, which attend its progress, and which may virtually attend it in its establishment, pass for nothing with the lovers of revolutions.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Interdisciplinary Design Institute, Washington State UniversityAttachment to {{possessions}} {{is commonly}} {{understood as a}} close association that an individual perceives between him/herself and a specific object <b>in</b> his/her <b>possession.</b> Attachment objects {{play an important role}} in people's life beyond their utility. They are used to define individual and group identity, display affiliation to or differentiation from others, express social status and life style, establish political and social order, influence interpersonal relationship and enable self-development to name a few. Previous research in this field has been mainly focused on the different dimensions of attachment concept (such as attachment motivation) and how owners' demographic differences impact the attachment bond. Despite the volume of research in this field there is a lack of understanding about the influence that objects have on attachment bond. Particularly the effect of the new class of technology devices that are emerging on the grounds of the Internet of Things (IoT) is not well investigated. Today as more and more objects connect to the internet it is important to acknowledge their uniqueness and be proactive in understanding them as forces of change in our life. This study first hypothesizes that, possession attachment is influenced by the attachment object's characteristics and second, there are noticeable differences between connected objects (C-Things) and not-connected material objects (<b>Things)</b> <b>in</b> terms of <b>possession</b> attachment. To test the research hypotheses a mixed-method approach was adopted to be able to collect, analyze, cross verify and report findings. This research approach included a qualitative exploratory interview followed by a quantitative survey that was administered online. The results of this study provide a rich picture of <b>possession</b> attachment <b>in</b> great details. Variety of aspects related to the concept of possession attachment are identified, operationalized and measured including, time, value to the user, love and loss emotions, replaceability and attachment behavior. In addition to providing a phenomenological understanding of possession attachment, the results demonstrate salient differences between Things and Connected <b>Things</b> <b>in</b> many of the identified aspects and therefore support the hypotheses of this research.
