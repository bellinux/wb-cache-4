5|$|Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria {{traveled}} aboard Viribus Unitis in late June 1914 {{en route}} to Bosnia to observe military maneuvers. On 25 June, he boarded <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> Trieste Harbor and travelled {{to the mouth of}} the Neretva River, where he transferred to another vessel. On 30 June, two days after Ferdinand and his wife were killed by Gavrilo Princip in the Bosnian city of Sarajevo, Viribus Unitis transported their bodies back to Trieste.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{managed to}} right <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> 1994. While the quarterback {{situation}} had not stabilized, the defense {{led the league}} in fewest points allowed. The Browns finished 11–5, making the playoffs {{for the first time in}} five years. The Browns beat the Patriots in a wild-card game, but arch-rival Pittsburgh won a 29–9 victory in the divisional playoff, ending the Browns' season.|$|E
5|$|In October 1864 Stanley {{contracted}} diphtheria while Josephine {{was still}} grieving for Eva. She {{was suffering from}} depression and was in poor health. After the worst of Stanley's ailment passed, Josephine decided {{to take him to}} Naples for them both to rest and recuperate. <b>The</b> <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> which they travelled down the west coast of Italy faced rough weather, and Josephine had a physical breakdown on board from which she nearly died.|$|E

5|$|Schoolteacher Lawrence Beesley, {{a science}} master at Dulwich College, {{spent much of}} his time aboard <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> the library. Two months after the sinking, he wrote and {{published}} The Loss of the SS Titanic, the first eyewitness account of the disaster.|$|E
5|$|Seven minutes later, {{two other}} high-calibre shells struck the Bretagne {{at the same}} time. The first detonated {{at the base of}} the tripod mast, igniting some {{ready-to-use}} anti-aircraft projectiles which were stored in lockers next to the anti-aircraft mounts. The second went through the central 138 mm casement, exploding deep inside the ship. A fire started, with leaking oil burning next to <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> <b>In</b> about thirty seconds, the ship rolled and exploded.|$|E
5|$|Tegetthoff {{was laid}} down in 1876 at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{shipyard}} in Trieste. The ship was launched in 1878, and completed in 1881. She conducted her sea trials in October of that year, and was finally ready for commissioning in September 1882; Kaiser Franz Joseph attended the commissioning of <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> Pola. Financial difficulties had again delayed the ship's completion; the parliament finally voted to allocate funds to finish <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> November 1881. At the time, she was {{the largest and most}} powerful ship in the Austro-Hungarian fleet, and she would keep that distinction until {{after the turn of the}} century. She was, nevertheless, a political compromise, and was much smaller than foreign casemate ships, particularly British and French vessels.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of effective time-delay shells {{at the end}} of World War I made this scheme much less effective, as the intact shell would penetrate layers of weak armour and explode deep inside <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> <b>In</b> addition, she was grossly overweight compared to her original design, making her a wet ship with a highly stressed structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the crew lived on the single gun deck of the Warrior; these crewmen slept in hammocks slung from the sides and deck beams, with up to 18 men between each pair of guns. The officers berthed {{in the rear of}} <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> small individual cabins; the wardroom was also the officers' mess. The captain had two spacious, well-furnished cabins.|$|E
5|$|When France {{surrendered}} on 22 June, {{two ships}} were in French Algeria, one was refitting in Toulon {{and the last}} ship was in England. During Operation Catapult in July, {{an attack on the}} Vichy Fleet intended to prevent it from being turned over to the Germans, the British seized <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> England, but failed to prevent the two in Mers-el-Kébir from escaping to Toulon when they attacked the port.|$|E
50|$|Nothing was said, however, of {{the fleet}} {{captured}} at Lisbon itself. The Portuguese government protested, and Roussin proposed that <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> be re-purchased for 1.5 million cruzados, or to return half <b>the</b> captured <b>ships,</b> <b>in</b> exchange for <b>the</b> release of 400 political prisoners. When this offer was rejected, <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> <b>in</b> question were incorporated in the French fleet.|$|R

5|$|A {{particularly}} severe {{outbreak of}} malaria struck <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> early February 1804; 212 members of Bellerophons crew fell ill. 17 died aboard the ship, while 100 had {{to be transferred to}} a shore-based hospital, where a further 40 died. She was ordered back to Britain in June, escorting a large convoy, and arrived in the Downs on 11 August. She briefly paid off and was taken into Portsmouth Dockyard for a refit. On 27 September four shipwrights working in magazine by candle light set off some loose powder. The explosion killed all four.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Hipper was scuttled in Kiel in May 1945, leaving Prinz Eugen as {{the only}} member of the class to survive the war. She was ceded to the US Navy, which {{ultimately}} expended <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in 1946. Seydlitz was towed to Königsberg and scuttled before the advancing Soviet Army could seize the ship. She was ultimately raised and broken up for scrap. Lützow, renamed Petropavlovsk, remained unfinished when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union. The ship provided artillery support against advancing German forces until she was sunk in September 1941. She was raised a year later and repaired enough to participate in the campaign to relieve the Siege of Leningrad in 1944. She served on in secondary roles until the 1950s, when she was broken up.|$|E
5|$|Amazone {{served with}} the Reichsmarine from 1923 to 1930. Korvettenkapitän Alfred Saalwächter took command of <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> 1926; he later {{went on to become}} a senior admiral during World War II. Amazone was {{stricken}} from the naval register on 31 March 1931. The ship was then used as a floating barracks for the Submarine Acceptance Commission in Kiel, and later as an auxiliary for the Warship Construction Test Office, submarine group. She survived World War II and after 1945, she was again used as a barracks ship in Bremen. The old cruiser was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1954 in Hamburg.|$|E

5|$|Armstrong studied whether {{replacing}} the 12-inch guns with seven 15-inch guns would be feasible, but Brazil was probably already attempting to sell <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> <b>In</b> the {{tension building up}} to the First World War, many countries, including Russia, Italy, Greece, and the Ottoman Empire, were interested in purchasing the ship. While Russia quickly dropped out, Italy and the rival Greeks and Ottomans were all highly interested. The Italians seemed close to purchasing the ship until the French government decided to back the Greeks—rather than allow the Italians, who were the principal naval rivals of the French, to obtain the ship. The Grecian government made an offer for the original purchase price plus an additional £50,000, but as the Greeks worked to obtain an initial installment, the Ottoman government was also making offers.|$|E
5|$|As Queen Mary 2 is {{too large}} to dock in many ports, {{passengers}} are ferried to and from <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> tenders, {{which can be used}} as lifeboats in an emergency. These are stored while at sea in davits alongside the lifeboats. To transport passengers to shore the tenders pull up to one of four loading stations, each of which has a large hull door that hydraulically opens outwards to form a boarding platform, complete with railings and decking.|$|E
5|$|Brazil ordered <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> 1911 as Rio de Janeiro {{from the}} British company Armstrong Whitworth. However, the {{collapse}} of Brazil's rubber boom and a warming in relations with Argentina, the country's chief rival, led to the ship's sale while under construction to the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans renamed her Sultan Osman I, after the empire's founder, and the ship was nearly complete when World War I broke out. The British government seized her {{for use by the}} Royal Navy, together with another Ottoman dreadnought being constructed in Britain. This act caused resentment in the Ottoman Empire, as the payments for both ships were complete, and contributed to the decision of the Ottoman government to join the Central Powers.|$|E

5|$|By early July 1907 Shackleton {{had secured}} little {{financial}} support beyond Beardmore's guarantee and was lacking {{the funds to}} complete the refit of <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> <b>In</b> mid-July he approached the philanthropic Earl of Iveagh, otherwise known as Edward Guinness, head of the Anglo-Irish brewing family, who agreed to guarantee the sum of £2,000 (updated value £) provided that Shackleton found other backers to contribute a further £6,000. Shackleton {{was able to do}} this, the extra funds including £2,000 from Sir Philip Brocklehurst, who paid this sum to secure a place on the expedition.|$|E
5|$|Construction on Graf Zeppelin {{began on}} 28 December 1936, when her keel was laid {{down at the}} Deutsche Werke {{shipyard}} in Kiel. Named in honor of Graf (Count) Ferdinand von Zeppelin, the ship was launched on 8 December 1938, and was 85% complete by the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. Graf Zeppelin was not completed and was never operational due to shifting construction priorities necessitated by the war. She remained in the Baltic {{for the duration of}} the war; with Germany's defeat imminent, the ship's custodian crew scuttled her just outside Stettin in March 1945. The Soviet Union raised <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> March 1946, and she was ultimately sunk in weapons tests north of Poland 17 months later. The wreck was discovered by a Polish survey ship in July 2006.|$|E
5|$|Deutschland {{remained}} on the East Asia station until early 1900, when she travelled via the Mediterranean and Portsmouth to Kiel. After returning to Germany, Deutschland {{was used as a}} harbor ship, starting on 3 May 1904. She was renamed Jupiter on 22 November of that year. On 21 May 1906, the ship was stricken from the naval register and used briefly as a target ship in 1907. The Kaiserliche Marine sold <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> 1908 for 120,000marks; she was broken up for scrap the following year in Hamburg-Moorburg.|$|E
