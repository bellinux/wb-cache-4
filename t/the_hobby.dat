In 1968 he stated that he lost $260,000 in an Algerian oil deal and was dealing with the Internal Revenue Service over unpaid taxes. In spite of his financial difficulties, Murphy refused to appear in commercials for alcohol and cigarettes, mindful of the influence he would have on the youth market.|$|E
5|$|Listeners often obtain QSL cards (which confirm contact) from ham operators, {{broadcasters}} or utility stations as trophies of <b>the</b> <b>hobby.</b> Traditionally, listeners {{would send}} {{letters to the}} station with reception reports and requests for schedules. Many stations now accept E-mails or provide reception report forms on their Web sites. Reception reports give valuable information about propagation and interference to a station's engineers.|$|E
5|$|Pet {{birds are}} kept in their millions, as are {{domestic}} fowls, bantams, and pigeons. These last had an important effect on evolutionary biology, as Charles Darwin took an especial interest in pigeon fancying, adopted <b>the</b> <b>hobby</b> himself, and made use of the wide variation between breeds as an argument for the power of selection in his 1859 Origin of Species.|$|E

5|$|The main predators of {{the house}} martins are those birds of prey which are capable of {{catching}} these agile fliers, such as <b>the</b> <b>hobby</b> (Falco subbuteo). Birds of the Delichon species are most vulnerable when collecting mud from the ground. This has therefore become a communal activity, {{with a group of}} these birds descending suddenly on a patch of mud. The generally insectivorous collared falconet has been recorded as hunting Nepal house martins.|$|E
5|$|Later {{commenting on}} this source, Maylam {{highlighted}} that its author {{did not appear}} to be from Kent and that, from their use of wording, it appeared that they had been told about the tradition by locals but had not actually witnessed it first hand. As such, Maylam suggested that the author may have been wrong in describing the use of a horse's skull in the Ramsgate tradition, given that both later sources and the hoodeners of his own time all used a wooden model of a horse's head. At the same time, Maylam noted that the use of a horse's skull was not impossible, for such skulls had also been used in <b>the</b> <b>hobby</b> horse traditions of other parts of Britain.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Minehead <b>hobby</b> horse custom {{was first}} {{recorded}} in 1830.The folklorist E. C.

5|$|One of Glynne's main {{interests}} was mountaineering {{and rock}} climbing, although {{her family did}} not support <b>the</b> <b>hobby,</b> as her mother's cousin, Owen Glynne Jones {{died at the age}} of 32 in a climbing accident on Dent Blanche. Despite this, Glynne climbed throughout her life, including in Australia and New Zealand whilst she was touring there. She recorded the second ever ascent of Mount Spencer in New Zealand, the first by a woman. When she returned to Europe, she climbed major Alpine peaks such as Matterhorn, Mont Blanc, La Meije and Aiguille du Dru in the 1930s. She carried on climbing into her 60s, ascending Mount Fuji in Japan in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Popular {{modes of}} {{operation}} include voice communication using amplitude modulation (AM), and Morse code using continuous wave (CW) radiotelegraphy. Among enthusiasts, there is considerable interest in owning, restoring and operating vintage military and commercial radio equipment, much of it more than 40 years old. Some undertake to construct their own gear, known in ham slang as homebrewing, using vintage parts and designs. A number of amateur radio clubs and organizations sponsor contests, events, and swap meets that cater to this specialized aspect of <b>the</b> <b>hobby.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shortwave {{listening}}, or SWLing, is <b>the</b> <b>hobby</b> {{of listening}} to shortwave radio broadcasts located on frequencies between 1700 kHz and 30 MHz. Listeners range from casual users seeking international news and entertainment programming, to hobbyists immersed in {{the technical aspects of}} radio reception and collecting official confirmations (QSL cards) that document their reception of distant broadcasts (DXing). In some developing countries, shortwave listening enables remote communities to obtain regional programming traditionally provided by local medium wave AM broadcasters. In 2002, the number of households that were capable of shortwave listening was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a variety}} of schools and religious, {{cultural}} and sporting facilities including sailing and wind surfing and golf. One popular ancient local tradition involves <b>the</b> <b>Hobby</b> Horse, or Obby Oss, which takes to the streets for four days {{on the eve of the}} first of May each year, with accompanying musicians and rival horses. The town is the starting point of the South West Coast Path National Trail, the nation's longest long-distance countryside walking trail. The Minehead Railway was opened in 1874 and closed in 1971 but has since been reopened as the West Somerset Railway.|$|E
5|$|Lie and {{his family}} {{returned}} to Buitenzorg in 1866. At the time there were no schools offering a European-style education in the city, and thus {{he was sent to}} a Chinese-run school. For three years, in which the youth studied under three different headmasters, he was made to repeat traditional Hokkien phrases and copy Chinese characters without understanding them. Tio suggests that Lie obtained little knowledge at the school, and until his death Lie was unable to understand Chinese. During his time in Buitenzorg, he studied painting under Raden Saleh, a friend of his father's. Although he reportedly showed skill, he did not continue <b>the</b> <b>hobby</b> as his mother disapproved. He also showed a propensity for traditional literary forms such as pantun (a form of poetry) and was fond of creating his own.|$|E
5|$|Modern fantasy sports {{began in}} 1980 with the {{invention}} of Rotisserie League Baseball by New York writer Daniel Okrent and several friends. Participants in a Rotisserie league draft notional teams {{from the list of}} active Major League Baseball players and play out an entire imaginary season with game outcomes based on the players' latest real-world statistics. Rotisserie-style play quickly became a phenomenon. Now known more generically as fantasy baseball, it has inspired similar games based on an array of different sports. The field boomed with increasing Internet access and new fantasy sports–related websites. By 2008, 29.9 million people in the United States and Canada were playing fantasy sports, spending $800million on <b>the</b> <b>hobby.</b> The burgeoning popularity of fantasy baseball is also credited with the increasing attention paid to sabermetrics—first among fans, only later among baseball professionals.|$|E

5|$|Celeste gives Natasha the waitressing job at Charlie's and {{she moves}} in with Summer and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), after her house is sold. Natasha also decides {{to drop out}} of her {{university}} course, upon realising that it is not right for her. Natasha meets Ed Lee (Sebastian Gregory) at Charlie's and offers to help him solve a maths equation, but he dismisses her. When she solves the problem, he invites her to a maths club. Natasha later transfers to his calculus course and Ed helps her with conditional probability, which they use to predict the outcome of a game of cards. They decide to play a game of Blackjack with a group of guys at Charlie's, but are forced to stop when a couple of police officers walks in. Natasha convinces Ed to hold a game at the Men's Shed, so they can continue to test the theory and make some money.
