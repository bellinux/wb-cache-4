In the United States the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sponsored a study of the problem which was initiated in 1982 and reported in 1986. It focused on the frequency of breathing system disconnections, the resulting in-cidence of mortality and morbidity, the causes of the disconnections and their locations within the breath-ing systems, and the clinical intervention strategies {{at the time of the}} study [13]. The conclusions from this study were: • Disconnections are common events in critical care and anaesthesia (indeed disconnections occur so often as to be considered as routine, and para-doxically the degree of clinical concern about disconnection is relatively low because disconnec-tions are usually detected and corrected). Discon-nections seem to be grudgingly accepted as necessary in view of the need for easy access to the airway. However, accidental disconnections rep-resent an important underlying reason for the few injuries which do occur. • A substantial number of preventable serious injuries and deaths result from disconnection. • Disconnection is a problem which consumes energy and diverts attention from other aspects of patient care. The clinician's job could be made considerably easier if steps could be taken to lessen the frequency of this event. • Disconnections occur most frequently at the site of connection of the tracheal tube to the breathing system. • Disconnection results from many factors, some evident and some more subtle. • There has been a concerted effort on the part of manufacturers and the various standards organ-izations to solve this complex problem...|$|E

40|$|A {{hydronic}} radiant {{system is}} a type of the space thermal environment control system using a heated or cooled surface of building components such as floor, wall, and ceiling. The systems have been reported to have advantages in improving occupants??? thermal comfort and reducing heating and cooling energy consumption. Although the system has advantages for the thermal comfort of occupants and energy saving potential, it also has drawbacks to be overcome. The most important disadvantages of the conventional radiant system are {{that it is hard to}} control the ventilation requirements and the system capacity for cooling operation decreases due to surface condensation in most humid climate conditions. Several incorporation models, which combine the hydronic radiant system and the forced all-air system, have been implemented into actual buildings and have been used to evaluate the system performance. However, there are no attempts to develop a new radiant system that controls the fresh air for the space without additional components such as heating and cooling coils. This study developed a new radiant system having a concentric tube heat exchanger in a radiant panel and evaluated the system characteristics. The concentric tube heat exchanger allows two fluids, air and water, to flow in the same direction. The outdoor air for the space ventilation requirement passes through an inner tube of the heat exchanger and exchanges heat with an outer water tube of the heat exchanger. The primary heat transfer medium, water, flows through the outer tube exchanging heat with the radiant panel and the air tube. At the outlets of the heat exchanger, both fluids have an identical temperature. The air is delivered into the space directly and the water returns into the plant side. The system configuration enables simultaneous satisfaction of the space thermal loads and ventilation loads without additional components for conditioning the outdoor air. Moreover, the outdoor air can circulate through the air tube during the nighttime in the summer season to damp the heat sink source for daytime cooling loads. The flexibility of using the heat transfer medium, air or water, is recognized in the naming of the hybrid heat source radiant (HHSR) system. This conceptual idea has been evaluated by a numerical analysis model based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Comparing with the result of a typical hydronic radiant system and a hydronic radiant system incorporated with a convective forced-air system under steady state analysis with the same conditions, the proposed system can also provide an acceptable local thermal environment in terms of the vertical temperature difference, the floor surface temperature, and the percentage of discomfort due to draft. A transient energy simulation model of the proposed {{system is a}}lso developed for a whole building energy simulation program, EnergyPlus. Three different analysis models have been studied for the transient model to investigate the heat transfer characteristics of the concentric tube heat exchanger with a non-adiabatic outer shell condition. A modified effectiveness and number of transfer unit (??-NTU) method, which considered the heat capacity properties of the radiant panel and the heat mediums, is selected and the semi-numerical analysis model is interpreted as a program module for the whole building energy and indoor thermal environment simulation program. The water outlet temperature and space mean air temperature of both models of the CFD and EnergyPlus are in agreement with each other in the acceptable tolerance under the given conditions. Finally, the case study is conducted to investigate the system capability and characteristics under 16 different climate conditions in the United States for two different building types, a medium size office and residential units. The building types and climate conditions are based on the presentation of the Department of Energy in the U. S. for the standardized energy simulation models for commercial and residential buildings and the representative locations for 16 different climates. The hourly heating and cooling energy consumption and thermal environment condition for each building type in the 16 climate zones are predicted for three different radiant systems: a typical hydronic radiant system, an outdoor air control system incorporated with the typical radiant system, and the HHSR system. From the annual energy consumption simulation, it was shown that the system performance of the HHSR system allows the system to be considered as a viable HVAC system compared with the conventional radiant system types for the office building type. The HHSR system provides acceptable indoor thermal comfort indices in terms of Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and has energy saving potential for heating and cooling operating in the most locations. The configuration of the proposed system also effectively prevents system interruption due to surface condensation during cooling periods in humid climates. In addition, the system expected an additional day time cooling energy saving, when passive cooling using outdoor air ventilation is applied in the night time. Comparing the case of residential units, the results are different from those of the office building case. Although the HHSR system can provide similar indoor thermal conditions to other conventional radiant systems, the heating and cooling energy saving potential depends on the climate condition. By the internal heat gain condition of the residential units, the proposed system does not expect as substantial energy saving benefits as the office building in a particular climate condition. This study also found that some limitations should be considered when the proposed system is implemented and operated in buildings. For the HHSR system, the ventilation air temperature depends on the water outlet temperature, so the water flow rate control scheme impacts the air temperature. Therefore the overall system performance might be changed by the water flow rate logic. Another important consideration is water condensation in the air tube. Although the proposed system can prevent surface condensation on the radiant panel, the water condensation is predicted in the air tube in most humid locations. Internal condensation should be carefully controlled for to assure the hygiene of ventilation air. Future works that should be done based on this study include the experimental validation of the proposed system, the development of a practical <b>tube</b> <b>connection</b> and split methods between the fluids (air and water) supply/delivery side and the concentric tube heat exchanger, and a lifecycle assessment (LCA) of the HHSR system from the manufacturing stage to the demolition stage...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is the design and the {{realization}} of a 30 kV reference voltage divider (VD) for smart grid monitoring, which will be mainly used in laboratories to characterize and calibrate the voltage transducers. The scale factor ratio error introduced by a normal voltage transducer (VT), according to technical report IEC/TR 61869 - 103 must be limited {{to a maximum of}} 1 % up to 2 nd harmonics and to a maximum of 5 % up to the 50 th harmonics. The maximum acceptable phase error should be no more than 18 mrad up to the 2 nd harmonics and 90 mrad up to the 50 th harmonics. Of course, the target for a reference voltage transducer should be much more accurate than the requirement of the standards for a normal VT. A reference voltage transducer is expected to show high accuracy also at higher frequencies, since this feature is needed in smart grids, due to the considerable amount of harmonics after the 50 th harmonics even up to 10 kHz, although this peculiarity is not required by the standards for transducers in normal electrical networks. Then, in the bandwidth up to 10 kHz, the maximum target deviation from the rated scale factor for the reference VD has been selected equal to 0. 05 % and the maximum phase error equal to 9 mrad. To reach such a high accuracy, {{there is a need for}} a design tool, which can model and simulate the divider with a very good accuracy. Then, this tool could be used for the design procedure of the structure and of the definition of the geometrical parameters of the reference VD, in order to realize an extremely accurate measurement device satisfying the demanding constraints mentioned above. To begin with, two methods, the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Boundary Element Method (BEM), were examined in calculating the stray capacitance between two (physically infinite) planes. The comparison of BEM and FEM results with the analytical ones shows a better accuracy and a lower CPU simulation time in FEM rather than in BEM approach. Thus, the physical model of the reference VD has been simulated by FEM. The output of the FEM software is a matrix defining the stray capacitance network between different nodes (equipotential surfaces) of a voltage divider. This matrix is used as an input of a MATLAB program, which solves the electrical circuit of the VD. Furthermore, a small voltage divider was realized to prove the capability of this modeling approach. The measurement results of the test VD shows a good agreement with the results obtained from the theoretical method. An innovative approach was presented in the modeling of resistors, which have been divided into two parts, instead of being modeled as a single component. The important role of the resistor body modeling in calculating the stray capacitances in the VD has been highlighted. The validation procedure was repeated for a real 20 kV VD that was already available. The comparison between measurement and theoretical results confirms the validity and high accuracy of the proposed modelling approach. The research carried out up to here has been published in "IEEE Transaction on power delivery". The realization of the numerical tool has allowed the design of the reference 30 kV VD. The first issue was to find the best configuration for the VD. It is not clear in literature what kind of configuration could be the best or what should be considered in the design and realization course. Such a lack of guidelines is the main reason that impeded the application of an optimization method in this project. In fact, the optimization process could be used for a device, which has a known and fixed configuration with a limited number of geometrical and electrical variables that can be selected in order to find the best value for the best objective function. The design realized in this project aimed also at configuring shape and structure of the divider for future optimization process. In other words, some different VD configurations and effect of different parameters variation have been deeply investigated. At the start of assessment, different kind of stray capacitances and their effect on the frequency behavior of a VD have been discussed. This subject has been investigated by introducing the equivalent circuit of a simple VD. Then the effect of modifying different kind of stray capacitances on the VD frequency behavior has been shown. Besides, the best condition for the stray capacitances that can lead to a good frequency behavior has been discussed. The initial VD design procedure was done in order to mainly understand the effect of geometrical parameters like the distances between the HV resistors and between HV and LV sections. The goal was to lower (and also balance) the stray capacitances. Then, a grounded plate has been introduced and discussed in the resistive VD with horizontally placed resistors, in the attempt of reducing and better balancing the stray capacitances. The effect of the presence and also the size of the plate has been discussed and the effect of the distances between the resistors were also studied (Section 3. 3). At this stage, new circuital components have been introduced in the divider. The compensation of the low voltage (LV) side with an extra LV capacitor (CBT) is explained (this subject is explained in detail in section 3. 3. 7). As the next step, a Reference Voltage Divider (RVD) considering the voltage requirements (30 kV) and high voltage (HV) resistors (with rated voltage of 10 kV) has been designed. The first design has been dedicated to the simplest configuration with vertically placed HV resistors. Then the geometrical parameters (distances) has been changed and the effect was studied. At the end of this part, a VD configuration with vertically placed HV resistors has been modelled and simulated. The simulation has been carried out with an accurate model including all the details of the components available for the VD realization like, for instance, insulation supports, resistors and pillars. Design simulations show very good results that comply the uncertainty limitations of a reference VD. However, there was a drawback in that first design configuration. Its size was quite large compared to the similar measurement devices in this voltage range. Despite this fact, the finalized RVD was realized and its frequency behavior was measured using two digitizers at the low voltage side. Although the measurement results were following the frequency behavior of the simulation results, a significant discrepancy between the measured and simulated frequency responses has been found. Section 3. 6. 1 show the analysis of the discrepancies between the model and measurements. The reason was due to the ground below the VD that was disregarded in the simulations. The agreement between computed and measured response of the VD with vertically placed resistors significantly improves when the ground is correctly modeled. However, the ground presence worsens the frequency behavior of the VD, which becomes undesirable for a RVD, even if acceptable with respect to the requirement of the standards for a normal voltage transducer. The analysis of the VD with vertically placed HV resistors has been published in the journal of "International review on electrical engineering". In a next step, the general behavior of the 30 kV VD with horizontally placed HV resistors has been investigated since this configuration results to be more compact and should be less sensitive to proximity objects. In the previous configuration (the vertical one), the distances between high voltage nodes were large enough that small changes in the resistor placement or in the shield dimensions do not modify significantly the electric field. However, in this new configuration (the horizontal one), the electric field must be calculated by FEM for any modification of the parameters. Two different way of connections between HV resistors were modeled (section 3. 7) with long and short connections. The comparison between the two configurations shows that the VD with shorter copper <b>tube</b> <b>connection</b> have a better behavior and so has been further investigated in the following. The RVD with horizontally placed resistors could give a good frequency behavior. However, the maximum electrical field strength could not be further lowered due to the nature of this configuration (section 3. 7). In order to get an improved frequency behavior a zig-zag configuration has been introduced a topological variation of the horizontal configuration. The zig-zag VD lowers the maximum electrical field strength compared to the horizontal resistor VD (section 3. 8). More than 50 cases of zig-zag VD with different parameters were simulated to reach the goal of the project design. A main part of the focus was on the shielding of the RVD in a way to control and manipulate the stray capacitances in order to make the VD error compliant with the design specification. The main drawback of this zig-zag RVD is the sensitivity towards the proximity effect. In section 3. 8. 8, a shielding with three different screen parts has been proposed. Such a shield could give a good frequency behavior with small proximity sensitivity. However, the model with three screens could not be realized at the moment as it requires special workshop tools, not available at the moment. A different approach has been achieved providing a reduction of the proximity effect (section 3. 10). The zig-zag RVD has been fitted with an LV shield. The measurement results show an accuracy of ± 980 ppm for the scale factor, up to 50 kHz, and less than 9 mrad for the phase error up to 32 kHz (2. 1 mrad up to 10 kHz). This zig-zag RVD could be used in any laboratory environment after calibration for the specified perimeter. To further reduce the proximity sensitivity, HV capacitors have been added to the zig-zag RVD, which significantly reduces the effect of the stray parameters and the VD is much less affected by the proximity changes (stray capacitance changes). The result of zig-zag RCVD with LV connected shield shows a promising frequency behavior which could be considered as a reference voltage transducer. By connecting the LV shield to the ground one can obtain a further reduction of the proximity effect (section 3. 10. 3). The zig-zag reference RCVD with ground connected shield shows a maximum 244 ppm of scale factor uncertainty and less than 345 µrad of the phase error uncertainty from DC up to 10 kHz. The proximity effect investigation done in Sect 3. 10. 3 has highlighted that this divider (with ground-connected shield) exhibits very small proximity sensitivity. For example, if a grounded (or floating) object having size similar to the one of the divider approaches the VD up to 30 cm, the scale factor changes less than 91 ppm and the phase error is modified about 82 µrad...|$|E

The results of the ultimate load capacity demonstrated the viability of the <b>tube</b> sleeve <b>connection</b> use...|$|R
5|$|The GWR {{objected to}} the {{reduction}} of the Bakerloo <b>Tube's</b> Paddington <b>connection</b> to a shuttle and the MR {{objected to the}} connection of the two lines, which would be in competition with its line through Kilburn. Parliament rejected the proposed connection and the changes to the NWLR's route and the company's permissions eventually expired without any construction work being carried out. The Bakerloo Tube bill was withdrawn.|$|R
40|$|Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) is a {{versatile}} tool in lab-on-chip systems since it controls fluid shape and flow by electrical signals alone without using external pumps and related <b>tube</b> <b>connections.</b> The most versatile EWOD configuration (allowing transport, division and mixing of droplets) is the closed one, where the fluid handling occurs between two coupled glasses. However, {{the use of}} EWOD-based lab-on-chip is often laborious due to the necessity of spacers between the bottom and top glasses {{as well as of}} oil to confine the solution droplets and to avoid fluid evaporation. In order to overcome these issues, we have developed a new technology called In-Channel EWOD (ICEWOD) relying on the microelectronic definition of the microfluidic channel in the top glass and on the microelectronic fabrication of the EWOD electrodes in the bottom glass. Experiments, performed injecting a saline solution in the reservoir (see Figure 2 c), demonstrated both the successful dispensing of separate droplets from the reservoir and their subsequent movement along the electrodes to fill the central chamber. Furthermore, the system showed robustness against mechanical stress as well as high reliability after several tests...|$|R
40|$|The {{multiaxial fatigue}} {{behaviour}} of materials with different ductility under constant and changing principal stress directions is also applicable to welded joints of different materials. For this, welded flange <b>tube</b> <b>connections</b> {{of the fine}} grained steel StE 460 and the artificially aged aluminium alloy AlSilMgMn T 6 were investigated under constant amplitude combined bending and torsion. Out-of-phase loading, i. e. changing principal stress directions, of the steel joints led to a decrease of fatigue life, which is observed at ductile material states. However, for the aluminium joints out-of-phase loading resulted same behaviour as in-phase loading, which indicates a semi-ductile material behaviour. The results for the welded steel joints were evaluated on basis of local stresses by the integral hypothesis of the Effective Equivalent Stress EES (WVS). This hypothesis for ductile material states {{takes into account the}} life decreasing influence of out-of-phase loading by considering the interaction of the shear stresses on different planes. The fatigue behaviour of the aluminium welds is described by the critical plane based combination of shear and normal stresses (KoNoS), which is valid for semi-ductile material states...|$|R
