30|$|This data is {{segmented}} {{by means}} of seaborne transport (import and export) and interactions between the following geographic activity areas: Middle East, Europe, America, Asia (Far East), Asia ISC (Indian sub-continent), Asia Arab and Africa, according to the policy segmentation of Lloyd’s Marine Intelligence Unit (LMIU). This allows us to receive annual data such as: total borne ton in each area (Mt), a segmentation of the total <b>ton</b> <b>transported</b> {{by means of}} sea freight transportation in each area (Mt) and interactions between areas by the borne ton (Mt) along with segmentation by means of sea freight transportation (Mt). Due {{to the fact that}} the nominal data for borne ton at this moment is not relevant, we will continue to process the data by percentage. Using the total seaborne tons in a given year will serve as a reference for an annual allocation. We will perform the segmentation of the seaborne tons by means of sea freight transportation (%), interactions between areas (%) by sea borne tons. The results of this action will grant us ten tables (one for each year - 1997 – 2007) of sea borne ton relations (%), segments by area (%), means of sea freight transportation (%) and interactions between areas (%).|$|E
40|$|AbstractRail freight {{transport}} is today characterized by inefficiencies {{in the use}} of the existing infrastructure while the growing demand is activated by giant containers vessels handling thousands of units in the ports. Lack of industrialization prevents gaining from economies of scale while bottlenecks penalize the optimization of the network use. The rail {{freight transport}} market share remains low whereas for environmental reasons immediate progress is required. Capacity 4 Rail intends to analyze the key factors enabling rail freight market share to increase on the most promising segments. The innovations planned by Capacity 4 Rail are concentrated on three macro-areas from the concept to simulations and tests: wagon structure design, wagon equipment technology and train maneuverability. For the wagon structure, the project focuses on the new design giving direct efficiency: better payload, less deadweight, extended usable length, maintenance cost reduction. With a reduced weight due to the use of new materials the design evolution allows to make the best use of the gauge profile. For the wagon equipment technology a continuous electric line carrying a bus of information all along the train and bringing energy to the wagon allows placing various sensors increasing safety and reliability. With this new wagon connectivity, predictive maintenance is developed but also accurate real time information are available for the customers enhancing the planning efficiency of the next supply chain evolution. The wagons are equipped with an electric command of the pneumatic brakes for an instant and simultaneous braking and releasing. The brakes of all wagons reduces drastically the longitudinal forces in the couplings enabling progressive lengthening of the train reducing operational costs and network capacity consumption per <b>ton</b> <b>transported.</b> For the train, this new braking system improves its maneuverability, giving access to better paths aiming to reduce the wear of the wheels created by the new brake composite shoes imposed for noise reduction. All these potential progress are researched and checked in terms of affordability taking into account not only the global added value created but an equitable reward of all the stakeholders having invested for such innovations. Proposed roadmaps incorporate viable business models for a progressive implementation on the basis of simulations. A virtuous circle is initiated improving the use of assets, reducing noise, informing customers more efficiently, reducing maintenance and operational costs in an affordable way...|$|E

50|$|After transiting Balabac Strait on 22 September, Bonefish {{continued}} {{on to her}} patrol area in {{the central part of}} the South China Sea. Three days later, the submarine attacked a convoy of eight ships, scoring three hits on a freighter before the escorts forced her to go deep to avoid a depth charge attack. Bonefish encountered another convoy on 27 September and launched four torpedoes at the lead ship, the largest of the five, and sank the 9,908 <b>ton</b> <b>transport</b> Kashima Maru and damaged the Chihaya Maru. The escort ships pursued Bonefish, but she was able to dive and elude her attackers. On 6 October, the boat approached a third convoy and scored hits on two heavily laden cargo vessels. Again forced to go deep to avoid the counterattack, she failed to evaluate the damage that her torpedoes had done to the targets. On 10 October, in her last action of the patrol, Bonefish fired a spread of four torpedoes at two ships of a convoy off Indochina, sending both the 4,212 ton cargo ship Isuzugawa and the 10,086 <b>ton</b> <b>transport</b> Teibi Maru to the bottom. On 14 October the Bonefish sank a Japanese sailing vessel in the Makassar Strait. Bonefish concluded her first war patrol back at Fremantle, Western Australia on 21 October.|$|R
