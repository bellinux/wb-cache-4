500|$|Erica Hahn was {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} minor character, and occasional guest-star rival of Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). The character first appeared in three episodes of the show's second season, followed by another two episodes of the show's third season. Discussing whether she thought Hahn might become a main character after her season three appearance, Smith has stated that at the time: [...] "I didn't really <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to work out", joking that [...] "After every time I would hope that they would call and also hope not too– kind of like when I used to be single." [...] However, following Washington's departure from the show, Hahn was brought back as a main character in the show's fourth season, replacing Burke as Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Smith has {{said that she was}} not expecting her character to be introduced to the show full-time, as she [...] "didn't want to be disappointed if it didn't happen." [...] She has stated that a deciding factor in her return was the opportunity it presented to explore the character in greater depth, explaining: [...] "When I work on something that has a beginning, middle and end, I can create an arc. With Dr. Hahn, I need to figure out who she is". Researching the role, Smith watched a heart surgery performed, and liaised with the surgical nurses employed by Grey's Anatomy producers to maintain realism in the show's operating room. She dubbed this research stressful, stating that [...] "I got very neurotic about the fact that I didn’t go to medical school. I’m not actually a doctor", explaining; [...] "I {{have no idea what it}} really is to be a surgeon and yet I have to act like I am really good at it. I have to look like I’ve been doing it a long time".|$|E

2500|$|On February 5, 1985, twin {{brothers}} Bill and Bob Clark sighted a 60+ {{foot long}} sea serpent in San Francisco Bay that crashed onto a submerged rocky ledge only 20 {{yards away from}} where {{they were sitting in}} their car. It was around 7:45 a.m. and the water was calm. The Clark brothers were sitting in their car drinking coffee when they noticed a group of seals in the water. Then they noticed what they thought was another seal approach the group. The group of seals began to swim away and one of them headed for the seawall where the Clarks were parked. The seals were followed by the creature and according to Bob, [...] "Bill started saying it was moving strange. He said it was not a seal, it's a snake." [...] Bob continued, [...] "We watched it coming in, undulating in a vertical manner. Where most snakes undulate side to side, this was up and down, creating humps in the water. Bob said, [...] "The seals were leaping through the water in front of it. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to eat them. It was behind the seals arched above the water line and I could tell it was a large animal when the arch appeared to stay in one spot. I could see the body moving through the arch." [...] The Clarks said the water was so clear that morning they could easily see the creature as it undulated at amazing speed like an uncoiling whip. [...] They both estimated the length of the creature to be at least 60 feet. As it swam over the submerged rocky ledge it stopped dead in its tracks then it appeared to slide a few feet across the water creating a light spray. It apparently got stuck on the rocks. Bob said the animal turned clockwise and exposed its midsection. [...] "It turned over like a corkscrew in midsection. We could see the belly of the animal. It reminded me of an alligator stomach, creamy white, soft leathery looking, but with a tint of yellow in it." [...] He continued saying, [...] "After it twisted over and showed the underbelly, another section behind the underbelly came up about three feet out of the water. I got an excellent view of a fin-type appendage, which opened up like an accordion fan. It stayed up about five seconds, long enough for me to tell my brother, 'Bill, I'm going to look at it as long as I can so I can remember it.' [...] " [...] After it twisted the midsection off of the submerged rocky ledge, Bill said they watched the creature sit [...] "motionless in the water for five or ten seconds". Then it began to swim away, using a [...] "violent, downward thrust of its upper neck which sent a pack of coils backwards towards the midsection. After a few seconds of undulations, the creature moved rapidly, just {{below the surface of the}} water northward toward deeper water in the middle of the Bay." [...] Bill concluded his account by saying, [...] "I don't care if anyone believes me. I know what I saw. It was too mind-blowing and close to me not to say something about it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, yes, I don't {{know but}} I am. I didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to look just that way. Mr. Congdon says blue shadows are under anybody's ears in the light, but I can't see 'em on the Captain, and I do see 'em in the picture; that's what gets me twisted. When I {{look at the}} picture I can't see nothin' else." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, it corroborates {{the young}} man's {{story to the}} extent that the will was drawn up by Jonas Oldacre in his journey yesterday. It is curious--is it not?--that a man should draw up so {{important}} a document in so haphazard a fashion. It suggests that he did not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be of much practical importance. If a man drew up a will which he did not intend ever to be effective, he might do it so." ...|$|E
60|$|Rollo's {{father and}} mother and his uncle looked at the clouds all around. They {{concluded}} that there was every appearance of rain, {{and that it would be}} best to postpone their excursion, and then went into the house. Rollo was very confident it would not rain, and was very eager to have them go. He asked Lucy if she did not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be pleasant, but Lucy was more modest and reasonable than he was, and said that she did not know; she could not judge of the weather so well as her father.|$|E
5000|$|Yes, I did <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be great, all {{the work}} was so good, every actor was inspired, and Altman's team was {{intensely}} competent, and he was that rare kind of genius who knows {{what works and what}} doesn't at the moment it is happening.|$|E

"I think [...] "Sweater Weather" [...] might've {{been the}} best song we'd ever written," [...] Rutherford added, [...] "but I didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to be the best}} song we'd ever write.

5000|$|We didn’t {{think when}} we were {{starting}} this {{out that it was}} going to be the first - we didn’t even <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be on TV, we weren’t even sure about mobile, but that’s the way it’s all come out."

6000|$|... "The smoke <b>is</b> not <b>going</b> either way," [...] said Rollo.

2500|$|In January 2005, McCain {{said that}} [...] "one of our big {{problems}} {{has been the}} fact that many Iraqis resent American military presence. ... {{as soon as we can}} reduce our visibility as much as possible, the better I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bridget LaMonica from Den of Geek, gave {{a perfect}} 5 star rating out of 5, stating: [...] "The episode {{was loaded with}} hilarious one liners and quips from many characters, but Chuck stole the show in the first half. He even claimed he was writing a new series, titled Revolution, but didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> anywhere. Funny nod to the show by Supernatural creator Eric Kripke that was {{canceled}} in 2014. I never thought Supernatural would dare bring God to the show, but now I'm glad they have. [...] " ...|$|E

I didn’t <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be quite good enough. I pushed as hard as I could. Sometimes you overdrive it a little bit and you can still make some speed.

5000|$|I didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be simple, and it's {{going to}} take perhaps a generation, two generations really to turn the tide I think, but I do {{believe it will be}} turned. It's not just us, there are many people now taking up this work, and as the burden, the stress which is largely because of {{increasing}} population - in the last 50 years the population of India has tripled, probably the population of Vrindavan has multiplied by more than that - so that creates huge pressures, and it's {{going to take}} a long time to change those, but as the pressure increases so does the urgency to find a solution.|$|E

Hay, confessed that he started those rumors during a difficult time. [...] "The PR stunt that I did was out of desperation to help break 'Pon de Replay,'" [...] Hay said.

5000|$|Questions {{were later}} {{raised about the}} {{validity}} of the procedure.

Muller later stated in an interview on Countdown with Keith Olbermann, [...] "I admit it, it was a stupid radio stunt. But waterboarding, all it is, is water in your nose and mouth with your head back." [...] Further adding [...] "We went into this thinking {{it was going to be}} a joke.
