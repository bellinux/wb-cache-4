25|$|On November 11, 2013, Stamkos {{suffered}} a broken tibia {{in a game}} against the Boston Bruins. He was backchecking on a play late in the second period when he was tied up with Boston defenceman Dougie Hamilton. His left skate appeared to hit the post first before his right leg crashed into it around the shin area. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> twice before going down to the ice in pain, grabbing his leg just above the ankle. After a brief delay, a stretcher was brought out and he was taken off to loud applause. He was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital. Stamkos entered the day tied for the NHL's lead in scoring with Pittsburgh's Sidney Crosby.|$|E
25|$|Another version tells {{that two}} Sioux boys wandered {{far from their}} village when Mato the bear, a huge {{creature}} that had claws the size of tipi poles, spotted them, and wanted to eat them for breakfast. He was almost upon them when the boys prayed to Wakan Tanka the Creator to help them. They rose up on a huge rock, while Mato <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> from every side, leaving huge scratch marks as he did. Finally, he sauntered off, disappointed and discouraged. The bear came to rest east of the Black Hills at what is now Bear Butte. Wanblee, the eagle, helped the boys off the rock and back to their village. A painting depicting this legend by artist Herbert A. Collins hangs over the fireplace in the visitor's center at Devils Tower.|$|E
25|$|Tabari writes, “God created Adam {{with his}} own hands so that God could say to Iblis (Satan) that he was exalting himself over that which God formed {{with his own}} hands. So God created Adam as a human and his body was from clay. God breathed his spirit into Adam. Then when God’s spirit entered his eyes he saw the fruits of Paradise and when it entered his stomach he was hungry, so before the spirit reached his feet he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> in haste to have the fruits of Paradise. This {{is the meaning of}} God’s word: “Man was created in haste” (21:37) In regards to the testing of Adam and Eve, Ibn Ishaq writes, “Iblis started off by crying for Adam and Eve, and they became sad when they heard him. They asked him why he was crying and he said, “I am crying for you because you will die and be forced to give up the luxury and plenty you are enjoying.” Then Iblis went to them and whispered saying, “Adam, may I lead you to the Tree of Immortality and to a kingdom that does not decline?” (20:120) Meaning that they might become angels or live forever in Paradise. In the Qur'an it states, “When we took from the prophets their {{covenant}} from you, Noah, Abraham, and Jesus son of Mary. We took from them a solemn covenant” (Q 33:7) That covenant was, as quoted by Ibn Abbas “The Prophet Muhammad said, “God took a covenant from the back of Adam on the day of ‘Arafat. He caused all of his offspring to come out of him, and spread them out in front of him. In regards to Adam’s death, Tabari writes, “When Adam died it was Friday. The angels came to him, sent by God from Paradise, to embalm and wrap him, and they honored his son and heir Seth. Ibn Ishaq says: The sun and the moon were eclipsed for seven days and nights.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rivalry between}} Chris Jericho and John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield started in Jericho's WWE Championship match against the {{defending}} champion, Randy Orton, at Armageddon. During the match, Orton whipped Jericho over the SmackDown! announce table straight into JBL. As Jericho <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up,</b> {{he ended up}} [...] "nudging" [...] JBL out of his way. Later in the match, Jericho had Orton trapped in the Walls of Jericho, when, JBL stormed into the ring and gave a kick to Jericho's face, thus giving the win to Jericho, but via disqualification, and hence, Jericho did not win the WWE Championship. This led to an argument the next night on Raw, where Jericho, who was angry about not becoming the new WWE Champion, ended up stating to JBL, who confronted Y2J via satellite from the Raw TitanTron, that [...] "John, {{you are no longer}} a wrestling god, you're a wrestling afterthought". Afterward, JBL gave his farewell address as SmackDown color commentator on the December 21, 2007 airing of Friday Night SmackDown and announced his return as an active wrestler on Raw. When JBL made his return to Raw on December 31, entering in his personal limousine with balloons and confetti shooting from the ceiling, and proceeded to address the crowd, Jericho quickly interrupted his promo and the two got engaged in a brawl along the barricade. The following week, Jericho was put into a handicap match against Snitsky and JBL. The match started with Snitsky and Jericho in the ring, but, soon after Jericho hit a Springboard dropkick on Snitsky, JBL came into the ring and attacked Jericho from behind. JBL get the better of this confrontation as he hit Jericho on the head with the ring bell and tied a cable wire around his neck. JBL then dragged Jericho, by the wire, from near the ring to the Raw set, where he assaulted him some more. Jericho suffered from a bruised larynx, burns around his neck, and had difficulty speaking for a week.|$|E
2500|$|Cook's {{men and the}} British Marines {{were confronted}} on the beach by an elderly kahuna who {{approached}} them holding a coconut and chanting. They yelled at the priest to go away but he kept approaching them while singing the mele. When Cook and his men looked away from the old kahuna, they saw that the beach was now filled with thousands of Native Hawaiians. Cook yelled at Kalaniʻōpuʻu to get up but the ruler refused. As the townspeople began to gather around them, Cook and his men began {{to back away from}} the crowd and raise their guns. The two chiefs and Kānekapōlei shielded the aliʻi nui as Cook tried to force him to his feet. Kanaʻina approached Cook, who reacted by striking the chief with the broad side of his sword. Kanaʻina instantly grabbed Cook and lifted the man. Some accounts state that Kanaʻina did not intend to hit Cook while other descriptions say the chief struck the navigator across the head with his leiomano. Either way, Kanaʻina released Cook, who fell to the sand. As Cook <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up,</b> the attendant, Nuaa fatally stabbed him with a metal dagger, ironically traded from Cook's ship during the same visit. According to John Ledyard, Cook fired the first shot in the skirmish and therefore was responsible for the circumstances that led to his death. [...] Ledyard describes the escalation in his journal: [...] "Cook attended to what this man said, and desired him to show him the Indian that had dared to attempt combat with him, {{and as soon as he}} was pointed out, Cook fired at him with a blank. The indian perceiving he received no damage from the fire rushed from without the crowd a second time, and threatened anyone who should oppose him. Cook perceiving this fired a ball, which entering the Indian's groin he fell and was drawn off by the rest. Cook perceiving the people determined to oppose his designs, and that he should not succeed without further bloodshed ordered the lieutenant of marines (Mr. Phillips) to withdraw his men and get them into the boats.....the instant they began to retreat, Cook was hit with a stone and perceiving the man who hove, shot him dead: the officers in the boats perceiving the guard retreating and hearing this third discharge ordered [...] the boats to fire.....Cook having at length reached the margin of the water between the fire of the boats waved with his hat to cease firing and come in, and while he was doing this a chief from behind stabbed him with one of our iron daggers just under the shoulder blade, and passed quite through the body. Cook fell with his face in the water and immediately expired." [...] This caused a close quarters melee between the townspeople and Cook's companions. Four of the Royal Marines (Corporal James Thomas and Privates Theophilus Hinks, Thomas Fachett, and John Allen) were killed, and two were wounded. The remaining sailors and marines fired as they fled to their small boat and rowed back to their ship, injuring and killing dozens of Native Hawaiians on the beach, including possibly High Chief Kanaʻina. Cook's ships did not leave Kealakekua bay until February 22nd. They remained for another week to continue repair of the mast and collect better quality drinking water. [...] According to John Ledyard's journal's hundreds of natives were shot in a series of ongoing skirmishes. The ships cannon was used on several occasions among the natives and a large portion of Kireekakooa, the southern town in the bay, was burned.|$|E
