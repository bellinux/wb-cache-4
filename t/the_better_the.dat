5|$|Beef steak is graded for quality, {{with higher}} prices for higher quality. Generally, the higher the quality, the more tender the beef, the less time is needed for cooking, or <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>the</b> flavor. For example, beef fillet is the most tender and wagyu, such as Kobe beef from Japan, {{is known for its}} high quality and {{commands}} a high price. Steak can be cooked relatively quickly compared to other cuts of meat, particularly when cooked at very high temperatures, such as by broiling or grilling.|$|E

25|$|Mixing is an {{important}} parameter, especially in SAAU because the alkylation reaction depends on the emulsion of the hydrocarbon into the sulfuric acid. This is an acid continuous emulsion and it is presumed that the reaction occurs at the interface of acid and hydrocarbon. <b>The</b> <b>better</b> <b>the</b> emulsion, the finer the droplets and <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>the</b> reaction.|$|E

The MSD values can be determined by three types of the S/N ratio characteristics: nominal <b>the</b> <b>better,</b> smaller <b>the</b> <b>better,</b> and greater <b>the</b> <b>better.</b> According to Eq. (1), the friction coefficient value decreases when the ratio force FZ/Fy increases.

25|$|Stability is the {{principle}} that describes how well the denture base is prevented from moving in a horizontal plane, and thus sliding {{from side to side}} or front to back. The more the denture base (pink material) is in smooth and continuous contact with the edentulous ridge (the hill upon which the teeth used to reside, but now only residual alveolar bone with overlying mucosa), <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>the</b> stability. Of course, the higher and broader the ridge, <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>the</b> stability will be, but this is usually a result of patient anatomy, barring surgical intervention (bone grafts, etc.).|$|E
25|$|The finer the {{particle}} {{size of an}} activated carbon, <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>the</b> access to the surface area and the faster the rate of adsorption kinetics. In vapour phase systems {{this needs to be}} considered against pressure drop, which will affect energy cost. Careful consideration of particle size distribution can provide significant operating benefits.|$|E
25|$|Retention is the {{principle}} that describes how well the denture is prevented from moving vertically {{in the opposite direction}} of insertion. <b>The</b> <b>better</b> <b>the</b> topographical mimicry of the intaglio (interior) surface of the denture base {{to the surface of the}} underlying mucosa, <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>the</b> retention will be (in removable partial dentures, the clasps are a major provider of retention), as surface tension, suction and friction will aid in keeping the denture base from breaking intimate contact with the mucosal surface. It is important to note that the most critical element in the retentive design of a maxillary complete denture is a complete and total border seal (complete peripheral seal) in order to achieve 'suction'. The border seal is composed of the edges of the anterior and lateral aspects and the posterior palatal seal. The posterior palatal seal design is accomplished by covering the entire hard palate and extending not beyond the soft palate and ending 1–2mm from the vibrating line.|$|E

25|$|The {{availability}} of skills {{depends on the}} particular genre the GURPS game is played.

25|$|The {{dominating}} parameter influencing {{ozone generation}} efficiency is the gas temperature, which {{is controlled by}} cooling water temperature and/or gas velocity.

25|$|Breath-ability: In general, wool’s comfort {{comes from}} its thermo-balance characteristics. The Breath-ability factor of a {{material}} {{depends on its}} ability to absorb moisture relative to its weight and then release it into the air. The higher the absorption value <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>the</b> textile is at adapting to humidity level changes. Wool can absorb over 30% of moisture, greater than Cotton (25%) and far greater than polyester which can only absorb 1% of its weight.|$|E
25|$|Telescopic rods {{are popular}} among surf fishermen. Carrying around a 12 or 14ft surf fishing rod, even in two pieces, is cumbersome. The shorter the {{sections}} the shorter they close, the more eyes they have, and <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>the</b> power curve is in them. More eyes means better weight and stress distribution throughout the parabolic arc. This translates to further casting, stronger fish fighting abilities, and less {{breaking of the}} rod.|$|E

25|$|The {{average of}} grades {{obtained}} in all subjects (now including Physical Education) represents {{a part of}} the application grade to enter college.

25|$|A {{handicap}} is {{a numerical}} measure of an amateur golfer's {{ability to play}} golf {{over the course of}} 18 holes. A player's handicap generally represents the number of strokes above par that the player will make over the course of an above-average round of golf. <b>The</b> <b>better</b> <b>the</b> player the lower their handicap is. Someone with a handicap of 0 or less is often called a scratch golfer, and would typically score or beat the course par on a round of play (depending on course difficulty).|$|E

25|$|More competition, also {{referred}} to as more interfering activation, leads to poorer recall when tested.

According to the competition hypothesis, less activation would result in better recall. Whereas the accessibility view predicts higher metamemory ratings in interference conditions, the competition hypothesis predicts lower ratings.|$|E
