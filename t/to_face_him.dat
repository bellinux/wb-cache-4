25|$|A kind of torch {{bearer of}} the Vincent J. McMahon-era WWWF, Gorilla Monsoon was rabidly {{supported}} by New York audiences.

Upon that outcome, the crowd became livid and chased Hogan when he was leaving the arena, turning over his car. Policemen on horses had to be summoned to quiet the mob.|$|E
