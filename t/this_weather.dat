5|$|Along the San Francisco peninsula, {{gaps in the}} Santa Cruz Mountains, one {{south of}} San Bruno Mountain and another in Crystal Springs, allow oceanic weather into the {{interior}} and causing a cooling effect for cities along the Peninsula and even {{as far south as}} San Jose. <b>This</b> <b>weather</b> pattern is also the source for delays at San Francisco International Airport. In Marin county north of the Golden Gate strait, two gaps north of Muir Woods bring cold air across the Marin Headlands, with the cooling affect reaching as far north as Santa Rosa. Further inland, the East Bay receives oceanic weather that travels through the Golden Gate strait, and further diffuses that air through the Berkeley Hills, Niles Canyon and the Hayward Pass into the Livermore Valley and Altamont Pass. Here, the resulting breeze is so strong that it is home to one of the world's largest array of wind turbines. Further north, the Carquinez Strait funnels the ocean weather into the San Joaquin River Delta, causing a cooling effect in Stockton and Sacramento, so that these cities are also cooler than their Central Valley counterparts in the south.|$|E
5|$|Unbeknown to Bompart's force, Humbert's {{army and}} the {{rebellion}} as a whole had been defeated by the British Army a week before Bompart departed France. Bompart's squadron too was woefully understrength consisting of only a single ship {{of the line and}} eight frigates carrying 3,000 men. This small force faced {{a large proportion of the}} British Channel Fleet, which was prepared for a second invasion attempt after Humbert's army had landed unopposed in August. As a result, Bompart's force was spotted just a few hours after he left Brest and he was then chased into the Atlantic Ocean by several British frigates which followed him for a week until he was able to lose them in heavy weather. <b>This</b> <b>weather</b> persisted throughout the campaign, causing significant damage to both sides in a series of storms.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of another aviary and captive reproduction center was considered throughout 2013, with {{the municipalities of}} Maricao and Isabela being analyzed. In November 2013, plans {{for the establishment of}} a third population in the Maricao State Forest were formally announced. The following month, ten amazons were released at Río Abajo. 2013 set a new record for the reproduction program, which produced 51 fledglings and shattered the previous record of 34 that was established in 2011. The wild population grew by 15 chicks, an improvement from the 12 born during the previous year. During this time frame, the known number of amazon specimens rounded 500 individuals. A severe drought caused by the emergence of El Niño began during the spring of 2015 and extended throughout the summer, benefitting the breeding of the amazons in El Yunque by extending their reproductive season. However, <b>this</b> <b>weather</b> pattern also increased the number of mongooses present in the forest, representing a risk for the population. On August 13, 2015, a group of 25 amazons was moved from the other aviaries to a repurposed installation in Maricao. Each member was brought individually in order to ensure their safety while being transported and later placed in an acclimation program that is expected to last a year, before they are released to create a new population in the region.|$|E

25|$|The 2006 Central Pacific cyclone, {{also known}} as 91C.INVEST or Storm 91C, was an unusual weather storm that formed in 2006. Forming on October 30, from a {{mid-latitude}} cyclone in the north Pacific mid-latitudes, it moved over waters warmer than normal. The system acquired some features more typical of subtropical or even tropical cyclones. However, as it neared western North America, the system fell apart. Moisture from its remnants caused substantial rainfall in British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest. The exact status and nature of <b>this</b> <b>weather</b> event is unknown, with meteorologists and weather agencies having differing opinions.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to weather}} conditions, peanuts are usually planted in Spring. The peanut {{comes from a}} yellow flower which bends over and infiltrates the soil after {{blooming}} and wilting, and the peanut starts {{to grow in the}} soil. Peanuts are harvested from late August to October, while the weather is clear. <b>This</b> <b>weather</b> allows for dry soil so that when picked, the soil does not stick to the stems and pods. The peanuts are then removed from vines and transported to a peanut shelling machine for mechanical drying. After cropping, the peanuts are delivered to warehouses for cleaning, where they are stored unshelled in silos.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} half year, {{the air on}} the Swiss Plateau can stay still, with little {{exchange}} to rest of the atmosphere, building a lake of cold air on the plateau and often a ceiling of high fog. The clouds look like an ocean of fog when seen from above, (usually around 800m) and hence is called the 'nebelmeer'. <b>This</b> <b>weather</b> is called inversion because the temperature below the fog {{is lower than the}} temperature above. Sometimes, it lasts for days or even for weeks, during which the neighbouring regions of the Alps and the Jura can have the brightest sunshine. Typical for the high fog is the bise, a cold wind from northeast. Since it is channelled by the Swiss Plateau narrowing in southwest, it reaches its major strength in the lake Geneva region where wind speeds of 60km/h with top speeds of more than 100km/h are usual in typical bise weather. The regions near the Alps of the central and eastern plateau sometimes have temperature rises due to the warm foehn wind.|$|E

50|$|Polysulfone {{has one of}} {{the highest}} service {{temperatures}} among all melt-processable thermoplastics. Its resistance to high temperatures gives it a role of a flame retardant, without compromising its strength that usually results from addition of flame retardants. Its high hydrolysis stability allows its use in medical applications requiring autoclave and steam sterilization. However, it has low resistance to some solvents and undergoes weathering; <b>this</b> <b>weathering</b> instability can be offset by adding other materials into the polymer.|$|R

500|$|In 1899, Rhodes took 179 wickets at {{an average}} of 17.10 in a {{reasonably}} dry season; <b>this</b> <b>weather</b> meant that pitches were harder, easier to bat on, and less likely to suit his bowling. Wisden described him as [...] "head and shoulders above his colleagues". He made his Test debut in the five-match series against Australia, playing in three of the five Tests; his first Test coincided with W. G. Grace's last. As well as Grace, his team-mates included C. B. Fry, K. S. Ranjitsinhji, and George Hirst. Rhodes opened the English bowling and took four wickets for 58 in an Australian total of 252; his first Test wicket was Monty Noble (whose wicket he took again in the second innings). He was described by Wisden as bowling [...] "steady and well" [...] on the first day. Rhodes took three wickets in the second Test, but the selectors omitted him from the third match, a decision Wisden believed was mistaken. He did not play again until the final Test, and he finished with 13 wickets in the series, equal with J. T. Hearne as England's leading Test wicket-taker for the summer. Rhodes was also selected to represent the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's {{for the first time that}} season, although W. G. Grace and C. B. Fry scored heavily against him.|$|E

In this paper, we present a method to simulate <b>this</b> very important <b>weathering</b> process. Our method is physically inspired and provides full control to designers, keeping plausible results. First, specific polluted zones are detected according to their real physical classification. Then, the modifications of aspect of each zone are computed.

2500|$|Vancouver is [...] from Hollywood, {{a three-hour}} {{airplane}} flight or a 21-hour drive. It {{is also in}} the same time zone as Los Angeles. This relative proximity coupled with government subsidies is {{a major factor in the}} growth of Vancouver's production industry. Proximity reduces issues over operating hours, accessibility, travel time for principals, access to filmmaking infrastructure, and experience of crews. Another reason why foreign producers choose Vancouver to film is because of the consistent cloud cover as <b>this</b> <b>weather</b> naturally diffuses natural sunlight which makes it easier for technicians to add additional light.|$|E
2500|$|On May 28, 1889, a {{low-pressure}} area formed over Nebraska and Kansas. By {{the time}} <b>this</b> <b>weather</b> pattern reached western Pennsylvania two days later, it had developed into {{what would be}} termed the heaviest rainfall event that had ever been recorded {{in that part of}} the United States. The U.S. Army Signal Corps estimated that [...] of rain fell in 24 hours over the region. During the night, small creeks became roaring torrents, ripping out trees and debris.

2500|$|Above average {{rainfall}} and below average temperatures {{beginning in the}} summer of 1992 resulted in above-normal soil moisture and reservoir levels in the Missouri and Upper Mississippi River basins. <b>This</b> <b>weather</b> pattern persisted throughout the following autumn. [...] During the winter of 1992–93, the region experienced heavy snowfall. These conditions were followed by persistent spring weather patterns that produced storms over the same locations. Soils across much of the affected area were saturated by June 1, with additional rainfall all running off into streams and rivers, instead of soaking into the ground. These wet-weather conditions contrasted sharply with the droughts and heat waves experienced in the southeastern United States.|$|E

50|$|Bronze insect {{screening}} is {{much more}} expensive, but gives much longer service than either aluminum or fiberglass.

Less common screen fabrics include copper, brass, stainless steel, and galvanized steel. For coastal locations, corrosion resistance usually requires the use of bronze or synthetic screening fabric.|$|R
