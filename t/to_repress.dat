5|$|Joseph died in February 1790 and {{was soon}} succeeded by his brother Leopold II. Leopold, himself a {{confirmed}} liberal, made an armistice with the Turks and withdrew 30,000 troops <b>to</b> <b>repress</b> the rebellion in Brabant. On 27 July 1790, Leopold signed the Reichenbach Convention with Prussia which allowed the Emperor to begin the reconquest of the Austrian Netherlands as long as its local traditions were respected. An amnesty was offered to all revolutionaries who surrendered to the Austrian forces.|$|E
5|$|Ramsay Weston Phipps (10 April 1838 – 24 June 1923) was an Irish-born {{military}} {{historian and}} officer in Queen Victoria's Royal Artillery. The son of Pownoll Phipps, {{an officer of}} the British East India Company's army, he was descended from the early settlers of the West Indies; many generations had served in the British, and the English military. Phipps served in the Crimean War, had a stint of duty at Malta, and helped <b>to</b> <b>repress</b> the Fenian uprising in Canada in 1866.|$|E
5|$|During Warwick's exile, King Edward {{stripped}} Montagu of the Earldom of Northumberland, {{making him}} Marquis of Montagu instead. John Neville {{appears to have}} seen this as a reduction in rank, and accepted it with poor grace. He seems particularly to have complained {{about the lack of}} landed estate that his new marquisate brought with it, calling it a 'pie's nest'. When the Earl of Warwick and Clarence returned, they distracted Edward with a rebellion in the north, which the king ordered Montagu to raise troops <b>to</b> <b>repress</b> in the king's name. Montagu, however, having raised a small army, turned against Edward, almost capturing him at Olney, Buckinghamshire; the king, with his other brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, fled into exile in Burgundy.|$|E

5|$|In an epilogue, Charlie is {{discovered}} {{by his parents}} in a catatonic state and does not show any movement despite being hit reluctantly by his father. After being admitted to a mental hospital, it is revealed that Helen actually sexually abused {{him when he was}} young, and his love for her (and empathy for her troubled youth) caused him <b>to</b> <b>repress</b> his traumatic memories. This psychological damage explains his flashbacks and derealization phases throughout the book. In two months Charlie is released, and Sam and Patrick visit him. In the epilogue, Sam, Patrick and Charlie go through the tunnel again and Charlie stands up and exclaims that he felt infinite.|$|E
5|$|Many protein-coding genes {{have more}} than one {{polyadenylation}} site, so a gene can code for several mRNAs that differ in their 3' end. Since alternative polyadenylation changes the length of the 3' untranslated region, it can change which binding sites for microRNAs the 3' untranslated region contains. MicroRNAs tend <b>to</b> <b>repress</b> translation and promote degradation of the mRNAs they bind to, although there are examples of microRNAs that stabilise transcripts. Alternative polyadenylation can also shorten the coding region, thus making the mRNA code for a different protein, but this is much less common than just shortening the 3' untranslated region.|$|E
5|$|The Cabildo met at 9am and {{rejected}} Cisneros' resignation. They considered that {{the crowd had}} no legitimate right to influence something that the Cabildo had already decided and implemented. They considered that, as the Junta was in command, the demonstration should be suppressed by force, and made the members responsible for any changes to {{the resolution of the}} previous day. To enforce those orders, they summoned the chief commanders, but these did not obey. Many of them, including Saavedra, did not appear. Those that did stated that they could not support the government order, and that the commanders would be disobeyed if they ordered the troops <b>to</b> <b>repress</b> the demonstrators.|$|E

His reported blackouts later stopped after an operation in 1949.|$|R
5000|$|Freud {{listed the}} {{distorting}} operations that he claimed were applied <b>to</b> <b>repressed</b> wishes in forming the dream as recollected: {{it is because}} of these distortions (the so-called [...] "dream-work") that the manifest content of the dream differs so greatly from the latent dream thought reached through analysis—and it is by reversing these distortions that the latent content is approached.|$|R
5|$|The poem is an elegy in {{name but}} not in form; it employs a style {{similar to that of}} {{contemporary}} odes, but it embodies a meditation on death, and remembrance after death. The poem argues that the remembrance can be good and bad, and the narrator finds comfort in pondering the lives of the obscure rustics buried in the churchyard. The two versions of the poem, Stanzas and Elegy, approach death differently; the first contains a stoic response to death, but the final version contains an epitaph which serves <b>to</b> <b>repress</b> the narrator's fear of dying. With its discussion of, and focus on, the obscure and the known, the poem has possible political ramifications, but it does not make any definite claims on politics to be more universal in its approach to life and death.|$|E
5|$|In August 1939, Wavell {{ordered a}} plan covertly to {{encourage}} a rebellion in the western Ethiopian province of Gojjam, which the Italians {{had never been able}} entirely <b>to</b> <b>repress</b> {{after the end of the}} Second Italo-Ethiopian War in May 1936. In September, Colonel D. A. Sandford arrived to run the project but until the Italian declaration of war, the conspiracy was held back by the British policy of appeasement, intended to avoid a simultaneous war with Germany and Italy. Mission 101 was formed to co-ordinate the activities of the Ethiopian resistance, known as the Arbegnoch. In June 1940, Haile Selassie arrived in Egypt and in July, went to Sudan to meet Platt and discuss plans to re-capture Ethiopia, despite Platt's reservations. In July, the British recognised Selassie as emperor of Ethiopia and in August, Mission 101 entered Gojjam province to reconnoitre. Sandford requested that supply routes to the area north of Lake Tana be established before the rains ended and that Selassie should return in October as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of Lake Tana, to Dangila, Debra Markos and Addis Ababa, to prevent them concentrating against the Arbegnoch. Italian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissension between local potentates were being reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Aldermach Maggotbone {{is ready}} to hand over his title {{as the leader of}} Hell to his daughter, Callie. However, Callie does not want to take over his job. A {{competition}} is held to choose which one will overtake the title and Callie tries to lose every challenge, but Twayne makes sure that she wins each time. At the studio where Dishonorable Discharge was filmed, Grimes forces some bystanders to act in his ending of the series, which reveals the memory Grimes had repressed: While trying to take down Aldermach when he became the new leader of Hell, Grimes accidentally killed a disguised Jimmy. In present time, Mark, Grimes and Randall head back to New York to sabotage the new ceremony. At the ceremony, Aldermach unexpectedly chooses to give the Slitherix (a big snake one has to swallow to become the leader of Hell) to his secretary, Cathy, to spare Callie from getting the job. Just as Cathy is about to receive the snake, Grimes crashes the car into the church and shoots her. It is then revealed that she is really Grimes' old partner Jimmy, who had worked undercover in Hell for 35 years. Embarrassed, Grimes begins <b>to</b> <b>repress</b> his memories again, which Mark believes is for the best. The episode ends with an angel waking up, suggesting that the episode was her dream.|$|E
50|$|Dance in Africa {{is deeply}} {{integrated}} into society and major {{events in a}} community are frequently reflected in dances: dances are performed for births and funerals, weddings and wars. Traditional dances impart cultural morals, including religious traditions and sexual standards; give vent <b>to</b> <b>repressed</b> emotions, such as grief; motivate community members to cooperate, whether fighting wars or grinding grain; enact spiritual rituals; and contribute to social cohesiveness.|$|R
5000|$|Jung {{called the}} UFO {{phenomenon}} a [...] "living myth", {{a legend in}} the process of consolidation. Belief in a messianic encounter with UFOs demonstrated the point, Jung argued, that even if a rationalistic modern ideology repressed the images of the collective unconscious, its fundamental aspects would inevitably resurface. The circular shape of the flying saucer confirms its symbolic connection <b>to</b> <b>repressed</b> but psychically necessary ideas of divinity.|$|R

50|$|BHLHE41 {{has been}} shown <b>to</b> <b>represses</b> myogenic {{differentiation}} by inhibiting MyoD activity through multiple mechanisms. When BHLHE41 dimerizes with MyoD and E47, it prevents the formation of MyoD-E47 heterodimers, which are functional. When BHLHE41 is sumoylated at K240 and K255, it recruits the histone methyltransferase G9a. G9a then catalyzes repressive histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) at promoter sites of target genes of MyoD. G9a also methylates MyoD, which inhibits MyoD's transcriptional activity.|$|R
