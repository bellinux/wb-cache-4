5|$|When Bjarne Riis {{took over}} in winter 2000, he hired the former Danish Ranger Corps soldier B.S. Christiansen as advisor and they gave CSC a {{distinct}} philosophy and training methods. The team works with four values: communication, loyalty, commitment and respect, {{with the aim of}} improving teamwork. The team rides for the rider in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shape</b> on the day, and separates the function of team captain (the rider making decisions) and team leader (the rider trying to win) to avoid pressure on a single rider.|$|E
5|$|There {{was much}} {{speculation}} {{going into the}} Stakes over Secretariat's bid for the Triple Crown. Since 1948, when Citation achieved the feat, there had been six horses that had won both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes before failing in the Belmont Stakes. When comparing Secretariat to those six horses' health and fitness before the Belmont Stakes, writer Bonifice felt Secretariat was in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shape,</b> {{almost as good as}} when he entered the Kentucky Derby weeks prior. Just days before the Belmont, Secretariat ran five furlongs in just under a minute in a morning workout. Following that, Secretariat's jockey Ron Turcotte told reporters that Secretariat was ready for a top charge on Saturday.|$|E
5|$|From 06:00 Wellington was in {{the field}} supervising the {{deployment}} of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under Bülow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo {{as it was in}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shape,</b> not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and Bülow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along Bülow's intended route. As a result, {{the last part of the}} corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. Bülow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.|$|E

25|$|The {{fight was}} signed for May 22, 1993, and was staged at RFK Stadium in Washington, DC. Ferguson {{came into the}} fight below 230 pounds {{for the first time}} in years and was {{considered}} to be in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shape</b> of his career. Because the IBF did not consider Ferguson to be a legitimate contender, they would not sanction the defense for Bowe and only the WBA and lineal championships were on the line. Ferguson thought he had a legitimate chance to knock the champion out, but Bowe disregarded his boasts. Ferguson was knocked down toward the end of the first round and barely made it back to his feet at the bell, then was dropped again as the second round began and knocked out.|$|E

Mason found the producer's behaviour [...] "erratic", but used his elaborate and unlikely excuses for his lateness as ammunition for [...] "tongue-in-cheek resentment". [...] Ezrin's share of the royalties was less {{than the rest of}} the band and he viewed Waters as a [...] "bully", especially when the bassist mocked him by having badges made that read NOPE (No Points Ezrin), alluding to his lesser share of the album's royalties.

[...] Aidoo was rewarded with {{a spot on the}} active roster. He played in 16 regular season games, mostly on special teams. He finished the season with a career-high seven special teams tackles in 17 games, along with a single reception and two carries.|$|E
5000|$|The Society began {{immediately}} to cultivate knowledge of horticulture in Ottawa. In 1893 it published a pamphlet that listed <b>the</b> <b>best</b> annuals, perennials, and vegetables for the Ottawa region.

Geranium slips {{were given to the}} juniors with prizes for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shaped</b> plants and <b>the</b> most flowers. In 1916 the book [...] "Ottawa, A City of Gardens" [...] was published for the society by R.B. Whyte.|$|R

500|$|The {{destruction}} of the standard measurements led to {{an overhaul of the}} British weights and measures system. An inquiry that ran from 1838 to 1841 considered the two competing systems used in the country, the avoirdupois and troy measures, and decided that avoirdupois would be used forthwith; troy weights were retained solely for gold, silver and precious stones. The destroyed weights and measures were recast by William Simms, the scientific instrument maker, who produced the replacements after [...] "countless hours of tests and experiments to determine the best metal, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shape</b> of bar, and the corrections for temperature".|$|E

30|$|The {{representation}} of the parameter space has {{a major influence on}} the precision of the detection and also on its complexity. The most classical method consists in quantising every dimension of the parameter space according to the desired precision of the detection, voting by simply incrementing the nearest node of the quantised space, and then choosing the highest local maxima as <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shapes.</b> This is what is done for the one-to-many methods because a sufficiently high precision is needed to draw significant dual surfaces in the parameter space.|$|R

2500|$|By March 2002, Woodland Cemetery {{suffered}} extensively lack of maintenance. Numerous headstones and mausoleums {{had been}} defaced by graffiti, many gravestones had been toppled and some destroyed, and the grounds were strewn with trash and liquor bottles. Most of the cemetery's unpaved roads were impassable. [...] When Plain Dealer reporters interviewed Jim Glending, acting city properties chief, about the cemetery, he ordered {{an assessment of}} each cemetery so a repair and maintenance plan could be developed. While the public and press blamed the very small budget for cemetery maintenance for the problems, some did not. Vicki Blum Vigil, {{author of a book}} on Cuyahoga County cemeteries, claimed that maintenance at Woodland Cemetery was better than at many privately owned cemeteries. Vigil blamed vandalism and an increasing number of cemetery visitors for Woodland's problems. The Plain Dealer report led to extensive maintenance improvements at Woodland over the next three months. Although mausoleums remains in disrepair and heavier monuments remained toppled due to lack of equipment to right them, a spokesperson for the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War claimed the cemetery was in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shape</b> it had been in for the past ten years.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his plans}} to {{recapture}} Shandong, Zhang Zongchang {{had a number of}} important assets: firstly, tens of thousands of his former soldiers still remained in Shandong. Most of them {{had not been able to}} join the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) after Zhang's defeat, and remained unemployed. In a precarious economic situation and mostly still loyal to their old commander, they joined his forces for a second time. These ex-soldiers were not necessarily reliable nor combat-effective, however. In the face of the Nationalist forces during the Northern Expedition, Zhang's followers had [...] "melted away without putting up much of a fight", and were even more lacking in training and weaponry now that they had been demobilized. While Zhang's forces were not in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shape,</b> they had the advantage of not having to face regular NRA troops in eastern Shandong, as the area was under the control of Zhang's former associate Liu Zhennian. Liu had defected to the Nationalists during the Northern Expedition, and was awarded to rule eastern Shandong like an [...] "unreformed warlord" [...] without intervention since October 1928. Although de jure part of the NRA, Liu's forces were typical of the average warlord, and suffered from little training in comparison to regular armies. Liu was not particularly loyal to the Nationalist government in Nanjing, and he had no support from the local population which he had terrorized, having driven them into rebellion in some areas. The counties of Laiyang and Zhaoyuan were held by Red Spear Society peasant insurgents by early 1929. Lastly, Zhang possibly had covert support from the Empire of Japan, which increased his confidence in recapturing Shandong.|$|E
