40|$|An {{experimental}} setup {{of double}} pipe heat exchanger fouling test rig {{was built to}} investigate the mineral scale deposition on different heat exchanger pipe surfaces. Progressive fouling deposition on different material surfaces under the similar solution conditions were observed and analyzed. Measurable data on the progressive build-up of scale deposits, deposition rate, {{as well as the}} composition and crystal morphology of the deposits were studied after each experimental run by analyzing the deposited scale on the <b>test</b> <b>pipes.</b> In this research the artificial calcium carbonate deposit on different material surfaces is considered as {{it is one of the}} major constituents of the most scales found in heat exchanging equipment. Fouling on different smooth <b>test</b> <b>pipes</b> were investigated in the centrally located larger concentric pipe heat exchanger. Uniform flow condition near the pipe surface was maintained by constant flow rate throughout the system. The calcium carbonate deposition rates on five different metal surfaces (Stainless steel 316, brass, copper, aluminium and carbon steel) were investigated. The results illustrated an upward trend for fouling rate with time on the tested specimens. The deposition on the surfaces showed a linear growth with the enhancement of thermal conductivity of the metals. However, deposition on carbon steel metal surfaces did not follow the typical linear trend of thermal conductivity over deposition as its surface was altered by corrosion effects. In addition, temperature, velocity, and concentration effects on fouling deposition were investigated on the SS 316 metal surface. It is noted that the fouling deposition increases with the increase of temperature and concentration due to enhanced deposition potential whereas reduces due to the increase of velocity which enhances shear stress. © 2017 Elsevier B.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the case}} of sudden valve closure, water hammer creates the most {{powerful}} pressure and damage to pipeline systems. The best way to protect the pipeline system is to eliminate water hammer. The main reasons for water hammer occurrence are valve closure, high initial velocity, and static pressure.

In this study, the pipe fracture caused by static water pressure, gradually increasing pressure, and suddenly increasing pressure were compared experimentally in a breaking PVC <b>test</b> <b>pipe.</b> The quasi-static zone, the dynamic zone, and the transition zone are defined through the results of those experiments, with consideration of the fracture patterns of test pipes and impulses.

40|$|The biomass {{production}} potential (BPP) test is a semi-static test for assessment of growth promoting properties of construction products {{in contact with}} drinking water (CPDW) under defined conditions. The test is performed at the product¿s surface to water volume contact ratio (S/V) of 0. 16 cm- 1, that {{is quite different from}} the practice in buildings and domestic installations. The goal of this study was to evaluate the importance of the S/V ratio for performance of the BPP test and for correct determining the enhancement of microbial growth by CPDW. The BPP of 10 pipe products were compared under the S/V ratios of 0. 16 cm- 1 and 1. 6 cm- 1 in two consecutive trials. Our study found out that the BPP test at the originally proposed S/V contact ratio is a reliable approach for assessment of growth promoting properties of CPDW. The data showed that under the S/V ratio of 0. 16 cm- 1 the test achieves similar results for the BPP of the <b>tested</b> <b>pipe</b> materials as with a more realistic S/V ratio of 1. 6 cm- 1. However, the S/V ratio showed a significant effect on the planktonic biomass concentration and heterotrophic plate count in the test waters in contact with the <b>tested</b> <b>pipe</b> materials and that stronger effect on the water quality can be important from hygienic point of view. Therefore, the impact of the S/V contact ratio on drinking water quality should be taken into consideration for assessment of the products in contact with drinking water. For acceptance of the CPDW, besides a Pass/Fail Criterion for the BPP, a second criterion for evaluation of materials on their effect of drinking water quality needs to be developed and the planktonic biomass concentration could be useful one for this purpose.
