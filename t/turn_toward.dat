5|$|Late on December 29, {{more than}} four weeks after the {{official}} end to the season, a tropical disturbance developed in the east-central Atlantic. It quickly became more organized and was declared Tropical Depression Thirty on December 30. The next day, Thirty was declared a tropical storm naming it Zeta. Zeta made a <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> the west but stalled and gradually weakened until dissipating on January 6, 2006.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} Colonel Michaelis {{went to the}} 1st Cavalry Division command post in Hwanggan and asked {{division}} commander Major General Hobart R. Gay for permission to withdraw his regiment through that division. Gay telephoned the Eighth Army headquarters {{and asked if he}} should attack in an effort to relieve the pressure on the 27th Infantry, or if that regiment should withdraw into the 1st Cavalry Division's area, move south to Kumch'on, and then <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> Sangju to rejoin the 25th Division. The Eighth Army decided the 27th Regiment should withdraw, as Gay feared it would quickly be surrounded if it tried to hold its position.|$|E
5|$|While the Slaying of Goliath is a {{relatively}} simple composition with the two protagonists centrally placed and the only other figures being dimly seen observers, the Brazen Serpent picture is crowded with figures and separate incidents as the various individuals who have been attacked by snakes struggle and die or <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> the icon that will save them. This is the most Mannerist of Michelangelo's earlier compositions at the Sistine Chapel, picking up the theme of human distress begun in the Great Flood scene and carrying it forward into the torment of lost souls in the Last Judgement, which was later painted below.|$|E
40|$|This study {{explored}} the Existential Analytic grieving activity of <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> loss. Four women, each bereaved of either a parent, spouse, child, or sibling, participated {{in one hour}} interviews. The research question was, “what is the lived experience of <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> loss?” To understand how participants encountered and engaged with their grief, a hermeneutic phenomenological method was employed. Through lived experience descriptions, eight thematic meaning structures were revealed: (a) encounter with death, (b) surrendering to grief, (c) choosing community, (d) permitting and pursuing grief, (e) transformation of self, (f) rooting in relationship, (g) embracing life, and (h) ground of faith. From the thematic meanings emerged the metaphor of a labyrinth of grief, which symbolized the various paradoxes of grieving, signifying that <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> loss was essentially spiritual and transformative. In describing how they <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> their losses, the participants highlighted the inherent relational and dialogical nature of grieving. <b>Turning</b> <b>toward</b> lossExistential Analysisgrievinggrief workgrief encounterhermeneutic phenomenologylived experiencelabyrinthparadoxmetapho...|$|R

5|$|After {{moderate}} {{sales of}} their debut album Cheshire Cat (1995), released on independent record label Cargo Music, Blink-182 enjoyed {{a small amount}} of success. Throughout 1994 and 1995, the trio vigorously toured nonstop and grew in popularity, mostly in Australia, where audiences embraced the band's irreverent sense of humor and stage shows. When the trio grew frustrated when fans lamented the inability to purchase Cheshire Cat at their respective local record stores, they began to <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> other record labels to achieve wider distribution than Cargo. By the end of 1995, problems had become apparent between the trio and the label, who regarded the band as a joke not to be taken seriously.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its size}} and {{electrical}} defenses, the marbled electric ray does not often fall prey to other animals such as sharks. This species exhibits different defensive behaviors depending on whether a prospective predator grasps it by the disc or the tail. A ray touched on the disc will quickly <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> the threat while producing electric shocks; {{this is followed by}} it fleeing in a straight line, after which it may re-bury itself. A ray touched on the tail will propel itself upward into a loop; if it has not escaped after the maneuver, the ray will curl into a ring with the belly facing outward, so as to present the area of its body with the highest electric field gradient (the underside of the electric organs) towards the threat; these behaviors are accompanied by short, strong electric shocks. The ray tends to produce more electric bursts when protecting its tail than when protecting its disc.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} August 10, {{computer}} models anticipated the hurricane to accelerate {{to the northeast}} and become extratropical within three days, but this did not materialize. A westerly trough that had been influencing Alberto’s motion outran the storm, and a strong ridge developed {{to the north and}} west, causing the storm to turn abruptly to the south on August 15, and to complete a large loop over the open Atlantic. Alberto turned to the southwest on August 16 and to the west on August 17. The storm then took a sharp <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> the northwest as a large, slow-moving mid-level trough was carving out over the eastern United States. Alberto began to strengthen, and reached hurricane status for the third time on August 18. The hurricane continued to turn to the north on August 19 and to the northeast on August 20 and August 21. During this time, Alberto reached a third peak intensity of 105mph (165km/h) on August 20, and a 70mi (110km) wide eye was observed. Operationally, Alberto reached a peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), but after reanalysis, it was reduced to 105mph (165km/h).|$|E

5|$|Even in {{the first}} couple of years of his company, Goldfaden did not shy away from serious themes: his rained-out {{vaudeville}} in Botoşani had been Di Rekruten (The Recruits), playing with the theme of the press gangs working the streets of that town to conscript young men into the army. Before the end of 1876, Goldfaden had already translated Desolate Island by August von Kotzebue; thus, a play by a German aristocrat and Russian spy became the first non-comic play performed professionally in Yiddish. After his initial burst of mostly vaudevilles and light comedies (although Shmendrik and The Two Kuni-Lemls were reasonably sophisticated plays), Goldfaden would go on to write many serious Yiddish-language plays on Jewish themes, perhaps the most famous being Shulamith, also from 1880. Goldfaden himself suggested that this increasingly serious turn became possible because he had educated his audience. Nahma Sandrow suggests that it may have had equally {{as much to do with}} the arrival in Romania, at the time of the Russo-Turkish War, of Russian Jews who had been exposed to more sophisticated Russian language theater. Goldfaden's strong <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> almost uniformly serious subject matter roughly coincided with bringing his troupe to Odessa.|$|E
5|$|Hours after {{attaining}} {{its peak}} intensity, Fred began to weaken as clouds {{began to fill}} the eye. By this time, the hurricane was beginning to <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> the northwest as a subtropical ridge to the north weakened. Continued weakening took place as dry air started to erode convection along {{the southern edge of}} the system and the eye was no longer present on satellite imagery and wind shear also increased. Convection gradually became elongated in response to the shear and outflow was mostly restricted to the northeast region of the hurricane. By September10, the mid-level circulation center was displaced from the low-level circulation center. On September11, the convective pattern of Fred had no organized shape to it and the NHC downgraded the hurricane to a tropical storm. Unrelenting shear and dry air finally took their toll on September12. By that time, no deep convection was associated with the main circulation of Fred, leaving the center fully exposed. The storm degenerated into a remnant-low later that day, corresponding with the final advisory from the National Hurricane Center.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century came another <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> {{nationalist}} politics with Solidaridad Gallega (1907–1912) modeled on Solidaritat Catalana in Catalonia. Solidaridad Gallega failed, but in 1916 Irmandades da Fala (Brotherhood of the Language) developed {{first as a}} cultural association but soon as a full-blown nationalist movement. Vicente Risco and Ramón Otero Pedrayo were outstanding cultural figures of this movement, and the magazine Nós ('Us'), founded 1920, its most notable cultural institution, Lois Peña Novo the outstanding political figure.|$|E
25|$|As {{the spur}} falling north from High Raise {{gradually}} narrows, the ground becomes rockier, until a sudden <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> the east throws up a knuckle of crag. The main face {{is on the}} north western flank, cut by a gully, with the lower slabs providing {{the majority of the}} rock climbing. Bull crag is also on this flank, a little to the south. From Sergeant's Crag the ridge drops slightly before reaching its terminus at Eagle Crag.|$|E

25|$|Such was {{the lack}} of warning that {{there was no time to}} engage in {{defensive}} manoeuvres, leading to a change in British policy whereby any Royal Navy vessel that suspected it might be under missile attack would <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> the threat, accelerate to maximum speed and fire chaff to prevent a ship being caught defenceless again. The codeword used to start this procedure was 'handbrake', which had to be broadcast once the signal of the Agave radar of the Super Étendard was picked up.|$|E
25|$|The main {{forces in}} the Balkans in the 1345 were Serbia, Bulgaria, and the Byzantine Empire. Stefan Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia proclaimed himself Tsar of the new Serbian Empire and {{continued}} his efforts at expansion, quickly conquering Albania and other surrounding areas within the year. The Byzantines, though powerful, were {{in a state of}} decline, with an ongoing civil war between emperors John V Palaiologos and John VI Kantakouzenos, although in 1345, the tide began to <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> the latter. At the same time, the Zealot commune in Thessalonica entered a more radical phase.|$|E
25|$|The Leadville miners' {{strike was}} a labor {{action by the}} Cloud City Miners' Union, which was the Leadville, Colorado local of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM), against those silver mines paying less than $3.00 per day. The strike lasted from 19 June 1896 to 9 March 1897, and {{resulted}} in a major defeat for the union, {{largely due to the}} unified opposition of the mine owners. The failure of the strike caused the WFM to leave the American Federation of Labor (AFL), and is regarded as a cause for the WFM <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> revolutionary socialism.|$|E

The controller asked the pilot to confirm his routing, and he advised the pilot that he was already west of his intended course. The pilot then made a sharp left turn to the southeast, followed by another to the southwest, toward Campbeltown. As the aircraft descended toward Campbeltown, {{it had not been}} on its approved course since it left the immediate vicinity of Glasgow.|$|E

25|$|The {{run for the}} Torres Strait {{was going}} without {{incident}} until an unknown destroyer and freighter were spotted on the 17th headed {{in the opposite direction}} and then on 18 February Don Isidro was attacked twice by a Japanese bomber, though without damage. That attack was decisive in the captain's decision to <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> the friendly port of Darwin. On the morning of the 19th seven Japanese fighters strafed the ship while she was about 25 miles north of Bathurst Island. This attack holed the ship, destroyed all life boats and rafts and wounded a number of crew and defenders. In early afternoon, at about 1:30 (1330) the ship was again attacked by a single bomber and again escaped bomb damage.|$|E
