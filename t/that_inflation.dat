5|$|Funding {{troubles}} delayed construction even further. In March 1980, Maryland officials {{worried that}} high inflation would leave Metro without enough funds {{to complete the}} Green Line, forcing Maryland to pay these construction costs alone. These fears were confirmed in part in September 1980 when Metro announced <b>that</b> <b>inflation</b> had created a $16 million shortfall in its $271 million budget. By now, Anacostia residents were increasingly angry at the repeated delays in building the Green Line. In September 1980, D.C. City Council member Jerry A. Moore, Jr. delivered a petition containing 1,000 signatures from Anacostia residents demanding that construction on the Green Line be sped up.|$|E
5|$|Keynes did not lay out an {{explicit}} theory of price level. Early Keynesian models assumed wage and other price levels were fixed. These assumptions caused little {{concern in the}} 1950s when inflation was stable, but by the mid-1960s inflation increased and became an issue for macroeconomic models. In 1958 A.W. Phillips set {{the basis for a}} price level theory when he made the empirical observation <b>that</b> <b>inflation</b> and unemployment seemed to be inversely related. In 1960 Richard Lipsey provided the first theoretical explanation of this correlation. Generally Keynesian explanations of the curve held that excess demand drove high inflation and low unemployment while an output gap raised unemployment and depressed prices. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Phillips curve faced attacks on both empirical and theoretical fronts. The presumed trade-off between output and inflation represented by the curve was the weakest part of the Keynesian system.|$|E
5|$|The CIP was {{a scheme}} whereby US dollars {{were given to}} the South Vietnamese {{government}} treasury. Selected businesspeople were given import licenses that allowed them to purchase US dollars with South Vietnamese currency at a rate far below the market value. The importers then used their American currency to buy US goods, while the Saigon government kept the South Vietnamese currency paid by the businessmen to fund the military and public service. The objective of the mechanism was to inject large amounts of money into the economy in an indirect way, through material goods, so <b>that</b> <b>inflation</b> would be avoided. However, the initiative failed to generate much economic development, as licenseholders spent most of their funds on consumer goods.|$|E

5|$|In Essai, Cantillon {{provided}} an advanced version of John Locke's quantity theory of money, focusing on relative inflation and {{the velocity of}} money. Cantillon suggested <b>that</b> <b>inflation</b> occurs gradually and that the new supply of money has a localised effect on inflation, effectively originating the concept of non-neutral money. Furthermore, he posited that the original recipients of new money enjoy higher standards of living {{at the expense of}} later recipients. The concept of relative inflation, or a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy, is now known as the Cantillon effect. Cantillon also considered changes in the velocity of money (quantity of exchanges made within a specific amount of time) influential on prices, although not to the same degree as changes in the quantity of money. While he believed that the money supply consisted only of specie, he conceded that increases in money substitutes—or bank notes—could affect prices by effectively increasing the velocity of circulating of deposited specie. Apart from distinguishing money from money substitute, he also distinguished between bank notes offered as receipts for specie deposits and bank notes circulating beyond the quantity of specie—or fiduciary media—suggesting that the volume of fiduciary media is strictly limited by people's confidence in its redeemability. He considered fiduciary media a useful tool to abate the downward pressure that hoarding of specie has on the velocity of money.|$|E
25|$|For example, £100 {{invested}} for one year, earning 5% interest, will {{be worth}} £105 after one year; therefore, £100 paid now and £105 paid exactly one year later both have the same value to a recipient who expects 5% interest assuming <b>that</b> <b>inflation</b> would be zero percent.

S. cities. Similar results are obtained after excluding five of the 18 cities that may be disproportionately impacted by energy shocks. In addition, cointegration analysis shows greater cross-regional price dispersion over time during the higher inflation period of 1978 - 1987 than during 1988 - 1997.

25|$|To {{act as a}} {{store of}} value, a money {{must be able to}} be {{reliably}} saved, stored, and retrieved – and be predictably usable as a medium of exchange when it is retrieved.

25|$|Western {{central banks}} decided to sharply cut {{interest}} rates to encourage growth, deciding <b>that</b> <b>inflation</b> was a secondary concern. Although this was the orthodox macroeconomic prescription at the time, the resulting stagflation surprised economists and central bankers.

Recent research claims that in the period after 1985 the economy became more resilient to energy price increases.|$|E

50|$|Paul Steinhardt, {{one of the}} {{original}} architects of the inflationary model, introduced the first example of eternal inflation in 1983, He showed <b>that</b> the <b>inflation</b> could proceed forever by producing bubbles of non-inflating space filled with hot matter and radiation surrounded by empty space that continues to inflate.

25|$|The era of {{inflation}} targeting—i.e. maintaining inflation within a band—has perhaps begun in Egypt more recently.

25|$|The {{mechanism}} for inflation is unclear, it {{is similar in}} effect to dark energy but {{is a far more}} energetic and short lived process.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the possibility <b>that</b> spiral <b>inflation</b> {{can be realized}} using the near-conifold flux potentials for the complex structure moduli in type IIB string theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold. Using the explicit form of the flux potential for complex structure moduli, we provide analytical and numerical arguments showing <b>that</b> spiral <b>inflation</b> is difficult to support. We also show that for this sector of low energy string theories, a viable spiral inflationary scenario would owe its success to a de Sitter-like vacuum energy, with minimal reliance on the non-gradient flow field trajectories which characterize spiral inflation. We thus conclude {{that even though the}} near conifold region has the requisite multi-sheeted potential called for by spiral inflation, generically it appears <b>that</b> spiral <b>inflation</b> is not realized using the complex structure flux potential alone.

25|$|The {{value of}} the U.S. dollar was {{therefore}} no longer anchored to gold, and it fell upon the Federal Reserve to maintain the {{value of the}} U.S. currency. The Federal Reserve, however, continued to increase the money supply, resulting in stagflation and a rapidly declining value of the U.S. dollar in the 1970s. This was largely due to the prevailing economic view at the time <b>that</b> <b>inflation</b> and real economic growth were linked (the Phillips curve), and so inflation was regarded as relatively benign. Between 1965 and 1981, the U.S. dollar lost two thirds of its value.|$|E
25|$|Cosmic {{inflation}} is a faster-than-light expansion of space {{just after the}} Big Bang. It explains {{the origin of the}} large-scale structure of the cosmos.

25|$|In {{economic}} policy, Thatcher {{started out}} by increasing {{interest rates to}} drive down the money supply. She had a preference for indirect taxation over taxes on income, and value added tax (VAT) rose sharply to 15% with the result <b>that</b> <b>inflation</b> also rose. These moves hit businesses, especially in the manufacturing sector, and unemployment – which had stood at 1,500,000 {{by the time of}} the 1979 general election – was above 2,000,000 by the end of 1980. It continued to rise throughout 1981, passing the 2,500,000 mark during the summer of that year – although inflation was now down to 12% compared to 27% two years earlier.
