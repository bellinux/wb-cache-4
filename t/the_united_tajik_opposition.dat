2500|$|Sayid Abdulloh Nuri (Tajik: Сайид Абдуллоҳи Нурӣ, Perso-Arabic script: سید عبدالله نوری) (March 15, 1947 [...] August 9, 2006), also transliterated as Abdullah Nuri, led the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan from 1993 {{until he}} {{died of cancer in}} late 2006. During the Tajik Civil War of 1992 to 1997 he led <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition.</b> Nuri and President of Tajikistan Emomali Rakhmonov ended the civil war by signing the Tajik National Peace Accord in 1997.|$|E
50|$|The Army is {{overseen by}} the Tajik Defense Ministry. Many units are former militias, {{including}} several that fought the government during the Tajik civil war as part of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Security Council {{noted the}} {{continuing}} {{peace process in}} Tajikistan and the general observance of the ceasefire by <b>the</b> <b>Tajik</b> government and <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition</b> (UTO). <b>The</b> overall situation in the country had improved though some areas remained tense.|$|R
5000|$|President Emomalii Rahmon, <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition</b> (UTO) leader Sayid Abdulloh Nuri and Special Representative of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Nations Secretary-General Gerd Merrem {{signed the}} [...] "General Agreement on the Establishment of Peace and National Accord in Tajikistan" [...] and the [...] "Moscow Protocol" [...] on 27 June 1997 in Moscow, Russia, ending the war.|$|R
50|$|In the {{preamble}} of the resolution, {{it was noted}} that progress in the peace process was very slow, with violations of the ceasefire and a precarious situation {{in some parts of the}} country. Intensified contacts between the Government of Tajikistan and <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition</b> (UTO) had helped to contain the crises.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition</b> (UTO) was an {{alliance}} of democratic, nationalist and Islamist forces that officially banded together in 1993, after the most violent phase of the Tajik Civil War. The UTO fought against the pro-communist and Khujandi/Kulyabi government forces led by Emomali Rakhmon, formerly Emomali Rakhmonov.|$|E
50|$|The Council {{observed}} further {{progress in}} the implementation of the peace agreement between the Government of Tajikistan and <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition</b> (UTO), and the ceasefire was respected. The security situation remained precarious and there violence in the centre of the country, though other parts remained quiet.|$|E

50|$|The Council {{observed}} that {{talks between the}} Tajikistan government and <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition</b> were successfully completed and an agreement was concluded on 27 June 1997. It was noted that {{the implementation of the}} General Agreement would require the effort of all parties and the support of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Nations and <b>the</b> international community, particularly as the situation in Tajikistan remained volatile.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mission was}} {{established}} for an initial period {{of six months}} but would only be extended beyond 6 February 1995 when the parties extended agreements on a durable ceasefire, reconciliation {{and the promotion of}} democracy. Tajikistan was called upon to enter into a Status of Mission Agreement with <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Nations. <b>The</b> Government of Tajikistan and <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition</b> had to reach a political agreement as soon as possible.|$|R
50|$|During the Tajik {{civil war}} in 1992, the Tajikistan {{government}} was supported by Uzbekistan. Helicopters of the Air Force fought the Muslim rebels at a <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition</b> base. Later, <b>the</b> Uzbek Air Force {{was said to have}} destroyed the last holdouts of rebels in eastern Tajikistan. A member of the Uzbek defense ministry was made the Tajik Minister of Defence.|$|R
50|$|In 1998 {{four members}} of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan were murdered by armed men allied with <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition.</b> These victims were Yutaka Akino, a noted Japanese scholar of Central Asian history, Major Ryszard Szewczyk from Poland; Major Adolfo Scharpegge from Uruguay; and Jourajon Mahramov from Tajikistan.|$|E
50|$|Over time, Latifi {{became a}} {{prominent}} opposition figure, {{as a senior}} member in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition.</b> This led to a period in exile in Tehran and Moscow between 1992 and 1997. While in Moscow, on August 4, 1994, Latifi was badly beaten outside his Moscow apartment, and key documents relating {{to the peace process}} were stolen.|$|E
50|$|During {{the next}} {{years and the}} Tajik Civil War, Rastokhez, then underground, {{as well as the}} {{similarly}} minded Democratic Party, participated in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition</b> (UTO) along with more Islamic groups. The party ceased to exist {{at the same time as}} the UTO, its members having mostly joined the Democratic Party at the time of the peace treaty (June 1997).|$|E
25|$|Emomalii Rahmon came {{to power}} in 1994, and {{continues}} to rule to this day. Ethnic cleansing was controversial during the civil war in Tajikistan. By {{the end of the war}} Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and <b>opposition</b> parties (<b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition).</b>|$|R
50|$|In Tajikistan {{there were}} moves to {{implement}} the peace accords and a maintenance of the ceasefire. <b>The</b> <b>Tajik</b> government and <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition</b> (UTO) were in close contact {{in an attempt to}} resolve the crisis. The Council noted that the security situation in parts of the country remained precarious and there were delays in establishing the facts surrounding the murder for four members of UNMOT-a Japanese civil affairs officer, Polish and Uruguayan Majors and a Tajik interpreter-in July 1998.|$|R
50|$|Russia {{provided}} {{much support}} toward {{the creation of}} the national army, and trained command and engineer personnel. An institute of higher military education was created in Tajikistan. Despite the large budget (mostly from Russian taxpayer money) and the adequate training of personnel, {{the creation of the}} national army was proceeding very slowly. The army benefited from several <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition</b> units that were experienced from fighting government forces during the civil war, but as of 2006, were poorly maintained and funded. At that time the army had 44 main battle tanks, 34 armored infantry fighting vehicles, 29 armored personnel carriers, 12 pieces of towed artillery, 10 multiple rocket launchers, 9 mortars, and 20 surface-to-air missiles.|$|R
50|$|Ayombekov {{had been}} a warlord during the 1992 to 1997 Tajik Civil War between <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition</b> and the {{government}} led by President Rahmon Nabiyev. As part of subsequent peace deal between the opposing sides, Ayombekov was given a government post. However, Ayombekov and many other Tajik warlords were gradually driven out. Emomalii Rahmon's government has also accused Ayombekov of tobacco smuggling.|$|E
50|$|Usmon was a field {{commander}} for <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition</b> {{during the}} Tajikistan Civil War of the 1990s. A former Economics Minister, {{he was the}} Islamic Renaissance Party's candidate in the 1991 and 1999 presidential elections. He lost the election to incumbent president, Emomalii Rahmon, gaining only 2.1% of the vote amidst criticism that the election was not free and fair.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{government}} has blamed the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), an Islamist terrorist organization, for the attacks, critics have doubted this. Some have cast blame on Russia, although others have called this unlikely. Another possibility is that forces in the majority-Muslim Tajikistan government were retaliating for Uzbek support for Tajik opposition groups. Tajik terrorist groups have been suggested as well, especially <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition</b> (UTO).|$|E
5000|$|Several Tajik {{associations}} {{operate in}} the US. One is the American-Tajik Association, established in Brooklyn, whose goal is to <b>unite</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tajik</b> diaspora, giving them a forum to gather and celebrate their culture.|$|R
5000|$|Maksud Ibragimov - another <b>Tajik</b> <b>opposition</b> {{politician}} towards whom {{an assassination}} attempt was made in 2014 ...|$|R

5000|$|There {{was concern}} about the deteriorating {{situation}} in Tajikistan, and the Security Council emphasised {{the need for the}} parties concerned to uphold their agreements. The situation would only be resolved through political means between the Government of Tajikistan and <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition</b> and it was their primary responsibility to do so. The resolution also stressed the unacceptability of hostile acts on the border with Afghanistan.|$|E
50|$|Hoji Akbar Turajonzoda (Ҳоҷӣ Акбар Тураҷонзода; born 1954) is a Senator in the National Assembly of Tajikistan. He {{served as}} the Qazi Qalon, the highest Muslim {{authority}} in Tajikistan, from 1988 to 1991. He {{served as the}} second-in-command of the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan and <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition</b> from 1993 until his expulsion from the party in 1999. He served as the Deputy Prime Minister in the Tajik government after the civil war.|$|E
5000|$|The {{group was}} founded in 1990. In 1992, the party hosted a conference in Saratov, Russia, {{attended}} by Islamists from ex-Soviet central Asia, Tatarstan and Bashkortostan. When Tajikistan became independent, it was banned in 1993. It fought with <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition</b> and the Garmi people against the government during the Tajik Civil War but was legalised following peace accords in 1998. In 1999 {{it was the second}} largest party in Tajikistan.|$|E
50|$|Group 24 is a <b>Tajik</b> <b>opposition</b> {{movement}} based predominantly abroad due to repressions inside Tajikistan. The {{movement was}} founded in Moscow in 2012 by Tajik businessman and politician Umarali Quvvatov after he left Tajikistan.|$|R
50|$|The Democratic Party (Ҳизби демократии Тоҷикистон Hizbi Demokratii Tojikiston, حزب دموکرات تاجیکستان) is a {{political}} party in Tajikistan founded in August 1990 by Mahmadruzi Iskandarov. Along with the other <b>Tajik</b> <b>opposition</b> parties, it was banned from July 1993 to August 1999.|$|R
50|$|Mahmadruzi Iskandarov (Маҳмадрузи Искандаров, محمدروز اسکندراف; born 3 May 1954) is a <b>Tajik</b> <b>opposition</b> {{politician}} {{and the chairman}} of the Democratic Party of Tajikistan. Arrested in 2005, he is currently serving a 23-year prison term. As Iskandarov is serving his jail sentence, Masud Sobirov has taken leadership of the Democratic Party.|$|R
50|$|Evading arrest, Yuldashev and Namagani fled to Tajikistan, where {{civil war}} was raging {{following}} a bloody but successful coup led by Emomali Rahmonov earlier in 1992. The civil war pitted Rahmonov's neo-communist forces against a loose coalition of democrats and Islamists known as <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition</b> (UTO). The UTO {{was led by}} the widely popular and highly respected Islamist Said Abdullah Nuri, whose Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan (IRPT) advocated a moderate and democratic brand of Islamism.|$|E
50|$|In the {{preamble}} of the resolution, the Council noted that significant progress {{had been made}} in the peace progress in Tajikistan. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition</b> (UTO) said it would disband its units and the Supreme Court had lifted restrictions and a ban on the political parties of the UTO. It acknowledged that presidential elections had taken place on 6 November 1999. The security situation had remained calm {{in most parts of the}} country though some areas remained tense.|$|E
50|$|In Tajikistan, {{the civil}} war began after local OMON began defecting to anti-Nabiyev protesters in May 1992. The country's {{minority}} Pamiri people largely backed <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Tajik</b> <b>Opposition,</b> {{and for that reason}} were targeted for massacres by pro-government forces during the bloody first phase of the war in 1992-1993. A significant portion of the Tajikistan MVD's command structure and its OMON consisted mainly of Pamiris who were then either killed or forced to flee to Gorno-Badakhshan.|$|E
50|$|Islam {{also played}} a key {{political}} role for the regime in power in the early 1990s. The communist old guard evoked domestic and international fears that fundamentalist Muslims would destabilize the Tajikistani government when that message was expedient in fortifying the hard-liners' position against opposition forces in the civil war. However, the Nabiyev regime also was willing to represent itself as an ally of Iran's Islamic republic while depicting the <b>Tajik</b> <b>opposition</b> as unfaithful Muslims.|$|R
5000|$|From 1999 onwards {{a process}} was set into motion by Ahmad Shah Massoud and Haq to <b>unite</b> <b>the</b> ethnicities of Afghanistan against the Taliban regime. Massoud <b>united</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tajiks,</b> Hazara and Uzbeks {{as well as}} several Pashtun commanders. Besides meeting with Pashtun tribal leaders and acting as a point of reference, Haq {{received}} increasing numbers of Pashtun Taliban themselves who were secretly approaching him. Some commanders which had worked for the Taliban military apparatus agreed to the plan to topple the Taliban regime as the Taliban lost support even among the Pashtuns. Senior diplomat and Afghanistan expert Peter Tomsen hoped that [...] "the ‘Lion of Kabul’ Haq and the ‘Lion of Panjshir’ Shah Massoud would make a formidable anti-Taliban team if they combined forces. Haq, Massoud, and Karzai, Afghanistan's three leading moderates, could transcend the Pashtun—non-Pashtun, north-south divide." [...] The senior Hazara and Uzbek leaders took part in the process just like later Afghan president Hamid Karzai. They agreed to work under the banner of exiled Afghan King, Zahir Shah, who was residing in Rome, Italy.|$|R
5000|$|From 1999 onwards, {{a renewed}} process was set into motion by the Tajik Ahmad Shah Massoud and the Pashtun Abdul Haq to <b>unite</b> all <b>the</b> ethnicities of Afghanistan. Massoud <b>united</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tajiks,</b> Hazara and Uzbeks {{as well as}} several Pashtun commanders under his United Front.

[...] Steve Coll referred to this plan as a [...] "grand Pashtun-Tajik alliance". The senior Hazara and Uzbek leaders took part in the process just like later Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
