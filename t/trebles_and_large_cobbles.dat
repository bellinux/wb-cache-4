50|$|The {{surface of}} the bank partly {{consists}} of gravel <b>and</b> <b>larger</b> <b>cobbles.</b> Due to the relatively great depth of the Cleaver Bank, the soil is only seldom, in very heavy weather, moved by wave action. Because the gravel is relatively poor in silt and the transparency is great, there is enough light enough {{to allow for the}} growth of calcareous red algae. The benthic fauna on the bank contains species that live on a hard substrate, such as sea anemones and polyps. Rare species living on Cleaver Bank are Thracia convexa and the Rayed artemis. The bank is used by herring for spawning. In addition, the soft coral type dead man's finger is found here.|$|R
5000|$|During {{reconstruction}} (see below) limited excavations {{were conducted}} at Newtown Castle. The {{results indicated that}} the castle may be late 16th or early 17th century, rather than mid-16th century. Signs of the presence of a significant population (animal and shellfish remains <b>and</b> a <b>large</b> <b>cobbled</b> space) were also discovered in the area. This gave rise to speculation whether the name [...] "Newtown" [...] may actually have referred to a new settlement near the castle.|$|R
50|$|Various {{attempts}} have been made to refine the Udden-Wentworth scale, including its definition of cobbles. In 1968, D. J. Doeglas proposed subdividing the cobble designation into two fractions, small cobbles (for particles with diameters from 64 - 125 mm) <b>and</b> <b>large</b> <b>cobbles</b> (for particles with diameters from 125 - 250 mm). A 1999 paper by Terence C. Blair and John G. McPherson argued that the Udden-Wentworth and Krumbein scales betrayed a historical emphasis on the study of sand grains while ignoring larger gravel grains. They proposed defining fine cobbles as those with diameters from 64 - 128 mm (−6 to −7 φ) and coarse cobbles as those with diameters from 128 - 256 mm (−7 to −8 φ). In 2012, Simon J. Blott and Kenneth Pye suggested that the cobble designation be eliminated altogether, replaced by very small boulder and small boulder designations equivalent in size to Blair and McPherson's fine and coarse cobbles, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Prime {{spawning}} {{habitat for}} the blacktail shiner is in fractional crevices; generally located in flowing water, preferring crevices in current velocities of 0.30 m/s. Populations in reservoirs chose crevice sites in locations of much lower current speeds. [...] In the Blanco River, Texas, blacktail shiners were observed depositing eggs underneath small boulders <b>and</b> <b>large</b> <b>cobble</b> in a bedrock riffle in the swiftest current velocities available. Males respond to sounds produced by spawning females {{and are able}} to distinguish these sounds from those produced by related female red shiners. Males are territorial, defending a crevice from other males. Breeding pair swims along the crevice, the female deposits eggs; usually the sperm has already been released into the crevice, so the eggs are deposited into a crevice with viable sperm. Immediately after spawning, the male doubles back and eats any eggs that failed to make it into the crevice. Small males (sneakers) try to fertilize eggs by darting between the dominant male and spawning female. Both <b>large</b> <b>and</b> small males will enter another male's territory and deposit sperm in a crevice before the male courts a female to lay eggs in the crevice.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of crayfish in aquatic systems there are major issues threatening their conservation, including invasive species, habitat alterations, and species with small distributions or have limited geographical ranges. There is limited information regarding native range, habitat requirements, life histories and biological interactions between crayfish species. In order {{to examine the relationship}} between lotic crayfish assemblages and environmental variables at both the watershed and reach scales, data were collected from 46 stream segments in the Upper Green River Basin of Kentucky, U. S. A. An independent sample t-test compared crayfish densities between segments with gravel - small <b>cobble,</b> <b>and</b> <b>large</b> <b>cobble</b> - small boulder substrates and revealed non-significant differences for both all <b>and</b> <b>large</b> (3 ̆e 15 mm) carapace length individuals. Correspondence analyses were conducted separately for gravel-cobble and cobble-small boulder segments <b>and</b> <b>large</b> boulder segments <b>and</b> some species showed strong associations with each other. In the gravel-cobble/cobble-small boulder segments a series of one-way ANOVA 2 ̆ 7 s showed significant effects of sub-basin location on both crayfish density and species richness whereas in the large boulder segment there were no significant differences. An exploratory canonical correspondence analysis in the forward selection procedure was performed to reduce the number of environmental variables in the gravel-cobble/cobble-small boulder segments <b>and</b> <b>large</b> boulder segments. The second CCA performed between crayfish species and environmental variables showed relationships with several environmental variables in the gravel-cobble/cobble-small boulder segments. Significant variables elucidated were summer mean temperature, depth, and total phosphate. The second CCA in the large boulder segment, however, failed to find strong relationships between the crayfish and environmental variables. Further testing using multiple linear regression stepwise forward selection analysis demonstrated that crayfish were responding to total phosphorous,...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The {{rainbow trout}} {{population}} in Elder Creek, Oregon was studied between June 1965 and November 1966. The physical {{characteristics of the}} stream during the summer season were described. Rainbow trout were captured in each of three sections on the stream by electrofishing and were tagged and measured. Population size, mortality, recruitment, growth rate, and production was estimated for fish in each section where data were sufficient. Estimates were made of the yield of trout to the sport fishery. The water in Elder Creek is relatively low in concentration of dissolved solids. The stream lies in a canyon of mostly bedrock <b>and</b> <b>large</b> <b>cobbles</b> with very little spawning gravel. Water temperature {{was found to be}} near the maximum for trout suitability in the lower reaches of the stream. Reliable estimates of population size and their variation were obtained within the summer of 1966. Population size estimates for the summer of 1965 were not reliable because of the small numbers of trout that could be obtained during this period. Therefore estimates of annual rates of mortality, growth, and production were not possible, Growth rates were estimated for marked and for unmarked fish during the summer of 1966. Marked fish were found to have a markedly lower growth than unmarked fish. Of 755 observations of trout movement during the study less than four percent were found to have moved more than 300 feet. Immigration of adult fish into the population was either insignificant or not detectable. Although Elder Creek has a good population of legal-sized native trout, fishing pressure on the stream is relatively light. The lower reaches are fished more heavily than the headwaters, which probably receive no angling pressure during some fishing seasons...|$|R

40|$|Oncorhynchus rastrosus {{was a very}} large, spike-toothed, Pacific Salmon {{from the}} mid-Miocene to early Pliocene of the Pacific Northwest (California to Washington). It had two large premaxillary (breeding-fighting) teeth that stuck out {{laterally}} from the snout like spikes. It migrated from the Pacific Ocean to inland rivers to spawn, as extant Pacific salmon do today. It was planktivorous, based on numerous, long, over-lapping gill-rakers, and few, small teeth. There are gaps in our knowledge about this interesting salmon. First, one of the localities {{where many of the}} paratype specimens were collected (Turlock Lake, California), was not described geologically in the original paper beyond, ‘from the Mehrten Formation’. Here we describe these deposits as cross-bedded sands, gravels <b>and</b> <b>large,</b> rounded <b>cobbles</b> indicative of a fast-flowing, river, which we coin here as the “proto-Tuolumne River,” that periodically overflowed its banks. Paleocurrent directions indicate the river flowed to the southwest, where it joined the San Joaquin River in the Central Valley and flowed southward at this time (~ 5 Ma), emptying into a marine embayment near Bakersfield. Thus, the Turlock Lake O. rastrosus specimens would have migrated up from this embayment. Second, we investigated whether O. rastrosus developmentally changed before migration upriver to spawn, as extant Pacific salmon do today, by comparing premaxillary teeth from freshwater and coastal marine deposits in California. We found that the largest teeth (with the largest osseous tooth bases) were from freshwater deposits, and that these specimens had the most worn and blunt tooth tips. We propose that this was due to use in territorial defense during spawning and redd (nesting site) construction...|$|R
