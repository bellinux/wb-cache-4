50|$|In law, {{special rules}} apply to {{rebuttal}}; rebuttal evidence or rebuttal witnesses must be confined {{solely to the}} subject matter of the <b>evidence</b> <b>rebutted.</b> New <b>evidence</b> on other subjects may not be brought in rebuttal. However, rebuttal is one of the few vehicles whereby a party may introduce surprise evidence or witnesses. The basic process is as follows: both sides of a controversy are obliged to declare in advance of trial what witnesses they plan to call, and what each witness is expected to testify to. When either a plaintiff (or prosecutor) or defendant brings direct evidence or testimony which was not anticipated, the other side may be granted a specific opportunity <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> it. In rebuttal, the rebutting party may generally bring witnesses and evidence which were never before declared, so long as they serve <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> the prior <b>evidence.</b>|$|R
50|$|As in Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), the Court {{ruled that}} when a refugee {{establishes}} a prima facie case that deportation may lead to torture, {{they are entitled to}} a higher degree of procedural protections than the Immigration Act stipulates. In particular, the appellant has a right to know the full case against him, and to be given a full opportunity to respond in writing. The appellant must be given the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> claims and <b>evidence</b> and to produce their own evidence. Finally, the appellant has the right to receive written reasons for a decision of the Minister.|$|R
50|$|Evidentiary {{standards}} are codified by the Evidence Act of 2005. The Act includes many modern, liberal English common law provisions including {{the exclusion of}} evidence that is unfairly prejudicial, exclusion of evidence of attempts to settle outside court, and exclusion of evidence of subsequent remedial measures. The Act, however, does not guarantee parties before a court to confront the witnesses against them when the court believes the witness' identity needs to be protected. Physical evidence on an issue renders documentary evidence on the same issue inadmissible unless the court finds there is substantive and reasonable ground for the physical evidence to be untrue and irrelevant. Thus, judges retain {{a high level of}} discretion in the admission of evidence in all cases and the ability <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> witness <b>evidence</b> in certain others. Witnesses may be impeached by prior inconsistent statements or by evidence of prior bad acts involving dishonesty or fraud. There are also provisions protecting witnesses and victims of sexual crimes which render evidence about the witness or victim's sexual behavior inadmissible in most situations. Hearsay (including non-hearsay and hearsay exceptions), party admissions, burdens, and presumptions are also codified in a fashion similar to the United States Federal Rules of Evidence.|$|R

[...] "To appropriate," [...] he says, [...] "to my own use the sums which I have already passed to your credit, by the unworthy and, pardon me, if I add, dangerous, {{reflections}} which you have passed upon me for the first communication of this kind." [...] They passed no reflections: they said they would neither praise nor blame him, but pressed him for an account of a matter which they could not understand: and I believe your Lordships understand it no more than they, for it is not in the compass of human understanding to conceive or comprehend it. Instead of an account of it, he dares to threaten them: [...] "I may be tempted, if you should provoke me, not to be an honest man,--to falsify your account a second time, and to reclaim those sums which I have passed to your credit,--to alter the account again, by the assistance of Mr. Larkins." [...] What a dreadful declaration is this of his dominion over the public accounts, and of his power of altering them! a declaration, that, having first falsified those accounts in order to deceive them, and afterwards having told them of this falsification in order to gain credit with them, if they provoke him, he shall take back the money he had carried to their account, and make them his debtors for it! He fairly avows the dominion he has over the Company's accounts; and therefore, when he shall hereafter plead the accounts, we shall be able <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> that <b>evidence,</b> and say, [...] "The Company's accounts are corrupted by you, through your agent, Mr. Larkins; and we give no credit to them, because you not only told the Company you could do so, but we can prove that you have actually done it." [...] What a strange medley of evasion, pretended discovery, real concealment, fraud, and prevarication appears in every part of this letter! ...|$|R

40|$|Since the Supreme Court’s {{landmark}} 1963 {{decision in}} Philadelphia National Bank, antitrust challengers have mounted prima facie cases against horizontal mergers that {{rested on the}} level and increase in market concentration caused by the merger, with proponents of the merger then permitted <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> by providing <b>evidence</b> that the merger {{will not have the}} feared anticompetitive effects. Although the way that concentration is measured and the triggering levels have changed over the last half century, the basic approach has remained intact. This longstanding structural presumption, which is well supported by economic theory and evidence, has been critical to effective merger enforcement. We suggest some ways to strengthen it further. One critical assumption in this burden shifting framework is that the goal of merger policy is to protect consumers against high prices or reduced output, product variety, product quality, or innovation (“consumer welfare”). If the goal is something else, such as deterring industrial concentration to control corporate political power, or protecting small firms from larger competitors, then the structural presumption must be viewed differently. The bulk of this essay examines and defends the role of structural presumptions in the present legal world where protection of consumer welfare is the point of merger enforcement. We also briefly consider a legislative proposal that could be seen as departing from this norm, offering some guidance concerning how this proposal could be improved so as to strengthen merger enforcement, in part by making it easier for the government to establish its prima facie case...|$|R
