40|$|Dispersions {{of single}} walled {{nanotubes}} in N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone {{have been exposed}} to water and variations in storage temperature. The subsequent degradation of dispersion quality has been monitored using sedimentation, UV-vis-NIR, and AFM measurements. Four parameters derived from AFM; the root-mean-square bundle diameter, the total number of dispersed objects (individuals and bundles) per unit volume of dispersion, the number fraction of individual nanotubes, and the number of individual nanotubes per unit volume of dispersion were used to quantitatively characterize the dispersion quality as a function of water content and storage temperature. In addition the positions of the nanotube absorption peaks were used to <b>track</b> <b>dispersion</b> quality, with redshifts taken as an indication of aggregation. It was found that water can rapidly shift the dispersion to a new but more aggregated equilibrium state. In particular the population of individual nanotubes falls to zero for relatively low amounts of added water. The dispersion quality decreases with increasing water content, reaching a plateau for all metrics by 20 vol % added water. In addition, it was also identified that low temperature treatment, i. e. - 16,- 18,- 20, and- 22 °C (all above th...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a simplified model (Rapid Aviation Noise Evaluator – RANE) for {{the calculation of}} aviation noise {{within the context of}} multi-disciplinary strategic environmental assessment where input data is both limited and constrained by compatibility requirements against other disciplines. RANE relies upon the concept of noise cylinders around defined flight-tracks with the Noise Radius determined from publicly available Noise-Power-Distance curves rather than the computationally intensive multiple point-to-point grid calculation with subsequent ISOcontour interpolation methods adopted in the FAA’s Integrated Noise Model (INM) and similar models. Preliminary results indicate that for simple single runway scenarios, changes in airport noise contour areas can be estimated with minimal uncertainty compared against grid-point calculation methods such as INM. In situations where such outputs are all that is required for preliminary strategic environmental assessment, there are considerable benefits in reduced input data and computation requirements. Further development of the noise-cylinder-based model (such as the incorporation of lateral attenuation, engine-installation-effects or horizontal <b>track</b> <b>dispersion</b> via the assumption of more complex noise surfaces formed around the flight-track) will allow for more complex assessment to be carried out. RANE is intended to be incorporated into technology evaluators for the noise impact assessment of novel aircraft concepts...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a new technique}} that enables visualization of the breakup and <b>tracking</b> of the <b>dispersion</b> of a fuel spray in the near-field of the nozzle {{by means of a}} phosphorescent tracer. It exclusively visualizes the liquid phase, without interference of the vapor phase. The phosphorescence properties of the dissolved Eu-TTA-TOPO complex are compared for different solutions, including engine-relevant surrogate fuels. A method of internal nozzle excitation is presented, which, when applied to water and heptane-based solutions shows the breakup regime, ligament development, and droplet separation. Laser sheet excitation immediately downstream of the nozzle exit is shown to enable the <b>tracking</b> of <b>dispersion</b> and the determination of the fluid velocity of the tagged fluid volume. The results show an increase in both radial and longitudinal width of the fluid parcels with the distance from the nozzle exit for both the water and heptane solution, depending on the properties of the fluid and its velocity. A variation between the breakup of individual fluid parcels was observed and characterized by <b>tracking</b> <b>dispersion</b> on each breakup sequence.

The intensity of currents as well as the complexity of topography and tides around the Cap de La Hague {{in the center of the}} English Channel makes it one of the most difficult areas to represent in terms of hydrodynamics and dispersion. Controlled releases of tritium - in the form of HTO - are carried out in this area by the AREVA-NC plant, providing an excellent soluble tracer. A total of 14 493 measurements were acquired to <b>track</b> <b>dispersion</b> in the hours and days following a release. These data, supplementing previously gathered data and physical measurements (bathymetry, water-surface levels, Eulerian and Lagrangian current studies) allow us to test dispersion models from the hour following release to periods of several years which are not accessible with dye experiments. The dispersion characteristics are described and methods are proposed for comparing models against measurements. An application is proposed for a 2 dimensions high-resolution numerical model. It shows how an extensive dataset can be used to build, calibrate and validate several aspects of the model in a highly dynamic and macrotidal area: tidal cycle timing, tidal amplitude, fixed-point current data, hodographs. This study presents results concerning the model's ability to reproduce residual Lagrangian currents, along with a comparison between simulation and high-frequency measurements of tracer dispersion.

An updated static and dynamic model forecast an injected gas transit time of between 4 and 8 months between CRC- 1 injection and Naylor- 1 observation wells. Injection began on March 18 th 2008 and was halted on August 29 th 2009 with 65, 445 tonnes of CO 2 mixed gas stored.

40|$|The project {{concerned}} {{the development of}} a novel measurement and analysis tool, designed to aid the study of cure in thermosetting polymers. Cure is the irreversible process whereby an initially liquid (unreacted) resin turns into a rubbery solid and eventually into a rigid crosslinked glass. The process usually requires the application of heat to proceed to completion. The changes in structure are reflected in changing mobilities of electrically charged species in the resin and dielectric signals can therefore be used to monitor the progress of cure. In this project, the normal heating–up of the resin was accompanied by a superimposed sinusoidal temperature variation of +/- 1 °C. Deconvolution of the resulting dielectric signal into its reversible and irreversible components made it possible to distinguish between the signal contributions arising from the temperature change alone and from those directly contributable to the irreversible chemical chain extension and crosslinking. This proves the original hypothesis put forward in the proposal. The new ideas generated {{during the course of the}} project enabled us to obtain significant follow-on funding from the EPSRC.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Precise {{measurement}} of the QT interval is often hampered by difficulty determining {{the end of the}} low amplitude T wave. Root mean square electrocardiography (RMS ECG) provides a novel alternative measure of ventricular repolarization. Experimental data have shown that the interval between the RMS ECG QRS and T wave peaks (RTPK) closely reflects the mean ventricular action potential duration while the RMS T wave width (TW) <b>tracks</b> the <b>dispersion</b> of repolarization timing. Here, we tested the precision of RMS ECG to assess ventricular repolarization in humans in the setting of drug-induced and congenital Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). METHODS: RMS ECG signals were derived from high-resolution 24 hour Holter monitor recordings from 68 subjects after receiving placebo and moxifloxacin and from standard 12 lead ECGs obtained in 97 subjects with LQTS and 97 age- and sex-matched controls. RTPK, QTRMS and RMS TW intervals were automatically measured using custom software and compared to traditional QT measures using lead II. RESULTS: All measures of repolarization were prolonged during moxifloxacin administration and in LQTS subjects, but the variance of RMS intervals was significantly smaller than traditional lead II measurements. TW was prolonged during moxifloxacin and in subjects with LQT- 2, but not LQT- 1 or LQT- 3. CONCLUSION: These data validate the application of RMS ECG for the detection of drug-induced and congenital LQTS. RMS ECG measurements are more precise than the current standard of care lead II measurements...|$|R

In contact with aqueous solution clay minerals show cation - exchange properties and certain degree of dissolution or rather selective leaching of components. The work is divided into two main parts - determination of zeta potential and particle size distribution. The first part is focused on measuring of zeta potential. Effects of concentration of solid, different kind of electrolytes (0. 01 M KCl, 0. 01 M MgCl 2 and 0. 01 M CaCl 2), pH and temperature of the dispersions are investigated. The isoelectric points (IEP) of kaolin suspension are about pH 4 - 5. Electrolytes containing monovalent cations such as K+ become zeta potential more negative compared to the values obtained with water. Such behavior is explained by the exchange of K+ ions with H+ ions in the system.

Over expression of the BB 2 receptor offers an appealing target for the design of targeted radiopharmaceuticals.   The Hoffman laboratory and others have been involved, for over a decade, in synthesizing Bombesin analogues that target the BB 2 receptor for the purpose of developing a viable radiopharmaceutical for diagnostic or therapeutic treatment of cancer. Radiopharmaceuticals based on Bombesin analogues are typically composed of a targeting vector, radioisotope, chelator and linking group [See Bifunctional Conjugate Design figure below]. Previous studies have shown that variations in linking groups may affect the retention time of the bifunctional conjugate in prostate cancer (PC- 3) cells.   Higher retention time allows for more efficacious therapeutic benefits and enhanced diagnostic imaging capabilities.   In the work presented, we designed and synthesized a 111 In-Bombesin analogue with a phenyl linker group in order to determine if the phenyl linker group would provide higher retention times in prostate cancer.   In-vitro analysis of the radiopharmaceutical was performed using PC- 3 cells to determine the affinity of the new compound for the BB 2 receptor to be 1. 09 nM. In-vivo studies of the radiopharmaceutical were also conducted by injection of the radiopharmaceutical into CF- 1 (“normal”) mice, as well as SCID (Severe Combined Immunodeficient) mice bearing 2 - 3 week old PC- 3 tumors.

In order to understand these changes in noise, and to design procedures that could help mitigate any negative effects, {{it is important to have}} modeling tools capable of capturing the noise impacts of flight track variability. This thesis develops a model for this purpose. First, twenty days of radar flight trajectory data from 2015 and 2016 at Boston Logan International Airport (KBOS) is used to quantify the observed distributions of variability in speed, altitude, and lateral track position. It is shown that altitude and speed variability have relatively small impacts on noise, but that the impacts of observed lateral variability are significant. Using this information, a physics-based model is developed to capture the noise impacts of lateral flight track variability. This tool is then used to model several example scenarios. First, the changes in noise due to pre- and post-PBN procedures are examined for KBOS Runway 33 L departures. Next, a hypothetical procedure is designed to intentionally introduce lateral dispersion to KBOS Runway 33 L departures. Finally, the tool is used to rapidly model noise impacts on due to both arrival and departure operations on all runways at KBOS. The model is shown to reduce computational expense by 1 - 2 order of magnitude relative to traditional methods. The results of these example analyses show that increased lateral dispersion causes a significant noise reduction at higher noise levels directly below the flight track at the cost of wider contours at lower noise levels. Because of this, any decision to add or remove flight <b>track</b> lateral <b>dispersion</b> has highly localized impacts that depend on the geometry of the route and the population of the surrounding area, and thus must be closely analyzed on an individual basis.

40|$|This review recaps {{significant}} results as {{they apply to}} non-dwarf galaxies, including the Milky Way, spiral disks and bulges, and elliptical and lenticular galaxies. Conclusions that span the galaxy types treated here are as follows. All galaxies, on average, have heavy element abundances (metallicities) that systematically decrease outward from their galactic centers while their global metallicities increase with galaxy mass. Abundance gradients are steepest in normal spirals and are seen to be progressively flatter going in order from barred spirals, lenticulars, and ellipticals. For spiral galaxies, local metallicity appears to be correlated with total (disk plus bulge) surface density. Observed abundance patterns indicate that N production is dominated by primary processes at low metallicity and secondary processes at high metallicity; C production increases with increasing metallicity; and O, Ne, S, and Ar are produced in lockstep independent of metallicity. In elliptical galaxies, nuclear abundances {{are in the range}} [Z/H] = 0. 0 to 0. 4, but the element mixture is not scaled-solar. In large elliptical galaxies [Mg/Fe] is in the range 0. 3 to 0. 5, decreasing to ~ 0 in smaller elliptical galaxies. Other light elements track the Mg enhancement, but the heavier Ca <b>tracks</b> Fe. Velocity <b>dispersion</b> appears to be a key parameter in the modulation of [Mg/Fe], but the cause of the connection is unclear. Comment: 55 -page manuscript plus 16 figures.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the dispersion characteristics of polydispersed droplets in a general hospital ward equipped with ceiling-mixing type ventilation system. Injections of water test droplets containing non-volatile content were produced. The injections simulate human coughs with a similar droplet size distribution (peak size at 12 mu m) and airflow rate (0. 4 L/s). The dispersion of test droplets was measured in-situ by interferometric Mie imaging (IMI) method combined with an aerosol spectrometer. A multiphase numerical model was employed to simulate the droplet <b>dispersion</b> <b>tracks</b> to provide additional transient position tracking data. Results show that the small size group of droplets or droplet nuclei (initial size <= 45 mu m) behaved airborne transmittable as some nuclei stayed airborne for more than 360 s. The dispersions were strongly affected by the ventilation airflow pattern. The expiratory droplets exhibited a two-stage lateral dispersion behavior, in which rapid dispersion {{was found in the}} early "initial dispersion" stage and then the dispersion became much slower in the subsequent "stable" stage. The exhaust air vents significantly enhanced lateral dispersions towards their direction. Droplets in the large size group (initial size = 87. 5 mu m and 137. 5 mu m) were subjected to heavy gravitational effect and stayed airborne for less than 30 s. Results indicate that the location of exhaust air vents has significant impact on the dispersion pattern of expiratory droplets. It should be carefully considered in designing ventilation systems for health-care settings. Copyright © American Association for Aerosol Research...|$|R
40|$|Clouds have pivotal {{influence}} on the Earth's hydrological cycle and climate system because they are intricately involved in the dynamical, chemical, and radiative processes within the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Cirrus clouds occur at high altitude around the tropopause level and, despite their thin appearance and low optical thickness, they contribute to the radiative balance of the atmosphere. The processes in this region of the atmosphere have become increasingly important for {{a clear understanding of}} feedback mechanisms in the climate system. The Canadian designed and built Optical Spectrograph and Infrared Imaging System (OSIRIS) satellite instrument measures the spectrum of sunlight scattered from the Earth's atmosphere at wavelengths from the ultraviolet (280 nm) to the near infrared (810 nm). The limb scattering measurement technique allows OSIRIS to collect information on the vertical profile of atmospheric chemical and particle composition at a resolution of approximately 2 km with nearly global daily coverage. In this work, a technique characterizing the distribution of cirrus cloud top occurrences from OSIRIS limb scattering radiance profiles is presented. The technique involves computing residual profiles by comparing normalized measured radiance and modelled molecular density profiles where mismatches between the two traces indicate the presence of clouds. Probability density functions of scattering residuals show the distribution is not a continuum measurement; there is a clear distinction between the cloudy and cloud-free conditions. Observations show high cloud top occurrences in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere region above Indonesia and Central America. Results obtained using the high altitude cloud detection technique and OSIRIS measurements are compared to those by Sassen et al. (2008) who used CALIPSO nadir measurements and to those by Wang et al. (1996) who used SAGE II solar occultation measurements of cirrus clouds. The cloud detection technique is applied to three case studies. Cloud top detections are used to support results presented in Dessler (2009) who theorized the local relative humidity controls either dehydration or hydration of the lower stratosphere through the efficiency of evaporation of ice lofted by deep convection. The second study makes use of the cloud detection technique to eliminate cloud-containing scans as to identify an Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer in support of Vernier et al. (2011). Finally, the technique is used to <b>track</b> the <b>dispersion</b> and evolution of the volcanic plume following the Sarychev eruption in June 2009 since monitoring volcanic plumes is an effective way to help mitigate aviation hazards...|$|R
40|$|Tidal {{flow past}} an {{idealized}} triangular headland was investigated using an explicit finite difference solver for the equations of shallow water flow. Flow separation and transient eddies developed downstream {{from the tip}} of the headland on each successive half tidal cycle. Details of the flow patterns were studied using Lagrangian particle <b>tracks.</b> Mixing and <b>dispersion</b> diagrams were created that showed the effect of the eddies on sets of colour-coded particles. These revealed both the inter-mixing of water masses originally located {{on each side of the}} headland and the straining of discrete volumes of water originating from locations seaward of the headland tip. The pattern of Eulerian tidal residuals was contrasted with the pattern of Lagrangian tidal residuals. The patterns were found to be very different from one another; the Lagrangian residuals revealed complex detail with some systematic features. It is only the Lagrangian residuals that can be used to make valid inferences about the mixing of dissolved or suspended material when the length-scale of the tidal excursion is similar to the size of the headland and of the eddies. In such cases, the use of the Eulerian residuals is invalid. The mixing rates were also quantified by evaluating the effective diffusion coefficient for the eddy system. Four distinct stages of development of dispersion were identified and elucidated by the use of mixing diagrams. The impact of transient eddies was shown to be confined to a distinct mixing zone within which high rates of strain and diffusion were observed...|$|R
