5|$|A {{painting}} of the band by John Byrne was at an earlier point under consideration {{to be used as}} the album's cover.

5|$|During the 2011 Rugby World Cup the All Blacks had an {{embroidered}} William Webb Ellis cup on <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> their jerseys {{with the}} year '1987' underneath.

5|$|The credits {{printed on}} <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> the first release were largely {{incomplete}} {{and made no}} distinction between the recording sessions of 1982-84 and those of 1987-88, apparently validating the false assumption that the original line-up of Blue Öyster Cult had reunited for {{the making of the}} album. Aside from the list of band members, the credits reported only some session musicians {{and other members of the}} so-called Guitar Orchestra of the State of Imaginos, and omitted other personnel who had contributed to Imaginos.|$|E
5|$|The crest was {{modified}} in 1995 after consultation with a Supporters Forum, with the turrets of the Wolsey Gate {{moved to the}} top of the crest, the yellow background changed to red, the Suffolk Punch given a more dominant physique and the F.C. expanded to Football Club. Three stars were added to <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> the team's away shirt for the 2004–05 season, and also to the home kit for the 2005–06 season. These stars were added to represent the three major trophies which Ipswich Town have won; the FA Cup, the UEFA Cup and the old Division One. The stars were relocated directly above the crest when the shirt was redesigned prior to the 2007–08 season.|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed tightly {{as if in}} prayer, and {{positioned}} so low in the painting as {{to appear to be}} resting on the frame. They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. <b>The</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E

5|$|Zappa's {{interest}} in composing and arranging flourished {{in his last}} high-school years. By his final year, he was writing, arranging and conducting avant-garde performance pieces for the school orchestra. He graduated from Antelope Valley High School in 1958, and later acknowledged two of his music teachers on <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> the 1966 album Freak Out! Due to his family's frequent moves, Zappa attended at least six different high schools, and as a student he was often bored and given to distracting {{the rest of the}} class with juvenile antics. In 1959, he attended Chaffey College but left after one semester, and maintained thereafter a disdain for formal education, taking his children out of school at age 15 and refusing to pay for their college.|$|E

25|$|Cats {{have been}} venerated in the Near East since antiquity, a {{tradition}} adopted by Islam, albeit {{in a much}} modified form. According to many hadiths, Mohammad prohibited the persecution and killing of cats. Muhammad purportedly allowed a cat to give birth on his cloak, and cut off <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> his prayer robe rather than wake his favourite cat, a female named Muezza, who was sleeping on it.|$|E
25|$|Band manager Chris Fenwick organises {{an annual}} walk around Canvey to commemorate Brilleaux's life, {{as well as}} {{additional}} walking tours during which he points out landmarks from the band's career. These include the jetty featured in the photograph on the band's first album cover, and venues where they played early in their career, such as The Lobster Smack inn, The Monico Nightclub and The Canvey Club (disguised as 'The Alibi Club' on <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> the album Sneakin' Suspicion).|$|E
25|$|Roxy Music reunited during 1978 {{to record}} a new album, Manifesto, but with a reshuffled cast. Jobson was not present, and was {{reportedly}} not contacted for the reunion. (At that time, Jobson was touring and recording with his own band, UK.) <b>The</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> Manifesto indicated that the revived Roxy Music line-up consisted of Ferry, Manzanera, Mackay, and Thompson, along with Paul Carrack (keyboards), Alan Spenner (bass), and Gary Tibbs (bass); despite this all other media pointed to Roxy Music being a quartet (and a trio following the 1980 departure of Thompson), with the latter three musicians being regular collaborators of the band.|$|E

25|$|Especially in Roman mosaics, {{but also}} in some German {{imperial}} commissions, for example on the Lothair Cross, the hand is clenched around a wreath that goes upwards, and behind which the arm then disappears, forming a tidy circular motif. Especially in these examples, the hand may show <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> a garment, sometimes of two layers, as at San Clemente, Rome. In blessing forms the hand often has a halo, which also may provide a convenient termination point. This {{may or may not}} be a cruciform halo, indicating the divinity, and specifically the Logos, or Pre-existing Christ (see below).|$|E
25|$|Where the {{majority}} of British police forces have silver-coloured badges, those of the City Police are black and gold featuring the City crest. The force has unique red and white chequered cap bands and red and white striped duty arm bands on <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> the tunics of constables and sergeants (red and white being the colours of the City), which in most other British police forces are black and white. City police sergeants and constables wear crested helmets whilst on foot patrol. These helmets do not feature either St Edward's Crown or the Brunswick Star, which are used on most other police helmets in England and Wales.|$|E
25|$|Up until 1997, {{uniforms and}} hats had distinctions {{according}} to their rank. For example, senior constable and sergeant ranks are plastic ranks on <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> the uniform. SDU, Marine Police, and the Counterterrorism Response Unit have their ranks {{at the back of}} the helmet or vest. Inspector to senior superintendent ranks have a insignia on the collar of the uniform. Superintendents also have a white stripe fitted on the police hat. Chief Superintendents and up have a white stripe on their hats, a slide with a silver vertical line on the collar of the uniform, a black baton, and a red whistle or a black and white whistle on the front right pocket.|$|E

25|$|All {{members of}} the family Sarcophagidae are larviparous or ovoviviparous. Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis (Bercaea cruentata) gives live birth to larvae with the female {{retaining}} the egg case in her abdomen. Flesh flies are strongly attracted to carrion or dry flesh. The female has a strong desire to lay larvae on the flesh and have even been noted to larviposit on <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> a garment that has been previously soiled with blood. Oldroyd states that the larvae of Sarcophaga spp are voracious and will take anything of animal origin be it alive or dead. A larva is forced out of the larvipositor usually head first and soon disappears into the food material. Once larvae are deposited as 1st stage instars, rapid development follows with 3rd instars usually being achieved by three to four days. Larviposition to adulthood generally takes around two weeks.|$|E
25|$|The Paris {{police force}} was {{completely}} re-organized {{after the fall}} of Napoleon III and the Commune; the sergents de ville were replaced by the gardiens de la paix publique (Guardians of the Public Peace), which by June 1871 had 7,756 men under the authority of the Prefect of Police named by the national government. Following a series of anarchist bombings in 1892, the number was increased to 7,000 guardians, 80 brigadiers and 950 sous-brigadiers. In 1901, under the prefect Louis Lépine, in order {{to keep up with the}} technology of the time, a unit of policemen on bicycles (called the hirondelles after the brand of the bicycles) was formed. They numbered 18 per arrondissement and reached 600 by 1906 for the whole city. A unit of river police, the brigade fluviale, was organized in 1900 for the Universal Exposition, as well as a unit of traffic police who wore a symbol of a Roman chariot embroidered on <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> their uniform. The first six motorcycle policemen appeared on the streets in 1906.|$|E
25|$|On 5 December 2005, South Korean {{electronics}} giant Samsung {{became the}} club's major sponsor in a two-year deal.

Prior to the 2006–07 season, KFC were announced as Victory's sleeve sponsor, with their logo appearing on <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> Victory's home and away kits. On 28 January 2009, Samsung announced {{that they would not be}} renewing their sponsorship for the 2009–10 A-League season. Intralot became the Melbourne Victory's new major sponsor when they signed a two-season $2 million contract on 4 May 2009. Their logo subsequently featured on the front of Melbourne Victory's playing strip, starting from the 2009–10 season. On 6 August 2010, it was announced that law firm Florin Burhala Lawyers would be Melbourne Victory's official shorts sponsor for the 2010–11 season. On 1 June 2011, it was announced that human resources company Adecco Group signed a three-year deal as the club's major sponsor, replacing Intralot. As part of the deal, Adecco's logo will appear on the front of the club's playing strip. Melbourne Victory announced on 16 June 2011 that they had signed a five-year deal with global sportswear giant Adidas as the club's official kit manufacturer.|$|E
