The implementation for rational values of Q becomes challenging and it can be shown that the role of these interpolation modules would lead to time-variant input-output responses of the polyphase network when conventional methods are used [14, 33, 34].

Possible solutions to these issues are discussed; including compatibility evaluation, changes to bio-fuels, regulatory changes, and changes in the distribution system or distribution practices. No actual experimental research has been conducted in the writing of this report, but results are used to develop recommendations for future research and additional study as appropriate.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} communication over a three user discrete memoryless interference channel ($ 3 -$IC). The current known coding techniques for communicating over an arbitrary $ 3 -$IC are based on message splitting, superposition coding and binning using independent and identically distributed (iid) random codebooks. In this work, we propose a new ensemble of codes - partitioned coset codes (PCC) - that possess an appropriate mix of empirical and algebraic closure properties. We develop coding techniques that exploit algebraic closure property of PCC to enable efficient communication over $ 3 -$IC. We analyze {{the performance of the}} proposed coding technique to derive an achievable rate region for the general discrete $ 3 -$IC. Additive and non-additive examples are identified for which the derived achievable rate region is the capacity, and moreover, strictly larger than current known largest achievable rate regions based on iid random codebooks. Comment: New examples for which coset codes yield strictly larger achievable rate regions in comparison to those achievable using unstructured iid codes are identified.

The charge packets are injected optically into the p-i-n sensing photodiode and confined at the illuminated regions changing locally the electrical field profile across the p-i-n switching diode. A red scanner is used for charge readout. The various design parameters and addressing architecture trade-offs are discussed. The influence on the transfer functions of an a-SiC:H sensing absorber optimized for red transmittance and blue collection or of a floating anode in between is analysed. Results show that the thin a-SiC:H sensing absorber confines the readout to the switching diode and filters the light allowing full colour detection at two appropriated voltages. When the floating anode is used the spectral response broadens, allowing B&W image recognition with improved light-to-dark sensitivity.
