50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>Committee</b> {{organized}} a national farm workers' conference in Stockholm on February 29, 1920. Apart from the 157 delegates of the constituent organizations {{there were also}} two delegates from Östergötland present. The national SLF leadership also reluctantly participated, in order to argue against the proposals of Sjölander. The conference proposed instituting a tripartite commission (consisting of SLF, ULF and the Forest and Farm Workers Union of Central Sweden) to oversee a merger of the different unions. The key debate at the conference was the issue of tactics. Sjölander's position prevailed (with 77 votes against 11), calling for the abolition of local bargaining agreements. The tripartite commission never became effective.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the contributory {{influence of the}} employee representative on the decision‐making process in <b>the</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>committee</b> of the Danish Red Cross Asylum Department. The empirical foundation is twofold; constituted by both participant observations and qualitative in‐depth interviews. By applying the organizational theoretical implications of the Bourdieuian Praxeology to this empirical foundation, it is shown, how some of the core notions of the theory – practice, habitus and symbolic violence – are pivotal in regards as to understanding both the possibilities, but mostly {{the conditions of the}} influence, that the employees can yield in <b>the</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>committee.</b> The practice analytical framework facilitates an approach to <b>the</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>committee,</b> which stresses the crucial significance of the structural setting that is the organization. By understanding the actual practice in <b>the</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>committee</b> as a correlation between structural restraints on agency on one hand – constituted by both the “cooperation committee‐agreement”, the symbolic power structures of the organization and the habitual dispositional agency – and the free strategic interplay of the particular agent on the other hand, it is grasped how the practice in <b>the</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>committee</b> is somewhat solidified. The established symbolic order which is profoundly embedded in practice and therefore also in the perception of the members of <b>the</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>committee,</b> has cemented itself, leaving the committee meetings in an absence of any real kind of decision‐making process. Thus explaining both why the meetings are focusing more on information, than on extending decisions to the employee part of the committee, and why the employees’ perception of contributory influence points more towards a matter of form than on substance or principles...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the involvement of}} the Danish Communist Party in <b>the</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>Committee</b> for Peace and Security (CCPS), a Danish peace organisation, in the years between the establishment of CCPS in 1974 to 1982 when a number of international events revealed communist dominance in CCPS. The main focus {{of this study is to}} investigate how the Communist Party influenced CCPS and to answer the question: What are the reasons behind the Communist involvement in CCPS? Based on new sources and archives, this study illustrates and concludes that the Danish Communist Party played a vital economic, organizational, and political role in CCPS from the very beginning – even though the visibility of the influence varied through the years. Furthermore, the Danish Communist Party realized that, even though they constituted the economic and organizational foundation in CCPS, they were not always able to control the politics of CCPS In February 1974, during the Cold War, the CCPS was established in an attempt to gather the Danish peace movement. As a social movement organisation CCPS mobilized around peace and disarmament in their attempts to influence the Danish Government and the public opinion. Therefore, the Danish Communist Party saw CCPS as a perfect mouthpiece for communist ideas and politics. Next to being one of the most important peace organisations in Denmark, especially regarding their campaigns against the neutron bomb in 1977, and the NATO double resolution in 1979, CCPS were also one of the most controversial cooperations. Journalists, politicians and the Danish Police Intelligence Service characterized CCPS as a soviet-controlled organisation – and this characterisation has been used ever since in the Cold War Research. Nevertheless, existing research is deficient in relation to documentation. Therefore, this thesis contains basic research, which constitutes a significant contribution to the understanding of how and why the Danish Communist Party engaged in CCPS...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study the role of information and communication technology (ICT) and information and communication technology for development (ICT 4 D) in Cambodian non-government organizations (NGOs). By focusing on a workshop on the ICT applications Unicode and Open Office, initiated by <b>the</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>Committee</b> for Cambodia (the CCC), I intend to see how these applications were adopted, how they are used and what the future is for ICT and ICT 4 D in Cambodia. The research is based on qualitative, semi structured interviews with employees at CCC as well as NGO workers who were participants at the workshops. The theories that I have used are Amartya Sen’s capability approach, Everett Rogers’ diffusion of innovation theory and intercultural communication. This study shows that ICT {{is considered to be a}} very important tool for the development of Cambodia. Unicode has contributed with an easier way to type and read documents in Khmer and it is considered to promote the Khmer language. Open Office have not found its renaissance yet since people find it difficult to use although the NGOs sees its’ potential and wants to learn it. According to the NGO workers, ICT and ICT 4 D will play an important role for the Cambodian development in the future but because of a lack of infrastructure and proper knowledge about the new technology, it has not been used to its full capacity. In order for us to understand how ICT can reach its full potential within NGOs, there have to exist an understanding of Cambodian culture and history since the Khmer people’s values affect how the NGO workers look at development and the tools they are using. ...|$|E
