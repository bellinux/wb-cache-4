5|$|A {{chelator}} for binding a radioisotope can be attached. Pendetide, {{a derivative}} of pentetic acid, {{is used for}} example in capromab pendetide to chelate indium-111. If the drug contains a radioisotope, <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the isotope precedes <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the antibody.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Ramcharitmanas, there is a section devoted to the veneration of <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Rama. As per Tulsidas, repeating <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Rama is the only means to attain God in the Kali age where the means suited for other ages like meditation, Karma, and Puja are ineffective. He says in Kavitavali that his own redemption is because of the power, glory and majesty of <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Rama. In a couplet in the Gitavali, Tulsidas says that wishing for liberation without refuge in <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Rama is like wishing to climb to the sky by holding on to the falling rain. In his view, <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Rama is greater than both Nirguna and Saguna aspects of God – it controls both of them and is illuminates both like a bilingual interpreter. In a verse in the Dohavali, Tulsidas says that the Nirguna Brahman resides in his heart, the Saguna Brahman resides in his eyes and <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Rama resides on his tongue, as if a radiant gemstone is kept between the lower and upper halves of a golden casket. He holds that Rama is superior to all other names of God, and argues that ra and ma being are the only two consonants that are written above all other consonants in the conjunct form in Sanskrit because they are the two sounds in the word Rama.|$|E
