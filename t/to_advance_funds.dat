40|$|Over {{the last}} five years, the idea that {{bankruptcy}} practice has trounced the scheme of the 1978 Bankruptcy Code (from now on “The Code”) has emerged. Pioneered by professors Baird and Rasmussen, a cluster of legal literature has developed around the changes in bankruptcy practice, the reasons behind those changes and possible efficiency implications of the professed novel occurrences. There are conflicting opinions over {{almost every aspect of}} the debate, but everyone seems to agree at least that actual bankruptcy practice has evolved from the depictions commonly made two decades ago. Technological changes and financial innovations 3 seem to be the triggering factor for the new developments. Financial contracting design has adopted a widespread use of agreement specific increasingly detailed covenants, which allowed writing contracts that depended upon the new monitoring technology. The financial strategist is now able to employ security interests in virtually all the debtor’s property, present and future, intertwined with the credit agreement in order to reinforce the power of the lender. These innovations have helped to create new scenarios for lenders, who under the new conditions have a tighter grip to closely monitor the debtor financial health.

40|$|Commonly {{employed}} in corporate rescue situations, the Quistclose trust (from Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd [1970] AC 567) is {{a device that}} enables an investor <b>to</b> <b>advance</b> <b>funds</b> to a troubled company {{to be used for}} a specific purpose. If the recipient company becomes insolvent before the money is spent then the funds will be held on trust for the original lender, thus ensuring that the property is not available for distribution amongst the company's unsecured creditors. This thesis examines both the theory and context of Quistclose trusts. It is argued that, whilst the devices are most commonly found in insolvency situations, the Quistclose analysis should be available wherever property is transferred for a specific purpose. Thus the paper identifies and discusses such issues as the 'requirement' of segregation of the trust property, the specificity of purpose necessary, and the type of property that may be subject to a Quistclose trust. The context of the Quistclose trust is also examined by reference to other security devices: equitable charges and retention of title agreements. Similarities and differences are identified and analysed in the context of insolvency regimes: should Quistclose trusts be subject to legislative controls, given their apparent ability to circumvent legislative provisions? Various commentators have attempted to categorise Quistclose trusts as express trusts, resulting trusts, sui generis trusts, or even full beneficial transfers coupled with equitable rights to restrain misuse. Following consideration of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each proposal it is argued that Quistclose trusts can indeed be reconciled with accepted principle. However, it is also suggested that there is no single correct classification: depending on the most accurate construction of the parties' actions and intentions the proper analysis may involve an express trust, a resulting trust, or indeed no trust at all...|$|E

When Cromie had trouble meeting a deadline to pay $135,000 he still owed Campbell, his creditor threatened to seize the Sun.

40|$|The {{financial}} {{community is}} well aware that continued underfunding {{of state and local}} government pension plans poses many public policy and fiduciary management concerns. However, a well-defined theoretical rationale has not been developed to explain why and how public sector pension plans underfund. This study uses three methods: a survey of national pension experts, an incomplete covariance panel method, and field interviews. ^ A survey of national public sector pension experts was conducted to provide a conceptual framework by which underfunding could be evaluated. Experts suggest that plan design, fiscal stress, and political culture factors impact underfunding. However, experts do not agree with previous research findings that unions actively pursue underfunding to secure current wage increases. ^ Within the conceptual framework and determinants identified by experts, several empirical regularities are documented for the first time. Analysis of 173 local government pension plans, observed from 1987 to 1992, was conducted. Findings indicate that underfunding occurs in plans that have lower retirement ages, increased costs due to benefit enhancements, when the sponsor faces current year operating deficits, or when a local government relies heavily on inelastic revenue sources. Results also suggest that elected officials artificially inflate interest rate assumptions to reduce current pension costs, consequently shifting these costs to future generations. In concurrence with some experts there is no data to support the assumption that highly unionized employees secure more funding than less unionized employees. ^ Empirical results provide satisfactory but not overwhelming statistical power, and only minor predictive capacity. To further explore why underfunding occurs, field interviews were carried out with 62 local government officials. Practitioners indicated that perceived fiscal stress, the willingness of policymakers <b>to</b> <b>advance</b> <b>funding,</b> bargaining strategies used by union officials, apathy by employees and retirees, pension board composition, and the level of influence by internal pension experts has an impact on funding outcomes. ^ A pension funding process model was posited by triangulating the expert survey, empirical findings, and field survey results. The funding process model should help shape and refine our theoretical knowledge of state and local government pension underfunding in the future. ...|$|R
