5|$|Abbott {{has created}} several games, {{including}} card games, board games, and one equipment game. As a whole, his games {{are not of}} particular fame, although <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> unique elements that set them apart from mainstream games. For instance, the card game Metamorphosis is a complex trick-taking game. As you play the game, the rules change three times, so {{it is as if}} you are playing four different games that are threaded together.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the player}} has no direct {{control over the}} patients, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> {{influence}} over whether to evict them from the hospital and in determining {{what to do with}} them when given a choice by the staff. The player can pick up any staff member in the building and move them (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required. The player may force patients to take a chance at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.|$|E

5|$|Cumulus humilis clouds usually {{indicate}} fair weather. Cumulus mediocris {{clouds are}} similar, except that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> vertical development, which implies {{that they can}} grow into cumulus congestus or even cumulonimbus clouds, which can produce heavy rain, lightning, severe winds, hail, and even tornadoes. Cumulus congestus clouds, which appear as towers, will often grow into cumulonimbus storm clouds. They can produce precipitation. Glider pilots often {{pay close attention to}} cumulus clouds, as they can be indicators of rising air drafts or thermals underneath that can suck the plane high into the skya phenomenon known as cloud suck.|$|E
5|$|Nests {{built in}} the open are large and untidy domed structures, built of dry grass, twigs, and other plant {{material}}s. Any leaves or thorns present in a tree may be worked into the nest. In cavity nests, the hole is filled with a shapeless mass of grass {{with a cup of}} soft material containing the eggs on the inside. When the disused domed nests of weavers are used, they are simply given a soft lining. The nest entrance is on the side, and is sometimes extended into a short funnel. The male and the female construct the nest together, keeping close when finding material and weaving it together. The inside linings of Cape sparrow nests can incorporate large portions of aromatic leaves such as wolbossie (Helichrysum pumilio), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), and camphor (Cinnamomum). This consistent use of aromatics suggests that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> purpose such as protection against parasites.|$|E
5|$|The Hubble {{classification}} system rates elliptical galaxies {{on the basis}} of their ellipticity, ranging from E0, being nearly spherical, up to E7, which is highly elongated. These galaxies have an ellipsoidal profile, giving them an elliptical appearance regardless of the viewing angle. Their appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little interstellar matter. Consequently, these galaxies also have a low portion of open clusters and a reduced rate of new star formation. Instead they are dominated by generally older, more evolved stars that are orbiting the common center of gravity in random directions. The stars contain low abundances of heavy elements because star formation ceases after the initial burst. In this sense <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> similarity to the much smaller globular clusters.|$|E

5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react readily with {{phosphorus}} and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula M3Pn (where M represents an alkali metal and Pn represents a pnictogen – phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth). This {{is due to}} the greater size of the P3− and As3− ions, so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form. These are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals: for example, potassium has nine different known phosphides, with formulae K3P, K4P3, K5P4, KP, K4P6, K3P7, K3P11, KP10.3, and KP15. While most metals form arsenides, only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides. The structure of Na3As is complex with unusually short Na–Na distances of 328–330 pm which are shorter than in sodium metal, and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic. Other alkali metal arsenides not conforming to the formula M3As are known, such as LiAs, which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding. The antimonides are unstable and reactive as the Sb3− ion is a strong reducing agent; reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine (SbH3). Indeed, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> metallic properties, and the alkali metal antimonides of stoichiometry MSb involve antimony atoms bonded in a spiral Zintl structure. Bismuthides are not even wholly ionic; they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds.|$|E

25|$|According to Dr.Carlos Moore, {{resident}} {{scholar at}} Brazil's University of the State of Bahia, {{in the 21st century}} Afro-multiracials in the Arab world, including Arabs in North Africa, self-identify {{in ways that}} resemble multi-racials in Latin America. He claims that black-looking Arabs, much like black-looking Latin Americans, consider themselves white because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> distant white ancestry.|$|E

25|$|Some horse breeds are {{not defined}} as ponies, even when <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> animals that measure under 14.2 hands.

25|$|Note that Promissory Estoppel {{should not}} be {{confused}} with Estoppel for Non-disclosure of Knowledge, colloquially known as 'Nolissory Estoppel'. This arises when a party to a contract indicates that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> knowledge about the value or the potential success/failure of a contract to the other party, but refuses to share this knowledge or 'nol'. The party with the 'nol' is estopped from their non-disclosure, and is forced to impart it equitably.|$|E
25|$|Morse code {{has been}} {{employed}} as an assistive technology, helping {{people with a}} variety of disabilities to communicate. Morse can be sent by persons with severe motion disabilities, as long as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> minimal motor control. An original solution to the problem that caretakers have to learn to decode has been an electronic typewriter with the codes written on the keys. Codes were sung by users; see the voice typewriter employing morse or votem, Newell and Nabarro, 1968.|$|E

25|$|S. schenckii {{breaks down}} {{proteins}} by producing two separate proteases, a serine protease and an aspartic protease. These proteases {{appear to be}} essential for fungal growth. However, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> functional overlap as the inactivation of either protein does not affect growth but inactivation of both inhibits the fungus. Protease activity {{has been shown to}} be important in in vivo infection of mice. Substrates for these proteases include the skin proteins type-I collagen, stratum corneum, and elastin.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the winds}} {{often have a}} {{destructive}} nature, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> benefits as well. They cause cold water to rise from below the surface layer of the ocean, bringing with it many nutrients that ultimately benefit local fisheries. As the winds blow over the ocean, sea surface temperatures drop about 4°C (7°F), indicating the upwelling. Chlorophyll concentrations in the surface water go from negligible, {{in the absence of}} winds, to very active at more than 1.5 milligrams per cubic meter {{in the presence of the}} winds.|$|E
25|$|Many {{firearms}} manufacturers explicitly advise {{against the}} use of handloaded ammunition. Generally, this means that the maker's warranty is void and the manufacturer not liable for any damage to the gun or personal injury if handloaded ammunition is used which exceeded established limits for a particular arm. This arises because firearm manufacturers point out that while <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> influence and scope for redress with ammunition manufacturers, they have no such influence over the actions of incompetent or overly ambitious individuals who assemble ammunition.|$|E
