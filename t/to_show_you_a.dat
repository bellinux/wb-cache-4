500|$|Kruger {{presented}} the treaty to the volksraad on the triumvirate's behalf at Heidelberg on 15 April 1881. [...] "With {{a feeling of}} gratitude to the God of our fathers", he said, [...] "who has been near us in battle and danger, it is to me an unspeakable privilege to lay before you the treaty... I consider it my duty plainly to declare before you and the whole world, that our respect for Her Majesty the Queen of England, for the government of Her Majesty, and for the English Nation, has never been greater than at this time, when we are enabled <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> proof of England's noble and magnanimous love for right and justice." [...] This statement was to be ignored by many writers, but Manfred Nathan, one of Kruger's biographers, stresses {{it as one of}} his [...] "most notable utterances". Kruger reaffirmed his faith in the royal commission of Wood, Sir Hercules Robinson and the Cape's Chief Justice Sir Henry de Villiers, who convened {{for the first time in}} Natal on 30 April, Brand with them as an adviser. The commissioners held numerous sessions in Pretoria over the following months with little input from Kruger, who was bedridden with pneumonia.|$|E
2500|$|Whedon {{has said}} that the most {{important}} line spoken in the film is when Mal forces the Operative to watch the Miranda footage at the climax of the film, promising him: [...] "I'm going <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> world without sin". Whedon makes the point that a world without sin is a world without choice, and that choice is ultimately what defines humanity. [...] According to Whedon, the planet [...] "Miranda" [...] was named for William Shakespeare's Miranda in The Tempest, who in Act V, scene I says: [...] "O brave new world, / That has such people in't!" [...] The Alliance had hoped that Miranda would be a new kind of world, filled with peaceful, happy people, and represents the [...] "inane optimism of the Alliance".|$|E

6000|$|Cecilia's {{blooming}} {{garden and}} shady porch {{had seemed so}} friendly to repose and a cigar, that she reproached him the next morning with indifference to her little parlor, not less, in its way, a monument to her ingenious taste.

6000|$|Winslow smiled complacently. [...] "There's {{something}} better {{to play on}} here than ward politics," [...] he replied.
