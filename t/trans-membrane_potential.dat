There are a number of factors that can influence the efficiency of gene electrotransfer, such as: temperature, parameters {{of electric}} pulses, DNA concentration, electroporation buffer used, cell size and the ability of cells to express transfected genes. In in vivo gene electrotransfer also DNA diffusion through extracellular matrix, properties of tissue and overall tissue conductivity are crucial.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Three {{reversible}} continuous time Markov chain {{models for}} ion channels {{based on the}} reversibility of these biological systems are presented. It is shown that the single ion trans paths {{from left to right}} and those from right to left are equivalent in distribution. This explains an interesting phenomenon observed by biophysicists, that the distribution of time needed for ions to transit an ion channel is the same in either direction, even if there is an electric potential difference across the channel. The distribution of transit time is important in determining the capacity of cell to cell signaling. The first model assumes that there is no interaction between the ions in order to obtain a reversible open system model as the infinite ion limit of a reversible closed system. Then, interaction is brought into the model in two different ways to obtain the doormat model and the floormat model. The entrance rates do not depend on the channel state in the doormat model, but do in the floormat model. The effects of <b>trans-membrane</b> <b>potentials,</b> interaction strength and entrance rates are discussed. I...|$|R

We recorded <b>trans-membrane</b> <b>potentials</b> (TMP) in canine endocardial muscle tissue using standard glass microelectrode under the control of an explicit diastolic interval (DI) control pacing protocol, i. e. feedback protocol. During sequential sinusoidal DI activation, the trajectory of APD dynamics has multiple values of APD correspondent to the same DI, i. e. restitution is a bi-modal relationship. Our results indicate that: 1) there is a delay, similar to hysteresis, of change in APD responding to change in DI, 2) and the time course of the delay is asymmetric for fast or slow pacing history. The alternans was observed during constant DI pacing, i. e. the DI preceding each APD was invariant or changed within a limited range. This finding suggests that alternans of APD do not need the oscillation of preceding DI, i. e. DI dependent restitution is not a necessary condition for the alternans. This result implies that DI independent component exists in the mechanism of the alternans. Nonetheless, the amplitude of alternans was statisticallylarger during constant pacing cycle length (PCL) pacing than that during constant DI pacing, even though both PCL and DI pacing trials used similar average activation rate...|$|R

40|$|Cell death within cell populations is a {{stochastic}} process where cell‐to‐cell variation in temporal progression {{through the various}} stages of cell death arises from asynchrony of subtle fluctuations in the signaling pathways. Most cell death assays rely on detection of the specific marker of cell demise at the end‐point of cell culturing. Such an approach cannot account for the asynchrony and the stochastic nature of cell response to the death‐inducing signal. There is a need therefore for rapid and high‐throughput bioassays capable of continuously tracking viability of individual cells {{from the time of}} encountering a stress signal up to final stages of their demise. In this context, a new anthracycline derivative, DRAQ 7, is gaining increasing interest as an easy‐to‐use marker capable of long‐term monitoring of cell death in real‐time. This novel probe neither penetrates the plasma membrane of living cells nor does it affect the cells&# 039; susceptibility to the death‐inducing agents. However, when the membrane integrity is compromised, DRAQ 7 enters cells undergoing demise and binds readily to nuclear DNA to report cell death.

The atomic thinness, stability and electrical sensitivity of graphene motivated us to investigate the potential use of graphene membranes and graphene nanopores to characterize single molecules of DNA in ionic solution. Here we show that when immersed in an ionic solution, a layer of graphene becomes a new electrochemical structure that we call a trans-electrode. The trans-electrode’s unique properties are the consequence of the atomic-scale proximity of its two opposing liquid–solid interfaces together with graphene’s well known in-plane conductivity. We show that several trans-electrode properties are revealed by ionic conductance measurements on a graphene membrane that separates two aqueous ionic solutions. Although our membranes are only one to two atomic layers thick, we find they are remarkable ionic insulators with a very small stable conductance that depends on the ion species in solution. Electrical measurements on graphene membranes in which a single nanopore has been drilled show that the membrane’s effective insulating thickness is less than one nanometre. This small effective thickness makes graphene an ideal substrate for very high resolution, high throughput nanopore-based single-molecule detectors. The sensitivity of graphene’s in-plane electronic conductivity to its immediate surface environment and <b>trans-membrane</b> solution <b>potentials</b> will offer new insights into atomic surface processes and sensor development opportunities...|$|R

In this study, we examined the role of p 53 in neuronal death induced by the sodium channel modulator veratridine. We also ana-lyzed the involvement of Ca 2, mitochondria and reactive oxygen species in p 53 activation. Exposure of hippocampal neurons to veratridine (0. 3 – 100 M) resulted in a dose-de-pendent neuronal death, measured 24 h after treatment. p 53 -Like immunoreactivity, undetectable in neurons under con-trol conditions, was observed in about 25 % of neurons, 7 h after veratridine exposure. Treatments that modified the al-kaloid-induced Ca 2 influx including tetrodotoxin or Ca 2 removal, prevented either veratridine-induced cell death or p 53 immunoreactivity. Mitochondria were involved in veratri-dine-induced cell death, as the alkaloid collapsed inner <b>trans-membrane</b> mitochondrial <b>potential</b> in a Ca 2 influx dependent manner. Treatments of neuronal cultures with the permeabil-ity transitory pore blockers cyclosporin A and bongkrekic acid prevented veratridine-induced p 53 immunoreactivity and neuronal death, placing mitochondria upstream of vera-tridine-induced p 53 immunoreactivity. Reactive oxygen spe-cies also participated in veratridine-induced neurotoxicity and p 53 activation. Antisense knockdown of p 53 resulted in {{a significant increase in}} neuronal survival after veratridine treatment. This protective effect was maintained on N-methyl-D-aspartate or ischemia-induced death but not on staurospor-ine cytotoxicity. These results together suggest that p 53 -expression is involved in veratridine-induced neuronal death and that p 53 might be a link between toxic stimuli of different types and neuronal death. © 2003 IBRO.

40|$|Transport {{studies with}} Penicillium chrysogenum plasma {{membranes}} fused with cytochrome c oxidase lipo-somes demonstrate that sulfate uptake {{is driven by}} the transmembrane pH gradient and not by the <b>trans-membrane</b> electrical <b>potential.</b> Ca 21 and other divalent cations are not required. It is concluded that the sulfate transport system catalyzes the symport of two protons with one sulfate anion. One of the transport processes which {{plays an important role in}} the biosynthesis of penicillins by filamentous fungi is the uptake of sulfate. Current penicillin production processes yield final penicillin titers which are more than 500 times higher than those obtained with the parental Penicillium chrysogenum strain NRRL 1951 (9). Sulfate is the primary sulfur source in industrial production of penicillin and is the precursor of cys-teine that together with valine forms the backbone of the penicillin molecule (9, 15). Therefore, the strongly increased demand for cysteine during penicillin production requires an elevated rate of sulfate uptake from the environment. Studies of the mechanism of sulfate uptake by P. chrysogenum, related filamentous fungi, and yeasts have led to the conclusion that this process occurs through active transport (1, 6, 8, 12 – 14, 16, 17). It has been suggested that in Penicillium notatum, sulfate is taken up in symport with one proton and one calcium ion (2). According to such a mechanism, the driving forces for sulfate uptake would be the transmembrane electrical poten-tial (DC), the transmembrane pH gradient (DpH), and the chemical gradient of calcium ions (DmCa 21 /F). Although sulfate transport was shown to promote uptake of Ca 21, a stoichio-metric coupling could not be demonstrated. It has been sug-gested that the sulfate transport system exchanges SO...|$|R

We have examined possible roles of the longer, PalI-like proteins of both Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Yol 019 w) and Candida albicans (Orf 19. 1510 /Srd 1), two species that also contain short Rim 9 proteins required for alkaline-associated stress responses. Deletions of the long form genes did not create any significant stress response phenotype in either S. cerevisiae or C. albicans, nor did the deletions enhance any of the rim 9 deletion effects when combined in a double mutant. Furthermore, challenges in C. albicans show RIM 9 but not SRD 1 is important for proper response and hyphal formation.

Anti-leishmanial drugs based on pentavalent antimony have been the mainstay of therapy for over 60 years and resistance against them is increasingly encountered in the field. The biochemical basis for this is poorly understood and likely diverse. No stringent correlation between genetic markers and antimony resistance has so far been shown, prompting us to use a functional cloning approach to identify markers of resistance. Using gene libraries derived from drug-resistant and drug-sensitive Leishmania braziliensis clinical isolates in a functional cloning strategy, we repeatedly selected one gene locus located on chromosome 20 whose amplification confers increased antimony (III) resistance in vitro to an otherwise sensitive L. braziliensis clone. The gene responsible for the effect encodes a previously hypothetical protein that we dubbed LbrARM 58. It comprises four repeats of a domain of unknown function, DUF 1935, one of them harbouring a <b>potential</b> <b>trans-membrane</b> domain. The gene is so far unique to the Leishmania genus, while a structurally related gene without antimony resistance functionality is also found in Trypanosoma spp. Overexpression of LbrARM 58 also confers antimony resistance to promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes of the related species Leishmania infantum, indicating a conserved function in Old World and New World Leishmania species.

40|$|Background: Transfer cells (TCs) are trans -differentiated {{versions}} of existing cell types designed to facilitate enhanced membrane transport of nutrients at symplasmic/apoplasmic interfaces. This transport capacity is conferred by intricate wall ingrowths deposited secondarily {{on the inner}} face of the primary cell wall, hence promoting the <b>potential</b> <b>trans-membrane</b> flux of solutes and consequently assigning TCs as having key roles in plant growth and productivity. However, TCs are typically positioned deep within tissues and have been studied mostly by electron microscopy. Recent advances in fluorophore labelling of plant cell walls using a modified pseudo-Schiff-propidium iodide (mPS-PI) staining procedure in combination with high-resolution confocal microscopy have allowed visualization of cellular details of individual tissue layers in whole mounts, hence enabling study of tissue and cellular architecture {{without the need for}} tissue sectioning. Here we apply a simplified version of the mPS-PI procedure for confocal imaging of cellulose-enriched wall ingrowths in vascular TCs at the whole tissue level. Results: The simplified mPS-PI staining procedure produced high-resolution three-dimensional images of individual cell types in vascular bundles and, importantly, wall ingrowths in phloem parenchyma (PP) TCs in minor veins of Arabidopsis leaves and companion cell TCs in pea. More efficient staining of tissues was obtained by replacing complex clearing procedures with a simple post-fixation bleaching step. We used this modified procedure to survey the presence of PP TCs in other tissues of Arabidopsis including cotyledons, cauline leaves and sepals. This high-resolution imaging enabled us to classify different stages of wall ingrowth development in Arabidopsis leaves, hence enabling semi-quantitative assessment of the extent of wall ingrowth deposition in PP TCs at the whole leaf level. Finally, we conducted a defoliation experiment as an example of using this approach to statistically analyze responses of PP TC development to leaf ablation. Conclusions: Use of a modified mPS-PI staining technique resulted in high-resolution confocal imaging of polarized wall ingrowth deposition in TCs. This technique can be used in place of conventional electron microscopy and opens new possibilities to study mechanisms determining polarized deposition of wall ingrowths and use reverse genetics to identify regulatory genes controlling TC trans -differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Trypanosoma evansi is a blood {{protozoan}} parasite of {{the genus}} Trypanosoma {{which is responsible for}} surra (Trypanosomosis) in domestic and wild animals. This study addressed apoptotic-like features in Trypanosoma evansi in vitro. The mechanism of parasite death was investigated using staurosporine as an inducing agent. We evaluated its effects through several cytoplasmic features of apoptosis, including cell shrinkage, phosphatidylserine exposure, maintenance of plasma membrane integrity, and mitochondrial <b>trans-membrane</b> <b>potential.</b> For access to these features we have used the flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy with cultures in the stationary phase and adjusted to a density of 10 (6) cells/mL. The apoptotic effect of staurosporine in T. evansi was evaluated at 20 nM final concentration. There was an increase of phosphatidylserine exposure, whereas mitochondrial potential was decreased. Moreover, no evidence of cell permeability increasing with staurosporine was observed in this study, suggesting the absence of a necrotic process. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the possible pathways associated with this form of cell death in this hemoparasite...|$|E
30|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that the GABA {{is one of the}} neurotransmitters involved in the hiccups reflex at the central level. GABA functions as an inhibitory mediator at the interneuron level in the brain and in the spinal cord (presynaptic inhibition) by altering <b>trans-membrane</b> <b>potential.</b> Glutamic acid is decarboxylated to produce GABA by the enzyme l-glutamate decarboxylase (Rodwell 2012). The inhibition of synapses by GABA has been shown in the cerebellar cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, cuneate nucleus, caudate nucleus, substantia nigra, septal nucleus, and between the vestibular and trochlear motor neurons. There are three main types of GABA receptors—GABA-A, -B, and -C. GABA-A are the most abundant receptors and the site of action of many neuro active drugs such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, ethanol and volatile anesthetics (Molinoff 2011). Valproic acid enhances GABA transmission centrally (Smith and Busracamwongs 2003) {{and is one of the}} most commonly suggested therapies for hiccups. It is postulated in a study that the GABA-containing cells in the nucleus raphe are the source of GABA-ergic inhibition of the hiccup center (Musumeci et al. 2000).|$|E
