5000|$|Carlevaro-Savio was a {{manufacturer}} of aerial ropeways originally based in Turin, Italy, well known for their early gondola lifts. Their design was known for its lattice towers {{as well as its}} futuristic gondola cabins. When they went bankrupt, they were bought by Agudio. The first mountains where Carlevaro built gondolas was at Sugarbush, Mt. Snow, Killington, Wildcat, Crested Butte, Beech Mountain, Cherokee and Silver Springs AmusementPark. The early gondola cabins were made of metal, and the later models were fiberglass. These Gondolas were also sometimes branded as the <b>Telecar.</b> The two-seater Carlevaro-Savio gondola car was nicknamed the [...] "Noon Balloon." ...|$|E

It introduced {{the structure and}} the work principles of the <b>telecar.</b> It also carried an improvement design on running gear and the work equipment, {{so it can be}} wireless-controlled by the remote control system to avoid the danger of the direct operation. The remote-controlled system has the advantage of fast response, routing flexibility, integration control can be achieved and linked with a computer. To meet various need of working conditions, the performance test of engineering vehicle was carried out. Results show that engineering vehicle meet the design requirements of the operation in a variety of hazardous working condition. ...|$|E

The utility and efficacy of telephone therapy appears generalizable across diverse clinical populations seeking care in community-based hospital settings. Treatment barriers common to older adults suggest that telephone therapy may be an efficient and effective mental health resource for this population. This paper describes empirical studies of telehealth interventions and case examples with psychotherapy conducted via telephone on the Spinal Cord Injury Unit of the Palo Alto Veterans&rsquo; Administration. Telephone therapy as {{appears to be a}} viable intervention with the aging population. Keywords: telehealth, rural mental health, psychotherapy, healthcare delivery, <b>telecar...</b>|$|E

Methods: Secondary data analysis was conducted using data from 581 patients who participated in a home telemonitoring program for 12 months. Three point-biserial and six Pearson correlations were estimated to determine how patient demographics related to clinical characteristics. Mixed model regressions were conducted predicting hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) levels at 6, 9, and 12 months based on the frequency of contact in the earlier 3 months. Analysis of variances were conducted to assess if the frequency of contact was significantly different by change in HbA 1 c levels from 3 to 6, 6 to 9, and 9 to 12 months. Results: Significant negative correlations were found between age and HbA 1 c (r=– 0. 10, P= 0. 015) and DBP (r=– 0. 16, P< 0. 001), a significant positive correlation was found between age and SBP (r= 0. 15, P= 0. 001). A significant correlation was found between sex and DBP (rpb=– 0. 11, P= 0. 015); female participants had lower DBP levels than males. Frequency of contact was not related to the change in clinical outcomes. However, the frequency of contact for the time period 3 to 6 months was associated with change in HbA 1 c for the 6 - to 9 - month period and frequency of contact during the 6 - to 9 - month period was associated with change in HbA 1 c from 9 to 12 months. Conclusion: Examination of the SPO measures in the telemonitoring environment assisted in understanding the effectiveness of this type of unique intervention and the need for further in-depth exploration of self-management techniques among individuals with T 2 D.
