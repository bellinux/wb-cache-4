The extensities between <b>the</b> <b>verticals</b> and <b>the</b> transversals happen to be absolutely equal in retinal image size, whereas the registered distance for <b>the</b> <b>verticals</b> must be smaller {{than that of the}} transversals {{due to the fact that}} the former is assumed to occlude the latter. This combination of facts calls for the operation of Emmert’s Law, which results in the shrinkage of the occluding space between <b>the</b> <b>verticals.</b> Since <b>the</b> retinal image shows the transversals to be in contact with <b>the</b> <b>verticals,</b> <b>the</b> shrinkage must drag the transversals inwards in the cortical representation in order to eliminate the gaps.
