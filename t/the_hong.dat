5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>Hong</b> Kong {{handover}} ceremony, {{when the}} Union Jack and <b>the</b> <b>Hong</b> Kong blue ensign were lowered to symbolise {{the end of}} British rule in Hong Kong, the blue ensign lost its official status {{and was replaced by}} the current flag of Hong Kong. In the 2010s, the former flag of Hong Kong was used by protesters to represent the cultural differences between Hong Kong and China; the flag was also used to protest Chinese interference in Hong Kong, as well as perceived Chinese breaches of Hong Kong's universal suffrage (granted by the Sino-British Joint Declaration). The first high-profile use of the old flag in protests came in 2011 during pro-democracy protests. Protesters often stated that they did not use the blue ensign to endorse Hong Kong independence or the return of Hong Kong to British control, but rather because they felt that Hong Kong had greater freedom under British rule. The protesters also said that they used the flag to express the contrasting values of China and Hong Kong. Advocates of <b>the</b> <b>Hong</b> Kong Independence Movement and <b>the</b> <b>Hong</b> Kong Autonomy Movement use a derivative of the blue ensign, without the Union Jack and with the Chinese characters for Hong Kong (香港) in the centre of the arms. The right to display the old flag is protected under <b>the</b> <b>Hong</b> Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and <b>the</b> <b>Hong</b> Kong Basic Law as an expression of free speech. Despite this, when the old flag began appearing in protests, pro-Beijing newspapers called for it to be banned. The pro-Beijing camp views the flag as a symbol of colonialism and a reminder of China's losses during the era of New Imperialism.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{internal}} and test-retest reliability, and construct validity of <b>the</b> Chinese (<b>Hong</b> Kong) SF- 36 for patients in primary care. Design: Cross-sectional questionnaire face-to-face interviews and retest by telephone interviews. Subjects: 500 Chinese patients aged 18 or above attending a government general outpatient primary care clinic in Hong Kong. Main outcome measure: Internal reliability was measured by Cronbach's alpha. Test-retest reliability {{was measured by the}} difference between test-retest scores and intraclass correlation. Construct validity was assessed by the correlations between <b>the</b> Chinese (<b>Hong</b> Kong) SF- 36 scores and the Chinese COOP/WONCA Chart scores, and the correlation between <b>the</b> Chinese (<b>Hong</b> Kong) SF- 36 scores and the total number of chronic diseases. Results: Internal reliability coefficients of all <b>the</b> Chinese (<b>Hong</b> Kong) SF- 36 scales exceeded 0. 7; there was no clinically important difference between test-retest scores of <b>the</b> Chinese (<b>Hong</b> Kong) SF- 36. The expected correlations were observed between <b>the</b> Chinese (<b>Hong</b> Kong) SF- 36 scores and the COOP/WONCA Chart scores. There was a negative correlation between the total number of chronic diseases and the scores of five scales of <b>the</b> Chinese (<b>Hong</b> Kong) SF- 36. Conclusion: <b>The</b> Chinese (<b>Hong</b> Kong) SF- 36 was reliable for group comparison and had good convergent and divergent construct validity for patients in primary care. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
