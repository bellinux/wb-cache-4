25|$|In The Deer and the Cauldron, Cha {{intentionally}} {{created an}} anticlimax and an antihero in Wei Xiaobao, who possesses {{none of the}} desirable traditional values and no knowledge in any form of martial arts, and depends on a protective vest made of alloy to absorb full-frontal attack when in trouble, and a dagger that can cut <b>through</b> <b>anything.</b> Wei was a street urchin and a womanising weasel, with no admirable qualities whatsoever. The fiction writer Ni Kuang wrote a connected critique of all of Cha's works and concluded that Cha concluded his work with The Deer and the Cauldron as a satire to his earlier work, and a reminder to the readers for a reality check.|$|E
500|$|Frink often {{tries to}} use his mad and bizarre inventions to aid the town in its crises, but they usually do not work or only make things worse. Most of his inventions never {{function}} properly or are of no real use. He is the inventor of, among other things, a frog exaggerator (which grossly misrepresents the size of amphibians), automatic tapping shoes for tap dancing, the sarcasm detector, hamburger earmuffs, the 8-month-after pill, and a drilling machine that can cut <b>through</b> <b>anything.</b> Some of Frink's unsuccessful inventions include his small remote-controlled plane that carries babies as passengers (it crashed), and a burglar-proof house that sprouts legs and runs away from potential danger (the legs of which collapsed causing the house to crash {{to the ground and}} catch fire). As a scientist, Frink has discovered and cured [...] "Frink's Disease" [...] and discovered the element [...] "Frinkonium". He has also mastered astrology {{to the point where he}} can use it to accurately predict the future, and has been shown to be capable of time travel.|$|E

This enables the user to {{forcibly}} release their own chakra {{through one of the}} opponent's 361 chakra release points, cutting off the flow of chakra or directly attacking the internal organs. Because this is accomplished through only the slightest amount of physical contact, this style of fighting is named [...] Due to the manifold techniques using the Byakugan and the Gentle Fist style, the Hyūga impose an elaborate family hierarchy for security reasons. The Gentle Fist's secret techniques are only allowed to be learned by the clan's [...] "main house", who are protected at all times by members of the [...] "branch houses". Branch house members are also branded with a cursed seal that destroys their Byakugan when they die, preventing enemy ninja from studying their bodies to learn the Byakugan's secrets. In Part II, it is revealed that a Kirigakure ninja, Ao, had the Byakugan of a ninja he defeated transplanted into his right eye. Himawari Uzumaki has her variant of the Byakugan, which appears to function like a Sharingan rather than manifest at her birth.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2013, the Black Keys resumed {{recording}} with Burton at Sunset Sound in Hollywood, California. They {{traveled to}} accommodate Burton, {{who lived in}} Los Angeles and had traveled for previous recording sessions with the group. Working in Studio 2, the band recorded most of Turn Blue at Sunset Sound. During the recording of the album's nearly seven-minute opening song [...] "Weight of Love", Auerbach was urged by Carney and Burton to continue playing the track's concluding guitar solo, despite his reservations {{that it would be}} self-indulgent. He said that the song's completion {{set the tone for the}} rest of the album and that instead of focusing on radio-friendly singles, they would attempt to make a [...] "headphone record". Carney said the month-long sessions at Sunset Sound were more inspired: [...] "That's where the record unfolded. The record is L.A. At that point there were no rules. It's a more open, sprawling kind of album." [...] As recording stretched into August, Auerbach finalized his divorce from Stephanie Gonis; many personal details of their separation were publicized in the press. Auerbach said that his emotional state during the divorce imbued the album with a moody feeling: [...] "I've never relied on music to get me <b>through</b> <b>anything</b> like I did on this one. This past year, I realised how fortunate I was to have this thing I can do: making music, and lyrically, saying things that are personal." ...|$|E
