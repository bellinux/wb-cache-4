5|$|A {{few days}} later, Leake {{received}} {{the news that}} a convoy of 20 transport ships carrying supplies and reinforcements {{was on its way}} from Lisbon, escorted by four men-of-war. Adverse winds and currents meant that he was unable to sail to assist it against a French naval force that had left Cadiz, and he was forced <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if the convoy would reach its destination. On 18 December, nine of the transports reached the bay, accompanied by two men-of-war, with another seven arriving on 20 December. Four were missing, having been intercepted by the French; three of them had been sunk or captured while the last one eventually made it to Gibraltar at the end of December. They brought with them 2,200 men from the Grenadier Guards, Donegal's Foot and Barrymore's Foot, plus some Dutch troops, guns and supplies of powder, tools and food. Further reinforcements arrived between 16–18 January. With Gibraltar safe for the moment, Leake left for Lisbon on 3 January with sick and wounded members of the garrison aboard his ships.|$|E
5|$|Catesby {{waited for}} Percy's {{return from the}} north, before making his decision. He thought the letter too vague to {{constitute}} any meaningful threat to the plan, and decided to forge ahead. As Fawkes made a final check on the gunpowder, other conspirators took up their positions in the Midlands. Salisbury, already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter, did not yet know {{the exact nature of}} the plot or who exactly was involved. He elected <b>to</b> <b>wait,</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how events unfolded. On 3November, Catesby met with Wintour and Percy in London. Although the nature of their discussion is unknown, Fraser theorises that some adjustment of their plan to abduct Princess Elizabeth may have occurred, as later accounts told how Percy had been seen at the Duke of York's lodgings, enquiring as to the movements of the king's daughter. Nicholls mentions that a week earlier—on the same day that Monteagle received his letter—Catesby was at White Webbs with Fawkes, to discuss kidnapping Prince Henry rather than Princess Elizabeth.|$|E

[...] After three days without a surrender {{offer from the}} hostage-takers, the police shut off the electricity to the lodge and set up loudspeakers from which the parents of several of {{the radicals}} implored them to surrender, to no avail.

500|$|Another troubling {{aspect of}} the {{production}} was the difficulty in obtaining a director. The producers approached Steven Spielberg, who was in post-production of Jaws, but ultimately decided <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> [...] "how the fish picture turns out". The first director attached to the film was Guy Hamilton, who directed the previous three Bond films as well as Goldfinger, but he left after being offered the opportunity to direct the 1978 film Superman, although Richard Donner took over the project. Eon Productions later turned to Lewis Gilbert, who had directed the earlier Bond film You Only Live Twice.|$|E
500|$|Uncertain of the letter's meaning, Monteagle {{promptly}} rode to Whitehall {{and handed}} it to Cecil (then Earl of Salisbury). [...] Salisbury informed the Earl of Worcester, considered to have recusant sympathies, and the suspected catholic Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton, but kept news of the plot from the King, who was busy hunting in Cambridgeshire and not expected back for several days. [...] Monteagle's servant, Thomas Ward, had family connections with the Wright brothers, and sent a message to Catesby about the betrayal. [...] Catesby, who had been due to go hunting with the King, suspected that Tresham was responsible for the letter, and with Thomas Wintour confronted the recently recruited conspirator. [...] Tresham managed to convince the pair that he had not written the letter, but urged them to abandon the plot. [...] Salisbury was already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter, but did not yet know the exact nature of the plot, or who exactly was involved. [...] He therefore elected <b>to</b> <b>wait,</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how events unfolded.|$|E

500|$|The Rhodesian Minister for Justice and Law and Order, Desmond Lardner-Burke, {{presented}} {{the rest of}} the Cabinet with a draft for the declaration of independence on 5 November 1965. When Jack Howman, Minister of Tourism and Information, said that he was also preparing a draft, the Cabinet decided <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his version too. The ministers agreed that if an independence proclamation were issued, they would all sign it. On 9 November, the Cabinet jointly devised an outline for the proclamation document and the accompanying statement to be made by Smith. The final version of the declaration of independence was prepared by a sub-committee of civil servants headed by Gerald Clarke, the Cabinet Secretary, with the United States Declaration of Independence of 1776, the only other such proclamation ever issued by British colonials, used as a model. Strongly alluding to Thomas Jefferson's text throughout, the Rhodesians used one phrase —"a respect for the opinions of mankind"—but no reference was made to the assertion that [...] "all men are created equal", nor to the [...] "consent of the governed", two omissions later stressed by a number of commentators.|$|E

2500|$|In The MVC Final, the Cougars faced Missouri State {{and their}} waves of {{substitutes}} on the Bears' home field.

In the 37th minute, Jambga took the ball away, worked downfield and left through several defenders, cut {{right at the top}} of the 18 yard box, and slammed a hard, low shot just inside the post for the game's only goal on what would be the Cougars' only shot of the game. For the [...] remainder of the game, MoSt attacked, SIUE turned the attack aside, and the two teams did the same all over again and again, even after the Bears went a man down when Dal Santo was fouled hard while covering a loose ball in the box. The win gave the Cougars their second MVC Tournament title and automatic qualification to the NCAA Tournament in three years.

After Gilly became a personal trainer at Look Sharpe, a local day spa, he invited Lynsey to come along for a free session. Quinlan told Inside Soap journalist, Steven Murphy, that Lynsey is [...] "looking pretty good when she turns up" [...] and she would eventually end up [...] "hopping into the tub and dragging Gilly in there fully clothed!" [...] Hassan said that she found the scene in which Lynsey pulled Gilly into the hot tub [...] "embarrassing", despite knowing Quinlan well. She added that the scenes were not romantic to film due to the water being cold. Lynsey and Gilly later arranged a date together, which prompted Gilly to remove his wedding ring. Quinlan thought that Gilly's decision was a [...] "bit harsh" [...] {{because it was too}} soon for him to consider moving on from his wife, Steph (Carley Stenson).

[...] Princess Sophia had been seriously damaged striking the reef, with a hole in her bow that water ran in and out of at a rate that Davis estimated at 200 or 300 gallons per minute. [...] With no apparent way to evacuate passengers, and Princess Sophia stuck fast on the reef, the only thing that Davis and the other rescue boats could do was <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if the weather would moderate enough to attempt an evacuation.

2500|$|WCW's {{next big}} attempt to regain ratings {{supremacy}} was by marketing ex-NFL player Bill Goldberg as an invincible monster with a record-breaking winning streak. Goldberg was incredibly popular, but business still quickly fell off for WCW, {{especially as the}} list of stars ready to be destroyed by Goldberg grew shorter, {{not to mention the}} declining quality of the PPVs. One of WCW's last wins in the Monday night ratings war was on July 6, 1998, when WCW aired Goldberg's long-awaited world title victory over Hulk Hogan on free television. This significantly increased the rating for the show, but only for that week. Such a match could likely have generated millions, possibly tens of millions for WCW on pay-per-view had the angle been built up properly for a matter of months. On September 14, 1998, WCW won the ratings war once again with a memorable moment that featured Ric Flair's return to WCW and the reformation of the legendary Four Horsemen. On October 25, 1998, WCW's Halloween Havoc ran longer than the time allocated because of the last-minute addition of a tag team title match between the champions (Scott Steiner and The Giant) and the challengers (Rick Steiner and Buff Bagwell), which Rick Steiner won by himself although Bagwell abandoned him as a tag partner. As a result, several thousand people lost their pay-per-view feed at 11pm during the highly [...] anticipated world title match between Diamond Dallas Page and Goldberg. The following night, WCW decided to correct the fault by airing the entire match for free on Nitro and won the ratings war for the final time.

2500|$|With its {{complicated}} {{political problems}} Alan Smith was made {{the manager of}} the tour to the West Indies in 1980–81. Due to financial reasons there was no assistant manager, but Barrington was appointed after representations from the team, though Stuart Surridge asked him not to go as the strain would be too much. He passed a medical, was eager for another tour and had been a teammate of Smith's in the 1962-63 Ashes series. He got on well with Botham, who wrote [...] "He would fetch me a cup of tea...sit on the bench in the dressing room, raise a point and we would argue about it. A quarter of an hour later I'd find myself doing as he said". Substandard hotels and cricket facilities, torrential rain and local politics caused many problems. In St Vincent they had net practice surrounded by livestock and they struggled to get food at their hotel in Trinidad. Furthermore, they were up against Clive Lloyd's powerful West Indian team including Viv Richards, Gordon Greenidge, Desmond Haynes, Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Joel Garner and Colin Croft. In the First Test, Botham put the West Indies in to bat on a damp wicket that recovered and they made 426/9. England followed on and despite extra rain failed to hold out for a draw, Barrington wrote: [...] "The boys tried hard, but one or two did not apply themselves. Hence the same old story. Lack of first-class batting and application". In Guyana the Bourda cricket ground was flooded for days and an injury to Willis meant he had to be sent home and replaced by Robin Jackman of Surrey. Jackman had played for Rhodesia in the Currie Cup and after a week of increasing crisis, President Forbes Burnham decided that Jackman had to be deported under the Gleneagles Agreement. Barrington was incredulous, and in another malapropism said, [...] "The people wouldn't let old Forbes Burnham deprive them of their cricket: 10,000 to watch a practice match today; it could be a real evolution if he tried it". The TCCB refused to have its team chosen by another country (ironically, it was the South African refusal to accept Basil d'Oliveira that had led to their cricketing isolation) and the Second Test was cancelled. With all flights out of Guyana fully booked and Barrington now concerned for the team's safety, they even considered using a Royal Navy destroyer to rescue them. Fortunately, seats were made available and they flew to Barbados with great relief. There they had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if the tour would continue, but the Government of Barbados saw that Gleneagles applied to South African teams rather than individual players and allowed the Third Test to proceed. Ann came to join the team and Jackman was chosen for his Test debut. With the West Indies sent in to bat, Jackman took 3/65 and they were only saved by a century from Lloyd as they struggled to 265. England in turn were out for 122, with Barrington chain smoking on the balcony as the wickets fell, consoling each batsman as he returned to the dressing room. When the day was finished, he had dinner with Ann and some friends, but when they went to bed he had a heart attack at 10:30 pm on 14 March 1981.|$|E
