500|$|The {{largest of}} the tree species in this virgin <b>timbershed</b> was the white oak (Quercus alba), which often {{exceeded}} [...] in height and [...] in diameter. While the white oak's range encompasses most of the Eastern United States, the most favorable environments for its growth are on the western slopes of the Appalachian Mountains. According to botanist Earl Lemley Core, the species flourishes on northern mountain flanks, and in coves, which are small valleys or ravines between two ridge lines that are closed at one or both ends. White oaks also thrive in moist lowlands and in upland topography, {{with the exception of}} extremely dry ridges with shallow soil.|$|E
40|$|The study {{produced}} {{an assessment of}} the lumber manufacturing sector. It analyzed the changes in this sector and its relation to timber harvest levels. The study’s objective was to determine whether Washington’s sawmilling sector can expand or not, given a projection of future timber harvest levels. We analyzed the Washington State Department of Natural Resources mill surveys from 1968 to 2002. The analysis first defined five timbersheds in western Washington and two timbersheds in eastern Washington. The study then focused on an analysis of capacity utilization by the sawmilling sector. We produced trends of utilization rates and discussed potential reasons why the rates have changed over time and among timbersheds. Periods of high prices were related with periods of high utilization rates, with exception. During the 1980 ’s, there occurred a shut down of capacity that improved the average utilization rate for the sector following a collapse of high lumber prices in 1979. Currently, the average utilization rate is at historically high levels as one might expect given the strong U. S. housing sector. Lumber prices have recovered from a short period of lower prices, and they are currently at near-high levels providing impetus to the high capacity utilization in the sawmilling sector. We also found differences in the utilization rates among the timbersheds, and they are presented {{in the body of the}} report. We followed the capacity utilization analysis with an assessment of log consumption. Log use by the sawmilling sector within respective timbersheds was compared with the timber harvest level. Except for the South Coast, Southwest and eastern Washington timbersheds, sawmills were now, by far, the main consumer of the harvest level. Substantial amounts of saw logs continue to move from one <b>timbershed</b> to another. In 2002 approximately 600, 000 mbf of timber was transported across <b>timbershed</b> boundaries to be used by sawmills in other timbersheds. Timber heading to Oregon continued to be significant, and logs imported from British Columbia were now occurring. We examined the potential supply of timber for western Washington timbersheds. The complexity of projecting uneven-aged stands found in eastern Washington limited the analysis to western timbersheds. While the projection was considered preliminary, it was a useful first step to gauge the wood availability required to maintain or expand the sawmilling capacity in western Washington. Further sensitivity analysis is required but was beyond the scope of this phase of the research. The projections indicated that current harvest levels can be sustained, and in the South Coast <b>timbershed,</b> the harvest level can be increased over the next several decades. There did not appear to be any indication that the harvest level will fall below the current level of 2. 8 billion board feet. Timber inventories in all timbersheds revealed a significant growth in volume in older age classes given the projected harvest level suggesting there exists the potential for a higher, future harvest level if these forested lands were made available for timber production. Our projections assumed current harvesting conditions will continue to exist into the future. One conclusion we draw from the analysis is that the biological potential of the timber land itself will not likely be a constraining factor in future timber harvest levels. Rather, regulatory and land-use factors are more likely to impede a harvest level that coincides with the biological potential of the forested lands. There are important policy implications from our findings. Lumber manufacturing in Washington has become the principal consumer of wood fiber in the state, and we projected, given their current high rates of capacity utilization by existing mills and the biological potential for increasing harvest levels, that lumber manufacturing can expand. While Washington’s forest products sector has changed substantially due to the significant decline in timber harvest level over the past decades, the sawmilling sector has maintained its level of use of the harvest during this time. There has been a substantial decline in the number of sawmills, and the volume of log that crossed <b>timbershed</b> boundaries continues to be significant, but still, lumber manufacturing, a sector that consumed a small percentage of the log harvest level 20 years ago, is now the predominant end-user of logs harvested in Washington, and it is in a position to grow. The change in the composition of the forest sector was not driven by a substantial growth in lumber manufacturing but rather the decline in timber harvest levels and its impacts of the other forest sectors in Washington, primarily log exports. The lumber manufacturing sector has not been without its share of change however. There has been a consolidation of milling capacity, and with it, a reduction in the amount of labor employed by sawmills. Lumber mills in Washington have transitioned from a large number of smaller-sized mills capable of utilizing a wide range of log sizes to a consolidated sector that utilizes smaller logs with more capital and less labor. There is also much less mill-type diversity within the sector. We conclude that harvest levels in the future are such that they should allow for lumber manufacturing to expand. We support this conclusion with the facts that capacity utilization rates have been high during the past decade and that timber harvest levels in Washington have adjusted to a lower level than in previous decades. The harvest level simulations suggested that current harvest levels are sustainable into the future over a couple of rotations. The simulations assumed conditions today will continue into the future. For this reason, further work is needed to assess changes in land-use patterns and regulatory constraints that may impact future timber harvest levels from Washington’s forested lands...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{projected}} {{a decline in}} the timber resource base of Oregon's <b>timbersheds.</b> The purpose of this research effort is to project the economic impacts which this decline in timber harvest potential may imply for Oregon's most highly timber-dependent economy [...] Douglas County, Oregon. Specifically, this study, using an input-output model, projects household income and employment over a five decade period, given the projections of available timber harvest by Beuter et al. and two different assumptions concerning the allow-able cut on public timberlands. These income and employment impacts are then separated into their direct and indirect effects, i. e., into their effects on timber and wood products sector employees and all other employees in the county. Using data from a household sample survey undertaken for this study, these direct and indirect impacts are separated into their effects on each of nine income groups in Douglas County, Oregon...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 03 Forest {{operations}} in the Pacific Northwest produce {{a large amount of}} harvest residues, known as harvest slash, commonly collected, piled and burned in prescribed fires. These prescribed slash burns provide a source of emissions, which affect local and regional air quality with potential negative impacts on human health. While most environmental assessments of biofuels are focused on the impact on global warming, very few studies have considered the impact on local air quality related to human health impacts as a result of slash pile burning. Alternative solutions have been proposed to recover woody biomass residues for the production of biofuels. The aim {{of this study is to}} calculate the avoided impact on human health as a result of recovering biomass instead of burning it in prescribed fires. The thesis project is structured in five main sections: i) evaluation of biomass supply, through the Washington State Biomass Calculator; ii) piles modeling, including sizes, shapes and distributions; iii) calculation of slash pile emissions through Bluesky Playground online tool; iv) evaluation of pollutants concentrations in air, based on AIRPACT chemical transport and interaction models, and v) calculation of the potential human intake and impacted populations and comparison of the concentrations with the EPA and WHO air quality standards. The area of study is represented by three <b>timbersheds</b> in Southwestern Washington and the burn period is 29 days. The results show a deterioration in air quality in the direct vicinity of the pile burns mainly caused by PM 2. 5 and PM 10. On some of the burn days, depending on the amount of slash burned and the weather conditions, particulate matter emitted from the slash burns, travel great distances away from the burn locations reaching densely populated areas such as Seattle and Tacoma, in addition to impacting smaller communities. The results also demonstrate, that as a result of the pile burns the particulate matter concentrations in the air exceeded critical air quality thresholds on some of the days, surpassing EPA’s “very unhealthy” air quality standards. Additionally, results show that existing poor air quality and specific weather conditions significantly contributed to deterioration of the air quality, as a result of slash burns. On a day with poor weather conditions, the air pollution resulting from similar volume of slash pile burns can get magnified several times, leading to 10 to 100 times increase in adverse human health impact...|$|R
