5|$|Legislature: The unicameral legislature, the Kerala Legislative Assembly {{popularly known}} as Niyamasabha, {{comprises}} elected members and special office bearers; <b>the</b> <b>Speaker</b> <b>and</b> Deputy Speaker elected by the members from among themselves. Assembly meetings are presided over by <b>the</b> <b>Speaker</b> <b>and</b> in the Speaker's absence, by the Deputy Speaker. The state has 140 assembly constituencies.

5|$|After {{hearing the}} news that the United States had {{informed}} Britain it would be ending its obligations under the Treaty of 1818 and looking for a division of the Oregon Country, the legislature scaled back its agenda. One piece of legislation passed was a pilotage law that set standards and licensed boat pilots {{at the mouth of the}} Columbia River. The 1846 legislature met in the home of Henry Montgomery Knighton in Oregon City from December 1 through 19, with Asa Lovejoy serving as <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> <b>and</b> leader. Noah Huber served as a clerk and Knighton as sergeant at arms.|$|E
5|$|All new {{subsidiary}} legislation must {{be sent to}} the Council for scrutiny within 14 days of their publication in the Government Gazette. The Council is then required to make its report to <b>the</b> <b>Speaker</b> <b>and</b> the appropriate Minister within 30 days. However, unlike with bills, there is no provision to extend the original deadline. As with bills, tardiness in sending an adverse report results in a conclusive presumption that the Council finds no differentiating measures in the {{subsidiary legislation}}. Where the Council issues an adverse report, the Minister must revoke or amend the offending provision within six months of the report, unless Parliament passes a resolution confirming that provision.|$|E

Six {{days after the}} Mela ended, he had the Darshan of the sages Yajnavalkya and Bharadvaja under a banyan tree. In {{one of the four}} dialogues in the Ramcharitmanas, Yajnavalkya is <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> <b>and</b> Bharadvaja the listener.

5|$|West Bengal {{is governed}} through a {{parliamentary}} system of representative democracy, a feature the state shares with other Indian states. Universal suffrage is granted to residents. There are two branches of government. The legislature, the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, consists of elected members and special office bearers such as <b>the</b> <b>Speaker</b> <b>and</b> Deputy Speaker, who are {{elected by the}} members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker's absence. The judiciary is composed of the Calcutta High Court and a system of lower courts. Executive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister although the titular head of government is the Governor. The Governor {{is the head of}} state appointed by the President of India. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the Governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly is unicameral with 295 Members of the Legislative Assembly, or MLAs, including one nominated from the Anglo-Indian community. Terms of office run for five years, unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term. Auxiliary authorities known as panchayats, for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a latent {{variable}} (LV) framework to identify all <b>the</b> <b>speakers</b> <b>and</b> their keywords given a multi-speaker mixture signal. We introduce two separate LVs to denote active <b>speakers</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> keywords uttered. The dependency of a spoken keyword on <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> is modeled through a conditional probability mass function. The distribution of the mixture signal is {{expressed in terms of}} the LV mass functions and speaker-specific-keyword models. The proposed framework admits stochastic models, representing the probability density function of the observation vectors given that a particular speaker uttered a specific keyword, as speaker-specific-keyword models. The LV mass functions are estimated in a Maximum Likelihood framework using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. <b>The</b> active <b>speakers</b> <b>and</b> their keywords are detected as modes of the joint distribution of the two LVs. In mixture signals, containing two <b>speakers</b> uttering <b>the</b> keywords simultaneously, the proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 82 % for detecting both <b>the</b> <b>speakers</b> <b>and</b> their respective keywords, using Student's-t mixture models as speaker-specific-keyword models.

25|$|Sonnet 35 {{deals with}} the speaker being angry with the young man for an {{apparent}} betrayal through infidelity. The apparent homoeroticism between <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> <b>and</b> the young man has spurred debates about the sexuality of <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> <b>and</b> consequently Shakespeare himself. There are 3 main points to discuss with this issue: the problem of ambiguity in the writing, the possibility of applying an anachronistic view of love and consequently mistaking these sonnets homoerotic, and finally the implications of Shakespeare's life and homosexual tendencies.|$|E

40|$|Poster Session: Speaker Recognition IIIInternational audienceWe propose an {{approach}} for unsupervised speaker identification in TV broadcast videos, by combining acoustic speaker diarization with person names obtained via video OCR from overlaid texts.

These methods were tested on the REPERE dry-run evaluation corpus, containing 3 hours of annotated videos. Our best unsupervised system reaches a F-measure of 70. 2 % when considering all <b>the</b> <b>speakers,</b> <b>and</b> 81. 7 % if anchor speakers are left out.
