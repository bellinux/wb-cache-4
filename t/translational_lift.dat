50|$|<b>Translational</b> <b>lift</b> (also {{known as}} Effective <b>Translational</b> <b>Lift,</b> or ETL) is a {{transitional}} state present after a helicopter {{has moved from}} hover to forward flight. This state provides extra lift, most typically, when the airspeed reaches approximately 16-24 knots, but is present with any horizontal flow of air across the rotor, and therefore can be present without any forward motion of the aircraft, given prevailing wind conditions. As a result, the tail rotor also becomes more efficient due to the wind bubble that is formed around the helicopter from progressively less turbulent air.|$|E
50|$|Skid-equipped {{helicopters}} and other VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft conduct hover taxiing {{to move in}} ground effect {{in the same manner}} that wheel-equipped aircraft ground taxi. In general hover taxis are conducted at speeds up to 20 kn, or below <b>translational</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|E
50|$|As a {{helicopter}} moves from hover to forward flight it enters a state called <b>translational</b> <b>lift</b> which provides extra lift without increasing power. This state, most typically, {{occurs when the}} airspeed reaches approximately 16-24 knots, and may be necessary for {{a helicopter}} to obtain flight.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} regulator {{of translation}} is {{the interaction between}} 3′ UTR and the 5′ UTR.The closed-loop structure inhibits translation. This has been observed in Xenopus laevis in which eIF4E bound to the 5′ cap interacts with Maskin bound to CPEB on the 3′ UTR creating translationally inactive transcripts. This <b>translational</b> inhibition is <b>lifted</b> once CPEB is phosphorylated, displacing the Maskin binding site, allowing for the polymerization of the PolyA tail, which can recruit the translational machinery by means of PABP. However, {{it is important to}} note that this mechanism has been under great scrutiny.|$|R
40|$|Fibres with {{electronic}} and photonic properties are essential {{building blocks for}} functional fabrics with system level attributes. The scalability of thermal fibre drawing approach offers access to large device quantities, while constraining the devices to be <b>translational</b> symmetric. <b>Lifting</b> this symmetry to create discrete devices in fibres will increase their utility. Here, we draw, from a macroscopic preform, fibres that have three parallel internal non-contacting continuous domains; a semiconducting glass between two conductors. We then heat the fibre and generate a capillary fluid instability, resulting in the selective transformation of the cylindrical semiconducting domain into discrete spheres while keeping the conductive domains unchanged. The cylindrical-to-spherical expansion bridges the continuous conducting domains to create ∼ 10 ⁴ self-assembled, electrically contacted and entirely packaged discrete spherical devices per metre of fibre. The photodetection and Mie resonance dependent response are measured by illuminating the fibre while connecting its ends to an electrical readout. National Science Foundation (U. S.).

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis represents a set of novel solutions to several challenges involved {{in the design and}} flight of hovering ornithopters as well as the measurement and analysis of lift forces produced by wings flapping in air. First, a method was developed to 3 D print functional flapping wings. The use of 3 D printing technology has greatly expanded the possibilities for wing fabrication, allowing wing shapes and structures to replicate those of real insects or virtually any other design. It has also reduced the time required for wing fabrication to under one hour. A passively stable hovering ornithopter with a mass of 3. 89 grams was constructed using the 3 D printing technique and was flown for 85 seconds. This flight demonstrates the functional utility of printed materials in the construction of flapping wings and ornithopters, which are important experimental capabilities for understanding the principles of insect flight and control. 3 D printed wings were then used to conduct aerodynamic experiments and an apparatus was constructed to measure the instantaneous lift forces produced by flapping wings at the scale of those used in micro air vehicles, with Reynolds numbers in the range 2500 - 5000. Custom software was written to extract the three dimensional kinematics of flapping from high-speed video recorded during each experiment. Finally, the experimental data were analyzed to measure the accuracy of several quasi-steady lift force equations from the literature, and additional models were developed using a data-mining process based on the Eureqa symbolic regression software. The models developed by Eureqa were more accurate than analytical equations and were much simpler, as measured by equation size. Furthermore, Eureqa automatically separated the experimen- tal data into sums of distinct terms with understandable physical significance, such as <b>translational</b> aerodynamic <b>lift</b> and inertial forces, with no prior knowledge {{of the structure of the}} system. This result suggests that Eureqa could be used to lend insight in parsing the primary dynamic components in a wide variety of complex systems...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{example of the}} effect is this: a {{helicopter}} might be slightly overloaded for take off so that it cannot hover in ground effect. Liftoff can still be achieved if the helicopter has enough of a straight runway to make a [...] "running take off" [...] where the pilot will slowly accelerate the helicopter across the ground on its landing gear until <b>translational</b> <b>lift</b> speed is achieved, extra rotor-disc lift is produced, and the aircraft will begin to climb.|$|E
50|$|Flap back or {{blowback}} is {{a phenomenon}} affecting the rotor of a helicopter as it overcomes dissymmetry of lift through flapping. In forward flight, rotor blades experience more lift as they rotate forward. This increased lift {{is a result of}} an increased relative speed causing the blade to flap up and decrease its angle of attack. As the blade continues to rotate, it achieves its maximum upflapping displacement over the nose of the aircraft and maximum downflapping displacement over the tail. This results in the rotor disk being tilted to the rear and is referred to as flap back, as if the rotor disk had flapped or tilted back, or {{as if it had been}} blown back by the relative wind. The effect is more pronounced at higher airspeeds but more easily recognized as the aircraft accelerates to <b>translational</b> <b>lift</b> airspeeds from a hover. Flap back results in a slowing of the aircraft and the pilot counters the effect by applying forward input to the cyclic control.|$|E
40|$|Small scale {{unmanned}} aircraft, such as quadrotors, {{that are}} quickly emerging as versatile tools {{for a wide}} range of applications including search and rescue, hazardous environment exploration, or just shooting great video, are known as micro air vehicles (MAVs). However, for millimeter scale vehicles with weights under 10 grams, conventional flight technologies become greatly inefficient and instead inspiration is drawn from biology. Flapping wing MAVs (FWMAVs) have been created based on insects and hummingbirds in an effort to emulate their extreme agility and ability to hover in place. FWMAVs possess unique capabilities in terms of maneuverability, small size, and ability to operate in dynamic environments that make them particularly well suited for environmental monitoring and swarm applications such as artificial crop pollination. Despite their advantages, significant challenges in fabrication, power, and control must be overcome in order to make FWMAVs a reliable platform. Current designs suffer from high mechanical complexity and often rely on off-board power, sensing, and control, which compromises their autonomy and limits practical applications. The goal of my research is to develop a simple FWMAV design that provides high efficiency and controllability. An efficient, simple, and controllable vehicle design is developed utilizing the principles of resonance, emulation of biological flight control, and under-actuation. A highly efficient, resonant actuator is achieved by attaching a spring in parallel to the output shaft of a commercial geared DC micro-motor. This actuator directly drives the wings of the vehicle, allowing them to be controlled precisely and independently. This direct control strategy emulates biology and differs from other FWMAV designs that utilize complicated transmissions to generate flapping from rotary motor output. Direct control of the wings allows for emulation of biological wing kinematics, resulting in control based on wing motion alone. Furthermore, under-actuation is employed to mimic the rotational motion of insect wings. A rotational joint is added between the motor and wing membrane such that the wing rotates passively in response to aerodynamic forces that are generated as the wing is driven. This design is realized in several stages, initial prototyping, simulation and development of the actuator and wings, then finally a control system is developed. First the system was modeled and improved experimentally in order to achieve lift off. Improvements to the actuator were realized through component variation and custom fabrication increasing torque and power density by 161. 1 % and 666. 8 % respectively compared to the gearmotor alone and increased the resonant operating frequency of the vehicle from 4 Hz to 23 Hz. Advances in wing fabrication allowed for flexible wings that increased <b>translational</b> <b>lift</b> production by 35. 3 %, aerodynamic efficiency by 41. 3 %, and the effective lift coefficient by 63. 7 % with dynamic twisting. A robust control architecture was then developed iteratively based on a date driven system model in order to increase flight time from 1 second (10 wing strokes) to over 10 seconds (230 wing strokes). The resulting design improves lift to weight by 166 %, allowing for a payload capacity of approximately 8. 7 g and offers the potential for fully autonomous operation with all necessary components included on-board. A thermal model for micro-motors was developed and tuned to accurately predict an upper limit of system operation of 41 seconds as well as to optimize a heatsink that increases operating time by 102. 4 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of multimaterial fibers that combine {{a multiplicity of}} solid materials with disparate electrical, optical, and mechanical properties into a single fiber presents new opportunities for extending fiber applications. Different functional fiber devices have been fabricated with a thermal co-draw approach. In {{order to make the}} thermal co-draw feasible, only materials with similar viscosity at the draw temperature are used, which excludes a wide range of metal and semiconductors that have good electrical property but not compatible viscosity profile. From the fiber structure point of view, the nature of the fiber drawing process makes fabricating a large quantity of fiber with identical inner structures feasible. The scalability of thermal drawing approach offers access to large quantities of devices however constrains the devices to be <b>translational</b> symmetric. <b>Lifting</b> this symmetry to create discrete devices in fibers will increase the utility of fiber devices. Also, the surface of the fiber is rarely studied though complex inner structure have been fabricated for different functionalities. Functionalize the fiber surface would give fiber the ability to better interact with the outer environment. This thesis seeks to address the abovementioned considerations, i. e. to expand materials selection for the fiber co-draw process and to explore variance of the fiber structure including breaking the inner structure translational symmetry and functionalize the outer surface. On the material side, a chemical reaction phenomenon is observed and studied in two different fiber drawing situations. In both cases, new composition is formed during the draw and {{play an important role in}} the formed fiber devices. On the structure side, relying on the principle of Plateau-Rayleigh instability, the fiber inner structure is designed to form a series of discrete semiconductor spheres contacting two metal buses after a thermal selective breakup process. This gives rise to photodecting devices in a silica-cladding fiber which shows a large working bandwidth. The fiber surface is also studied and successfully patterned with micron-scale features during the draw process. The formed patterned fiber surface shows potential in structural coloration and directional wetting. by Chong Hou. Thesis: Ph.
