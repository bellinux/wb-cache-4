5|$|Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine {{first used}} {{camouflage}} in the 1940 Norwegian campaign. A {{wide range of}} patterns were authorised, but most commonly black and white diagonal stripes were used. Most patterns were designed to hide ships in harbour or near the coast; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> painted over with plain grey when operating in the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|While the Constitution of Congress Poland was {{relatively}} liberal in theory, {{and gave the}} Sejm significant powers (wider {{than those of the}} Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw), in practice those competences were limited, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> not respected by the tsar. Jews and peasants lost rights they had previously enjoyed under the Duchy of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|American reviewers were {{enthusiastic}} of Deep Purple's {{live performances}} {{and the lack}} of a new successful single apparently did not ruin the positive perception of the band in the US, to the point that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> addressed as an American band. Band members even thought about transferring their residence in the United States, but renounced when they learned that the 21 year old Paice could be drafted for the Vietnam War.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> {{found in}} wrecks, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> seen by scuba divers. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> also popular with spearfishermen, as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> remarkably calm in the {{presence}} of divers and are relatively easy to spear.|$|R
5000|$|In Scotland and Ireland, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> called inches, {{from the}} Gaelic innis, which {{originally}} meant island, {{but has been}} supplanted to refer to smaller islands. In Ireland <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> termed skerries.|$|R
50|$|Alheiras were {{traditionally}} grilled or roasted {{and served}} with boiled vegetables. Nowadays <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> fried {{and served with}} chips and a fried egg. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> one of the cheapest items in restaurant menus, although those made with game can be expensive.|$|R
5|$|Burch's {{style has}} been {{described}} as preppy-boho and preppy-bohemian luxe, and is associated with her T-logo medallion. Known for being easy to wear and versatile, her styles are popular with women of all ages, including the viewers and fans of the television show Gossip Girl, where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> featured. In 2007, there were wait lists to buy Tory Burch fashions, which are known for color and print and often pay homage to styles of the 1960s and 1970s. Burch named her line of Reva ballerina flats after her mother.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th and early 19th century {{many forms of}} shoe polish became available, yet were rarely {{referred}} to as shoe polish or boot polish. Instead, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> called blacking (especially when mixed with lampblack), or simply continued {{to be referred to}} as dubbin. Tallow, an animal by-product, was used to manufacture a simple form of shoe polish at this time. Chicago, Illinois, where 82% of the processed meat consumed in the United States was processed in the stock yards, became a major shoe polish producing area.|$|E
5|$|Lesbians {{portrayed in}} literature, film, and {{television}} often shape contemporary thought about women's sexuality. The majority of media about lesbians {{is produced by}} men; women's publishing companies did not develop until the 1970s, films about lesbians made by women did not appear until the 1980s, and television shows portraying lesbians written by women only began to be created in the 21st century. As a result, homosexuality—particularly dealing with women—has been excluded because of symbolic annihilation. When depictions of lesbians began to surface, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> one-dimensional, simplified stereotypes.|$|E

50|$|In Southeast Asia, {{wet wipes}} <b>are</b> <b>often</b> sold out of {{refrigerators}} {{to give the}} wipes a refreshingly cool effect. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> dispensed in restaurants, at service stations, along with airline meals, in doctors' offices, and other similar places. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> included {{as part of a}} standard sealed cutlery package.|$|R

5|$|Production {{began in}} 1939 for {{deliveries}} to the Army and Luftwaffe, although the exact numbers {{will never be}} known as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> not broken out separately in the production reports. At any rate Adler built 1054 between 1939 and February 1943, although some of these were completed as 10/5s beginning in 1942. MWC was awarded two contracts for 975 10/5s to be delivered in 194344, but 13 of these were delivered as ordinary Sd.Kfz. 10s in 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} medieval European clockmakers were Christian monks. Medieval {{religious institutions}} required clocks because they regulated daily prayer- and work-schedules strictly, using {{various types of}} time-telling and recording devices, such as water clocks, sundials and marked candles, probably in combination. When mechanical clocks came into use, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> wound {{at least twice a}} day to ensure accuracy. Monasteries broadcast important times and durations with bells, rung either by hand or by a mechanical device, such as by a falling weight or by rotating beater.|$|E
5|$|The {{heightened}} vigilance of the German garrison {{as the war}} entered {{its final}} phase made these operations especially hazardous, particularly as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> attempted at extremely close quarters. On several occasions Rhodesian patrols only narrowly escaped discovery. During one action, two Rhodesian patrols catered {{for the possibility that}} Germans might be listening to their transmissions by communicating in Shona, an African language. The LRDG's last actions of the war, in April and May 1945, were to help Tito's partisans capture German-held islands off Dalmatia.|$|E
50|$|Salesforce {{management}} systems (also sales force automation systems (SFA)) are information systems used in {{customer relationship management}} (CRM) marketing and management that help automate some sales and sales force management functions. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> combined with a marketing information system, in which case <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> called CRM systems.|$|R

5|$|As bronze working {{developed}} from about 2000 BCE, {{there was a}} decline in the building of large new structures, which, with a reduction of the total area under cultivation, suggests a fall in population. From the Early and Middle Bronze Age there is evidence of cellular round houses of stone, as at Jarlshof and Sumburgh on Shetland. At Jarlshof these are oval houses with thick stone walls, which may have been partly subterranean at the earliest period of inhabitation, a technique that provided both structural stability and insulation. There is also evidence of the occupation of crannogs, roundhouses partially or entirely built on an artificial islands, usually in lakes, rivers and estuarine waters. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> constructed of layers of brushwood and rubble. Sometimes they were revetted around the edges with vertical piles and sometimes surfaced with logs of oak.|$|E
5|$|As the Mozarts {{began to}} be noticed by the Viennese aristocracy, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> {{required}} to give several performances during a single day. They were well rewarded for this activityat {{the end of their}} first hectic week in Vienna, Leopold was able to send home the equivalent of more than two years' salary. Their schedule was interrupted when Wolfgang fell ill with scarlet fever, and their former momentum was not regained. Nevertheless, the visit left Leopold eager to pursue further opportunities for social and financial success. On their return to Salzburg, Wolfgang played the harpsichord and violin at a birthday concert for the Archbishop, to the evident astonishment of those present.|$|E
5|$|Church {{growth in}} the Northeast was also {{accompanied}} by revivalism. While calmer and more reserved {{than those in the}} South, the revivals of the Second Great Awakening transformed religion in the Northeast, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> led by Presbyterians and Congregationalists. The Plan of Union led to the spread of New England theology (also known as the New Divinity and New Haven theology), originally conceived by Congregationalists. The New England theology modified and softened traditional Calvinism, rejecting the doctrine of imputation of Adam's sin, adopting the governmental theory of atonement, and embracing a greater emphasis on free will. It was essentially an attempt to construct a Calvinism conducive to revivalism. While the Synod of Philadelphia condemned the New Divinity as heretical in 1816, the General Assembly disagreed, concluding that New England theology did not conflict with the Westminster Confession.|$|E
50|$|Police {{departments}} and {{other law enforcement}} agencies use helicopters to pursue suspects. Since helicopters can achieve a unique aerial view, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> {{used in conjunction with}} police on the ground to report on suspects' locations and movements. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> mounted with lighting and heat-sensing equipment for night pursuits.|$|R
5000|$|Identifying attackers <b>is</b> difficult, as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> in a {{different}} jurisdiction to the systems they attempt to breach, and operate through proxies, temporary anonymous dial-up accounts, wireless connections, and other anonymising procedures which make backtracing difficult and <b>are</b> <b>often</b> located in yet another jurisdiction. If they successfully breach security, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> able to delete logs to cover their tracks.|$|R

5|$|During Western Han the Imperial Counselor, {{also known}} as the Grandee Secretary and Imperial Secretary, was {{considered}} the second-ranking official below the Chancellor. Like the Chancellor, he exercised censorial powers over provincial officials who also sent him annual reports. His primary duty was to uphold disciplinary procedures for officials; he could investigate even those attached to the chancellery and the imperial palace. Since one of his main functions was to prevent abuse of authority, his jurisdiction over officialdom tended to overlap with that of the Chancellor's. His subordinates included the Imperial Clerks (Shiyushi 侍御史; {{also known as}} Attending Secretaries), led by the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk (Yushi zhongcheng 禦史中丞; {{also known as the}} Palace Assistant Secretary). <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> sent out into the provinces to investigate possible wrongdoing on the part of local officials.|$|E
5|$|Early church {{buildings}} may originally {{have been}} wooden, like that excavated at Whithorn, but of those for which evidence survives from this era are basic masonry-built churches, beginning {{on the west}} coast and islands and spreading south and east. Early chapels tended to have square ended converging walls, similar to Irish chapels of this period. Medieval parish church architecture in Scotland was typically much less elaborate than in England, with many churches remaining simple oblongs, without transepts and aisles, and often without towers. In the Highlands <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> even simpler, many built of rubble masonry and sometimes indistinguishable from the outside from houses or farm buildings.|$|E
5|$|Evaluating Mountfort's works today, one has {{to avoid}} judging them against a {{background}} of similar designs in Europe. In the 1860s, New Zealand was a developing country, where materials and resources freely available in Europe were conspicuous by their absence. When available <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> of inferior quality, as Mountfort discovered with the unseasoned wood in his first disastrous project. His first buildings in his new homeland were often too tall, or steeply pitched, failing to take account of the non-European climate and landscape. However, he soon adapted, and developed his skill in working with crude and unrefined materials.|$|E

5|$|Even {{after the}} Christianisation of the Rus', however, {{relations}} {{were not always}} friendly. The most serious conflict between the two powers was the war of 968–971 in Bulgaria, but several Rus' raiding expeditions against the Byzantine cities of the Black Sea coast and Constantinople itself are also recorded. Although most were repulsed, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> followed by treaties that were generally favourable to the Rus', {{such as the one}} concluded {{at the end of the}} war of 1043, during which the Rus' gave an indication of their ambitions to compete with the Byzantines as an independent power.|$|E
5|$|Ice {{houses were}} also {{built in the}} major ice {{consuming}} cities to hold the imported ice before final sale and consumption, where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> termed depots. In London, the early ice depots were often circular and called wells or shades; the New Cattle Market depot built in 1871 was 42 feet (13 m) wide and 72 feet (22 m) deep, able to hold 3,000 short tons (three million kg) of ice. Later ice depots at Shadwell and Kings Cross in London were larger still, and, along with incoming barges, were used for storing Norwegian ice. The city of New York was unusual and did not build ice depots near the ports, instead using the incoming barges and, on occasion, ships that were delivering the ice as floating warehouses until the ice was needed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Clydesdale blood {{was added to}} the Irish draught breed in an attempt to improve and reinvigorate that declining breed. However, these efforts were not seen as successful, as Irish Draught breeders thought the Clydesdale blood made their horses coarser and prone to lower leg defaults. The Clydesdale was {{instrumental}} {{in the creation of the}} Gypsy Vanner horse, developed in Great Britain. The Clydesdale, along with other draught breeds, was also used to create the Australian Draught Horse. In the early 20th century, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> crossed with Dales ponies, creating mid-sized draught horses useful for pulling commercial wagons and military artillery.|$|E

50|$|The {{people of}} Karachi use minibuses, coaches, and large buses. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> cramped and {{filled to the}} brim. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> {{operated}} by reckless drivers who do not follow {{the rules of the}} road, endangering many. In 2008, the city mayor ordered fifty CNG buses for usage instead of the old minibuses with no fixed routes.|$|R
