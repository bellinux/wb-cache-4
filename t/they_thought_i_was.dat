25|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Pearce, he recalls the event:This {{has to do}} with politics, not to do with me because they had a local election and <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to bring an army of skinheads to Lausanne and destroy the city. Because they've heard from someone in Germany who contacted a policeman in Bern. And the policeman in Bern contacted the authorities in Lausanne. This is like gossip. This is like fishwives. This is like old women. I don't care about old women gossiping. If {{at the end of the}} day, it means I don't play, good, I don't want to play in the city of old women talking about people behind their backs. And they are so stupid they believe in all the rumours.|$|E
500|$|Originally, {{the episode}} was not {{planned to be}} {{produced}} during the seventh season. However, just before the writing crew prepared to take their Christmas break, one of the scheduled scripts {{was removed from the}} line-up. In order to meet the deadline, Frank Spotnitz, John Shiban, and Vince Gilligan decided to write a script about [...] "modern medicine versus backyards supernatural arts". Gilligan later joked that [...] "I think I was enlisted for the fact that I'm Southern, and <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the closest thing they had to a hillbilly on the staff".|$|E
500|$|Ben Stein's famous {{monotonous}} lecture {{about the}} Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was not originally in Hughes's script. Stein, by happenstance, was lecturing off-camera to the amusement {{of the student}} cast. [...] "I {{was just going to}} do it off camera, but the student extras laughed so hard when they heard my voice that (Hughes) said do it on camera, improvise, something you know a lot about. When I gave the lecture about supply-side economics, I thought they were applauding. Everybody on the set applauded. I thought they were applauding because they had learned something about supply-side economics. But they were applauding because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> boring...It was the best day of my life", Stein said.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is first}} rate!" [...] Harry said heartily, {{when he had}} finished. [...] "They did not give me meat, in prison. <b>I</b> suppose <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not strong enough for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That depends," [...] said Alan. [...] "If it {{was only}} you, they would likely send two-three lively, brisk young birkies, and if <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{to appear in the}} employ, I daresay ten or twelve," [...] said he.|$|R
6000|$|... "We are profoundly mortified, both {{my niece}} and I," [...] Mr. Foley said. [...] "Never have I {{had so many}} journalists on my doorstep, even on that notorious Thursday when <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to declare war. I really fancy, Maraton, {{that they are going}} to make a celebrity of you. Have you seen the papers?" ...|$|R
500|$|The band's {{debut album}} {{warranted}} a Parental Advisory label {{because of the}} album's lyrics. Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song [...] "Daddy" [...] was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis: [...] "When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I went to my parents and told them about it, and <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> lying and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't really {{like to talk about}} that song. This is as much as I've ever talked about it..." [...] "Kill You" [...] was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his step mother. Follow the Leader marked the first album where the majority of the lyrics did not have origins relating to early occurrences, with songs like [...] "Justin" [...] and [...] "Pretty" [...] written about incidents occurring during adulthood.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the season, O'Ree faced blatant racism from opponents, {{remarking}} [...] "people {{just wanted}} a piece of me, maybe because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> different, so I had to defend myself. [...] I wasn't going to be run out of any rink." [...] He endured racial slurs from fans in each of Chicago, Detroit and New York, though the taunts were largely absent in Montreal and Toronto. [...] O'Ree was supported by his teammates and Boston fans. He stated [...] "they were mean to me in places like Detroit and New York, too. [...] But never in Boston. [...] I'll never forget how my teammates there took care of me — men like Johnny Bucyk, Doug Mohns, Charlie Burns and Don McKenney. [...] They accepted me totally. [...] All of them had class." [...] In 1961, O'Ree was traded to Montreal {{but was unable to}} crack the Canadiens' line-up. [...] Playing over 20 minor league seasons, O'Ree twice won the Western Hockey League's scoring title: in 1964, with the Los Angeles Blades, and in 1969, with the San Diego Gulls.|$|E
500|$|Though {{newspapers}} {{reported that}} Baker had {{died as a}} result of engine failure, unsubstantiated rumors began to circulate that his death was not accidental. Those who knew him were aware of his reluctance to return to civilian life and his feelings over the loss of Scott. He could have returned to America and played professional sport, where he could have earned far more money than from a job in finance, but his upbringing made that impossible for him. A career in business held no appeal; during a weekend vacation with a fellow Princeton graduate, Baker revealed that he felt his life was over, and he would never again experience the thrills of football or hockey. In 1966, author John D. Davies published a biography of Baker, in which he noted that a relative of Baker's could not see a future for him in the post-war world. However, Davies refused to elaborate on what he called the [...] "suicide theory of [...] enigmatic death", as he feared that [...] "some of the old guard would be furious if <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to prove it".|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir, I don't think so. Two {{of the men}} {{sat here}} talking with feyther till past eleven o'clock, but <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in bed, as I had said goodnight and had gone into my room an hour before, and I did not see any one about in the village as I came back over the moor behind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my boy, {{yesterday}} afternoon Bill {{came in here}} with eight or ten others. <b>I</b> <b>were</b> upstairs, but <b>I</b> suppose <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> out, and as I {{did not want to}} disturb 'em, and was pretty nigh worn out--I had been up three nights with Betsy Mullin's girl--I sat down and nigh dozed off. The door <b>was</b> open, and <b>I</b> could hear what they said downstairs when they spoke loud. At first they talked low, and I didn't heed what they <b>were</b> saying; then <b>I</b> heard a word or two which frighted me, and then I got up and went quiet to my door and listened. Jack, they are going to wreck the engines, so as to stop the pumping and drown the mines. They are going to do for the 'Vaughan,' and the 'Hill Side,' and 'Thorns,' and the 'Little Shaft,' and 'Vale.' It's to be done to-night, and they begin with the 'Vaughan' at ten o'clock, 'cause it's closest, I suppose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{could make}} myself {{understood}} among {{them because they}} still talk a corrupt Zulu, as do all the tribes in those parts. At first they wanted to kill me, but let me go because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mad. Everyone thinks that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> mad, Allan; {{it is a kind}} of public delusion, whereas I think that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sane and that most other people are mad." ...|$|R
500|$|In 531 career {{professional}} games, Cook scored 183 goals and 335 points. He {{was also an}} early innovator of the slapshot and of the drop pass. According to Cook: [...] "I had a dream about the drop pass one night and at our next practice, I told Frank and Bill about it. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> crazy, but they decided to humour me. By gosh, it worked! I'd cross over from left wing to centre as I moved in on defense. I'd fake a shot and leave the puck behind and skate away from it, with Frank or Bill picking it up. We {{got a lot of}} goals off the crisscross and drop pass." [...] Ed Sullivan, then of the New York Graphic, praised Cook's creativity: [...] "When Bun Cook is hot, {{he is one of the}} most amazing players in hockey. At such moments, he attempts plays that stagger the imagination." [...] In 1995, Cook was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame by the veterans committee. Often overshadowed by his linemates, he was the last member of the Bread Line to gain entry into the Hall, as he followed Bill (1952) and Frank Boucher (1958).|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} that {{followed}} the premiere Renoir reduced the film's running time from its original 113 minutes to 100 minutes, then to 90 minutes and finally to 85 minutes. He told Margurite Renoir and Zwobada to cut the scenes that the audience had found the most upsetting. Renoir said he mostly cut his own scenes or dialogue [...] "as though I were ashamed, after this rebuff, of showing myself on the screen." [...] He later defended his own performance as being awkwardthe way Octave should have been. The reduction in length removed Octave's complexity and completely changed the character's motives {{at the end of the}} film. In the 85 minute version Octave does not intend to run away with Christine and merely lends André his coat for warmth before sending him out to the greenhouse. The omission of this plot point resulted in the misconception that the film has an alternative ending; this was first reported by Roger Manvell after he watched it at its London premiere in 1946. At one point Jean Jay told Renoir to restore the film to the 100-minute version [...] "to avoid commercial disaster", but none of the shorter versions improved its reception or attendance figures. When asked about the film's poor reception with audience members, Renoir said [...] "I thought I was gentle with them, and <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> laughing at them." ...|$|E
500|$|As his {{political}} significance waned, Livingstone gained more {{work in the}} media, commenting that the press [...] "started to use me only once <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> harmless". To receive these outside earnings, he founded a company known as Localaction Ltd. In 1987 he authored an autobiography for HarperCollins, If Voting Changed Anything They'd Abolish It, conducted journalism for the London Daily News, stood in for BBC Radio 2 disk-jockey Jimmy Young, {{and served as a}} judge for that year's Whitbread Prize. In 1989, Unwin Hyman published his second book, Livingstone's Labour: A Programme for the 90s, in which he expressed his views on a variety of issues, while that same year he was employed to promote Red Leicester cheese in adverts for the National Dairy Council and to appear in adverts for British Coal alongside Edwina Currie. In October 1991 Livingstone began writing a column for Rupert Murdoch's right-wing tabloid The Sun, a controversial move among British socialists. In his column he often discussed his love of amphibians and campaigned {{for the protection of the}} great crested newt, on the basis of which he was appointed vice president of the London Zoological Society in 1996–97. He subsequently began to write a food column for Esquire and then the Evening Standard, also making regular appearances on the BBC quiz show Have I Got News For You?. In 1995, Livingstone was invited to appear on the track [...] "Ernold Same" [...] by the band Blur.|$|E
60|$|One {{after another}} the merchants set {{down a few}} lines upon the roll, and when they had all finished, I came forward, and {{snatched}} the paper {{from the man who}} held it. At first <b>they</b> all <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to throw it into the sea, but they were quieted when they saw I held it with great care, and great was their surprise when I made signs that I too wished to write something.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quick, Ralph!" [...] she said, [...] "arise and clothe yourself. Hasten, {{for your}} life. My lord's enemies have fallen upon him and wounded him grievously, {{even if they}} have not slain him, and have carried him away. They would have slain me also had <b>they</b> not <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> already dead. Arise and mount, summon {{everyone}} still alive in the village, and follow these murderers. I will pull the alarm-bell of the castle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>they</b> did. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{never going}} to get to sleep," [...] George said; and Bill gave a similar account of himself. [...] "Still, mother, a short night does no harm for once, and you haven't been able to get to church." ...|$|R
2500|$|Unknown speaker 1: [...] "I {{was held}} hostage {{in the front of}} the plane by the Arabs. They wouldn't believe that I was an American citizen, because they saw my {{passport}} that I was in Israel two weeks before. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> connected with the Israeli military, and I was held at gunpoint in front of the plane." ...|$|E
2500|$|Barbeau {{was cast}} in {{numerous}} television films and series such as The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, Valentine Magic on Love Island and Battle of the Network Stars. In her autobiography, she claimed: [...] "I actually thought CBS asked me to be on Battle of the Network Stars because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> athletic. My husband clued me in: who cared if I won the race, as long as I bounced when I ran?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Emerson did not own {{a record}} player, he enjoyed {{listening}} to music on the radio, particularly Floyd Cramer's 1961 slip note-style [...] "On the Rebound" [...] {{and the work of}} Dudley Moore. He used jazz sheet music from Dave Brubeck and George Shearing and learned about jazz piano from books. He also listened to boogie-woogie, and to country-style pianists including Joe [...] "Mr Piano" [...] Henderson, Russ Conway and Winifred Atwell. Emerson later described himself: [...] "I was a very serious child. I used to walk around with Beethoven sonatas under my arm. However, I was very good at avoiding being beaten up by the bullies. That was because I could also play Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard songs. So, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> kind of cool and left me alone." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had spoken}} to the Sagoths as I had {{for the purpose of}} {{throwing}} them off the scent of my purposed attempt at escape. If <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so satisfied with my lot within Phutra that I would voluntarily return when I had once had so excellent an opportunity to escape, they would never for an instant imagine that <b>I</b> could <b>be</b> occupied in arranging another escape immediately upon my return to the city.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tut! tut! Huguenots, <b>are</b> <b>they?</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{very anxious}} to get away, {{but as long as}} they paid their passage it was no {{business}} of mine. An old man, his daughter, and a young fellow about your age in some sort of livery." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Am <b>I</b> rescued, too!--I <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> said <b>I</b> <b>was</b> shot, {{and about}} to die. Mother is dead; and so is father; but you are living, Judith, and so <b>is</b> Hurry. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> afraid Hurry would <b>be</b> killed, when <b>I</b> heard him {{shouting}} among the soldiers." ...|$|R
2500|$|Zander Hollander, {{who wrote}} The Complete Handbook of Pro Football, said about Gradishar, [...] "Not as nasty as Butkus, doesn't snarl like Lambert, but Gradishar {{makes all the}} plays. Hey, he can hit, too. Just ask Saints' Henry Childs, after Gradishar knocked his helmet off, [...] "It {{was the first in}} my career like that, in the open field". Gradishar's hitting ability was a {{sentiment}} echoed in Rick Korch's book, The Truly Great. In it, Tony Dorsett recalled the hit Gradishar gave him in a 1980 game, [...] "I ran a pass pattern and was wide open but Danny White did not see me. I go back to the huddle and tell Danny that I am wide open. I ran the same route again but this time I was almost decapitated. My eyes were only partially open when I hit the ground. Trainers and doctors came running onto the field. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> dead. Hey, I thought I was dead, too." [...] Hall of Fame defensive lineman Dan Hampton remembers asking Walter Payton, [...] "Walter, who gave you the hardest hit you ever took in the NFL?". According to Hampton, Payton replied, [...] "Randy Gradishar, 1978". In 1981 SPORT magazine named Gradishar one of the Top 5 hardest hitters in the NFL, quoting the modest Gradishar, [...] "The chance for a real good shot comes very seldom, but when it's there I take full advantage of it".|$|E
60|$|They both {{staggered}} backwards. I fancy <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a spirit, {{with the}} moonlight streaming down upon my pale face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Och! lots o' people, {{but few of}} 'em tuk a fancy to spake to me, an' whin {{they did}} I shuck me head, an' touched me lips, so <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> dumb." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Tombstone {{came very}} near being my name. At first, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> of {{giving me the}} name of the man for whom the stone was intended; but, that being Zollickoffer, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> never should <b>be</b> able to spell it. Then came Tombstone, which <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> melancholy, and so they called me Marble; consaiting, I suppose, it would make me tough." ...|$|R
60|$|For some {{hundreds}} of yards I rode on thus recklessly, because recklessness seemed my only chance. Thrice I met bodies of Zulus, but on each occasion they scattered before me, calling out words that I could not catch. It {{was as though}} they were frightened of something they saw about me. Perhaps <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mad to ride thus among them. Indeed I must have looked mad, or perhaps there was something else. At any rate I believed that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to win right through them when an accident happened.|$|R
2500|$|In February 2015, Eddie Murphy {{stated that}} his cameo {{appearance}} in the pilot ironically doomed the show's chances: [...] "I was gonna be in the pilot, and <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> recurring. I’m not gonna do Beverly Hills Cop on TV. I remember when they tested it — they had this little knob that you turn {{if you like it}} or you don’t like it. So when Axel shows up in the pilot, some people turned the knob so much, they broke it. So the network decided 'if he isn’t recurring, then this isn’t gonna happen.' So it didn’t happen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] she {{answered}} airily. [...] "I ran it more {{by way of}} a hobby than for any other reason, and my children persuaded me to sell it. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> overtaxing my strength." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They seem so busy," [...] she complained. [...] "They don't seem to {{have time}} to think of me. I suppose I had better let you go in. They'd be furious if <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> keeping you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well, I never died exactly," [...] said Mary, [...] "but I come blamed near it once. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{dead and}} they {{were getting ready to}} lay me out when I up and come to." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{knew that}} almost {{everything}} depended on how I acted during these weeks, and the maddening thing <b>was</b> that <b>I</b> {{could do nothing}} but sit still and control myself. I saw her miserable and knew that she didn't want my comfort. I've yearned to take {{her in my arms}} and I've known she'd let me because it was her duty. Those dear good donkeys, the Applebys, told me just now <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> must <b>be</b> the happiest man alive! Week after week, with an aching heart I've forced myself to be gay and amusing. D'you think I'm amusing, Anne? ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the great}} library (225 feet long by 150) {{the only man}} Mrs. Chuff saw, was Tiggs. He was lying on a crimson-velvet sofa, reading a French novel of Paul de Kock. It was a very little book. He is a very little man. In that {{enormous}} hall {{he looked like a}} mere speck. As the ladies passed breathless and trembling in the vastness of the magnificent solitude, he threw a knowing, killing glance at the fair strangers, as much as to say, 'Ain't I a fine fellow?' <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> so, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure.|$|R
5000|$|Kent {{herself has}} {{said that she was}} embarrassed {{at the time of her}} {{achievement}} saying: [...] "I got the job because my brothers worked at the dockyard and <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would <b>be</b> good at it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the first woman to work as a welder there. It made me a bit uncomfortable that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the first woman to earn the same as the men - and in some cases <b>I</b> <b>was</b> earning more than them. All the men <b>I</b> worked with <b>were</b> marvellous and they didn't seem to mind me earning the same. None of them ever dared say it, but I think they knew <b>I</b> <b>was</b> worth as much as them, if not more." ...|$|R
