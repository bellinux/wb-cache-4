5|$|On 3 September 1993, a Coroner's inquest {{was held}} at Lowestoft, and the hoard was {{declared}} a <b>treasure</b> <b>trove,</b> meaning that it was deemed to have been hidden {{with the intention of}} being recovered at a later date. Under English common law, anything declared as such belongs to the Crown if no one claims title to it. However, at the time, the customary practice was to reward anyone who found and reported a <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> promptly with money equivalent to the market value of the treasure, with the money being provided by the national institution that wished to acquire the treasure. In November 1993, the <b>Treasure</b> <b>Trove</b> Reviewing Committee valued the hoard at £1.75 million (today £), which was paid to Lawes, as finder of the treasure. He shared his reward with the farmer, Peter Whatling. Three years later, the 1996 Treasure Act was enacted, which allowed for the finder, tenant and landowner to share in any reward.|$|E
5|$|The Teesside coroner held an inquest on 12 October 2008 {{that found}} that the finds were <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> {{under the terms of}} the Treasure Act 1996. The rules of <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> require that a panel of experts {{determine}} the market value of a find, half of which is paid to the finder and the other half to the landowner. However, the landowner at Street House waived his share because he wanted to ensure that a local museum would be able to purchase the artefacts. The Heritage Lottery Fund provided Kirkleatham Museum with a grant of £274,000 to fund the purchase and create a new Anglo-Saxon gallery to display the artefacts.|$|E
5|$|The Norse {{legacy of}} art and {{architecture}} is limited. The Christchurch at Brough of Birsay, now reduced, was the early seat of the Bishop's of Orkney. St. Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall is peerless {{as an example of}} Norse-era construction in Scotland and St. Magnus Church, on Egilsay retains its round tower. The iconic Lewis chessmen are the best known <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> and numerous finds of grave goods including brooches and weaponry such as the Scar boat burial are well-documented.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} and excavation of the Hoxne Hoard improved {{the relationship between}} the archaeological profession and the community of metal detectorists. Archaeologists were pleased that Lawes reported the find promptly and largely undisturbed, allowing a professional excavation. Metal detectorists noted that Lawes' efforts were appreciated by the archaeological profession. The 1996 Treasure Act is thought to have contributed to more hoards being made available to archaeologists. The act changed the law so that the owner of the land and the person who finds the hoard have a strong stake {{in the value of the}} discovery. The manner of the finding of the Hoxne Hoard by metal detector, and its widespread publicity, contributed to changing the previous system of common law for dealing with <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> into a statutory legal framework that takes into account technology such as metal detectors, provides incentives for treasure hunters to report finds, and considers the needs of museums and scholars.|$|E
5|$|Enemies appear on-screen, and can {{be engaged}} by {{clicking}} on them. During the player's turn, three cards are randomly drawn from a deck of nine, each resulting in an attack. If the cards' combined strength and attached skills are insufficient to exhaust the enemy's HP, the heartless will counterattack. If the player survives this attack, or continues by spending additional AP, a new turn begins. Upon defeating an enemy, the player earns Lux (which unlocks rewards as it accumulates, but resets weekly), experience points (through which the player advances in level), and Munny (an in-game currency). The player also earns Fragments, cards based on the characters original to the Kingdom Hearts series and those from Disney and Final Fantasy franchises: the fragments are imbued with different properties depending on the character, such as physical or elemental strikes. Players can level up their cards to improve their attack and defense. Players can strengthen their Keyblade using materials found in each world, and new Keyblades are acquired as the story progresses. Each strengthens different types of cards; for example, Starlight is an all-around Keyblade offering boosts for Power-, Speed- and Magic-type cards, while the Snow White-inspired <b>Treasure</b> <b>Trove</b> is Power-type focused.|$|E
25|$|A {{majority}} of state courts, {{including those of}} Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Oregon and Wisconsin, have ruled that the finder of <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> is entitled to it. The {{theory is that the}} English monarch's claim to <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> was based on a statutory enactment which replaced the finder's original right. When this statute was not re-enacted in the United States after its independence, the right to <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> reverted to the finder.|$|E
25|$|The term is {{also often}} used metaphorically. Collections of {{articles}} published {{as a book}} are often titled <b>Treasure</b> <b>Trove,</b> as in A <b>Treasure</b> <b>Trove</b> of Science. This was especially fashionable for titles of children's books in the early- and mid-20th century.|$|E
25|$|In Idaho and Tennessee {{courts have}} decided that <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> belongs to {{the owner of the}} place where it was found, the {{rationale}} being to avoid rewarding trespassers. In one Pennsylvania case, a lower court ruled that the common law did not vest <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> in the finder but in the sovereign, and awarded a find of US$92,800 cash to the state. However, this judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania on the basis that it had not yet been decided if the law of <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> was part of Pennsylvania law. The Supreme Court deliberately refrained from deciding the issue.|$|E
25|$|Any object {{which would}} have been <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> if found before 24 September 1997.|$|E
25|$|The law of <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> in the United States {{varies from}} state to state, but certain general {{conclusions}} may be drawn. To be <b>treasure</b> <b>trove,</b> an object must be of gold or silver. Paper money is also deemed to be <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> since it previously represented gold or silver. On the same reasoning, it might be imagined that coins and tokens in metals other than gold or silver are also included, but this {{has yet to be}} clearly established. The object must be concealed for long enough so {{it is unlikely that the}} true owner will reappear to claim it. The consensus appears to be that the object must be at least a few decades old.|$|E
25|$|<b>Treasure</b> <b>trove</b> is {{an amount}} of money or coin, gold, silver, plate, or bullion found hidden {{underground}} or {{in places such as}} cellars or attics, where the treasure seems old enough for it to be presumed that the true owner is dead and the heirs undiscoverable. The legal definition of what constitutes <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> and its treatment under law vary considerably from country to country, and from era to era.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said that the concept of <b>{{treasure}}</b> <b>trove</b> in English law dates back to the time of Edward the Confessor (c.1003/1004–1066). Under the common law, <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> was defined as gold or silver in any form, whether coin, plate (gold or silver vessels or utensils) or bullion (a lump of gold or silver),|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50029165|title=OED Online|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|accessdate=9 April 2008}}. which had been hidden and rediscovered, and which no person could prove he or she owned. If the person who had hidden the treasure was known or discovered later, it belonged to him or her or persons claiming through him or her such as descendants. To be <b>treasure</b> <b>trove,</b> an object had to be substantially – that is, more than 50% – gold or silver.|$|E
25|$|<b>Treasure</b> <b>trove</b> had to {{be hidden}} with animus revocandi, that is, an {{intention}} to recover it later. If an object was simply lost or abandoned (for instance, scattered {{on the surface of}} the earth or in the sea), it belonged either to the first person who found it or to the landowner according to the law of finders, that is, legal principles concerning the finding of objects. For this reason, the objects found in 1939 at Sutton Hoo were determined not to be treasure trove; as the objects were part of a ship burial, there had been no intention to recover the buried objects later. The Crown had a prerogative right to <b>treasure</b> <b>trove,</b> and if the circumstances under which an object was found raised a prima facie presumption that it had been hidden, it belonged to the Crown unless someone else could show a better title to it. The Crown could grant its right to <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> to any person in the form of a franchise.|$|E
25|$|Nkukoa Buoho This site, {{located near}} Boyasi, {{seems to be}} a <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> of {{artifacts}} and features for researchers. Rasps, pottery and stone tools were found in large numbers.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the ages, farmers, {{archaeologists and}} amateur {{treasure}} hunters have unearthed important treasures of immense historical, scientific and financial value. However, the strictness {{of the common}} law rules meant that such items were sometimes not <b>treasure</b> <b>trove.</b> The items risked being sold abroad, or were only saved for the nation by being purchased at a high price. Mention has already {{been made of the}} objects comprising the Sutton Hoo ship burial, which were not <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> as they had been interred without any intention to retrieve them. The objects were later presented to the nation by their owner, Edith May Pretty, in a 1942 bequest. In March 1973, a hoard of about 7,811 Roman coins was found buried in a field at Coleby in Lincolnshire. It was made up of antoniniani believed to have been minted between 253 and 281A.D. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales held in the 1981 case of Attorney-General of the Duchy of Lancaster v. G.E. Overton (Farms) Ltd. that the hoard was not <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> as the coins did not have a substantial silver content. Thus, it belonged to the owner of the field and could not be retained by the British Museum.|$|E
25|$|The Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer (QLTR), {{an office}} {{held by the}} Crown Agent who is the senior officer of the Crown Office in Scotland, is {{responsible}} for claiming bona vacantia {{on behalf of the}} Crown in Scotland. Finders of items are required to report such finds to the Crown Office or to the <b>Treasure</b> <b>Trove</b> Unit (TTU) at the National Museums of Scotland in Edinburgh. Each find is assessed by the Scottish Archaeological Finds Allocation Panel, which decides if the find is of national importance. If it is, the matter is referred by the TTU to the QLTR department at the Crown Office, which will inform the finder that it has accepted the Panel's recommendation to claim the objects in the find as <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> or bona vacantia.|$|E

Their delicate detail reveals hallmarks of social status and the figurines are often shown with tools and other accoutrements, providing us three-dimensional snapshots of long-vanished implements.|$|E
25|$|If {{someone comes}} upon a <b>{{treasure}}</b> <b>trove,</b> {{one third of}} the treasure is the right of the discoverer, and the other two thirds is the right of the House of Justice. This law is designed for a future state of society and these matters are currently covered by the civil law of each country.|$|E
25|$|The {{helmet and}} the other finds from Sutton Hoo were {{determined}} by a <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> inquest to be the property of Edith Pretty, who owned {{the site of the}} ship-burial. She donated all the objects to the British Museum, where they were conserved and put on display. The helmet was on view in Room 41 in 2017.|$|E
25|$|Russell left a large {{assortment}} of writing. From his adolescent years, {{he wrote about}} 3,000 words a day, with relatively few corrections; his first draft nearly always was his last, even on the most complex, technical matters.

25|$|A {{local group}} of historians who formed The Boho Heritage Organisation in 2004, {{launched}} {{a book about}} the area on 17 April 2009. It features over 250 pages and 500 pictures of Boho and is entitled Boho Heritage: A <b>Treasure</b> <b>Trove</b> of History and Lore. This book is available for a limited time from the Linnet Stores, next to The Linnet Inn.|$|E
25|$|The finds, {{having been}} packed and removed to London, were brought {{back for a}} <b>{{treasure}}</b> <b>trove</b> inquest held that autumn at Sutton village hall, where {{it was decided that}} since the treasure was buried without the intention to recover it, it was the property of Mrs Pretty as landowner. Pretty decided to bequeath the treasure as a gift to the nation, so that the meaning and excitement of her discovery could be shared by everyone.|$|E
25|$|Of the {{hundreds}} of tragedies written and performed during the classical age, {{only a limited number}} of plays by three authors have survived: those of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. The surviving plays by Aristophanes are also a <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> of comic presentation, while Herodotus and Thucydides are two of the most influential historians in this period. The greatest prose achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy with the works of the three great philosophers.|$|E

25|$|To {{remedy the}} faults {{of the old}} <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> regime, the Treasure Act 1996 {{introduced}} a new scheme which came into effect on 24 September 1997. Any treasure found on and after that date regardless of {{the circumstances in which}} it was deposited, even if it was lost or left with no intention of recovery, belongs to the Crown, subject to any prior interests or rights held by any franchisee of the Crown. The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport may direct that any such treasure be transferred or disposed of, or that the Crown's title in it be disclaimed.|$|E
25|$|While a Treasury {{order of}} 1886 made {{provision}} {{for the preservation}} of suitable objects in various national museums and payment of rewards to their finders, the Crown is under no legal obligation to offer any rewards for <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> objects it has claimed. However, it usually does so, using the objects' market price as a guide. A reward may be withheld or reduced if the finder has inappropriately handled an object, for instance, damaged it by cleaning it or applying waxes and varnishes to it. Finders may elect to waive their rewards. Rewards are not paid for finds occurring during organized fieldwork.|$|E
25|$|After the finds {{have been}} {{examined}} and conserved, {{it is expected that}} they will be claimed by the Crown as <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> which will enable museums to apply to keep and display them. The local Member of the Scottish Parliament, Dave Thompson, has called for the finds to be put on display at Ardnamurchan, and local tourism chief John Peel has suggested that a permanent historical exhibition could be established on the peninsula to boost tourism. In 2014 some of the finds were put on display at the British Museum in an exhibition titled Vikings: Life and Legend.|$|E
25|$|In England and Wales, finders {{of objects}} that are not {{treasure}} or <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> are encouraged to voluntarily report them under the Portable Antiquities Scheme to finds liaison officers at county councils and local museums. Under the scheme, which started in September 1997, the officers examine finds and provide finders with information on them. They also record the finds, their functions, dates, materials and locations, and place this information into a database which can be analysed. The information on the findspots {{may be used to}} organize further research on the areas. Non-treasure finds remain the property of their finders or landowners, who are free to dispose of them as they wish.|$|E
25|$|Gopachal Parvat is {{situated}} on the mountainous terrain at the slopes of Gwalior Fort. Gopachal Parvat contains unique statues of Jain Tirthankaras. The idol of Parshvanath seated on a lotus (carved out of a single stone) is {{the largest in the}} world, towering at 47feet in height and 30feet in breadth. There is a series of 26 Jain statues in a single line. Built between 1398 and 1536 by Tomar kings, these Jain Tirthankar statues are one of a kind in architecture and a <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> of old Indian heritage and culture. Gopachal Parvat is located approximately 2km from the railway station and bus stand.|$|E
25|$|The hoard {{was sold}} by the farmer, J.L.Gibson, to a {{jeweller}} in Derry who sold it to a local antiquarian, Robert Day. He sold it to the British Museum for £600. The museum had undisturbed ownership until the renowned Arthur Evans wrote a paper describing the find in 1897. The drawing of the torc design comes from this paper. The Royal Irish Academy disputed the British Museum's view {{that it was an}} ancient gift to the gods and launched a long running court case. The Academy wanted the finds to be declared <b>treasure</b> <b>trove,</b> that is, buried with the intention of recovery. Day, the antiquarian, was so aggrieved to have his sale disputed that he withdrew a gift {{he was going to make}} to the Irish Academy.|$|E
25|$|Forman's {{papers have}} proven to be a <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> of rare, odd, unusual data {{on one of the most}} studied periods of {{cultural}} history. They include autobiographies, guides to astrology, plague tracts, alchemical commonplace books and notes on biblical and historical subjects. They also contain his disputes with the Company of Barber-Surgeons and his largely unsuccessful magical experiments. At one time he possessed the copy of the Picatrix currently in the British Library. Forman left behind a large body of manuscripts dealing with his patients and with all the subjects that interested him, from astronomy and astrology to medicine, mathematics, and magic. His Casebook is the most famous of these resources, though he also produced diaries and a third-person autobiography. His only printed work was a pamphlet advertising a bogus method for divining the longitude while at sea.|$|E
25|$|Then, unexpectedly, Tej and Rish are {{reunited with}} nearly their entire family. Their {{relatives}} {{have come to}} Barrayar to acquire the financial resources needed to attempt to take back their House. Tej's grandmother knows of an underground Cetagandan bunker forgotten since the Cetagandan invasion had been defeated a century ago. It is filled with looted treasure, {{but it turns out}} that Imperial Security's headquarters has inadvertently been built just across the street from where the bunker is buried. Ivan is drawn into the scheme to dig their way to it (very quietly using an experimental biological organism). When the smuggler the baron had hired to transport the <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> proves to be more interested in the bounty on the family, the entire scheme falls apart, literally explosively, and they end up trapped in the bunker. Fortunately, Imperial Security digs them out and Ivan secures his future happiness with Tej.|$|E
25|$|An {{interpretation}} of Roman law regarding treasure troves makes an {{appearance in the}} 13th chapter of the Gospel of Matthew. The Parable of the Hidden Treasure is told by Jesus of Nazareth to the crowds surrounding him and his disciples. In the parable, the <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> is hidden in a field, which is open country and anyone could conceivably discover something hidden in that location. It's also assumed that the present owner has no knowledge or memory of the treasure. The finder of the treasure kept the trove secret until he could raise capital to purchase the land holding the trove. Selling all he had, the finder purchased the land and then unearthed the trove and, as the finder and owner, he was legally entitled to the entire trove. Jesus compared the kingdom of Heaven to the trove, being of greater value than all a person's earthly wealth and a wise investment that not everyone understands at first.|$|E
25|$|The 'Reed' {{company name}} {{continued}} {{into the twentieth century}} long after Charles Reed's death, though under the proprietorship of Stephenson Blake & Co. who had bought Reed's business interests. At one time Reed's had been the larger of the two firms but it had difficulties in financing a modernisation programme as typography changed, and its once valuable equipment became out of date. Indeed, Stephenson Blake's acquisition was thought at the time to be very generous as it looked to be buying little other than the Reed's name and reputation. Not long after, however, thorough cataloguing of Reed's typefaces proved to be a <b>treasure</b> <b>trove.</b> Designs such as the Clarendon typeface, which Charles Reed had originally acquired from Robert Besley & Sons of the Fann Street foundry, became very marketable once re-cast using new technology. Several of Reed's typefaces are now available for use in font collections on our computers, such as Clarendon, which is now owned by a German company (as a trademark of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG licensed through Linotype Library GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG).|$|E
