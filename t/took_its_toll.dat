5|$|After {{the initial}} boom had ended, {{explicitly}} anti-foreign and racist attacks, laws and confiscatory taxes sought {{to drive out}} foreigners—not just Native Americans—from the mines, especially the Chinese and Latin American immigrants mostly from Sonora, Mexico and Chile. The toll on the American immigrants was severe as well: one in twelve forty-niners perished, as the death and crime rates during the Gold Rush were extraordinarily high, and the resulting vigilantism also <b>took</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll.</b>|$|E
5|$|On July 4, 1916, the Webb {{house was}} {{opened to the}} public with a 25 cent {{admission}} charge, but the American entry into World War I and the rationing of gasoline <b>took</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on Nutting's business. Nutting sold the house in 1919 to The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in Connecticut, which opened it to the public as a historic house museum.|$|E

5|$|An illness {{during the}} winter of 1913–14 <b>took</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on Kilner {{at the start of the}} 1914 season. He passed 1,000 runs for the second time but due to his {{uncertain}} form, his aggregate of runs and his average both fell. He scored 1,329 runs (average 30.90), placing him fourth in the Yorkshire batting averages. His bowling was rarely used and he took just one wicket. Kilner scored his second first-class century against Gloucestershire late in the season; he made 169 in nearly three and a half hours, hitting 28 fours. Yorkshire fell to fourth in the championship.|$|E
5|$|Despite the affairs, Sharaf writes that, as the {{newspaper}} campaign against Reich gained pace, he developed an intense jealousy toward Lindenberg, demanding that she {{not have a}} separate life of any kind. He even physically assaulted a composer with whom she was working. Lindenberg considered calling the police but decided Reich could not afford another scandal. His behaviour <b>took</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on their relationship, and when Reich asked her to accompany him to the United States, she said no.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Philippe {{initially}} {{formed to}} the east of the Lesser Antilles on September 17 and moved to the north strengthening as it did so.

Philippe continued to weaken as it looped around this low and was absorbed by it on September 23.|$|E

A. Palmer announced {{that he intended to}} leave the group. This confirmed Crass's previous intention to quit in 1984, and the band split up.|$|E
5|$|On June 22, showers {{increased}} {{associated with}} a tropical wave several hundred miles away from land. Three days later, deep convection became more concentrated, and the system became a tropical depression. It intensified into Tropical Storm Carlos as banding features increased and the outflow became better defined. As it moved west, convection diminished as Carlos moved into cooler water. Shortly thereafter, increased wind shear <b>took</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on Carlos as the low-level center became exposed from the deep convection. Carlos weakened into a depression early on June 27, and dissipated June 28. However, a swirl of clouds remained {{for a couple of}} days. Except for Socorro Island, which the system passed close to, Carlos never threatened land. No indications of casualties or damage were reported.|$|E

5|$|Playing a {{physical}} style again <b>took</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on Roberts' upper body, and he required surgery on both shoulders following the season. As a result, {{he missed the}} first {{four and a half}} months of the 2002–03 season; he appeared in only 14 games for Toronto. The Maple Leafs signed him to a one-year contract extension shortly after he returned from the injury. Roberts reached a career milestone midway through the 2003–04 season, as he played his 1,000th NHL game on January 13, 2004, a 4–1 victory over the Calgary Flames. He finished the season with 48 points in 72 games and played in his third All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealanders' attack {{began with}} a night-time advance on 24 August by the 1st Infantry Brigade to clear the {{approaches}} to Bapaume, including Loupart Wood and Grévillers. Brigadier General Charles Melvill, commanding the brigade, was directed to move onto Bapaume if it {{were able to do}} so quickly. However, progress was delayed by heavy machine gun fire and artillery <b>took</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on the supporting tanks allocated to the brigade. Furthermore, in contrast to the previous three days, the weather was poor. Despite this, Grévillers fell to the brigade along with 380 prisoners and several field guns. There were over 100 casualties among the attacking New Zealanders, including the commander of 2nd Auckland Battalion.|$|E
5|$|The {{effort of}} the High Court {{challenge}} and the Olympic ban <b>took</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on Chambers, {{but he had no}} intention to retire and set an appearance in the 2012 London Olympics as his main goal, aiming to prove he could perform without the use of drugs. Lord Moynihan objected to this, saying it would sully the reputation of both the Great Britain athletics team and the London Olympics. In late 2008 Chambers signed a book deal, covering his athletics career and drug usage, and stated his desire to become a sprint coach when his track career was finished. He had his second child, a boy named Rocco, that November.|$|E

5|$|When {{the region}} of Biafra broke away from Nigeria in 1967, Achebe became a {{supporter}} of Biafran independence and acted as ambassador {{for the people of}} the new nation. The war ravaged the populace, and as starvation and violence <b>took</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll,</b> he appealed to the people of Europe and the Americas for aid. When the Nigerian government retook the region in 1970, he involved himself in political parties but soon resigned due to frustration over the corruption and elitism he witnessed. He lived in the United States for several years in the 1970s, and returned to the U.S. in 1990, after a car accident left him partially disabled.|$|E
5|$|A mid- to upper-level trough {{slowed the}} storm {{almost to a}} halt early on August 23, before a drift to the north-northwest began. The next National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{advisory}} then reported that the eye was becoming more distinct and well-defined. This strengthening trend abated because the storm had churned up the waters over which it was passing, bringing cooler water to the surface {{as a result of}} the slow track. Another inhibiting factor may have been related to the same trough that caused the northward turn, though due to a large anticyclone situated over the hurricane, the weakening effects were not substantial. Despite wind shear, the large and powerful circulation resisted weakening for a time. Early on August 25, the shear and the entrainment of drier air into the hurricane <b>took</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on Bonnie, giving it a ragged appearance on satellite imagery, and the eye briefly became cloud-filled.|$|E
5|$|Big Star's first album—1972's #1 Record—was met by {{enthusiastic}} reviews, but ineffective marketing by Stax Records {{and limited}} distribution stunted its commercial success. Frustration <b>took</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on band relations: Bell left {{not long after}} the first record's commercial progress stalled, and Hummel left to finish his college education after a second album, Radio City, was completed in December 1973. Like #1Record, Radio City received excellent reviews, but label issues again thwarted sales—Columbia Records, which had assumed control of the Stax catalog, likewise effectively vetoed its distribution. After a third album, recorded in the Fall of 1974, was deemed commercially unviable and shelved before receiving a title, the band broke up late in 1974. Four years later, the first two Big Star LPs were released together in the UK as a double album. The band's third album was finally issued soon afterward; titled Third/Sister Lovers, it found limited commercial success. Shortly thereafter, Chris Bell was {{killed in a car accident}} at the age of 27.|$|E

5|$|Casualties {{were around}} 2,000, {{as the men}} were {{subjected}} to fire from the cliffs above. Problems clearing the beach of obstructions led to the beachmaster calling a halt to further landings of vehicles at 08:30. A group of destroyers arrived around this time to provide fire support so landings could resume. Exit from the beach was possible only via five heavily defended gullies, and by late morning barely 600 men had reached the higher ground. By noon, as the artillery fire <b>took</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> and the Germans started {{to run out of}} ammunition, the Americans were able to clear some lanes on the beaches. They also started clearing the gullies of enemy defences so that vehicles could move off the beach. The tenuous beachhead was expanded over the following days, and the D-Day objectives for Omaha were accomplished by D+3.|$|E
5|$|Daphnis et Chloé was {{commissioned}} in or about 1909 by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev for his company, the Ballets Russes. Ravel began work with Diaghilev's choreographer, Michel Fokine, and designer, Léon Bakst. Fokine {{had a reputation}} for his modern approach to dance, with individual numbers replaced by continuous music. This appealed to Ravel, and after discussing the action in great detail with Fokine, Ravel began composing the music. There were frequent disagreements between the collaborators, and the premiere was under-rehearsed because of the late completion of the work. It had an unenthusiastic reception and was quickly withdrawn, although it was revived successfully a year later in Monte Carlo and London. The effort to complete the ballet <b>took</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on Ravel's health; neurasthenia obliged him to rest for several months after the premiere.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Fay was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to make landfall on Bermuda since Emily in 1987. The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay evolved from a broad weather disturbance several hundred miles northeast of the Lesser Antilles on October 10. Initially a subtropical cyclone with an expansive wind field and asymmetrical cloud field, the storm gradually attained tropical characteristics as it turned north, transitioning into a tropical storm early on October11. Despite being plagued by disruptive wind shear {{for most of its}} duration, Tropical Storm Fay steadily intensified. Veering toward the east, Fay briefly achieved Category 1 hurricane status while making landfall on Bermuda early on October12. Wind shear eventually <b>took</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on Fay, causing the hurricane to weaken to a tropical storm later that day and degenerate into an open trough early on October13.|$|E
