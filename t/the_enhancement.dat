5|$|As Linfa (locally {{known as}} Egay) {{approached}} {{closer to the}} Philippine island of Luzon, PAGASA issued Public Storm Warning Signal (PSWS) #2, expecting gale force-winds in Apayao, Aurora, Cagayan, northern Isabela, Kalinga, and Quirino, including the offshore Babuyan and Calayan islands. A lower PSWS was issued for other portions of Luzon. Ahead of the storm, 45,336people evacuated in the Philippines, utilizing 31government shelters and assisted by police officers. Restricted travel by boat stranded 1,147people during the storm's passage.

5|$|The {{innovation}} of {{movable type}} printing {{was made by}} the artisan Bi Sheng (990–1051), first described by the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088. The collection of Bi Sheng's original clay-fired typeface was passed on to one of Shen Kuo's nephews, and was carefully preserved. Movable type enhanced the already widespread use of woodblock methods of printing thousands of documents and volumes of written literature, consumed eagerly by an increasingly literate public. The advancement of printing deeply affected education and the scholar-official class, since more books could be made faster while mass-produced, printed books were cheaper in comparison to laborious handwritten copies. <b>The</b> <b>enhancement</b> of widespread printing and print culture in the Song period was thus a direct catalyst in the rise of social mobility and expansion of the educated class of scholar elites, the latter which expanded dramatically in size from the 11th to 13th centuries.|$|E

40|$|Upper stratospheric {{enhancements}} in NOx (NO and NO 2) {{were observed}} at {{high northern latitudes}} from March through at least July of 2004.

They were accompanied by reductions in O- 3 of more than 60 % in some cases. The analysis suggests that energetic particle precipitation led to substantial NOx production in the upper atmosphere beginning with the remarkable solar storms in late October 2003 and possibly persisting through January. Downward transport of the excess NOx, facilitated by unique meteorological conditions in 2004 that led to an unusually strong upper stratospheric vortex from late January through March, caused <b>the</b> <b>enhancements...</b>|$|R
