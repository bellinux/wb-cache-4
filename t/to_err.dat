500|$|Clarke had to {{deal with}} four natural {{disasters}} during his tenure. An outbreak of smallpox in 1894 was the result of labour migration and men returning from working in Witwatersrand. When it proved too costly for the people, he waived the charge for the vaccination. Locust swarms in 1894 and 1895 caused damage to crops and resulted in famine in 1896. The government response was to offer the chief of each tribe a reward of 3d for every muid of locusts collected as well as cattle to slaughter when a swarm was eradicated. At the same time, Clarke bought 1,090 muids of quick-growing mealies to be given on payment to families requiring immediate relief, a measure of which Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson, Governor of Natal, approved: [...] "It is better <b>to</b> <b>err</b> on the side of unnecessary expenditure than to run the risk of exposing the people to starvation."

500|$|Such {{writings}} may {{be dismissed}} by skeptics {{as a political}} stunt aimed at attracting support for continued resistance by appealing to the widely held Confucian value of monarchical loyalty. This is the explanation suggested by the Marxist authors: [...] "On the one hand, Trương Định opposed Tự Đức's order to lay down his arms; on the other hand, he exploited Tự Đức's name in order to call upon the people to rise and fight the French". McLeod argues that the best explanation for Định's continued insurgency was that the Confucian tradition allows for a loyal official to disobey his sovereign without calling the sovereign's authority into question. This is termed a tránh thần, meaning a minister {{who is willing to}} dispute his sovereign's orders in order to prevent the ruler from committing a mistake, even if this incurred his ire. The minister who allowed the ruler <b>to</b> <b>err</b> rather than risk upsetting him was regarded as a sycophant, a careerist rather a loyal adviser. The loyal official was thus required in certain circumstances to remonstrate with and even to disobey his sovereign to show his concern for the monarch. Thus, according to McLeod, Định's disobedience did not ipso facto constitute a rejection of Tự Đức's authority.|$|E

It was a moral dilemma to do that, but the approach was that it was better to fight from inside than not at all. The moral dilemma came up when I had to apply the law." [...] He noted in 1992 that most South African judges [...] "applied such [...] laws without commenting upon their moral turpitude." [...] A number, including Goldstone, were more outspoken – a policy that he felt aided the credibility of the courts.

The script for [...] "Bop Gun" [...] was completed before the first season ended, but NBC executives asked for several refinements [...] including less involved plots and fewer camera movements [...] before approving a second season. In an attempt to appease the network and improve ratings, executive producers Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana sought to make subtle changes to give the show a stronger mainstream appeal, while aiming not to compromise its integrity or originality. With [...] "Bop Gun", the producers slightly toned down the bleak visual style and hand-held photography motif. It is also the first episode {{to focus on a}} single story, rather than multiple subplots, which Fontana felt allowed the writers to tell the main story better. Fontana said of the changes to the series, [...] "We were experimenting with our first nine episodes. Whenever you try something new, you tend <b>to</b> <b>err</b> on the side of breaking ground. But we'd rather have more people watching, so the colors and lighting are slightly brighter, and the camera movements are not as jarring." [...] "Bop Gun" [...] marked the first episode with Jean de Segonzac as director of photography. The first scene, which depicts the moments immediately before the shooting, juxtaposes shots of the Ellison family admiring the tourist attractions of Baltimore with shots of their shooters playing basketball before following the family. The photography depicts the different sides of Baltimore by presenting the Ellison family shots like a cheerful tourist advertisement, with the other shots presenting a grittier image of the city.|$|E

40|$|Parkin, whose {{mutations}} cause Parkinson disease (PD), controls {{oxidative stress}} {{by limiting the}} expression of monoamine oxidases (MAO) —mitochondrial enzymes responsible for the oxidative de-amination of dopamine. Here, we show that parkin performed this function by increasing the ubiquitination and degradation of estrogen-related receptors (ERR), orphan nuclear receptors that play critical roles in the transcription regulation of many nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. All three ERRs (α, β and γ) increased the transcription of MAOs A and B; the effects were abolished by parkin, but not by its PD-linked mutants. Parkin bound <b>to</b> <b>ERRs</b> and increased their ubiquitination and degradation. In fibroblasts from PD patients with parkin mutations or brain slices from parkin knockout mice, degradation of ERRs was significantly attenuated. The results reveal the molecular mechanism by which parkin suppresses the transcription of MAOs to control oxidative stress induced by dopamine oxidation...|$|R
