5|$|Life Is Good {{features}} personal subject matter, {{themes of}} adulthood and nostalgia, and reflections on Nas' {{personal life and}} experience in hip hop. His rapping {{is characterized by a}} relaxed, plainspoken flow, internal rhymes, and a <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> veers from malicious to nostalgic and introspective. The album's production incorporates orchestral elements and musical references to both contemporary and golden age hip hop, including boom bap beats and old school samples.|$|E
5|$|The red ground {{resulted}} in a warmth of <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> {{was picked up by}} the sensitive panchromatic film. Over that was applied liquid greasepaint, and then finally a colorless translucent talcum. Seiderman created the effect of skin pores on Kane's face by stippling the surface with a negative cast he made from an orange peel.|$|E
50|$|According to Sifferman, the F-major chords in {{the right}} hand on beats one and three, {{starting}} halfway through measure 45, are the <b>tones</b> <b>that</b> are created when air is “blown into” a harmonica. The <b>tones</b> <b>that</b> occur when breath is “drawn in” through the instrument comprise the B major seventh chord. On a typical diatonic harmonica, the <b>tones</b> <b>that</b> are created when air is drawn through the instrument correspond to the dominant of the key of the instrument, not the tritone. This further illustrates Barber’s use of the tritone in this movement.|$|R

5|$|Wollstonecraft did not {{employ the}} formal argumentation or logical prose style common to 18th-century {{philosophical}} writing when composing her own works. The Rights of Woman {{is a long}} essay that introduces all of its major topics in the opening chapters and then repeatedly returns to them, each time from {{a different point of}} view. It also adopts a hybrid <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> combines rational argument with the fervent rhetoric of sensibility.|$|E
5|$|Candide is characterised by its sarcastic tone {{as well as}} by its erratic, fantastical and {{fast-moving}} plot. A picaresque novel with a story {{similar to}} that of a more serious coming-of-age narrative (Bildungsroman), it parodies many adventure and romance clichés, the struggles of which are caricatured in a <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> is mordantly matter-of-fact. Still, the events discussed are often based on historical happenings, such as the Seven Years' War and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. As philosophers of Voltaire's day contended with the problem of evil, so too does Candide in this short novel, albeit more directly and humorously. Voltaire ridicules religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, and philosophers through allegory; most conspicuously, he assaults Leibniz and his optimism.|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed tightly {{as if in}} prayer, and {{positioned}} so low in the painting as {{to appear to be}} resting on the frame. They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of high <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E

5|$|IV. Rondo: Allegretto – Presto. This lyrical rondo {{movement}} {{consists of}} flowing triplet movement and endless songful melody. Its form is a sonata-rondo (A–B–A–development–A–B–A–coda). The Rondo's main and opening theme {{is taken from}} the slow movement of the sonata D. 537 of 1817. Charles Fisk {{has pointed out that}} this theme would make musical sense as a response subsequent to the questioning leading <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> closes the Allegro's opening fanfare; in this capacity the Rondo's lyricism is the dramatically delayed final goal of the sonata. The second thematic group is written in the traditional dominant key; however, it is very long, modulating through many different subdominant tonalities. The development section, in contrast, culminates in a long passage in C-sharp minor with a climax characterized by a tension-building ambiguity between E major and C-sharp minor and a greatly prolonged evasion of a cadence. This leads to a false recapitulation in F-sharp major, which then modulates to begin again in the home key. In the coda, the main theme returns fragmented, with full bar pauses, which lead each time to unexpected changes of key. This is followed by an agitated presto section, based on the final bars of the main theme, and the sonata concludes with a bold evocation of its very opening measures, with an ascending arpeggio (essentially an inversion of the descending figure from the Allegro's second phrase), followed by a fortissimo full statement of the opening fanfare in retrograde.|$|E

25|$|Harmonically, the {{interval}} usually occurs as {{some form of}} dissonance or a nonchord <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> {{is not part of}} the functional harmony. It may also appear in inversions of a major seventh chord, and in many added tone chords.|$|E

25|$|In Ireland, {{the effect}} was to {{transform}} what had been an attempt by Protestant settlers to gain some autonomy into a mass movement led by the Society of United Irishmen involving Catholics and Protestants. It stimulated the demand for further reform throughout Ireland, especially in Ulster. The upshot was a revolt in 1798, led by Wolfe <b>Tone,</b> <b>that</b> was crushed by Britain.|$|E

25|$|Polychords {{are formed}} {{by two or}} more chords superimposed. Often these may be {{analysed}} as extended chords; examples include tertian, altered chord, secundal chord, quartal and quintal harmony and Tristan chord). Another example is when G7(119) (G–B–D–F–A–C) is formed from G major (G–B–D) and D major (D–F–A). A nonchord tone is a dissonant or unstable <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> lies outside the chord currently heard, though often resolving to a chord tone.|$|E
25|$|Realism {{began to}} {{influence}} American drama, partly through Howells, but also through Europeans such as Ibsen and Zola. Although realism was most influential in set design and staging—audiences loved {{the special effects}} offered up by the popular melodramas—and {{in the growth of}} local color plays, it also showed up in the more subdued, less romantic <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> reflected the effects of the Civil War and continued social turmoil on the American psyche.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the leniency shown to the largely upper class leadership, {{the full weight of}} military repression was inflicted upon the common people throughout the years 1797-98 with untold thousands suffering imprisonment, torture, transportation and death.

25|$|A PSK31 {{operator}} typically uses a single-sideband (SSB) transceiver {{connected to}} the sound card of a computer running PSK31 software. When the operator enters a message for transmission, the software produces an audio <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> sounds, to the human ear, like a continuous whistle with a slight warble. This sound is then fed through either a microphone jack (using an intermediate resistive attenuator to reduce the sound card's output power to microphone levels) or an auxiliary connection into the transceiver, from which it is transmitted.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that the smaller oil was intended as an anatomical study or an experiment in emotional <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> Eakins decided not to submit to the Academy. The small size, , was used by Eakins for only two other portraits. Of frontal format, it is more directly confrontational than the Academy's painting, and appears to have been left unfinished. The artist may have been wearing a gray sweater seen previously in an 1895 photograph. Eakins' student Charles Bregler recalled that the painting was made in one sitting.|$|E

Dressed beautifully, she makes her entrance with perfect timing, and immediately endears herself to the Prince. Only Bendicò, growling in a corner, seems unhappy to see her. Finally, narration also describes how Angelica, as she's listening, coolly considers the financial and sexual prosperity that awaits them, and comments that, within a few years of the marriage, Angelica will become one of the great political kingmakers of the Italian Kingdom.|$|E
