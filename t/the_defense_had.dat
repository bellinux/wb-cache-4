5|$|The Bears' first away game of {{the season}} {{occurred}} in Seattle, who led the all-time series 10–6, including the last three regular season games. However, the Bears had won the last game in Seattle in 2009 25–19. The Bears offense, not featuring Jay Cutler nor Alshon Jeffery, faced a defense led by Kam Chancellor, who returned to the Seahawks after a holdout. Without Chancellor for the first two games of the season, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> allowed quarterbacks to complete 72 percent of their passes with a passer rating of 116.4. Jeff Joniak believed that to counter the Legion of Boom, the Bears had to balance the rushing and passing attacks, while watching for a blitz that pressured Aaron Rodgers 19 times in week two. On defense, the Bears had to watch for quarterback Russell Wilson, though he had struggled with pressure in the first two games, being sacked a total of eight times. Additionally, the run defense had to be aware of a running game led by Marshawn Lynch; the corps had averaged 121.5 yards per game. On special teams, the Bears had to stop speedy rookie receiver Tyler Lockett, who had scored on a punt return earlier in the season.|$|E
25|$|At the trial's {{conclusion}} — {{after the}} prosecution and <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> presented their cases — the jury took 54 minutes on March 1, 1969, to find Clay Shaw not guilty.|$|E

25|$|When the case, by now a cause celebre, {{came back}} to Judge Hawkins, he granted the request {{for a change of}} venue. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> urged for a move to the city of Birmingham, Alabama, but the case was {{transferred}} to the small, rural community of Decatur.

But when Darrow told him that a settlement was possible only if both brothers pleaded guilty, J. B. gave his consent. Darrow sent for {{a representative of the}} AFL. The shocked labor leader refused to accept the agreement until Darrow convinced him that <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> almost no chance.|$|E
25|$|Judge Callahan did {{not rule}} that {{excluding}} people by race was constitutional, only that <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> not proven that African-Americans had been deliberately excluded. By letting Leibowitz go on record on this issue, Judge Callahan provided grounds for the case to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court for a second time. It {{was the basis for}} the court's finding in Norris v. Alabama (1935), that an exclusion of African-American grand jurors had occurred, violating the due process clause of the Constitution.|$|E
50|$|The quarterback kneel {{is mainly}} used {{when the team}} in the lead has {{possession}} of the ball with {{less than two minutes}} on the game clock. With the 40-second play clock in the NFL and NCAA, two minutes (120 seconds) is in theory the maximum amount of time that can be run off on three consecutive quarterback kneels; this assumes it is first down and <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> no timeouts remaining. A team cannot run more than three consecutive quarterback kneels as doing so on fourth down turns the ball over to the opponent and guarantees them at least one opportunity to score. The decision to run the quarterback kneel depends on the amount of time remaining in the game, the down, and the number of timeouts <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> remaining. For example, if there is one minute remaining on the game clock on first down, and <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> one timeout left, the offense may use two successive quarterback kneels to completely run out the clock, and if <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> uses its timeout the offense can simply run a third kneel to run out the clock. However, if there is one minute remaining on the game clock on third down, then regardless of how many timeouts <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has,</b> quarterback kneels will not completely run out the clock and the offense must try to make a first down.|$|R

25|$|In the March 2006 {{issue of}} the Personnel Plus, an article revived false blood libel accusations from the infamous 1911 Beilis Trial by mischaracterizing the verdict as the jury {{recognizing}} the case as ritual murder by persons unknown even though it found Beilis himself not guilty, when in fact <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> entirely rested on demolishing the concept of Jewish ritual murder. A week earlier, MAUP leaders had visited the grave of Andrei Yuschinsky, the Christian boy {{who had been the}} victim in the case.|$|E
25|$|In his {{rebuttal}} closing argument, {{defense attorney}} Art Hanes Jr. attacked the evidence {{presented by the}} prosecution as being purely circumstantial, adding that similar circumstantial evidence had earlier seen Chambliss acquitted of the church bombing in 1963.

25|$|For {{an example}} of how this rule limits the Court's powers under the Equal Protection Clause, see McClesky v. Kemp (1987). In that case a black man was convicted of murdering a white police officer and sentenced to death in the state of Georgia. A study found that killers of whites {{were more likely to be}} sentenced to death than were killers of blacks. The Court found that <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> failed to prove that such data {{demonstrated}} the requisite discriminatory intent by the Georgia legislature and executive branch.|$|E

After Zamora was convicted and sentenced to life, he unsuccessfully appealed his sentence, blaming Rubin for the TV intoxication defense which he claimed had made a joke of his trial. The federal appeals court ruled that evidence against Zamora was overwhelming and that Rubin had made the best of a weak case; <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> in fact helped Zamora by focusing attention on Zamora's deprived background. Zamora was released from prison in 2004 after having served 27 years in prison. A Costa Rican national, Zamora was repatriated to that country.|$|E
25|$|Scottsboro: A Tragedy of the American South (1969) by Dan T. Carter {{was widely}} {{thought to be}} authoritative, but it wrongly {{asserted}} that Price and Bates were dead. An NBC TV movie, Judge Horton and the Scottsboro Boys (1976), asserted that <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> proven that Price and Bates were prostitutes; both sued NBC over their portrayals. Bates died in 1976 in Washington state, where she lived with her carpenter husband, and her case was not heard. Price's case was initially dismissed but she appealed. When the US Supreme Court agreed {{to hear the case}} in 1977, Price disregarded the advice of her lawyer and accepted a settlement from NBC. She used the money to buy a house. Price died in 1983, in Lincoln County, Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the time}} Moore's body was discovered, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> {{obtained}} {{records from the}} city's Housing Authority showing that Moore had paid all her rent on time, and casting doubt on the prosecution's theory of Bonie's motive as a rent dispute. The prosecution, which had attached to the indictment a report from a detective who spoke with Bonie three days after Moore's disappearance quoting Bonie as saying that she owed him rent and {{he was planning to}} have her evicted, said that their theory was not that she had failed to pay her rent, but that Bonie had been pressuring her to file false Section 8 paperwork so he could collect additional rent. They wanted to see if he had made any statements during the interview that either confirmed that theory or contradicted his earlier statements.|$|E

25|$|After her arrest, she {{was allowed}} to retire early from the LAPD; she {{was held in the}} Los Angeles County Jail. A bail hearing was not held for almost six months. Judge Robert J. Perry {{surprised}} both sides when he set the amount at $10 million in cash, well above what <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> suggested and more than twice what prosecutors had proposed. The case against her was very strong, he said, and thus she might well be at risk to flee the country or obtain weapons through her husband. Lazarus' lawyer, Mark Overland, said the judge did not understand the case well and contrasted the high figure with the $1 million set for Robert Blake and Phil Spector when they were charged with murder. Several months later, her brother claimed she was not receiving adequate treatment for an unspecified cancer while in custody, either.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{going to}} the playoffs from 1979 through 1982 and playing in two AFC Championship Games, the Chargers never went to the Super Bowl under Fouts (although they went 7 years after his retirement). Usually this is {{attributed}} to poor defense and their unwillingness to run the ball. In Fouts's prime the defense was not as stellar, but the running game became far better {{with the addition of}} Chuck Muncie, traded from New Orleans in 1980, and the drafting of James Brooks from Auburn in 1981. It is believed <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> little opportunity to improve as the offense often scored quickly, leaving the defense to spend far too much time on the field. It also hurt that Fred Dean, an All-Pro sack specialist, was traded away to the San Francisco 49ers in 1981 in a contract dispute, and Dean would win UPI NFC Defensive Player of the Year (while playing in only 11 games) that year en route to a Super Bowl victory and help the 49ers to another Super Bowl title three years later. Dean would later be inducted into the Hall of Fame.|$|E
25|$|Between 1972 and 1976, Collins appealed {{his murder}} {{conviction}} on four further occasions; citing contentions that the Michigan Murders had received extensive media publicity in Washtenaw County, and that five separate motions for {{change of venue}} had been submitted by the defense counsel (two {{of which had been}} filed throughout the actual jury selection process) upon the grounds of pretrial publicity minimizing any chance of obtaining an unbiased jury in Washtenaw County. Each motion filed had been reserved or, in the final instance, denied. His lawyers further argued that, at an evidentiary hearing in April 1970, shortly before jury selection had begun, Collins' indictment for the California murder of Roxie Ann Phillips had likewise received extensive media coverage in Washtenaw County—further reducing the chances of potential jurors being unbiased. Moreover, a psychologist retained by <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> testified as such on April 20, 1970. This psychologist had been adamant that Collins' trial should be held outside Washtenaw County, and this motion had likewise been reserved. Furthermore, Collins' lawyers argued issues such as the admissibility of testimony relating to the microscopic analysis of hair samples presented at his trial, and the denial of defense motions to suppress prosecution witnesses testifying against their client.|$|E

25|$|It {{emerged during}} the {{cross-examination}} of Fung and the other laboratory scientists that the police scientist Andrea Mazzola (who collected blood samples from Simpson to compare with evidence from the crime scene) was a trainee who carried the vial of Simpson's blood around in her lab coat pocket for nearly a day before handing it over as an exhibit. While two errors {{had been found in}} the history of DNA testing at Cellmark, one of the testing laboratories, in 1988 and 1989, the errors were found during quality control tests and had not occurred since. One of the companies hired for DNA consulting by Simpson's defense had made the same error as found in 1988. What should have been the prosecution's strong point became their weak link, amid defense accusations that police technicians handled the blood samples with such a degree of incompetence as to render the delivery of accurate and reliable DNA results almost impossible. The prosecution argued that they had made the DNA evidence available to the defense for its own testing, and if the defense attorneys disagreed with the prosecution's tests, they could have conducted their own testing on the same samples. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> chosen not to accept the prosecution's offer.|$|E
500|$|The {{second game}} of 2015 against the Packers {{was held on}} Thanksgiving Day in Green Bay. The two teams, in their 190th meeting, had never played {{each other on the}} holiday; in Thanksgiving games, the Bears were 16–15–2, while the Packers were 14–19–2. Chicago's offense took on a defense that ranked second in the league in first quarter points allowed with 1.9, along with a defense that {{recorded}} six sacks in week eleven against Minnesota. Jeff Joniak added that the offense had to improve its red zone performance; against Denver, the Bears failed to score on three of the four trips to the red zone, leading to a 41.2 percent touchdown efficiency in 2015; in ten games, the Bears were only able to score 14 touchdowns within the 20-yard line. On the other side, Joniak stated <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> to stop the Packers offense early; since 2014, the Packers had outscored opponents 151–27 at Lambeau, while also leading the league in first quarter points with an average of 7.6. Aaron Rodgers had thrown eight first quarter touchdown passes (the most in the NFL) in 2015, while the Packers had a league-best +57 scoring differential. Meanwhile, the Bears defense had allowed nine touchdowns in the first, though <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> not given up a touchdown in the third quarter. Joniak also wrote that the Bears had to [...] "match and surpass the emotion" [...] on a night that featured Brett Favre's jersey retirement [...] "with their most physical, error-free and consistent performance". Eddie Royal, Ka'Deem Carey, Martellus Bennett, Antrel Rolle, cornerback Jacoby Glenn, Nick Becton and Will Sutton were inactive.|$|E

A number of setbacks plagued the defense, including the May 6 suicide of Wise's sister-in-law, Edith Hasel, and the subsequent collapse of her husband Fred Hasel, both of whom had been prepared to testify for the defense; the recantation of testimony by a man named Frank Metzger, who told the prosecution on cross-examination that <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> asked him to perjure himself to support claims that Wise was insane; and Wise's choice to take the stand on her own behalf. Family members including Wise's son, Lester, and three of the Gienkes' children testified against her.|$|E
