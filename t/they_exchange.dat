5|$|Before going {{hunting the}} next day Bertilak proposes a bargain: he will give Gawain {{whatever}} he catches {{on the condition that}} Gawain give him whatever he might gain during the day. Gawain accepts. After Bertilak leaves, Lady Bertilak visits Gawain's bedroom and behaves seductively, but despite her best efforts he yields nothing but a single kiss in his unwillingness to offend her. When Bertilak returns and gives Gawain the deer he has killed, his guest gives a kiss to Bertilak without divulging its source. The next day the lady comes again, Gawain again courteously foils her advances, and later that day there is a similar exchange of a hunted boar for two kisses. She comes once more on the third morning, this time offering Gawain a gold ring as a keepsake. He gently but steadfastly refuses but she pleads that he at least take her belt, a girdle of green and gold silk which, the lady assures him, is charmed and will keep him from all physical harm. Tempted, as he may otherwise die {{the next day}}, Gawain accepts it, and <b>they</b> <b>exchange</b> three kisses.

25|$|Dark Tournament is a {{fighting}} game {{that relies on}} a proprietary combat system. The player is able to move within a straight line on a 3D arena. The purpose of each battle is to deplete an opponent’s health while maintaining one’s own, although a participant may win by forcing an opponent out of the ring. Each of the game’s 25 player characters has {{a specific set of}} basic punches, kicks, blocks, throws, and combo moves. In addition, a meter located below each fighter's health will fill as <b>they</b> <b>exchange</b> hits with each other; characters have access to powerful “spirit” attacks once this meter fills to capacity. Dark Tournament features a story mode which is divided into 31 chapters, progressing linearly through the plot of the manga and anime. The mode features different objectives relating to the narrative. For instance, one chapter requires the player to trade blows with the drunken master Chu in a match that restricts either character from moving or dodging. Other chapters allow the player to use multiple characters in battle with a tag team system.|$|E
