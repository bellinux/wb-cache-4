5|$|After a {{successful}} first contest, the second faced several location problems. <b>The</b> <b>event</b> originally {{should have been}} organised by British broadcaster ITV in Manchester. ITV then announced that due to financial and scheduling reasons, the contest would not {{take place in the}} United Kingdom after all. It is also thought that another factor to their decision was the previous years' audience ratings for ITV which were below the expected amount. The EBU approached Croatian broadcaster HRT, who had won the previous contest, to stage <b>the</b> <b>event</b> in Zagreb; though it later emerged that HRT had 'forgotten' to book the venue in which the contest would have taken place. It was at this point, with five months remaining until <b>the</b> <b>event</b> would be held, that Norwegian broadcaster NRK stepped in to host the contest in Lillehammer.|$|E
5|$|After the incident, <b>the</b> <b>event</b> {{was halted}} for 15 minutes, until Vince McMahon and other WWF Corporate {{officials}} {{made the decision}} to continue <b>the</b> <b>event.</b> Hart's coworkers, professional wrestlers, and other miscellaneous workers, appeared somber after Hart's fall as they continued to do their jobs. An hour after <b>the</b> <b>event</b> restarted, Ross informed pay-per-view viewers that Hart had {{died at the age of}} 34 at a nearby hospital. The fans in attendance were not told any information about what had happened to Hart, and they did not hear the announcement of his death.|$|E
5|$|After the {{previous}} German Grand Prix (at the Nürburgring) in July 2009, {{the future of}} the race was in doubt after the government of Baden-Württemberg and the town of Hockenheim withdrew their funding for <b>the</b> <b>event.</b> Planned discussions between the owner of Formula One's commercial rights Bernie Ecclestone and the Minister-President of Baden-Württemberg Günther Oettinger to renegotiate the expenses for hosting <b>the</b> <b>event</b> had ended after Ecclestone made controversial comments regarding Adolf Hitler, and the organisers of the Nürburgring circuit announced that they would not hold the race in 2010 because of a commitment to hold <b>the</b> <b>event</b> the following year. An agreement was reached in September which would see <b>the</b> <b>event</b> run until 2018 with both circuit's management and Formula One Management agreeing to cover any losses incurred.|$|E

He contacted several people, including The Sandman, Sabu, Justin Credible, and ECW commentator Joey Styles. Reports later stated that Paul Heyman was working with Dreamer to help prepare <b>the</b> <b>event.</b> Other ECW related wrestlers were later added to the pay-per-view. <b>The</b> <b>event</b> was publicly confirmed by WWE through a Dish Network magazine in March 2005.
