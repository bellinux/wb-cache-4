5|$|Star Trek has led {{directly}} or indirectly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of magazines which focus either on science fiction or specifically on Star Trek.

5|$|By 1661, Copenhagen had {{asserted}} {{its position}} as capital of Denmark and Norway. All the major institutions were located there, {{as was the}} fleet {{and most of the}} army. The defences were further enhanced with the completion of the Citadel in 1664 and the extension of Christianshavns Vold with its bastions in 1692, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new base for the fleet at Nyholm.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{appear in}} the Radstock district, and surrounding Somerset Coalfield (largely concealed by Triassic and newer rocks). There are two series of coal-bearing sandstones and shales separated by Pennant Sandstone. Locally the beds are folded and faulted. There were mines in the Radstock and Nailsea areas but these have closed. This {{was one of the}} first areas in the world to undergo systematic geological study and mapping by John Strachey and William Smith in the 18th century. They observed the rock layers, or strata, which led Smith <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> testable hypothesis, which he termed the Principle of Faunal Succession.|$|E

5|$|During the {{preparation}} of the new constitution for West Germany, discussions regarding its national symbols took place in August 1948 during a meeting at Herrenchiemsee. Although there were objections <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> national flag before reunification with the east, it was decided to proceed. This decision was primarily motivated by the proposed constitution by the eastern SED in November 1946, where black-red-gold were suggested as the colours for a future German republic.|$|E
5|$|However, Prime Minister Churchill was not {{satisfied}} with Ironside's progress, especially with regard <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mobile reserve. Anthony Eden, the Secretary of State for War, suggested that Ironside should be replaced by General Brooke (later Viscount Alanbrooke). On 17 July 1940 Churchill spent an afternoon with Brooke and was soon convinced {{that they were in}} close agreement as to how best to defend the nation. On 19 July Brooke replaced Ironside.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s Bradbury {{oversaw the}} {{development}} of thermonuclear weapons, although a falling out with Edward Teller over the priority given to their development led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rival nuclear weapons laboratory, the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. In later years, he branched out, constructing the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility to develop the laboratory's role in nuclear science, and during the Space Race of the 1960s, the laboratory developed the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA). The Bradbury Science Museum is named in his honor.|$|E

5|$|The 19th century saw major {{development}} in healthcare in Arbroath. In 1836 a dispensary {{was set up}} by public subscription to provide medical care for the poor. In 1842 a typhus epidemic in the town led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small fever ward to keep patients in isolation. The following year subscriptions began to be taken to develop this into Arbroath Infirmary, which opened in 1845, and moved to new premises in 1916.|$|E
5|$|The Economist {{recalled}} how the Soviet Union prevented Andrei Sakharov from accepting his Nobel Peace Prize in 1975, {{and suggested that}} Chinese leadership would probably have expected such a comparison. Both it and Die Welt made direct reference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> similar German National Prize for Art and Science by Nazi Germany after von Ossietzky was prohibited from leaving the country to collect the 1935 prize.|$|E
5|$|The M-43 {{designation}} {{dates back}} to at least July 1, 1919, when it was used {{on a series of}} roadways running between Kalamazoo and St. Charles. Its northern- and easternmost sections were transferred to other highways in the 1930s. Additions to M-43 extended it to its current termini. Several sections of the highway were realigned during its history, one of these changes led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> business loop in Grand Ledge. Another former segment of the trunkline in the Lansing area has been renumbered M-143.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} Germanicus in dubious {{circumstances}} greatly affected Tiberius' popularity in Rome, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> climate {{of fear in}} Rome itself.

5|$|The {{expansion}} of Toronto in the east, in the 19th century, {{led to the}} development of housing stock along the Kingston Road and Danforth Road corridors in Scarborough. This led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transit line. In 1893, the Toronto and Scarboro' Electric Railway, Light and Power Company built a single-track radial line along Kingston Road to Blantyre. Over the next 13 years this was extended to West Hill. In 1904, the line became the Scarboro Division of the Toronto and York Radial Railway. Service continued along this line until 1936 when it was replaced by bus service.|$|E
5|$|A {{rerouting}} of trunklines in 1941 lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Business US12 (BUS US12). M-96 ran concurrently with BUS US12 and M-37 was truncated to end at M-96. US12 was rerouted between Galesburg and Kalamazoo in 1954, and M-96 {{was extended}} along the former US12 routing {{to end in}} Kalamazoo. M-96 was rerouted in downtown Battle Creek to one-way streets in 1958, and BUS US12/M-96 was extended {{by the end of}} the decade when the I-94/US12 freeway was completed in the area. BUS US12 was redesignated as Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) in 1960 and M-96 was shortened to end at BL I-94/M-78 running on Capital Avenue. M-37 was reextended in 1961 in Battle Creek to a concurrent routing with M-96 in 1961.|$|E

The season also features the return of Soundwave and Ratchet from Transformers: Primethe former appearing for one episode while the latter appears in the two-part finale. A miniseries, {{consisting of}} six episodes, premiered in October 2016 and features the return of Starscream, placing him as the main antagonist. In April 2017, the series' third season, entitled Combiner Force, began airing and focuses on Bee Team's realization that they can combine into the Combiner, Ultra Bee, {{as well as the}} arrival of the Stunticons, who are also capable of combining. Soundwave also plans to return with the help of Activators, a new breed of Minicons.|$|E

5|$|In the 17th century, {{the area}} was {{inhabited}} by the Seneca at the village of Ganatsekwyagon, who were later displaced by the Mississaugas, who were themselves displaced by the settlers who began to arrive in the late 18th century. After the land was surveyed in 1793, it was opened to settlement by British subjects with {{the first issue of}} land patents in 1796, although squatters had already been present for a few years. The first settlers were David and Andrew Thomson. They were stonemasons who worked on the first parliament buildings for York. They each built mills. This activity led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small village known as the Thomson Settlement. The first post office opened in 1832, in Scarborough Village.|$|E
