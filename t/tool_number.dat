40|$|We {{propose a}} {{framework}} of self-aware machines based on data collected using the MTConnect protocol. Beyond exist-ing applications of OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) reporting, the proposed framework integrates multiple sources of information for work-piece and machine condition moni-toring, and equipment time to failure prediction in manufac-turing processes, and provides feedback to shop supervisor. Firstly, we propose a method to predict component wear and failure based on operational data. ICP (Interactive Closest Point) algorithm is used {{to find the best}} matching tool path given a certain <b>tool</b> <b>number</b> to identify similar machining pro-cesses. The result of ICP tool path matching, together with other parameters such as spindle speed, feed rate and <b>tool</b> <b>number,</b> are used to adaptively cluster the machining pro-cesses. For each process cluster, a particle filter based prog-nostic algorithm is used to predict tool wear and/or spindle bearing failure. Secondly, we propose to use anomaly detec-tion methods to detect changes in normal behavior of the ma-chines. Various machine learning algorithms are utilized to detect anomalies based on real-time data, and a voting mech-anism is used to decide when to trigger an alarm. Thirdly, the axes traverse is aggregated to provide a measure of the wear on various axes in the machine, which is correlated to errors in position comparing to the commanded positions and nominal tool paths. Spindle load verse rotating speed is also examined to facilitate shop floor scheduling to avoid damage caused by unintentionally excessive machine usage.

To answer this we have chosen a qualitative method and have done interviews with twelve preschool teachers, six in preschool and six in kindergarten. We base our study on the following question: How do preschool teachers in preschool and kindergarten describe their work with children’s creative activity? The result of the study didn’t show any difference between kindergarten and preschool. They both consider that creative activity is important for children’s learning and development.

40|$|Abstract. Reversible {{cutting method}} {{is a new}} {{research}} thesis proposed to shorten processing route, decrease <b>tool</b> <b>number</b> and handling time, increase machining efficiency. The aim of the presented work was to analysis the effects of reversible fine machining sequence on surface integrity in machined layer. Nonlinear hardening during reverse loading and the change of the Bauschinger effect factor with plastic strain were properly taken into account. In experiments, the residual stresses have been measured using the X-ray diffraction technique (at {{the surface of the}} workpiece and in depth). Moreover, micro-hardness and surface roughness of machined surface are presented. Experimental data for the range of cutting parameters tested showed that the reversible fine machining produce the tensile residual stresses at the surface, which are critical in the performance of the machined components. The experimental results of micro-hardness of reversible fine machining technique are smaller than that of general fine machining show that decreased plastic deformation of the surface layer and work-hardening. Surface roughness of machined surface with reversible finishing is discussed. Research results indicted that it can be adopted such planning which rough machining during advance stroke and fine machining or semi-finishing during return stroke in machining process. In this way, it has such advantages that increase machining efficiency and machining accuracy, decrease bending deformation...|$|E
40|$|There are 441 {{journals}} on the Hrčak portal. They {{cover all}} disciplines {{and are available}} in open access. We send an online questionnaire to editors of all dhe journals. The questions were about: acceptance rate, peer review type, instructions for peer reviewers, automated peer review <b>tool,</b> <b>number</b> of reviewers in journal’s database, duration of peer review process, implementation of international recommendations on peer review, about ethical issues, publishing submission and/or acceptance dates, editorial freedom and integrity etc. The data was collected from February to June 2017. Results show that most journals from the fields of {{humanities and social sciences}} conduct double blind peer review, and journals from other fields (biotechnology, technology, medicine, science) mostly conduct single blind peer review. Editors are in general very satisfied with the quality of the submitted reviews. Peer reviewers meet the deadlines, but it is not always easy to find competent peer reviewers. In about 10 % of journals peer reviewers have to declare conflict of interest. Eighty percent of journals publish detailed instructions for peer reviewers and 43 % of journals explain ethical issues in the instructions. Open peer review is not accepted in Croatian journals and some editors are not familiar with the concept of open peer review. Only 7 % of the editors strongly agree that open peer review would enhance the peer review quality. Automated publishing systems (such as Open Journals System) are becoming more popular if compared to previous researches. When asked about process of acceptance, editors claim that mean number of days from submission to publishing decision is about 140. Journals from the field of humanities and social sciences have acceptance rate around 45 %, and from the other fields around 35 %. In conclusion, we can say that majority of journals have high level of editorial freedom and integrity but {{there is a need to}} raise awareness of the new forms of peer review as well as of the importance of the transparent guidelines for the reviewers...|$|E
