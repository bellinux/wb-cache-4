5|$|A danger <b>to</b> <b>agriculture</b> is wheat rust, a {{pathogenic}} fungus causing reddish patches, coloured by its spores. A virulent form of {{the wheat}} disease, stem rust, strain Ug99, spread from Africa across to the Arabian Peninsula by 2007. In field trials in Kenya, more than 85% of wheat samples, including major cultivars, were susceptible, implying that higher crop diversity was required. The Nobel laureate Norman Borlaug argued for action to ensure global food security.|$|E

Prey items recorded for the Mascarene martin include scarab, click and other beetles, Hemiptera and flying ants, and Brazza's martins will take termites. In eastern Africa, areas deforested by logging or conversion <b>to</b> <b>agriculture</b> are used for hunting by Brazza's martins.|$|E

The Philippine Red Cross reported that 207people died on land in the Philippines, which was slightly lower than the agency's earlier reports suggesting a death toll of 233.

Although Nora was significantly weakened, near hurricane-force winds were observed at the Dixie National Forest in southwestern Utah, where strong gusts sheared off the tops of large trees.|$|E

5|$|Overall, high {{temperature}} {{is the most}} common problem in the Little Butte Creek watershed. This is most likely caused by water diversion and depleted riparian zones. Approximately 53percent of riparian zones in the watershed are damaged due <b>to</b> <b>agriculture</b> or deforestation, while 43percent are classified as healthy. Another threat to healthy riparian zones are invasive blackberries, which crowd out native vegetation and provide little shade. The resulting higher water temperatures can be very harmful to anadromous fish. High concentration of bacteria is also an issue.|$|E
