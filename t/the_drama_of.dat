25|$|The {{story is}} told by a narrator (a lightly fictionalized version of Pushkin's public image), whose tone is educated, worldly, and intimate.

25|$|Later on, Novo Ecijanos would {{continue}} to participate in <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> <b>of</b> war, revolution and the fight for freedom.

25|$|His congressional {{speeches and}} {{published}} writings demonstrate {{the central role}} that Morgan played in <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> <b>of</b> racial politics on Capitol Hill and in the national press from 1889 to 1891. More importantly, they reveal his leadership in forging the ideology of white supremacy that dominated American race relations from the 1890s to the 1960s. Indeed, Morgan emerged as the most prominent and notorious racist ideologue of his day, a man who, {{as much as any}} other individual, {{set the tone for the}} coming Jim Crow era.|$|E
25|$|The {{series was}} filmed on Super 16, {{rather than the}} more {{commonly}} used digital alternatives. Episodes were originally aired with no credits on BBC One, a choice made to maintain an atmosphere of the anonymity of real-life spies and <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> <b>of</b> each episode. Prior to Series 9, the subsequent episode was aired on BBC Three one week ahead of its BBC One showing (the first and last episode were only shown on BBC One). BBC Three airings included a brief credit sequence following the trailer and before the Kudos and BBC logos.|$|E

25|$|At {{the height}} of the People Power Revolution, {{military}} reformists, believing that television would be a powerful tool to aid the revolution, attacked and took over the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center. On February 24, 1986, former ABS-CBN talents put the station back on the air and televised <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> <b>of</b> the unfolding uprising, thereby contributing to the strength of the revolt. BBC-2, on the other hand, ceased operations after reformists shut down its transmitter on the following day as Channel 2 frequency was turned over to the Lopezes on July 16, 1986.|$|E
25|$|Thirdly, his {{integration}} of Italian styles with the German tradition he was trained in is perhaps {{more effective than}} that of any Northern painter since Dürer (with the exception of his friend Rubens). His compositions tend to underplay <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> <b>of</b> the events they depict (in noticeable contrast to those of Rubens), but often show the start of moments of transformation. His figures are relatively short and stocky, and reflect little of classical ideals. Their poses and gestures are unflamboyant, and their facial expressions resemble those in Early Netherlandish painting rather than the bella figura of most Italian Renaissance work.|$|E
25|$|Eclipse {{continues}} <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> <b>of</b> Bella and Edward's relationship. Edward {{explains that}} he is reluctant to change Bella into a vampire because he believes that vampires are soulless creatures who {{have no place in}} heaven. Bella, whose opinion of marriage is jaded by her own parents' early divorce, agrees to marry Edward on the condition that he will make love with her while she is still human and then turn her into a vampire. He initially refuses, saying that he could easily lose control {{in the heat of the}} moment and unintentionally kill her. However, seeing how important it is to Bella, he agrees to try, but only after they are married.|$|E

25|$|The {{first result}} of the new {{thinking}} was Gluck's reformist ballet Don Juan, but a more important work was soon to follow. On 5 October 1762, Orfeo ed Euridice was given its first performance, with music by Gluck to words by Calzabigi. The dances were arranged by Angiolini and the title role was taken by Guadagni. Orfeo, which has never left the standard repertory, showed the beginnings of Gluck's reforms. His idea was to make <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> <b>of</b> the work {{more important than the}} star singers who performed it, and to do away with dry recitative (recitativo secco, accompanied only by continuo) that broke up the action. The more flowing and dramatic style which resulted has been seen as a precursor to the music dramas of Richard Wagner.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> <b>of</b> 1936, the 1937 and 1938 seasons were quiet ones for Gimblett. Other batsmen {{of his own}} age, such as Leonard Hutton, moved ahead {{of him in the}} Test pecking order, and he was at times not fully fit. He completed 1000 runs easily in both seasons and there were occasional innings of brilliance: at Wells in 1937, he made 141 in 150 minutes with nine sixes and 16 fours against Hampshire. In 1938, Wisden noted that he was, at times, more defensive than he had been previously, and in run-getting he was overshadowed by his opening partner, Frank Lee, who scored more than 2,000 runs in the season. For some matches in 1938, Gimblett batted at No 4, Bertie Buse opening with Lee.|$|E
25|$|American Idol {{was based}} on the British show Pop Idol created by Simon Fuller, which was in turn {{inspired}} by the New Zealand television singing competition Popstars. Television producer Nigel Lythgoe saw a version in Australia and helped bring it over to Britain. Fuller was inspired by the idea from Popstars of employing a panel of judges to select singers in audition. He then added other elements, including telephone voting by the viewing public (which, at the time, was already in use in shows, such as the Eurovision Song Contest), <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> <b>of</b> backstories, and real-life soap opera unfolding in real time. The show debuted in Britain in 2001 with Lythgoe as showrunnerthe executive producer and production leaderand Simon Cowell as one of the judges, and was successful with the viewing public.|$|E
