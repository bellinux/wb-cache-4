5|$|After being {{questioned}} sharply, Đính quickly became angry. Ray Herndon of United Press International {{asked him to}} name the country that he was referring to, but Đính dodged the question. Herndon lampooned him by saying that a national hero {{should be able to}} identify the national enemy, and asked him to call Madame Nhu, the de facto First Lady known for her anti-American comments, to get help in identifying the hostile country in question. After several reporters derisively laughed at <b>these</b> <b>comments,</b> Đính stormed out of the conference.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the issues}} with the {{publishing}} of Killing Time, there was increased oversight by Roddenberry's staff regarding the novels published by Pocket Books. This was delegated to Arnold, and would later cause confusion for Pocket Books as comments would be sent back and it was sometimes unclear whether they were from Roddenberry or Arnold. <b>These</b> <b>comments</b> rejected plot developments in the novels where they were {{stepping out of the}} bounds set by the television series. Rumours subsequently spread that there was an alternative version of the manuscript with more explicit Kirk/Spock slash details, something that Van Hise later denied.|$|E

25|$|During a {{majority}} of the final campaigning, the attacks between the Clinton campaign and the Obama campaign highly intensified by the candidates as well as the media coverage.

He warned of a 'tsunami coming' due the governing bodies' failure to address issues surrounding new golf technology. After the 2017 Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, Player reiterated <b>these</b> <b>comments,</b> taking to Twitter to say he was 'sad' to see the Old Course at St Andrews 'brought to her knees' after Ross Fisher broke the course record on a day of very low scoring during the final round.|$|E
25|$|The speech Johnston {{delivered}} on August 14, 2011, to the Canadian Bar Association's {{annual meeting in}} Halifax, Nova Scotia, attracted media attention for its criticism of the legal profession: the Governor General lamented unnecessary and deliberate legal delays across Canada, the role of unscrupulous American lawyers in the unfolding of the global financial crisis, and said the profession was losing the public's trust. <b>These</b> <b>comments</b> were noted for being unusually controversial for a viceroy, but Johnston's colleagues and {{the editorial board of}} The Globe and Mail found the Governor General's words to be both unsurprising and welcome.|$|E

25|$|Subtleties in, and an {{imperfect}} scholarly understanding of, high Nahuatl rhetorical style make the exact intent of <b>these</b> <b>comments</b> tricky to ascertain, but Restall argues that Moctezuma's politely offering his throne to Cortés (if indeed he did ever give the speech as reported) {{may well have}} been meant as the exact opposite of what it was taken to mean: politeness in Aztec culture was a way to assert dominance and show superiority. This speech, which has been widely referred to, has been a factor in the widespread belief that Moctezuma was addressing Cortés as the returning god Quetzalcoatl.|$|E
25|$|Through Cambridge and Bloomsbury, Young had {{a longstanding}} {{friendship}} with E.M. Forster. Suffering writer’s block {{while working on}} A Passage to India, the novelist was Young’s guest at the Lacket in early May 1922. Shortly afterwards he wrote to Young declaring, “an unfinished novel’s before me now, and sometimes I work at it with distaste and despair…You certainly have done more than any individual I know to help me by direct remarks. Your knowledge {{of the business of}} creating seemed to me profounder than that possessed by so-called artists.” <b>These</b> <b>comments</b> suggest that Young gave Forster significant advice and encouragement at a crucial stage on work on the latter’s eventual masterpiece.|$|E
25|$|If <b>these</b> <b>comments</b> were, indeed, {{spoken by}} Mr. Pelini, we are {{extremely}} disappointed, {{but it only}} reaffirms the decision that he should {{no longer be a}} leader of young men at Nebraska. His habitual use of inappropriate language, and his personal and professional attacks on administrators, are antithetical to the values of our university. His behavior is consistent with a pattern of unprofessional, disrespectful behavior directed by Mr. Pelini toward the passionate fans of Nebraska, employees of the university and, most concerning, our student-athletes. This behavior is not tolerated at the University of Nebraska and, among many other concerns, played a role in his dismissal.|$|E

25|$|Allen Leech, {{who plays}} Tom Branson in the series, {{when asked about}} this by an Irish {{reporter}} writing for The Herald, denied that the series depicted Irish characters in a stage pejorative fashion. Tom's brother Kieran, however, is depicted as boorish, rude, and drunken, and is described by the Dowager Countess as a 'drunken gorilla'—a reminder to Irish audiences of the ape-like figures depicting the Irish that were commonly featured in British and American publications in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

This later triggered an international hockey dispute, when a column was posted on IIHF.com regarding <b>these</b> <b>comments</b> and about players' turning down invitations to attend.

He appealed his conviction to the Arkansas Supreme Court, and that court reaffirmed the conviction. The court held that Mr. Elders failed to show that he was entrapped into making the narcotics sale.
