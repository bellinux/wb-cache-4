5|$|One of Jorge Luis Borges' earlier {{editorial}} jobs was for Urbe, {{a promotional}} magazine for the underground system which was privately owned at <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> magazine, he wrote several articles on sci-fi topics under various pseudonyms.|$|E
5|$|Asch {{began his}} {{teaching}} career at Brooklyn College. In 1947, {{he moved to}} Swarthmore College, where he stayed for 19 years (1947-1966). Swarthmore was the major center for scholars of Gestalt psychology at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. Wolfgang Kohler, a German immigrant; W. C. H. Prentice, and Hans Wallach were faculty members at that time as well.|$|E
5|$|Bandslam was {{slated to}} be {{released}} in standard DVD and Blu-ray in the UK on December 7, 2009. However, due to unknown circumstances, UK label E1 Entertainment were unable to release the film on Blu-ray at <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> United States, the DVD was released on March 16, 2010. In the rest of Europe, the DVD was also released between December 2009 and June 2010.|$|E

5|$|Basil II was at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern {{provinces of}} his empire, {{wintering}} {{on the plain}} of Tarsus following his campaign against the Fatimid dynasty in Syria. On hearing of David’s death he marched north-eastward to claim the lands David had promised to the emperor. The local Georgian and Armenian nobility submitted without any serious resistance. The only notable incident occurred when a quarrel between a Georgian soldier and a Varangian Guardsman over a bale of hay developed into a major fight, involving 6,000 Varangians and taking the lives of thirty Georgian high-ranking nobles.|$|E
5|$|Earp's {{anger at}} Holliday's ethnic slur may {{indicate}} that his feelings for Josephine were more serious at the time than is commonly known. The information in the letter is compelling because at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1940s, the relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus in Tombstone was not public knowledge. Otero could know these things only {{if he had a}} relationship with someone who had personal knowledge of the individuals involved.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of the war to mid-1941, Coastal Command had only one {{functioning}} Operational Training Unit (OTU). Officially it had to provide training for 17 units. The pressure on the OTU was such that it offered little more than a conversion programme for pilots and crews hoping to man land-based aircraft. In 1940, Bomber Command was asked to support Coastal forces, even though at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war it overstretched itself. Requests to the Air Ministry to meet outstanding OTU requirements were largely ignored. The single landplane OTU was established to train 1.1 crews per month. This figure, on the outbreak of war, proved grossly inadequate.|$|E
50|$|Fisgard Lighthouse {{was built}} in 1860 to guide vessels through the {{entrance}} of Esquimalt harbour. It was named after HMS Fisgard, a British Navy ship <b>that</b> spent <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific..|$|R

50|$|Bolton Street {{was built}} around 1696 and {{named after the}} Duke of Bolton for whom {{sewerage}} pipes were being laid to his home nearby at <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> 1708 <b>the</b> street was <b>the</b> westernmost <b>in</b> London.|$|R
5|$|History of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1648) {{covers a}} period {{in the history of}} Poland and Lithuania, before their joint state was {{subjected}} to devastating wars {{in the middle of the}} 17th century. The Union of Lublin of 1569 established the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, a more closely unified federal state, replacing the previously existing personal union of the two countries. The Union was largely run by the Polish and increasingly Polonized Lithuanian and Ruthenian nobility, through the system of the central parliament and local assemblies, but from 1573 led by elected kings. The formal rule of the proportionally more numerous than in other European countries nobility constituted a sophisticated early democratic system, in contrast to the absolute monarchies prevalent at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rest of Europe.|$|E
5|$|Love in Several Masques was Fielding's first play, and {{was first}} {{released}} on 16 February 1728. Though {{the play was}} never revived and only ran for four nights, it still did moderately well especially {{when compared with the}} competing plays at <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> play, three respectable males each meet a female counterpart three times, and share a parallel incident with letters and an unmasking. Fielding focuses on men and how he believes they should prove their worth before marriage. It also highlights Fielding's belief in the relationship of morality and libertine beliefs and introduces character types that Fielding would use throughout his plays and novels.|$|E
5|$|Marcus {{continued}} {{throughout his}} tenure to hold tightly to his father's assurance {{that he would}} be able to maintain and act on his political convictions while running the business. He supported the United Nations in its early years, an unpopular position in Dallas for <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 1950s he began to explore the ramifications of ending the store's participation in the then-common practice of excluding black customers from shopping in the store, and while his legal advisors cautioned against that step, he offered support for any black entrepreneur looking to establish a quality store and, in 1954, began to hire black staff in some departments.|$|E
50|$|After mistaking Cliffjumper for his universe's Cliffjumper, Megatron mistakenly {{believed}} <b>that</b> his <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rad Zone had damaged his circuitry, {{and noted}} that perhaps they should have Shockwave {{take a look at}} him.|$|R
50|$|He was capped three <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> German {{national}} team and before <b>that</b> four <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East German {{national team}}. He made his debut for East Germany against <b>the</b> United States <b>in</b> East Berlin in March 1990.|$|R
5|$|According to the 11th century Domesday survey, Benedictine Muchelney owned Muchelney, Midelney and Thorney islands. At <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1086 <b>the</b> abbey paid a tax of 6,000 eels a year caught {{from the}} local rivers and marshes.|$|R
5|$|Pleistocene {{climate is}} harder to determine, though it was {{probably}} not much wetter than today, except in the mountains where precipitation increased. Drainage changes in the Colorado River Delta probably account {{for most of the}} water budget increases responsible for the formation of Lake Cahuilla. In the Mojave Desert large lakes also formed during <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early Holocene the North American Monsoon strongly influenced the local climate and then progressively weakened.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} cruck {{hall was}} replaced by the present Great Hall in 1512, after Sir Alexander Radclyffe was appointed High Sheriff of Lancashire. The hall is typical of others built at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northwest of England, although {{it is one of the}} largest, and is unusual for the period in having no wall fireplace. The hall has an elaborate roof structure, as in the similar Rufford Old Hall. There is a slightly later small room above the large oriel bay, which may be an early addition as at Samlesbury Hall.|$|E
5|$|The {{registers}} of Crosthwaite Church {{stated that}} there were 238 interments in 1623, {{believed to have been}} something between a twelfth and a tenth of the whole population of the parish at <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1640s there was a sharp fall in population, brought on by the plague epidemic which affected Keswick, Carlisle, Cockermouth and Crosthwaite and other areas in 1645–47.|$|E

25|$|At these championships, {{there was}} an {{automatic}} timing system that was both on the slalom canoer's bib and on the course itself. There were a total of ten antennas on the course that once an electronic marker in a canoer's bib approaches an antenna, it triggered video camera and timing controls. These course antennas were located at the start line, the finish line, and eight points in between. This system was used as video feed for the championships. It was an automatic system <b>that</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1/100ths of a second and is uploadable on any Windows or Mac computer.|$|R
5|$|When the {{original}} state trunklines were designated, an M-11 ran {{the length of}} the Lake Michigan shoreline from the Indiana state line to Mackinaw City. That highway was replaced in 1926 by two of the then-newly created US Highways. A second highway was given the M-11 designation at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Saline area. This highway was removed from the highway system and the designation decommissioned in 1954. The current M-11 was designated in 1961 along a set of roads in the Grand Rapids area that includes portions of a former route of US Highway 16 (US16) in Michigan.|$|E
5|$|Cubitt was {{originally}} a carpenter and, like Denison senior, had acquired his wealth {{through his own}} business acumen, building up a successful company and business empire. At the time he purchased Denbies, Cubitt was nearing completion of the work on Osborne House for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on the Isle of Wight. Cubitt wanted a mansion of his own to emulate that of the neighbouring Georgian country house of Deepdene owned by the affluent Hope family of bankers and at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> possession of Henry Thomas Hope, a patron of the arts. For the practical purpose of continuing to reside in the existing house while building took place, the new mansion was constructed on a site slightly to the southwest of its predecessor, which was demolished once the new mansion was completed in 1854.|$|E
5|$|In the 1876 presidential election, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio {{defeated}} Democrat Samuel J. Tilden of New York {{in one of}} {{the most}} hotly contested presidential elections to <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nation's history. The results initially indicated a Democratic victory, but the electoral votes of several states were ardently disputed until mere days before the new president was to be inaugurated. Members of both parties in Congress agreed to convene a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which ultimately decided the race for Hayes. Payne was named to the committee at Tilden's request, but the results went against the Democrats as Hayes was declared the winner of the disputed votes. After the Commissions result, Payne joined many Democrats in attempting to delay the House proceedings in hopes of forcing a more favorable result, but was outvoted by Republicans and the Democrats who sided with Speaker Samuel J. Randall in accepting the Commission's result. The effort failed, and Hayes became president on March 4, 1877.|$|E
50|$|As Dunlop points out, the 100000 Chechens {{that were}} exiled in 1860-1864 may have {{comprised}} {{over half the}} nation at <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1896 Russian census there were only 226171 Chechens total.|$|R
50|$|Ibraimi joined Olimpija {{who were}} at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> playing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Slovenian Second League. His first season <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Slovenian capital was very successful, as Olimpija {{finished}} as league winners with Ibraimi scoring eleven goals.|$|R
25|$|After these attempts, {{other authors}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 20th century {{substituted}} electromagnetic radiation for Le Sage’s particles.

5|$|The {{capital city}} was {{completely}} {{dependent on the}} water supply systems constructed to channel and store water, ensuring a consistent supply throughout the year. The remains of these hydraulic systems have given historians {{a picture of the}} prevailing surface water distribution methods in use at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> semiarid regions of South India. Contemporary records and notes of foreign travelers describe how huge tanks were constructed by labourers. Excavations have uncovered the remains of a well-connected water distribution system existing solely within the royal enclosure and the large temple complexes (suggesting it was for the exclusive use of royalty, and for special ceremonies) with sophisticated channels using gravity and siphons to transport water through pipelines. The only structures resembling public waterworks are the remains of large water tanks that collected the seasonal monsoon water and then dried up in summer except for the few fed by springs. In the fertile agricultural areas near the Tungabhadra River, canals were dug to guide the river water into irrigation tanks. These canals had sluices that were opened and closed to control the water flow. In other areas the administration encouraged the digging of wells monitored by administrative authorities. Large tanks in the capital city were constructed with royal patronage while smaller tanks were funded by wealthy individuals to gain social and religious merit.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{began the}} 1984 season under head coach Bill Dooley, {{who at the}} time was the winningest coach in Tech history. In 1983, the Hokies had gone 92, with one of the two losses coming at the hands of No. 9 West Virginia in a nationally {{televised}} game. Tech began the 1984 season with a win against Wake Forest, but followed that by a loss against West Virginia {{in one of the most}} contentious college football rivalries in the country at <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> two weeks that followed, Tech continued to alternate wins and losses, reaching an overall record of 22 by the end of the fourth week of the season. Tech's fortunes took a turn for the better during the latter portion of the season, however, as the Hokies proceeded to win six of their final seven games before earning a bid to the 1984 Independence Bowl.|$|E
5|$|What Maisie Knew premiered at the 2012 Toronto Film Festival on September 7, 2012. Millennium Films {{purchased}} the film's U.S. distribution rights soon after its premiere. The film {{was released in}} the United States on May 3, 2013. Opening in a single theater in New York, it earned $21,480 on its opening weekend and $31,152 {{by the end of}} its first week. It expanded to three theaters in its second week of release, was playing in 27 theaters by its fourth week, and reached its widest release of 122 theaters in its sixth week. It was in release for a total of thirteen weeks and grossed $1,066,471 in <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom, the film was released by Curzon Film World in cinemas and through video on demand (VOD) services on August 23, 2013, with £150,000 pledged by the British Film Institute towards the film's £244,000 marketing budget. It earned £330,186 in box office revenue from four weeks of release and £65,832 from VOD rentals in the first six weeks it was available. In other territories, the film performed best in Australia (grossing US$334,651), Spain ($196,668), New Zealand ($140,696) and Brazil ($100,453).
