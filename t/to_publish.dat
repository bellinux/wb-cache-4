5|$|The {{courts have}} rarely treated {{content-based}} regulation of journalism with any sympathy. In Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo (1974), the Court unanimously {{struck down a}} state law requiring newspapers criticizing political candidates <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> their responses. The state claimed that the law had been passed to ensure journalistic responsibility. The Supreme Court found that freedom, but not responsibility, is mandated by the First Amendment and so it ruled that the government may not force newspapers <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> that which they do not desire <b>to</b> <b>publish.</b>|$|E

5|$|Between 1769 and 1773, Bellman wrote 65 of 82 of his Epistles, {{as well as}} many poems. He {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> {{the poems}} in 1772, but was unable to obtain the permission of the king, Gustav III, as a political coup intervened. He finally managed to obtain the permission in 1774, but soon discovered that the cost of printing, especially as he was determined <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> the sheet music alongside the text, was prohibitive given his ruinous finances, and he was forced to put off his plans. In 1776 the king gave him a sinecure job as secretary to the national lottery; this supported him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

5|$|Faulkner's Dublin Journal, a {{newspaper}} established in 1725, featured many articles written by Swift or inspired by writings of Swift. Between 1727 and 1730, Faulkner published many works attributed to Swift, but many were actually written by others. After 1730, {{only one of}} those works printed by Faulkner under Swift's name {{turned out to be}} written by someone besides Swift, which suggests to some critics that Swift was working with Faulkner to ensure that only authentic works were printed under Swift's name. He was the first <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> The Answer to the Craftsman, Swift's final defense of the Irish economy from England's policies. Faulkner was also the first <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> the collected Drapier's Letters as Fraud Detected on 2 October 1725.
