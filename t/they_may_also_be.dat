5|$|Demonstrative pronouns {{distinguish}} between proximate and remote. When they occur independently, they inflect for number. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> suffixed to nouns, e.g. /tabardaja/ 'this pack-saddle'.|$|E
5|$|For {{older people}} with chronic pain, opioids {{may be used}} in those for whom NSAIDs present too great a risk, {{including}} those with diabetes, stomach or heart problems. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> useful for a select group of people with neuropathic pain.|$|E
50|$|An {{associate}} specialist is {{a hospital}} doctor and is generally {{treated as a}} senior doctor. Pay is usually {{lower than that of}} a consultant (though as associate specialists sometimes have fewer duties <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> paid less overall).|$|R
50|$|Foreigners who cannot {{read and}} write in the native {{language}} where <b>they</b> live <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> considered functionally illiterate.|$|R

5|$|Whale song {{is thought}} to have an {{important}} role in mate selection; however, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> used between males to establish dominance. Polygamy has been observed in humpback whales, with the females having multiple male partners throughout their lifespan.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{gathering}} CCTV – Some ambulances are {{now being}} fitted with video cameras used to record activity either inside or outside the vehicle. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> fitted with sound recording facilities. This {{can be used as}} a form of protection from violence against ambulance crews, or in some cases (dependent on local laws) to prove or disprove cases where a member of crew stands accused of malpractice.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{supports}} {{effectiveness and}} safety in adolescents {{and those who}} have and have not previously had children. IUDs do not affect breastfeeding and can be inserted immediately after delivery. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> used immediately after an abortion. Once removed, even after long term use, fertility returns to normal immediately.|$|E
25|$|The pot-de-fer {{was used}} by the French in the Hundred Years' War in a raid on Southampton and in battles in Périgord, Cambrai, and Quesnoy. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>been</b> used against the Scottish by the English.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the 13th century, {{during the}} rule of Hindu kings, Kayasthas {{dominated}} public service and had a near-monopoly on appointments to government positions. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>been</b> described as Karanas, since the two groups performed similar functions.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{because those}} {{suffering}} with female athlete triad <b>are</b> <b>also</b> restricting their diet, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> not <b>be</b> consuming sufficient amounts {{vitamins and minerals}} which contribute to bone density; not getting enough calcium or vitamin D further exacerbates the problem of weak bones.|$|R
5|$|Some probiotics {{have been}} shown to be {{beneficial}} in reducing both the duration of illness and the frequency of stools. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> useful in preventing and treating antibiotic associated diarrhea. Fermented milk products (such as yogurt) are similarly beneficial. Zinc supplementation appears to be effective in both treating and preventing diarrhea among children in the developing world.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} cairn {{was erected}} near {{the crash site}} by the regiment in 1987. A special remembrance was held in Valemount for the 60th anniversary of the disaster in 2010. The CNR has also raised a monument {{near the site of}} the disaster. The names of the military dead are inscribed in the Korea Book of Remembrance and are also on the Wall of Remembrance in Brampton, Ontario; <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> found on the Korea Cairn at Winnipeg Brookside Cemetery. Manitoba has named a lake for Gunner William D. Wright, who died in the crash.|$|E
5|$|Attendees {{of major}} {{conventions}} receive a {{bag with the}} convention book (or conbook), a lavishly illustrated volume featuring themed artwork, fiction and articles submitted by members and the Guests of Honor, along {{with a description of}} the event's programming, staff, rules, guests and any charity being supported by the convention. Local restaurant information and a combination pocket schedule and map may also be included. Sponsors often receive additional items such as T-shirts, pins or ribbons, as well as faster registration badge pick-up and on-site meals (some conventions provide a con suite with basic refreshments for all members). <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> displayed prominently in convention publications.|$|E
50|$|Whakaeke <b>are</b> <b>also</b> choral pieces.

50|$|The islets are {{believed}} to have been named c. 1860 for Isabel ("Belle"), youngest daughter of Captain Jeremiah Nagle, then Harbourmaster for Vancouver Island. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>been</b> named after a Mr. Belle, a crewman with the Wilkes Expedition in 1841.|$|R
50|$|Zig zag stitches, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} Marriage Lines, {{can be used}} to represent the typical highs and low of matrimony and marriage life. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> used to represent the twisting cliff paths that are on the islands.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to their high biodiversity, abyssal plains are of great current and future commercial and strategic interest. For example, they {{may be used for}} the legal and illegal disposal of large structures such as ships and oil rigs, radioactive waste and other hazardous waste, such as munitions. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> attractive sites for deep-sea fishing, and extraction of oil and gas and other minerals. Future deep-sea waste disposal activities that could be significant by 2025 include emplacement of sewage and sludge, carbon-dioxide sequestration, and disposal of dredge spoils.|$|E
5|$|Listeners {{unfamiliar}} with contemporary Christian music (CCM) often assume that Loder sings hymn-style music. Her career {{is unusual in}} that it began in CCM; most young musicians choose music genres such as country and pop, which are generally considered more likely to bring commercial success. Loder has asserted that she chose CCM because it gives purpose to her music; many of her songs are about God, but <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> interpreted as being about other subjects.|$|E
5|$|The inaccessibility of its habitat affords some {{protection}} for A.bradleyi. Quarrying and strip mining may threaten the sandstone cliffs, {{especially on the}} Cumberland Plateau. Rock climbers and botanical collectors have also damaged populations of the fern. Toxic runoff from atop cliffs can affect them, and <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> threatened by both natural and anthropogenic shading of cliffs due to increased tree growth at the cliff base, invasive vines overrunning the cliff face, or the piling of slash against the cliff after logging.|$|E
25|$|Formulas to {{calculate}} {{sediment transport rate}} exist for sediment moving in several {{different parts of the}} flow. These formulas are often segregated into bed load, suspended load, and wash load. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> sometimes <b>also</b> <b>be</b> segregated into bed material load and wash load.|$|R
50|$|Nonessential {{nutrients}} {{are those}} nutrients {{that can be}} made by the body; <b>they</b> <b>may</b> often <b>also</b> <b>be</b> absorbed from consumed food. The majority of animals ultimately derive their essential nutrients from plants, though some animals may consume mineral-based soils to supplement their diet.|$|R
5000|$|The rockets {{are used}} by the Iranian Army as a regular artillery. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>been</b> {{supplied}} to Hezbollah in Lebanon under the name Khaibar-1, <b>They</b> <b>may</b> therefore have been used {{on a number of}} occasions in the 2006 Lebanon War.. The Fajr-3 <b>is</b> <b>also</b> used by the Al Quds Brigades ...|$|R
5|$|Tracheal tubes {{can be used}} {{to ensure}} the {{adequate}} exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, to deliver oxygen in higher concentrations than found in air, or to administer other gases such as helium, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, xenon, or certain volatile anesthetic agents such as desflurane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> used as a route for administration of certain medications such as bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and drugs used in treating cardiac arrest such as atropine, epinephrine, lidocaine and vasopressin.|$|E
5|$|There {{are certain}} jobs that horses do very well, and no {{technology}} has yet developed to fully replace them. For example, mounted police horses are still effective for {{certain types of}} patrol duties and crowd control. Cattle ranches still require riders on horseback to round up cattle that are scattered across remote, rugged terrain. Search and rescue organizations in some countries depend upon mounted teams to locate people, particularly hikers and children, and to provide disaster relief assistance. Horses {{can also be used}} in areas where it is necessary to avoid vehicular disruption to delicate soil, such as nature reserves. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> the only form of transport allowed in wilderness areas. Horses are quieter than motorized vehicles. Law enforcement officers such as park rangers or game wardens may use horses for patrols, and horses or mules may also be used for clearing trails or other work in areas of rough terrain where vehicles are less effective.|$|E
5|$|Vitamins have diverse {{biochemical}} functions. Some, such as vitamin D, have hormone-like {{functions as}} regulators of mineral metabolism, or regulators of cell and tissue growth and differentiation (such as {{some forms of}} vitamin A). Others function as antioxidants (e.g., vitamin E and sometimes vitamin C). The largest number of vitamins, the B complex vitamins, function as enzyme cofactors (coenzymes) or the precursors for them; coenzymes help enzymes in their work as catalysts in metabolism. In this role, vitamins may be tightly bound to enzymes as part of prosthetic groups: For example, biotin is part of enzymes involved in making fatty acids. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> less tightly bound to enzyme catalysts as coenzymes, detachable molecules that function to carry chemical groups or electrons between molecules. For example, folic acid may carry methyl, formyl, and methylene groups in the cell. Although these roles in assisting enzyme-substrate reactions are vitamins' best-known function, the other vitamin functions are equally important.|$|E
25|$|The Caudron Type D was a French pre-World War I single seat, twin-boom tractor biplane, a close but {{slightly}} smaller {{relative of the}} two seat Caudron Type C. More than a dozen were completed, one exported to the United Kingdom, where <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>been</b> licence built, and three to China.|$|R
50|$|The Xokleng or Aweikoma (sometimes called botocudos) are a Native American {{tribe of}} Brazil; their {{territory}} is located {{mainly in the}} state of Santa Catarina. They were one of the original inhabitants of the province of Misiones in Argentina. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> sometimes <b>be</b> found on the Ibirama, Posto Velho, and Rio dos Pardos reservations.|$|R
50|$|Mekhala and Kanakhala are {{depicted}} with swords held {{above their heads}} or dancing with them. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> depicted {{in the act of}} decapitation.|$|R
5|$|Bluebells are {{a species}} of {{deciduous}} woodland over much of their range, flowering and leafing early before the canopy closes in late spring. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> found growing under bracken or Japanese knotweed, perennial plants which also form stands with a dense summer canopy. They are most successful on slightly acid soils; the same niche in alkaline conditions may be occupied by other species such as Mercurialis perennis. As a species adapted to woodlands, the young shoots are able to penetrate through {{a thick layer of}} leaf litter, and bluebells are often used as an indicator species to identify ancient woodland. Bluebells are also frequently found in hedgerows, and in the west of their range they can be found growing in open habitats, including coastal meadows. Bluebell flowers are rich in pollen and nectar, and are chiefly pollinated by bumblebees, although they are also visited by various other insects. They are a host species for the parasitic fungus Uromyces muscari, which causes bluebell rust. The ability of H.non-scripta to take up phosphorus from the soil is greatly enhanced by the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizae in its roots.|$|E

5000|$|The fricatives and affricates {{shown as}} retroflex may instead be {{transcribed}} as palato-alveolar consonants with , , etc. However, {{they are more}} accurately described as retroflex, although they are laminal (like the retroflexes of Standard Chinese). <b>They</b> <b>may</b> therefore <b>also</b> <b>be</b> transcribed phonetically with the symbols [...] etc., indicating the laminal feature.|$|R
50|$|The general {{functions}} of these subtypes of mPR are: being steroid membrane receptors and binding progesterone. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> involved in oocyte maturation.|$|R
25|$|The 12 {{tree species}} are: Barringtonia asiatica (fish-poison tree), Calophyllum inophyllum (Alexandrian laurel), Cocos nucifera, Cordia subcordata, Guettarda speciosa, Intsia bijuga, Hernandia sonora, Morinda citrifolia, Neisosperma oppositifolium, Pisonia grandis, Terminalia catappa, and Heliotropium foertherianum. Another three tree species are common, and may <b>be</b> native, but <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>been</b> {{introduced}} by humans: Casuarina equisetifolia, Hibiscus tiliaceus, and Pipturus argenteus.|$|R
