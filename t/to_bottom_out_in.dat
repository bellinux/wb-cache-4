25|$|On 16 January 1944, U-66 left Lorient {{for what}} would be her last patrol and the last command of Oberleutnant zur See Gerhard Seehausen (posthumously {{promoted}} to Kapitänleutnant). A month and ten days after departure, U-66 sighted Silvermaple, a 5,313-ton British motor merchant in the convoy ST-12. She was sunk after one torpedo hit. Four days later, the boat came upon the French 5,202-ton St. Louis, which she sank with two torpedoes off Accra, Ghana. The ship broke into three parts, which sank in less than 50 seconds. Four days after the sinking of St. Louis, 'U-66 sank the 4,964-ton British John Holt with two torpedoes, and took the captain, Master Cecil Gordon Hime, and a passenger, Mr Elliott - {{an agent of the}} Holt Shipping Company, prisoner. These men were later lost with the U-boat. Nearly three weeks after the sinking of John Holt, the U-boat came across the 4,257-ton British Matadian, which she torpedoed and sank. After the attack, U-66 was forced <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the mud as British patrol craft engaged her.

40|$|The {{crisis in}} the European {{currency}} area is not yet over. Although {{the situation in the}} financial markets is currently relatively calm, the economic crisis appears <b>to</b> be <b>bottoming</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> most countries. Nevertheless, there are still fundamental design flaws in the Monetary Union. If these are not fully addressed, it will only be {{a matter of time before}} a new crisis hits, and a partial or complete breakup of the Monetary Union cannot be ruled out. The economic consequences would be devastating, not least for Germany. To ensure the survival of the European Monetary Union, fundamental reform is required in three problem areas: the financial markets, public finances, and the real economy. In order to give the Monetary Union a stable foundation, all problem areas must be tackled equally; otherwise, due to interactions between these fields, success in one area might be canceled out by a flare-up of the crisis elsewhere. The present article outlines the elements of such a strategy for the institutional restructuring of the Monetary Union. Other articles in this and the next issue of DIW Economic Bulletin focus on the role of the ECB as the lender of last resort, the banking union and bank regulation, Community bonds, a European investment agenda, migration within the EU, a European unemployment insurance scheme, options for fiscal devaluation, and mechanisms for sovereign bankruptcies...|$|R

[...] "Outside" [...] we could see, ourselves, that there was a {{tremendous}} sea on. We must lie still, in the calm harbor, till the storm should abate. Our passengers hailed from fifteen states; only a few of them had ever been to sea before; manifestly it would not do to pit them against a full-blown tempest until they had got their sea-legs on. Toward evening the two steam tugs that had accompanied us with a rollicking champagne-party of young New Yorkers on board who wished to bid farewell to one of our number in due and ancient form departed, and we were alone on the deep.

40|$|We {{project the}} peak-to-trough decline in home prices {{utilizing}} {{the three most}} popular measures of house prices, which are: (1) the FHFA (formally OFHEO) Index of house values; (2) the FHFA Purchase Only Index; (3) the S&P/Case-Shiller Index of house prices. We utilize six different models to project changes in home prices, including AR, ARIMA, BVAR-level, BVARdifference, BVECM, and Bayesian FA-VAR. The Bayesian FA-VAR outperforms other models in term of simulated out-of-sample {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) criteria. The most important and useful findings of the study, especially for policy makers and investors, are the following; (1) we are projecting for house prices <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> 2010 : 2 Q when using the FHFA Index and forecast a 8. 70 % drop from its 2007 : 2 Q peak to is 2010 : 2 Q trough; (2) the FHFA Purchase Only Index bottoms out in 2010 : 2 Q following a 12. 24 % peak-to-trough decline, with the peak again in 2007 : 2 Q; (3) the S&P/Case-Shiller Index is expected to drop 32. 85 % from its 2006 : 2 Q peak to its 2010 : 1 Q trough. These three indexes measure house prices quite differently. For instance, the S&P/Case-Shiller house price index includes foreclosed houses and shows a much larger decline in national hous...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to test three {{flexible}} polyurethane foams for mattress for comfort and durability. In particular, they were investigated the effects of foam composition and cell architecture on some physical-mechanical properties of interest for bedding applications and related to foam comfort levels (i. e. surface firmness, hysteresis loss and resistance <b>to</b> <b>bottoming</b> <b>out),</b> and their changes after artificial weathering due to moisture and temperature. The results demonstrated that all the three foams have open cell morphology and similar cell structure, with average cell diameters ranging from 430 to 510 micron and wide cell size distribution. As a consequence, they also show comparable water vapor transport behavior. On the contrary, their mechanical response, in terms of hysteresis loss, surface firmness and resistance <b>to</b> <b>bottoming</b> <b>out,</b> was found strongly dependent on their chemical structure and molecular mobility, as inferred from infrared spectroscopy analysis. During accelerated weathering all the foams undergo oxidations that affected their comfort factors in static conditions, giving a progressive lowering of hysteresis loss, surface firmness and resistance <b>to</b> <b>bottoming</b> <b>out,</b> particularly for the two foams having lower crosslinking level and thus slow recovery rate after compression...|$|R
