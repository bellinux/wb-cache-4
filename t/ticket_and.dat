5|$|Dworkin {{later wrote}} that she {{eventually}} {{agreed to help}} smuggle a briefcase of heroin through customs in return for $1,000 and an airplane ticket, thinking that if she was successful she could return home with the <b>ticket</b> <b>and</b> the money, and if caught she would at least escape her ex-husband's abuse by going to prison. The deal for the briefcase fell through, but {{the man who had}} promised Dworkin the money gave her the airline ticket anyway, and she returned to the United States in 1972.|$|E

5|$|Sega later {{produced}} gun games which resemble first-person light gun video games, {{but were}} in fact electro-mechanical games that used rear image projection {{in a manner similar}} to a zoetrope to produce moving animations on a screen. An early example of this was Duck Hunt, which Sega released in 1969; it featured animated moving targets on a screen, printed out the player's score on a <b>ticket,</b> <b>and</b> had sound effects that were volume controllable.|$|E

5|$|After a {{preliminary}} investigation, Geetha calls Georgekutty and family for questioning. Georgekutty, who had predicted {{that this would}} happen, had already taught his family how to change their alibi {{at the time of}} murder. When questioned individually, they give the same replies. Georgekutty also presents the bill of the restaurant, the movie <b>ticket</b> <b>and</b> the bus tickets as proof of their alibi. Geetha questions the owners of the establishments they have been to and their statements prove Georgekutty's alibi. However, Geetha realizes later that Georgekutty had faked the evidence and established his alibi on the owners by going on a trip with his family to the same establishments later.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín {{was elected}} deputy for the {{legislature}} of the Buenos Aires province in 1958, on the UCRP <b>ticket,</b> <b>and</b> was reelected in 1962. He moved to La Plata, {{capital of the}} province, during his tenure. President Frondizi was ousted by a military coup on 29 March 1962, which also closed the provincial legislature.

5|$|As a {{delegate}} to the 1856 Democratic National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, Breckinridge favored Pierce's re-nomination for president. When Pierce's hopes of securing the nomination faltered, Breckinridge joined other erstwhile Pierce backers by throwing his support behind his friend, Stephen Douglas. Even with this additional support, Douglas was still unable to garner {{a majority of the}} delegates' votes, and he withdrew, leaving James Buchanan as the Democratic nominee. William Alexander Richardson, a Kentucky-born Congressman from Illinois, then suggested that nominating Breckinridge for vice-president would balance Buchanan's <b>ticket</b> <b>and</b> placate disgruntled supporters of Douglas or Pierce. A delegate from Louisiana placed his name before the convention, and although Breckinridge desired the nomination, he declined, citing his deference to fellow Kentuckian and former House Speaker Linn Boyd, who was supported by the Kentucky delegation.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the ticket}} {{reselling}} {{that occurred during the}} week after the Super Bowl, and in order to limit that kind of profiteering, Hawaii Senate President Donna Mercado Kim introduced Senate Resolution 12, also known as the Bruno Mars Act. It limits all ticket purchases within 48 hours of the on-sale date to the physical box office. This ensures that anyone who comes to the box office to buy tickets for a show should almost certainly be guaranteed a <b>ticket</b> <b>and</b> discourages ticket scalping. The State Senate in Hawaii passed the law.|$|E

Nevertheless, he continued harassing Wilde, who eventually launched a private prosecution against the peer for criminal libel, triggering a series of trials ending in Wilde's imprisonment for gross indecency.

Menem suggested that he run for governor of the populous Buenos Aires Province, which Duhalde accepted on the condition of a great budget aid to the province. This proposal was supported in Congress by Alfonsín, which led to a steady alliance between both politicians. Duhalde was elected governor, ending the political influence of Cafiero.|$|E
