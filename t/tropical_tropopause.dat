RO profiles feature high vertical resolution and excellent quality in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, which are key factors for tropopause determination, including multiple ones. RO data provide measurements globally and allow examination of both temporal and spatial tropopause characteristics based entirely on observational measurements. To investigate latitudinal and longitudinal tropopause characteristics, the mean annual cycle, and inter-annual variability, we use tropopauses from individual profiles as well as their statistical measures for zonal bands and 5 ° × 10 ° bins. The latitudinal structure of first tropopauses shows the well-known distribution with high (cold) <b>tropical</b> <b>tropopauses</b> and low (warm) extra-tropical tropopauses. In the transition zones (20 to 40 ° N/S), individual profiles reveal varying tropopause altitudes from less than 7 km to more than 17 km due to variability in the subtropical tropopause break. In this region, we also find multiple tropopauses throughout the year. Longitudinal variability is strongest at northern hemispheric mid latitudes and in the Asian monsoon region. The mean annual cycle features changes in amplitude and phase, depending on latitude. This is caused by different underlying physical processes (such as the Brewer–Dobson circulation – BDC) and atmospheric dynamics (such as the strong polar vortex in the southern hemispheric winter). Inter-annual anomalies of tropopause parameters show signatures of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the quasi–biennial oscillation (QBO), and the varying strength of the polar vortex, including sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events. These results are in good agreement with previous studies and underpin the high utility of the entire RO record for investigating latitudinal, longitudinal, and temporal tropopause characteristics globally...|$|R

These correlations quantify the large-scale tropical temperature response to transient convection, showing coherent wave-like variations over ~ 12 - 18 km which span a hemisphere in longitude.

40|$|Remote sensing {{observations}} {{reveal the}} frequent occurrence of tropopause cirrus, thin cirrus layers {{located near the}} <b>tropical</b> cold-point <b>tropopause.</b> Here, we present a theory in which tropical convection plays several important roles in tropopause cirrus formation. First, tropical convection is the primary {{means by which the}} moisture required for tropopause cirrus formation is transported into the upper troposphere. However, previous studies suggest that this convection rarely penetrates to the altitudes at which tropopause cirrus layers are observed, suggesting that additional vertical moisture transport is required to explain tropopause cirrus formation. We propose a mechanism for explaining this transport in which tropical convection plays the key role. According to this hypothesis, the transport is accomplished by meridional circulations that develop within the tropopause transition layer (TTL) in response to momentum transport by Rossby waves generated by tropical convection. Results of a series of global scale model runs designed to test this hypothesis will be presented. In addition, reanalyses vertical velocity data will be examined for evidence of the expected correlation between large-scale rising motion within the TTL and tropical convection. Once moisture is present near the cold-point tropopause, large-scale cooling is required to initiate tropopause cirrus formation. One source of this cooling is stratospheric tropical waves induced by tropical convection, as we will show using a time series of radiosonde temperature data superimposed with data on cloud occurrence from the DOE ARM Nauru 99 field experiment. Observations of the global characteristics of these waves from a longer time series of reanalysis data will also be presented...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis wind {{data shows}} the {{presence}} of a stationary Rossby wave in the lower stratosphere during May. This wave is seen prominently below 70 hPa level, confined between 10 °N and 50 °N latitudes and has a zonal wave number of 6 or 7. It is an extension into the stratosphere of the Asia Pacific Wave (APW) of the troposphere documented by Joseph and Srinivasan (1999). As in the troposphere, in the lower stratosphere this wave shows a phase shift of 20 ° longitude between deficient and excess Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) years. This wave has maximum amplitude at about 200 hPa. The amplitude of the wave decreases both above and below 200 hPa level. The large-amplitude portion of this wave is thus situated in the break region between the <b>tropical</b> and extratropical <b>tropopauses</b> around 30 °N latitude. It is suggested that this large-amplitude APW exchanges the tropical and extratropical airmasses through the tropopause break, making the APW signature seen in the satellite monitored total ozone (TOMS data).

40|$|Anthropogenic {{greenhouse}} gas emissions are warming the global climate at an unprecedented rate. Significant emission reductions will be required soon to avoid a rapid temperature rise. As a potential interim measure to avoid extreme temperature increase, {{it has been suggested}} that Earth's albedo be increased by artificially enhancing stratospheric sulfate aerosols. We use a 3 D chemistry climate model, fed by aerosol size distributions from a zonal mean aerosol model, to simulate continuous injection of 1 - 10 Mt/a into the lower tropical stratosphere. In contrast to the case for all previous work, the particles are predicted to grow to larger sizes than are observed after volcanic eruptions. The reason is the continuous supply of sulfuric acid and hence freshly formed small aerosol particles, which enhance the formation of large aerosol particles by coagulation and, to a lesser extent, by condensation. Owing to their large size, these particles have a reduced albedo. Furthermore, their sedimentation results in a non-linear relationship between stratospheric aerosol burden and annual injection, leading to a reduction of the targeted cooling. More importantly, the sedimenting particles heat the <b>tropical</b> cold point <b>tropopause</b> and, hence, the stratospheric entry mixing ratio of H 2 O increases. Therefore, geoengineering by means of sulfate aerosols is predicted to accelerate the hydroxyl catalyzed ozone destruction cycles and cause a significant depletion of the ozone layer even though future halogen concentrations will be significantly reduced...|$|R

Recent highaltitude, unmanned aircraft measurements provide evidence for two distinct classes of cirrus formed in the <b>tropical</b> <b>tropopause</b> region: (i) vertically extensive cirrus with low ice number concentrations, low extinctions, and large supersaturations (up to approx. 70 %) with respect to ice; and (ii) vertically thin cirrus layers with much higher ice concentrations that effectively deplete the vapor in excess of saturation. The persistent supersaturation in the former class of cirrus is consistent with the long time-scales (several hours or longer) for quenching of vapor in excess of saturation given the low ice concentrations and cold <b>tropical</b> <b>tropopause</b> temperatures. The low-concentration clouds are likely formed on a background population of insoluble particles with concentrations less than 100 L 1 (often less than 20 L 1), whereas the high ice concentration layers (with concentrations up to 10, 000 L 1) can only be produced by homogeneous freezing of an abundant population of aqueous aerosols. These measurements, along with past high-altitude aircraft measurements, indicate that the low-concentration cirrus occur frequently in the <b>tropical</b> <b>tropopause</b> region, whereas the high-concentration cirrus occur infrequently.

We examine {{the influence of}} an additional temperature retrieval and different constraints. The study is performed at the Izaña Observatory ozone super-site (Tenerife Island, Spain). The FTIR system is able to resolve four independent ozone layers with a theoretical precision of better than 7. 5 % in the troposphere, lower, middle and upper stratosphere. This total error includes the smoothing error, which is dominating the random error budget. Furthermore, our theoretical calculations indicate that a very precise knowledge of the instrumental line shape is mandatory for a precise ground-based FTIR remote sensing of stratospheric ozone. Likewise, we show that a simultaneous temperature retrieval is highly recommended. We empirically confirm our precision estimates by daily intercomparisons with Electro Chemical Cell (ECC) sonde profiles.

Good agreement is also observed for the linear trends estimated from the FTIR and the ECC datasets: a negative trend in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere region of about − 0. 3 % yr− 1 and a positive trend in the middle/upper stratosphere of about + 0. 3 % yr− 1 . Admittedly, a 12 -yr time series is too short for reliable trend studies, however, it is worthwhile mentioning that such subtropical ozone profile trends are predicted by climate models due to an increased stratospheric circulation in response to climate change...|$|R

Here, the implementation of the full-Lagrangian transportcore of the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) in theECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry model (EMAC) is presented. A ten-yeartime-slice simulation was performed to evaluate the coupled model systemEMAC/CLaMS. Simulated zonal mean age of air distributions were compared tothe age of air derived from airborne measurements, showing the expected characteristicsof the stratospheric circulation. Climatologies of long-lived tracers (CFC- 11 (CCl 3 F), CFC- 12 (CCl 2 F 2), CH 4, N 2 O) were calculated using the standard ux-formsemi-Lagrangian transport scheme (FFSL) in EMAC, as well as the new CLaMS Lagrangiantransport scheme. The climatologies were compared both to each otherand also to satellite measurements of trace gases. The dierences in the resultingtracer distributions are most pronounced in the regions of strong transport barriers,namely the edge of the <b>tropical</b> pipe, the <b>tropopause,</b> and the edge of the polarvortex.

Composite moisture and meteorological fields based on five ISO events selected in two boreal winters (1991 – 1993) are analyzed using 20 – 80 day band-pass-filtered data. At 215 and 146 hPa, wet anomalies with frequent appearance of cirrus clouds exist over the convective system and move eastward from the Indian Ocean to the central Pacific, suggesting a direct effect of convective activity up to this level. At 100 hPa, however, the moisture field seems to be indirectly affected by convective activity through the dynamical response to the convective heating. Dry anomalies are observed over the Indian Ocean around the developing stage and over the eastern Pacific around the mature-to-decaying stage of the ISO. Cirrus clouds are frequently found over the cold region located to the east of the convective system. These structures around the tropopause level are closely related to the eastward moving Kelvin and Rossby wave responses to the convective heating with the equatorial cold anomaly and with the subtropical anticyclonic gyres. Between the two gyres the easterly wind blowing through the equatorial cold region may cause dehydration through cirrus formation when the convective system develops over the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific. As the northern gyre intensifies, tropical dry air is transported to the subtropical Pacific and eventually to the equatorial eastern Pacific.

The theoretical assessment reveals that the FTIR system is able to resolve four independent ozone layers with a precision of better than 6 % in the troposphere and of better than 3 % in the lower, middle and upper stratosphere. This total error includes the smoothing error, which dominates the random error budget. Furthermore, we estimate that the measurement noise as well as uncertainties in the applied atmospheric temperature profiles and instrumental line shape are leading error sources. We show that a simultaneous temperature retrieval can significantly reduce the total random errors and that a regular determination of the instrumental line shape is important for producing a consistent long-term dataset. These theoretical precision estimates are empirically confirmed by daily intercomparisons with Electro Chemical Cell (ECC) sonde profiles. In order to empirically document the long-term stability of the FTIR ozone profile data we compare the linear trends and seasonal cycles as obtained from the FTIR and ECC time series.

Ozone in the extratropical lowermost stratosphere has significant and hemispheric asymmetric trends. O 3 is projected to increase by nearly 30 % due to ozone recovery in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) and due to enhancements in the stratospheric circulation.

40|$|Ice {{clouds in}} the <b>tropical</b> <b>tropopause</b> layer {{play a key role}} in {{dehydrating}} air as it enters the stratosphere 1, 2. However, in situ measurements show that water vapour within these clouds is unexpectedly supersaturated 3, 4, 5; normally the growth of ice crystals rapidly quenches supersaturation 3. The high in-cloud humidity may be related to the low number of ice crystals found in these clouds 4, 6, but low ice number densities are inconsistent with standard models of cirrus cloud formation involving homogeneous freezing of liquid aerosols 7. Aqueous aerosols rich in organic matter are ubiquitous in the atmosphere 8, 9, and under cirrus conditions they are known to become glassy 10, 11, that is, amorphous, non-crystalline solids. Here we report experiments in a cloud simulation chamber that demonstrate heterogeneous nucleation of ice on glassy solution droplets. Cirrus residues measured in situ showed ice nuclei rich in oxidized organic matter 12, consistent with heterogeneous nucleation on glassy aerosols. In addition, using a one-dimensional cirrus model, we show that nucleation on glassy aerosols may explain low ice crystal numbers and high in-cloud humidity in the <b>tropical</b> <b>tropopause</b> layer. We propose that heterogeneous nucleation on glassy aerosols is an important mechanism for ice nucleation in the <b>tropical</b> <b>tropopause</b> layer. ...|$|E
40|$|The extreme dryness of {{the lower}} {{stratosphere}} {{is believed to be}} caused by freeze-drying of air as it enters the stratosphere through the cold <b>tropical</b> <b>tropopause.</b> Previous investigations have been focused on dehydration occurring at the tops of deep convective cloud systems, However, recent observations of a ubiquitous stratiform cirrus cloud layer near the <b>tropical</b> <b>tropopause</b> suggest the possibility of dehydration as air is slowly lifted by large-scale motions, In this study, we have evaluated this possibility using a detailed ice cloud model. Simulations of ice cloud formation in the temperature minima of gravity waves (wave periods of 1 - 2 hours) indicate that large numbers of ice crystals will likely form due to the low temperatures and rapid cooling. As a result, the crystals do not grow larger than about 10 microns, fallspeeds are no greater than a few cm/s, and little or no precipitation or dehydration occurs. However, ice cloud's formed by large-scale vertical motions (with lifetimes of a day or more) should have,fever crystals and more time for crystal sedimentation to occur, resulting in water vapor depletions as large as 1 ppmv near the tropopause. We suggest that gradual lifting near the <b>tropical</b> <b>tropopause,</b> accompanied by formation of thin cirrus, may account for the dehydration...|$|E
40|$|Exchange {{between the}} upper {{tropical}} troposphere {{and the lower}} stratosphere is considered by examining high altitude aircraft observations of water, ozone, methane, wind and temperature for scale invariance. Such scale invariance is indeed found, on scales from a few hundred metres to the maximum flown, 2800 km (25 great circle degrees). The results apply both to vertical exchange at the <b>tropical</b> <b>tropopause</b> and to isentropic exchange at the subtropical jet stream.
