40|$|Riparian {{ecosystems}} exhibit complex biotic and abiotic dynamics, {{where the}} triad vegetation-sediments-stream determines the ecogeomorphological {{features of the}} river landscape. Random fluctuations of the water stage are a key trait of this triad, {{and a number of}} behaviors of the fluvial environment can be understood only taking into consideration the role of noise. In order to elucidate how randomness shape riparian transects, a stochastic model that takes into account the main links between vegetation, sediments, and the stream is adopted, emphasizing the capability of vegetation to alter the plot topography. A minimalistic approach is pursued, and the probability density function of vegetation biomass is analytically evaluated in any <b>transect</b> <b>plot.</b> This probability density function strongly depends on the vegetation-topography feedback. We demonstrate how the vegetation-induced modifications of the bed topography create more suitable conditions for the survival of vegetation in a stochastically dominated environmen...|$|E

40|$|Mangrove {{structure}} and distribution is conditioned by geomorphic processes. This paper describes {{the response of}} mangroves to sedimentary processes at the Cananéia-Iguape Coastal System on the south coast of São Paulo State (Brazil), between latitudes 24 ° 40 'S and 25 ° 20 'S. Within six study areas 41 plots were established along 14 <b>transects.</b> <b>Plot</b> size varied according to stem density from 2 m× 2 m to 20 m× 20 m. Here mangroves are strongly coupled to sedimentary processes, forming discrete architectural elements within particular depositional environments or topographic settings. These sedimentary structures and progradation environments are colonized by Laguncularia racemosa, associated with the smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora. Rhizophora mangle occurs typically near creeklets where tidal flooding is more frequent. Where tidal influence is restricted Avicennia schaueriana becomes dominant. Erosive margins are dominated by A. schaueriana or R. mangle. Single linkage cluster analysis yields three groups (A, B and C), {{with high levels of}} similarity, providing support to the classification of the data into two broad landform categories: depositional and erosive. Group A includes plots with the least structural development (nominal stem diameter dn between 1. 05 and 4. 61 cm). Group B is composed of stems of intermediate diameter (4. 99 cm ≤ dn ≤ 5. 63 cm). Group C plots have the largest structural development (5. 50 cm ≤ dn ≤ 11. 10 cm). The structure of mangroves (dominance and structural development) reflects responses to geomorphology and habitat change. SCOPUS: cp. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|A {{study on}} {{condition}} and management strategy for sea grass community was undertaken {{on the beach}} area of Denpasar City, Bali Province between March and June, 2010. The study was undertaken on two locations: Sanur and Serangan beaches. Aim {{of the study was}} to find out recent condition, problems related to sea grass and set up its management strategy. The study was utilising <b>Transect</b> <b>Plot</b> methods. Six sampling stations was determined. Identification of condition and degradation of sea grass community was undertaken by retrospective approaches. Data analyses was undertaken by utilising kualitative and kuantitative approaches; refering to determination of â€œKriteria Baku Kerusakan dan Pedoman Penentuan Status Padang Lamunâ€ (the standard criteria for damage and manual for determination of the status of sea grass) refering to Decission of State Minister on Environment Number 200 year 2004 and cualitative ecology index and analogist comparative approach on formulating management strategy. Species richness of sea grass on beaches of Denpasar city was 10 out of 12 of those existed in Indonesia, namely: Zostera sp., Halodule pinifolia, Halodule uninervis, Cymodocea rotundata, Cymodocea serrulata, Syringodium isoetifolium, Thalassodendron ciliatum, Enhalus acoroides, Halophila ovalis and Thalassia hemprichii. Species density of sea grass varied across locations and observation stations, ie. Sanur beach (209 individual/sq. m) and Serangan Island (276 ind/sq. m); with the higest density made by Cymodocea rotundata. Persentage of sea grass cover on the beach of Denpasar was between 28. 79 % â€“ 42. 74 %, with the highest at Serangan-III and the lowest at Sanur-I. Based on the cover, the status of condition of sea grass on the beach area of Denpasar was classified into the category of bad/poor -moderate/less healthy. The average score of level of damage of sea grass on the beach area of Denpasar varied between 8. 89 % â€“ 15. 79 %, which was within the category of low level of damage, where the highest level of damage was at Station I of â€œPerairan Seranganâ€ and the lowest at Serangan II-III, where there were no damage reported to occur.

The {{survey was conducted}} in 2009 – 2012, in the Lublin Province, SE Poland. Data on the bee forage flora were obtained while making floristic charts along 60 <b>transect</b> <b>plots</b> × 300 m, with a total length of 18 [*] 000 m, {{for each type of}} linear structure. Forage bee flora was compared with respect to species richness, diversity, and evenness indices. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to characterize relationship between species composition and environmental variables. The bee forage species richness and abundance were significantly greater on railway embankments than on road verges. The composition of species varied considerably; the number of bee forage species common to both habitats was only approximately 38 % in entire data set. Most good-value bee forage species were recorded along the embankments of railways with an intermediate traffic volume. Bee forage species diversity benefits from the location of habitat elements (forests or meadows), primarily if the distance is < 50 m. The lack of dense patches of valuable bee forage species in the road verges was related to the high density of non-nectariferous graminoids. Our results demonstrate how the value of man-made areas in an agricultural ecosystem can vary with respect to floral resources across the landscape, suggesting that it is inappropriate to generalize about agricultural systems as a whole without first addressing differences among habitats...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the factors}} that {{have an impact on}} the {{diversity}} of forage flora in the agricultural landscape is a key issue in the maintenance and control of food niches for pollinators. Field margins are common linear structures in the agricultural landscape. In the present study, we evaluated {{the factors that}} exert an impact on the forage flora composition and on the diversity in field margins. The study was conducted in the 2010 - 2011 time period across the agricultural landscape on the Lublin Upland of SE Poland. Data on the forage flora were obtained while making floristic charts along 45 <b>transect</b> <b>plots</b> x 300 m; the total length being 13500 m. Multivariate ordination techniques (PCA and RDA) were employed to analyse forage-flora characteristics. Field margins represent valuable refuge areas for forage-species richness, but not for the abundance of forage species. On field margins, forage-species diversity benefits from the location of natural habitats (forests or meadows), primarily if the distance from these habitats is < 1000 m or the field acreage is < 10 ha. The shift from heterogeneous habitats to a more homogeneous landscape causes a reduction of forage floral diversity. Due to lack of dense forage-species patches, the promotion of sowing nectariferous and/or polleniferous species seems to be a reasonable management method to enhance the quantitative food niche on field margins and to support the conservation of pollinators in the areas surrounding farms...|$|R

40|$|Banksia (Proteaceae) {{woodlands}} {{are one of}} {{a number}} of groundwater-dependent ecosystems in southwestern Western Australia that are threatened by groundwater abstraction. In addition to this threat is an ongoing decline in regional water tables due to a drying climate. We used ecological resilience theory to analyse and interpret a long-term vegetation monitoring dataset from a site that has experienced an abstraction-induced acute groundwater drawdown in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. Despite reduced plant abundance, all dominant over- and understorey species were still found on all <b>transect</b> <b>plots</b> in which they were recorded pre-drawdown. This suggests a notional resilience and a strong likelihood of recovery, in the event that pre-drawdown ecohydrological habitat conditions were to return. However, since the drawdown event, the regional water table continued to decline, with the vegetation responding through progressive and uni-directional change in abundance and composition. The change in composition was primarily manifested as a shift towards non-woody, shallow-rooted species not dependent on specific hydrological conditions. This slow, progressive change in hydrology associated with reduced rainfall and land use changes has continued to force a transition in the floristics towards an alternative ecohydrological state. Despite the absence of an acute drawdown event, the same progressive floristic response was also observed at two reference sites that were not under the immediate influence of production bores. The challenge for adaptive water resource management will be to enhance the capacity for resilience in these groundwater-dependent ecosystems in a drying environment through appropriate regulation of groundwater abstraction...|$|R

Vegetation surveys of 1 m x 1 m plots were conducted along previously-established transects of salt marshes for four different sites; three restored salt marshes (Y-Marsh, Mitchell Marsh, Salmon Creek Marsh) and one reference site (Reference Marsh). Additionally, vegetation data were collected from three 20 m x 50 m modified Whittaker plots at each of the four sites. Soil samples were collected at <b>transect</b> <b>plots,</b> processed according to National Soil Survey Center protocol, and analyzed for pH, bulk density, salinity, conductivity, and carbon/nitrogen content. Vegetation and soil characteristics (bulk density, salinity, conductivity) were used to compare spatial patterns in vegetation diversity for restored and reference salt marshes. Results indicate significant differences between the vegetation of reference and restored tidal marshes surveyed; differences in vegetation were associated with differences in elevation, soil salinity, and disturbance history. Outcomes indicate that restored marshes are more heterogeneous in species composition. Marsh surface elevation does not differ significantly among sites that were restored at different times in this estuary. The highest soil salinity and lowest elevation occurs in Y-Marsh, the marsh closest geographically to the mouth of the estuary. Vegetation of restored salt marshes is significantly less diverse and more spatially homogeneous than that of reference sites, even four decades post-restoration.

We installed permanent belt <b>transects</b> (<b>plots)</b> for long-term monitoring of aspen stands {{both within and outside}} of established wolf pack terri-tories on YNP’s northern range to determine if reintroduced wolves are influencing elk browsing patterns and aspen regeneration through a trophic cascades interaction. Wolves may have an indirect effect on aspen regeneration by altering elk movements, browsing patterns, and foraging behavior (predation risk effects). Elk pellet groups, aspen sucker heights, and the percentage of browsed suckers were the variables used to measure differences in aspen stands in high and low wolf-use areas of the northern range. The aspen stands in the high wolf-use areas had significantly lower counts of elk pellet groups in the mesic upland steppe and the combined mesic upland steppe and riparian/wet meadow habitat types. Based on our pellet group results, it appears that elk foraging behaviors may have been altered by the increased risk of predation due to the reintroduction of the wolf. In the riparian/ wet meadow habitat type, mean aspen sucker heights were significantly higher in the high wolf-use areas than in the low wolf-use areas. The percentage of browsed suckers in high and low wolf-use areas showed no significant differences in any of the habitat types. Considering the high browsing pressure in YNP aspen stands, it is uncertain whether the taller aspen suckers measured in the high wolf-use areas will eventually join the aspen overstory. These permanent plots represent a valuable baseline data set to assess any current and future aspen regeneration responses to the reintroduction of wolves in YNP. # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We describe the Sabah Biodiversity Experiment: a large-scale, long-term field study on the island of Borneo. The project aims at understanding the relationship between tree species diversity and the functioning of lowland dipterocarp rainforest during restoration following selective logging. The experiment is planned to run for several decades (from seed to adult tree), so here we focus on introducing the project and its experimental design and on assessing initial conditions and the potential for restoration of the structure and functioning of the study system, the Malua Forest Reserve. We estimate residual impacts 22 years after selective logging by comparison with an appropriate neighbouring area of primary forest in Danum Valley of similar conditions. There was no difference in the alpha or beta species diversity of <b>transect</b> <b>plots</b> in the two forest types, probably owing to the selective nature of the logging and potential effects of competitive release. However, despite equal total stem density, forest structure differed as expected with a deficit of large trees and a surfeit of saplings in selectively logged areas. These impacts on structure have the potential to influence ecosystem functioning. In particular, above-ground biomass and carbon pools in selectively logged areas were only 60 per cent of those in the primary forest even after 22 years of recovery. Our results establish the initial conditions for the Sabah Biodiversity Experiment and confirm the potential to accelerate restoration by using enrichment planting of dipterocarps to overcome recruitment limitation.

Ischnocnema parva (Girard, 1853) is endemic to the Atlantic Rainforest biome and is restricted to the forests of southeastern Brazil. Currently, the available information about the ecology of I. parva is scarce. We studied the diet, the habitat use, reproduction and density of I. parva {{in an area of}} Atlantic Rainforest at the Concórdia mountain range, Rio de Janeiro. Individuals of I. parva were captured in April 2005 using different sampling methods: time constrained search (<b>transects),</b> <b>plots</b> of 5 x 5 m (25 m²) on the litter, and pitfall traps with drift fences. We found 240 frogs; 35 females and 205 males. Females (mean SVL = 19. 1 mm) were significantly larger (F 1, 238 = 143. 016, R² = 0. 375, p < 0. 001) than males (13. 2 mm). The species preyed mainly on arthropods, with ants and isopods being the most important items, both showing high values of importance index (Ix = 50. 0 and 26. 7, respectively). Ischnocnema parva is a terrestrial species whose preferential microhabitat at the Serra da Concórdia was the litter of the forest floor (78. 7 %). The activity was predominantly crepuscular-nocturnal and the estimated density of I. parva was 24. 9 ind/ 100 m². For the eight ovigerous females captured, the mean number of mature oocytes per female was 25 (range: 22 - 30) and the oocyte mean diameter was 1. 11 mm (N = 40 oocytes). Oocyte number increased with female body size (R² = 0. 504, F 1, 6 = 6. 107, p < 0. 05, N = 8), indicating that as females increase in size they produce larger clutches.

From 2008 to 2012, the Malheur National Forest was subject to an outbreak of pine butterfly in ponderosa pine, peaking at ~ 100, 000 ha of forest visibly defoliated in 2011. Silvicultural-based management guidelines {{have been used to}} manage stand resilience to other insect defoliators, but guidelines specific to the pine butterfly are currently lacking. The goal {{of this study is to}} examine pine butterfly defoliation patterns to relate stand and tree structure characteristics to inform management guidelines. I randomly sampled 25 stands within ponderosa pine forests delineated as heavily defoliated in 2011 by annual forest health aerial surveys. Within each stand I randomly located three <b>transect</b> <b>plots,</b> 10 x 40 m, and measured diameter at breast height (DBH), height, and estimated defoliation for the entirety of all trees > 5 cm DBH. Data was analyzed using linear mixed effects models to account for all other determinants of defoliation before measuring variables under study. Defoliation averaged 67 % for all trees. Stand density index, stand structure, tree crown class, and level within a tree canopy demonstrated no meaningful effects on mean defoliation. I infer from these results that defoliation levels during pine butterfly outbreaks are not influenced by structural or crown characteristics; virtually all available foliage is consumed in these single host-species stands (though note that ~ 10 % of trees studied showed < 50 % defoliation levels). This suggests that the most relevant factor to managers interested in reducing tree mortality and growth loss may prove to be individual tree health prior to an outbreak. Therefore, standard silvicultural recommendations of thinning ponderosa pine to reduce competition and increase tree vigor and resilience is likely to be a good course in areas that are prone to pine butterfly outbreaks, although the best available information suggests that thinning should not be conducted during an outbreak...|$|R

40|$|Global {{climate change}} has multidimensional impacts with several {{biological}} fingerprints, and treeline shifting {{in tandem with}} climate change is a widely observed phenomenon {{in various parts of}} the world. In Nepal several impacts of climate change on physical environments have been observed. However, studies on the biological impacts are lacking. This dendrochronological study was carried out at the treeline ecotone (3750 – 4003 m a. s. l.) in the Kalchuman Lake (Kal Tal) area of the Manaslu Conservation Area in central Nepal Himalaya with the aim to study the dynamic impact of climate change at the treeline. The study provides an insight into regeneration and treeline dynamics over the past 200 yr. Two belt <b>transect</b> <b>plots</b> (size: 20 m wide, > 250 m long) were laid covering forest line, treeline as well as tree species Abies spectabilis and Betula utilis was done and their tree-cores were collected. Stand character and age distribution revealed an occurrence of more matured B. utilis (max. age 198 yr old) compared to A. spectabilis (max. age 160 yr). A. spectabilis contained an overwhelmingly high population (89 %) of younger plants (A. spectabilis at the rate of 2. 61 m yr − 1 since 1850 AD. The upper distribution limit of B. utilis was found stagnant in the past few decades. An increment in plant density as well as upward shifting in the studied treeline ecotones was observed. Thus, two species presented species-specific responses to climate change and much wider differences anticipated in their population status as climate continues to cha spectabilis correlated negatively with the mean monthly temperature of May–August of the current year and with September of the previous year. The regeneration of A. spectabilis, on the other hand, was positively related with May–August precipitation and January–April temperature of the current year. The reconstructed average summer temperature (May–August) using tree ring data revealed alternate period of cool and warm period with warming in the 2 nd half of the 20 th century. Further palynological and geochronological studies of sediments of the Kalchuman Lake would advance our understanding of past climatic trends and dynamics of the associated treeline and vegetation in the area...|$|R
40|$|Treeline {{shifting}} {{in tandem}} with climate change has widely been reported from {{various parts of the}} world. In Nepal, several impacts of climate change on the physical environment have been observed, but study on the biological impacts is lacking. This dendrochronological study was carried out at the treeline in the high mountain slope of Kalchuman Lake (3750 – 4003 m a. s. l.) area of Manaslu Conservation Area in the central Nepal Himalaya to explore the impact of climate change on the treeline dynamic. Two belt <b>transect</b> <b>plots</b> (size: 20 m wide, > 250 m long) were laid which included treeline as well as tree species limit. Ecological mapping of all individuals of dominant trees Abies spectabilis and Betula utilis was done and their tree cores were collected. Stand character and age distribution revealed an occurrence of more matured B. utilis (max. age 198 years) compared to A. spectabilis (max. age 160 years). A. spectabilis contained an overwhelmingly high population (89 %) of younger plants (< 50 years) indicating its high recruitment rate. Population age structure along the elevation gradient revealed an upward shifting of A. spectabilis at the rate of 2. 61 m year - 1 since AD 1850. The upper distribution limit of B. utilis was found to be stagnant in the past few decades. An increment in plant density as well as upward shifting in the studied treeline ecotones was observed. The temporal growth of A. spectabilis was correlated negatively with the monthly mean and minimum temperature of June to September of the current and previous year. The regeneration of A. spectabilis, on the other hand, was positively correlated with August precipitation and monthly maximum temperature of the month of the current year. The growth and regeneration of A. spectabilis was more sensitive to maximum and minimum temperature rather than average temperature. The growth of the B. utilis was mainly limited by moisture stress during the pre-monsoon season. As these two species presented species-specific responses to climate change with differential pattern in regeneration condition, much wider differences are anticipated in their population status as climate continues to change throughout the century...|$|R
30|$|Because {{the young}} juniper {{woodlands}} {{did not have}} an abundance of 1000 -h DWD and exhibited high variability, the observations of these fuel categories were not normally distributed and were therefore excluded from statistical analysis. These fuels were estimated along five 30  m transects, (i.e., 150  m total <b>transect</b> length per <b>plot)</b> since larger fuels have been shown to vary at broader scales than the fine fuels (Keane et al. 2012).

40|$|Information on snag {{locations}} and densities {{is useful for}} managing many species of wildlife. Using a combination of belt <b>transects,</b> fixed <b>plots,</b> and aerial photographs, we recorded snag species, locations, and causal agents of tree mortality in subalpine forests in the Entiat watershed in Washington state. The overall snag density (all standing dead trees) was 51 per hectare. Subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) were the most common species of snags. Weather-related effects created more snags than any other disturbance in the period between stand-replacing fires. The density of dominant and codominant snags did not differ by aspect or slope categories, but the density of intermediate and suppressed snags was highest on steep south-facing slopes. Snag densities were lowest in stand initiation and open stem exclusion structural stages.

40|$|Phenological studies help {{to analyze}} {{resource}} abundance and feeding ecology of some herbivorous primate species. The rainforest between the rivers Aghnashini and Sharavathy in Karnataka, India, {{is one of}} the richest primate habitats in the country. Plant resource availability was studied in this forest using belt <b>transect</b> and <b>plot</b> methods. More than 800 trees of 71 species were considered for phenology sampling, and the tree species used by primates for consumption of leaves, flowers and fruits were selected for availability monitoring. Flush leaves were available throughout the year. The availability of mature leaves and flowers was highest in pre-summer (December–February). Unripe and ripe fruits were mostly available in summer (March–May). The availability of these resources showed significant seasonal variation. The availability and abundance of plant food resources throughout the year, presence of keystone species and broad food niches probably account for the presence of a high density of primates including 32, 47 and 151 groups of lion-tailed macaques, bonnet macaques and Hanuman langurs respectively in about 200  km 2 of this forest making this region a model for primate conservation...|$|R

40|$|One deep (13 – 15 m depth) and two {{shallow water}} (1. 5 and 7 m) coral {{communities}} in the Galápagos Islands, Ecuador were monitored for tissue response (bleaching, paling, morbidity) and secondary responses during and after elevated temperature stress associated with the 1997 – 98 El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. Between March and May 1998, the fungiid coral Diaseris distorta paled and bleached (up to 88. 0 % of all individuals bleached) at 13 – 15 m depth. The small branching colonial coral, Psammocora stellata, paled (79. 2 % of all colonies) with very little bleaching (11. 1 %), also at 13 – 15 m depth. However, by May 1998 colonies of this species in shallower water (7 m depth) suffered high mean mortality (72. 4 % of colony area, 85. 1 % decrease in numbers of live colonies). In March 1998, colonies of Pavona clavus, a massive coral species, were 100 % bleached at 1. 5 m depth and experienced subsequent partial mortality averaging 34. 0 % per colony. Both Diaseris and Psammocorain deeper water (13 – 15 m depth) recovered pigment by June 1999. Numbers of Diaseris individuals within permanent <b>transect</b> <b>plots</b> decreased 56. 1 % from March 1998 through August 2000, but this loss was most likely due to coral displacement by currents and surge rather than temperature-induced mortality. Numbers of Psammocora colonies in deep water did not change appreciably during the survey period (− 16. 1 %). In contrast, surviving shallower water (7 m depth) Psammocora recovered pigment by June 1999, but numbers of live colonies remained low through August 2000 (− 83. 3 % compared to March 1998). Initial recovery of pigmented tissue was evident in Pavona by June 1999, but a decline in live tissue again occurred by August 2000. Sea water temperature at the deeper site reached 28 – 30 °C, but periods of semi-diurnal cooling may have mitigated the bleaching response. Highest temperatures occurred in shallower water (7 m), where Psammocora experienced high mortality and periodic subsurface cooling was suppressed. These data cannot be compared with those from the 1982 – 83 ENSO {{because of the lack}} of quantitative data from the earlier event. However, these observations provide a framework of comparison with other ENSO-affected eastern Pacific coral communities and reefs during the 1997 – 98 event...|$|R
