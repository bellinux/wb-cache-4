25|$|<b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>says</b> {{that the}} Russian Federation – the state which has carried out {{military}} occupation – is fully {{responsible for the}} violation {{of human rights in}} Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The Russian Federation, according to the document, is also responsible for compensation of material and moral damage inflicted on Georgian citizens, stateless persons and foreign citizens, who are in Georgia and enter the occupied territories with appropriate permits.|$|E
25|$|Although {{natural law}} is often {{confused}} with common law, {{the two are}} distinct. Even though natural law theories have exercised a profound influence {{on the development of}} English common law, the latter is not based on inherent rights, but is the legal tradition whereby certain rights or values are legally recognized by virtue of already having judicial recognition or articulation. Natural law is often contrasted with the human-made laws (positive law) of a given state, political entity or society. In legal theory, the interpretation of a human-made law requires some reference to natural law. On this understanding of natural law, natural law can be invoked to criticize judicial decisions about what <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>says,</b> but not to criticize the best interpretation of the law itself.|$|E
25|$|Scalia also {{attacked}} {{the majority opinion}} as being fundamentally antidemocratic. His dissent cited a passage from The Federalist Papers in arguing {{that the role of}} the judiciary in the constitutional scheme is to interpret the law as formulated in democratically selected legislatures. He argued that the Court exists to rule on what <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>says,</b> not what it should say, and that it is for the legislature, acting in the manner prescribed in Article V of the Constitution to offer amendments to the Constitution in light of the evolving standard of decency, not for the Court to arbitrarily make de facto amendments. He challenged the right of unelected lawyers to discern moral values and to impose them on the people in the name of flexible readings of the constitutional text.|$|E

5000|$|This {{does not}} answer whether it is just or unjust for Socrates {{to escape from the}} prison, so Socrates asks what <b>the</b> <b>Laws</b> would <b>say</b> about his leaving. Socrates claims that <b>the</b> <b>Laws</b> would <b>say</b> that he destroys the city in leaving, and that this would be unjust. <b>The</b> <b>Laws</b> <b>say</b> that a citizen stands in {{relation}} to the city as the child does to the parent, as the slave does to his master.|$|R
500|$|Scholar Claudia Mills {{wrote that}} Marty's parents {{subscribe}} {{to the belief that}} because Shiloh is Judd's property, they should not be concerned with how Judd treats Shiloh. They tell Marty: [...] "You've got to go by the law. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>says</b> that a man that pays money for a dog owns that dog." [...] At odds with this philosophy, Marty strongly believes that love—not money—should determine ownership.|$|E
500|$|Another way to {{interpret}} the clause is {{through the lens of}} textualism, that is, giving primary consideration to what <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>says</b> rather than to its purpose. Most legal scholars who take this view argue that the Saxbe fix does not address the constitutional problem. Because to textualism believers the language of the rule is an absolute prohibition, law professor and textualist Michael Paulsen has said, a [...] "'fix' can rescind the salary, ... but it cannot repeal historical events. The emoluments of the office had been increased. The rule specified in the text still controls." [...] Most textualists agree that the spirit of the Ineligibility Clause would be addressed by a Saxbe fix, but they dispute that a clause's [...] "spirit" [...] overrides its text.|$|E
2500|$|However, as Bertrand Russell {{stated in}} a letter to Beatrice Webb in 1923, this {{formulation}} has problems: 'I don't know whether [...] was ever made to realise the implications of the second law of thermodynamics; if so, he may well be upset. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>says</b> that everything tends to uniformity and a dead level, diminishing (not increasing) heterogeneity'.|$|E

2500|$|... “As in all {{the churches}} of the saints, the women should keep silence in the churches. For they are not {{permitted}} to speak but should be subordinate, as even <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>says.</b> If there is anything they desire to know, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.” ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{position}} on implementing the Tenth Amendment, Paul explained, [...] "Certain medical procedures and medical choices, I would allow the states to determine that. The state law should prevail not the Federal Government." [...] Speaking specifically about Drug Enforcement Administration raids on medical marijuana clinics Paul said, [...] "They're unconstitutional", {{and went on to}} advocate states' rights and personal choice: [...] "You're not being compassionate by taking medical marijuana from someone who's suffering from cancer or AIDS ... People should have freedom of choice. We certainly should respect the law and <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>says</b> that states should be able to determine this." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>says</b> {{that the}} Russian Federation – the state which has carried out {{military}} occupation – is fully {{responsible for the}} violation {{of human rights in}} Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The Russian Federation, according to the document, is also responsible for compensation of material and moral damage inflicted on Georgian citizens, stateless persons and foreign citizens, who are in Georgia and enter the occupied territories with appropriate permits. The law also says that de facto state agencies and officials operating in the occupied territories are regarded by Georgia as illegal. The law will remain in force until [...] "the full restoration of Georgian jurisdiction" [...] over the breakaway regions is realised.|$|E
50|$|Opponents of <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>say</b> {{that it will}} {{ultimately}} cost the state “$26.4 billion in economic activity, $11.7 billion in gross state product and approximately 140,024 jobs” if all illegal immigrants are removed from the state.|$|R
50|$|The ACLU filed {{a lawsuit}} in federal court to {{invalidate}} <b>the</b> <b>law</b> on December 13, 2011, claiming <b>the</b> <b>law</b> violates <b>the</b> constitutional guarantee of equal protection under <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> On April 29, 2014, U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman struck down <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> <b>saying</b> it violated <b>the</b> Voting Rights Act and U.S. Constitution.|$|R

2500|$|There {{are cases}} where, {{if the child}} is returned, the {{abductor}} will not or cannot return with the child out of safety concerns. One of the crucial problems is that, upon return to the foreign country, abducting parents lack resources to hire a lawyer to obtain protective measures against domestic violence. Another concern regarding signing the treaty is the possibility that implementing it would, in practice, [...] "tear the child away from a parent", as a primary caregiver would be unable to accompany the children to countries which have criminalized parental abduction. Colin Jones, a law professor of Doshisha University, commented that [...] "hatever <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>says,</b> {{it is very hard to}} imagine it being in the interests of the police and prosecutors to be seen taking crying half-Japanese children away from distraught Japanese mothers." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept in}} {{cardinal}} utility theory that marginal utilities diminish across the ranges relevant to decision-making {{is called the}} [...] "law of diminishing marginal utility" [...] (and {{is also known as}} Gossen's First Law). This refers to the increase in utility an individual gains from increasing their consumption of a particular good. [...] "The law of diminishing marginal utility {{is at the heart of}} the explanation of numerous economic phenomena, including time preference and the value of goods (...) <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>says,</b> first, that the marginal utility of each homogenous unit decreases as the supply of units increases (and vice versa); second, that the marginal utility of a larger-sized unit is greater than the marginal utility of a smaller-sized unit (and vice versa). The first law denotes the law of diminishing marginal utility, the second law denotes the law of increasing total utility." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, the Israeli Supreme Court upheld major {{provisions}} {{of a law}} imposing consequences on those who call for boycotting Israel and occupied territories. The ruling sparked debate, with some protesting it ends freedom of speech while others say it affirms Israel's stand on [...] "the destructive nature of the BDS" [...] (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement). Israeli human rights groups had petitioned against <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> <b>saying</b> it infringes on freedom of speech. Supporters of <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>say</b> it prohibits [...] "discrimination based on geography." [...] "To exclude calls for a boycott from the category of free speech is incorrect," [...] said Rabbi David Rosenn, New Israel Fund's (NIF) executive vice president. [...] "There is not a separate category for speech that is political.

6000|$|... "Well, it's this way.

Well, when there's a fuss, all the man has to do is to clear out all the families but two. Then, when the inspector fellow comes along, and says, let's say, 'Where's your running water on each floor? That's what <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>says</b> you've got to have, and here are these people having to go downstairs and out of doors to fetch their water supplies,' the landlord simply replies, 'Nothing doing. This isn't a tenement house at all. There are only two families here.' And when the fuss has blown over, back come the rest of the crowd, and things go on the same as before." ...|$|E
