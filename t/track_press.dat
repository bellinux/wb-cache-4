50|$|The album {{consists}} of four continuous tracks on the compact disc release split into two CDs. The double LP release has each <b>track</b> <b>pressed</b> onto their own side. Time lengths of individual movements are taken from the official discography. Times for each movement appear in the album's cover art, but those times are very inaccurate. While {{the movements of the}} tracks are listed, the names of the four tracks that make up the album are unlisted on the CD.|$|R
5000|$|The {{claims of}} {{scientists}} also get {{distorted by the}} media by a tendency to seek out extreme views, which can result in portrayal of risks well beyond the claims actually being made by scientists. Journalists tend to overemphasize the most extreme outcomes {{from a range of}} possibilities reported in scientific articles. A study that <b>tracked</b> <b>press</b> reports about a climate change article in the journal Nature found that [...] "results and conclusions of the study were widely misrepresented, especially in the news media, to make the consequences seem more catastrophic and the timescale shorter." ...|$|R

CPJ shares information on breaking cases with other press freedom organizations worldwide through the International Freedom of Expression Exchange, a global e-mail network. CPJ also tracks journalist deaths and detentions. CPJ staff applies strict criteria for each case; researchers independently investigate and verify the circumstances behind each death or imprisonment.|$|R

40|$|The Altogether is a {{photographic}} book {{by the artist}} Chris Coekin, who over six years has been visiting and producing artwork in a factory based in Sandbach, Cheshire. The factory began manufacturing copper wire in 1834, {{making it one of}} the oldest industrial environments in the UK. Unfortunately, due to the economic downturn, the factory closed and the entire workforce was made redundant. The Altogether is an ambitious multi-layered project that investigates the notions of art, work and struggle. Conceptually, it continues and expands upon ideas seen elsewhere in Coekin's photographic practice and in his collaborative working methodology. Along with a series of staged portraits, ambiguous industrial-scapes and still lifes, Coekin has produced music sourced from the factory floor. The Altogether comprises three series of photographic images â€“ The Altogether, Manufactory Pt I and Manufactory Pt II (aka Made In England), and two audio <b>tracks</b> <b>pressed</b> on to a seven-inch vinyl record: Days at the Factories and CuSO 4 Shuffle...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a personalized event scheduling recom-mender system, PRESS, {{for a large}} conference setting with multiple parallel <b>tracks.</b> <b>PRESS</b> is a mobile application that gathers personalized information from a user and recommends talks/demos to be attend. The input from a user include a list of keyword preferences and (optionally) preferred talks. We use the MALLET topic model package to analyze the set of conference papers and classify them based on automatically identified topics. We propose an algorithm to generate a list of recommended papers based on the user keywords and the MALLET topics. An optimization model is then applied to obtain a feasible schedule. The recommended set is matched against the selected papers by the user which we obtained from a survey conducted at AAMAS- 15 in Istanbul, Turkey. We show that PRESS is able to provide reasonable accuracy, precision and recall rates. PRESS will be deployed live during AAMAS- 16 in Singapore...|$|R

40|$|News agencies, or wire services, {{are playing}} a growing role in the {{contemporary}} news environment, primarily due to the prevalence of the 24 / 7 online newsroom and its associated need for speed and volumes of copy. At the same time press releases and other public relations generated material daily flood the news environment. This paper builds on research into these two fields, trialling a new methodology*one which follows press releases and other public relations material through the uptake by news agencies, in particular the Australian Associated Press, and finally, as published stories in metropolitan online newspapers. While previous research has <b>tracked</b> <b>press</b> releases and news agency copy individually, this study is significant because it follows the three distinct phases in the news cycle and determines how the news agency*the most pervasive and trusted news source*can become the de facto distributor of public relations material. It grounds the study {{in the work of}} political economists, who have endeavoured since the 1970 s to explain the dwindling quality and quantity of good journalism in leading democracies. This work sets the foundations for a larger study into the production of news in contemporary media environments.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{findings}} of two studies that <b>tracked</b> <b>press</b> coverage of HIV/AIDS in several southern African countries and Papua New Guinea (PNG) from the mid- 1980 s. The main reason for their selection {{is that they are}} the most extensive studies to date on the topic in Southern Africa and the Pacific region and the countries share distinct cultural similarities. The findings, while wide-ranging, do present new challenges for Pacific journalists who report on HIV- a disease that has seen massive increases {{in some parts of the}} region since the mid- 1980 s. Common trends in the countries surveyed revealed that a disproportionate emphasis was placed upon reporting infection rates, international funding and regional workshops, with little in-depth analysis of the disease or educational content. On the positive side, the language and tone of HIV stories showed more sensitivity to people living with the disease. It was no surprise that there was little agreement on the precise role of the press in reporting HIV. This is a key issue that remains unsolved. There was, however, broad agreement that journalists should widen their coverage and report HIV as a story with medical, political, social, economic, cultural, religious and relationship aspects.

Despite these improvements, Cardiff's position in the Welsh urban hierarchy had declined over the 18th century. Iolo Morganwg called it [...] "an obscure and inconsiderable place", and the 1801 census found the population to be only 1,870, making Cardiff only the twenty-fifth largest town in Wales, well behind Merthyr Tydfil and Swansea.|$|R
