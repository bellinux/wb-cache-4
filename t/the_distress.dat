5|$|Scientists {{debate whether}} Smilodon was social. One study of African predators found that social predators like lions and spotted hyenas respond more to <b>the</b> <b>distress</b> calls of prey than solitary species. Since S.fatalis fossils are common at the La Brea Tar Pits, and were likely {{attracted}} by <b>the</b> <b>distress</b> calls of stuck prey, this {{could mean that}} this species was social as well. One critical study claims that the study neglects other factors, such as body mass (heavier animals {{are more likely to}} get stuck than lighter ones), intelligence (some social animals, like the American lion, may have avoided the tar because they were better able to recognize the hazard), lack of visual and olfactory lures, the type of audio lure, and the length of <b>the</b> <b>distress</b> calls (the actual distress calls of the trapped prey animals would have lasted longer than the calls used in the study). The author of that study ponders what predators would have responded if the recordings were played in India, where the otherwise solitary tigers are known to aggregate around a single carcass. The authors of the original study responded that though effects of the calls in the tar pits and the playback experiments would not be identical, this would not be enough to overturn their conclusions. In addition, they stated that weight and intelligence would not likely affect the results as lighter carnivores are far more numerous than heavy herbivores and the social (and seemingly intelligent) dire wolf is also found in the pits.|$|E

5|$|After a stay of six weeks, Hogg had {{to return}} to the conveyancer's office in York, and the Shelleys decided to {{accompany}} him back to his home in that city. In October 1811 Percy left for London to mediate in a dispute between his father and his uncle. Harriet remained with Hogg, who soon made further unsuccessful romantic advances towards her. Harriet's mother soon learned that Hogg and her daughter were living together, and sent Harriet's sister to stay with them. Harriet complained to Percy Shelley on his return about the way Hogg had treated her; Percy was offended, but nevertheless remained on friendly terms with Hogg. Troubled by <b>the</b> <b>distress</b> felt by his housemates, Percy Shelley suddenly decided to leave York with Harriet and her sister. Hogg subsequently sent him a series of angry letters in which he complained about how he had been treated. In his replies Shelley maintained that he still valued free love, but had left to calm Harriet. Hogg and Shelley subsequently exchanged many emotional letters {{over the course of the}} following two months, but then ceased communicating for a year.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{enters the}} neutral zone, to {{investigate}} <b>the</b> <b>distress</b> call of a Talarian freighter. The freighter is badly damaged, and three life forms are detected aboard. An away team beams over and finds three Klingons: Korris (Vaughn Armstrong); Konmel (Charles Hyman); and Kunivas (Robert Bauer), who is wounded. The away team returns {{with them to}} the Enterprise before the freighter explodes. Kunivas is taken to sickbay and Korris meets with Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). The Klingon explains that they were passengers when the freighter was attacked by a Ferengi ship; the Klingons took over the freighter to fend off and destroy the Ferengi ship, but the damage sustained left the freighter adrift and faltering. As Korris and Konmel are shown to quarters, they are surprised to hear about a fellow Klingon, Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn), who is serving within Starfleet.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{is called}} to Deep Space Station K7 by a {{distress}} call. It is near Sherman's Planet, a world whose ownership is under dispute between the Federation and the Klingon Empire. On arrival, Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) becomes furious when he finds out the reason for <b>the</b> <b>distress</b> call, which was made by station manager Lurry (Whit Bissell) by the orders of Nilz Baris (William Schallert), the Undersecretary of Agriculture for the sector: Baris wants someone to guard the shipments of quadrotriticale (related to triticale) grain bound for Sherman's Planet, since quadrotriticale is the only Earth grain that would grow on Sherman's Planet and thus is required to resolve the ownership issue. Kirk assigns two crewmen to guard the grain, but afterwards learns that Starfleet Command share Baris' concerns. In addition, a Klingon ship commanded by Captain Koloth (William Campbell) arrives, who requests permission for his crew to board K7 for shore leave. Kirk agrees, but limits the number of Klingons {{at any one time}} and they must travel under Starfleet guard while on the station.|$|E

5|$|To achieve full {{political}} control despite not having an absolute majority in parliament, Hitler's government brought the Ermächtigungsgesetz (Enabling Act) {{to a vote}} in the newly elected Reichstag. The Act—officially titled the Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich ("Law to Remedy <b>the</b> <b>Distress</b> of People and Reich")—gave Hitler's cabinet the power to enact laws without the consent of the Reichstag for four years. These laws could (with certain exceptions) deviate from the constitution. Since it would affect the constitution, the Enabling Act required a two-thirds majority to pass. Leaving nothing to chance, the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to arrest all 81 Communist deputies (in spite of their virulent campaign against the party, the Nazis had allowed the KPD to contest the election) and prevent several Social Democrats from attending.|$|E
5|$|Close to the Peary, the Aurora {{receives}} an indistinct distress call from another ship and alters its course to help, but inquiries by Tintin expose that <b>the</b> <b>distress</b> signal is a decoy to delay them. Resuming the journey, they intercept a cable announcing that the Peary expedition {{has reached the}} meteorite but not yet claimed it. While the Peary crew rows to the meteorite, Tintin uses the Auroras seaplane to parachute onto the meteorite and plant the expedition's flag. Tintin makes camp while the Auroras engines are repaired after developing trouble. The next day he discovers that Phostlite accelerates growth, and makes things much larger: his apple core grows into a large tree while a maggot grows into a huge butterfly, and Tintin is menaced by a giant spider that escaped from his lunch box, and immense, explosive mushrooms before rescue arrives. A sudden seaquake shakes the meteorite to its core and it sinks into the sea, just as Tintin and Snowy escape to the Aurora {{with a piece of}} Phostlite. Thereafter Bohlwinkel learns that he is expected to be tried for his crimes. As the Aurora returns home, Captain Haddock steers the ship toward land to refuel not with oil, but with whiskey.|$|E
5|$|On {{the way to}} the Delta Labs, {{the marine}} is {{contacted}} by Betruger, who is now clearly shown to be working in cooperation with Hell in order to invade Earth. If the marine did not send <b>the</b> <b>distress</b> call to Earth, Betruger does so himself, hoping to use the ships bringing reinforcements to transport the demons to Earth. Betruger then unsuccessfully attempts to kill the marine using the toxic gases in the base's recycling facilities. Upon arriving at the Delta Labs, the marine learns of the details behind the teleportation experiments, expeditions into Hell to retrieve specimens and Betruger's increasing obsession with the tests, as well as of an archaeological dig under the surface of Mars. The dig is excavating the ruins of an ancient civilization discovered on Mars, and has produced a relic known as the Soul Cube. According to a scientist the marine finds alive in the labs, the Soul Cube is a weapon created by the ancient civilization to defend against the forces of Hell. The scientist also reveals that the invasion began when Betruger took the Soul Cube into the portal {{at the beginning of the}} game, depositing it in Hell. The marine pursues Betruger through the labs, but is pulled into the main teleportation portal after being lured into a trap by Betruger.|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} a number of studies linking {{psychological}} <b>distress</b> with <b>the</b> demand for medical care. The importance of these studies lies in the finding that <b>the</b> <b>distressed</b> use of services more frequently than the non-distressed. To the extent that many of the visits of <b>the</b> <b>distressed</b> are for medically trivial reasons, which is the most frequent interpretation of this finding, there may be an argument in favor of cost containment strategies aimed at diverting <b>the</b> <b>distressed</b> away from seeking 'unneeded' medical attention. There are, however, a number of difficulties both with most of the studies that have been done to date and with how the finding of more frequent visits among <b>the</b> <b>distressed</b> is interpreted. <b>The</b> present study examines the reporting of illnesses, disability per illness reported, patient initiated physician visits per illness reported and physicians' judgement regarding the medical necessity of the visits reported for a representative sample of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The 950 respondents in this analysis were divided into groups by three levels of psychological distress. Illnesses reported both prospectively and retrospectively to the measurement of psychological <b>distress</b> are analyzed. <b>The</b> data indicate that, although <b>the</b> <b>distressed</b> report more illnesses, they are no more likely either to report disability per illness or to initiate medical care per illness. Further, <b>the</b> <b>distressed</b> are no more likely either to initiate unnecessary physician visits or to avoid initiating necessary visits. The implications of these findings for the impact of cost containment strategies on equity in the delivery of medical services are discussed. psychological distress care seeking illness reporting...|$|R

40|$|Bankruptcy-related costs may be {{categorized}} into four areas: (1) Real {{costs borne by}} <b>the</b> <b>distressed</b> firm; (2) Real costs borne directly by the claimants; (3) Losses to <b>the</b> <b>distressed</b> firm that are offset by gains to other entities; (4) Real costs borne by parties other than <b>the</b> <b>distressed</b> firm or its claimants. Cost categories 1, 2, and 3 are relevant for claimants, while Categories 1, 2, and 4 are relevant for society. Focusing on the first three categories, the present study reaches the following conclusions: First, after allowing for their costs of collections, claimsholders recover approximately 56 % of the bankrupt firm’s predistress value (PDV). Second, dealing with financial distress generally consumes between 12 % and 20 % of <b>the</b> <b>distressed</b> firm’s PDV. Taking the midpoint of this range (16 %) implies that the losses that lead to <b>the</b> firm’s <b>distress</b> average approximately 28 % of its PDV.

Because of its impact on risk premiums, the cost of capital and needed tax rates, the cost of dealing with financial distress has an adverse impact on resourc...|$|R
