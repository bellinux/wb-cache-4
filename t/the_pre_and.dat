As further evidence, he observes that the Urdu sources of <b>the</b> <b>pre</b> <b>and</b> post-rebellion periods usually refer to the British not as angrez (the English), goras (whites) or firangis (foreigners), but as kafir (infidels) and nasrani (Christians).|$|E
25|$|After the 2013 season, the Dodgers {{ended their}} {{broadcast}} agreements with Prime Ticket and KCAL-TV. They entered into {{an agreement with}} Time Warner Cable {{to start their own}} regional sports network, to be called SportsNet LA, to begin with the 2014 season. This marked the end of over-the-air broadcasts of Dodger games, which had begun in 1949. On October 12, 2013, they announced {{that they would not be}} retaining the broadcasting team of Steve Lyons and Eric Collins who had worked road games for the team since 2005 (Lyons) and 2009 (Collins). On December 2, 2013, the team announced that former Dodger Nomar Garciaparra would be part of the new broadcast team. On December 8, it was announced that Orel Hershiser would also be joining the broadcast team as a television game analyst for road games and that Alanna Rizzo would be joining <b>the</b> <b>pre</b> <b>and</b> post game shows. On December 11, Jerry Hairston, Jr. announced that he was retiring from baseball to join the Dodgers pre and post game broadcasting team. On January 22, 2014, it was announced that KLAC radio announcer Charley Steiner would move to the TV booth to call road games with Hershiser, while Garciaparra would call road radio broadcasts with Rick Monday. Vin Scully, in his 65th year with the Dodgers, would continue to call all home telecasts as well as road games from Arizona and San Francisco. The new network officially launched on February 25, 2014. However, a season long dispute between Time Warner Cable and other content providers, most notably DirecTV, led to the new channel only being available in homes that were served by Time Warner Cable itself.|$|E

500|$|According to Romanian sources, [...] "Cliché (Hush Hush)" [...] is a [...] "dynamic" [...] dance-pop {{track that}} {{incorporates}} influences of Eurodance into its sound; its lyrics speak about love. About {{the message of}} the song, Stan confessed that it [...] "shows love in different ways and portrays as well relationships between obvious couples, which fall into a certain pattern. Love can transform everyone and everything in the most wonderful and important thing in the universe". Alvaro from Spanish music website Popelera pointed out major differences between the dance style of the track and that of its predecessor, [...] "Lemoande" [...] (2012), while Mia, writing for Romanian portal Info Music, drew comparisons with the Pussycat Dolls' single [...] "Hush Hush; Hush Hush" [...] (2009). Kevin Apaza of Direct Lyrics implied that Stan [...] " [...] away from her 'signature' (very saxobeat) sound to test other 'dance' waters", and wrote that the song [...] "ain't very catchy but [...] <b>the</b> <b>pre</b> <b>and</b> the main chorus.

2500|$|Nesting is annual with single, overwintered foundresses {{initiating}} new nests in spring. The overwintering {{period is}} about 4.5 months. Later, in {{roughly half of}} the cases, one or more additional females come to form multiple foundress colonies and join these initial foundresses. Foundress associations of up to 16 foundresses can be formed. A dominance hierarchy then forms with the dominant female becoming the queen and the others becoming subordinates. The queen helps build and initiate the nest at first, during <b>the</b> <b>pre</b> <b>and</b> post emergence periods, but then becomes lethargic. She stops foraging for pulp and ceases her aid in the nest construction. At {{the end of the}} season, the female queen leaves the nest for the winter and returns the following year to create a new colony.|$|E
2500|$|The neural arches of {{the neck}} {{vertebrae}} were well-fused to the centra, leaving no visible sutures, and the neural canal was narrow in the front vertebrae, becoming more prominently developed in the hind vertebrae, where it was as broad as high, and almost circular. <b>The</b> <b>pre</b> <b>and</b> post zygapophyses {{of the neck}} vertebrae, processes that articulate adjacent vertebrae so they fit together, were of equal length; the former reached entirely over {{the level of the}} centrum, whereas the latter reached only with their back half. The neural spines of the neck vertebrae appear to have been low, and almost semi-circular by the 20th vertebra. The facets where the neck ribs articulated with the neck vertebrae were placed on the lower sides of the centra, but were only placed higher in the last three vertebrae, reaching around the middle of the sides. The neck ribs were semicircular to quadratic in side view, and were directed rather straight down. The bottom of each neck vertebrae had pairs of nutritive foramina (openings) at the middle, separated by a ridge, which became progressively more prominent and thickened towards the back of the neck.|$|E
