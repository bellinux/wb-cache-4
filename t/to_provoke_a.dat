5|$|On {{the night}} of June 14, while the Lithuanian {{government}} was discussing the ultimatum, Soviet soldiers began actions at the border. They fired shots at a border post near Alytus and killed policeman Aleksas Barauskas. At other points the Soviets interrogated Lithuanian border guards and harassed civilians, hoping <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>a</b> retaliation that {{would serve as a}} rationale for a full-scale military attack.|$|E
5|$|Posner also {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} the defendants were removing the painting to save Chicago from racial riots that the continued showing of the painting might have started, and in which it might have been destroyed. He found that Tillman herself threatened to burn the painting on the spot, {{and that there was no}} mob. In addition, the court found that because Nelson had not intended <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>a</b> riot, the First Amendment could still be used to protect his speech.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 29, Michael Johnson {{was engaged}} to be married to a local woman, Mary Neild, but she {{cancelled}} the engagement. Twenty years later, in 1706, he married Sarah Ford. She came from a middle-class milling and farming family and was twelve years his junior, daughter of Cornelius Ford. Although both families had money, Samuel Johnson often claimed that he grew up in poverty. It is uncertain what happened between the marriage of his parents and Samuel's birth three years later <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>a</b> decline in the family's fortunes, but Michael Johnson quickly became overwhelmed with debt from which he was never able to recover.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1860s, Levski {{developed}} a revolutionary theory that saw the Bulgarian liberation movement as an armed uprising of all Bulgarians in the Ottoman Empire. The insurrection was to be prepared, controlled and coordinated internally by a central revolutionary organisation, which was to include local revolutionary committees in all parts of Bulgaria and operate independently from any foreign factors. Levski's theory resulted from the repeated failures to implement Rakovski's ideas effectively, {{such as the use of}} foreign-based armed detachments (чети, cheti) <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>a</b> general revolt. Levski's idea of an entirely independent revolution did not enjoy the approval of the entire population either—in fact, he was the only prominent Bulgarian revolutionary to advocate it. Instead, many regarded an intervention by the great powers as a more feasible solution.|$|E
5|$|Henry invaded {{again in}} July 1106, hoping <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>a</b> decisive battle. After some initial {{tactical}} successes, he turned south-west towards the castle of Tinchebray. He besieged the castle and Duke Robert, supported by Robert of Bellême, advanced from Falaise to relieve it. After attempts at negotiation failed, the Battle of Tinchebray took place, probably on 28 September. The battle lasted around an hour, and {{began with a}} charge by Duke Robert's cavalry; the infantry and dismounted knights of both sides then joined the battle. Henry's reserves, led by Elias, the Count of Maine and Alan, the Duke of Brittany, attacked the enemy's flanks, routing first Bellême's troops and then {{the bulk of the}} ducal forces. Duke Robert was taken prisoner, but Bellême escaped.|$|E
5|$|In September 1898, Hannah was {{committed}} to Cane Hill mental asylum – she had developed a psychosis seemingly brought on by an infection of syphilis and malnutrition. For the two months she was there, Chaplin and his brother Sydney were sent {{to live with their}} father, whom the young boys scarcely knew. Charles Sr. was by then a severe alcoholic, and life there was bad enough <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>a</b> visit from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Chaplin's father died two years later, at 38 years old, from cirrhosis of the liver.|$|E

5|$|Primarily {{the brainchild}} of General Nguyen Chi Thanh, the {{upcoming}} offensive would be timed <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>a</b> popular general uprising among the South Vietnamese people against the government and its American supporters. Yet prudence required that the South Vietnamese maintain 50 per cent of their forces on standby, while American and allied forces under General William Westmoreland—the Free World Military Forces—remained on full alert. However, despite such measures the fighting at Khe Sanh had largely succeeded in diverting American resources and attention away from Saigon and towards the demilitarized zone, affording the communists the element of surprise.|$|E
5|$|The Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition was a {{diplomatic}} mission to Afghanistan {{sent by the}} Central Powers in 1915–1916. The purpose was to encourage Afghanistan to declare full independence from the British Empire, enter World War I {{on the side of}} the Central Powers, and attack British India. The expedition was part of the Hindu–German Conspiracy, a series of Indo-German efforts <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>a</b> nationalist revolution in India. Nominally headed by the exiled Indian prince Raja Mahendra Pratap, the expedition was a joint operation of Germany and Turkey and was led by the German Army officers Oskar Niedermayer and Werner Otto von Hentig. Other participants included members of an Indian nationalist organisation called the Berlin Committee, including Maulavi Barkatullah and Chempakaraman Pillai, while the Turks were represented by Kazim Bey, a close confidante of Enver Pasha.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{initially}} denied {{knowledge of}} the incident, but later admitted shooting down the aircraft, claiming that {{it was on a}} MASINT spy mission. The Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union said it was a deliberate provocation by the United States to probe the Soviet Union's military preparedness, or even <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>a</b> war. The White House accused the Soviet Union of obstructing search and rescue operations. The Soviet Armed Forces suppressed evidence sought by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) investigation, such as the flight recorders, which were released eight years later, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of January, 1894 a meeting of the Central Committee of the Fasci took place in Palermo to discuss the {{position}} of the movement. Two sharply contrasting positions emerged. De Felice Giuffrida, known for his anarchist tendencies, supported the need {{to take advantage of the}} situation of unrest <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>a</b> revolution on the island. However, the majority took an opposite view, arguing the need to proceed peacefully. A revolt was not only inappropriate, but it would be detrimental to the movement. The meeting condemned the violent incidents in various parts of the island, and launched an appeal to stay calm and not to retaliate. In the end De Felice Giuffrida accepted the position of the majority. But the die was cast for the authorities to arrest De Felice, Montalto, Petrina, and others. Garibaldi Bosco, Barbato and Verro were arrested on board the steamship Bagnara that was about to leave for Tunis.|$|E
5|$|Normandy {{continued}} to disintegrate into chaos. In 1105, Henry sent his friend Robert Fitzhamon and {{a force of}} knights into the Duchy, apparently <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>a</b> confrontation with Duke Robert. Fitzhamon was captured, and Henry used this {{as an excuse to}} invade, promising to restore peace and order. Henry had the support of most of the neighbouring counts around Normandy's borders, and King Philip of France was persuaded to remain neutral. Henry occupied western Normandy, and advanced east on Bayeux, where Fitzhamon was held. The city refused to surrender, and Henry besieged it, burning it to the ground. Terrified of meeting the same fate, the town of Caen switched sides and surrendered, allowing Henry to advance on Falaise, which he took with some casualties. Henry's campaign stalled, and the King instead began peace discussions with Robert. The negotiations were inconclusive and the fighting dragged on until Christmas, when Henry returned to England.|$|E
5|$|Perturbed {{by those}} who betrayed fellow members to the French and the {{problems}} this behaviour caused, Học convened a meeting to tighten regulations in mid-1929 at the village of Lac Dao, along the Gia Lam–Haiphong railway. This was also the occasion for a shift in strategy: Học argued for a general uprising, citing rising discontent among Vietnamese soldiers in the colonial army. More moderate party leaders believed this move to be premature, and cautioned against it, but Học's stature meant he prevailed in shifting the party's orientation towards violent struggle. One of the arguments presented for large-scale violence was that the French response to the Bazin assassination meant that the party's strength could decline in the long term. The plan was <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>a</b> series of uprisings at military posts around the Red River Delta in early 1930, where VNQDD forces would join Vietnamese soldiers in {{an attack on the}} two major northern cities of Hanoi and Haiphong. The leaders agreed to restrict their uprisings to Tonkin, because the party was weak elsewhere.|$|E

50|$|Another {{approach}} has been taking the conserved domains identified from these projects, and delivering groups of these antigens <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>an</b> immune response; various approaches with different antigens, presented different ways (as fusion proteins, mounted on virus-like particles, on non-pathogenic viruses, as DNA, and others), are under development.|$|R
50|$|Immunogenicity is {{the ability}} of a {{particular}} substance, such as an antigen or epitope, <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>an</b> immune response in the body of a human or animal.

5|$|Throughout 1915 Mexican insurgents {{raided the}} Texas border region {{as part of}} the Plan of San Diego. Supported by the Mexican Carranza government, a group of raiders known as the Seditionistas {{attacked}} American military and commercial interests along the United States–Mexican border in an effort <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>a</b> race war in the Southwestern United States with aims of returning the area to Mexican control. Charged with guarding the border, American General Frederick Funston had 20,000 troops to pit against the few hundred Seditionista insurgents. Nonetheless, the Mexicans never raided in force and the long border was difficult for Funston to fully protect. The Seditionista raids became such a threat to the Americans in the Big Bend area that local vigilante groups were formed in order to repel the Mexican raiders as Funston did not have enough troops {{to ensure the safety of}} the American citizens living in the area.|$|E
5|$|Tillman believed, {{and often}} stated as senator, that blacks must submit to either white {{domination}} or extermination. He {{was reluctant to}} undertake the latter, fearing hundreds of whites would die accomplishing it. He campaigned in the violent 1898 North Carolina elections, in which white Democrats were determined to take back control from a biracial Populist-Republican coalition elected in 1894 and 1896 on a fusion ticket. He spoke widely in North Carolina {{in the fall of}} 1898, often to crowds wearing red shirts, disheartening his Populist supporters. Terror and intimidation again won the day for the Democrats, who were elected statewide. They failed to win in the coastal city of Wilmington, but white supremacists took over by force. South Carolina saw violence as well: an effort to register black voters in Phoenix led whites <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>a</b> confrontation, after which a number of African Americans were murdered. Tillman warned African Americans and those who might combine with them that black political activism would provoke a murderous response from whites.|$|E
5|$|With Piper's departure, Paul McDermott, who {{performed}} {{at one of}} DAAS's regular clubs, was invited to join. He accepted, {{although he did not}} like their material, which he considered too sweet. Fidler says McDermott changed the group's dynamic; he wrote the majority of their songs and prompted a darker tone. After winning the Pick of the Fringe award at the 1986 Adelaide Fringe Festival, the group relocated from Canberra to Melbourne, where they based themselves with a regular gig at the Prince Patrick Hotel in Collingwood, in an effort to save enough money to travel to the Edinburgh Fringe. Initially DAAS found that Melbourne audiences did not respond to their act and <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>a</b> reaction they became more aggressive, with McDermott and Ferguson adopting more abusive personas and often picking on Fidler's naturally happy but stupid character. They made their first overseas performance at the Edinburgh Fringe in 1987, to sold out crowds.|$|E
60|$|Ralph was {{far from}} being as {{positive}} that they would find the horses at the Kenniston farm as his friend was, but he contented himself with waiting until it could be proven, rather than <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>an</b> argument when it seemed that, under any circumstances, they had better return there.|$|R

5|$|Although {{unknown to}} the Australians at the time, the earlier attack on Lang Phuoc Hai had been a {{deliberate}} attempt by the Viet Cong <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>a</b> reaction from 1 ATF. As such {{there would be no}} withdrawal on this occasion. Anticipating that any relief force would move by road, the Viet Cong had subsequently established an extensive ambush in the buildings alongside Route 44, which led into the village itself. Although the presence of this trap was not detected by the Australians, Murphy's evasion had ensured that his APCs had avoided it, moving the infantry by a cross-country route instead. However, with C Company delayed as a result, A Company made their airmobile assault onto an unsecured landing zone at 13:45, supported only by indirect fire from the artillery at Dat Do in suppression, which was initially limited due to delay in setting up the fire support base. Under the command of Major Owen O'Brien, A Company then began to advance into the fringe of thick rainforest to secure the southern edge of the landing zone for the arrival of B Company and the remainder of the battalion. Finally, over 30 minutes after the lead company had flown in, the APCs began to receive sniper fire as they neared the landing zone.|$|E
5|$|However, {{with the}} war {{approaching}} a stalemate strategically, the Australians were substantially reinforced following the trend of further American troop increases, with a third infantry battalion arriving in December, while a squadron of Centurion tanks and additional Iroquois helicopters were added in early 1968. Total Australian strength in Vietnam grew to over 8,000 men, its highest level during the war, effectively doubling the combat power available to the task force commander. Likewise, American military strength in Vietnam had risen to 486,000 men while South Vietnamese forces had expanded to 643,000 {{by the end of}} the year. In spite of this build up North Vietnamese strength in South Vietnam also increased growing to 278,000 men, and although communist strategy remained fundamentally one of protracted war, preparations for a strategic offensive had reached an advanced stage. Culminating in the Tet Offensive in early 1968, the offensive would aim <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>a</b> popular general uprising among the South Vietnamese people against the government and its American supporters and would take the form of a massive simultaneous surprise attack on population centres throughout South Vietnam. 1 ATF would be heavily involved in the fighting during Tet, deploying astride communist lines of communication in support of American and South Vietnamese forces defending the Long Binh-Bien Hoa complex north-east of Saigon during Operation Coburg, while also repelling repeated Viet Cong attacks against Ba Ria and Long Dien in Phuoc Tuy province.|$|E
5|$|Two {{important}} legal {{decisions in}} the 1930s helped increase the accessibility of contraceptives. In 1930, two condom manufacturers sued {{each other in the}} Youngs Rubber case, and the judge ruled that contraceptive manufacturing was a legitimate business enterprise. He went further, and declared that the federal law prohibiting the mailing of condoms was not legally sound. Sanger precipitated a second legal breakthrough when she ordered a diaphragm from Japan in 1932, hoping <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>a</b> decisive battle in the courts. The diaphragm was confiscated by the U.S. government, and Sanger's subsequent legal challenge led to the 1936 One Package legal ruling by Judge Augustus Hand. His decision overturned an important provision of the anti-contraception laws that prohibited physicians from obtaining contraceptives.Rose, Melody, Abortion: A Documentary and Reference Guide, ABC-CLIO, 2008, p. 29.Tone, p. 178: Tone calls the ruling a coup d'etat for Sanger. This court victory motivated the American Medical Association in 1937 to finally adopt contraception as a normal medical service and a core component of medical school curricula.. Retrieved 15 October 2011. However, the medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources until the 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|One {{problem for}} {{understanding}} action selection is determining {{the level of}} abstraction used for specifying an [...] "act".

50|$|Cat breeds {{such as the}} LaPerm, Sphynx, Devon Rex and Cornish Rex, which lack {{some or all of}} {{the normal}} layers in cats' fur, are {{believed}} by mild allergy sufferers to be significantly less likely <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> <b>an</b> allergic reaction than other breeds.
