However, {{the role of the}} DNA associated with the activated toxin in the mechanism of action of <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> toxin has long been ignored. Here, we focused on <b>the</b> DNA-activated <b>Cry</b> toxin complex. Both forms of <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> 8 Ca 2 and Cry 8 Ea 1 toxins, i. e., with or without bound DNA, were separately obtained. Size-exclusion chromatography analysis indicated that <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> 8 Ca 2 toxin-DNA complex has a tight or compact structure. <b>The</b> <b>Cry</b> 8 Ca 2 toxin-DNA complex is more likely to move toward the air/water interface and is more hydrophobic than the toxin without DNA. Competitive binding assays indicated that <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> 8 Ca 2 and Cry 8 Ea 1 toxins without DNA specifically bind to the midgut of Anomala corpulenta and Holotrichia parallela larvae, respectively. In contrast, the association of DNA with each toxin might result in the nonspecific recognition of <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> toxin and its target receptor in the insect midgut. The association of the DNA fragment with <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> 8 toxin was shown to protect <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> protein from digestion by proteases. Based on our results, we propose an additional step in the mechanism of action of <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> 8 toxin and elucidate the function of the associated DNA as well as the importance of the removal of this DNA for the insecticidal activity of the toxin...|$|R

A total of six cry genes were detected in genomic DNA purified from HD- 133, four from <b>the</b> <b>cry</b> 1 family (cry 1 Aa, cry 1 Ab, cry 1 C, and cry 1 D) as well as a gene each from <b>the</b> <b>cry</b> 2 (cry 2 B) and <b>the</b> <b>cry</b> 1 I families. To directly determine which genes were expressed and crystallized in the purified parasporal inclusions, solubilized and trypsinized HD- 133 crystals were subjected to chromatographic separation by HPLC. Only three proteins, Cry 1 Ab, Cry 1 C, and Cry 1 D, were found, in a 60 / 37 / 3 ratio. Dot blot analysis of total mRNA purified from HD- 133 showed that both <b>the</b> <b>cry</b> 2 B and cry 1 I genes, but not <b>the</b> <b>cry</b> 1 Aa gene, were transcribed. Cloning and sequencing of <b>the</b> <b>cry</b> 1 Aa gene revealed an inserted DNA sequence within <b>the</b> <b>cry</b> coding sequence, resulting in a disrupted reading frame.

25|$|In {{depression}} and grief syndromes, crying is typically {{a sign of}} sadness, whereas the pathological displays of crying which occur in PBA are often {{in contrast to the}} underlying mood, or greatly in excess of the mood or eliciting stimulus. In addition, a key to differentiating depression from PBA is duration: PBA episodes are sudden, occurring in a brief episodic manner, while crying in depression is a more sustained presentation and closely relates to the underlying mood state. The level of control that one has over <b>the</b> <b>crying</b> episodes in PBA is minimal or nonexistent, whereas for those suffering from depression, the emotional expression (typically crying) can be modulated by the situation. Similarly, the trigger for episodes of crying in patients with PBA may be nonspecific, minimal or inappropriate to the situation, but in depression the stimulus is specific to the mood-related condition. These differences are outlined in the adjacent Table.|$|E
25|$|Though its exact {{parameters}} remain debatable, {{from the}} early 1970s {{to the present day}} the most salient literary movement has been postmodernism. Thomas Pynchon, a seminal practitioner of the form, drew in his work on modernist fixtures such as temporal distortion, unreliable narrators, and internal monologue and coupled them with distinctly postmodern techniques such as metafiction, ideogrammatic characterization, unrealistic names (Oedipa Maas, Benny Profane, etc.), absurdist plot elements and hyperbolic humor, deliberate use of anachronisms and archaisms, a strong focus on postcolonial themes, and a subversive commingling of high and low culture. In 1973, he published Gravity's Rainbow, a leading work in this genre, which won the National Book Award and was unanimously nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction that year. His other major works include his debut, V. (1963), <b>The</b> <b>Crying</b> of Lot 49 (1966), Mason & Dixon (1997), and Against the Day (2006).|$|E
25|$|On Hesselberg {{all forms}} (high forest, coppice-with-standards, coppice) and types (temperate {{coniferous}} forest, mixed forest, deciduous forest) of forests can be found. The coppice {{in the upper}} regions of the northern slope has the strangest appearance. After coppicing more light reaches the ground and thermophile animals such as the sand lizard thrive. Later, when the canopy closes again, many other specialised animals such as the Eurasian woodcock find a suitable habitat. All game that is typical of German forests (for example hare, roe, red fox, and squirrel) are present in Hesselberg's woods. The drumming of woodpeckers and <b>the</b> <b>crying</b> of cuckoos contribute to {{the mood of the}} wood as well as the singing of countless birds. Various Ranunculaceae—such as liverworts and wood anemones—are the signs of spring in Hesselberg's forests. In May ramsons turn the ground of the deciduous forest into a carpet of green and white blooms. After blooming the intense odour of garlic fills the air. The various species of orchids such as the red helleborine have become increasingly rare. The Turk's-cap lily, which belongs to the lily family, can still be found relatively often but flower's diversity is in need of protection. The erica and the Cytisus scoparius prefer the iron sandstone layers of the lower parts of the slopes.|$|E
