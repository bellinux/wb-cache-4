40|$|ABSTRACT In the Netherlands, the {{national}} government is committed towards altering the systems of energy, transport and agriculture {{in the name of}} sustainable development. A process of deliberation and change was started—aimed at achieving ‘transitions’—using a model of transition management. This paper examines how the new arrangements of governance for energy <b>transition</b> <b>deal</b> with six problems of steering: ambivalence about goals, uncertainty about cause–effect relations, distributed power of control, political myopia, determination of short-term steps for long-term change and the danger of lock-in to new systems. The Dutch experience shows that transition management is applied in ways different from the original model (established players play a too great role) but it appears a useful model of reflexive governance, combining advantages of incremental politics with those of planning. It helps to orientate innovation policy and sectoral policies to sustainable development goals and to exploit business interests in system innovations in a prudent manner...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: During {{the last}} decade of this century the {{countries}} in transition (CIT) have undergone numerous changes in the field of the entire political, economic and social life. In restructuring process of their own economies, countries in <b>transition</b> <b>deal</b> with many common problems. In the analyzed period from 1993 to 1996 there was improvement in the economic situation in the countries in transition which is reflected on the higher rates of increase in GDP, increase in GDP per capita, {{as well as on the}} decrease in inflation and unemployment, which gives evidence of the efficiency of the transition process. One of the problems that transition brought to those countries is deficit in current account, as well as budget deficit. Deficits represent limit to a healthy and fast economic development and progress. Balance in balance of payments, as well as balanced budget are components of macroeconomic system. In the observed period there was deterioration in the balance of the current transaction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Transition rules with {{negative}} premises {{are needed in}} the structural operational semantics of programming and specification con-structs such as priority and interrupt, {{as well as in}} timed extensions of specification languages. The well-known proof-theoretic semantics for transition system specifications involving such rules is based on well-supported proofs for closed <b>transitions.</b> <b>Dealing</b> with open formulae by considering all closed instances is inherently non-modular – proofs are not necessarily preserved by disjoint extensions of the transition system specification. Here, we conservatively extend the notion of well-supported proof to open transition rules. We prove that the resulting semantics is modular, consis-tent, and closed under instantiation. Our results provide the foundations for modular notions of bisimulation such that equivalence can be proved with reference only to the relevant rules, without appealing to all existing closed instantiations of terms. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} probabilistic-timed version of Lotos (PTLotos) for specifying and verifying the Alternating Bit Protocol (ABP). First, we present the {{language}} which is an upward compatible version of Lotos where some new operators to deal with time and probabilistic features have been included. We give an operational semantics, where {{there are two kinds}} of transitions: probabilistic transitions and timed transitions. Transitions of the first kind are associated with the events that a behavior expression can execute, while timed <b>transitions</b> <b>deal</b> with time evolution. From this operational semantics we define a testing semantics, where a process passes a test with a probability in a period of time, and two processes are intended to be equivalent if they pass all the tests with the same probability for any time. In the second part of the paper, we use PTLotos in order to specify the Alternating Bit Protocol. The ABP is a simple communication protocol which provides an error free co [...] ...|$|R

We study a generalization of the two-species Eden model, which incorporates local frequency-dependent selection, in order to analyze how social interactions between two species influence surface roughness of growing microbial colonies. The model includes several classical scenarios from game theory. We then concentrate on an expanding public goods game, where either cooperators or defectors take over the front depending on the system parameters. We analyze in detail the critical behavior of the nonequilibrium phase transition between global cooperation and defection and thereby identify a new universality class of phase <b>transitions</b> <b>dealing</b> with absorbing states.

40|$|Entanglement and {{violation}} of Bell inequalities are aspects of quantum nonlocality {{that have been}} often confused in the past. It is now known that this equivalence is only true for pure states. Even though almost all the studies of quantum correlations at quantum phase <b>transitions</b> <b>deal</b> only with entanglement, we here argue that Bell inequalities can also reveal a general quantum phase transition. This is also shown for a particular case of two spin- 1 / 2 particles in an infinite one-dimensional chain described by the XXZ model. In this case, the Bell inequality is able to signal not only the first-order phase transition, but also the infinite-order Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition, which cannot be revealed either by {{the energy of the}} system nor by the bipartite entanglement. We also show that although the nearest-neighbor spins are entangled, they, unexpectedly, never violate the Bell inequality. This indicates that the type of entanglement which is relevant for quantum phase transition is not trivial, i. e., it cannot be revealed by the Bell inequality. Comment: Published version.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a sharp {{analysis of the}} optimally tuned denoising problem and establishes a relation between the estimation error (minimax risk) and phase transition for compressed sensing recovery using convex and continuous functions. Phase <b>transitions</b> <b>deal</b> with recovering a signal xo from compressed linear observations Ax_ 0 by minimizing a certain convex function f(·). On the other hand, denoising {{is the problem of}} estimating a signal x_ 0 from noisy observations y = x_ 0 +z using the regularization min_x λ/f(x) + 1 / 2 ∥y-x∥_ 2 ^ 2. In general, these problems are more meaningful and useful when the signal x_ 0 has a certain structure and the function f(·) is chosen to exploit this structure. Examples include, l_ 1 and l_ 1 - l_ 2 norms for sparse and block sparse vectors and nuclear norm for low rank matrices. In this work, we carefully analyze the minimax denoising problem and relate our results to the phase transition performance under a considerably general setting where the measurement A in compressed recovery and the noise z in the denoising problem are iid Gaussian random variables. Our results suggest that the required number of observations to recover a compressed signal is closely related to the asymptotic variance of the optimal estimation error. This relation was first empirically noted in [9]. Here we provide a rigorous foundation...|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} that dipolar and weak superexchange {{interactions}} between the spin systems of single-molecule magnets (SMM) {{play an important role}} in the relaxation of magnetization. These interactions can reduce or increase resonant tunneling. The one-body tunnel picture of SMMs is not always sufficient to explain the measured tunnel transitions. We propose to improve the picture by including also two-body tunnel transitions such as spin-spin cross-relaxation (SSCR). A Mn 4 SMM is used as a model system to study the SSCR which plays also an important role for other SMMs like Mn 12 or Fe 8. At certain external fields, SSCRs can lead to quantum resonances which can show up in hysteresis loop measurements as well defined steps.
