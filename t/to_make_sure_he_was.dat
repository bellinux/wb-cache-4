5|$|Former British {{soldier and}} writer Ken Wharton {{published}} {{in his book}} Wasted Years, Wasted Lives, Volume 1, an alternative theory that was suggested to him by loyalist paramilitarism researcher Jeanne Griffin; this was that the ambush was planned by Robin Jackson as an elaborate means of eliminating trumpet player Brian McCoy. Griffin suggests that McCoy, who originally came from Caledon, County Tyrone and had strong UDR and Orange Order family connections, was possibly approached at some stage by Jackson {{with a view of}} securing his help in carrying out UVF attacks in the Irish Republic. When McCoy refused, Jackson then hatched his plan to murder McCoy and his bandmates in retaliation, even macabrely choosing Buskhill as the ambush site due to its similarity to Bus-kill. Griffin goes on to add that the bogus checkpoint was set up not only to plant the bomb on board the van but to ensure the presence of McCoy which would have been confirmed when he handed over his driver's license to the gunmen. She also thinks that had everything gone to plan once the bomb was planted in the van McCoy would have been instructed to drive through Newry where the bomb would have gone off and the UVF could then afterwards portray the Miami Showband as IRA members on a mission to blow up the local RUC barracks. Griffin based her theory on the nine bullets that were fired from a Luger into McCoy's body and that Jackson's fingerprints were found on the silencer used for a Luger. She furthermore opined that Jackson was the man Travers saw kicking McCoy's body <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dead.|$|E
25|$|Agents {{with the}} U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{investigating}} Ross Ulbricht, {{founder of the}} online black market Silk Road, learned that he often ran the site from his laptop, using the wireless networks available at branches of the San Francisco Public Library. When they had enough evidence to arrest him, they planned to catch him {{in the act of}} running Silk Road, with his computer on and logged in. They needed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not able to trigger any encryption or delete evidence when they did.|$|E
25|$|Claude {{was known}} as the singing killer. Keep in mind that there was another Claude Dubois at the time whose career was purely musical. Claude was a nightclub singer in his spare time and was {{acknowledged}} as the singer of the Montreal organization. When he was young he started out by working as a door-man for the Mafia, which gave him a foot in the door of the criminal underworld as the Cotroni began to weaken it allowed him to expand his work into strip clubs and bars. He ran his empire very efficiently and would insure regular meetings <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> on top of everything. Claude was very active in the downtown drug trafficking trade along with his brother Adrien. At the end of Claude’s career he was sentenced to 25 years for the murder of Cotroni’s brother-in-law in 1973.|$|E

25|$|According to his autobiography, Oh My, Dick Enberg (then {{the lead}} play-by-play voice for The NFL on NBC) was {{informed}} by NBC {{that he would}} become the lead play-by-play voice of the Major League Baseball Game of the Week beginning with the 1982 World Series (sharing the play-by-play duties for that game with Joe Garagiola, alongside analyst Tony Kubek) and through subsequent regular seasons. Enberg wrote that on his football trips, he would read every edition of The Sporting News <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> current with all the baseball news and notes. He then met with NBC executives in September 1982, who informed him that Vin Scully was in negotiations to be their lead baseball play-by-play announcer (teaming with Garagiola, while Kubek would team with Bob Costas) and would begin with the network {{in the spring of}} 1983. Therefore, rather than throw him in randomly for one World Series, Enberg wrote that he hosted the pre-game/post-game shows while the team of Joe Garagiola and Tony Kubek did the games. According to the book, Enberg was not pleased about the decision (since he loved being the California Angels' radio voice in the 1970s and was eager to return to baseball) but the fact that NBC was bringing in Scully, arguably baseball's best announcer, was understandable. Enberg added that NBC also gave him a significant pay increase as a pseudo-apology for not coming through on the promise to make him the lead baseball play-by-play announcer.|$|E

Kloves described {{the film as}} being [...] "really faithful" [...] to the book. He added dialogue, of which Rowling approved.

500|$|Bassist Stephen Travers {{was seriously}} wounded by a dum-dum bullet which had struck {{him when the}} gunmen had first begun shooting. He survived by pretending he was dead, as he lay beside the body of McCoy. Saxophone player Des McAlea was hit by the minibus's door when it was blown off in the explosion, but was not badly wounded. He lay hidden in thick undergrowth, undetected by the gunmen. He also survived. However, the flames from the burning hedge (which had been set on fire by the explosion) soon came dangerously close to where he lay; {{he was forced to}} leave his hiding spot. By this time the gunmen had left the scene, {{assuming}} everyone else had been killed. Travers later recalled hearing one of the departing gunmen tell his comrade who had kicked McCoy's body <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not alive: [...] "Come on, those bastards are dead. I got them with dum-dums". McAlea made his way up the embankment to the main road where he hitched a lift to alert the RUC at their barracks in Newry.|$|E

2500|$|Disturbed at his son's {{participation}} {{in what he}} considered a [...] "useless" [...] endeavor, Landis's father tried to discourage him from racing his bike by giving him extra chores. This left him no time to train during the day, so he would sneak {{out of the house}} at night to train, sometimes at 1 or 2 a.m. and often in the freezing cold. Landis's father received a tip that his son had been going out at night. He did not appreciate his son's passion for cycling and thought he might be getting into drugs or alcohol. He often followed Landis at a distance <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not getting into trouble. Landis' father later became a hearty supporter of his son and considered himself one of Floyd's biggest fans.|$|E
2500|$|In 1948, Michael Redgrave {{recommended}} Bikel to {{his friend}} Laurence Olivier as understudy for the parts of both Stanley Kowalski and Mitch in the West End premiere of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire. Bikel graduated from understudy to star opposite the director's wife, Vivien Leigh, with a sudden unplanned performance when a co-star, {{playing the role of}} Mitch, came down with a case of flu. Bikel showed up backstage and went directly to Leigh's dressing room to ask if she wanted to rehearse with him, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> right for the role. She replied that she did not need to: [...] "Go and do it," [...] she said. [...] "You are a professional, and Larry gave you this job because he trusted you to do it well." [...] After the show, Leigh told him, [...] "Well done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thirdly, {{the writing}} {{sessions}} {{were affected by}} Patrick's struggles with addiction, concerning alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs. While Patrick had struggled {{with it in the}} past, it became particularly bad upon dealing with the pressure of recording a follow-up to the platinum selling Title of Record. Patrick would stay up for multiple days at a time without sleep, spending entire days indulging in his addictions instead of working on the album. The album's first single, [...] "Where Do We Go From Here" [...] addressed said struggles; the track was self-referential in Patrick's struggles to create the album in the face of his addiction, knowing that the money being spent in the prolonged period, and the drugs being taken, were not sustainable activities. The track [...] "God Damn Me" [...] was written in between Patrick's blackouts one night when he was so heavily intoxictated that a friend kept on stopping in to wake him up <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> still alive. In 2013, Patrick would reflect on the writing sessions, stating [...] "I went through a music phase where I was writing as I experienced my life within drugs and alcohol....I cringe when I hear some of it {{because a lot of the}} lyrics I feel like ugh what was I thinking. There’s a lot of stuff I would have changed if I had been a little bit more clear headed." ...|$|E
