5|$|The Allies {{became aware}} of the Wizernes site in August 1943 when the Germans began laying {{extensive}} new rail sidings which were spotted by RAF reconnaissance flights. Late 1943, a Belgian, Jacques de Duve, supported by German opponents, informed MI5 about the existence of a rocket production site in Saint-Omer. MI5 did not believe Jacques de Duve, who was interned {{for the rest of the}} war in Latchmere House. In November 1943, the Allied Central Interpretation Unit reported that the Germans had begun constructing the concrete dome and were undertaking <b>tunnelling</b> <b>works</b> in the east face of the quarry. However, it was not until the following March that the Allies added the site to the list of targets for Operation Crossbow, the ongoing bombing campaign against V-weapon sites that had already wrecked the Watten bunker and numerous V-1 launching sites. Over the next few months, the USAAF and RAF carried out 16 air raids involving 811 bombers that dropped some 4,260 tons of bombs. The bombing caused destruction across a wide area, killing 55 residents of the nearby village of Helfault.|$|E

500|$|Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE), the {{successor}} to SELNEC, continued to examine possible rail link solutions. Light rail emerged in the early 1980s as a cost-effective option that could make use of existing railway lines and run through the city centre at street level, {{eliminating the need for}} costly <b>tunnelling</b> <b>works.</b> A Rail Study Group, composed of officials from British Rail, GMC and GMPTE formally endorsed the Project Light Rail scheme in 1984. Initial abstract proposals, based on light rail systems in North America and continental Europe, illustrated a draft [...] network consisting of three lines: Altrincham–/, Bury–/ and –. To promote the scheme, GMPTE held a public proof of concept demonstration in March 1987 using a Docklands Light Railway P86 train on a freight-only line adjacent to Debdale Park. The Project Light Rail proposals were presented to the UK Government for taxpayer funding; following route revisions in 1984 and 1987, Project Light Rail was approved. Because of central government's constraints on financial support for innovative transport projects, funding was granted by HM Treasury with the strict condition that the system be constructed in phases. Additional taxpayer funding came from the European Regional Development Fund and bank lending.|$|E

500|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939 did not initially cause much disruption in Gibraltar, as Spain and Italy were neutral at the time. The situation changed drastically after April 1940 when Germany invaded France, with Italy joining the invasion in June 1940. The British Government feared that Spain would also enter the war and {{it was decided to}} evacuate the entire civilian population of Gibraltar in May 1940. Most went to the United Kingdom and others to Madeira and Jamaica, while some made their own way to Tangier and Spain. An intensive programme of tunnelling and refortification was undertaken; over [...] of tunnels were dug in the Rock, and anti-aircraft batteries were installed in numerous locations in the territory. A new and powerful naval group called Force H was established at Gibraltar to control the entrance to the Mediterranean and support Allied forces in North Africa, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. The airfield, which was now designated RAF North Front, was also extended using soil from the <b>tunnelling</b> <b>works</b> so that it could accommodate bomber aircraft being ferried to North Africa. The garrison was greatly expanded, reaching a peak of 17,000 in 1943 with another 20,000 sailors and airmen accommodated in Gibraltar at the same time.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 August 2007, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) {{issued a}} stop-work order and revoked the contractor's {{tunnelling}} permit after a [...] stretch of two lanes sank about , {{close to the}} junction of Telok Blangah Road and Alexandra Road in the evening, resulting in a halting of <b>tunnelling</b> <b>works.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{total of}} 6 TBMs {{were used for}} work in the {{underground}} section of Phase 1. They were nicknamed Helen (TBM 1), Margarita (TBM 2), Kaveri (TBM 3), Krishna and Godavari.

2500|$|The {{network has}} been the subject of major {{upgrading}} works on a number of occasions. The most major of these were the Westfield Deviation of the North Island Main Trunk from Auckland to Westfield Junction via Panmure and Glen Innes, opened 1930, the Tawa Flat deviation in Wellington, opened 1937; the Rimutaka deviation to the Wairarapa, opened 1955; and the Kaimai deviation in the Bay of Plenty, opened 1978. All of these involved major <b>tunnelling</b> <b>works,</b> of close to [...] each in the two latter cases. Significant infrastructure improvements were also carried out on the North Island Main Trunk in the mid-1980s, some as part of the electrification scheme.|$|E

50|$|About 25 m of the {{rightmost}} two lanes on Bukit Timah Road {{has been}} closed off to traffic after a nearby drain embankment caved in on 17 January 2012 {{in the course of}} <b>tunnelling</b> <b>works</b> for the Downtown Line. Engineers found a 14m precast segment of the Bukit Timah canal wall near the junction of Bukit Timah Road and Clementi Road dislodged, and some gaps in the ground were formed around that segment of the canal. It then stopped its <b>tunnelling</b> <b>works</b> to ensure safety and has begun to inject cement to stabilise the ground.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of the 1980s, the {{decision}} was taken to build a tunnel to alleviate the congestion south of Högbergsgatan, and then to rebuild the existing northern <b>tunnel.</b> <b>Work</b> finished on schedule in January 1991.|$|R

50|$|Work progressed {{slowly and}} at {{significant}} expense. Industrial action spurred by ethnic tensions delayed the works, as did an injunction taken out by {{residents of the}} exclusive suburb of Woollahra to prevent round-the-clock <b>tunnelling</b> <b>works,</b> spawning a chain of legal action not completed in the High Court of Australia until 1982, some {{three years after the}} project was completed. With the coming to power of the Wran government in May 1976 a Board of Review of the Legislative Assembly was set up to examine the merits and feasibility of the Eastern Suburbs Railway project. Then, all <b>tunnelling</b> <b>works</b> had been completed to Bondi Junction and much of the track was laid, but the stations themselves were mostly incomplete. The Board was asked primarily whether the project continue or be abandoned yet again.|$|E

50|$|The {{rail link}} {{includes}} {{a total of}} 50km of tunnelling and underground alignment. The <b>tunnelling</b> <b>works</b> {{will be carried out}} along the Gombak-Bentong area where the single-longest twin hill-tunnel spanning 18km will be built under the Titiwangsa Mountains. There will also be several underground lines, including in the heavily-populated Gombak area near the Kuala Lumpur city centre.|$|E
50|$|The twin 2.25 km tunnels between Jalan Besar, Bendemeer and Geylang Bahru {{stations}} were bored under old pre-war shophouses along Jalan Besar Road and required careful and stringent {{control of the}} <b>tunnelling</b> <b>works</b> beneath it. The tunnels were constructed using steel-fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) segments, the first in South East Asia, which enhances the long term durability of the tunnels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tunnelling</b> <b>works</b> {{began on}} 8 June 2011. Two tunnel boring {{machines}} — which were named Athena and Artemis, after the Greek Goddesses by {{students of the}} nearby Pei Hwa Presbyterian Primary School, will tunnel the 1 km stretch from Beauty World to King Albert Park. The section of track between Hillview and Beauty World is the longest on the Downtown Line.|$|E

50|$|He was noticed for {{outstanding}} technical skills, so when king Vittorio Emanuele II {{decided to build}} the Mont Cenis Tunnel between Bardonecchia and Modane in 1857, Sommeiller was appointed head of design and construction. His collaborators were the Italian engineers Sebastiano Grandis and Severino Grattoni. He patented the pneumatic rock-drilling machine, used in the <b>tunnelling</b> <b>works,</b> based on the invention of Giovanni Battista Piatti.|$|E
50|$|Construction on the dam {{started in}} 1976, {{with funding from}} the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. Major {{redesign}} work was needed to address adjusted seismic criteria for the dam and <b>tunnelling</b> <b>works,</b> following the heavy 1976 earthquake. Additional costs were made to correct engineering errors, and to finance repairs to tunnel damage {{in the first year}} of operation, resulting in substantial over-budgeting. From the US$372.7 million calculated costs in 1978, the Chixoy project ended up costing US$944 million.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tunnelling</b> <b>works</b> {{under the}} city streets {{commenced}} in June 1972, using a tunnel boring machine built by Richmond engineering firm Jaques Limited,. as well as conventional boring methods. At North Melbourne, Spencer Street and Jolimont Yard, cut and cover tunnelling was used to build the access ramps, with the above ground running lines being slewed {{from time to time}} as work proceeded. The first completed tunnel was the Burnley Loop, with the final breakthrough made on 8 June 1977 near the Museum station site.|$|E
