5|$|Any Penrose tiling has local {{pentagonal}} symmetry, in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are {{points in}} the tiling surrounded by a symmetric configuration of tiles: such configurations have fivefold rotational symmetry about the center point, as well as five mirror lines of reflection symmetry passing through the point, a dihedral symmetry group. This symmetry will generally preserve only a patch of tiles around the center point, but the patch can be very large: Conway and Penrose proved that whenever the colored curves on the P2 or P3 tilings close in a loop, the region within the loop has pentagonal symmetry, and furthermore, in any tiling, there are at most two such curves of each color that do not close up.|$|E
5|$|In physics, mirror {{symmetry}} {{is justified}} on physical grounds. However, mathematicians generally require rigorous proofs {{that do not}} require an appeal to physical intuition. From a mathematical point of view, the version of mirror symmetry described above is still only a conjecture, but there is another version of mirror symmetry in the context of topological string theory, a simplified version of string theory introduced by Edward Witten, which has been rigorously proven by mathematicians. In the context of topological string theory, mirror symmetry states that two theories called the A-model and B-model are equivalent in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a duality relating them. Today mirror symmetry is an active area of research in mathematics, and mathematicians are working to develop a more complete mathematical understanding of mirror symmetry based on physicists' intuition.|$|E

25|$|This {{association}} is a duality in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{is a natural}} isomorphism between the double dual Avv and A (defined via the Poincaré bundle) {{and that it is}} contravariant functorial, i.e. it associates to all morphisms f: A → B dual morphisms fv: Bv → Av in a compatible way. The n-torsion of an abelian variety and the n-torsion of its dual are dual to each other when n is coprime to the characteristic of the base. In general - for all n - the n-torsion group schemes of dual abelian varieties are Cartier duals of each other. This generalises the Weil pairing for elliptic curves.|$|E

25|$|Integer factorization, which underpins the {{security}} of public key cryptographic systems, {{is believed to be}} computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few prime numbers (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes). By comparison, a quantum computer could efficiently solve this problem using Shor's algorithm to find its factors. This ability would allow a quantum computer to decrypt many of the cryptographic systems in use today, in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would be a polynomial time (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular public key ciphers are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the discrete logarithm problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular the RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.|$|E

500|$|An {{important}} feature of anti-de Sitter space is its boundary (which looks like a cylinder {{in the case of}} three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space).

500|$|During the 1999 {{parliamentary}} {{debate on the}} rule of law, Jeyaretnam asserted that detention without trial under the ISA contravened the doctrine as [...] "there {{is no way of}} checking the Minister's decision, who decides to make an order detaining a subject, depriving him of his liberty, completely contrary to the rule of natural justice and the fundamental principle that all men are free". He called for the provisions in the Act permitting such detention to be repealed, saying: [...] "The power is only necessary in emergency times when there is a real threat and so we do not need it any more. Let us for once realise that it is a violation of the Rule of Law. Let us be honest and repeal it." [...] Nominated Member of Parliament Simon Tay expressed the view that [...] "the ISA fulfills the Constitution as an exception. It does not fulfill the concept of the Rule of Law in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are only very limited grounds on which a court can review the decision of the Minister. It is in that sense a subjective discretion." [...] Nonetheless, he recognized that the ISA remained relevant, for instance, as a tool against people alleged to have engaged in espionage, and thus preventive detention could not be definitively declared right or wrong: [...] "It is a case-by-case decision, because that is how we live our lives in a real society." [...] Responding to Jeyaretnam, Ho Peng Kee noted that the justifications for the ISA had been fully debated in Parliament on previous occasions, and emphasized that there are safeguards in place to tackle the apparent arbitrariness of detentions under the Act, including a review of each detention by an advisory board composed of a Supreme Court judge and two prominent members of the public, and also the President's personal discretion to order a detainee's release in the event that the advisory board and Home Affairs Minister disagreed over the necessity for the detention.|$|E
