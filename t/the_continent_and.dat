5|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the mostly mild weather in the first few weeks of winter, the eastern half of the continent was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed the eastern half of <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> <b>and</b> brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E
5|$|The Madagascar women's {{national}} football team is the FIFA recognised senior women's A team for Madagascar. The team played their first FIFA matches in 2015. The {{development of a}} national team {{in the country is}} problematic because of issues found on <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> <b>and</b> on the island, specifically the lack of popularity of women's football as a participation sport in Madagascar.|$|E

50|$|As Australia moved {{north into}} the desert latitudes, <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> became hotter <b>and</b> drier, and the soils poorer and leached of nutrients, causing the old Antarctic flora to retreat to the humid corners of <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> in favor of new drought and fire {{tolerant}} flora, dominated by the Eucalyptus, Casuarina, and Acacia trees, and by grasses and scrub where the rainfall was too scarce to support trees.

5|$|About 298 {{million years}} ago Permian forests started to cover <b>the</b> <b>continent,</b> <b>and</b> there were tundras as late as 15 {{million years ago}}, but the climate of present-day Antarctica does not allow {{extensive}} vegetation to form. A combination of freezing temperatures, poor soil quality, lack of moisture, and lack of sunlight inhibit plant growth. As a result, the diversity of plant life is very low and limited in distribution. The flora of the continent largely consists of bryophytes. There are about 100 species of mosses and 25 species of liverworts, but only three species of flowering plants, {{all of which are}} found in the Antarctic Peninsula: Deschampsia antarctica (Antarctic hair grass), Colobanthus quitensis (Antarctic pearlwort) and the non-native Poa annua (annual bluegrass). Growth is restricted to a few weeks in the summer.|$|E
5|$|Although Portuguese by birth, Ferdinand Magellan {{transferred}} his {{allegiance to}} King Charles I of Spain, on whose behalf he left Seville on 10 August 1519, with {{a squadron of}} five ships, {{in search of a}} western route to the Spice Islands in the East Indies. Success depended on finding a strait or passage through the South American land masses, or finding the southern tip of <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> <b>and</b> sailing around it. The South American coast was sighted on 6 December 1519, and Magellan moved cautiously southward, following the coast to reach latitude 49°S on 31 March 1520. Little if anything was known of the coast south of this point, so Magellan decided to wait out the southern winter here, and established the settlement of Puerto San Julian.|$|E
5|$|English ornithologist John Latham {{described}} the boobook owl as Strix boobook in 1801, taking its species epithet {{from a local}} Aboriginal word for the bird. John Gould described Athene marmorata in 1846 from a specimen in South Australia; this is now regarded as a synonym. German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup classified the two taxa into subgenus Spiloglaux of a new genus Ieraglaux in 1852, renaming S. boobook to Ieraglaux (Spiloglaux) bubuk. In his 1865 Handbook to the Birds of Australia, Gould recognised three species, all of which he placed in the genus Spiloglaux: S. marmoratus from South Australia, S. boobook, which is widespread across <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> <b>and</b> Tasmania, and S. maculatus from southeastern Australia and Tasmania.|$|E

5|$|In 1294 the French king {{declared}} the English duchy of Aquitaine forfeit, and {{war broke out}} between the two countries. Edward I embarked on a wide-scale and costly project of building alliances with other princes on <b>the</b> <b>Continent,</b> <b>and</b> preparing an invasion. When the king, at the parliament of March 1297 in Salisbury, demanded military service from his earls, Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, refused in his capacity of marshal of England. The argument was that the king's subjects were not obliged to serve abroad if not {{in the company of}} the king, but Edward insisted on taking his army to Flanders while sending his earls to Gascony.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century Æthelwulf's {{reputation}} among historians was poor: he {{was seen}} as excessively pious and impractical, and his pilgrimage {{was viewed as a}} desertion of his duties.

5|$|It is {{difficult}} to discuss the MSA of Africa without first considering the immense size of the continent. There are archaeological sites and evidence from across <b>the</b> <b>continent,</b> <b>and,</b> {{for the sake of}} ease, it has often been divided into five regions: northern Africa, which is often, though not without controversy, taken into consideration more so with Southwest Asia and Europe than with the rest of Africa; eastern Africa, stretching roughly from the highlands of Ethiopia to the southern part of Kenya; central Africa, which is arguably the least explored region, stretching from the borders of Tanzania and Kenya to include Angola; southern Africa, which includes the numerous cave sites of South Africa; and western Africa.|$|E

5|$|It {{is one of}} 12 {{species of}} the genus Malurus, {{commonly}} known as fairywrens, found in Australia and lowland New Guinea. Within the genus it belongs {{to a group of}} four very similar species known collectively as chestnut-shouldered fairywrens.

5|$|Newman {{needed to}} find {{financial}} backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on <b>the</b> <b>continent,</b> <b>and</b> Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, from {{his experience as a}} singing teacher, agreed. As members of Wood's brass and woodwind sections were unwilling to buy new low-pitched instruments, Cathcart imported a set from Belgium and lent them to the players. After a season, the players recognised that the low pitch would be permanently adopted, and they bought the instruments from him.|$|E

5|$|Several governments {{maintain}} permanent manned research stations on the continent. The {{number of}} people conducting and supporting scientific research and other work on <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> <b>and</b> its nearby islands varies from about 1,000 in winter to about 5,000 in the summer, giving it a population density between 70 and 350 inhabitants per million square kilometres (180 and 900 per million square miles) at these times. Many of the stations are staffed year-round, the winter-over personnel typically arriving from their home countries for a one-year assignment. An Orthodox church—Trinity Church, opened in 2004 at the Russian Bellingshausen Station—is manned year-round by one or two priests, who are similarly rotated every year.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{along the}} lower Little Tennessee, lower Tellico, and lower Hiwassee rivers, the Overhill towns rose to {{prominence}} within the Cherokee Nation {{in the early}} 18th century, when they began to standardize trade with the British colonists.

By the middle of the century, the Overhill towns were consistently courted by both British and French emissaries, as the two powers struggled for the control of <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> <b>and</b> the lucrative fur trade.|$|E
5|$|Although Germanus's {{name is not}} Anglo-Saxon, Byrhtferth, a {{contemporary}} who wrote the Vita Oswaldi, which contains much information on Germanus, states {{that he was a}} native of Winchester. Germanus accompanied Oscytel, the Archbishop of York, and Oswald of Worcester, on their trip to Rome in about 957, purportedly to collect Oscytel's pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority. This journey, however, has been challenged by the historian Donald Bullough, who argues that no previous archbishops of York had collected their palliums in person. He also points out that this story is only related in the Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis, the chronicle of the Ramsey Abbey. According to the Ramsey story, Oscytel and Oswald returned to England, but Germanus remained on <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> <b>and</b> became a monk at Fleury Abbey in France. Another story has Oswald journeying to Fleury on his own, with Germanus arriving at Fleury after Oswald had been resident at Fleury {{for a number of years}} prior to 958.|$|E
