5|$|The end {{of silent}} {{film in the}} West and in Japan was imposed by the {{industry}} and the market, not by any inner need or natural evolution.... Silent cinema was a highly pleasurable and fully mature form. It didn't lack anything, least in Japan, where <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> human voice doing the dialogues and the commentary. Sound films were not better, just more economical. As a cinema owner you didn't {{have to pay the}} wages of musicians and benshi any more. And a good benshi was a star demanding star payment.|$|E
5|$|After {{students}} {{passed the}} often difficult, bureaucratic, and heavily demanding Imperial Exams, as they became officials, {{they did not}} always {{see eye to eye}} with others that had passed the same examination. Even though they were fully-fledged graduates ready for government service, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> factor of competition with other officials. Promotion to a higher post, higher salary, additional honors, and selection for choice assignment responsibilities were often uncertain, as young new officials often needed higher-ranking officials to recommend them for service. Once an official would rise to the upper echelons of central administration based in the capital, they would often compete with others over influence of the emperor's official adoption of state policies. Officials with different opinions on how to approach administrative affairs often sought out other officials for support, leading to pacts of rivaling officials lining up political allies at court to sway the emperor against the faction they disagreed with.|$|E
5|$|When {{a member}} of the family died there were varying degrees of prostration and display of piety amongst family members, each one {{behaving}} differently according to the custom of kinship association with the deceased. There was to be no flashy or colorful attire while in the period of mourning, and proper funerary rituals were observed such as cleansing and clothing the deceased to rid him or her of impurities. This was one of the necessary steps in the observance of the deceased as one of the worshipped ancestors, which in turn raised the prestige of the family. Funerals were often expensive. A geomancer had to be consulted on where to bury the dead, caterers were hired to furnish the funeral banquet, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> purchase of the coffin, which was burned along with paper images of horses, carriages, and servants in order for them to accompany the deceased into the next life. Due to the high cost of burial, most families opted for the cheaper practice of cremation. This was frowned upon by Confucian officials due to beliefs in the ancestral cult. They sought to ban the practice with prohibitions in 963 and 972; despite this, cremation amongst the poor and middle classes persisted. By the 12th century, the government came up with the solution of installing public cemeteries where a family's deceased could be buried on state owned property.|$|E

25|$|The two {{religions}} however never fused completely and, while overlapping {{here and}} there, kept their particular identity within a difficult, largely un-systematized and tense relationship. This relationship existed, rather than between two systems, between particular kami and particular buddhas. The two were always perceived as parallel but separate entities. Besides shinbutsu shūgō <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> {{other side of}} the coin of continued separation.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the {{cylinders}} {{had to be}} emplaced at the very front of the trench system so that the gas was released directly over no man's land. This meant that {{the cylinders}} had to be manhandled through communication trenches, often clogged and sodden, and stored at the front where <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> risk that cylinders would be prematurely breached during a bombardment. A leaking cylinder could issue a telltale wisp of gas that, if spotted, would be sure to attract shellfire.|$|E

25|$|Law {{enforcement}} in the Moro Province was difficult. Outlaws {{would go to}} ground at their home cottas, requiring an entire troop of police or soldiers to arrest them. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> danger of a full-fledged battle breaking out during such an arrest, and this led to many known outlaws going unpunished. In 1911, Pershing resolved to disarm the Moros. Army Chief of Staff Leonard Wood (former Moro Province governor) disagreed with this plan, stating that the move was ill-timed and that the Moros would hide their best arms, turning in only their worst. Pershing waited until roads into the interior had been completed, so that government troops could protect disarmed Moros from holdouts. He conferred with the Datus, who mostly agreed that disarmament {{would be a good}} idea – provided that everybody disarmed.|$|E
25|$|Arizona v. California {{was a set}} of 11 United States Supreme Court cases {{dealing with}} water rights. These cases took place between the years of 1931 and 2006. The initial {{question}} of this case was {{to determine how much}} water from the Colorado river Arizona was entitled to. Many western states became involved in the debate over the rights of the water from the Colorado River, and finally the United States government became involved stating that several federal establishments, including five American Indian reservations, had water rights as defined by Winters v. United States. This United States Supreme Court case helped to solve a problem found in the case Winters v. United States. While the United States Supreme Court case of Winters v. United States held that American Indian Reservations do have reserved water rights equal to the amount of water needed on the reservation to sufficiently irrigate all of the irrigable reservation acreage, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> question of how to decide what amount of water was needed to sufficiently irrigate on the American Indian reservations. Arizona v. California offers the solution of adjudication to help fix this problem.|$|E
500|$|Initially {{slated for}} a March 2, 2012 release, {{the film was}} pushed by Paramount Pictures to a ten-month delay for January 11, 2013. Co-producer Kevin Messick later said: [...] "We’d {{finished}} it but we were still discussing adding a coda scene, which {{we were able to}} shoot. And <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> consideration that Jeremy [...] had Avengers and Bourne coming out. So the studio made a wise strategic move in finding a good release date for us." [...] Wirkola said that [...] "the main reason is because they wanted to wait on Jeremy. He was cast before , Bourne and The Avengers. They wanted to wait until after those. I was, of course, disappointed then, but actually it helped because we came in under budget" [...] and so the delay enabled him to re-add and shoot an additional scene that is set in the desert and which was cut from his original screenplay. The first trailer for the film was released on September 5, 2012.|$|E

2500|$|The New York Times {{reported}} that several earlier tastings {{had occurred in}} the U.S., with American chardonnays judged ahead of their French rivals. One such tasting occurred in New York just {{six months before the}} Paris Tasting, but [...] "champions of the French wines argued that the tasters were Americans with possible bias toward American wines. What is more, they said, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> possibility that the Burgundies had been mistreated during the long trip from the (French) wineries." ...|$|E

2500|$|Propeller-driven vessels {{operated}} at {{a disadvantage}} on the Willamette. [...] Sidewheel steamers did better in shallow water, as was often encountered on the upper Willamette and its navigable tributaries. [...] Propellers had to be submerged to furnish power, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> potential in low water of striking obstruction on the river bottom, which happened to the Washington at least once, in September 1851, on the lower Willamette river.

2500|$|There {{were very}} few cases of maltreatment of the island women or their {{children}} during the war, as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> risk of being informed on; however, some were sent postcards saying [...] "you are number X on the list for a haircut". Local girls seen out with Germans after the curfew were arrested for breach of the curfew law. After liberation, attempts to abuse the girls were defused {{by the police and}} British soldiers. Some girls were helped to leave the islands as soon as possible. A number of German soldiers returned and married their island sweethearts.|$|E
2500|$|Johny Loftus of {{the website}} Allmusic graded the album with {{three and a}} half out of five stars. He said that the album [...] "reasserts Amy Lee's {{position}} at Evanescence's center. Throughout the band's rise, there was the drama... but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> singular force of Lee, whose powerful vocals, strident public persona, and striking fashion sense broke down the doors of the alternative metal boys club." [...] He finished his review by saying, [...] "Appropriately, Lee is the star of Anywhere but Home. Her voice has an impressively raw quality live, and her banter with the fawning Parisian crowd is always engaging." [...] Geoff Barton of the magazine Classic Rock graded Anywhere but Home with four out of five stars.|$|E

2500|$|In a bid {{to inject}} an American flavour to the album and bolster its {{commercial}} appeal, Warner Bros. invited singer-songwriter Andrew Gold {{to contribute to a}} revised North American version of the LP. Gold wound up co-writing and playing on three new tracks which appeared on the North American release of Ten Out of 10. [...] This ultimately led to an offer from Gouldman and Stewart to officially join 10cc; an offer Gold declined because of other commitments. Gouldman later admitted greater involvement by Gold might have lifted the band's early 1980s output from its mediocrity. [...] "We should either have tried to change direction, which we didn't, or got someone else in the band, which we almost did. The albums weren't really bad, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> integrity, and the production values, but in retrospect, I find them rather dour, rather lacklustre." ...|$|E

Searching for a way to pay for the children's educations, the Lynch family met with an army recruiter in the summer of 2000 when Lynch was seventeen and still attending high school. [...] "He did not lie to the kids," [...] her mother said, [...] "he said <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> possibility of war in the future." [...] "But at that time it was before September 11, and there was no terrorism," [...] Lynch recalls, [...] "so we were like, 'that would never happen to me.'" [...] On September 19, 2001, Lynch entered basic training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. [...] She later completed Advanced Individual Training for her Military Occupational Specialty as a unit supply specialist (MOS 92Y) in the Quartermaster Corps at Fort Lee, Virginia.|$|E
