40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to simulate water and nitrogen transfers under <b>two</b> <b>furrow</b> irrigation technologies (every furrow irrigation (EFI) and alternative furrow irrigation (AFI)) on Chromic Luvisol in Sofia region, Bulgaria. A bi-dimensional water and solutes transport modeling approach, HYDRUS- 2 D model [Simunek, J., Sejna, M., Van Genuchten, M. T., 1999. The HYDRUS- 1 D and HYDRUS- 2 D codes for estimating unsaturated soil hydraulic and solutes transport parameters. Agron Abstr. 357] is adopted in order to consider the technology of irrigation and fertilization. The model is calibrated in six steps using detailed data observed in two cropped lysimeters. The data consist of water and nitrogen (N) profiles below ridge and furrow bed, precipitation, drainage and water/N uptake by plant. Hydrological components of the soil are derived from laboratory: water retention data (step (i)) and adjusted to field conditions when EFI is approximated by one-dimensional (step (ii)). Then a two-dimensional water flow is adopted in model simulations for parameter calibration and verification, under EFI (step (iii)) and under AFI technology (step (iv)). This model calibration and validation is then used to calibrate the solute transport parameters, that is the aim of step (v) and step (vi). EFI and particularly AFI technologies points out the necessary 2 D model using for the N transfer simulation under specific fertilizer applications.

40|$|Some crops {{have shown}} not {{to adapt to}} the no-tillage system (NTS) as a {{consequence}} of the compaction of the superficial soil layer. In a certain way, the mechanism used in seeders to open furrows for the deposition of fertilizers can have great importance in facilitating root penetration. This study was carried out to evaluate the influence of two fertilizer distribution mechanisms and N fertilization in upland rice (Oryza sativa) under NTS. The experiment was carried out in the growing seasons 2001 / 2002 and 2002 / 2003, in Botucatu, state of São Paulo, Brazil. A completely randomized block design was applied, with subdivided plots and four replications. Main plots consisted of <b>two</b> <b>furrow</b> opening mechanisms (furrow opener and double disk). Subplots consisted of four side dressing N levels (0, 40, 80 and 120 kg ha- 1).

The success for upland rice establishment under the NTS in dry winter regions of Brazil is directly associated to the furrow opening mechanism of the seed-drill. The furrow opener mechanism resulted in deeper seed deposition, consequently decreasing seedling population, number of panicles per area and grain yield.

40|$|Currently used {{conventional}} tillage systems for small-scale vegetable {{production in the}} region of Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico require a considerable amount of hand labor, energy and materials for all activities. Seedbed preparation can require up to 60 % of the total production cost in some systems in Mexico. Further, soil is degraded and eroded due to the system. Conservation tillage may reduce costs and prevent soil degradation, but appropriate tools, such as, no-tillage seeders for small-scale farmers are not available. This papers reports on the design and construction of a prototype of a no-tillage seeder for small-scale conservation tillage using a 2 -wheeled tractor. Three main functions received particular attention: opening of the soil, placing seed and/or fertilizer and closing the slot. Because of its vapor conservation and good seedling emergence, tools to create T-shaped slots were chosen, with adapted depth control and closing and covering devices. A systematic design process was applied in order to reach the required decisions. Function diagrams were defined from where morphologic charts guided the selection of the configuration of the seeder. A preliminary evaluation included testing of <b>two</b> <b>furrow</b> opener disc types (notched and fluted), and four crop residue levels, 0, 30, 60 and 100 %, with respect to performance of the seeder.

The notched disc had a better performance than the fluted disc. The inverted T-shape in the soil was not always sustained due to technical flaws.

This research was carried out in a corn (Zea mays L.) field aiming to evaluate the operational and energetic performance of a no-tillage seeder in two soil types with different vegetable covering and with different forward speeds, furrow opener and cut elements. The performance were evaluated through parameters of seeds longitudinal uniformity distribution, seeding depth, soil mobilized area, tractor and seeder tractive wheel slips, draw bar pull and power requirements, fuel consumption, plantules emergency, culture growing and productivity. The experiments were carried out in two different farms.

The pods were harvested at various ripening stages. As plant population increases pod yield increases too. Plant population between 25 and 50 plants per m" 2 is recommended. Pod quality is not to much affected by plant population. Irrigation rate is more important than quantity. Small and frequent amounts of water applied at flowering and pod formation are preferable. The pods of water unstressed plants have lower sieve size, less developed seeds and less fiberness. Green beans plants have water stress adaptation mechanisms, once in a stressed situation, plant recovers rapidly its turgidity, when more water is available. the growing cycle duration should be about 60 days (after sowing). as the growing cycle is enlarged, pod yield increases, but pod quality decreases, so the exact harvest date should be determined with accuracy and based on pod maturity.
