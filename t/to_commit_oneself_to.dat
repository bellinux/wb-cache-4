30|$|The model {{presented}} in this paper predicts that when individuals have either self-control problems or knowledge constraints, they make decisions that lead them to behave {{in a way that is}} not in their own best interest or that are unwise even according to their own preferences. People with self-control problems impose negative externalities on their future. Those within-person externalities have been called “internalities” (Whitman 2006). The harm resulting from an internality might be avoided in more than one way. Unfortunately, the private market only imperfectly provides such self-control mechanisms (Gruber 2002). It is very difficult <b>to</b> truly <b>commit</b> <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> not overeat or to maintain an exercise routine, for example. This suggests a potential role for cost-effective policies. However, these policies should not prevent people from behaving in their own best interests. Ideally, these policies should create benefits for those who do not make reliable decisions in their best interest while be harmless to those that make reliable decisions.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, I propose {{and defend}} a theory {{according}} <b>to</b> which <b>committing</b> <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> knowing the proposition expressed counts as an assertion of that proposition. A {{consequence of this}} view is the knowledge account of assertion, according to which one asserts that p correctly only if one knows that p. In support of this approach, I offer a strategy of identifying an assertion’s “normative consequences”, types of act that normally take place {{as a result of}} one’s making an assertion incorrectly. I outline two such phenomena: retraction and disavowal of knowledge. In continuation, I put the theory to test and critically examine four sets of objections against it, arguing that it can convincingly defuse them. Finally, I discuss two related issues: I maintain that by performing “aesthetic assertions” one also normally performs a non-assertoric speech act of recommendation, and argue for the possibility of “non-linguistic assertions”, whose content is expressed by gestures in appropriate contexts...|$|R

30|$|Dai and Diamond {{observed}} in the 1990 s that, compared to American culture, which regarded limited responsibility from children to parents as the norm, Chinese culture encouraged unlimited responsibility and devotion to parents or family (1998). However, how parents and children perceive and discharge “unlimited responsibility” is clearly changing in the twenty-first century. An increase in investing in the younger generation {{and a decrease in}} the taken-for-grantedness of care-in-return of the older generation has been consistent across Asian societies (Lee 2010; Göransson 2009; Croll 2006; Park et al. 2005). In the context of the middle-class one-child transnational family, children had very limited material responsibilities towards parents, and future care expectations were unclear. For now, it is the willingness <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> caring for parents’ well-being, not necessarily the observable filial actions, that has been regarded by both generations as the priority of being filial.|$|E
40|$|In {{philosophical}} discourse, one way {{of considering}} {{the question of why}} we should be moral has been through hypothetical scenarios in which being moral becomes an option, rather than simply a given. Most of the time, shaped as we are by our upbringing and culture, we do the right thing without giving it much thought. But when faced with a situation where we can do anything, no matter how wicked, without fear of punishment, or where doing the wrong thing seems more rewarding than doing the right thing, the question of why we should be moral naturally arises. Film, in a position to pose hypothetical scenarios of this sort, offers an opportunity for exploring such considerations. In addition, by posing these hypothetical scenarios in the form of concrete, emotionally engaging narratives, film can capture something else as well, the question’s “existential” aspect. Whether to be moral is not simply an abstract theoretical question, but a deeply practical concern, of how one is to live, whether <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> a particular way of life...|$|E
40|$|The {{so called}} “elenctic” {{defense of the}} {{principle}} of non-contradiction in Metaphysics Γ 4 will succed if only the opponent will say something. The strategy consists in showing that, in speaking, the opponent has al- ready accepted the principle. Given the structure of the argument, the only way to avoid begging the question is not to ask from the opponent any commitment exceeding the conditions of mere meanigfullness of speech. In particular, it is specially important to avoid any reliance on Aristotelian essentialism. A reading which is in accordance with these requirements will hold that the core of the proof consists in showing that meaning something amounts to singling out a meaning. The mere aim of telling what is within from what is without the bounds imposed on speech of any complexity is enough to show that the speaker accepts the principle of non-contradiction. One is thereby not required <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> any particular description of reality.

40|$|An {{influential}} tradition – {{which in}} contemporary thinking has {{its origins in}} the reflections of John Ellis McTaggart, later followed by many authors in contemporary analytical philosophy – has it that time and change do not exist. According to this same tradition, the idea of personal identity would be inconsistent, and each individual {{should be regarded as}} a mere relationship: personal identity would be nothing but the whole of the experiences of each individual, properly related. Against this line of thinking, it can be argued the following: 1) time is a secondary notion with respect to the notions of event, sequence and physical process; 2) change is an ontologically primitive given; to say that a system is changing is nothing but to say that distinctive quantities of that system show ordered and numerically distinct values; 3) among these physical quantities (and the values they assume) a selection may be done, apt to identify those particular systems that we call "persons"; 4) to say that a certain person is changed, means <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> state the specific features which allow to identify that person, and to show the values which those features have assumed in the same order in which they were recorded...|$|E
40|$|Der Autor vertritt die These, daß der Zwang zur monosexuellen Festlegung in den letzten 200 Jahren ständig zugenommen hat und - scheinbar paradoxerweise - in den letzten 25 Jahren durch den Prozeß der sexuellen Liberalisierung noch einmal akzentuiert wurde. Affirmiert wurde diese Entwicklung durch essentialistische Theorien über Homo- und Heterosexualität. Das Aufkommen konstruktivistischer Ansätze ist zugleich Symptom und Movens einer beginnenden Auflösung monosexueller Festlegung. Als Utopie hält der Autor eine von der Geschlechtsfixierung befreite Sexualität für denkbar; diese ist keinesfalls mit dem traditionellen Begriff 'bisexuell' zu fassen, da Bisexualität nur so lange existiert, solange in den überkommenden Kategorien 'Homo-' und 'Heterosexualität' gedacht wird.

40|$|International audienceThis book {{addresses}} {{some of the}} {{key questions}} that scientists have been asking themselves for centuries: what is knowledge? What is information? How do we know that we know something? How do we construct meaning from the perceptions of things? And how do we communicate this meaning to others [...] that is to say, inform them? Although no consensus exists on a common definition of the concepts of information and communication, few can reject the hypothesis that information - whether perceived as an " object " or as a " process " - is a precondition for knowledge. Epistemology can be defined as the study of how we know things in general [...] this is its primary signification in the anglophone world [...] or, more specifically, as the study of how scientific knowledge is attained and validated [...] this is how it is conceived in the francophone world. To adopt an epistemological stance is <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> render an account of what constitutes knowledge or, in procedural terms, to render an account of when one can claim to know something. An epistemological theory imposes constraints on the interpretation of human cognitive interaction with the world.
