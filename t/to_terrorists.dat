5|$|Reaction to {{the utility}} by Doom9 forum members, bloggers, and {{mainstream}} media has ranged from supportive to intensely hostile. By some, the circumvention of AACS {{was seen as}} a reaffirmation of fair use. Others felt that the utility {{was no more than a}} piracy tool and would bring about group punishment against consumers in the form of player revocation. One article compared proponents of BackupHDDVD <b>to</b> <b>terrorists.</b> When the release of the tool was first publicized, several articles claimed that AACS had been cracked. In fact no cryptographic weaknesses constituting a crack have yet been found in AES, the underlying cryptographic system of AACS. Keys are actually obtained through a side-channel attack.|$|E

She was convicted on charges of conspiracy and providing material support <b>to</b> <b>terrorists</b> in 2005, and sentenced to 28 months in prison. Her felony conviction led to her being automatically disbarred.

25|$|Al Jazeera {{came to the}} {{attention}} of many in the West during the hunt for Osama bin Laden and the Taliban in Afghanistan after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States. It aired videos it received from Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, deeming new footage of the world's most wanted fugitives to be newsworthy. Some criticized the network for giving a voice <b>to</b> <b>terrorists.</b> Al Jazeera's Washington, D.C., bureau chief, Hafez al-Mirazi, compared the situation to that of the Unabomber's messages in The New York Times. The network said it had been given the tapes because it had a large Arab audience.|$|E
25|$|When Japan {{asserted}} that nuclear weapons {{must be removed}} after reversion, they were withdrawn from sites in Okinawa during the early 1970s. Kristensen writes that criticisms following a 1969 Far East visit by a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee prompted the JCS in 1974 to order {{a study of the}} forward-deployed tactical nuclear weapons at East Asian bases. The study found the number of sites could be reduced because they had had more weapons than required, as well as that response teams at sites with nuclear weapons were unprepared for a coordinated attack and might be vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>terrorists.</b> Following the JCS order, the Department of Defense began withdrawing U.S. tactical nuclear weapons from Taiwan in 1974, and from the Philippines in 1976. Kristensen writes that the DOD withdrawal of forward-deployed weapons was 'not simply' due to the sovereignty-return negotiations.|$|E

25|$|Fred Tupper (Neil Crone)– The local loudmouth and {{the host}} of a talk show on the local radio station, he often equates Muslims <b>to</b> <b>terrorists</b> who want to take over the country. However, at times he finds himself in the awkward {{position}} of siding with the Muslim community, as evidenced in the first season. A flashback episode revealed that his distrust of Muslims stems more from an unpleasant encounter with Baber than from any deeply held prejudices. His radio rants are primarily a ratings-grabbing persona; while he can be a blowhard jerk on and off the air, he treats pretty much everyone with equal condescension (not just Muslims). By season 3, it is revealed that his objectionable comments {{have more to do with}} habit and keeping ratings up, than any active dislike of Muslims. In fact, when he believes he is dying, he is downright friendly to everyone (including Muslims) and almost declares his love to Fatima. She graciously allows him his dignity when he claims it is in fact her hummus that he loves. Fred Tupper is also a divorcee.|$|E
25|$|Sami Al-Arian's {{brother-in-law}} Mazen Al-Najjar {{was jailed}} {{for nearly five}} years, accused of having links to Palestinian terrorists. In May 1997, Al-Najjar was incarcerated in Miami, Florida without charge and was held in jail indefinitely {{on the basis of}} secret evidence. Although Judge McHugh found Al-Najjar to be a respected member of a community, McHugh denied bail on the basis of secret evidence in May 1997. In May 2000, U.S. district judge John A. Leonard ordered a rehearing because Al-Najjar's right to due process had been violated when the government did not cede evidence in order for Al-Najjar to defend himself. During {{the first day of the}} rehearing in August 2000, the government called Al-Arian to testify. Several legal analysts and Al-Arian were convinced that Al-Arian, not Al-Najjar, was the focus of the Al-Najjar's court case. On the advice of his attorney, Al-Arian cited the 5th Amendment to 99 of 102 questions. Because Al-Najjar was a Palestinian born in Gaza during Egyptian control of the region, Al-Najjar essentially had no citizenship anywhere and the allegations that he was connected <b>to</b> <b>terrorists</b> had ruined attempts to find a country to take him, his wife, and three young daughters. Al-Najjar was released in December 2000 after a judge ruled the government had no evidence to continue holding him. He overstayed his US student visa, and was deported in August 2002.|$|E

Further, the multiple regression analysis shows that the stock market reaction is more negative for tourism industry than other industries while foreign ownership does not influence the stock market reaction. Thus, this study corroborates previous studies showing that terrorist attack is deemed as bad news in capital market and consequently will negatively affect the investment decision (Chen dan Siem 2004) ...|$|R
