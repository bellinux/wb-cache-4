50|$|The AT&T Madison Complex <b>Tandem</b> <b>Office</b> is a 17-story, 79 m {{skyscraper}} in Los Angeles, California, {{completed in}} 1961. With its microwave tower, used through 1993, bringing the overall height to 137 m, {{it is the}} 29th tallest building in Los Angeles. The building serves 1.3 million phone lines in area code 213, and other Los Angeles area codes, for foreign long distance calling.|$|E
50|$|In {{modern times}} only the terms Class 4 and Class 5 are much used, as any <b>tandem</b> <b>office</b> is {{referred}} to as a Class 4. This change was prompted in great part by changes in the power of switches and the relative cost of transmission, both of which tended to flatten the switch hierarchy. The breakup of the Bell System, and the need for each of the surviving regional operating companies to handle long distance interconnections, also promoted the inclusion of inter-regional and international processing through larger Class 4 offices.|$|E
5000|$|In special cases, calls {{through a}} <b>tandem</b> <b>office</b> also used PCI signaling. This {{originated}} with manual operator tandems, {{and was later}} carried on to machine-based tandems as well. For this special tandem class, all seven dialed digits {{were sent to the}} distant office. In the case of a manual tandem, operators had a special seven segment display which displayed the entire telephone number. In later mechanical tandems, PCI was used because it was a faster than revertive pulse signaling, and would thus allow for quicker call completion times.|$|E
5000|$|In the Bell System, central offices {{provided}} {{this type}} of service on a dedicated telephone number (102 type Milliwatt line) for remote subscriber line testing. In conjunction, a second line (type 100 line) provided quiet termination (cf. loop around). Various types of test lines were called [...] "100", [...] "102", [...] "104" [...] etc. because these numbers accessed the test line in <b>tandem</b> <b>offices</b> in lieu of an area code.|$|R

50|$|Like Tandem's prior {{high end}} machines, Cyclone {{cabinets}} were styled {{with lots of}} angular black to suggest strength and power. Advertising videos directly compared Cyclone to the SR-71 Blackbird Mach 3 spy plane. Cyclone's name was supposed to represent its unstoppable speed in roaring through OLTP workloads. Announcement day was October 17 and the press came to town. That afternoon, the region {{was struck by the}} magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake, causing freeway collapses in Oakland and major fires in San Francisco. <b>Tandem</b> <b>offices</b> were shaken, but no one was badly hurt on site. This was the first and last time that Tandem named its products after a natural disaster.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{originally}} established as {{an affiliate of}} Nippon News Network (NNN) and Nippon Television Network System (NNS) in Yahata (Yahata Higashi-ku, Kitakyūshū) in August 1958, then a station in Fukuoka was established in February 1962. They changed affiliation from NNN and NNS to FNN and FNS in October 1964. The head office was moved to Fukuoka, and the call sign changed from [...] "JOHX-TV" [...] (still the call sign of Kitakyūshū <b>Tandem</b> <b>office</b> for analog broadcast) to [...] "JOJY-TV" [...] in December 1974. They relocated their office to its current location near Fukuoka Tower in August 1996.|$|E
50|$|Location is an {{important}} concept {{in the manner of}} how the Enhanced 9-1-1 system works. Location determination depends upon the Automatic Location Information (ALI) database which is maintained on behalf of local governments by contracted private third parties generally the Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC). Often, the contracted 3rd party further subcontracts the actual ALI database management to companies such as Intrado, Bandwidth and TeleCommunication Systems, Inc. The ALI database also feeds the Master Street Address Guide database which is used to route the call to the appropriate PSAP and when the call arrives, the ALI database is queried to determine the location of the caller.The 9-1-1 call arrives at the appropriate PSAP after it is routed across the Public switched telephone network (PSTN) to a special, often dedicated facility, called a Class 4 telephone switch or <b>Tandem</b> <b>Office.</b> The <b>Tandem</b> <b>Office</b> uses a technology referred to as Selective Routing to query the SRDB (Selective Routing Database) and MSAG (Master Street Address Guide) using the originating telephone number as a search key to match the origination of the call to the network location or Emergency Service Number (ESN) of the appropriate PSAP. When the call is delivered to the PSAP, a second query is made to the Automatic Location Information (ALI), again using the originating telephone number as a search key. The ALI record associated with the query is then returned to the PSAP where the Customer-premises equipment (CPE) correlates that information with the call taker receiving the call and displays the information on their computer screen.|$|E
50|$|The class 4 {{office is}} the Toll Center (TC), Toll Point (TP), or Intermediate Point (IP). A call going between two end offices not {{directly}} connected, or whose direct trunks are busy, is routed through the toll center. The toll center {{is also used}} to connect to the long-distance network for calls where added costs are incurred, such as operator handled services. This toll center may also be called the <b>tandem</b> <b>office</b> because calls have to pass through this location to get {{to another part of the}} network. Toll centers might have been operated either as interstate facilities, under the operation of AT&T Long Lines (GTE in a few cases), or by local telephone companies, handling long distance traffic to points within a particular operating company territory. Class 4 offices continue to exist, although with considerable changes, as they handle local exchange company interconnections, locally charged or long distance rated, or provide facilities for connection to long distance company points of presence.|$|E

50|$|In Bell System {{telephone}} exchanges, {{particularly the}} 5XB switches, {{information from the}} marker told the sender that the call required ANI, and stored the calling equipment number in reed relay packs in the sender. The sender used the transverter connector (TVC) to seize a transverter (TV), which was a bay {{of a few hundred}} flat spring relays that controlled all AMA functions. The TV looked in the AMA translator (AMAT) that took care of these particular few thousand lines. AMAT was a rack of ferrite ring cores with cross-connect wires passing through holes of 3 × 4 inches or about a decimeter square, one wire per line. The wire was terminated on a wire wrap peg representing that particular line, and passed through a ring that represented the NNX digits of the billing number, then the M, C, D and finally Units of that number. When queried, AMAT sent a high-current pulse through the wire for that particular line, inducing pulses in the appropriate rings which were amplified by a cold cathode tube amplifier and then by a relay, and sent back to the transverter which supplied it to the sender for transmission by ANI to the <b>tandem</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E

50|$|Other {{holders of}} the rank are {{difficult}} to identify from the literary sources, since the office of spāhbed was held in <b>tandem</b> with other <b>offices</b> and titles, such as Shahrwarāz ("Boar of the Empire"), which are often treated as personal names. A further factor of confusion in later literary sources is the interchangeable use of the rank with the junior provincial ranks of marzbān ("frontier-warden, margrave") and pāygōsbān ("district guardian").|$|R
25|$|The Vice President {{is elected}} {{in the same}} manner as, but {{separately}} from, the President. Both the President and the Vice President are elected by direct plurality vote where the candidate who garners the highest number of votes, whether a majority or not, wins the election. While candidates usually run in <b>tandem</b> for the <b>offices</b> of President and Vice President, under their own political parties, it is possible and not unusual for candidates from different parties to be elected as President and Vice President.|$|R
5000|$|During Summer 2008, {{three years}} of effort by the Technology Committee, in <b>tandem</b> with the <b>Office</b> of Instructional Technology and support from the administration, led to the {{installation}} of ceiling-mounted DLP video projectors for use in classroom teaching in almost every instructional space, with the remainder placed in the following school years as budget allowed. [...] "Smartboards" [...] are also scattered throughout the building, but both of these pieces of technology {{have a reputation for}} not working. One student estimates that in her school day, at least an hour of instructional time is used in total each day trying to work around the malfunctioning technology. Many teachers almost feel burdened by the addition of the rarely working Smartboads, and refuse to use them, leading one {{to the conclusion that the}} purchaseof the expensive boards was superfluous and unnecessary compared to some of the other essentials the school lacks.|$|R
