50|$|Acme threads have a 29° thread angle, {{which is}} easier to machine than square threads. They are not as {{efficient}} as square threads, due to the increased friction induced by the thread angle. ACME Threads are generally also stronger than square threads due to their trapezoidal <b>thread</b> <b>profile,</b> which provides greater load-bearing capabilities.|$|E
50|$|The major {{diameter}} of threads is {{the larger of}} two extreme diameters delimiting {{the height of the}} <b>thread</b> <b>profile,</b> as a cross-sectional view is taken in a plane containing the axis of the threads. For a screw, this is its outside diameter (OD). The {{major diameter}} of a nut may not be directly measured, but it may be tested with go/no-go gauges.|$|E
50|$|The {{buttress}} thread form, {{also known as}} the breech-lock thread form, refers to two different <b>thread</b> <b>profiles.</b> One is a type of leadscrew and the other is a type of hydraulic sealing thread form. The leadscrew type is often used in machinery and the sealing type is often used in oil fields.|$|R
30|$|In this investigation, the defect-free joints were {{achieved}} while using THC and TTC pin profiled tools in both {{air and water}} cooling medium. During each rotation of the tool, the <b>threaded</b> <b>profile</b> extrudes cylindrical sheets of material around the tool pin from AS to RS and from RS to AS. The peaks and valleys of <b>threaded</b> pin <b>profile</b> offer more friction over the plasticized material which promotes sticking condition. Thus, the extent of heat generation and plasticization is sufficient to attain the balance state of heat and material flow. In general, the defect is formed in the weld periphery, i.e. the transformed layers around the tool pin. So, the pin profile should capable of forming sufficient transforming layers. By creating enough transforming layers by plasticization and shearing of materials, the <b>threaded</b> pin <b>profiles</b> (THC and TTC) are capable of resulting sound joints.|$|R

5000|$|The {{ball screw}} {{is a more}} {{advanced}} type of leadscrew that uses a recirculating-ball nut to minimize friction and prolong {{the life of the}} screw threads. The <b>thread</b> <b>profile</b> of such screws is approximately semicircular (commonly a [...] "gothic arch" [...] profile) to properly mate with the bearing balls. The disadvantage to this type of screw {{is that it is not}} self-locking. Ball screws are prevalent in powered leadscrew actuators.|$|E
5000|$|To obtain proper rolling {{action of}} the balls, as in a {{standard}} ball bearing, it is necessary that, when loaded in one direction, the ball makes contact at one point with the nut, and one point with the screw. In practice, most ball screws {{are designed to be}} lightly preloaded, so that there is at least a slight load on the ball at four points, two in contact with the nut and two in contact with the screw. This is accomplished by using a <b>thread</b> <b>profile</b> that has a slightly larger radius than the ball, the difference in radii being kept small (e.g. a simple V thread with flat faces is unsuitable) so that elastic deformation around the point of contact allows a small, but non-zero contact area to be obtained, like any other rolling element bearing. To this end, the threads are usually machined as a [...] "gothic arch" [...] profile. If a simple semicircular <b>thread</b> <b>profile</b> were used, contact would only be at two points, on the outer and inner edges, which would not resist axial loading.|$|E
50|$|Nominal Pipe Size (NPS) is loosely {{related to}} the inside {{diameter}} of Schedule 40 pipe. Because of the pipe wall thickness, the actual diameter of the threads {{is larger than the}} NPS, considerably so for small NPS. Pipe of other schedules with a certain NPS has different wall thickness, but the same outside diameter and <b>thread</b> <b>profile</b> as Schedule 40, so the inside diameter of the pipe is therefore different from the NPS.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The protein <b>threading</b> {{problem with}} <b>profiles</b> {{is known to}} be {{efficiently}} solvable using dynamic programming. In this paper, we consider a variant of the protein <b>threading</b> problem with <b>profiles</b> in which constraints on distances between residues are given. We prove that protein <b>threading</b> with <b>profiles</b> and constraints is NP-hard. Moreover, we show a strong hardness result on the approximation of an optimal threading satisfying all the constraints. On the other hand, we develop two practical algorithms: CLIQUETHREAD and BBDPTHREAD. CLIQUETHREAD reduces the threading problem to the maximum edgeweight clique problem, whereas BBDPTHREAD combines dynamic programming and branch-and-bound techniques. We perform computational experiments using protein structure data in PDB (Protein Data Bank) using simulated distance constraints. The results show that constraints are useful to improve the alignment accuracy of the target sequence and the template structure. Moreover, these results also show that BBDPTHREAD is in general faster than CLIQUETHREAD for larger size proteins whereas CLIQUETHREAD is useful if there does not exist a feasible threading. key words: maximum edge weight clique, dynamic programming, protein <b>threading,</b> <b>profiles,</b> distance constraints 1...|$|R
2500|$|Trapezoidal thread {{forms are}} screw <b>thread</b> <b>profiles</b> with {{trapezoidal}} outlines. They {{are the most}} common forms used for leadscrews (power screws). They offer high strength and ease of manufacture. They are typically found where large loads are required, as in a vise or the leadscrew of a lathe. Standardized variations include multiple-start threads, left-hand threads, and self-centering threads (which are less likely to bind under lateral forces).|$|R
50|$|VTune Amplifier {{assists in}} {{various kinds of}} code {{profiling}} including stack sampling, <b>thread</b> <b>profiling</b> and hardware event sampling. The profiler result consists of details such as time spent in each sub routine which can be drilled down to the instruction level. The time taken by the instructions are indicative of any stalls in the pipeline during instruction execution. The tool can be also used to analyze thread and storage performance.|$|R
50|$|In an {{external}} (male) thread (e.g., on a bolt), the major diameter Dmaj and the minor diameter Dmin define maximum {{dimensions of the}} thread. This means that the external thread must end flat at Dmaj, but can be rounded out below the minor diameter Dmin. Conversely, in an internal (female) thread (e.g., in a nut), the major and minor diameters are minimum dimensions, therefore the <b>thread</b> <b>profile</b> must end flat at Dmin but may be rounded out beyond Dmaj.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, {{the first}} {{historically}} important intra-company standardization of screw threads began with Henry Maudslay around 1800, when the modern screw-cutting lathe made interchangeable V-thread machine screws a practical commodity. During the next 40 years, standardization continued to {{occur on the}} intra- and inter-company levels. No doubt many mechanics of the era participated in this zeitgeist; Joseph Clement {{was one of those}} whom history has noted. In 1841, Joseph Whitworth created a design that, through its adoption by many British railroad companies, became a national standard for the United Kingdom called British Standard Whitworth. During the 1840s through 1860s, this standard was often used in the United States and Canada as well, in addition to myriad intra- and inter-company standards. In April 1864, William Sellers presented a paper to the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, proposing a new standard to replace the US' poorly standardized screw thread practice. Sellers simplified the Whitworth design by adopting a <b>thread</b> <b>profile</b> of 60° and a flattened tip (in contrast to Whitworth's 55° angle and rounded tip). The 60° angle was already in common use in America, but Sellers's system promised to make it and all other details of threadform consistent.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThread milling {{has become}} quite popular {{in recent years}} as an {{alternative}} to tapping or other forms of threading because of diversity and complexity of parts and flexibility of the process in industries such as biomedical applications, aerospace and die-mold manufacturing. Today the design of the tooth profile is, however, predominantly feasible by the expertise and “trial and error” principle. Presented in this paper are a novel methodology to design the tooth profile of the thread mill by comparing the “to-be” <b>thread</b> <b>profile</b> and the “as-is” <b>thread</b> <b>profile</b> which is analyzed by means of NC cutting simulation. The simulation kernel enables to continually subtract the swept volume of thread milling cutter undergoing helical movement from the workpiece and to calculate the virtual workpiece (VWP).

40|$|Protein <b>threading</b> with <b>profiles</b> {{in which}} {{constraints}} on distances between residues are given {{is known to}} be NP-hard. Moreover, a simple algorithm known as CLIQUETHREAD based on efficient reduction to maximum edge-weight clique finding problem has been known to be a practical algorithm for solving the protein <b>threading</b> problem with <b>profiles</b> and constraints.

The comparison of FTHREAD with existing state-of-the-art methods shows that although our algorithm uses a simple threading function, our algorithm performs equally well as these existing methods for protein threading.

40|$|In {{order to}} meet the demand of high {{position}} accuracy, many methods have been developed for measuring the <b>thread</b> <b>profile</b> features of ball screws.

40|$|International audienceThread milling is {{becoming}} more and more employed as a technique for producing thread, due to its advantages for industrial manufacturing sectors, such as the aeronautics, aerospace, and energy industries. The thread milling operation is atypical and several aspects have to be taken into account to perform it in good conditions. As for milling or grinding worms, grooves, thread or others sculptured surfaces, in thread milling, there exists a geometrical interference between the tool and the nominal surface which would be obtained. Thread mills have quite complex geometry and their profile has an effect on the machined thread. The present study details geometrical aspects of the thread milling process. This article deals with the link between thread mill geometry and nominal <b>thread</b> <b>profile.</b> An approach is proposed to analyze the <b>thread</b> <b>profile</b> generated by the thread mill envelope.

40|$|The {{thread cutting}} process of {{threaded}} joint between metal screw and short glass fibre reinforced polymer part (PAGF 30) was modelled by the Finite Element Method {{in order to}} establish the right joint geometry. An axial symmetrical model was developed for modelling the mounting process. The model takes into consideration the non-linear constitutive law of polymer, its large deformations and in-plane friction. In the contact process the metal screw was assumed to be rigid. As a result of simulation, the <b>thread</b> <b>profile</b> in the nut and surface pressures over the contact area were specified, which can serve as a basis for taking thermal load and tangential friction into consideration. In addition, the pre-tightening process and limit force of damage were determined. The resulting <b>thread</b> <b>profile</b> and limit force are in good correlation with the experimental data. The deviation can be explained with the material softening due to the higher temperature. The thermal process due to the frictional heat generation was separately analyzed.

40|$|Roller screws (RS) {{featuring}} {{very high}} operational parameters {{are the most}} promising transformers of rotational motion into translational motion. The original gear design {{with a number of}} peculiarities and precision accuracy in manufacturing its essential details, first of all, thread ones allow us to have high operating parameters of RS. Errors of manufacturing special thread of such details greatly affect the load carrying capacity, precision, reliability, and endurance of RS. That is why the challenge is highly accurate metrological control of errors, which have the greatest influence on specified parameters, and processing of measurement results. Major errors include deviations of real pitch of thread from nominal ones and deviations of real thread profiles from nominal ones. The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine abovementioned errors, which were measured by high-precision computerized devices, namely: MITUTOYO CV- 2000 contour measurement instrument; Form Talysurf PGI 420 contour measurement instrument. Both have a measurement range of 100 mm and resolution of 0. 2 μm. As far as a rental cost of the contour measurement instrument was rather high and a software of this device did not allow us to obtain all required information on the <b>thread</b> <b>profile</b> errors of interest, a <b>thread</b> <b>profile</b> was measured using a contour measuring device on the sampling length. Measurement results were copied to the USB flash drive, and then conversion of obtained results and calculation of all errors of interest were carried out on ECM by means of specially designed software.
