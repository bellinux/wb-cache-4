[...] When asked if they are pro gamers, Bajo and Hex explained that in truth they aren't, as [...] "a pro gamer is someone who plays games professionally at the highest competitive levels in tournaments... so we don't really fit that description, and pro gamers around the world would scoff if we ever said we were [...] "pro"."

[...] They said they review bad games along with good games as they can't know what quality the game will be until they've actually played it, and also if all the reviewed games were given highly positive reviews, they reviews would be redundant and their rating system meaningless. Also, as games are expensive, the team want to warn viewers about what games they should avoid. They have also stated they make an effort to review games on all consoles.|$|E

5000|$|Lee {{invented the}} Hyper-View Large Format Stereo Print Viewer in 1990, {{improving}} on a viewer previously used for reviewing stereo medical X-rays and aerial stereo viewers. Both aerial stereo viewers and X-ray stereo viewers {{are similar in}} concept. The difference between the Hyper-View Large Format Stereo Viewer {{and the other two}} mentioned is that the others cannot cover a very large field of view. The Hyper-View device essentially widens the effective separation of the viewer's eyes from about 2½ inches to about 11 inches, as through two horizontal periscopes. One of the most convenient models is called the 3D Scope. Other viewers, include the Wheatstone Mini-Scope and the Adjustable 3D Prism Glasses. After building several viewers, Lee subsequently provided design specifications to Steven Berezin, of Berezin Stereo Products, a manufacturer which produces the oversized hyperviewers for sale to galleries and individual customers. Berezin has a viewer selection chart <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> which viewer is right for you. One of the main uses for which Lee envisioned was for gallery exhibitions of his own stereo prints. Lee was also interested in encouraging other [...] "fine art" [...] photographers who had never seriously considered stereo photography to begin producing creative work in this medium.|$|E

40|$|Unconventional therapies (UTs) are therapies {{not usually}} {{provided}} by Canadian physicians or other conventionally trained health care providers. Examples of common UTs available in Canada are herbal preparations, reflexology, acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine. UTs {{may be used}} along with conventional therapies (complementary) or instead of conventional therapies (alternative).

Your doctor may be unable to give you specific advice or recommendations, since UTs are often not in a physician's area of expertise.
