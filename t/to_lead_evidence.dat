5000|$|The use of {{the phrase}} was {{reviewed}} by the UK Supreme Court in Healthcare at Home Limited v. The Common Services Agency, where Lord Reed said: 1. The Clapham omnibus has many passengers. The most venerable is the reasonable man, who was born {{during the reign of}} Victoria but remains in vigorous health. Amongst the other passengers are the right-thinking member of society, familiar from the law of defamation, the officious bystander, the reasonable parent, the reasonable landlord, and the fair-minded and informed observer, all of whom have had season tickets for many years.2. The horse-drawn bus between Knightsbridge and Clapham, which Lord Bowen is thought to have had in mind, was real enough. But its most famous passenger, and the others I have mentioned, are legal fictions. They belong to an intellectual tradition of defining a legal standard by reference to a hypothetical person, which stretches back to the creation by Roman jurists of the figure of the bonus paterfamilias...3. It follows from the nature of the reasonable man, as a means of describing a standard applied by the court, that it would be misconceived for a party to seek <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>evidence</b> from actual passengers on the Clapham omnibus as to how they would have acted in a given situation or what they would have foreseen, in order to establish how the reasonable man would have acted or what he would have foreseen. Even if the party offered to prove that his witnesses were reasonable men, the evidence would be beside the point. The behaviour of the reasonable man is not established by the evidence of witnesses, but by the application of a legal standard by the court. The court may require to be informed by evidence of circumstances which bear on its application of the standard of the reasonable man in any particular case; but it is then for the court to determine the outcome, in those circumstances, of applying that impersonal standard.4. In recent times, some additional passengers from the European Union have boarded the Clapham omnibus. This appeal is concerned with one of them: the reasonably well-informed and normally diligent tenderer.|$|E

5000|$|Therefore, {{under this}} rule if a witness gives {{testimony}} that {{is inconsistent with}} what the opposing party wants <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> as <b>evidence,</b> the opposing party must raise the contention with that witness during cross-examination.

40|$|This article {{outlines}} {{a theory}} of naive probability. According to the theory, individuals who are unfamiliar with the probability calculus can infer the probabilities of events in an extensional way: They construct mental models of what is true in the various possibilities. Each model represents an equiprobable alternative unless individuals have beliefs to the contrary, in which case some models will have higher probabilities than others. The probability of an event depends on the proportion of models in which it occurs. The theory predicts several phenomena of reasoning about absolute probabilities, including typical biases. It correctly predicts certain cognitive illusions in inferences about relative probabilities. It accommodates reasoning based on numerical premises, and it explains how naive reasoners can infer posterior probabilities without relying on Bayes's theorem. Finally, it dispels some common misconceptions of probabilistic reasoning. The defence were permitted <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>evidence</b> of the Bayes Theorem {{in connection with the}} statistical evaluation of the DNA profile.

40|$|Lead {{poisoning}} {{is recognized}} as a major environmental health risk and blood tests are used to assess occupational or domestic exposure <b>to</b> <b>lead.</b> <b>Evidence</b> has suggested that salivary lead concentration {{is closely related to}} recent lead exposure and may provide a useful and non-invasive indicator of lead status. Sono-electroanalysis has been shown to enhance detection of heavy metals in biological and environmental samples via the phenomena of acoustic streaming and cavitational shearing. This article therefore discusses the applicability of ultrasound enhanced square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry for the detection and determination of lead in saliva at an in situ plated Nation coated mercury thin film glassy carbon electrode. Quantitative analysis of lead in artificial saliva from a realistic sputum volume, 220 μL, introduced to acetate buffer was shown to be possible. Employing an insonated preconcentration obviated the need for lengthy or degradative sample pretreatment by liberating the lead from the glycoproteins and other materials to which it binds in solution. Rapid experimental time was facilitated by short preconcentration periods of 120 s, due to the enhanced mass transport afforded by acoustic streaming. Quantitative depassivation of the electrode surface by cavitational shearing maintained the analytical signal throughout the experiment where under silent conditions the signal diminished to zero with time. Linear standard addition plots intersect the origin as predicted for samples uncontaminated with lead and exhibit R 2 values between 0. 988 and 0. 994. The detection limit in the analyte is 0. 25 μL- 1 which for a 220 μL sputum size corresponds to 38 μL. With the onset of lead poisoning at a blood lead concentration of 100 μL- 1 this technique accesses biologically relevant lead levels...|$|E
40|$|The {{work of the}} International Criminal Court is {{characterized}} by a diversity of legal goals: indeed, its purpose {{is not limited to the}} fulfillment of a classic retributive scope, by punishing the accused for the commission of crimes within the Court's jurisdiction, but it also intends to achieve a restorative aim, giving satisfactions to the victims of the perpetrated crimes by allowing their active participation in the proceedings. Such policy has been embraced as a response to the criticisms advanced at the former international tribunals for their failure in ensuring accountability for victims of international crimes. The un-precedent role accorded to victims at the ICC raises a series of questions on different levels, as the tensions between distinct objectives shines through a sometimes un-coherent statutory framework and risks to undermine the primary scope of the ICC, i. e. the ending of impunity for the commission of serious crimes of international concern. Such disharmony among the substantive principles and norms contained in the Rome Statute may consequently affect the attribution of competence to ICC organs and culminates with the necessity of judges' intervention in order to interpret the constitutive treaty and the Rules of Procedures and Evidence to fill the statutory gaps. This paper analyses some issues of concern in respect of the above. Initially, it examines the process to obtain the status of victims before the Court and the problems related to the application procedure. Further, it continues considering the criticalities emerged at the trial stage, especially focusing on the role of the victims' legal representative and on the extent of victims' participatory rights at trial, such as the possibility <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>evidence</b> in respect of the guilt or innocence of the accused. These topics appear particularly sensitive in the light of the concept of "victim's case", which comes up besides the Prosecutor and Defense ones, as happened for the first time in the Katanga trial. The paper speculates on the challenges related to the victims' participation policy and wonders whether it might endanger the retributive scope of the ICC trial, the right of due process for the accused and even the protection of victims' security. It reaffirms the importance of granting a form of moral and material redress for victims through their involvement in the criminal proceedings, although suggesting the necessity of re-defining their role in the ICC procedure; in this perspective, it contemplates the possible consequences of a different interpretation of the concept of restorative justice, which aims to give victims the chance to be heard in Court in order to provide a meaningful contribution to the proceeding, though without assuming an active "third party" position. Ultimately, it considers if in so doing, the ICC could work more efficiently, establishing a necessary hierarchy of otherwise conflicting goals, satisfying the victims' interests and at the same time taking in due consideration both the respect of the right of a fair trial for all the parties involved in the proceedings and the material limits of the Court...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Public Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. BATTERED WOMAN SYNDROME AND CRIMINAL LIABILITY. The {{effect of}} {{prolonged}} abuse {{on a woman}} has been labelled as "learned helplessness". The theory of learned helplessness presupposes that {{a woman who is}} continuously abused by her partner will eventually accept her abuse as unavoidable and will develop a feeling of helplessness. Therefore the theory of learned helplessness gives an explanation for the psychological helplessness that battered women experience. Later the concept of learned helplessness was developed into the battered woman syndrome. The term "battered woman syndrome" refers to the physical and psychological characteristics found in the victims of prolonged abuse between intimate partners. The theory of "learned helplessness" supports the cycle of violence theory by giving an explanation for the failure of battered women to leave their abusers and to act in order to better their situation. However, when a battered woman acts and kills her abuser, the question that arises is whether her abuse can influence the general requirements of unlawfulness, conduct and fault. By successfully relying on private defence, the unlawfulness of a battered woman's conduct can be excluded. The imminence-requirement in the case of private defence can complicate a battered woman's reliance on the defence. An expansion of the imminence-requirement to accommodate murderous battered women carries the risk that battered women may misuse private defence. Battered women's reliance on private defence should therefore be restricted to cases where their abusers' attack is imminent. A battered woman can only be criminally liable for her voluntary conduct. Involuntary conduct (automatism) excludes criminal liability and is also connected to incapacity. A battered woman can rely on non-pathological incapacity as a defence. In order to be successful she will have <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>evidence</b> which indicates that she temporarily acted involuntary {{at the time of her}} abuser's killing. A battered woman's years of abuse, her helplessness and her emotional and psychological run down state of mind can also be taken into account in finding that her capacity during the killing of her abuser was diminished and that she deserves a more lenient sentence. Capacity is a prerequisite for fault. A battered woman who does not have criminal capacity will not possess any fault and will therefore not be criminally liable for the killing of her abuser. Recently some criminal law developments took place in Australia, England and Wales. These developments specifically address the situation in which battered women find themselves. The question, therefore, is whether South Africa can learn something from these developments. It appears as if South Africa will not be able to learn something from the developments in Australia. In the case of private defence, the imminence requirement was expanded in Victoria and Western Australia to accommodate battered women. It has, however, already been shown that such an expansion can lead to a misuse of private defence by battered women in South Africa. South Africa will also not be able to learn much from the reform of provocation in the Northern-Territory. The reason for this is that the South African position with regard to the defence of provocation is more advantageous than the reform of the defence in the Northern-Territory. In South Africa diminished responsibility is only taken into account for purposes of sentencing. The South African criminal law can therefore be benefited by the creation of a defence of diminished responsibility in a similar manner than the reform of diminished responsibility in England and Wales. Diminished responsibility will then constitute a complete defence which can lead to a complete acquittal for battered women who kill their abusers. To determine whether a separate defence can be created for battered women in South Africa, an investigation into suggested defences in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa was launched. Arguments for the creation of a separate defence are, however, overshadowed by the arguments against the creation of such a defence. Therefore, the creation of a separate defence for battered women is not recommended for the South African law. By accepting the battered woman syndrome as a separate defence, the South African law also runs the risk of being impaired, rather than helped. It is therefore advisable for South African courts to rather carry on treating murderous battered woman in accordance with existing, recognized grounds of justification. Master...|$|E
