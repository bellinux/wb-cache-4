2500|$|His {{reputation}} grew {{with several}} exhibitions in Germany and Switzerland in 1920. He was provided with many subjects to paint {{as he came}} to know the farmers of the area, who were amazed by Kirchner's gramophone. Kirchner writes {{of the people of}} Davos: [...] "The people who live here are proud. The hard work, which is done with great love, the way they treat animals (you very seldom see an animal being mishandled) entitle them to be proud. In most cases, work here has reached the ideal standard of being done with love. You can see it in the movements of their hands. And that, in turn, ennobles the facial expression and imbues all personal contacts with a great delicacy. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> in which democracy has become reality. Here a man’s word still counts, and you need have no fears about sleeping with your doors open. I am so happy to be allowed to be here, and through hard work I should like to thank the people for the kindness they have shown me". Kirchner began writing critiques of his own art under the pseudonym of Louis de Marsalle in order to control public opinion of him and free himself of dependence upon the art critics of the day.|$|E

50|$|Financial privacy, {{in which}} {{information}} about a person's financial transactions is guarded, {{is important for the}} avoidance of fraud including identity theft. Information about a person's purchases, for instance, can reveal a great deal about their preferences, places they have visited, their contacts, products (such as medications) they use, their activities and habits, etc. In addition to this, financial privacy also includes privacy over the bank accounts opened by individuals. Information about the bank where the individual has an account with, and whether or not <b>this</b> <b>is</b> in <b>a</b> <b>country</b> that does not share this information with other countries can help countries in fighting tax avoidance.|$|R

25|$|The anti-religious {{campaign}} {{of the past}} decade and the terror tactics of the militantly atheist regime, had effectively eliminated all public expressions of religion and communal gatherings of believers outside of the walls of the few churches (or mosques, synagogues, etc.) that still held services. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> accomplished in <b>a</b> <b>country</b> that only <b>a</b> few decades earlier had had a deeply Christian public life and culture that had developed for almost a thousand years.|$|R
