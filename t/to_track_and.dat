5|$|Although ship-fired {{missiles}} {{can provide}} support for shore-based units, they are susceptible to interception by anti-missile systems such as the Aegis Combat System and MIM-104 Patriot system developed by the United States and used by NATO nations. These systems were designed <b>to</b> <b>track</b> <b>and</b> destroy both artillery shells and missiles. The first widely reported instances of such systems working came in 1991 when the US Patriot and Royal Navy Sea Dart missile system successfully intercepted and destroyed Iraqi Scud and Silkworm missiles.|$|E

5|$|By the Korean War, {{jet engines}} had {{replaced}} propellers on aircraft, which severely limited {{the ability of}} the 20 mm and 40 mm AA batteries and their gun systems <b>to</b> <b>track</b> <b>and</b> shoot down enemy planes. Consequently, the AA guns and their associated fire-control systems were removed when reactivated. New Jersey received this treatment in 1967, and the others followed in their 1980s modernizations. In the 1980s, each ship also received a quartet of Phalanx Close in Weapon System (CIWS) mounts which made use of a radar system to locate incoming enemy projectiles and destroy them with a 20mm Gatling gun before they could strike the ship.|$|E

5|$|By May 2009 LCR {{had become}} {{insolvent}} {{and the government}} received agreement to use state aid to purchase the line and also to open it up to competition to allow other services to use it apart from Eurostar.

On 12 October 2009 a proposal was announced to sell £16billion of state assets including HS1 Ltd in the following two years to cut UK public debt.

At the end of 30years, ownership of the assets will revert to government.|$|E
