The Constitution declares that religious groups have the right <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> institutions for the education of children and to provide them religious instruction in those institutions, but provides that people cannot be discriminated against on the ground only of religion in laws relating to such institutions or the administration of such laws.

5|$|The Mk 41 Stable Vertical (also called Gun Director) was a {{vertical}} seeking gyroscope. Its function was <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> a stable earth vertical with its associated horizontal plane. With the horizontal plane established, the Mk 41 continuously measured the angles between {{the deck and}} the horizontal plane. These deck angles were continuously transmitted to the Rangekeeper {{so that it could}} keep the guns correctly elevated as the ship rolled and pitched. Mounted waist high on its side were the battery's firing keys. (see picture) The left key was the Salvo Signal Key, and it sounded the Salvo Buzzer in each of the turrets to warn the gun crews that the guns were about to fire. The center key (with bumps on its handle for tactile identification) was the Automatic Firing Key. When this key was held closed, the Mk 41 was enabled to automatically fire the guns whenever the ship's deck was parallel the horizontal plane. Also, if the sea state was such that the turrets' elevation power drives could not keep up with the ship's motion, the guns could be held at a fixed elevation, and the MK 41 could again automatically fire the guns as described. The right key was the Hand Firing Key. It bypassed the Mk 41, and fired the guns directly.|$|E

In dicarboxylic aminoaciduria, the anionic amino acid transporter, EAAT3, cannot bring glutamate and aspartate across epithelial cells, leading to them being excreted via the urine.|$|R

25|$|Ammonium {{carbamate}} {{solutions are}} notoriously corrosive to metallic construction materials, even more resistant forms of stainless steel—especially in the hottest {{parts of the}} plant such as the stripper.

Because the carbon dioxide feed is recovered from ammonia synthesis gas, it contains traces of hydrogen that can mingle with passivation air to form an explosive mixture if allowed to accumulate.|$|E

During this period of about 25 years following the end of the Second World War, the West European economies expanded at the unprecedented rate of 5 per cent per annum, nearly twice the rate recorded during any previous phase, and more than twice the average rate of growth from 1820 to 1950. ...|$|R

The use of Morse code decreased after the introduction of more reliable radios. For obvious reasons, at least one skilled radio operator had to be present (even if alone for a while) on observation posts and relay stations, as maintaining a constant connection to the base-camp and/or JOC was critical for successful outcomes.|$|E

Peer-to-peer punishment, that is, members sanction those members that do {{not contribute to the}} public good at a cost, is sufficient <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> cooperation. Such punishment is often considered altruistic, because it comes at a cost to the punisher, however, the exact nature remains to be explored. Whether costly punishment can explain cooperation is disputed. Recent research finds that costly punishment is less effective in real world environments. For example, punishment works relatively badly under imperfect information, where people cannot observe the behavior of other perfectly.|$|E
