PC-TRAX{trademark}, a commercially available dynamic software program, was chosen and applied in this {{modeling and}} analysis effort. This paper describes the development of a series of TRAX-based transient models of advanced PFBC power plants. These power plants burn coal or other suitable fuel in a PFBC, and the high temperature flue gas supports low-Btu fuel gas or natural gas combustion in a gas turbine <b>topping</b> <b>combustor.</b> When it is utilized, the low-Btu fuel gas is produced in a bubbling bed carbonizer.

This new type of plant, called a second generation or topping pressurized circulating fluidized bed combustion (topping PCFB) plant, offers the promise of efficiencies greater than 46 percent (HHV), with both emissions and a cost of electricity that are significantly lower than conventional pulverized coal fired plants with scrubbers. The topping PCFB plant incorporates the partial gasification of coal in a carbonizer, the combustion of carbonizer char in a pressurized circulating fluidized bed combustor (PCFB), and the combustion of carbonizer fuel gas in a <b>topping</b> <b>combustor</b> to achieve gas turbine inlet temperatures of 2, 300 F and higher.

40|$|In phase 1 of the project, a {{conceptual}} {{design of a}} coal-fired high performance power system was developed, and small scale R&D was done in critical areas of the design. The current Phase of the project includes development through the pilot plant stage, and design of a prototype plant that would be built in Phase 3. Goals have been identified {{that relate to the}} efficiency, emissions, costs and general operation of the system. The base case arrangement of the HIPPS cycle is shown in Figure 1. It is a combined cycle plant. This arrangement {{is referred to as the}} All Coal HIPPS because it does not require any other fuels for normal operation. A fluidized bed, air blown pyrolyzer converts coal into fuel gas and char. The char is fired in a high temperature advanced furnace (HITAF) which heats both air for a gas turbine and steam for a steam turbine. The air is heated up to 1400 F in the HITAF, and the tube banks for heating air are constructed of alloy tubes. The fuel gas from the pyrolyzer goes to a <b>topping</b> <b>combustor</b> where it is used to raise the air entering the gas turbine to 2350 F. In addition in the HITAF, steam duty is achieved with a heat recovery steam generator in the gas turbine exhaust stream and economizers in the HITAF flue gas exhaust stream. An alternative HIPPS cycle is shown in Figure 2. This arrangement uses a ceramic air heater to heat the air to temperatures above what can be achieved with alloy tubes. This arrangement is referred as the 35 % natural gas HIPPS. A pyrolyzer is used as in the base case HIPPS, but the fuel gas generated is fired upstream of the ceramic air heater instead of in the <b>topping</b> <b>combustor.</b> Gas turbine air is heated to 1400 F in alloy tubes the same as in the All Coal HIPPS.

This plant will require the MASB to operate at oxygen levels that are lower than those previously tested. Preliminary calculations aimed at defining the operating envelope of the demonstration plant MASB have been completed. Phase 3 [...] Commercial plant design update: The Second-Generation PFB Combustion Plant conceptual design prepared in 1987 is being updated to reflect the benefit of pilot plant test data and the latest advances in gas turbine technology. The updated plant is being designed to operate with 95 % sulfur capture and a single Westinghouse 501 G gas turbine. The 1987 study investigated two coal feeding arrangements, e. g., dry and paste feed. Paste feeding resulted in a lower cost of electricity. Paste, however, increases the water content of the carbonizer generated syngas; this increases the equilibrium partial pressure of hydrogen sulfide gas over calcium oxide/calcium carbonate and thereby reduces the carbonizer sulfur capture efficiency. Recognizing that the carbonizer and the CPFBC work together to control the plant overall sulfur capture efficiency, the higher CPFBC efficiency can compensate for the carbonizer's lower sulfur capture efficiency depending upon the amount of coal and/or char being fed to each unit. Since the latter are determined by the overall plant heat and material balance, they prepared a balance for each feed case to enable selection of the plant coal feed system...|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} on the gasification of bituminous coal with air and steam in a 2. 5 kW atmospheric fluidized bed. Thermal conversion efficiencies, the retention of sulphur and the conversion of fuel nitrogen to NH 3 were determined fbr various oxygen-to-carbon ratios (equivalence ratios between 0. 58 and 0. 82), with and without limestone in the bed. The conversion efficiency increased with increasing equivalence ratio, while the conversion of fuel-nitrogen to NH 3 decreased with increasing equivalence ratio. The sulphur conversion without the addition of limestone increased with increasing equivalence ratio. As expected, the presence of limestone in the bed led to increased sulphur retention, more so at {{the high and low}} ends than at intermediate values of the range Of equivalence ratios. In addition, limestone adversely affected thermal conversion efficiency and increased the conversion of fuel-nitrogen.

Preliminary calculations aimed at defining the operating envelope of the demonstration plant MASB have been completed. The previous MASB tests have been performed at UTSI in a facility constructed to support the development of MHD power generation. Because of a loss of MHD funding, the UTSI facility closed October 1998. On February 2, 1999, Siemens Westinghouse proposed a 12 -week study that would identify the cost of modifying the MASB for Lakeland low oxygen operation conditions and conducting tests 3 and 4 above at the Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC). On February 22, 1999, Siemens Westinghouse was given release to proceed with this study and results/recommendations were received on April 22, 1999. Siemens Westinghouse recommended a two-phase test effort. The first test effort would entail two 6 -hour tests beginning November 1999 with the MASB operated with natural gas and ''cold'' compressor air. The MASB would be tested at full Lakeland pressure using the physical configuration planned for operation at lower pressure at Wilsonville in September 1999. As a result, the MASB test specimen would be a totally new unit (not a modification of a previously UTSI tested unit). The MASB would be installed in an existing AEDC test shell as shown in Fig. 1. Although the internals currently installed within the shell would have to be removed and reinstalled at the completion of the first test phase, no major facility modifications external to the shell are needed; this first test effort was estimated to cost $ 1. 2 million. Although the second test effort was not the subject of this initial study, Siemens Westinghouse envisioned it being conducted in another AEDC test cell that is currently mothballed. The facility has been well preserved and it would be modified to permit syngas testing with both cold and hot vitiated air; these tests would not be conducted until the fall 2000 and were estimated to cost $ 3. 2 million. Written questions were submitted to Siemens Westinghouse regarding their proposed test programs; their responses and cost estimates were transmitted to FETC on April 30, 1999. Review of the proposed programs by FETC revealed that they exceeded existing funding limits, and all further Phase 2 work was put on hold until additional funding becomes available...|$|E

The design of the char burner was completed during this quarter. The burner is designed for arch-firing and has a maximum capacity of 30 MMBtu/hr. This size represents a half scale version of a typical commercial burner. The burner is outfitted with nozzles for separate injection of char, coal, and limestone. Burner performance will be rated according to three criteria, carbon conversion efficiency, NOx generation, and flame stability. If initial testing in the arch configuration proves successful, further tests will be performed in the wall-fired arrangement. A complete set of process and instrumentation drawings (P/ID's) were completed for the Combustion and Environmental Test Facility (CETF) this quarter. These drawings established an ISA approved instrument tagging structure, and provided a coherent database {{for the development of a}} data acquisition system. The data acquisition system polls tag information (value, range, engineering units, etc.) from the distributed control system (DCS) highway, and provides a platform for data reduction. The quadrupole mass spectrometer, used during the pyrolyzer tests performed at the pilot plant in Livingston, N. J., has been redesigned for use at the CETF. The mass spectrometer is designed to provide on-line gas analysis by identifying all of the chemical components within the secondary air line, the flue gas recycle line, and the furnace exit ducting. The construction effort at the CETF continued this quarter with the completion of the char storage system, reheat burner, flue gas recycle piping, and the pulverized coal feed system...|$|E
