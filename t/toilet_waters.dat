5000|$|Some Eau de toilette {{were once}} {{considered}} restorative skin toners with medical benefits. The journal Medical Record reported in 1905 that a <b>toilet</b> <b>water</b> spray restores energies lost in business, social, and domestic situations. During the fourteenth through sixteenth centuries {{a type of}} <b>toilet</b> <b>water</b> called [...] "plague waters" [...] was supposed to drive away the bubonic plague.|$|R
5000|$|Perfume oils {{are often}} diluted with a solvent, {{though this is}} not always the case, and its {{necessity}} is disputed. By far the most common solvent for perfume oil dilution is ethanol or a mixture of ethanol and water. Perfume has a mixture of about 10-20% perfume oils mixed with alcohol (acting as a diffusing agent delivering the fragrant odor) and a trace of water. Colognes have about 3-5% perfume oil mixed with 80-90% alcohol with about 5 to 15 percent water in the mix. Originally, eau de cologne was a mixture of citrus oils from such fruits as lemons, oranges, tangerines, limes, and grapefruits. These were combined with such substances as lavender and neroli (orange-flower oil). Toilet water has the least amount of perfume oil mixture among the three main liquid [...] "perfumery" [...] categories. It has only about 2 to 8 percent of some type of perfume oil and 60-80% alcohol dispersent with water making up the difference. <b>Toilet</b> <b>waters</b> are a less concentrated form of these above types of alcohol-based perfumes. Traditionally cologne is usually made of citrus oils and fragrances, while <b>toilet</b> <b>waters</b> are not limited to this specification.|$|E
5000|$|The {{resulting}} fragrance {{line was}} known as the Empress Floral Perfumes and <b>Toilet</b> <b>Waters</b> and also the Flower-in-the-Bottle perfumes.

He also created a sample set for this line that was {{in the form of a}} miniature book named [...] "The Story of the Flower by Blocki" [...] and contained four perfume samples each with a preserved flower.|$|E
5000|$|Paper wine labels {{have long}} been collected. This can turn into a {{full-fledged}} hobby, with collections organized by theme, country, or region. For others, saving labels {{may be part of}} maintaining a wine tasting-notes journal, or just simply to remember a particular wine. Wine labels, or Bottle Tickets, are also an area of interest to collectors. The Wine Label Circle http://www.winelabelcircle.org was formed in 1952. These objects of silver, mother-of-pearl, ivory or enamel were, in the 18th and 19th centuries, used to identify the contents of the decanter or bottle on which they were hung, the contents of which may have included in addition to wines and spirits, sauces, condiments, flavourings, perfumes, <b>toilet</b> <b>waters,</b> medicines, inks, soft drinks, preserves and cordials ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the fourteenth}} century Hungarian Eau de toilette, {{predecessor}} of eau de cologne, was produced. Queen Elisabeth of Hungary (1305-1380) had created a fragrant oil mix with alcohol that evaporated slowly on her skin. Hungary Water was the first <b>toilet</b> <b>water</b> developed. This <b>toilet</b> <b>water</b> was called [...] "eau de la reine de hongrie", and was based on rosemary.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the early}} 1900s, makeup was not {{excessively}} popular. In fact, women hardly wore makeup at all. Make-up {{at this time}} was still mostly the territory of ladies of the night, those in cabarets and on the black & white screen. Face enamelling (applying actual paint to the face) became popular among the rich {{at this time in}} an attempt to look paler. This practice was dangerous due to the main ingredient often being arsenic. [...] Pale skin was associated with wealth because it meant you were not out working in the sun and could afford to stay inside all day. Cosmetics were so unpopular that they could not be bought in department stores; they could only be bought at theatrical costume stores. A woman’s [...] "makeup routine" [...] often only consisted of using papier poudré, a powdered paper/oil blotting sheet, to whiten the nose in the winter and shine their cheeks in the summer. Rouge was considered provocative, so was only seen on [...] "women of the night." [...] Some women used burnt matchsticks to darken eyelashes, and geranium and poppy petals to stain the lips. [...] Vaseline became high in demand because it was used on chapped lips, as a base for hair tonic, and soap. [...] <b>Toilet</b> <b>waters</b> were introduced in the early 1900s, but only lavender water or refined cologne was admissible for women to wear. [...] Cosmetic deodorant was invented in 1888, by an unknown inventor from Philadelphia and was trademarked under the name Mum (deodorant). Roll-on deodorant was launched in 1952, and aerosol deodorant in 1965.|$|E
