5|$|Another {{approach}} to brain {{function is to}} examine <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of damage to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes {{and other types of}} brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> for behavior.|$|E

5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent. He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability. Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil in order to understand <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.|$|E

40|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>Consequence</b> Argument, <b>the</b> {{truth of}} {{determinism}} plus other plausible principles would yield {{the conclusion that}} we have no free will. In this paper I will argue that the conception of determinism typically employed in the various versions of <b>the</b> <b>Consequence</b> Argument is not plausible. In particular, I will argue that, taken most straightforwardly, determinism as defined in <b>the</b> <b>Consequence</b> Argument would imply that the existence of God is logically impossible. This is quite an implausible result. The truth or falsity of determinism is typically taken to be a contingent, empirical matter. But how could the empirical discovery that determinism is true lead to the conclusion that God’s existence is a logical impossibility? The defender of <b>the</b> <b>Consequence</b> Argument can avoid this conclusion, but only at the cost of making other similarly implausible claims...|$|R
