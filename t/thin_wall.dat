5|$|Like all primates, strepsirrhine orbits (eye sockets) have a postorbital bar, a {{protective}} ring of bone {{created by a}} connection between the frontal and zygomatic bones. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines lack a <b>thin</b> <b>wall</b> of bone behind the eye, referred to as postorbital closure, which is only seen in haplorhine primates. Although the eyes of strepsirrhines point forward, giving stereoscopic vision, the orbits do not face fully forward. Among living strepsirrhines, most or all species are thought to possess a reflective layer behind the retina of the eye, called a tapetum lucidum (consisting of riboflavin crystals), which improves vision in low light, but they lack a fovea, which improves day vision. This differs from tarsiers, which lack a tapetum lucidum but possess a fovea.|$|E
5|$|With {{all of the}} {{evidence}} of the Bay Harbor Butcher murders pointing to Doakes as the killer, the case is closed. Forensic investigator Vince Masuka (C. S. Lee) tells Dexter the gas in the cabin was turned on while the stove was lit, and when Dexter sees his own satellite navigation system while cataloging evidence, he realizes that Lila must have found the cabin. He meets with her at the aquarium and tells her that he, like her, has no emotion and lives a life devoid of feeling. They form plans to leave Miami together, though Dexter secretly intends to kill her. When he visits her apartment the next day, though, he finds Debra there, trying to persuade Lila to leave town. Dexter is forced to lie about running away with Lila in front of Debra, so a hurt Lila then leaves with what she recognizes as Dexter's bag of murder equipment. She goes to Rita's house and drugs the babysitter so that she can abduct the children, Astor and Cody (Christina Robinson and Preston Bailey). When Dexter realizes that Astor and Cody are missing, he goes straight to Lila's apartment, where she lights another fire and locks the three of them inside. Rita calls Debra for her help, and Debra decides to skip her flight to Oregon with Lundy to help with finding the children. Dexter manages to free Astor and Cody through a small window and eventually rams down a <b>thin</b> <b>wall</b> allowing him to escape.|$|E
25|$|Intraradical {{mycelium}} {{was observed}} in root intracellular spaces, and arbuscules were observed in the layer <b>thin</b> <b>wall</b> cells similar to palisade parenchyma.

50|$|Generally, <b>thinner</b> <b>walls</b> {{are more}} {{feasible}} with small parts {{rather than with}} large ones. The limiting factor in wall thinness is the tendency for the plastic material in <b>thin</b> <b>walls</b> to cool and solidify before the mold is filled. The shorter the material flow, the <b>thinner</b> the <b>wall</b> can be. Walls also should be as uniform in thickness as possible to avoid warpage from uneven shrinkage. When changes in wall thickness are unavoidable, the transition should be gradual and not abrupt.|$|R

25|$|It is the {{simplest}} repeating pattern, and {{will create a}} wall only one-half brick thick. Such a <b>thin</b> <b>wall</b> is not stable enough to stand alone, and must be tied to a supporting structure. This practice is common in modern buildings, where stretcher bonded brickwork may be the outer face of a cavity wall, or the facing to a timber or steel-framed structure.|$|E
25|$|Low energy photon {{radiation}} such as low energy X rays or gamma rays interacts {{better with the}} fill gas. Consequently, a typical design for low energy photon detection for these is a long tube with a <b>thin</b> <b>wall</b> or with an end window. The tube has a larger gas volume than a steel walled tube to give an increased chance of particle interaction.|$|E
25|$|Fort Campbell is very {{different}} from earlier fortifications in Malta, such as the bastioned forts built by the Knights Hospitaller and the polygonal forts built by the British in the 19th century. Due to the new threat of aerial warfare, the fort was surrounded by a <b>thin</b> <b>wall,</b> and the buildings were placed at a distance from each other. Due to this, the fort was camouflaged as from the air it resembled the field walls of the surrounding countryside. Unlike many of the earlier fortifications, Fort Campbell was designed with an eye to functionality rather than aesthetics. For example, the fort's gateway is just a breach in the perimeter wall defended by a guard room, in contrast with the usually ornate gates of many Hospitaller or Victorian forts.|$|E

25|$|Because each nest {{represents}} a separate colony, there are exceptionally small colonies, {{which are a}} clear adaptation to {{the high degree of}} environmental variability. A large colony requires either many small nest chambers or a few larger ones. The exchange between the many small chambers will increase the time the workers spend outside the nests and therefore also the degree of predation. More important for this species is the possibility of being washed away by the tide, waves or heavy rainstorms. Large nest cavities require very long hollowed twigs, which break easily during strong winds, potentially resulting in the ants being washed away. Larger cavities in thicker branches require the ants to excavate hard wood, which {{did not seem to be}} the case for this species. A more serious problem is the coccids, which primarily require cavities with a <b>thin</b> <b>wall.</b> Finally, a large cavity with several entrances and a large volume of air is much more difficult to keep waterproof during flooding.|$|E

In his charge to the Tech squad, Heisman became flowery and fiery. He brought the heroes of ancient Greece and the soldier dead in his armor among the ruins of Pompeii. It was terrific and the Panthers sat, spellbound. When Heisman had finished, Warner chortled and quietly said to his players: 'Okay, boys. There's the speech. Now go out and knock them off.' ...|$|E

[...] If a pair of pits is dug in fresh snow with a <b>thin</b> <b>wall</b> between them {{and one of the}} pits is roofed over, an observer in the roofed pit will see the layers revealed by sunlight shining through. [...] A six-foot pit may show anything from less than a year of snow to several years of snow, depending on the location. [...] Poles left in the snow from year to year show the amount of accumulated snow each year, and this can be used to verify that the visible layer in a snow pit corresponds to a single year's snowfall.|$|E
500|$|John Heisman, {{now head}} coach of Georgia Tech (also undefeated), {{challenged}} Warner to a post-season game. Warner declined and the game was postponed until the following season, giving Tech the 1917 national championship (the first for any Southern school). On November 23, 1918 the two teams played at Pittsburgh. At the stadium where the game was to be played, the locker rooms were next to each other, with only a <b>thin</b> <b>wall</b> separating the two teams prior to the game. Heisman was first to begin an inspirational speech and {{it was said that}} he passionately described both heroes of Ancient Greece as well as the tragedy of a soldier found in his armor among the ruins of Pompeii. Because of Georgia Tech's players silence the speech was crystal clear {{on the other side of}} the wall. Upon its finish Warner smiled and quietly told his players [...] "Okay, boys. There's the speech. Now go out and knock them off." [...] Pittsburgh defeated Georgia Tech 32–0.|$|E
500|$|Landslides {{more than}} once dammed the Virgin River and created lakes where {{sediment}} accumulated. Every time the river eventually breached the slide and drained the lake, leaving a flat-bottomed valley. About 7,000years ago, the relatively <b>thin</b> <b>wall</b> between two closely spaced joints in the Navajo Sandstone collapsed. The resulting Sand Bench landslide blocked Zion Canyon just east of The Sentinel, creating [...] Sentinel Lake. Another notable stand was created about 4,000years ago when Sentinel Slide impounded the North Fork Virgin River, creating a lake that backed up to Weeping Rock. The current site of Zion Lodge was under about [...] of water for around 700years. Evidence of valley floors created by these lakes {{can be seen from}} Zion Canyon Scenic Drive south of Zion Lodge near Sentinel Slide. Recent landslides in 1923, 1941, and 1995 have temporarily dammed the Virgin River. Prior to the initial Sand Bench landslide, the Virgin River flowed 70ft (21m) lower in elevation than it does today.|$|E

When Dexter breaks up with Lila, she retaliates by pursuing his co-worker and friend, Angel Batista (David Zayas). In [...] "There's Something About Harry," [...] Rita and Dexter reconcile and visit the beach together.

2500|$|Successively {{from the}} first dynasty to the twenty-sixth dynasty, nine or ten temples were built on one site at Abydos. The first was an enclosure, about , {{surrounded}} by a <b>thin</b> <b>wall</b> of unbaked bricks. Incorporating one wall of this first structure, the second temple of about [...] square was built within a wall about [...] thick. An outer temenos (enclosure) wall surrounded the grounds. This outer wall was thickened about {{the second or third}} dynasty. The old temple entirely vanished in the fourth dynasty, and a smaller building was erected behind it, enclosing a wide hearth of black ashes. Pottery models of offerings are found in these ashes and probably were the substitutes for live sacrifices decreed by Khufu (or Cheops) in his temple reforms.|$|E
2500|$|Cheaper steel bicycle {{frames are}} made of mild steel, also called high tensile steel, such as {{might be used to}} {{manufacture}} automobiles or other common items.

One of the most successful older steels was Reynolds [...] "531", a manganese-molybdenum alloy steel. More common now is 4130 ChroMoly or similar alloys. Reynolds [...] and Columbus are two of the most famous manufacturers of bicycle tubing. A few medium-quality bicycles used these steel alloys for only some of the frame tubes.

The Insight has a body weight {{less than half that}} of the contemporary Civic 3-door, with increased torsional rigidity by 38% and bending rigidity by 13%. Honda built the Insight with aluminum front brake calipers and rear brake drums, and with a largely aluminum suspension, in addition to standard aluminum wheels; reducing the ratio of un-sprung to sprung weight as well as the total weight. The fuel tank is plastic; the engine mounts were aluminum; and the exhaust is a small, <b>thin</b> <b>wall</b> pipe. Its compact spare is also aluminum.
