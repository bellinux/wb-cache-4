5|$|The {{spread of}} English from {{the latter half}} of the 20th century has been helped in part by the {{cultural}} and economic influence of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>itself</b> originally formed from British colonies. Except in Africa where nearly all the former colonies have adopted the presidential system, the English parliamentary system has served as the template for the governments for many former colonies, and English common law for legal systems.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} aircraft engines of the World War II era, some fifty marks of Merlin were built by Rolls-Royce in Derby, Crewe and Glasgow, as well as by Ford of Britain at their Trafford Park factory, near Manchester. A de-rated version was also the basis of the very successful Rolls-Royce/Rover Meteor tank engine. Post-war, the Merlin was largely superseded by the Rolls-Royce Griffon for military use, with most Merlin variants being designed and built for airliners and military transport aircraft. Production ceased in 1956 with the fulfilment of an order for 170 Merlins for the Spanish Air Force's CASA 2.111 and Hispano Aviación HA-1112 aircraft, after 160,000 engines had been delivered. In addition, the Packard V-1650 was a version of the Merlin built in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>itself</b> produced in numbers upwards of 55,000 examples, and was the principal engine used in the North American P-51 Mustang.|$|E

25|$|In 1861, as <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>itself</b> became massively {{divided over}} {{regional}} issues, {{leading to the}} American Civil War (1861–1865), the western regions of Virginia split with the eastern portion politically, and the two were never reconciled as a single state again. In 1863, the western region {{was admitted to the}} Union as a new separate state, initially planned to be called the State of Kanawha, but ultimately named West Virginia.|$|E
25|$|Many in the Chinese {{intellectual}} community {{believed that}} the United States had done little to convince the imperialist powers (especially Britain, France, and Japan) {{to adhere to the}} Fourteen Points, and observed that <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>itself</b> had declined to join the League of Nations; as a result they turned away from the Western liberal democratic model. Marxism began to take hold in Chinese intellectual thought, particularly among those already on the Left. It was during this time that communism was studied seriously by some Chinese intellectuals such as Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao.|$|E
25|$|The United States also {{threatened}} to accuse Argentina {{of being involved}} with the coup of Gualberto Villarroel in Bolivia, and a plot to receive weapons from Germany, after the allied refusal, to face the possible threat of either <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>itself</b> or Brazil acting on their behalf. However, it would be unlikely that Germany would provide such weapons, given their fragile situation in 1944. Ramírez called a new meeting of the GOU, and it was agreed to break diplomatic relations with the Axis powers (albeit without yet a declaration of war) on January 26, 1944.|$|E

25|$|Expansion into Mexico {{affected}} the political balance between pro- and anti-slavery states. To allow {{slavery in the}} newly acquired Mexican territory would be to allow slave-holding states to have greater representation in Congress, an idea that the North did not favor. Though the South had a smaller population, it sent and suffered greater casualties in the war than the North, which had disapproved of the effort. Southerners felt that the Wilmot Proviso, which would have banned slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico, was unjust, since the South had risked more lives to win the Southwest. This disagreement {{was one of many}} factors leading up the Civil War. The expansion of the United States into Mexico caused increasing tensions within <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>itself,</b> as well as between the United States and Mexico.|$|E
25|$|After a {{succession}} crisis, {{most of the}} Mormons united under Brigham Young, who organized an evacuation from Nauvoo and from <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>itself</b> after the federal government refused to protect the Mormons. Young and an eventual 50,000–70,000 would cross the Great Plains to settle in the Salt Lake Valley and the surrounding area. After {{the events of the}} Mexican–American War, the area became a United States territory. Young immediately petitioned for the addition of the State of Deseret, but the federal government declined. Instead, Congress carved out the much smaller Utah Territory. Over the next 46 years, several actions of the federal government were directed at Mormons, specifically to curtail the practice of polygamy and to reduce their political and economic power. These included the Utah War, Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act, Poland Act, Edmunds Act, and Edmunds–Tucker Act. In 1890, LDS Church president Wilford Woodruff issued the Manifesto, ending polygamy.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920 United States presidential {{election}} Republican candidate Warren Harding criticized the occupation and promised eventual U.S. withdrawal. While Jimenes and Vásquez sought concessions from the United States, {{the collapse of}} sugar prices discredited the military government and {{gave rise to a}} new nationalist political organization, the Dominican National Union, led by Dr. Henríquez from exile in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, which demanded unconditional withdrawal. They formed alliances with frustrated nationalists in Puerto Rico and Cuba, as well as critics of the occupation in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>itself,</b> most notably The Nation and the Haiti-San Domingo Independence Society. In May 1922, a Dominican lawyer, Francisco Peynado, went to Washington, D.C. and negotiated {{what became known as the}} Hughes–Peynado Plan. It stipulated immediate establishment of a provisional government pending elections, approval of all laws enacted by the U.S. military government, and the continuation of the 1907 treaty until all the Dominican Republic's foreign debts had been settled. On October 1, Juan Bautista Vicini, the son of a wealthy Italian immigrant sugar planter, was named provisional president, and the process of U.S. withdrawal began.|$|E

25|$|Lt. General Vernon A. Walters, a {{military}} attaché of Dwight Eisenhower and later military attaché in France from 1967–1973, noted the {{strong relationship between}} de Gaulle and Eisenhower, de Gaulle's unconditional support of Eisenhower during the U-2 incident, and de Gaulle's strong support of John F. Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Thus Walters was intensely curious as to the great contrast between de Gaulle's close relations with two United States presidents during notable Cold War crises and de Gaulle's later decision to withdraw France from NATO's military command, and Walters spoke with many close military and political aides of de Gaulle. Walters' conclusion, based upon de Gaulle's comments to many of his aides (and to Eisenhower during a meeting at Ramboullet Castle in 1959), is that de Gaulle feared that later United States presidents after Eisenhower would not have Eisenhower's special ties to Europe and would not risk nuclear war over Europe. Also, de Gaulle interpreted the peaceful resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis without fighting to take back Cuba from communism a mere 90 miles from the United States as {{an indication that the}} United States might not fight for Europe's defense 3,500 miles away following Soviet aggression in Europe, but would only go to war following a nuclear strike against <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>itself.</b> De Gaulle told Eisenhower that France did not seek to compete with the Strategic Air Command or army of the United States, but believed that France needed a way to strike the Soviet Union.|$|E
500|$|All of the United States' 50 {{states have}} a state motto, as do the District of Columbia and three US territories. A motto is a phrase {{intended}} to formally describe the general motivation or intention of an organization. State mottos can sometimes be found on state seals or state flags. Some states have officially designated a state motto {{by an act of}} the state legislature, whereas other states have the motto only as an element of their seals. The motto of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>itself</b> is In God We Trust, proclaimed by Congress and signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on July 30, 1956. The motto E Pluribus Unum (Latin for [...] "One from many") was approved for use on the Great Seal of the United States in 1782, but was never adopted as the national motto through legislative action.|$|E
500|$|The McCarran Internal Security Act, {{which became}} law in 1950, has been {{described}} by scholar Ellen Schrecker as [...] "the McCarthy era's only important piece of legislation" [...] (the Smith Act technically predated McCarthyism). However, the McCarran Act had no real effect beyond legal harassment. It required the registration of Communist organizations with the U.S. Attorney General and established the Subversive Activities Control Board to investigate possible Communist-action and Communist-front organizations so they could be required to register. Due to numerous hearings, delays and appeals, the act was never enforced, even with regard to the Communist Party of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>itself,</b> and the major provisions of the act were found to be unconstitutional in 1965 and 1967. In 1952, the Immigration and Nationality, or McCarran–Walter, Act was passed. This law allowed the government to deport immigrants or naturalized citizens engaged in subversive activities and also to bar suspected subversives from entering the country.|$|E
