40|$|This article {{examines}} the local outcomes of São Paulo city’s engagement in transnational networks for climate protection. The participation of municipalities in such networks {{has been an important}} driver in fostering local initiatives to protect global climate. There have been accounts of many cases of mitigation measures implemented successfully at the local level, demonstrating significant carbon emissions reductions, thus helping national governments in their emissions reductions efforts. However, few studies have explored the linkages between transnational engagement, implementation of subnational climate action, and the actual national commitments in developing countries. This paper assesses the role of local engagement in transnational networks in the adoption and implementation of climate policies and legislation in the city of São Paulo, {{and its impact on the}} Brazilian government’s climate action, in the period between 2002 and 2014. São Paulo was an active member of ICLEI’s Cities for Climate Protection campaign and the C 40 network during this period. The city was the first government to adopt legislation establishing reduction targets in 2009. However, while <b>transnational</b> <b>action</b> influenced the inception of the city’s climate change policy, it has had limited impact on the implementation of climate action beyond the municipal level.

Zapata-Barrero (in press) sees in these two phenomena an overlapping situation.

This perspective involves two levels of analysis which are in fact interconnected, and two interdependent modes of identification: local (territorial) and global or transnational (non-territorial). The juxtaposition of communities as a source of tension in some localities might not create an identification with “the place” because of the strength of transnational networks.|$|E

The article begins by analyzing the conditions of the emergence of this notion on the international political scene. Based on the study of a transnational collective action on the one hand, and of the Senegalese case on the other, the article then states the hypothesis that the notion of food sovereignty is appropriated by different actors, at times of transnational mobilizations, in order to support national objectives. Thus, the emergence of food sovereignty participates in the politicization of food debates on the international political scene.

However, social actors within GCS occupy unequal positions of power in relation to each other. This article examines how the discourses of <b>transnational</b> <b>action</b> generated by these actors are inflected by their different power positions and how these discursive activities provide spaces for learning divergent forms of global citizenship. This discussion is facilitated through {{a case study of}} a transnational campaign involving two unequal actors in GCS — a grassroots movement (NBA) in the Narmada Valley and supporting international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) in the West. It is argued that INGO discourses reiterated their power over NBA and provided a space for learning `vertical' forms of global citizenship. Contrastingly, NBA discursively subverted these asymmetries and promoted `horizontal' global citizenship. The article concludes by examining pedagogical implications of these findings for GCS...|$|E

A typology of transnational movement networking is presented and then specific instances are examined: (a) the Italian and Greek trade union confederations’ efforts to coordinate their actions for the European Days of Action; (b) the 2005 / 2006 attempt to import to Greece the experience and practices of precarious workers in Italy; and (c) the cross-national campaign by workers occupying factories to bring together their experiences and to construct a common discourse on alternative modes of production. The article, based on rich empirical data gathered during six years, concludes with three main points: (i) Collaborative networks {{are more difficult to}} construct, but may prove stronger and richer than any other networking type.

30|$|Other {{variables}} {{also indicate}} {{the importance of}} circulating between destination and origin for ongoing non-mobile cross-border engagement. On one hand, the number of trips (i.e. previous stays {{of at least one}} year in the same country) is highly predictive of transnational engagement: each additional prior trip is associated with a 7.2 percentage-point increase in the probability of remitting. Repeat migration (approximately 30  % of the sample reported more than one trip) thus reinforces the transnational social field {{in such a way as}} to make non-mobile <b>transnational</b> <b>action</b> more likely for both individual and collective activities. On the other hand, migrants who reported planning to stay definitively in the destination country (as reported by 46  % of the sample) are 10 percentage points less likely to remit than those who do not plan to stay definitively, indicating that remitting is integral to Senegalese migrants’ ability to prepare an eventual return to Senegal. Migrants who reported having migrated principally for work or in search of a better life are 14 percentage points more likely to remit, suggesting that those migrants with motivations of accumulation are more likely to participate in financial cross-border action.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{international}} society {{is characterized by}} two major, global tendencies of normative significance: an increasing political, economic and social interdependence, and a deep controversy between a sovereignty norm of non-intervention and a responsibility norm calling for <b>transnational</b> <b>action</b> to protect people across borders. The background for this tension should be found in history; in the Westphalian international system, and the traditional cosmopolitanist approach, respectively. Because of the rising level of interdependence, this battle between norms is played out on a broad field of international issues from security and humanitarian intervention to trade talks and economic development. Since {{the end of the}} Cold War the East-West divide has been substituted for a division between a North-West side acting upon a universalist, rights-based norm, and a South-East side defending sovereignty and pluralism. Some in the latter camp tend to regard humanitarian concerns of the North-West as a smoke screen for hegemonic, economic and strategic interests. In order to overcome this new division, both the sovereignty norm and the cosmopolitanist aspirations may have to be redefined through new ways of thinking legitimacy in international society...|$|E
40|$|European social {{movements}} improve {{the well-being of}} men and women but need further analysis through a gender-sensitive lens. Taking an international and cross-disciplinary perspective, this book examines the impact of European {{social movements}} on gendered political and material well-being. Insights from history, politics, sociology and gender studies help identify how social movements have been instrumental in changing individual well-being through participation and empowerment. These movements have contributed to collective well-being thanks to victories in health, sexualities, political recognition and access to material goods. The contributions pay particular attention to the role of women activists in social movements varying from unions and religious movements to the women's movement itself. The settings range from 19 th century Catalonia to Switzerland and Poland, including studies on European transnational movements today and their impact on global gendered well-being. The authors consider how gender has been important in defining the goals, strategies and outcomes of social movements. Thanks to the international spread of contributions a comparative record can be examined. Together the authors provide unique and concrete illustrations of the role of collective action and the participatory process on transforming women and well-being in European societies. The book provides essential insights for students and scholars working on social and women's movements, European well-being and welfare, and <b>transnational</b> <b>action...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{introduction}} {{describes the}} rapidly expanding history of non-state humanitarianism {{in terms of}} three themes. First, it argues that we should think about humanitarianism less in terms of ruptures or breaks, and {{focus more on the}} moments of acceleration and the continuities that shaped that narrative: how the relationships among local, national and international discourses were played out in the shift between imperial and post-colonial worlds, in the dialogue between religious and secular traditions, and in the transformative processes of decolonization, de-regulation and globalization. Second, we suggest the need to re-think the geography of non-state humanitarianism. Drawing attention to the transnational contexts and traditions in which ideas of humanitarianism have been articulated not only adds to our understanding of <b>transnational</b> <b>action</b> and the strength of global civil society beyond the West, we argue, it allows us to better appreciate the myriad languages and practices of humanitarianism employed in a global context. Finally, this introduction also re-visits the question of motivation. By looking beyond the state, we argue, we can better understand the variety of motives that shaped the act of giving: from compassion to capturing markets, the search for efficiency, and the construction of local, national and international identities. 2017 - 09 - 1...|$|E

Whatever the ideology and objective in the understanding of integration, states are confronted today with the <b>transnational</b> <b>actions</b> of activists who try to bypass states in order to reach a global perspective of their identification and action. Solidarity beyond borders involves a multilevel interaction between home and host countries and leads the states to develop strategies of integration – territorial and non-territorial – as a way of including identity issues developed in a minority situation into their political strategy to “re-territorialize” them. The objective then is to counter non-territorial solidarity expressed in global religious terms, mostly virtual, diffused by the Internet, which attracts the young generation, urging them to reject any or all national identification, to develop a new pride, a sense of community based on a global identification.|$|R

30|$|In this configuration, {{politics}} of integration {{are not a}} single state policy. States (home and host) cooperate for integration to insure re-territorialization of globalized identities with <b>transnational</b> <b>action.</b> In the case of transational Islam, these actions are promoted by international organizations through images, symbols and speeches, founded on a religious and/or ideological identification. As for Muslims in Europe, they express their attachment to the country of settlement in terms of citizenship and rights. They express also their loyalty to the country of origin in terms of emotions and identity. Being a “Muslim minority in Europe” {{has created a new}} “imagined global diaspora” and that brings a third dimension based upon a religious identification that is transnational both in essence and definition, and which goes beyond Europe. Werbner (2002) shows how “imagining their different diasporas, local Pakistani tended to position themselves imaginatively as the heroes of global battles”, and argues that “diasporas are transnational communities of co-responsibility”. In an “imagined global diaspora” where individuals and groups and transnational communities are connected in global networks, the traditional diaspora loses its territorial bases, in which home is an imagined place to express precisely “co-responsibility” without a territorial reference as “home”, more over so for the younger generation who has an abstract image of the home country of their parents.|$|E
40|$|Many {{contemporary}} {{issues of}} development and governance are complex beyond the capacities of single institutions or countries. As a result, in recent years we have seen growing attention paid {{to the importance of}} networks – ranging from advocacy networks to multi-stakeholder partnerships – for the solution of development problems. This paper is particularly interested in the construction of <b>transnational</b> <b>action</b> research networks that effectively bridge the differences that separate the local from the global, practice from research, North from South, and many relevant disciplines from one another. Such networks must span inequalities in power and resources as well as differences in cultural and intellectual perspectives. Using a unique ‘insider-outsider’ perspective, the paper examines the emergence (during the period 2000 – 2005) of the Development Research Centre on Citizenship, Participation and Accountability, a network of seven partners – from the UK, India, Bangladesh, Nigeria, South Africa, Mexico and Brazil – concerned with research, capacity building and policy influence on these issues. This case is interesting for several reasons. First the research available on long-term collaboration between Northern and Southern research institutions is very limited. Second, the longitudinal study offers opportunities for understanding development processes that are not visible to the more common comparisons of cases at one time in their history. Finally this research also offers opportunities to look at the challenges of building transnational networks as they emerge across several levels. These represent the areas that are not well developed in existing research on inter-organisational networks. Keywords: action research, research partnerships, networks, citizenship...|$|E

Nowadays, new migrants’ generations can practice daily a biography liberated from territorial constraints, being “here and there” {{at the same time}} and able to take decision and act over the borders. Information and communication technologies (ICT) are intrinsically related to new networked ways of being, generating new patterns of <b>transnational</b> <b>action.</b> They facilitate both a transnational mobilization around local and specific aims, and local actions based on more universal principles. In addition, the use of ICTs by highly skilled migrants, endowed with high human, social and cultural capital, give place to innovative collaborative strategies. This paper aims to approach and explain some outcomes of the Romanian scientific migration by integrating this new reality. First, a short theoretical review will highlight the recent renewal of brain migration approaches, with specific focus on “diaspora networks”. Then, the study of a website and a related virtual network (www. ad-astra. ro) of Romanian scientists scattered around the world will enable the analysis of the role of e-practices in the emergence of a transnational space in which migrants and non-migrants meet and act jointly in a new transnational public sphere. In this way, this paper will account for the emergence of a Romanian scientific e-diaspora, its impact on the scientific and research reform in Romania and its contribution to transnationally enable local change and reverse brain drain...|$|E

This role is currently threatened by the increasingly authoritarian strain in EU's new economic governance (NEG).

After the financial crisis, the latter has been complemented by vertical integration effected through the direct surveillance of member states. The resulting NEG opens contradictory possibilities for labour movements in Europe. On the one hand, the reliance of the NEG on vertical surveillance makes decisions taken in its name more tangible, offering concrete targets for contentious <b>transnational</b> collective <b>action.</b> On the other hand, however, the NEG mimics the governance structures of multinational firms, by using key performance indicators that put countries in competition with one another.
