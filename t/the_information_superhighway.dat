Vagal and spinal afferents also express {{a wide range of}} membrane receptors to a variety of chemical mediators generated from both within and outside the gut wall. Some of these receptors are part of a modality specific transduction pathway involved in sensory signalling from the gut lumen to vagal afferent endings in the mucosa. Others, which are activated by substances derived from multiple cellular sources during ischaemia, injury, or inflammation act in a synergistic way to cause acute or chronic sensitisation of the afferent nerves to mechanical and chemical stimuli.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the persistence and permutations of the archetypal road myth. Its main motif is the traveler, who after getting {{in touch with}} the unknown in his wanderings, experiences a mythological and ontological shift. The genealogy of this kind of fables is correlated with spatial transformations of urban and rural America, through the theory of Michel de Certeau about the spatial interpretation of stories. The construction of highways and later on the Interstates network caused immense changes in the landscape, urban and rural forms and social practices. However, the archetypal road myth seems to persist and survive through these changes, adapting in these changes and mutating in the form of myths, screenplays and pulp fiction. Even nowadays, the construction of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>superhighways,</b> which generate a new urban geography, causes a revival of this myth in a totally new context. The main question to be addressed is the work of this story in this transitional social and cultural context: why does it prove recurrent and what role does it play in the formation of social ethics and spatial perception...|$|R

The most important characteristics of the learning environment is the virtual reconstruction of the school space by building virtual places: auditoriums, workshop rooms, cafes, libraries, etc., where students from different locations can meet, interact, and work together, {{as if they were}} face-to-face. The paper aims at developing a model for a Virtual Environment for Distance Education and Training (VEDET) that offers a comprehensive metaphor to be used both for humancomputer interface and instructional design purposes. It also gives a paradigm for restructuring traditional education and training by complementing them with a virtual component. Thus the VEDET would not replace the traditional school, university or training department of a organisation but rather extend their facilities and tools and make their activities more flexible and technologically enriched...|$|R
