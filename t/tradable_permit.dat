In Chile, water pollution is a major problem. Until recently, existing regulations to control water pollution consisted mainly of non-market based instruments. Innovative instruments are now being explored via a recent national law for <b>tradable</b> emission/discharge <b>permits.</b> The instrument of <b>tradable</b> discharge <b>permits</b> {{is one of several}} market-based instruments used in water management and pollution control. <b>Tradable</b> discharge <b>permits</b> are actually among the most challenging market-based instruments in terms of both their design and implementation.

The paper at first introduces <b>tradable</b> <b>permits</b> as part of an overall taxonomy of economic instruments in the field of water management. In this context, three fundamentally different fields of application of <b>tradable</b> <b>permits</b> systems relating to water are presented: tradable water abstraction rights, tradable rights to water-based resources and tradable water pollution rights.

40|$|Market-based {{instruments}} such {{as environmental}} taxes and <b>tradable</b> <b>permit</b> systems {{may be an}} attractive alternative to traditional control-and-command regulation where appropriate, as they allow the polluter the flexibility to comply in a cost-effective manner. In the United Kingdom a <b>tradable</b> <b>permit</b> system, known as the Producer Responsibility Note (PRN) system, {{is being used to}} incentivise recycling activities {{in order to meet the}} targets of the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (94 / 62 /EC). This study examines the possibilities of using a <b>tradable</b> <b>permit</b> system based on the PRN system, but without its legislative backing, in the management of clinical waste. Through a number of interviews with key players in the healthcare, waste management and reprocessing sectors, it aims to assess the feasibility of recycling clinical waste, which has been sterilised by microwave or heat treatment, and of creating an end market for products made from the recyclate. The discussion focuses on issues of segregation of and public perception towards the sterilised waste and explores the influence of these issues on the viability of a <b>tradable</b> <b>permit</b> system for clinical waste. Two approaches of applying a <b>tradable</b> <b>permit</b> system to the recycling of clinical waste are considered, one involving a tight relationship between clinical waste management company and the hospital trust, the other adding the participation of reprocessors to create an open market scenario. The absence of legislative targets for clinical waste management and the uncertainty of an end market for the recyclate necessitate incentivisation of such a system possibly through a government fund, which may undermine the critical factor of reducing the cost of compliance inherent to a <b>tradable</b> <b>permit</b> system. The conclusion emphasises that recycling of sterilised clinical waste is difficult to justify environmentally or financially unless an end market for the recyclate is assured...|$|E
40|$|Scholars often {{attribute}} {{deterioration in}} common-pool resources (CPRs) to ill-defined {{property rights and}} suggest privatization and <b>tradable</b> <b>permit</b> markets {{as a solution to}} the commons problem.

This paper examines factors that contribute to a well-performing <b>tradable</b> <b>permit</b> market. While the literature offers rich empirical analyses of individual <b>tradable</b> <b>permit</b> markets, it has not provided an analytical framework enabling comparative analysis of these markets. This paper develops and employs an analytical framework for comparing across markets. The comparative analysis of market performance suggests that markets are not successful in all environmental problems and all demand situations. Further, it shows that even some markets frequently cited as exemplary successes have been that for nonmarket-related reasons. On the other hand, this comparative analysis identifies sources of success for markets that partial analytical frameworks would have predicted to fail.

40|$|In {{the current}} {{absence of the}} federal government’s strong {{leadership}} to address climate change in the United States, mandatory regional <b>tradable</b> <b>permit</b> programs for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions are being planned by several state governments. A carbon offset program, combined with a <b>tradable</b> <b>permit</b> program, induces {{a wider range of}} entities to implement offset projects that reduce GHG emissions within a wider range of industries than the industries regulated by the <b>tradable</b> <b>permit</b> program. An offset project has to be additional, meaning that it generates emission reductions as compared to the baseline emissions. Therefore, the additionality assessment is the most important element of a carbon offset program, but it is complicated because it requires estimating a counterfactual baseline scenario. For a carbon offset program in the United States, energy efficiency projects to reduce GHG emissions on the demand-side of energy are important. However, energy efficiency projects are prevented from being undertaken due to the high transaction costs of the project-specific additionality assessment method adopted by the Clean Development Mechanism.

40|$|Environmental {{economists have}} shown that {{tradable}} emission permit markets can reduce the costs to society of pollution reduction.

In this paper, we estimate the extent to which social welfare could be improved by using new technology to increase the accuracy with which pollution flows from agricultural fields can be monitored. We use a hypothetical case study of a situation in which farmers can reduce nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from Midwest agricultural land parcels and sell the resulting offset permits in a greenhouse gas <b>tradable</b> <b>permit</b> market. We simulate market outcomes with and without an inexpensive technology that increases the accuracy of emission estimates, reduces the discount to which agricultural offset permits are subject, and improves the performance of <b>tradable</b> <b>permit</b> system.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of a <b>tradable</b> <b>permit</b> market requires the regulator to select a level of aggregate emissions and then distribute the associated permits (rent) to specific groups. In most circumstances, these decisions are often politically contentious and frequently influenced by rent seeking behaviour. In this paper, we use a contest model to analyse the effects of rent seeking effort when permits are freely distributed (grandfathered). Rent seeking behaviour can influence both the share of permits which an individual firm receives and also the total supply of permits. This latter impact depends on the responsiveness of the regulator to aggregate rent seeking effort. Using a three-stage game, we show that rent seeking can influence both the distribution of rents and the ex post value of these rents, whilst welfare usually decreases in the responsiveness of the regulator. <b>tradable</b> <b>permit</b> market, rent seeking, initial allocation...|$|E

40|$|A great {{challenge}} facing future agricultural water {{policy is to}} explore the potential for transition from the current myopic competitive (common) exploitation of groundwater resources to a long-term efficient and sustainable allocation. A number of economic and/or command and control instruments {{can be used by}} the relevant water authority {{in order to deal with}} the economic and environmental problems generated by competitive exploitation. However, according to previous experience in both developed and developing countries, tradable permits seem as one of the most effective and efficient instruments, especially under conditions of limited water availability. On this account, the aim of the current study is to explore the feasibility and implementation of a <b>tradable</b> <b>permit</b> system in irrigated agriculture. To this end, two distinct optimization models are applied and compared: (a) an individual farmer’s model (representing the myopic non-cooperative exploitation of groundwater) and (b) a social planner’s model (representing the cooperative and sustainable allocation). The deviation of their results shows the rationale for using a <b>tradable</b> <b>permit</b> system, while the final allocation of the social planner’s model, solved as an optimal control problem that maximizes the social welfare under specific water policy objectives, denotes the equilibrium state of this system. The two models are then applied in a typical rural area of Greece where groundwater is the only source of irrigated agriculture.
