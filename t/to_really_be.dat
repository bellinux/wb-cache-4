5|$|The {{scenes in}} Chicago were mostly shot on location, as Bay {{believed}} the plates had <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> {{shot in the}} actual city. Farrar was always fascinated {{with the idea of}} shooting on location, and then blending the film with computer-generated imagery. The visual effects team used aerial plates of the city's actual buildings and added destruction elements such as smoke, fire, debris, fighter planes, war, battles, and torn up streets. Four ILM employees also travelled to Chicago and photographed buildings from top to bottom at six different times of the day {{in order to create a}} digital model of the city to be used in certain scenes. ILM's crew designed many major action scenes, with many of the Chicago battle concepts coming from the helicopter shooting of the aerial plates.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} {{called for}} the French and British to abandon the Antwerp–Namur line and strong positions in favour of improvised positions behind the Scheldt, without facing any real resistance. In the South, General Deffontaine of the Belgian VII Corps retreated from the Namur and Liège regions, the Liège fortress region put up stiff resistance to the German 6th Army. In the North, the 7th Army was diverted to Antwerp after the surrender of the Dutch on 15 May, but was then diverted to support the French 1st Army. In the centre, the Belgian Army and the BEF suffered little German pressure. On 15 May, the only sector <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> tested was around Leuven, which was held by the British 3rd Division. The BEF was not pursued vigorously to the Scheldt.|$|E

25|$|Rashi {{expressed}} {{the opinion that}} the reference to mother's milk must exclude fowl from the regulation, since only mammals produce milk. According to Shabbethai Bass, Rashi was expressing the opinion that the reference to a mother was only present to ensure that birds were clearly excluded from the prohibition; Bass argued that Rashi regarded the ban on boiling meat in its mother's milk <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> a more general ban on boiling meat in milk, regardless {{of the relationship between}} the source of the meat and that of the milk.|$|E

They have plans for films, and we have plans to intermingle with them, and it's the name of our show. The second to last episode is called [...] "Ragtag", and that's a term we've used; we wanted to create this ragtag group, but within this giant organization with billions of dollars and support all over the globe and satellite feeds on their luxurious plane.

500|$|Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was {{considered}} the key player for the Virginia Tech offense heading into the Gator Bowl. The younger brother of first-overall NFL Draft pick Michael Vick—who also played for Tech—Marcus {{led the league in}} passing efficiency (141.6rating), completed 166 of 268passes (60.3percent) for 2,190yards and 15touchdowns, with ten interceptions. On the ground, he ran for 370yards and six touchdowns. Prior to the Gator Bowl, he pledged that he would return for another season at Virginia Tech before entering the NFL draft. [...] "The NFL is tough. It's the real deal. You've got to be ready for it. You just don't want to rush into just throwing yourself out there because of the money or anything like that.

500|$|At {{the end of}} , a man {{identifying}} {{himself as}} [...] "Redfield" [...] arrives to rescue Ethan Winters. While the credits refer to the character as Chris Redfield, the helicopter he arrives in is branded with the Umbrella Corporation logo, which is now blue instead of red, initially causing people to question the person's identity, but it was revealed <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> Chris, {{in spite of the}} noticeable change in his appearance due to a different actor portraying him. Chris will appear in the downloadable content campaign, Not a Hero, which was due to be released in early 2017, but has been indefinitely delayed. This sub-chapter will focus on Chris and his comrades attempting to apprehend Lucas Baker, shortly after rescuing Ethan Winters, but many of his men are caught by Lucas, forcing Chris to save them. Chris receives information via radio, from a woman called Veronica (not related to the Veronica mentioned throughout Resident Evil: Code Veronica) as he ventures through salt mines that are filled with monsters, toxic gas and Lucas' traps.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, supervising {{animator}} on {{the film}} Scott Clark, spoke about the challenges of animating car characters, saying: [...] "Getting {{a full range of}} performance and emotion from these characters and making them still seem like cars was a tough assignment, but that's what animation does best. You use your imagination, and you make the movements and gestures fit with the design. Our car characters may not have arms and legs, but we can lean the tires in or out to suggest hands opening up or closing in. We can use steering to point a certain direction. We also designed a special eyelid and an eyebrow for the windshield that lets us communicate an expressiveness that cars don't have." [...] Doug Sweetland, who also served as supervising animator, also spoke about the challenges, saying: [...] "It took a different kind of animator <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> able to interpret the Cars models, than it did to interpret something like The Incredibles models. With The Incredibles, the animator could get reference for the characters by shooting himself and watching the footage. But with Cars, it departs completely from any reference. Yes they're cars, but no car can do what our characters do. It's pure fantasy. It took a lot of trial and error to get them to look right." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Welcome to the Occupation" [...] {{is about}} a teacher limited with his career who strives to be an artist. Willett was {{inspired}} by his job as an English high school teacher in Torrance to write the song, saying that it didn't give him [...] "a lot of creative space <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> very inspired to be a teacher." [...] "Golden Gate Jumpers" [...] {{is about a}} woman who goes to the Golden Gate Bridge and contemplates taking her life away. The tracks [...] "Avalanche in B" [...] and [...] "I've Seen Enough" [...] were originally conceived by the band as one-long track but instead cut into two songs. The former uses snow as a metaphor for how bleak and empty life is when it is coming straight towards you. The latter was created during a jam session in which the band played one continuous chord progression that stuck with them throughout the session. [...] "Every Man I Fall For" [...] is about a woman's perspective on relationships. Inspired by his own mother's relationship with men, Willett saw something he could craft from that emotion, saying that it stuck with him as having importance [...] "because it was something I always saw in relationships; like my mom being a single mother and seeing how men treat these women and how they operate in relationships." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nash's {{screenplay}} changed {{virtually all}} of the sung recitative to spoken dialogue, as in the 1942 stage revival.

In the film the line is spoken. The recitatives themselves did not have <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> rewritten, because they do not rhyme, while the words in all the songs do.|$|E
