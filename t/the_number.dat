5|$|For a {{time after}} the fourth night, Robert cannot find <b>the</b> <b>Number</b> Devil in his dreams; later, however, on the fifth night, Robert finds himself at a desert where <b>the</b> <b>Number</b> Devil teaches him about {{triangular}} numbers {{through the use of}} coconuts. On the sixth night, <b>the</b> <b>Number</b> Devil teaches Robert about the natural occurrence of Fibonacci numbers, which <b>the</b> <b>Number</b> Devil shortens to Bonacci numbers, by counting brown and white rabbits as they reproduce multiple times. By this dream, Robert's mother has noticed a visible change in Robert's mathematical interest, and Robert begins going to sleep earlier to encounter <b>the</b> <b>Number</b> Devil. The seventh night brings Robert to a bare, white room, where <b>the</b> <b>Number</b> Devil presents Pascal's triangle and the patterns that the triangular array displays. On the eighth night, Robert is brought to his classroom at school. <b>The</b> <b>Number</b> Devil arranges Robert's classmates in multiple ways, teaches him about permutations, and what <b>the</b> <b>Number</b> Devil calls vroom numbers (factorials).|$|E
5|$|For {{the letter}} experiment, they asked 219 Japanese {{undergraduate}} students to rate {{each of the}} 45 hiragana, part of the Japanese writing system, according to how much they liked it.
