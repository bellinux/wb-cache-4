5|$|The story {{contains}} {{a number of}} elements that Hergé had already utilized in earlier comics <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> of Tim the Squirrel out West (1931) and <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> of Tom and Millie (1933). He prevented its republication during the German occupation of Belgium, and it was colourised and republished in 1948 in Tintin magazine. Casterman first published it in a collected album in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Although The Castafiore Emerald {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} for making its characters follow a lead of false trails, {{it was not}} a commercial success due to the experimental nature of its narrative. It was published as a book by Casterman shortly after its conclusion. Hergé continued <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> of Tintin with Flight 714 to Sydney, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The story was adapted for the 1991 animated series <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, {{after the end}} of the Second World War, Hergé was {{continuing}} to produce new instalments of <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> of Tintin for the Belgian magazine Tintin, of which he was the artistic director. After completing serialisation of Prisoners of the Sun in April 1949, he ordered his staff to re-serialise one of his old stories, Popol and Virginia, while he took a three-month break. At this point, Hergé was depressed and suffering from a range of physical ailments, including boils and eczema on his hands. Although fed up with <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> of Tintin, he felt great pressure on him to continue producing the series for Tintin magazine.|$|E

5|$|Eight {{years after}} Hergé's death, Tintin in Tibet was adapted into {{an episode of}} <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> of Tintin (1991–92), a {{television}} series by French studio Ellipse and Canadian animation company Nelvana.

5|$|Following the {{publication}} of Tintin in the Congo, Hergé conducted research for a story set in the United States, desiring to reflect his concerns regarding the treatment of Native communities by the U.S. government. Bolstered by a publicity stunt, Tintin in America was a commercial success in Belgium and was soon republished in France. Hergé continued <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> of Tintin with Cigars of the Pharaoh, and the series became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1945, Tintin in America was re-drawn and coloured in Hergé's ligne-claire style for republication by Casterman, with further alterations made {{at the request of}} his American publisher for a 1973 edition. The story was adapted for a 1991 episode of the Ellipse/Nelvana animated series <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> of Tintin. Critical reception of the work has been mixed, with commentators on <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> of Tintin arguing that although it represents an improvement on the preceding two instalments, it still reflects many of the problems that were visible in them.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, Hergé became {{increasingly}} annoyed at {{the success of}} René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo's Asterix comic book series, which various commentators had described as eclipsing <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> of Tintin as the foremost comic in the Franco-Belgian tradition. Hoping to imitate {{the success of the}} recent animated films Asterix the Gaul (1967) and Asterix and Cleopatra (1968), Hergé agreed to the production of two animated Belvision films based on <b>the</b> <b>Adventures</b> of Tintin. The first, Tintin and the Temple of the Sun (1969), was based on pre-existing comics, whereas the second, Tintin and the Lake of Sharks (1972) was an original story written by Greg. In 1982 the American filmmaker Steven Spielberg requested the film rights for a live-action adaptation of one of <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> of Tintin, a prospect that excited Hergé, but the project never came to fruition at the time.|$|E
