5|$|The middle {{decades of}} the 20th century saw the rise of {{molecular}} biology, and with it {{an understanding of the}} chemical nature of genes as sequences of DNA and of their relationship—through the genetic code—to protein sequences. At the same time, increasingly powerful techniques for analyzing proteins, such as protein electrophoresis and sequencing, brought biochemical phenomena into realm of the synthetic theory of evolution. In the early 1960s, biochemists Linus Pauling and Emile Zuckerkandl proposed <b>the</b> <b>molecular</b> clock hypothesis (MCH): that sequence differences between homologous proteins could be used to calculate the time since two species diverged. By 1969, Motoo Kimura and others provided a theoretical basis for <b>the</b> <b>molecular</b> clock, arguing that—at <b>the</b> <b>molecular</b> level at least—most genetic mutations are neither harmful nor helpful and that mutation and genetic drift (rather than natural selection) cause a large portion of genetic change: the neutral theory of molecular evolution. Studies of protein differences within species also brought molecular data to bear on population genetics by providing estimates of the level of heterozygosity in natural populations.|$|E

40|$|Virus-induced soluble antigens {{produced}} in mammalian cells after infection with vaccinia virus {{can be divided}} into two classes on <b>the</b> basis of <b>molecular</b> weight.

A portion of <b>the</b> low <b>molecular</b> weight antigens appear to be incorporated into the structure of newly synthesized virus, probably as internal proteins. In contrast, synthesis of <b>the</b> high <b>molecular</b> weight antigen class is initiated later in the course of infection (4 to 5 hr), just prior to the appearance of newly synthesized virus.
