40|$|With {{increasing}} urbanization, {{the populations}} in China’s cities are growing, and the cities themselves are gradually expanding. Competition {{for access to}} <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>territory’s</b> resources is also growing. Thus, <b>the</b> quality of <b>national</b> <b>territory</b> use is worsening. Quality assessments on <b>national</b> <b>territory</b> use can {{provide a basis for}} solving this issue. By combining the implications of new urbanization in China, we established an assessment index system relating to <b>the</b> quality of <b>national</b> <b>territory</b> use, from <b>the</b> perspective of harmoniously developing spaces for production, living and ecology. A subjective and objective integrated weighting method was developed based on principal component analysis and planning review. Then, a comprehensive discriminative model was established to assess <b>the</b> quality of <b>national</b> <b>territory</b> use. <b>The</b> evaluation results showed that harmonious development of spaces for production, living and ecology did not occur in either the ecology-oriented or production-oriented regions. The integrated quality of <b>national</b> <b>territory</b> use in <b>the</b> production-oriented region had a significant advantage over that of the ecology-oriented region. The integrated quality of <b>national</b> <b>territory</b> use was highest in Changzhou’s city center and vicinity. The results can support the implementation of China’s new urbanization strategy and provide evidence to improve the criteria for the intensive use of national territorial resources...|$|R
