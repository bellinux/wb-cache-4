40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] In case centred {{epidemiological}} studies, <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> {{has been}} shown to be a potent risk factor for child pedestrian injuries. Nevertheless, over the past two decades child pedestrian death rates have fallen in many countries despite large increases in <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes,</b> suggesting that other factors are responsible for the long term decline in death rates. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between short term changes in <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> and child pedestrian death rates. DESIGN [...] The relationship between child pedestrian death rates and <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> in the USA for the period 1970 - 88 was investigated. Trends in death rates and in <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> were removed by the time series method of differencing. RESULTS [...] After removing the long term trends, there was a close relationship between the year to year variation in <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> and the year to year variation in the child pedestrian death rate. Most notably, in the two periods when <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> actually fell, the falls in the child pedestrian death rate were considerably larger than those seen at any other time. Overall, decelerations in the rate of increase in <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> were accompanied by accelerations in the rate of decline in the child pedestrian death rate. CONCLUSION [...] While other factors may determine long term trends in child pedestrian death rates, they are very sensitive to short term changes in <b>traffic</b> <b>volume.</b> Public policy changes which limit the growth in <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> have the potential to accelerate the decline in child pedestrian death rates...|$|R

40|$|Roads, while {{central to}} the {{function}} of human society, create barriers to animal movement through collisions and habitat fragmentation. Barriers to animal movement affect the evolution and trajectory of populations. Investigators have attempted to use <b>traffic</b> <b>volume,</b> the number of vehicles passing a point on a road segment, to predict effects to wildlife populations approximately linearly and along taxonomic lines; however, taxonomic groupings cannot provide sound predictions because closely related species often respond differently. We assess the role of wildlife behavioral responses to <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> {{as a tool to}} predict barrier effects from vehicle-caused mortality and avoidance, to provide an early warning system that recognizes <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> as a trigger for mitigation, and to better interpret roadkill data. We propose four categories of behavioral response based on the perceived danger to traffic: Nonresponders, Pausers, Speeders, and Avoiders. Nonresponders attempt to cross highways regardless of <b>traffic</b> <b>volume.</b> Pausers stop in the face of danger so have a low probability of successful crossing when <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> increases. Hence, highway barrier effects are primarily due to mortality for Nonresponders and Pausers at high <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes.</b> Speeders run away from danger but are unable to do so successfully as <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> increases. At moderate to high volume, Speeders are repelled by traffic danger. Avoiders face lower mortality than other categories because they begin to avoid traffic at relatively low <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes.</b> Hence, avoidance causes barrier effects more than mortality for Speeders and Avoiders even at relatively moderate <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes.</b> By considering a species’ risk-avoidance response to traffic, managers can make more appropriate and timely decisions to mitigate effects before populations decline or become locally extinct...|$|R

40|$|On motorways, {{congestion}} is {{a well-known}} traffic problem. On the secondary road network, the same problem arises when <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> increases and the driven speed decreases. At certain times of day, roads get congested {{and the number of}} interactions between road users increases. In general, higher <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes</b> and congestion affect road safety. But how and to what extent does this happen? This study aims to gain more insight into the relationship between <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> and road safety and is limited to road sections and intersections on 80 km/h roads in the Netherlands. The two most common types of intersections - roundabouts and signalised intersections - are discussed in the present study. A literature review is carried out to investigate the relationship between <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> and road safety on secondary rural roads (mainly 80 km/h distributor roads).

The larger this parameter value is, the more likely the network device should stay at the current cluster. On the contrary, the smaller it is, the more aggressively the network device should change the cluster that it belongs to.

This value is closely related to the activity, which is equivalent to the satisfactory degree of cluster selection. Therefore, this activity indicates the ratio of user <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> against signaling <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> for the path setup, which corresponds to high probability to alleviate frequent handovers.
