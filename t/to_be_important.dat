From US131 east to the eastern terminus at US23, M-32 is listed on the National Highway System (NHS), a group of highways which are determined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. The exception is a portion in eastern Otsego and western Montmorency counties, between the corner of Beckett & Turtle Lake Roads, six miles (10km) east of Gaylord to the crossroads known as Big Rock, five miles (8km) west of Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|Among whites, gender nonconformity {{appeared}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> in {{the development}} of homosexuality among masculine homosexual women, but not among homosexual women who were not masculine, while adolescent homosexual involvement was important for non-masculine homosexual women but not masculine homosexual women. Bisexual women appeared to be more influenced by involvement in homosexual genital activities in childhood than exclusively homosexual women, but unlike exclusively homosexual women, their homosexual preference did not appear related to inability to experience heterosexual arousal in childhood. Childhood gender nonconformity appeared more significant for exclusively homosexual women than for bisexual women, and more significant for women who had been in psychotherapy than for women who had not.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds {{are common}} {{components}} of the avifauna of {{some parts of the}} Neotropics and are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> in some ecological processes. They are preyed upon by birds of prey, and their tendency to join flocks is thought to provide protection against such predation. The greater round-eared bat preys on some antbird species, such as the white-bibbed antbird and the scaled antbird; the latter is the bat's preferred prey. Nests, including incubating adults, chicks and eggs, are vulnerable to predators, particularly snakes but also nocturnal mammals. Nesting success is low for many species, particularly in areas of fragmented habitat.|$|E

5|$|Approach-avoidance {{conflict}} {{happens when}} a situation is presented that can either be rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making {{has been associated with}} anxiety. fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall findings showed that the anterior hippocampus is sensitive to conflict, and that it may be part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> in decision making in uncertain conditions.|$|E

The trial and evaluation of the product prior to purchase and dealer's expert installation are considered by Linn <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> parts of the value added of their top-end products. As such, no instructions were supplied with the product. The Isobaric PMS retailed at £2,400 including stands in May 1991, and the 4-ohm crossover was priced at just under £500.|$|E

He considered the musical accompaniment of a film <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>important,</b> and from A Woman of Paris onwards he took an increasing interest in this area. With the advent of sound technology, Chaplin began using a synchronised orchestral soundtrack – composed by himself – for City Lights (1931). He thereafter composed the scores for all of his films, and from the late 1950s to his death, he scored all of his silent features and some of his short films.|$|E

5|$|Chapter 3 is short, {{and opens}} {{with a list of}} eight asanas (postures), {{followed}} by the description of each one. The asanas are of two types: one set is for meditative contemplation, and the other for cleansing the body. Both are said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> in the journey of yoga. Different asanas focus on different organ groups. Of the eight asanas, the text discusses two variations each for the Swastikasana and the Mukta Sirsasana in verses 3.3–5 and 3.13–14 respectively, with claims that each asana helps cleanse the body when these are practiced with Yamas and Niyamas.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, the (2,0)-theory {{has proven}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> for {{studying}} the general properties of quantum field theories. Indeed, this theory subsumes many mathematically interesting effective quantum field theories and points to new dualities relating these theories. For example, Luis Alday, Davide Gaiotto, and Yuji Tachikawa showed that by compactifying this theory on a surface, one obtains a four-dimensional quantum field theory, {{and there is a}} duality known as the AGT correspondence which relates the physics of this theory to certain physical concepts associated with the surface itself. More recently, theorists have extended these ideas to study the theories obtained by compactifying down to three dimensions.|$|E

More specifically, macroeconomic stability {{in terms of a}} low inflation rate, efficient markets in terms of institutions, trade openness, GDP per capita and better infrastructure <b>are</b> <b>important</b> determinants of FDI. Governments in developing countries can significantly promote FDI by introducing appropriate institutional reforms and macroeconomic policies.|$|R

When vision (and hence the use of remembered landmarks) is not available, such as when animals are navigating on a cloudy night, in the open ocean, or in relatively featureless areas such as sandy deserts, path integration must rely on idiothetic cues from within the body.|$|E

In {{the early days of the}} investigation, the direction in which he was walking was thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>important,</b> because he was moving toward the home of Robert Murat, the 33-year-old British-Portuguese man who lived near apartment 5A, and who became the case's first arguido.|$|E
5|$|Television in Croatia, as {{all other}} {{media in the}} country are criticised for lack of balance of global issues and trends on one hand and {{national}} topics covered on the other. All major television networks in Croatia are generally thought to be under excessive influence of commercialism.

The television in Croatia is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> in avenue for non-governmental organizations communicating their concerns to the public and to criticising the authorities.

5|$|Tires {{generate}} the lateral forces necessary for steering and balance {{through a combination}} of cornering force and camber thrust. Tire inflation pressures have also been found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> variables in the behavior of a motorcycle at high speeds. Because the front and rear tires can have different slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. Of the two, understeer, in which the front wheel slides more than the rear wheel, is more dangerous since front wheel steering is critical for maintaining balance.|$|E
