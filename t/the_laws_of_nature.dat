5|$|<b>The</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> {{were long}} thought {{to remain the}} same under mirror reflection. The results of an {{experiment}} viewed via a mirror {{were expected to be}} identical to the results of a mirror-reflected copy of the experimental apparatus. This so-called law of parity conservation was known to be respected by classical gravitation, electromagnetism and the strong interaction; it was assumed to be a universal law. However, in the mid-1950s Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee suggested that the weak interaction might violate this law. Chien Shiung Wu and collaborators in 1957 discovered that the weak interaction violates parity, earning Yang and Lee the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E

Strange progresses quickly, and secretly reads the text from which Kaecilius stole pages, learning to bend time with the mystical Eye of Agamotto.

25|$|Causal determinism: The {{idea that}} {{everything}} is caused by prior conditions, {{making it impossible for}} anything else to happen. In its most common form, nomological (or scientific) determinism, future events are necessitated by past and present events combined with <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> Such determinism is sometimes illustrated by the thought experiment of Laplace's demon. Imagine an entity that knows all facts about the past and the present, and knows all natural laws that govern the universe. If <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> were determinate, then such an entity would be able to use this knowledge to foresee the future, down to the smallest detail.|$|E

50|$|Natural <b>law</b> or <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> {{refers to}} {{normative}} properties that are inherent by virtue <b>of</b> human <b>nature,</b> and universally cognizable through human reason. Historically, natural <b>law</b> refers to <b>the</b> use of reason to analyze both social and personal {{human nature to}} deduce binding rules <b>of</b> moral behavior. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> being determined by nature, is universal.|$|R

25|$|A third {{argument}} for incompatibilism was formulated by Carl Ginet in the 1960s and has received much {{attention in the}} modern literature. The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we {{have no control over}} {{the events of the past}} that determined our present state and no control over <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> Since we can have no control over these matters, we also can have no control over the consequences of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> then we have no control over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the consequence argument. Peter van Inwagen remarks that C. D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.|$|E

25|$|A {{collider}} {{is a type}} of {{a particle}} accelerator with two directed beams of particles. In particle physics, colliders are used as a research tool: they accelerate particles to very high kinetic energies and let them impact other particles. Analysis of the byproducts of these collisions gives scientists good evidence {{of the structure of the}} subatomic world and <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> governing it. Many of these byproducts are produced only by high-energy collisions, and they decay after very short periods of time. Thus many of them are hard or nearly impossible to study in other ways.|$|E
25|$|According to Kant, {{we think}} of {{ourselves}} as having free will. This lets us make judgments such as “you ought to have done that thing that you did not do.” Kant argues that this notion of freedom cannot be derived from our experience. We can be sure that this concept of freedom doesn't come from experience because experience itself contradicts it. Our experience is of everything in the sensible world and in the sensible world, everything that happens does so in accord with <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> and {{there is no room for}} a free will to influence events.|$|E
25|$|Reward and punishment, {{supplemented}} by future retribution, are, in his view, the sanctions of <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> {{the sources of}} our obligation to obey them. To the other great ethical question, How are moral distinctions apprehended?, he replies that it is by means of right reason. But by right reason he means merely the power of rising to general laws of nature from particular facts of experience. It is no peculiar faculty or distinctive function of mind; it involves no original element of cognition; it begins with sense and experience; it is gradually generated and wholly derivative.|$|E

25|$|Edwards {{was fascinated}} by the discoveries of Isaac Newton and other {{scientists}} of his age. Before he undertook full-time ministry work in Northampton, he wrote on various topics in natural philosophy, including flying spiders, light and optics. While he was worried about the materialism and faith in reason alone of some of his contemporaries, he saw <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> as derived from God and demonstrating his wisdom and care. Edwards also wrote sermons and theological treatises that emphasized the beauty of God and the role of aesthetics in the spiritual life, in which he anticipates a 20th-century current of theological aesthetics, represented by figures like Hans Urs von Balthasar.|$|E
25|$|The way Kant {{suggests}} that we should deal with this dialectic is through {{an appeal to the}} two perspectives we can take on ourselves. This is the same sort of move he made earlier in this section. On one perspective, the perspective of the world of understanding, we are free, whereas from the other, the perspective of the world of the senses or appearances, natural laws determine everything that happens. There is no contradiction because the claim to freedom applies to one world, and the claim of <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> determining everything applies to the other. The claims do not conflict because they have different targets.|$|E
25|$|However, Poincaré's {{resolution}} led to {{a paradox}} when changing frames: if a Hertzian oscillator radiates in a certain direction, it will suffer a recoil from the inertia of the fictitious fluid. Poincaré performed a Lorentz boost (to order v/c) to {{the frame of the}} moving source. He noted that energy conservation holds in both frames, but that the law of conservation of momentum is violated. This would allow perpetual motion, a notion which he abhorred. <b>The</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> would have to be different in the frames of reference, and the relativity principle would not hold. Therefore, he argued that also in this case there has to be another compensating mechanism in the ether.|$|E

25|$|Angels {{take the}} role of {{intermediaries}} performing different tasks of God. They are often associated with abstract concepts, specific phenomena, carrying <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> and can also appear personified. Due to hadith tradition, angels are generally said to be created out of light, although several traditions assume exceptions including angels created from fire or ice. For example, based on a tradition from Ibn Abbas, Azazil was an angel created from fire or even from a whole tribe of angels, created from fire. Some scholars like Al-Baydawi explained, fire and light are akin, thus it both delineate a luminous origin of angels. Others suggested {{a distinction between the}} angels of mercy, created from light and angels of punishment, created from fire.|$|E
25|$|When the 23-year-old Albert Einstein {{started the}} Olympia Academy study group in 1902, {{with his two}} younger friends, Maurice Solovine and Conrad Habicht, his first reading {{suggestion}} was Pearson's The Grammar of Science. This book covered several themes that were later {{to become part of}} the theories of Einstein and other scientists. Pearson asserted that <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> are relative to the perceptive ability of the observer. Irreversibility of natural processes, he claimed, is a purely relative conception. An observer who travels at the exact velocity of light would see an eternal now, or an absence of motion. He speculated that an observer who travelled faster than light would see time reversal, similar to a cinema film being run backwards. Pearson also discussed antimatter, the fourth dimension, and wrinkles in time.|$|E
25|$|The work of Lorentz was mathematically perfected by Henri Poincaré who {{formulated}} on {{many occasions}} the Principle of Relativity and tried to harmonize it with electrodynamics. He declared simultaneity only a convenient convention which depends on the speed of light, whereby the constancy {{of the speed of}} light would be a useful postulate for making <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> as simple as possible. In 1900 and 1904 he physically interpreted Lorentz's local time as the result of clock synchronization by light signals. And finally in June and July 1905 he declared the relativity principle a general law of nature, including gravitation. He corrected some mistakes of Lorentz and proved the Lorentz covariance of the electromagnetic equations. However, he used the notion of an aether as a perfectly undetectable medium and distinguished between apparent and real time, so most historians of science argue that he failed to invent special relativity.|$|E
60|$|For {{though it}} is true that <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> is common to all, and that all men are to this day under the power and command thereof; yet we find not that they are by nature under the {{conviction}} of the necessity of keeping of a seventh day sabbath.
