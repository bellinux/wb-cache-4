5|$|According to Thompson, the Navy {{immediately}} began efforts {{to cover up}} the cause of the explosion. Rear Admiral Richard Milligan, assigned to lead the investigation, soon focused his inquiry into <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> one of the deceased turret's crewmembers, Clayton Hartwig, had intentionally caused the explosion. After learning that Hartwig had named another sailor and friend, Kendall Truitt, as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy on himself, Milligan enlisted the help of the Naval Investigative Service (NIS) (the predecessor of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service or NCIS) to investigate Hartwig and Truitt.|$|E
25|$|Note that Opel prices {{appear to}} be {{inherently}} higher than Ford ones. A common mistake {{in a lot of}} examples <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> VAT rebates form as a trade barrier is, to set retail prices equal for both Ford and Opel. This way, prices are initially equal, but become different after all the additional VAT taxes and rebates described below. Such an approach {{does not take into account}} the simple fact that Opel prices in the table above always include VAT while Ford prices never include it. That's exactly why additional adjustments are made in VAT taxation.|$|E
25|$|The {{age of the}} Swedish-speaking {{population}} in the territory that today constitutes Finland was a subject of fierce debate in the early 20th century {{as a part of}} the Finland's language strife. Some Finland-Swede scholars like Ralf Saxén, Knut Hugo Pipping and Tor Karsten used place names <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> the Swedish settlement in Finland dates back to prehistoric times. Their views where opposed mainly by Heikki Ojansuu in the 1920s. In 1966, the historian Hämäläinen (as referenced by McRae 1993) addressed the strong correlation between the scholar's mother-tongue and the views on the age and continuity of the Scandinavian settlement history of Finland.|$|E

25|$|The American lawyers’ {{argument}} can be summarized as <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> “invisible injury” occurred in the region. Large sums of money rested {{on the results of}} this case as the decision would affect various other smelting projects across North America; as such, the lawyers representing Cominco successfully limited the definition of damage to the actual, observable, economic damage. Lawyers on both sides were well practiced with substantial experience. R.C. “Judge” Crowe, VP of Cominco and a Montreal Corporate Lawyer, and John E. Read represented Cominco. The U.S. hired Jacob G. Metzger, a State Department attorney with experience in negotiating international claims. Metzger had a habit of not writing his arguments down, and when he died in 1937 the American scientists and lawyers went into the hearing unprepared.|$|E
25|$|The society held {{monthly meeting}} to discuss new books, share folklore, deliver presentations, debate on ways to stop Germanization. The {{meetings}} took place not only in Tilsit, but also in Memel (Klaipėda), Coadjuthen (Katyčiai), Kaukehmen (Jasnoje), Ragnit (Neman), Lasdehnen (Krasnoznamensk), Schmalleningken (Smalininkai). The number of attendees grew from a dozen to 300. However, the quality of presentations and discussions was limited by lack of education among Birutė's members, most of whom only had primary education. In {{one of the early}} meetings, Vilius Bruožis, future chairman of the society, spoke for three hours <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> the Lithuanian language was spoken in the Garden of Eden. The society considered and took tentative steps to establish Lithuanian-language schools, publish books (including a history of Lithuania that would incorporate the history of Lithuania Minor), its own newspaper, or calendars, but those plans were not realized. The society considered but rejected the idea of taking over the publication of bankrupt Aušra. Instead, it financially supported (15 marks per month) the short-lived newspaper Garsas published by Jankus. In 1888, the society officially dropped book publication from its goals and reduced the number of meetings to once a quarter. In total, between 1885 and 1888, the society held about 30 meetings.|$|E

He {{spent most of}} his time and money quarrelling with émigré Yugoslav politicians, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> his {{collaboration}} with the Italians was necessary in order to protect the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the Partisans and Germans. He became a member of the Association of Free Journalists of Central-Eastern Europe, and served as an informant for the Italian intelligence services between 1946 and 1947. During this period, he published a confidential periodical called the Royal Yugoslav Intelligence Bulletin which he shared with the Italians. Jevđević also contributed to a number of newspapers, including the Serb nationalist Srbobran. In 1946, he helped form the Serbian National Committee in Rome and, with help from Achille Marazza, published a pan-Serb and anti-Croat newspaper, Srpske Novine, in Eboli. He also established contacts with Italian neo-fascist groups and with an anti-communist group called the Committee of Nations Oppressed by Russia.|$|E
500|$|... "Through the Rain" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics; many complimented Carey's restrained vocal performance, {{as well as}} the song's simple instrumental accompaniment, while others criticized it for being overly-dramatic. Jon Pareles of The New York Times described it as [...] "inspirational", and felt that due to its vagueness, the song is would be applicable to all listeners, not just Carey. The Daily Unions David Germain commented how the song's simple musical arrangement and Carey's [...] "restrained" [...] vocal delivery aided it in becoming [...] "modest and reserved". Writing for Billboard, Michael Paoletta chose [...] "Through the Rain" [...] as a top pick from the album, as did Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine. He described it as a song that was designed as [...] "'Vision of Love' meets 'Hero'", and wrote, [...] "Mariah is back in the adult contemporary camp, no longer <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> she's real." [...] Cara DiPasquale from the Chicago Tribune called it a [...] "powerhouse ballad", while Entertainment Weeklys Tom Sinclair wrote [...] "embellished with her trademark vocal pyrotechnics, it is one of those highly personal songs about finding your way out of an emotional wilderness, but it sinks in its own sodden sentimentality". Similarly, a writer from Newsday also described [...] "Through the Rain" [...] as a [...] "powerhouse ballad", and felt it was reminiscent of Carey's previous single [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] (1995). Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Randy Lewis noted how the song was able to effectively take listeners right into Carey's personal struggles from the previous year. Tina Brown from Newsweek felt that while Carey's personal troubles may not have been fully solved, the song made her appear [...] "strong and triumphant".|$|E

2500|$|A central {{task for}} the pioneers of sign {{language}} linguistics was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> ASL was a real language and not merely a collection of gestures or [...] "English on the hands." [...] One of the prevailing beliefs at this time was that 'real languages' must consist of an arbitrary relationship between form and meaning.

As a result, iconicity as a whole was largely neglected in research of sign languages.|$|E

[...] The poet is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> katharevousa is an artificial language, of no use to either the people nor to literature. [...] The poet supports a literary language based on the language spoken by the people, that should be elaborated on by the poet. [...] In order to support his argument, the following phrase is used: [...] "firstly succumb {{to the language of}} the people and then, if you are worthy, conquer it". His arguments are based on the French Age of Enlightenment {{on the subject of the}} use of national languages and on examples of Italian poetry, by which he tries to prove that no word is vulgar in itself but gets its meaning by the poem's context. [...] At the end of the work, the poet abandons the rational reasoning and supports his arguments with passion.|$|E
2500|$|Pirate Guybrush Threepwood boasts to two pirates {{about the}} time he {{defeated}} LeChuck.

The pirates tell Guybrush that Largo LaGrande, LeChuck's former first mate, has placed an embargo on the island, and is not allowing any ships to enter or leave. Guybrush wanders into Woodtick, the only town on the island, and encounters Largo, who promptly robs him of all of his money and takes off. Wandering the island, Guybrush comes across the International House of Mojo, the Voodoo Lady's new shop. She offers to help him drive Largo off the island if he can get her some ingredients for a voodoo doll. After retrieving the needed ingredients, Guybrush, with the voodoo doll that Voodoo Lady makes for him, defeats Largo. However, in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> {{he was the one who}} killed LeChuck, Guybrush makes the mistake of showing Largo LeChuck's beard, which he had kept as a trophy. Largo then steals the beard and uses it to resurrect his old boss, this time as a zombie. The Voodoo Lady reveals to Guybrush that Big Whoop, the mythical treasure for which he is searching, is also the key to another dimension which will allow him to escape from LeChuck forever. In addition, she gives him a library book about Big Whoop which reveals that a map, made by the original discoverers of the treasure, still exists in four fragments.|$|E
