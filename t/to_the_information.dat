5|$|Communications signals {{can be sent}} {{either by}} analog signals or digital signals. There are analog {{communication}} systems and digital communication systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>information.</b> In a digital signal, the information is encoded {{as a set of}} discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form of noise is called additive noise, with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.|$|E

5|$|The war was {{accompanied}} by a media battle between Russia and Georgia. The Russian military brought Russian journalists to the combat zone to report news discrediting Georgia and portraying Russia as the saviour of Russian citizens in the conflict zone. Russia also aired television footage supporting its actions which had a strong effect on the local populations of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. In a first for Russia, a Russian Armed Forces spokesman was provided by the Russian authorities to give television interviews about the war. Despite these tactics and domestic success, the Russian information campaign against Georgia was not successful internationally. In response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> war, the Georgian government halted the broadcasting of Russian television channels in Georgia and blocked access to Russian websites. The information skirmishes between Georgia and Russia continued after armed hostilities had ended. According to political scientist Svante Cornell, the Kremlin spent millions in an international information campaign to blame Georgia for the war. Cornell writes that there is evidence, including some in Russian media, that Russia actually started the war.|$|E

In particular, {{we focus on}} two routing models: Trusted Group Multicast (TGM) and Con-fidential Unicast (CU). In TGM, a group member shares <b>the</b> <b>information</b> with all other group members; while in CU, a group member may only want <b>to</b> share <b>the</b> <b>information</b> with a few selected group members. In both cases, the sender would like <b>to</b> transmit <b>the</b> <b>information</b> through a route with a minimal probability of being overheard by non-destination users. To achieve this objective, we propose a routing algorithm <b>to</b> re-duce <b>the</b> <b>information</b> leakage. <b>The</b> performance of our design is evaluated through simulation studies. ...|$|R
