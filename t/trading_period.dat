40|$|This paper studies how market {{closures}} affect investors' trading {{policies and}} the resulting return-generating process. It shows that closures generate rich patterns of time variation in trading and returns, including those consistent with empirical findings: (1) U-shaped patterns in the mean and volatility of returns over <b>trading</b> <b>periods,</b> (2) higher <b>trading</b> activity around the close and open, (3) more volatile open-to-open returns than close-to-close returns, (4) higher returns over <b>trading</b> <b>periods</b> than over nontrading periods, (5) more volatile returns over <b>trading</b> <b>periods</b> than over nontrading periods.

For example, a team may include draft picks in future drafts in order to acquire a player during a <b>trading</b> <b>period.</b> Teams may also make negotiations during the draft relinquishing the right to pick in a given round for the right to have an additional pick in a later round. Thus teams may have no picks or multiple picks in a given round.|$|E
25|$|A {{tradable}} credit {{can be an}} emissions allowance or an {{assigned amount}} unit which was originally allocated or auctioned by the national administrators of a Kyoto-compliant cap-and-trade scheme, {{or it can be}} an offset of emissions. Such offsetting and mitigating activities can occur in any developing country which has ratified the Kyoto Protocol, and has a national agreement in place to validate its carbon project through one of the UNFCCC's approved mechanisms. Once approved, these units are termed Certified Emission Reductions, or CERs. The Protocol allows these projects to be constructed and credited in advance of the Kyoto <b>trading</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
25|$|On the NBA's trade {{deadline}} on February 24, 2011, numerous sports news outlets, including ESPN, {{reported that}} the Pacers had agreed to a three-team trade that would have sent Josh McRoberts to the Memphis Grizzlies and Brandon Rush to the New Orleans Hornets, while the Pacers would have received O. J. Mayo from the Grizzlies in return, and the Hornets would have sent an unidentified player to the Grizzlies. However, the <b>trading</b> <b>period</b> expired at 3:00pm EST, and the trade paperwork did not reach the NBA's main offices for approval until 3:02pm. Thus, the trade was canceled and all aforementioned players remained with their original teams.|$|E

25|$|The re-indexing {{problem of}} {{leveraged}} ETFs {{stems from the}} arithmetic effect of volatility of the underlying index. Take, for example, an index that begins at 100 and a 2X fund based on that index that also starts at 100. In a first <b>trading</b> <b>period</b> (for example, a day), the index rises 10% to 110. The 2X fund will then rise 20% to 120. The index then drops back to 100 (a drop of 9.09%), {{so that it is}} now even. The drop in the 2X fund will be 18.18% (2*9.09). But 18.18% of 120 is 21.82. This puts the value of the 2X fund at 98.18. Even though the index is unchanged after two trading periods, an investor in the 2X fund would have lost 1.82%. This decline in value can be even greater for inverse funds (leveraged funds with negative multipliers such as -1, -2, or -3). It always occurs when the change in value of the underlying index changes direction. And the decay in value increases with volatility of the underlying index.|$|E
25|$|After an offseason {{that saw}} All Star {{pitchers}} Gio González, Trevor Cahill, and Andrew Bailey traded away, the A's entered the 2012 season with low expectations. This season was Bob Melvin's first full {{season as the}} A's manager. During the <b>trading</b> <b>period,</b> the A's had traded fan-favorite catcher Kurt Suzuki to the Washington Nationals for cash considerations. The A's also traded relief pitcher Fautino de los Santos to the Milwaukee Brewers for catcher George Kottaras. On August 15, veteran starting pitcher Bartolo Colón received a 50-game suspension after testing positive for performing-enhancing drugs. On September 5, veteran pitcher Brandon McCarthy was struck {{in the head by}} a line drive off of the bat of Erick Aybar ending his 2012 season. The A's entered the last month of the season with an all-rookie starting rotation, {{but by the end of}} the month, they had pulled within 2 games of the Texas Rangers for the AL West lead, setting the stage for a season ending, 3 game series that would decide the winner of the 2012 division title. The A's swept the series, culminating in 12-5 victory which saw the A's come back from a 4 run deficit to clinch the AL West for the first time since 2006. The A's ended the regular season with a record of 94-68, leading the Major Leagues in walk-off wins, with 14 in the regular season, and one in Game 4 of the American League Division Series. The A's lost the ALDS to the eventual American League Champion Detroit Tigers in 5 games.|$|E
2500|$|A {{contract}} for difference (CFD) is a two-way hedge or swap contract that allows the seller and purchaser to fix {{the price of a}} volatile commodity. Consider a deal between an electricity producer and an electricity retailer, both of whom trade through an electricity market pool. If the producer and the retailer agree to a strike price of $50 per MWh, for 1 MWh in a <b>trading</b> <b>period,</b> and if the actual pool price is $70, then the producer gets $70 from the pool but has to rebate $20 (the [...] "difference" [...] between the strike price and the pool price) to the retailer.|$|E

2500|$|The {{regulation}} {{contains two}} key components: the [...] "locate" [...] and the [...] "close-out." [...] The locate component attempts to reduce failure to deliver securities by requiring a broker possess or have arranged to possess borrowed shares. The close out component requires that a broker {{be able to}} deliver the shares that are to be shorted. In the US, initial public offers (IPOs) cannot be sold short for a month after they start trading. This mechanism is in place to ensure a degree of price stability during a company's initial <b>trading</b> <b>period.</b> However, some brokerage firms that specialize in penny stocks (referred to colloquially as bucket shops) have used the lack of short selling during this month to pump and dump thinly traded IPOs. Canada and other countries do allow selling IPOs (including U.S. IPOs) short.|$|E
2500|$|The Kyoto {{mechanism}} {{is the only}} internationally agreed mechanism for regulating carbon credit activities, [...] and, crucially, includes checks for additionality and overall effectiveness. Its supporting organisation, the UNFCCC, is the only organisation with a global mandate on the overall effectiveness of emission control systems, although enforcement of decisions relies on national co-operation. The Kyoto <b>trading</b> <b>period</b> only applies for five years between 2008 and 2012. The {{first phase of the}} EU ETS system started before then, and is expected to continue in a third phase afterwards, and may co-ordinate with whatever is internationally agreed at but there is general uncertainty as to what will be agreed in Post–Kyoto Protocol negotiations on greenhouse gas emissions. As business investment often operates over decades, this adds risk and uncertainty to their plans. As several countries responsible for a large proportion of global emissions (notably USA, India, China) have avoided mandatory caps, this also means that businesses in capped countries may perceive themselves to be working at a competitive disadvantage against those in uncapped countries as they are now paying for their carbon costs directly.|$|E
