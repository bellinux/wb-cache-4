Several theories have sought to explain the demise of the Mary Rose, based on historical records, knowledge of 16th-century shipbuilding, and modern experiments.

However, not all customers are profitable. To keep profitable customers is not an easy process, especially in today&# 039;s business environment where competition is fierce. Relationship management is a way of managing the relationships between a company and its customers. The importance of long-term relationships for a business has repeatedly pointed out by many researchers during the 1990 s, who advised that companies need to consider the lifetime value of their customers and to develop strategies for managing customer satisfaction and loyalty in relationships.
