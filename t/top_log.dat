40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) wood characteristics {{and their impact on}} the sawing yield using virtual stem models and sawing simulation procedures. In {{the first part of the}} work, a characterisation of maritime pine as raw material for the wood industry was performed. The stem shape, distribution of knots, and heartwood/sapwood contents were studied. In the second part of this work, the virtual stems provided the raw material for sawing-simulation studies. The stem reconstruction, bucking, and sawing simulation modules of WoodCIM® were used. WoodCIM® is an integrated optimising software system, developed at the Technical Research Centre of Finland (VTT), for the optimisation of the wood conversion chain. The software was adapted for maritime pine and validated. Thirty five maritime pine stems were randomly sampled from 4 sites in Portugal. These were mathematically reconstructed into virtual stems, based on image analysis of flitch surfaces. The 3 D virtual stems included the description of external shape, internal knot architecture, and heartwood core. The reconstruction of the heartwood shape was a new feature added to the reconstruction module during this study. Input data concerning final products and process variables for sawing simulation were obtained directly from the wood-based industry. The average volume percentage of knots in 83 year-old maritime pine trees, varied from 0. 07 % for butt logs to 1. 95 % for <b>top</b> <b>logs.</b> Heartwood diameter either followed the stem profile or showed a maximum value at the height 3. 8  m, on average, while sapwood width was higher at the stem base and after 3  m remained almost constant along the stem height.

40|$|With their {{widespread}} utilization, cut-to-length harvesters {{have become}} {{a major source of}} ‘‘big data’’ for forest management as they constantly capture, and provide a daily flow of, information on log production and assortment over large operational areas. Harvester data afford the calculation of the total log length between the stump and the last cut but not the total height of trees. They also contain the length and end diameters of individual logs but not always the diameter at breast height overbark (DBHOB) of harvested stems largely because of time lapse, operating and processing issues and other system deficiencies. Even when DBHOB is extracted from harvester data, errors and/or bias of the machine measurements due to the variation in the stump height of harvested stems from that specified for the harvester head prior to harvesting and diameter measurement errors may need to be corrected. This study developed (1) a system of equations for estimating DBHOB of trees from diameter overbark (DOB) measured by a harvester head at any height up to 3 m above ground level and (2) an equation to predict the total height of harvested stems in P. radiata plantations from harvester data. To generate the data required for this purpose, cut-to-length simulations of more than 3000 trees with detailed taper measurements were carried out in the computer using the cutting patterns extracted from the harvester data and stump height survey data from clearfall operations. The equation predicted total tree height from DBHOB, total log length and the small end diameter of the <b>top</b> <b>log.</b> Prediction accuracy for total tree height was evaluated both globally over the entire data space and locally within partitioned subspaces through benchmarking statistics. These statistics were better than that of the conventional height-diameter equations for P. radiata found in the literature, even when they incorporated stand age and the average height and diameter of dominant trees in the stand as predictors. So this equation when used with harvester data would outperform the conventional equations in tree height prediction. Tree and stand reconstructions of the harvested forest is the necessary first step to provide the essential link of harvester data to conventional inventory, remote sensing imagery and LiDAR data. The equations developed in this study will provide such a linkage for the most effective combined use of harvester data in predicting the attributes of individual trees, stands and forests, and product recovery for the management and planning of P. radiata plantations in New South Wales, Australia...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} {{and quality of}} structural timber products cannot solely be defined by mechanical properties. It is the totality of features of a product that determines its ability to satisfy the customer. This thesis covers three aspects {{within the context of}} structural timber quality: 	Quality requirements for structural timber products. Performance specifications have been established for a number of structural timber products based on analysis of end-user requirements. The work has been focused on the demands related to constructability (ease of construction). 	Performance control of short-term stiffness using dynamic modal tests. Dynamic modal tests have been carried out and evaluated for prediction of short- term (static) modulus of elasticity of deep and short timber beams. 	Influence of raw material parameters on geometrical performance (warp). The spatial variation within trees with respect to propensity to warp has been studied for fast-grown Norway spruce. The aim has been to form the basis for optimization of log conversion with respect to geometrical performance. Requirements in terms of geometrical and mechanical properties differ substantially between end-uses of structural timber. Therefore, a product-oriented classification system is needed both for the optimal utilization of timber and to assure future supply of suitable timber products for the building industry. The current grading rules for timber do not comply with the end user's requirements regarding warp. Furthermore, the two general timber grading systems of today do not utilize the great potential that lies in the variability of the raw material in relation to the various end-uses. The geometrical performance of sawn timber products, especially with respect to twist, must be improved if timber is to keep its traditional position as a building material. It has been shown {{that it is possible to}} accurately predict the static bending stiffness of structural timber beams with a length to depth ratio as low as 5 using dynamic modal tests and Timoshenko beam theory. The applicability of Euler beam theory, however, should be questioned for length to depth ratios lower than 18 for free-free bending vibrations, since the static bending stiffness will be underestimated by more than 5 %. Twist and crook of Norway spruce timber were found to be larger for pith-associated wood. Twist decreased much more rapidly with the distance from pith compared with crook. Crook was larger in the butt log than in the <b>top</b> <b>log</b> while twist and bow appeared not to vary longitudinally. Heartwood formation in the juvenile core of the butt log did not diminish warp propensity. Twist was highly correlated to the distance between pith and centroid of the stud cross section.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the within- and between-tree variations in the physical and mechanical properties of Pinus radiata (radiata pine). Forty eight trees from a 25 -year-old plantation on the Canterbury plains near Dunsandel in the South Island of New Zealand were felled and cross-cut to give three 3. 6 meter logs. Each log was identified by tree number and position up the height of the tree (butt, middle and <b>top</b> <b>log).</b> At the sawmill the logs were sawn, first by removing 40 mm thick slices known as flitches from opposite sides of the trunk until a 100 mm thick plank known as a cant was left at the centre. The flitches were re-cut at the breast bench circular saw to yield timbers of nominal dimensions 100 x 40 mm. In re-cutting the 100 mm wide cant gave 3 - 5 boards depending on the diameter of the log. The position of every board was recorded relative to the pith and numbered. A total of 915 boards from the 48 trees (144 logs) were obtained. The boards were filleted (i. e. stacked with uniform and sufficient spacing between each layer both in the vertical and horizontal directions so as to ease air circulation) and air-dried to approximately 12 % moisture content. After drying the boards were dressed to 90 x 35 mm and grouped into. one of the four Australian structural grades (F 4, F 5, F 8 and F 11) as each board passed through a stress grading machine. The modulus of elasticity of the boards was measured both in flatwise bending and axial tension. The strength of the boards was determined by destructive testing in tension and compression parallel to the grain. After failure in tension short clear planks (i. e. planks with no knots and any other natural defects) were cut from each board. From these short planks small clear specimens were prepared for the determination of stiffness, bending strength and compression strength parallel to the grain. The investigation of density, stiffness and strength in relation to the vertical and radial positions within a tree revealed that there is a significant variation in all properties with changes in radial positions across the diameter, and a significant variation in strength properties, but not stiffness with change in vertical position up the height of the tree. Regarding between-tree variation, all properties changed significantly. With reference to the production of structural framing timber, stiffness and density were compared as criteria for sorting trees and identifying superior material within logs. This analysis revealed that stiffness is a better criterion for selecting superior trees within the natural population of a forest stand, to improve the value of mill production and to achieve a better outturn in higher value grades (F 5 and above). A regression analysis between the properties of the in-grade timber and clearwood showed that there is a very strong relationship between the modulus of elasticity of clearwood and that of the in-grade timber. As expected there was a general decrease in strength and stiffness of the graded timber as the grade value decreased from F 11 to F 4. Strength and stiffness values in tension, bending and compression have been compared with the current New Zealand, Australian and European code design values, generally giving good recovery of higher value grades (F 5 and above), especially for strength...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate stability related basic wood properties and to determine stability performance of New Zealand grown Douglas-fir and those of radiata pine wood. In this study, nine 60 -year old Douglas-fir trees and thirteen 26 -year old radiata pine trees were selected from forests in Canterbury region. From these trees, 36 discs of 200 mm thick (13 for Douglas-fir and 23 for radiata pine) and 388 boards with dimensions of 100 mm x 50 mm x 4. 8 m (210 fro Douglas-fir and 178 fr radiata pine) were prepared. From the prepared discs, 515 specimens (204 for Douglas-fi and 211 for radiata pine) were prepared for green moisture content (MC) and basic density measurements, The same total number of 515 specimens (205 for Douglas-fir and 210 for radiata pine) were also prepared for shrinkage measurements. From the green MC specimens, green weight, volume and oven-dry weight were measured while for the shrinkage specimens, dimensions and weights were measured at equilibrium for nine humidity conditions. These data were used to analyse basic wood properties and moisture uptake characteristics for both Douglas-fir and radiata pine. Variation of shrinkage within a tree and between trees was also studied for both species. After this, selected specimens (36 for Doulas-fir and 36 for radiata pine) were further tested in water immersion for water repellence examination. The 388 full size boards (100 mmx 50 mmx 4. 8 m) were used for studies on distortion and acoustic properties at a sawmill (Southland Timber Ltd.). Dimensions, weights and acoustic velocity were measured from each board before and after drying. These data were used to analyse distortion and strength characteristics for both Douglas-fir and radiata pine. Comparison of the relative stability of full sized Douglas-fir and radiata pine structural timber was investigated in this study. The results from small sample study confirmed that Douglas-fir is much stronger, has lower longitudinal shrinkage and lower gradient in corewood which can be used to explain the better dimensional stability of Douglas-fir than radiate pine although there is significant variability in the shrinkage for both Douglas-fir and radiate pine. In water immersion tests, Douglas-fir has better water repellency property than radiata pine over 2000 hours period during water immersion. Under the same commercial practice in sawing and kiln drying, it is clearly shown that Douglas-fir timbers were straighter with lower levels of distortion than radiata pine at similar final moisture content. It is also {{interesting to note that the}} final moisture content in a range of 13 - 18 % for Douglas-fir did not have significant impact on timber distortion but a negative trend was observed for radiata pine with MC in a range of 9 - 14 %. Tree heights showed clear influence on twist for radiata pine timbers, but it was not clearly observed from Douglas-fir timbers. Corewood proportion is found to have negative impact on the timber distortion for both Douglas-fir and radiata pine. Douglas-fir timbers showed much higher average acoustic MOE value than radiata pine timbers at similar final moisture content. Because of the various proportion of corewood, the shrinkage varied greatly along the stem height and along the disc radius direction for the two species. This variation caused the difference of distortion between corewood, outerwood and transition wood, but the difference between butt log, middle log and <b>top</b> <b>log</b> is inconsistent. Therefore, it is recommended that the corewood proportion to be a criterion for the timber pre-sorting. Variation of stability performance between trees was also found to be significant for the two species, and methods need to be developed for log sorting as well to reduce the timber distortion degradation. Non-destructive testing method such as acoustic tool may be offered to be a new approach for sorting logs, but it is also necessary to be aware of the significant difference between species. The outcome from this project includes better understanding of Douglas-fir for structural applications. The conclusion can be drawn that Douglas-fir has superior quality for its strength, durability and moisture resistance. Douglas-fir is also claimed to have uniform properties and thus to be more stable compared to radiata pine. Douglas-fir timbers showed much higher acoustic MOE value than radiate pine timbers as similar final moisture content...|$|E

Height to diameter ratio (H/D) had a larger correlation coefficient in relation to stem stiffness than tree height or diameter at breast height (DBH). The longitudinal variation in stiffness of logs, except for first and <b>top</b> <b>logs,</b> in each tree {{was assumed to be}} constant with the height position in the trunk. Tree height in the ring-formed year had a significant negative effect on microfibril angle (MFA) near the pith, in transition wood, and in mature wood. DBH in the ring-formed year had a significant negative effect on density in mature wood. We concluded that the effects of tree height on MFA and of DBH on density produced the effect of H/D on stem stiffness of the trunk. Greater tree height in younger age may contribute to the improvement of juvenile wood properties.|$|R
40|$|Increment {{core and}} wood disc samples were {{collected}} from 10 Pinus radiata D. Don (radiata pine) trees in each of four age-classes in Kaingaroa State Forest in the central North Island. The samples represented (a) young thinnings (12 yr), (b) two stands which had received silvicultural treatments (24 and 34 yr), and (c) an unthinned old-crop stand (52 yr). Intensive measure-ments were made of green density, basic density, moisture content, tracheid length, and resin content. Over the 40 -year age span covered, the average wood properties changed considerably, e. g., green density 1025 - 815 kg/m 3, basic density 325 - 420 kg/m 3, moisture content 215 - 95 %, tracheid length 2. 5 - 3. 5 mm, resin content 3. 3 - 2. 9 %. Average values were calculated for sawlogs, <b>top</b> <b>logs,</b> sawn timber, and slabwood. It is concluded that the change in raw material supply from untended old-crop to thinnings and produce from intensively managed stands will be accompanied by age-related changes in intrinsic wood properties, to which industry will have to adjust. For instance, logs will be heavier because of a higher average moisture content, but will nevertheless have a lower basic density...|$|R
