His masterworks sources included the likes of Cézanne, Mondrian and Picasso. During this time in his career, Lichtenstein noted that [...] "the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> apparently parodied I actually admire." [...] At the time, Lichtenstein was exploring the theme of [...] "industrialization of emotion". In Lichtenstein's obituary, Los Angeles Times critic Christopher Knight said the work was [...] "a witty rejoinder to De Kooning's famously brushy paintings of women".

60|$|Mr. Sherlock Holmes {{listened with}} {{attention}} to the long report which I was able to present to him that evening, {{but it did not}} elicit that word of curt praise which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> hoped for and should have valued. On the contrary, his austere face was even more severe than usual as he commented upon the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done and the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not.|$|R

He put a pen and inkstone into a case and said, [...] "These are the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> used. I would like to present this as a gift to you." [...] (Agawa, n.d.).

[...] During the confirmation hearings, Alito disavowed the group, whose views were criticized as racist and sexist, saying: [...] "I disavow them. I deplore them.

[...] "She always manages to pick herself up when she falls on her face. And I respect that. She is not all high and mighty and she doesn't act like she is always right.
