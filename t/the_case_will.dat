5|$|A {{new trial}} is {{scheduled}} for March 2014, in which Apple will seek to prevent Samsung from selling some of its current devices in the U.S. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>will</b> involve further debate over monetary compensation. In the 2014 lawsuit, Samsung is accused of infringing five of Apple Inc.'s patents in 10 phone and tablet models, while Samsung has responded with a counterclaim, in which it states that two patents for nine phones and tablets have been infringed on by Apple. Jury selection for the trial occurred on March 31, 2014. Samsung stands to gain $6 million if the jury rules in its favor, while Apple is seeking $2 billion in damages and could proceed with similar lawsuits against other Android handset makers, as the relevant patent issues extend beyond Samsung's software technology.|$|E
5|$|Indictment against Blythe {{was brought}} by State Attorney Vladimír Mužík. Mužík had tried {{a number of}} murderers, such as Luboš Mika (life in prison), Roman Fidler (life {{imprisonment}} at 1st instance, 25 years on appeal), Maria Zolotukinová (13 years imprisonment) and Petr Procházka (11 years imprisonment). He also tried a case against Andranik Soghojan, an alleged head of Russian mafia, requesting 25 {{years in prison for}} ordering a murder. The Municipal Court in Prague acquitted Soghojan due to lack of evidence; however, the decision was repealed on appeal by the High Court, and <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>will</b> be heard again by a different tribunal of the Municipal Court. Another of Mužík's murder cases which ended in acquittal due to insufficient evidence is that of Miroslav Rus, who was indicted in connection with disappearance of Miroslav Kříž, a vice-chairman of the Czech Football Association.|$|E

If the grand jury finds that there is enough {{evidence}} that the accused has committed a crime, it may file an indictment.

If the grand jury votes an indictment, <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>will</b> be transferred from Criminal Court to the Supreme Court for another arraignment.

25|$|Historically, barristers {{have had}} {{a major role in}} trial preparation, {{including}} drafting pleadings and reviewing evidence. In some areas of law, that is still the case. In other areas, it is relatively common for the barrister to receive the brief from the instructing solicitor to represent a client at trial only a day or two before the proceeding. Part of {{the reason for this is}} cost. A barrister is entitled to a 'brief fee' when a brief is delivered, and this represents the bulk of her/his fee in relation to any trial. They are then usually entitled to a 'refresher' for each day of the trial after the first. But if a case is settled before the trial, the barrister is not needed and the brief fee would be wasted. Some solicitors avoid this by delaying delivery of the brief until it is certain <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>will</b> go to trial.|$|E

25|$|On December 19, 2006, Federal Judge Henry Kennedy {{ruled that}} the Freedmen {{descendants}} could sue the Cherokee Nation for disfranchisement. The Cherokee Nation's administration appealed the decision {{on the grounds that}} as a sovereign nation, the tribe is protected by sovereign immunity and cannot be sued in US court. On July 29, 2008, the Washington D.C. Circuit Court Of Appeals unanimously {{ruled that the}} Cherokee Nation was protected by sovereign immunity and could not be listed as a defendant in the lawsuit. But, it stated that the Cherokee Nation's officials were not protected by the tribe's sovereign immunity, and Freedmen descendants could proceed with a lawsuit against the tribe's officers. The ruling also stated the 13th Amendment and the Treaty of 1866 whittled away the Cherokee right to discriminate against the Freedmen descendants. The ruling means that <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>will</b> go back to district court. Velie stated this was a great victory for the Freedmen and Indian people who can bring actions against the elected officials of their Native Nations and the United States.|$|E
500|$|Most American {{newspapers}} {{supported the}} prosecution, {{such as the}} New York World-Telegram which reported that the Communist Party would soon be punished. The New York Times, in an editorial, felt that the trial was warranted and denied assertions of the Party that the trial was a provocation comparable to the Reichstag fire. The Christian Science Monitor took a more detached view in an editorial: [...] "The outcome of <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>will</b> be watched by government and political parties {{around the world as}} to how the United States, as an outstanding exponent of democratic government, intends to share the benefits of its civil liberties and yet protect them if and when they appear to be abused by enemies from within".|$|E

Likewise, Christopher M. Holman wrote that the case [...] "should be viewed as a bellwether for an oncoming wave of controversy around the patenting of self-replicating technologies that will challenge the ability of the patent system to respond effectively". William J. Simmons also wrote that [...] "more cases like this will probably be appealed to [...] as these technologies become more prevalent in society".|$|E

500|$|Chicago-based singer-songwriter Rickey Allen pushed {{allegations}} that [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] {{was inspired by}} a song he had composed with the same title and spelling, which was copyrighted in the mid-1990s and 2000 and performed locally during that time. He claimed he handed over a version to producer Maurice Joshua, who allegedly went on to cover the song with Destiny's Child. Joshua denied his claims, noting that he never held a copy of Allen's song. Allen filed a lawsuit against the group for compensation in a Chicago, Illinois court in 2006 where the trio was due to appear in December 10 for an eight-day trial. However, they managed to avoid any given court dates after their public split in 2005 and agreed to settle behind closed doors. In early December 2009 it was confirmed by Chicago Sun-Times that the group had reached a settlement with Allen. His attorney, Matthew Wildermuth, said in a statement, [...] "I can confirm that yes, [...] did settle. All of the issues have been amicably resolved and the case is going to be dismissed. [...] excited about being able to devote time to pursuing his musical career. All legal terms and agreement will not be released and <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>will</b> be dismissed by a judge".|$|E
