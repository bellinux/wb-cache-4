500|$|Finn was {{promoted}} to chief petty officer (E-7, the highest enlisted rank in the Navy at that time) in 1935 after only nine years of active duty. He later commented on his promotions, [...] "Everybody <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> boy wonder. I {{was just in the}} right place at the right time." [...] As a chief, Finn served with patrol squadrons in San Diego, Washington, and Panama.|$|E
500|$|Seropian met {{programmer}} Jason Jones in {{an artificial}} intelligence {{course at the}} University of Chicago. Jones was a longtime programmer who was porting a game he wrote, called Minotaur, from an Apple II to the Apple Macintosh platform. Jones recalled, [...] "I didn't really know [...] in the class. I think he actually <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> dick because I had a fancy computer." [...] Seropian and Jones partnered to release the role-playing video game as [...] in 1992; while Jones finished the coding, Seropian handled design and publicity. The game relied on then-uncommon internet modems and AppleTalk connections for play and sold around 2,500 copies, but it developed a devoted following.|$|E

500|$|Steiger {{was offered}} the title role in Patton (1970), but turned it down {{because he did not}} want to glorify war. The role was then given to George C. Scott, who won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance. Steiger called this refusal his [...] "dumbest career move", remarking, [...] "I got on my high horse. I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pacifist." [...] Instead, he chose to portray Napoleon Bonaparte {{opposite}} Christopher Plummer in Sergei Bondarchuk's Waterloo (1970), a co-production between the Soviet Union and Italy. One commentator wrote: [...] "I watched with extraordinary respect, no, that is not the right word, with enthusiasm, the acting of Rod Steiger in the role of Napoleon in Waterloo," [...] while literary critic Daniel S. Burt describes Steiger's Napoleon as an [...] "unusual interpretation", finding him less convincing than Plummer's Wellington.|$|E
500|$|Describing {{himself as}} a child, Cooper has said: [...] "I never lived the life of 'Oh, you're so good-looking'. People <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> girl when I was little, because I looked like a girl—maybe because my mother would keep my hair really long". He excelled at basketball, and enjoyed cooking: [...] "I used to have buddies come over after {{kindergarten}} and I'd cook them food. I prided myself in taking whatever was in the fridge and turning it into lasagna." [...] He initially wanted to attend a military academy and move to Japan to become a ninja. At an early age, his father introduced him to films like The Elephant Man, which inspired him to be an actor. Cooper says that his parents were initially apprehensive of his career choice, but they eventually changed their perceptions when they saw Cooper play the part of Joseph Merrick in {{an excerpt from the}} play The Elephant Man.|$|E
500|$|Kinsler {{was then}} drafted {{a third time}} by the Texas Rangers in the 17th round (496th overall) in 2003 as a shortstop {{at the urging of}} area scout Mike Grouse. Grouse liked Kinsler's tools, makeup, desire, and gritty approach. In Grouse's {{scouting}} report, he wrote that Kinsler had a great feel for the game, athleticism, solid defensive skills, intensity, and leadership qualities. Grouse knew that Kinsler was probably being underrated by rival scouts who did not know that Kinsler had played with a foot stress fracture while at Missouri, [...] "so [...] really couldn't run like I knew he could. I'd seen him in Wichita the year before, so I knew he was a plus runner. Most people ... didn't know that, so they probably downgraded him. But I knew it, and I wasn't telling anybody." [...] Kinsler, for his part, says: [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lot better than a 17th round pick. I thought I belonged in the top 10 rounds." [...] Kinsler nonetheless agreed to sign with the Rangers on his 21st birthday, for $30,000.|$|E

Sit down and thaw out, while you tell me where you want to go." ...|$|R
500|$|Television {{director}} Joe Wright {{was hired}} in early 2004, making Pride & Prejudice his directional feature film debut. He was considered a surprising choice for a film in the romance drama genre due to his past work with social realism. Wright's body of work had impressed the producers, who {{were looking for a}} fresh perspective; they sent him a script despite the fact that Wright had not read the novel. He commented that at the time, [...] "I didn't know if I was really all that interested; I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little bit more mainstream than this, a bit more edgy. But then I read the script and I was surprised I was very moved by it". He next read the novel, which he called [...] "an amazing piece of character observation and it really seemed like the first piece of British Realism. It felt like it was a true story; had a lot of truth in it about understanding how to love other people, understanding how to overcome prejudices, understanding the things that separate us from other people... things like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ladany {{began his}} {{competitive}} {{career as a}} marathon runner in Israel, when he was 18 years old. Asked whether it wasn't true that race-walking looks funny, he responded: [...] "But in the 1950s, when I started running, people also <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> nut. Jews didn't run. They would laugh." [...] He explained further: [...] "People thought of it only as punishment for soldiers.” ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{about this}} time, Osbourne first met his future wife, Sharon Arden. After the {{unexpected}} {{success of their}} first album, Black Sabbath were considering her father, Don Arden, as their new manager, and Sharon {{was at that time}} working as Don's receptionist. Osbourne admits he was attracted to her immediately but assumed that [...] "she probably <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lunatic". Osbourne said years later that the best thing about eventually choosing Don Arden as manager was that he got to see Sharon regularly, though their relationship was strictly professional at that point.|$|E
5000|$|Eight {{years prior}} to {{founding}} Victoria's Secret, Raymond was embarrassed when purchasing a lingerie for his wife at a department store. Newsweek reported him looking back on the incident from the vantage of 1981: [...] "When I tried to buy lingerie for my wife," [...] he recalls, [...] "I was faced with racks of terry-cloth robes and ugly floral-print nylon nightgowns, and I always had the feeling the department store saleswomen <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> unwelcome intruder." ...|$|R

2500|$|His use of {{corrugated}} steel, {{chain link}} fencing, unpainted plywood and other utilitarian or [...] "everyday" [...] materials was partly inspired by spending Saturday mornings at his grandfather's hardware store.

[...] "But my father <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> dreamer, I wasn't gonna amount to anything. It was my mother who thought I was just reticent to do things. She would push me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film also sparked {{negative}} reactions {{because of its}} content. [...] "A lot of people got freaked out", says Bakshi. [...] "The people {{in charge of the}} power structure, the people in charge of magazines and the people going to work in the morning who loved Disney and Norman Rockwell, <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pornographer, and they made things very difficult for me. The younger people, the people who could take new ideas, were the people I was addressing. I wasn't addressing the whole world. To those people who loved it, it was a huge hit, and everyone else wanted to kill me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August {{that same}} year Muralitharan {{produces}} his career-best test match figures of 16 for 220, in the one-off test against England. In England's second innings Muralitharan bowled a marathon 54.2 overs to pick up 9 for 65 runs, the other wicket being a run out. Ben Hollioake becomes his 200th test wicket. Sri Lanka won by ten wickets, their first Test victory in England. After breaking the world record for the most test wickets in 2007, Muralitharan commented that his 1998 performance at the Oval against England, was his career highlight.

His film crew, who rescued Ramsay by throwing him a rope, reported that he was submerged for at least 45 seconds. During the ordeal, he remembers how he felt: [...] "I was panicking and my lungs were filling with water. When I got to the top after getting my boots off, I was dazed and my head was totally massive." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{accidental}} {{death of her}} only brother, Michael (1911–1932), made Carte the heir to her father's hotel and theatre interests. [...] As a child, however, she had been reluctant to assume the family legacy. [...] She later told The Gramophone magazine: [...] "At home, you know, we weren't allowed to hum Gilbert and Sullivan; in fact we were fined for it, because it annoyed my father. We were allowed to sing it properly, but my brother and I couldn't – in my family the fact that I wasn't Mozart at about three years old was thought of as rather disappointing. So I went through a phase when I was very anti-Gilbert and Sullivan; I became rather a highbrow, and my father <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bit of a snake-in-the-grass because of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Marianna Bishop, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Roma Downey portray Kennedy in the 1991 miniseries A Woman Named Jackie, {{covering}} {{her entire life}} until the death of Aristotle Onassis. Of being contacted for the role, Downey reflected: [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> strange choice because I didn't think I looked anything like her and I was Irish." [...] Half of Downey's wardrobe was designed by Shelley Komarov and Downey stated that though she had long harbored [...] "great respect and admiration" [...] for Kennedy, she {{was unaware of the}} troubles in her childhood. Reviewer Rick Kogan praised Downey with doing [...] "a surprisingly fine job in the demanding title role", while Howard Rosenberg lamented Downey's performance failing to [...] "pierce this thick glaze of superficiality." [...] Ability credited the role with raising Downey's profile. In 1992, the miniseries won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries.|$|E

2500|$|Upon its release, On the Waterfront {{received}} glowing {{reviews from}} critics {{and was a}} commercial success, earning an estimated $4.2million in rentals at the North American box office in 1954. In his July 29, 1954, review, The New York Times critic A. H. Weiler praised the film, calling it [...] "an uncommonly powerful, exciting, and imaginative use of the screen by gifted professionals." [...] Film critic Roger Ebert lauded the film, stating that Brando and Kazan changed acting in American films forever and added it to his [...] "Great Movies" [...] list. In his autobiography, Brando was typically dismissive of his performance: [...] "On the day Gadg showed me the complete picture, I was so depressed by my performance I {{got up and left}} the screening room... I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> huge failure." [...] After Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor, the statue was stolen.

2500|$|In 2013, Wilson explained: [...] "I first felt I {{had a good}} {{voice when}} I was about {{seventeen}} or eighteen {{and was able to}} sing along well to records by the Four Freshmen. By singing along to those records that's how I learned how to sing falsetto. [...] I would sing along to songs like 'I'm Always Chasing Rainbows,' 'I'll Remember April' and 'Day by Day'." [...] He declared in 1966 that his greatest interest was to expand modern vocal harmony, owing his fascination with voice to the Four Freshmen, which he considered a [...] "groovy sectional sound". He added, [...] "The harmonies that we [...] are able to produce give us a uniqueness which is really the only important thing you can put into records – some quality that no one else has got. I love peaks in a song – and enhancing them on the control panel. Most of all, I love the human voice for its own sake." [...] For a period, Wilson avoided singing falsetto for the group, saying, [...] "I thought people <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fairy. ... The band told me, 'If that's the way you sing, don't worry about it.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Later in the year, in November, {{she played}} the role of the Mona Lisa in the two-part episode [...] "Mona Lisa's Revenge" [...] in The Sarah Jane Adventures. In December, Jones starred in the Manchester Royal Exchange's {{production}} of Blithe Spirit, by Noël Coward, which ran until late January 2010. Jones was nominated for the Times Breakthrough Award at the 2010 South Bank Show Awards, the last ever ceremony, but lost to David Blandy. When discussing her nomination she said, [...] "You do question 'What am I breaking through?' Am I breaking through the perception of people who just <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> screaming banshee in Coronation Street? Is it that I've worked hard and I've got better? Is it that now it's alright to say that I'm alright? I don't know what I was breaking through, but I knew that it was nice to feel included and patted on the back for a lot of hard work". Jones was described by Andrew Billen of The Times as being in a category of [...] "those brave, talented few who earn their wings on a soap and then fly gloriously beyond it". In March 2010 Jones starred in Five Days, a non-connected sequel to the 2007 series of the same name, as the female lead DC Laurie Franklin. Later in the year, she starred as Sarah in Single Father on BBC1, a character who {{falls in love with a}} widower, Dave (David Tennant), who was married to her best friend before her death.|$|E
