5|$|Procellariids are {{vulnerable}} to other threats as well. Ingestion of plastic flotsam {{is a problem for}} the family as it is for many other seabirds. Once swallowed, this plastic can cause a general decline in the fitness of the bird, or in some cases lodge in the gut and cause a blockage, leading to death by starvation. Procellariids are also vulnerable to general marine pollution, as well as oil spills. Some species, such as the Barau's petrel, the Newell's shearwater or the Cory's shearwater, which nest high up on large developed islands are victims of light pollution. Chicks that are fledging are attracted to streetlights and are unable to reach the sea. An estimated 20–40% of fledging Barau's petrels are attracted to <b>the</b> <b>streetlights</b> on Réunion.|$|E

5000|$|First, due {{originally}} to Bertrand Russell (1907) in {{a discussion}} of James's theory, is that pragmatism mixes up the notion of truth with epistemology. Pragmatism describes an indicator or a sign of truth. It really cannot be regarded as a theory of {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "true". There's a difference between stating an indicator and giving the meaning. For example, when <b>the</b> <b>streetlights</b> turn on at the end of a day, that's an , a sign, that evening is coming on. It would be an obvious mistake to say that the word [...] "evening" [...] just means [...] "the time that <b>the</b> <b>streetlights</b> turn on". In the same way, while it might be an indicator of truth, that a proposition is part of that perfect science at the ideal limit of inquiry, that just isn't what [...] "true" [...] means.|$|E

50|$|I-277, {{as well as}} {{parts of}} I-77 and I-85, is notorious for being dark at night because its streetlights are not in working order.

A {{proposal}} to replace <b>the</b> <b>streetlights</b> with solar power was denied in 2007 because these lights weren't deemed bright enough (however, two solar-powered streetlights were operating on I-77 at the LaSalle Street exit until November 2007), so new electric-powered streetlights would have to be installed instead. A relighting project finally got underway in October 2008, which involved setting up new light towers at the Independence Boulevard and I-77 exits, as well as installating new lights and removing the old nonworking ones on the Brookshire portion of the interstate. This project was completed by the spring of 2009. A similar project is currently being planned for the Belk portion of the interstate. In addition, highly reflective signs are being installed on the entire loop to give drivers better vision at night without the aid of additional lighting.|$|E
