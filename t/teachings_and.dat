5|$|A {{central theme}} {{throughout}} Symeon's <b>teachings</b> <b>and</b> writings {{is that all}} Christians should aspire to have actual direct experience of God in deep contemplation, or theoria.

5|$|Although Robert {{condemned}} Gilbert Porrée {{in conjunction}} with Peter Lombard, he {{did not agree with}} Lombard's Christology, or views on the nature of Jesus Christ. Likewise, although he disagreed with some of Abelard's teachings, he defended Abelard against charges of heresy. Robert did, however, agree with some of Abelard's <b>teachings</b> <b>and</b> methods. The introduction to the Sententiae proclaims Robert's desire to harmonise the writings of two unnamed scholars, who have been identified by modern writers as Hugh of St Victor and Abelard.|$|E
5|$|But {{he became}} {{increasingly}} possessed by religious mysticism {{as he fell}} {{under the influence of}} the Polish philosopher Andrzej Towiański, whom he met in 1841. His lectures became a medley of religion and politics, punctuated by controversial attacks on the Catholic Church, and thus brought him under censure by the French government. The messianic element conflicted with Roman Catholic <b>teachings,</b> <b>and</b> some of his works were placed on the Church's list of prohibited books, though both Mickiewicz and Towiański regularly attended Catholic mass and encouraged their followers to do so.|$|E

5|$|It {{was while}} Roger was Theobald's clerk {{that he made}} lasting friendships with Gilbert Foliot and Hugh de Puiset.

5|$|Mark McNeilly {{writes in}} Sun Tzu and the Art of Modern Warfare that a modern {{interpretation}} of Sun and his importance throughout Chinese history {{is critical in}} understanding China's push to becoming a superpower in the twenty-first century.

There is a great perceived value in Sun Tzu's <b>teachings</b> <b>and</b> other traditional Chinese writers, which are used regularly in developing the strategies of the Chinese state and its leaders.|$|E

5|$|More broadly, the Restoration Movement was an evangelistic and Bible-based effort {{launched}} in various places as several people sought {{a return to}} the original <b>teachings</b> <b>and</b> practices of the New Testament. Christian leaders including Robert Sandeman, Abner Jones, Elias Smith, James O'Kelly, Rice Haggard, Thomas Campbell, Alexander Campbell, Walter Scott, and Barton W. Stone were trailblazers of similar movements that impacted the eventual phenomenon known as the American Restoration Movement.|$|E
5|$|Smuts's {{religious}} observance was unsurprising in one who whose moral outlook was based exclusively upon Biblical <b>teachings</b> <b>and</b> who was destined {{for a future}} in the Church. Yet, though religion continued to serve in this central role, his studies at Stellenbosch, with their decidedly scientific bias, led Smuts towards a more critical examination of his faith. From this time onwards Smuts was, by gradual degrees, to start {{to move away from}} the uncompromisingly Calvinist outlook within which he had been raised.|$|E
5|$|There is no creator God, {{according}} to Mahavira's <b>teachings,</b> <b>and</b> existence has neither beginning nor end. However, there are gods and demons in Jain beliefs, whose jivas {{are a part}} of the same cycles of births and deaths depending on the accumulated karmic particles. The goal of spiritual practice is to liberate the jiva from all karmic accumulation, and thus enter the realm of the siddhas who are never reborn again. Enlightenment, to Mahavira, is the consequence of a process of self-cultivation and self-restraint.|$|E

5|$|Three core {{principles}} {{establish a}} basis for Bahá'í <b>teachings</b> <b>and</b> doctrine: the unity of God, the unity of religion, and the unity of humanity. From these postulates stems the belief that God periodically reveals his will through divine messengers, whose purpose is to transform the character of humankind and to develop, within those who respond, moral and spiritual qualities. Religion is thus seen as orderly, unified, and progressive from age to age.|$|E
5|$|A {{supporter}} of the evangelical wing of the Church of England, Wilberforce believed that the revitalisation of the Church and individual Christian observance {{would lead to a}} harmonious, moral society. He sought to elevate the status of religion in public and private life, making piety fashionable in both the upper- and middle-classes of society. To this end, in April 1797, Wilberforce published , on which he had been working since 1793. This was an exposition of New Testament doctrine and <b>teachings</b> <b>and</b> a call for a revival of Christianity, {{as a response to the}} moral decline of the nation, illustrating his own personal testimony and the views which inspired him. The book proved to be influential and a best-seller by the standards of the day; 7,500copies were sold within six months, and it was translated into several languages.|$|E

He took Ruth Anne Preece as his second wife and she had three children, named Glory, Power and Hallelujah. By 1902 his fame had spread as far as India, from where Mirza Ghulam Ahmad warned him of his false <b>teachings</b> <b>and</b> made a death prophecy against him stating that he would die within Mirza's lifetime, if he will claim that he was a god another time, which did come true as in the life time of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad he stopped claiming being a god.
