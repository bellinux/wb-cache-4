5|$|During {{the second}} game of the season, Davis hit his 200th career home run in an Orioles uniform, making him the eighth Oriole in {{franchise}} history to do so. On May 16, {{in a game against}} the Tigers, Davis went 3-5 with three runs scored, four RBIs, two walks, a double and <b>two</b> <b>home</b> runs, including the game winning home run in the 13th inning of the 13-11 victory. Davis became just the 2nd player in MLB history to hit <b>two</b> <b>home</b> runs in the 12th inning or later of a game, joining Matt Adams of the Cardinals. Davis also became the first Orioles player with multiple extra-inning home runs during a single game since Mike Young on May 28, 1987. His four RBIs also moved him past former teammate Brian Roberts for 21st all-time in franchise history. On May 18, Davis hit his 250th career home run (208th as an Oriole).

5|$|In the Third Test against New Zealand in 2000, Gilchrist {{recorded}} the third best Test performance ever by a wicketkeeper, {{and the best}} by an Australian, taking ten catches in the match. Although Gilchrist's batting was modest, yielding 144 runs at 36.00, Australia took a 3–0 clean sweep. In <b>two</b> <b>home</b> and away ODI series against South Africa, Gilchrist had a quiet time, scoring 170 runs at 26.66. South Africa won three of the six matches, with one tie.|$|E

5|$|After a short {{stint in}} the minors in 2000, Nathan {{spent most of the}} season in the majors, {{finishing}} 5–2 and even hitting <b>two</b> <b>home</b> runs. But he struggled with his control, walking 63 in 93 innings and ending the season with a 5.21 ERA. He was on the disabled list twice: from May 17 to June 6 for right shoulder tendinitis and from July 14 to August 18 for an inflamed right shoulder, necessitating arthroscopic surgery on the afflicted shoulder {{at the end of the}} season. Nathan divided 2001 between the AAA Fresno Grizzlies and AA Shreveport both starting and relieving, finishing with a disappointing combined 3–11 record and an ERA over 7. Nathan improved slightly in 2002 to 6–12 with an ERA of over 5 at Fresno, but finally overcame his postsurgical struggles to return to the Giants in September with 3 scoreless innings in relief.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 19, McCabe {{was called}} up for the 1930 tour of England despite being yet to score his maiden {{first-class}} century as the selectors chose the youngest ever team to leave Australia. McCabe made his first century in a warm-up match but struggled in his month in England, scoring only 51 runs. His performance began to improve after adjusting his technique and he played in all five Tests, although he continued to have problems converting starts into large scores, failing to make a century during the tour. McCabe managed to maintain his position over the next <b>two</b> <b>home</b> seasons, playing in all ten Tests, but failed to make a century, and after 15 Tests, his average was below 35 although he had become increasingly successful at first-class level.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} time in his career, Costa was an unused {{substitute}} as Atlético won the UEFA Super Cup on 1 September 2012. That December, Costa was involved in several on-field altercations in two separate matches. The first was in a 0–2 local derby loss against Real Madrid where he avoided disciplinary action after spitting incidents between him and Sergio Ramos. He was sent off in the following game at Viktoria Plzeň in the UEFA Europa League for headbutting opponent David Limberský, and was handed a four-match ban by UEFA. This, however, did not deter coach Diego Simeone from continuing to start him, and he responded by netting three goals in <b>two</b> <b>home</b> contests, against Deportivo de La Coruña in the league (6–0) and Getafe in the season's Copa del Rey (3–0).|$|E

On Opening Day, after {{allowing}} <b>two</b> <b>home</b> runs in two innings, Hamels calmed down to pitch 7 strong innings, while only allowing two runs on 4 hits and 8 strikeouts for a 2016 Opening Day win against the Seattle Mariners. On June 12, in a start against Seattle, Hamels recorded his 2,000th career strikeout, becoming the 77th player, and 7th active player, to reach the milestone. On September 28, at home against the Milwaukee Brewers, Hamels claimed his 200th strikeout of the season.|$|E

Four days later, {{in the first game}} of the NL Championship Series, he hit a game-winning solo home run in a 32 victory over the Dodgers. After going hitless in his first 14 at-bats in the World Series, Burrell doubled against J. P. Howell of the Tampa Bay Rays on October 29 in Game 5 (the final game of the series). Burrell was then {{replaced}} by pinch-runner Eric Bruntlett, who scored the game's winning run in the 43 victory as the Phillies won their first World Series since 1980. After the series, Burrell was chosen to lead the Phillies' World Series parade.|$|E
5|$|In an August 16 contest {{against the}} Marlins, Heyward hit <b>two</b> <b>home</b> runs {{for his first}} multi-home run game with the Cardinals. An {{important}} defensive play was on September 20 against the Cubs. With the bases loaded and no outs in the eighth inning, Addison Russell hit a fly ball that Heyward caught running and threw home to catcher Yadier Molina to tag out Anthony Rizzo by two steps, preserving a 4–3 win. In the second game of a doubleheader against Pittsburgh on September 30, Heyward hit his second career grand slam in an 11–1 win, giving the Cardinals their 100th victory of the season while clinching their third consecutive National League Central division title. He also robbed both Francisco Cervelli and Michael Morse of hits in this game.|$|E

5|$|In the 1979–80 European Cup, Linfield {{were drawn}} to face Dundalk from the Republic of Ireland. In the first leg, which was played in Dundalk and ended in a 1–1 draw, crowd {{disturbance}} prompted UEFA to switch the second leg to the Haarlem Stadion, Netherlands. Linfield were held almost entirely accountable for the events, and were forced to pay Dundalk's costs {{to travel to the}} Netherlands as well as an additional £5,000 for damage sustained to Oriel Park. Dundalk were fined £870 for providing insufficient security at the match. Dundalk eventually won the match 2–0 to progress 3–1 on aggregate. In the 1987–88 campaign, Linfield's home game against Lillestrøm was marred by missile throwing, resulting in UEFA sanctions which meant that the club had to play their next <b>two</b> <b>home</b> games in European competitions at Welsh club Wrexham in 1988–89 and 1989–90.|$|E

A rally scheduled by Allegheny County executive Dan Onorato and Mayor Luke Ravenstahl took place {{in front of the}} Allegheny County Courthouse prior to Game 2 of the team's first-round series on April 11. The Penguins' third game of the playoffs attracted the third-highest regional viewing audience all-time for a Penguins game. The 4,200 tickets offered for the team's first <b>two</b> <b>home</b> games of Round Two sold out within 10minutes. As the playoffs advanced into the later rounds, the team had growing support from players and coaches of other teams in Pittsburgh, including the Steelers and Pirates, and many of the players attended games. Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin watched Game 6 of the Finals outside Mellon Arena, along with 3,000 other fans. Prior to the Stanley Cup Final, Mayor Ravenstahl led a rally in the city's Market Square, which featured chanting by the several hundred people in attendance; cooked octopus was also served by 's Fish Market, in reference to the Detroit tradition of throwing octopi onto the ice. The team also opened up Mellon Arena for fans to watch away games on the JumboTron during the Stanley Cup Final; over 13,500 people attended Game 1. Fans who watched the three games played in Detroit raised over $85,000 for the Mario Lemieux Foundation for cancer research. The Penguins also ranked first in the league in merchandise sales.|$|E
