5|$|A ten-member {{team led}} by Leonard Reiffel was {{assembled}} at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago to study the potential visibility of the explosion, benefits <b>to</b> <b>science,</b> <b>and</b> implications for the lunar surface. Among {{the members of the}} research team were astronomer Gerard Kuiper and his doctoral student Carl Sagan, who was responsible for the mathematical projection of the expansion of a dust cloud in space around the Moon, an essential element in determining its visibility from Earth.|$|E
5|$|About 100 {{separate}} {{stations for}} box huckleberry {{have been documented}} in the scientific literature. By the time of Baird's collection in 1845, the West Virginia stations of the plant had been lost <b>to</b> <b>science,</b> <b>and</b> his Pennsylvania colony {{was the only one}} known for some time. Specimens of box huckleberry were subsequently identified in Delaware in 1870, by William M. Canby.|$|E
5|$|After Jones makes another {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt to}} open a doorway at a soccer field in Providence, Olivia searches through old case files related <b>to</b> <b>science</b> <b>and</b> unexplained phenomena, and discovers a geographic connection between the soccer field, the city street, and several of their past Fringe cases. Olivia and Walter {{come to the same}} conclusion, that Jones is going to use a site at Reiden Lake to reopen the doorway, the epicenter of these Fringe events. Olivia, Peter, and Walter intercept Jones while he is opening another window and is halfway through it. Peter triggers Walter's device, killing Jones by sealing the doorway.|$|E

5|$|Gray and Joseph Dalton Hooker went {{to visit}} Richard Owen at London's Hunterian Museum in January 1839. Gray met Charles Darwin during lunch that day at Kew Gardens, {{apparently}} introduced by Hooker. Darwin found a kindred spirit in Gray, as they both had an empirical approach <b>to</b> <b>science,</b> <b>and</b> first wrote to him in April 1855. During 1855–1881 they exchanged about 300 letters. Darwin then wrote to Gray requesting information about the distribution of various species of American flowers, which Gray provided, and which was helpful {{for the development of}} Darwin's theory. This was the beginning of an extensive lifelong correspondence.|$|E
5|$|Nicolaus Copernicus, {{a son of}} a Toruń trader from Kraków, {{made many}} {{contributions}} <b>to</b> <b>science</b> <b>and</b> the arts. His scientific creativity was inspired at the University of Kraków, at the institution's height; he also studied at Italian universities later. Copernicus wrote Latin poetry, developed an economic theory, functioned as a cleric-administrator, political activist in Prussian sejmiks, and led the defense of Olsztyn against the forces of Albrecht Hohenzollern. As an astronomer, he worked on his scientific theory for many years at Frombork, where he died.|$|E
5|$|Salanoia durrelli, {{also known}} as Durrell's vontsira, is a Madagascan mammal in the family Eupleridae of the order Carnivora. It is most {{closely related to the}} brown-tailed {{mongoose}} (Salanoia concolor), with which it forms the genus Salanoia. The two are genetically similar, but morphologically distinct, leading scientists to recognize them as separate species. After an individual was observed in 2004, the animal became known <b>to</b> <b>science</b> <b>and</b> S.durrelli was described as a new species in 2010. It is found only in the Lac Alaotra area.|$|E

5|$|The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) {{announced}} in 2010 that a biodiversity study from 2009 {{in the gallery}} forest of Ranobe near Toliara in southwestern Madagascar revealed a population of giant mouse lemurs previously unknown <b>to</b> <b>science,</b> <b>and</b> possibly a new species. They noted {{a significant difference in}} coloration between the two known species and the specimen they observed. However, further testing was required to confirm the discovery.|$|E
5|$|After Shepard left NASA, {{he served}} {{on the boards of}} many corporations. He also served as {{president}} of his umbrella company for several business enterprises, Seven Fourteen Enterprises, Inc. (named for his two flights, Freedom 7 and Apollo 14). He made a fortune in banking and real estate. He was a fellow of the American Astronautical Society and the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, a member of Rotary, Kiwanis, the Mayflower Society, the Order of the Cincinnati, and the American Fighter Aces, an honorary member of the Board of Directors for the Houston School for Deaf Children, and a director of the National Space Institute and the Los Angeles Ear Research Institute. Together with the other surviving Mercury astronauts, and Betty Grissom, Gus Grissom's widow, in 1984 Shepard founded the Mercury Seven Foundation, which raises money to provide college scholarships <b>to</b> <b>science</b> <b>and</b> engineering students. It was renamed the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation in 1995. Shepard was elected its first president and chairman, positions he held until October 1997, when he was succeeded by former astronaut Jim Lovell.|$|E
5|$|Cope and Marsh were {{financially and}} {{socially}} ruined by {{their attempts to}} outcompete and disgrace each other, but they made important contributions <b>to</b> <b>science</b> <b>and</b> the field of paleontology, and provided substantial material for further work—both scientists left behind many unopened boxes of fossils after their deaths. The efforts {{of the two men}} led to more than 136 new species of dinosaurs being discovered and described. The products of the Bone Wars resulted in an increase in knowledge of prehistoric life, and sparked the public's interest in dinosaurs, leading to continued fossil excavation in North America in the decades to follow. Many historical books and fictional adaptations have been published about this period of intense fossil-hunting activity.|$|E

5|$|In 1947 Warren {{became the}} first dean of the School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Under his leadership, the new school grew from nothing to a major medical school. Although {{controversial}} and opposed by James Bryant Conant, Warren would speak out {{about the dangers of}} nuclear fallout from weapons testing from about 1947 onwards and upon the Castle Bravo test in 1954 his views were lent some credence, which informed opinion leading up to the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Warren became Vice Chancellor, Health Services in 1962 at UCLA. From 1963 to 1965 he served as special assistant to President John F. Kennedy and later Lyndon B. Johnson on mental retardation. Returning to UCLA in 1965, he became professor emeritus, a position he held until his death in 1981. In 1971, he was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award for his contributions <b>to</b> <b>science</b> <b>and</b> medicine.|$|E
5|$|The country {{benefits}} from a highly skilled workforce and {{is among the}} most highly educated countries in the world, with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree. Although Japan has officially renounced its right to declare war, it maintains a modern military with the world's eighth-largest military budget, used for self-defense and peacekeeping roles. Japan is a developed country with a very high standard of living and Human Development Index. Its population enjoys the highest life expectancy and the third lowest infant mortality rate in the world. Japan is well-known internationally for its major contributions <b>to</b> <b>science</b> <b>and</b> modern-day technology.|$|E
5|$|The soils {{in which}} plants grow are {{inhabited}} by microbial communities, with one gram of soil containing around 109-1010 microbial cells which comprise about one gigabase of sequence information. The microbial communities which inhabit soils {{are some of}} the most complex known <b>to</b> <b>science,</b> <b>and</b> remain poorly understood despite their economic importance. Microbial consortia perform a wide variety of ecosystem services necessary for plant growth, including fixing atmospheric nitrogen, nutrient cycling, disease suppression, and sequester iron and other metals. Functional metagenomics strategies are being used to explore the interactions between plants and microbes through cultivation-independent study of these microbial communities. By allowing insights into the role of previously uncultivated or rare community members in nutrient cycling and the promotion of plant growth, metagenomic approaches can contribute to improved disease detection in crops and livestock and the adaptation of enhanced farming practices which improve crop health by harnessing the relationship between microbes and plants.|$|E

5|$|Japan {{is one of}} the top-performing OECD {{countries}} in reading literacy, maths and sciences with the average student scoring 540 and has one of the worlds highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries. The Japanese populace is well educated and its society highly values education as a platform for social mobility and for gaining employment in the country's competitive high-tech economy. The country's large pool of highly educated and skilled individuals is largely responsible for ushering Japan's post-war economic growth. Tertiary-educated adults in Japan, particularly graduates in sciences and engineering benefit economically and socially from their education and skills in the country's high tech economy. Spending on education as a proportion of GDP is below the OECD average. Although expenditure per student is comparatively high in Japan, total expenditure relative to GDP remains small. In 2015, Japan's public spending on education amounted to just 3.5 percent of its GDP, below the OECD average of 4.7%. In 2014, the country ranked fourth for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 48 percent. In addition, bachelor's degrees are held by 59 percent of Japanese aged 25–34, the second most in the OECD after South Korea. As the Japanese economy is largely scientific and technological based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education, particularly related <b>to</b> <b>science</b> <b>and</b> engineering in order to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment opportunities. About 75.9 percent of high school graduates attended a university, junior college, trade school, or other higher education institution.|$|E
5|$|Neuroscientist and {{psychologist}} Pascal Wallisch {{states that}} while inherently ambiguous stimuli {{have been known}} to vision science for many years, this is the first such stimulus in the colour domain that was {{brought to the attention of}} science by social media. He attributes differential perceptions to differences in illumination and fabric priors, but also notes that the stimulus is highly unusual insofar as the perception of most people does not switch. If it does, it does so only on very long time scales, which is highly unusual for bistable stimuli, so perceptual learning might be at play. In addition, he says that discussions of this stimulus are not frivolous, as the stimulus is both of interest <b>to</b> <b>science</b> <b>and</b> a paradigmatic case of how different people can sincerely see the world differently, an acknowledgement of which is a precondition for world peace. Daniel Hardiman-McCartney of the College of Optometrists stated that the picture was ambiguous, suggesting that the illusion was caused by a strong yellow light shining onto the dress, and human perception of the colours of the dress and light source by comparing them with other colours and objects in the picture. The philosopher Barry C. Smith compared the phenomenon with Ludwig Wittgenstein and the rabbit–duck illusion.|$|E
