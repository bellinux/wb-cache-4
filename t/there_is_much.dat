5|$|Aside from fossils clearly {{belonging}} to Plateosaurus, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> prosauropod {{material from the}} German Knollenmergel in museum collections, most of it labeled as Plateosaurus, that {{does not belong to}} the type species and possibly not to Plateosaurus at all. Some of this material is not diagnostic; other material has been recognized to be different, but was never sufficiently described.|$|E
5|$|Neurolinguistics {{is closely}} related to the field of psycholinguistics, which seeks to {{elucidate}} the cognitive mechanisms of language by employing the traditional techniques of experimental psychology; today, psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic theories often inform one another, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> collaboration between the two fields.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> {{interest}} in the coordination chemistry of neptunium, because its five oxidation states all exhibit their own distinctive chemical behavior, and the coordination chemistry of the actinides is heavily influenced by the actinide contraction (the greater-than-expected decrease in ionic radii across the actinide series, analogous to the lanthanide contraction).|$|E
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> {{a little}} thaw when Lord Northmoor {{asked about the}} population, larger, alas, than the {{congregation}} might have seemed to show, and Mary asked if <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> poverty, and <b>was</b> answered that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> suffering in the winter, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> not <b>much</b> done for the poor except by Lady Adela.|$|R

50|$|When <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> {{continental}} crust {{near the}} poles, the rock record shows unusually low sea levels during ice ages, because <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> polar land mass on which {{snow and ice}} could accumulate. During times when the land masses clustered around the equator, ice ages had much less effect on sea level.|$|R
5|$|A small chapel lies to {{the north}} of the central hall. Originally rather austere, it was lavishly {{decorated}} by Barry in the High Victorian style. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> elaborate wood carving, with the altar rail featuring angels and the benches poppyheads. The marble apse has alabaster carved heads of the prophets and evangelists by J. Birnie Philip, and the wall panelling features bronze medallions depicting biblical characters by the same artist. The ornate choir gallery, reached from the central hall's mezzanine gallery, contains the family pew. The stained glass and wall murals are by Clayton and Bell, and the painting and stencilling are by J. G. Crace.|$|E
5|$|Another {{model for}} the {{formation}} of Type Ia supernovae involves the merger of two white dwarf stars, with the combined mass momentarily exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> variation in this type of event, and in many cases there may be no supernova at all, but it is expected that they will have a broader and less luminous light curve than the more normal SN Type Ia.|$|E
5|$|English Poor Law {{legislation}} can {{be traced}} back as far as 1536, when legislation was passed to deal with the impotent poor, although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> earlier Tudor legislation dealing with the problems caused by vagrants and beggars. The history of the Poor Law in England and Wales is usually divided between two statutes, the Old Poor Law passed during the reign of Elizabeth I and the New Poor Law, passed in 1834, which significantly modified the existing system of poor relief. The later statute altered the Poor Law system from one which was administered haphazardly at a local parish level to a highly centralised system which encouraged the large-scale development of workhouses by Poor Law Unions.|$|E

5|$|Fixtures {{include a}} marble font which is {{contemporary}} with the church. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> stained glass: the oldest, {{in the form}} of heraldic emblems in cartouches, dates from 1562 and is visible in the Diocletian window in the east wall and in another window on the southwest side. The east window was erected in memory of Sir Frank Stapleton, rector of Mereworth 1832–74. Other similar glass dates from the 17th and 18th centuries. Another, depicting the Raising of Lazarus, was designed by Frederic Shields for the Heaton, Butler and Bayne firm in 1889.|$|E
5|$|Fossilized {{porbeagle}} remains {{are known}} from Late Miocene epoch (c. 7.2 Ma) deposits in Belgium and the Netherlands, Pliocene epoch (5.3–2.6 Ma) deposits in Belgium, Spain, and Chile, and Pleistocene epoch (2.6 Ma to 12,000 BP) deposits in the Netherlands. However, Lamna teeth that closely {{resemble those of}} the porbeagle {{have been found in}} the La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island off the Antarctic Peninsula, which date to the middle to late Eocene epoch (50–34 Ma). <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> taxonomic confusion regarding Lamna in the fossil record due to the high degree of variability in adult tooth morphology within species.|$|E
5|$|Polled Dorsets are an all-white, {{medium-sized}} sheep, prolific {{and able}} to breed out of season. The carcases are muscular with good conformation and the adults produce a thick fleece, which is free from dark fibers. Since its development, the number of Polled Dorsets registered in the United States has grown to exceed the number of Horned Dorsets. Without horns the sheep are easier to handle and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> less risk of the rams hurting themselves or others by butting. The Polled Dorset is sometimes confused with the Australian Poll Dorset, but that breed did not start as a genetic mutation but resulted from the introduction of Corriedale and Ryeland blood into the Dorset breeding program.|$|E

5|$|Shimura mainly {{found her}} characters' names by looking through name dictionaries, {{although}} she also took {{the names of}} acquaintances and slightly changed them, and even used train station names for side characters appearing only once. Out of all the characters, Shimura is most pleased with Kanako Sasa. For the designs of clothes for the female characters, Shimura consulted various fashion magazines for girls in their early teens, especially Nicola. Shimura commented self-deprecatingly in the afterword of volume one that, like her other series, her characters do not look very different from each other, her panels are too white, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> pathos.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{powerful}} motorcycles {{can generate}} enough torque {{at the rear}} wheel to lift the front wheel off {{the ground in a}} maneuver called a wheelie. A line similar to the one described above to analyze braking performance can be drawn from the rear wheel contact patch to predict if a wheelie is possible given the available friction, the center of mass location, and sufficient power. This can also happen on bicycles, although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> less power available, if the center of mass is back or up far enough or the rider lurches back when applying power to the pedals.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{members of the}} Sicilian aristocracy who still inhabit their ancestral palazzi are unable to make opening their houses to tourism {{a major source of}} income, unlike some Northern, especially English, counterparts. The local equivalent of the National Trust is very small, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> less local interest among the general population. The Princes, Marquesses, and Counts of Sicily still living in their houses dwell in splendid isolation, surrounded often by beauty and decay. It is only today both owners and the state are awakening to the possibility that if action is not taken soon it will be too late to save this particular part of the Sicilian heritage.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Iron Age, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> {{evidence}} for the use of horses in transport and battle, and for extensive trade between the inhabitants of Britain and other cultures. A collection of Iron Age artefacts from Polden Hill in Somerset includes a very large hoard of horse gear, and a rare, cast copper alloy cheekpiece dating from the late, pre-Roman Iron Age was found in St Ewe, Cornwall. The horse was an important figure in Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic religion and myth, and is symbolised in the hill figure of the Uffington White Horse, near the Iron Age hill fort of Uffington Castle in Oxfordshire.|$|E
5|$|Trying to {{sort out}} what has happened, Hermie goes back to Dorothy's house. Dorothy has fled the island {{in the night and}} an {{envelope}} is tacked to the front door with Hermie's name on it. Inside is a note from Dorothy, saying she hopes he understands she must go back home as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> to do. She assures Hermie she will never forget him, and he will find his way of remembering what happened that night. Her note closes with the hope that Hermie may be spared the senseless tragedies of life.|$|E
5|$|Although little {{trace of}} the 10th-century church has been discovered, save {{possibly}} some Saxon masonry found during a 1997 excavation of the nave, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> evidence of the monastery of 1093. This work in the Norman style {{may be seen in}} the northwest tower, the north transept and in remaining parts of the monastic buildings. The abbey church, beginning with the Lady Chapel at the eastern end, was extensively rebuilt in Gothic style during the 13th and 14thcenturies. At the time of the dissolution of the monasteries, the cloister, the central tower, a new south transept, the large west window and a new entrance porch to the south had just been built in the Perpendicular style, and the southwest tower of the façade had been begun. The west front was given a Tudor entrance, but the tower was never completed.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{the medieval}} parish church of St Mary in Old Town, another {{remarkable}} church building in Eastbourne is the redbrick St Saviour's and St Peter's. Originally consecrated under the former name in 1872, it was designed by George Edmund Street but merged with St Peter’s in 1971 when the latter was made redundant and demolished. The Catholic Church of Our Lady of Ransom is a generously proportioned building with a tall Gothic interior. One of the windows commemorates the exiled Polish-Lithuanian nobleman, Prince Lev Sapieha, {{who lived in the}} town, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> other artwork in the building. The recently formed Personal Ordinariate of Anglicans reconciled to the Catholic Church meets at St Agnes, another Victorian Gothic building.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter and dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> to suggest that {{this is the kind of}} environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread by following the coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E
5|$|Due to A. rubrums {{very wide}} range, there is {{significant}} variation in hardiness, size, form, time of flushing, onset of dormancy, and other traits. Generally speaking, individuals from the north flush the earliest, have the most reddish fall color, set their buds the earliest and take the least winter injury. Seedlings are tallest in the north-central and east-central part of the range. In Florida, at the extreme south of the red maple's range, it is limited exclusively to swamplands. The fruits also vary geographically with northern individuals in areas with brief, frost-free periods producing fruits that are shorter and heavier than their southern counterparts. As {{a result of the}} variation <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> genetic potential for breeding programs with a goal of producing red maples for cultivation. This is especially useful for making urban cultivars that require resistance from verticillium wilt, air pollution, and drought.|$|E
