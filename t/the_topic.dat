5|$|The FVdG's {{disillusionment with}} the social {{democratic}} movement deepened during the mass strike debate.

40|$|Abstract — With {{the growing}} number of web documents, it becomes {{difficult}} to analyze and obtain information from such an array of documents. Furthermore, unsupervised methods are preferable, as most web documents are unlabeled. Probabilistic topic modeling is one such method. It discovers latent structures among unstructured documents. While many traditional topic models usually assume that <b>the</b> <b>topics</b> are independent of each other, some models have been proposed to obtain correlations between <b>the</b> <b>topics</b> or a hierarchy of <b>the</b> <b>topics.</b> These models are designed to obtain both <b>the</b> <b>topics</b> and <b>the</b> correlations without using any other method. Therefore, very few studies apply other methods to determine a correlation between topics. In this paper, we apply spectral clustering to group <b>the</b> <b>topics</b> obtained from a traditional topic model, in this case the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that uses spectral clustering for <b>the</b> grouping of <b>topics.</b> We demonstrate <b>the</b> experimental results with various settings...|$|R
