Study {{the effect}} of kaolin clay as a {{synergistic}} agent on flame retardancy and thermal degradation in natural rubber based on intumescent flame retardant (IFR); consisting of ammonium polyphosphate (APP) as an acid source, pentaerythritol (PER) as a carbonization agent and melamine (ME) as a blowing agent was undertaken. The intumescent was examined at different loading (60, 80 and 100 phr). Kaolin clay was incorporated into flame retardant at four different concentrations (0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0 wt % of flame retardant) to investigate the synergism between the flame retardant materials.

The XRD and TEM {{results show that the}} intercalated and/or exfoliated nanocomposites can be obtained by direct melt-intercalation of PP/EPDM into modified LDH and that LDH can promote the IFR additive NP to disperse more homogeneously in the polymer matrix. The SEM results provide positive evidence that more compact charred layers can be obtained from the PP/EPDM/NP/LDH sample than those from the PP/EPDM/LDH and PP/EPDM/NP samples during burning. The LOI and UL- 94 rating tests show that the synergetic effects of LDH with NP can effectively increase the flame retardant properties of the PP/EPDM/NP/LDH samples. The data from the CCT and TGA tests indicate that the PP/EPDM/NP/LDH samples apparently decrease the HRR and MLR values and thus enhance the flame retardant properties and have better thermal stability than the PP/EPDM/LDH and PP/EPDM/NP samples...|$|E

40|$|Finite {{elements}} {{simulations of}} indentation loads {{caused by an}} ice sheet on a rigid conical offshore structure were carried out using the ANSYS structural commercial code (www. ansys. com). A square level ice sheet (20. 0 m x 20. 0 m) pushing a 10 m waterline diameter water cone was considered as the engineering application. The interactions between the structure and the ice sheet were modeled using a nonlinear 3 -D contact element formulation. The mechanical behaviour of ice (constitutive model for ice) is elastic, while its failure was modeled using a multi surface failure criterion. The latter includes {{the effects of the}} strain (loading) rate, temperature, salinity and porosity on the magnitude of ice strength. During the simulations, failed elements (i. e. elements that satisfy the stress conditions of failure criterion) were taken out from the initial geometry of the ice sheet.

It has been shown that the undrained shear strength evaluated in this way is lower for the clay in Scania compared with what experience shows for this type of clay. A literature review was conducted to better understand how the shear strength is evaluated by using CPTU. Also which field methods and laboratory methods that is suitable for study the shear strength of the clay was studied. This study showed that CPTU was calibrated against direct simple shear test and a cone factor, NkT, is used too evaluated the undrained shear strength from CPTU. Two sample sites were selected, Ängelholm and Örtofta, where field tests were conducted and samples were collected. These sites were chosen from the knowledge that there would be over consolidated clay. Field tests and sampling was conducted in June and July 2015.

40|$|Highly {{abundant}} short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases (RDHs) in {{the retina}} were {{assumed to be}} involved in the recycling of 11 -cis-retinal chromophore in the visual cycle. Mutations in human RDH genes are associated with Fundus albipunctatus, a mild form of night blindness (RDH 5) and an autosomal recessive, childhood-onset severe retinal dystrophy (RDH 12). Rdh 12 knockout mice were found to be susceptible to light-induced photoreceptor apoptosis, whereas Rdh 5 and Rdh 8 knockout mice displayed only delayed dark adaptation. However, each knockout mouse eventually regenerated normal levels of visual pigments, suggesting that RDHs compensate for each other in the visual cycle. Here, we established RDH double knockout (Rdh 8 −/−Rdh 12 −/−) and triple knockout (Rdh 5 −/−Rdh 8 −/−Rdh 12 −/−) mice generated on various genetic backgrounds including a rod α-transducin knockout to <b>test</b> <b>cone</b> function. RDH activity was severely reduced in Rdh 8 −/−Rdh 12 −/− retina extracts, whereas Rdh 8 −/− RDH activity was intermediate and Rdh 12 −/− RDH activity was reduced only slightly.

Three-month-old Rdh 8 −/−Rdh 12 −/− mice characteristically displayed a slowly progressing rod–cone dystrophy accompanied by accumulation of N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A 2 E), a toxic substance known to contribute to retinal degeneration. A 2 E accumulation and retinal degeneration were prevented by application of retinylamine, a potent retinoid cycle inhibitor.

40|$|Synergy in {{flame retardancy}} of {{polyurethane}} foams between phosphorus-based flame retardant (aluminium phosphinate) and layered silicates has been investigated. We used pristine montmorillonite {{as well as}} ammonium modified clay (commercially available) and diphosphonium modified clay, which were synthesised by the intercalation of the quaternary diphosphonium salt according to a procedure reported here. The morphology of the foams was characterised through X-ray diffraction (XRD), while thermal properties were characterised by oxygen index <b>test,</b> <b>cone</b> calorimeter and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The morphological characterisation showed that pristine and diphosphonium modified clays are almost slightly intercalated, while ammonium modified one is very well dispersed. The results of thermal characterisation showed that {{in the presence of}} phosphinate enhancements of oxygen index, fire behaviour, measured by cone calorimeter, and thermal stability have been achieved. Phosphinate is therefore an efficient flame retardant for polyurethane foams and its flame retardancy action takes place in both condensed and gas phases. Pristine and ammonium modified layered silicate bring some enhancements of thermal stability while having no important effect in decreasing peak heat release rate (PHRR) and total heat evolved (THE) when used in conjunction with phosphinate; their main advantage is related to the enhancement of compactness of the char layer formed. Diphosphonium clay is instead effective in further improving the fire behaviour of the foams because of the flame retardancy action of phosphonium: both PHRR and THE were decreased. The analysis of cone calorimeter data showed that clays act through physical effect constituting a barrier at the surface which is effective in preventing or slowing the diffusion of volatiles and oxygen, while phosphinate and phosphonium are more effective owing to their combined action in both condensed and gas phases...|$|E

The chemical structure of PETAT was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Thermal properties of the PETAT and IFR systems were tested by thermogravimetric-derivative thermogravimetric analysis (TGA-DTG) and thermogravimetry–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR). The mechanical properties, thermal stability, flame-retardant properties, water resistance, and structures of char residue in flame-retardant composites were characterized using tensile and flexural strength property tests, TGA, limiting oxygen index (LOI) values before and after soaking, underwritten laboratory- 94 (UL- 94) vertical burning <b>test,</b> <b>cone</b> calorimetric test (CCT), scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDXS), and FTIR. The results indicated that PETAT was successfully synthesized, and when the ratio of APP to PETAT was 2 : 1 with 25 wt % loading, the novel IFR system could reduce the deterioration of tensile strength and enhance the flexural strength of composites. Meanwhile, the flame-retardant composite was able to pass the UL- 94 V- 0 rating with an LOI value of 30. 3 %, and the peak of heat release rate (PHRR), total heat release (THR), and material fire hazard values were considerably decreased compared with others. In addition, composites also exhibited excellent water resistance properties compared with traditional IFR composites. SEM-EDXS and FTIR analyses of the char residues, as well as TG-FTIR analyses of IFR were used to investigate the flame-retardant mechanism of the APP/PETAT IFR system. The {{results indicated that the}} efficient flame retardancy of PP/IFR composites could be attributed to the synergism of the free radical-quenching and char layer-protecting mechanisms in the gas phase and condense phase, respectively...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the steps taken to develop normal strength (30 - 80 MPa) selfcompacting concrete mixes with 20 mm maximum size aggregate. For the selfcompacting concrete mixes with 20 mm maximum size of aggregate fulfilment {{of the flow}} and cohesiveness criteria are found insufficient for the mix design. It is found that they must additionally meet the passing ability criterion. A Lagrangian particle based method, the smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH), is used to simulate the flow of SCC mixes. An incompressible SPH method is employed to simulate the flow of such non-Newtonian fluids whose behaviour is described by a Bingham-type model, in which the kink in the shear stress versus shear strain rate diagram is first appropriately smoothed out. The basic equations solved in the SPH are the incompressible mass conservation and Navier-Stokes equations. The yield stress of SCC mixes is predicted in an inverse manner using the SPH simulation methodology and matching the measured and simulated t 500, tstop and the final spread of the cone flow test. It is found that the yield stress of SCC mixes varies only slightly {{with an increase in}} the characteristic compressive strength of the mix. The plastic viscosity on the other hand shows a marked increase. The latter was estimated by a micromechanical procedure proposed by Ghanbari & Karihaloo (2009) based on the measured viscosity of the cement paste alone and on the volume fractions of the mix constituents. The SPH simulation methodology was also used for predicting the distribution of large coarse aggregates in the cone spread. This distribution was found to be indeed very similar to that revealed in the cut sections of the hardened <b>test</b> <b>cone</b> spread. These large coarse aggregates had been painted with non-toxic non-water soluble paints prior to being used in the test mix. The simulation of SCC mixes revealed that the cone lift rate in the slump flow test has a significant effect on the flow pattern and the measured t 500. The latter decreases as the cone lift rate increases from 0. 1 to 1 m/s. The effect on the spread (i. e. tstop) is, however, insignificant...|$|E
