5|$|Crickets {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} insects with mostly cylindrical, somewhat vertically flattened bodies. The head is spherical with long slender antennae arising from cone-shaped scapes (first segments) and just behind <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> large compound eyes. On the forehead are three ocelli (simple eyes). The pronotum (first thoracic segment) is trapezoidal in shape, robust, and well-sclerotinized. It {{is smooth and}} has neither dorsal or lateral keels (ridges).|$|E
5|$|The music used in {{the titles}} {{was derived from the}} classic game consoles, and {{arranged}} by Go Ichinose. Masuda and Ichinose decided not to change the reused music from the basic background sounds {{used in the}} originals, and instead updated them by adding additional sounds. Some of the songs have additional key changes compared to the original soundtrack and some songs that are re-written for the GBA contain sliding between notes. A two-disc set of the music entitled GBA Pokémon FireRed & LeafGreen Super Complete was released, with the first disc featuring all the music used normally in-game, while the second disc featured bonus tracks based on and inspired by the music in the games. Among <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> vocal tracks.|$|E

50|$|Greg Capullo also {{published}} his own creator-owned comic, The Creech, published through Image Comics. <b>These</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> three-issue miniseries.|$|R
25|$|Finally, {{along with}} the 17 {{autonomous}} communities, two autonomous cities {{are also part of}} the State of Autonomies and are first-order territorial divisions: Ceuta and Melilla. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> exclaves located in the northern African coast.|$|E
25|$|The local {{football}} club is Beechwood FC who play at Gyle Park pitches and at Tall Oaks. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> {{of a number}} of football grounds in the area. There are also two tennis centres at St.Margaret's Park and on Belgrave Road.|$|E
25|$|In {{conjunction}} with biblical sources, {{a number of}} mentions of Jesus in non-Christian sources {{have been used in}} the historical analyses of the existence of Jesus. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> passages in the writings of the Jewish historian Josephus, and one from the Roman historian Tacitus.|$|E
50|$|Quarter-finals: (2 matches) <b>These</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> lone matches {{between the}} first four teams drawn from the {{province}} of Leinster.|$|R

25|$|There are two {{offices in}} the Armenian daily worship which are recited between Vespers and sleep: the Peace Hour and the Rest Hour. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> {{distinct}} services of communal worship. It is the usage in some localities to combine these two services, with abbreviations, into a single service.|$|E
25|$|The Ministry of Water Supply and Sanitation Facilities supervises all {{institutions}} {{in charge of}} providing water and sanitation services. Broadly speaking, <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> types of institutions: those in charge of investment and those in charge of operation. However, this separation is not always clear-cut, since some companies in charge of operation also carry out investments.|$|E
25|$|Sea turtles are amphibious reptiles, {{but they}} are not {{amphibians}}. Reptiles belong to the class Reptilia while amphibians belong to the class Amphibia. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> distinct taxonomic groups. Reptiles have scales and leathery skins, while the skins of amphibians are smooth and porous. Unlike frogs, sea turtle eggs have tough, leathery shells which allow them to survive on land without drying out.|$|E
50|$|SSV-33 carried {{only light}} {{defensive}} weapons. <b>These</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> AK-176 76 mm guns, four AK-630 30 mm guns, four quadruple Igla missile mounts.|$|R
50|$|Model {{numbers were}} added to show subtypes. By the late 1930s <b>these</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> digits, the first being {{airframe}} revisions, the second engine revisions.|$|R
50|$|In August of {{the same}} year, the SSB {{received}} its first new vehicles for 16 years. <b>These</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> four-axle motor tramcars of type Be 4/4.|$|R
25|$|The comma {{operator}} has {{the lowest}} precedence of any C operator, and acts as a sequence point. In a combination of commas and semicolons, semicolons have lower precedence than commas, as semicolons separate statements but commas occur within statements, which accords with their use as ordinary punctuation: a, b; c, d is grouped as (a, b); (c, d) because <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> separate statements.|$|E
25|$|Some {{medications}} are CYP2D6 inhibitors {{and reduce}} or even completely block {{the conversion of}} codeine to morphine. The most well-known of <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, paroxetine (Paxil) and fluoxetine (Prozac) {{as well as the}} antihistamine diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and the antidepressant, bupropion (Wellbutrin, also known as Zyban). Other drugs, such as rifampicin and dexamethasone, induce CYP450 isozymes and thus increase the conversion rate.|$|E
25|$|The Cheshire Red Reports concern {{a vampire}} thief called Raylene Pendle. Although she prefers to work alone, she acquires {{a group of}} misfits who join her in her adventures. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> young children, a blind vampire and an ex-Navy Seal/Drag Queen. Bloodshot also {{features}} the world of urban exploration. The Cheshire Red reports were originally only commissioned as a two book series. There {{is the possibility of}} a third book in this series provisionally entitled Sawbones if sufficient interest is expressed.|$|E

5000|$|The name Irugur {{refers to}} Iru+Oor, i.e. Iru="two" [...] and [...] "Oor"=place in Tamil. Earlier <b>these</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> places {{separated}} {{by the river}} Noyyal.Coimbatore International Airport is located close to Irugur.|$|R
25|$|The {{use of the}} {{equals sign}} is an abuse of notation; those two groups are not really {{identical}} {{but there is a}} way of identifying them that is natural. It can be seen to be natural on the basis, firstly, that <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> alternative descriptions of the bilinear mappings from X × A to Y. That is, however, something particular to the case of tensor product. In category theory the 'naturality' of the bijection is subsumed in the concept of a natural isomorphism.|$|E
25|$|PubMed Central {{should not}} be {{confused}} with PubMed. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> very different services at their core. While PubMed is a searchable database of biomedical citations and abstracts, the full-text article referenced in the PubMed record will physically reside elsewhere. (Sometimes in print, sometimes online, sometimes free, sometimes behind a toll-wall accessible only to paying subscribers). PubMed Central is a free digital archive of articles, accessible to anyone from anywhere via a basic web browser. The full text of all PubMed Central articles is free to read, with varying provisions for reuse.|$|E
25|$|From {{the eastern}} facade, two wing {{projects}} towards the east. On the short sides of <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> waterfalls and head sculptures {{of the artists}} who created {{the interior of the}} palace; Pierre Hubert L'Archevêque and Carl Hårleman on the north side, Carl Gustaf Tessin and Guillaume Thomas Taraval on the south side. These sculptures were made by Johan Axel Wetterlund in 1902, and are made of bronze. Between the sculptures there are two plaques honoring King Oscar II on the south side and Charles XII on the north side.|$|E

25|$|Another {{point of}} {{confusion}} was the Two truths doctrine of Madhyamaka, the relative {{truth and the}} absolute truth. Chinese thinking took this to refer to two ontological truths: reality exists of two levels, a relative level and an absolute level. But in Madhyamaka <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> epistemological truths: two different ways to look at reality. Based on {{their understanding of the}} Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra the Chinese supposed that the teaching of the Buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths.|$|E
25|$|Formerly {{known as}} Heart of Africa, <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> of the park's major exhibits. Visitors go down a trail which {{replicates}} habitats in Africa. The exhibit begins in African Woods with scrub animals - vultures, lesser kudu, and giant eland. It then progresses to forest (okapi, duikers, and wattled cranes). The path then leads to African Outpost, which features plains animals - bontebok, common warthogs, ground hornbills, and cheetahs - {{against a backdrop}} of the open-range East Africa exhibit. A central lagoon has lesser and greater flamingos, waterfowl, an island with colobus monkeys, and an interpretive research camp on a separate island.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} of the {{air transport}} service of the Swiss Air Force are stationed at Bern Airport. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> jets and two turboprops. The former ones are mainly used for VIP transport and particularly the transport {{of members of the}} Bundesrat. They are also used for other purposes, for example deportations or to support international peacekeeping measures. The two turboprop DHC-6 Twin Otter and Beechcraft King Air are not usually used for VIP flights, but for the passenger transport {{as well as for the}} country's topography service. The Beechcraft 1900 is also used by the country's topography service for the same tasks. The two jets are a Dassault Falcon 900 and a Cessna Citation Excel, which offer up to seats for VIPs.|$|E
60|$|That <b>these</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> spies on {{the watch}} was, of course, obvious; but {{whether they were}} on the watch for St. Just or for some other unfortunate wretch it was at this stage {{impossible}} to conjecture.|$|R
50|$|The name {{is thought}} to be a {{combination}} of two Hindi names: Ahla and Oodal. In Hindu myth <b>these</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> brothers who <b>were</b> thrown into a fire by their father, the local king, and saved by the grace of God.|$|R
