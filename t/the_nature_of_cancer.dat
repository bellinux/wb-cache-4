40|$|For {{some years}} I have {{believed}} that the three major theories on <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> could be integrated into a single conceptual framework. According to these theories, which have been considered as mutually exclusive, cancer is caused by somatic mutations, by viruses, or by faulty differentiation. At the center is the somatic mutation theory, formerly incompatible with the virus theory and bitterly opposed by Peyton Rous [1]. Today the virus theory is no longer incompatible with the somatic mutation theory because it is comprehended in terms of altered DNA structures, following the brilliant intuition by Howard Temin and the subsequent experiments by Temin and by Baltimore [1]. The third remaining theory is that cancer is merely a case of faulty differentiation, but it is always implied that this is without altered DNA structures, i. e., without somatic mutation [2]. I disagree with this view. I believe that cancer is indeed a case of faulty differentiation, or, as I phrase it, "Oncogeny is blocked or partially blocked Ontogeny " [3].

Current initiatives in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening highlight the importance of identifying any illness-specific beliefs that might influence participation rates within the targeted age-range. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 Italian-Australians aged between 50 and 78 years, living in Adelaide, South Australia. Qualitative data from the interviews were analysed using framework analysis. Participants articulated specific beliefs about <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer,</b> risk factors, prevention possibilities, and variety of potential barriers and benefits to faecal occult blood testing (FOBT). Although participants’ beliefs overlapped with conventional medical models of cancer, the results also demonstrated the presence of specific cultural perceptions that might influence FOBT participation. Our results suggest that models used to inform communication about cancer need to be sensitive to culture specific concerns. Within the context of the older Italian-Australian community, there is a suggestion that self and response efficacy may be serious barriers to screening behavior and that bi-lingual, verbal delivery of information may be the most effective mode of communication to increase screening participation.

40|$|Ionizing {{radiation}} triggers diverse {{responses in}} human cells encompassing apoptosis, necrosis, stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS), autophagy, and endopolyploidy (e. g., multinucleation). Most of these responses result in loss of colony-forming ability in the clonogenic survival assay. However, not all modes of so-called clonogenic cell “death” are necessarily advantageous for therapeutic outcome in cancer radiotherapy. For example, the crosstalk between SIPS and autophagy {{is considered to}} influence {{the capacity of the}} tumor cells to maintain a prolonged state of growth inhibition that unfortunately can be succeeded by tumor regrowth and disease recurrence. Likewise, endopolyploid giant cells are able to segregate into near diploid descendants that continue mitotic activities.
