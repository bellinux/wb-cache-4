5|$|Once {{a common}} sight {{in much of the}} continent, the bald eagle was {{severely}} affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them <b>the</b> <b>thinning</b> of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide DDT. Bald eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to biomagnification. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the bird's calcium metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for the eggs to hatch. It is estimated that in the early 18th century, the bald eagle population was 300,000–500,000, but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 contiguous states of the US.|$|E

Based on {{the rapid}} {{response}} advantages and test problems of <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> film resistor, <b>the</b> analysis {{and research on}} two aspects are focused: First, <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> film resistor {{is used as a}} current sensor which is applied in high-voltage DC transformer. The structure and performance of <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> film resistor are analyzed and simulated. Second, the dynamic characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> film resistor are tested by indirect temperature measurement method. The problem of current rapid temperature measurement is solved. The dynamic temperature characteristic curve of <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> film resistor is analyzed by using multi-exponential spectral analysis method.

25|$|On March 15, 2011, {{a record}} ozone layer loss was observed, with {{about half of}} the ozone present over the Arctic having been destroyed.

25|$|The data {{available}} on the crater indicate that Rembrandt {{is one of the}} youngest impact features on Mercury. Its age is roughly {{the same as that of}} Caloris. The basin probably formed near the end of the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner Solar System about 3.9 billion year ago. The impact had excavated material from the lower part of the crust leading to the formation of the dark and relatively blue impact ejecta, which surrounds Rembrandt. <b>The</b> <b>thinning</b> of the crust, which resulted from the impact, stimulated effusive volcanic activity. Light-colored lavas filled the inner part of Rembrandt causing it to subside, which led to the contraction of the basin's floor and formation of wrinkle ridges. The later floor uplift, which causes are not known, led to the extension and formation of troughs.|$|E
