5|$|A Non-constituency Member of Parliament ("NCMP") is a {{candidate}} of an opposition political party who, despite having lost in a general election, is declared elected as a Member of the Parliament of Singapore ("MP") by virtue of provisions in <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Parliamentary Elections Act enabling the unsuccessful candidates who have performed the best to be accorded the status.

5|$|Chng Suan Tze was {{followed}} by amendments by Parliament to <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ISA in 1989 which purported to return the applicable law regarding judicial review of government discretion under the ISA to that in Lee Mau Seng. The legality of these changes was challenged in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1990). In that decision, the Court of Appeal affirmed that the legislative amendments to the Act were plain and unambiguous, and thus validly established that the subjective test of judicial review now applied to internal security matters.|$|E
5|$|Following the Court of Appeal's {{decision}} in December 1988, the Singapore Government introduced bills into Parliament to amend <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ISA {{to reverse the}} effect of the Chng Suan Tze judgment.

In the 2001 general election, three- and four-member GRCs were replaced by five- and six-member GRCs. There were nine five-member GRCs and five six-member GRCs, making up 75 out of the 84 elected seats in Parliament. This arrangement remained unchanged at the 2006 elections.|$|E

5|$|The Constitutional Court of the Republic of Belarus is {{the highest}} court in Belarus.

The court {{has the power to}} declare any law unconstitutional. From April until May 2007, the Constitutional Court reviewed 101 laws and decrees; they were deemed to be constitutional. The court that deals with criminal law matters is the Supreme Court of Belarus.|$|E

Cases falling within judicial jurisdiction are {{in the first instance}} decided by a single professional judge, while appeals are deliberated in mixed tribunals of professional judges. Lay magistrates also participate in trials. State's Attorney Office is the judicial body constituted of public prosecutors that is empowered to instigate prosecution of perpetrators of offences.|$|E

5|$|After independence, the Parliament of Singapore {{remained}} fully elected until 1984, when {{amendments to}} <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Parliamentary Elections Act were passed {{to provide for}} Non-constituency Members of Parliament ("NCMPs"). NCMPs, who are declared elected by the returning officer, consist of the best performing losers in general elections based on the percentage of votes cast. The scheme ensures that opposition representation is accounted for in the Parliament. In 1990, yet another type of unelected Member was introduced – the Nominated Member of Parliament ("NMP"). These non-partisan Members were brought in to provide alternate views on policies that differed from the opinions espoused by the political parties represented in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Garran {{worked with}} Professor Harrison Moore of the University of Melbourne and South Australian judge Professor Jethro Brown on a report about {{proposed}} constitutional amendments which ultimately became the referendum questions put {{forward in the}} 1919 referendum. Garran had been made a Knight Bachelor in 1917 and was appointed as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1920. Garran attended two Imperial Conferences, accompanying Prime Minister Stanley Bruce in 1923 and in 1930 joining Prime Minister James Scullin and Attorney-General Frank Brennan, chair of the Drafting Committee which prepared drafts of agreements on various topics, such as merchant shipping. He also attended the eleventh League of Nations conference that year with them in Geneva, Switzerland. At the Royal Commission on the Constitution in 1927, Garran was invited to give evidence by Prime Minister Bruce, where he discussed the history and origins of <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> evolution of the institutions established under it.|$|E
