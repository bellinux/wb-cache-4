50|$|Then the breeders {{found out}} that they could earn money without riders. As a Bodacious type of notoriety spread to {{incoming}} bulls such as Wolfman, Dillinger, Asteroid, and Bushwacker, cattlemen started to earn more from selling sperm, merchandise, and licensing agreements than they then did from rodeos. At events called futurities, ranchers could have their bulls compete directly against each other. The bulls would carry dummy cowboys on their backs which judges would rate for bucking ability. The <b>top</b> <b>bull</b> could earn up to $250,000 at a single futurity event. As the prize money grew, so did the sport of bull riding's attention to genetics. Where the rancher was once willing to breed any bull that bucked, attention now turned to specific behaviors. They controlled this through outcrossing and in-vitro fertilization. All that was left in question was who could ride the bulls. As time has progressed the average percentage of bulls that a bull rider can ride has gone down as the bucking ability of the bulls have gone up.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the age of}} four, Skoal Pacific Bell {{began to}} buck, and became the <b>top</b> <b>bull</b> at the 1987 National Finals Rodeo (NFR) for bucking off Rickey Lindsey and Dale Johansen. While the bull {{was part of the}} PRCA circuit, he bucked off cowboy after cowboy, {{including}} many of the best bull riders of the time. These included 1987 World Champion Lane Frost, who was the only cowboy to ride 1987 Bucking Bull of the Year Red Rock (which he did after Red Rock's retirement, in the Challenge of the Champions). Then came three-time world champion and rider of [...] "the most dangerous bull ever" [...] Bodacious, Tuff Hedeman. Skoal Pacific Bell also bucked off [...] "King of the Cowboys" [...] Ty Murray. At the 1988 NFR, World Champion Jim Sharp logged an 85 point ride on Skoal Pacific Bell. It paved the way for one of Sharp's two world championships. [...] "He’s a bull that’s quick and kicks really high and spins real fast,” Sharp later told reporters. “He just bucks hard. It’s a combination of everything that makes him so good. He does it all.” Skoal Pacific Bell also bucked off World Champions Michael Gaffney and Charles Sampson. World Champion Ted Nuce was awarded 83 points on him at the 1988 NFR. And then, at what was probably his last ride before retirement, 1998 PBR World Champion Troy Dunn rode him for 91 points at the 1991 NFR.|$|E

5000|$|Another program {{offered by}} Buckers, Inc., are bull futurities. Started in 2001 as the Buckers Gold Standard Futurity, two year old bulls have {{electronic}} riding dummies {{attached to their}} backs. Note that at this age they are not mature enough to have real riders on them. The dummy is programmed to release after 6 seconds. Accordingly, the bulls are all judged on their performance. The bulls all buck in two rounds, their scores averaged. Then the winning bull is chosen and [...] "crowned." [...] Bulls that complete in this program qualify {{to compete in the}} Buckers World Derby the next year. In the Derby, the bulls are ridden by human riders, which displays how much the animal has grown, improved and reacts to real competition.

BLAD-carrier and healthy bulls were compared on the basis of their breeding value published in November 1997. The first 100 bulls ranked according to the Total Production Index (TPI) were used, including nine BLAD carriers with 2, 835 daughters and 77 healthy sires with 21, 950 female progenies. For 14 bulls the BLAD genotype was not indicated. The healthy animals significantly outperformed the BLAD carriers, which result contradicts our earlier findings (Dohy et al., 1996; Jánosa and Dohy, 1997). In a BLAD elimination programme, the identification of BLAD carriers and properly planned mating are of great importance in order to avoid'inter se'mating of BLAD-carrier top animals which can be of significant influence in Holstein breeding. ...|$|R
