50|$|Thermoelectric cooling {{uses the}} Peltier effect {{to create a}} heat flux between the {{junction}} of {{two different types of}} materials. A Peltier cooler, heater, or thermoelectric heat pump is a solid-state active heat pump which transfers heat {{from one side of the}} device to the other, with consumption of electrical energy, depending on the direction of the current. Such an instrument is also called a Peltier device, Peltier heat pump, solid state refrigerator, or <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>cooler</b> (TEC). It can be used either for heating or for cooling, although in practice the main application is cooling. It can also be used as a temperature controller that either heats or cools.|$|E
50|$|The Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) was {{designed}} at RCA in Princeton, New Jersey. It contained two cameras {{to cover the}} 0.53 to 0.75 micrometer spectral band. The cameras were structurally isolated from the satellite {{so that they could}} maintain their alignment. Each camera was triggered every 12.5 seconds so that the images would overlap in the direction the spacecraft was moving. The cameras each had a 98 km square viewing range, and combined the range was 185 km. The cameras contained an optical lens, RBV sensor, <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>cooler,</b> deflection and focus coils, a mechanical shutter, and erase lamps. Landsat 3 RBV had a resolution of 40 m, which was twice the resolution of Landsat 1's 80 m.|$|E
5000|$|All-aspect seekers {{also tend}} to require cooling {{to give them the}} high degree of {{sensitivity}} required to lock onto the lower level signals coming from the front and sides of an aircraft. Background heat from inside the sensor, or the aerodynamically heated sensor window, can overpower the weak signal entering the sensor from the target. (CCDs in cameras have similar problems; they have much more [...] "noise" [...] at higher temperatures.) Modern all-aspect missiles like the AIM-9M Sidewinder and Stinger use compressed gas like argon to cool their sensors in order to lock onto the target at longer ranges and all aspects. (Some such as the AIM-9J and early-model R-60 used a peltier <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>cooler).</b>|$|E
50|$|Water cooling carries {{waste heat}} to a radiator. <b>Thermoelectric</b> <b>cooling</b> devices which {{actually}} refrigerate using the Peltier effect {{can help with}} high thermal design power (TDP) processors made by Intel and AMD in the early twenty-first century. <b>Thermoelectric</b> <b>cooling</b> devices create temperature differences between two plates by running an electric current through the plates. This method of cooling is highly effective, but itself generates significant heat elsewhere which must be carried away, often by a convection-based heatsink or a water cooling system.|$|R

50|$|When a gas flows over a chilled surface, or chilled mirror, if {{the surface}} is cold enough, the {{available}} moisture will start to condense on it. The exact temperature at which this condensation first occurs {{is known as the}} dew point. All chilled-mirror devices are based on the same basic method: the temperature of the mirror is reduced from high to low, and the temperature at which condensation is observed is reported as the dew point. By obtaining the dew point temperature, one can calculate moisture content in the gas. The mirror temperature can be regulated by either the flow of a refrigerant over the mirror or by a <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>cooler</b> also known as a peltier element.|$|E

However, the socket has been repurposed and continues to be used to power consumer electronics in vehicles.

5000|$|Unlike other tunable lasers {{that have}} a single cavity that is {{adjusted}} to change the wavelength, Santur used an array of 12 or 14 lasers, each at a different wavelength, all fabricated on a single chip at about a ten micrometre pitch. Simply switching between lasers changes the wavelength in a coarse manner. Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is mounted on a <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>cooler</b> to stabilize the temperature. By making small adjustments to the inside temperature of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized. Additionally, the Santur laser package contains a micromechanical mirror that deflects in both x and y axes in order to couple the laser beam to the output fiber. This [...] "switch" [...] is necessary since each laser of the array emits at a different output aperture. [...] The micromechanical mirror loosens tolerances needed for packaging and allows the assembly to be put together with coarse tolerances and aligned electronically.|$|E

50|$|Both {{detector}} focal {{planes were}} {{designed specifically for}} this camera. The optical channel covers a 164 by 164 arcsec (2.7 by 2.7 arcminute, about 8.5% of {{the diameter of the}} full moon as seen from Earth) field of view with 0.04 arcsec pixels. This field of view is comparable to the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 and is slightly smaller than the Advanced Camera for Surveys. The near infrared channel has a field of view of 135 by 127 arcsec (2.3 by 2.1 arcminutes) with 0.13 arcsec pixels, and has a much larger field of view than Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer, which it is designed to largely replace. The near infrared channel is a pathfinder for the future James Webb Space Telescope. The IR channel is designed to lack sensitivity beyond 1700 nm (as compared with the 2500 nm limit for NICMOS) to avoid being swamped by thermal background coming from the relatively warm HST structure. This allows WFC3 to be cooled using a <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>cooler</b> instead of carrying a consumable cryogen to cool the instrument.|$|E

The microelectronic chip <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>cooling</b> {{equipment}} and its test system {{have been developed}} for the deficiency of the conventional cooling technologies in this paper. The thermal resistance analysis model was applied in research the heat transfer process of the microelectronic chip cooling system and its characteristics. The results show that: When the <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>cooling</b> (TEC) system is in normal operating condition,the Peltier effect is the dominant role in the <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>cooling</b> process despite the opposite actions of the Joule and Fourier effects. The thermal resistance of TEC, which is 2 θ, decreases when the operating current (I) increases. For the different chip power, there is an optimum current (opt I) making the interface thermal resistance between chip and TEC minimum (1 θ). 1 θ can obtain the minimum 0. 465 ℃·W- 1 when the chip power is 25 W and opt I is 2. 4 A. The total thermal resistance (totalθ) firstly decreases and then increases with the increase of operating current. There is an optimum current which allows the total thermal resistance is smallest. totalθ may obtain the minimum value 0. 672 ℃·W- 1 when the chip power is 25 W and opt I is 2. 4 A.
