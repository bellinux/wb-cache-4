According to Money magazine, while many economists and tax experts support the idea of a consumption tax, many of them view the FairTax proposal as having serious problems with evasion and revenue neutrality. Some economists argue that a consumption tax (the FairTax is one such tax) would {{have a positive effect on}} economic growth, incentives for international business to locate in the U.S., and increased U.S. international competitiveness (border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustment</b> in global trade). The FairTax would be tax-free on mortgage interest (up to a basic interest rate) and donations, but some lawmakers have concerns about losing tax incentives on home ownership and charitable contributions. There is also concern about the effect on the income tax industry and the difficulty of repealing the Sixteenth Amendment (to prevent Congress from re-introducing an income tax).|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of a {{unilateral}} carbon tax in developed countries focusing on the expected size of carbon leakage (an increase in emissions in non-taxing regions {{as a result of the}} tax) and the effects on leakage of border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments.</b> We start by analyzing the problem using a simple two-country, three-good general equilibrium model to develop intuitions. We then simulate the expected size of the effects using a new, open-source, computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. We analyze the extent of emissions reductions from a carbon tax in countries that made commitments under the Kyoto Protocol (Annex B countries), the expected carbon leakage, and the effects of border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments</b> on carbon leakage, all relative to our baseline projections for emissions. We also perform extensive sensitivity tests on the parameters of the CGE model. Finally, we consider the effects of imperfect border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments</b> on leakage, such as global or regional schedules of border taxes.

40|$|The {{cost-effectiveness}} of unilateral emission abatement can {{be seriously}} hampered by carbon leakage. We assess three widely discussed proposals for leakage reduction targeted at energy-intensive and trade-exposed industries: carbon-motivated border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments,</b> industry exemptions from carbon regulation, and output-based allocation of emission allowances. We find {{that none of}} these measures amounts to a “magic bullet ” when both efficiency and equity criteria matter. Border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments</b> reduce leakage and provide global cost savings but exacerbate regional inequality. Exemptions produce very little leakage reduction and run the risk of increasing climate policy cost. Output-based allocation does no harm but also does relatively little good by our outcome measures.

40|$|Abstract (1285) Ben Lockwood and John Whalley We discuss {{emerging}} {{proposals for}} border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments</b> (BTAs) to accompany commitments to reduce carbon {{emissions in the}} EU, the US and other OECD economies. The rationale offered for such border adjustment is that various entities, such as the EU, if making commitments to reduce emissions which go beyond those undertaken in {{other regions of the}} world, impose added costs on domestic producers which create a competitive disadvantage for them. Some form of remedy is viewed as reasonable to maintain the competitiveness of domestic industries when responding to global environmental problems. In this paper, we argue that despite its current carbon manifestation, the issue of border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments</b> and both their rationale and their effects on trade are not new and, despite the present debate (which seems to overlook older literature), have arisen before. Earlier debate on border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments</b> occurred {{at the time of the}} adoption of the value-added tax (VAT) in the EU as a tax harmonisation target in the early 1960 s. But academic literature of the time showed that a change between origin and destination basis in the VAT would be neutral and hence the use of a destination-based tax in the EU to accompany the VAT offered no trade advantage to Europe. Here we argue that essentially the same arguments also apply for carbon-motivated BTAs, and in the current debate there seems to be a misconception between price-level effects and relative price effects stemming from a BTA, which needs correcting. We also argue that the impact of border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments</b> should be viewed as independent of the motivation of the adjustments. Copyright 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

While the possibility of catastrophic damages contingent on unmitigated climate change provides cogent reasons for self-interested, large countries to unilaterally mitigate there are practical reasons for them not to do so. A key concern for developed countries is possible carbon leakages. For developing countries, the need to pursue growth objectives can restrict the proclivity to mitigate.
