40|$|The exhaust {{manifold}} pressure {{is a crucial}} variable for turbocharged Diesel engines, affecting the torque production and the emissions through variations in the EGR mass flow and in the residual mass fraction in the cylinder.

40|$|Abstract. With the {{increasing}} strictness of emission regulations, development direction of future diesel engines is toward the high thermal efficiency and low emissions. Supercharging technology {{is an important}} means for improving output power of diesel engines. This paper deals with {{the study of the}} <b>two-stage</b> <b>turbocharging</b> system of the non-road diesel engine. Based on GT-Power software code, a digital model of 6112 diesel engine was established. The supercharged model was calibrated by using the original experimental data. Then, four types of digital models with different <b>two-stage</b> <b>turbocharging</b> systems were constructed. The best <b>two-stage</b> <b>turbocharging</b> system was determined through investigating the impacts of different options on the performance of diesel engines. It was indicated through the study that <b>two-stage</b> <b>turbocharging</b> system can substantially increase the air flowing into the cylinder which increases the potential of power density. At the same time HC and NOx emissions can reduce.

40|$|A {{research}} project {{was carried out}} in which a DAF engine was equipped with a <b>two-stage</b> <b>turbocharging</b> system. Objectives were to investigate an engine concept with very high BMEP (25 - 30 bars), maintaining acceptable emissions and fuel consumption, while concentrating on the control system and transient performance. <b>Two-stage</b> <b>turbocharging</b> has several advantages compared with single stage turbocharging. <b>Two-stage</b> <b>turbocharging</b> enables high specific power levels across a broad speed range. In addition transient behaviour of a two-stage turbocharged engine is improved because of the combination of a small (and fast) High Pressure turbocharger and a larger Low Pressure turbocharger. Especially at high intake manifold pressures (pressure ratio > 3. 5) the overall efficiency of <b>two-stage</b> <b>turbocharging</b> is better than with single state turbocharging. The two-stage system on the engine that was tested consists of two parallel Low Pressure turbochargers, a High Pressure turbocharger with controlled by-pass valve, and a cooler behind the High Pressure compressor. With this configuration BSFC was optimised, while maintaining EURO III emission levels. Also transient tests were carried out, whereby the transient behaviour was compared with that of the current DAF engine. In the development of the control algorithms for the by-pass valve, simulatons were used with a complete engine model built in Matrixx. These simulations were also used to estimate transient performance of the engine concept, prior to the test program. In addition the engine model was used to analyse the measured data, and to understand several transient effects that play a role. The results show that <b>two-stage</b> <b>turbocharging</b> is an effective way to increase specific power output while maintaining acceptable fuel consumption and transient performance...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the possibilities of applying high EGR rates with low NOx and PM emission levels on a <b>two-stage</b> <b>turbocharged</b> 12 liter heavy duty diesel engine. The EGR is applied by using a long and short route EGR system. For the ESC operating points A 25 and C 100 EGR is applied, such that the NOx emission is 0. 5 g/kWh. Lowest PM level and BSFC are achieved when long route EGR is applied in A 25 and short route is applied in C 100. Increasing the fuel line pressure is an effective way to reduce PM at high EGR rate engine running conditions. At a fuel line pressure of 2400 bar PM emission are 0. 06 g/kWh for A 25 and 0. 54 g/kWh for C 100. At C 100 the PM reduction coincides with also a significant fuel consumption improvement. Retarding the injection timing at C 100 can improve the PM emission further to a level of 0. 13 g/kWh at the expense of an increase in BSFC. From the results it can be concluded that a minimal engine out NOx emission level of 0. 75 g/kWh is required for meeting Euro- 6 / US 2010 emission levels with additionally installed NOx and PM aftertreatment systems...|$|R

Design is supported by cfd- 1 d engine simulations, using an experimentally calibrated model. The goal of the supercharging system is to deliver the required values of boost pressure at steady operating conditions, and to maintain or improve the full size engine response during acceleration (one of the most critical issues for downsized engines). Two options have been considered: 1) <b>two-stage</b> <b>turbocharging,</b> with two small turbochargers as a high-pressure stage, and one big turbo as low pressure stage (referred to as "TRITURBO"; 2) two-stage supercharging made up of one low pressure stage turbocharger and one electric supercharger (referred to as "E-SUPER"). It was found that both configurations not only allow the downsized engine to comply with the performance targets at wide open throttle, steady conditions, but they are also able to improve the transient response in comparison to the full size engine. TRITURBO is less expensive than E-SUPER, but also less fuel efficient and more difficult to install on the vehicle...|$|E
40|$|The engine concept {{partially}} premixed combustion (PPC) {{has proved}} higher gross indicated efficiency compared to conventional diesel combustion engines. The relatively simple {{implementation of the}} concept is an advantage, however, high gas exchange losses has made its use challenging in multi-cylinder heavy duty engines. With high rates of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) to dilute the charge and hence limit the combustion rate, the resulting exhaust temperatures are low. The selected boost system must therefore be efficient {{which could lead to}} large, complex and costly solutions. In the presented work experiments and modelling were combined to evaluate different turbocharger configurations for the PPC concept. Experiments were performed on a multi-cylinder engine. The engine was modified to incorporate long route EGR and a single-stage turbocharger, however, with compressed air from the building being optionally supplied to the compressor. Experimental combustion heat release rates and boundary conditions were used to validate a simulation model. This model was then used to compare three different turbochargers: two single-stage turbochargers and one two-stage. The whole speed and load range was covered in the simulations to determine the engine performance. The influence of high EGR rates as well as the effect of charge air and EGR cooler gas outlet temperatures were also investigated. The simulation results showed that the <b>two-stage</b> <b>turbocharger</b> was able to give the highest load over the whole speed range with a brake mean effective pressure of 25. 6 bar, whereas the two single-stage turbochargers reached 22. 2 and 23. 1 bar respectively. The average brake efficiency was 39. 3, 39. 7 and 40. 2 %. It was found that decreasing the inlet temperature is critical for obtaining high loads and system efficiencies. Finally, it was shown that the optimal amount of EGR was dependent on the turbocharger efficiency and cooler temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{optimization}} based {{control and}} estimation techniques have gained increasing popularity, {{because of their}} ability to treat a wide range of problems and applications. They rely on the explicit formulation of a cost function, which needs to be minimized given the constraints of the problem and the system dynamics. Especially in the context of real-time applications of control and estimation on embedded hardware, the computational burden associated with the online solution of the optimal control problem forms the main limiting factor in the deployment of such an advanced strategy. For that purpose, this thesis considers the development of tailored algorithms of simulation methods for embedded optimization that allows for an efficient implementation of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) or moving horizon estimation (MHE). A direct treatment of the optimal control problem requires the numerical simulation of the continuous time nonlinear dynamics and the solution of the resulting large but structured optimization problem. We additionally propose a new format to define the dynamic model, which allows one to directly exploit the present structure of linear or partially linear subsystems in the formulation of the system dynamics. In addition, we also discuss embedded optimization algorithms for a more general set of interconnected subsystems based on a distributed multiple shooting technique. As we focus on Newton-type optimization algorithms, it is important to extend the numerical simulation method with an efficient propagation of its first and possibly higher order derivative information. We discuss the tailored implementation of such a sensitivity analysis for both explicit and implicit integration, such as the collocation methods that form a specific family of implicit Runge-Kutta schemes. In addition, a novel Hessian propagation scheme is proposed for both a discrete and continuous time sensitivity analysis, which allows one to maintain and exploit the symmetry of the second order derivatives. Based on these symmetric sensitivity equations, an alternative three-sweep propagation (TSP) technique is presented and analyzed. When embedding an implicit integration scheme within a direct multiple shooting based Newton-type optimization algorithm, one ends up with an outer and inner level of iterations which is typically not the most efficient computational approach. We therefore propose an alternative implementation, which we refer to as a lifted collocation integrator, and discuss its advantages and disadvantages compared to multiple shooting and direct collocation. Two alternative extensions to inexact Newton based optimization are presented, using either an adjoint differentiation technique or an iterative sensitivity propagation. We establish new theoretical results on the local convergence of this inexact Newton scheme with iterated sensitivities. Unlike for previously existing algorithms, we show that local convergence for the inner scheme is necessary and often also sufficient for asymptotic contraction of the new proposed optimization method. In addition to the use of tailored optimal control algorithms, the performance of embedded applications strongly relies on efficient code implementations. This thesis therefore includes an implementation of the major new algorithmic techniques as part of the automatic code generation tool within the open-source ACADO Toolkit software package. We discuss some of the main real-world control applications that were made possible using such an ACADO code generated solver. More specifically, we discuss the airpath control for a <b>two-stage</b> <b>turbocharged</b> gasoline engine in more detail.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a lifecycle (well-to-wheel) analysis {{to determine the}} CO 2 emissions associated with ethanol blended gasoline in optimized turbocharged engines. This study provides a more accurate assessment on the best-achievable CO 2 emission of ethanol blended gasoline mixtures in future engines. The optimal fuel blend (lowest CO 2 emitting fuel) is identified. A range of gasoline fuels is studied, containing different ethanol volume percentages (E 0 –E 40), research octane numbers (RON, 92 – 105), and octane sensitivities (8. 5 – 15. 5). Sugarcane-based and cellulosic ethanol-blended gasolines are shown {{to be effective in}} reducing lifecycle CO 2 emission, while corn-based ethanol is not as effective. A refinery simulation of production emission was utilized, and combined with vehicle fuel consumption modeling to determine the lifecycle CO 2 emissions associated with ethanol-blended gasoline in turbocharged engines. The critical parameters studied, and related to blended fuel lifecycle CO 2 emissions, are ethanol content, research octane number, and octane sensitivity. The lowest-emitting blended fuel had an ethanol content of 32  vol%, RON of 105, and octane sensitivity of 15. 5; resulting in a CO 2 reduction of 7. 1 %, compared to the reference gasoline fuel and engine technology. The advantage of ethanol addition is greatest on a per unit basis at low concentrations. Finally, this study shows that engine-downsizing technology can yield an additional CO 2 reduction of up to 25. 5 % in a <b>two-stage</b> downsized <b>turbocharged</b> engine burning the optimum sugarcane-based fuel blend.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of aero-thermal inter-stage phenomena on the performance prediction of two-stage sequential turbocharging systems. A novel methodology to measure performance of <b>two-stage</b> <b>turbocharging</b> systems into equivalent maps has been implemented and detailed. Investigation of a two-stage sequential turbocharging system has been performed in a steady turbocharger gas-stand, obtaining thermodynamic properties of the complete turbocharging system. The measurement of equivalent maps and the combination of stand-alone HP and LP turbochargers maps {{have led to the}} quantification of inter-stage effects and the influence on performance predictions of the two-stage systems. In this study, equivalent two-stage and combined HP and LP stand-alone maps are compared in order to quantify the variation of performance affecting the two-stage system. Specifically, a simplified 1 D model of the two-stage system flow path is developed for the investigation. In order to quantify {{the influence of}} inter-stage effects, heat correction of the diabatic compressor and turbine maps has been implemented. In conclusion, in comparison to equivalent two-stage maps, combined stand-alone maps predict a significantly higher pressure ratio and efficiency for the compressor system at conditions of low equivalent speed, while the turbine net efficiency is missed by about 10 % at elevated corrected mass flow operations...|$|E
40|$|In {{regulated}} two-stage sequential turbocharging systems, a smaller, {{high pressure}} (HP), and a larger, low pressure (LP), turbocharger are sequentially positioned {{to recover the}} energy available in the exhaust gases and deliver acceptable level of boost to the intake of an internal combustion engine. Due to the different sizes of the turbochargers, by-pass valves are placed in the system to control operations. Due to the turbocharging system layout, {{it is clear that}} the air pressurized by the LP compressor enters nonuniformly the HP compressor. This is caused by the rotating radial compressor and the interconnecting bends which cause swirl and velocity to scatter, respectively. Furthermore, the heat transfer in the two turbochargers may have an effect on the apparent efficiencies. For these reasons, the standard mapping approach for turbochargers is not able to take into account the effect of non-uniform flow and heat transfer. In this paper, a novel approach for mapping the <b>two-stage</b> <b>turbocharging</b> system is proposed and performed into a monodimensional simulation code. Although, flow non-uniformity and turbochargers heat transfer effects on the performance of the turbocharging system are not considered, at this present time, the study centralizes on the investigation and the validation of the mapping approach. In fact, a two-stage sequential turbocharging system has been considered for the study and a simulation code to investigate the mapping technique has been implemented...|$|E
40|$|The finite {{response}} {{time of the}} turbocharger is the most notable effect oftransient operation on a turbocharged diesel engine. To fulfil future emission requirements high amounts of transient EGR will be required. This impliesthat advanced turbocharger systems have to be introduced to enable high boost pressures with improved or at least maintained {{response time}}. The increased amount of tunable parameters from the more advanced turbocharging system will {{make it difficult to}} optimise the engine experimentally. Therefore the wish is to optimise the engine numerically, however this is a difficult task which demands more knowledge within the field of modelling the gas exchange system and its components, which is the aim of the present work. Engine simulations have been performed in the 1 -dimensional fluid dynamic code GT-Power for transient operation and validated with engine measurements. The turbine was modelled according to {{the state of the art}} which is via look-up tables with measured turbine performance data from a steady-flow rig and used under the assumption that the turbine behaves in a quasi-steady manner. Turbine performance data was also obtained via the semi-empirical turbine design software, Rital for comparison. A heavy-duty diesel engine has been modelled with two different gas exchange system configurations. The standard configuration with a single twin-entry turbine and a rebuilt gas exchange system including a <b>two-stage</b> <b>turbocharging</b> system and high pressure loop for EGR. The results shows that it is difficult to predict the performance of the gas exchange system and its components, especially the turbine performance. When trying to predict turbine performance under transient operation the difficulties added, compared to stationary operation are long scale transients as wall temperature gradients in the cylinder and the exhaust manifold which directly influences the amount of isentropic energy to the turbine. This makes it even more difficult to predict the isentropic exhaust gas energy content compared to stationary operation, which is difficult to measure and therefore to state how well the turbine model actually performs. However, even though it is difficult to predict engine performance in detail the models have proved to be useful for concept studies as a help in engine design. QC 2010112...|$|E
