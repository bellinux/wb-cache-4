5|$|As {{the largest}} Canadian cities {{grew in the}} 1950s and 1960s, the volume of mail passing through the country's postal system also grew, to billions of items by the 1950s and {{tens of billions of}} items by the mid-1960s. Consequently, it became {{progressively}} more difficult for employees who handsorted mail to memorize and keep track of all the individual letter-carrier routes within each city. New technology that allowed mail to be delivered faster also contributed to the pressure for these employees <b>to</b> <b>properly</b> sort the mail.|$|E
5|$|By 1986, {{the company}} was once again in serious {{financial}} trouble. During 1985 they had taken the show outside Quebec to a lukewarm response. In Toronto they performed {{in front of a}} 25% capacity crowd after not having enough money <b>to</b> <b>properly</b> market the show. Gilles Ste-Croix, dressed in a monkey suit, walked through downtown Toronto as a desperate publicity stunt. A later stop in Niagara Falls turned out to be equally problematic.|$|E

His agents claimed that Balfour would have opposed her trial for alleged adultery, but he was portrayed as too close to Liverpool's Tory ministry <b>to</b> <b>properly</b> represent interests of the borough.

5|$|Instrument {{builders}} developed {{other features}} that endure today. For example, while organs with multiple keyboards and pedals already existed, the first organs with solo stops {{emerged in the}} early fifteenth century. These stops were meant to produce a mixture of timbres, a development needed for the complexity of music of the time. Trumpets evolved into their modern form to improve portability, and players used mutes <b>to</b> <b>properly</b> blend into chamber music.|$|E
5|$|More specifically, for example, Nancy Folbre {{examines}} {{the role of}} children as public goods and how the non-market labor of parents contributes {{to the development of}} human capital as a public service. In this sense, children are positive externality which is under-invested according to traditional analysis. Folbre indicates that this oversight partially results from failing <b>to</b> <b>properly</b> examine non-market activities.|$|E
5|$|Mutations {{that affect}} the rate or the extent of RCL {{insertion}} into the A-sheet can cause the serpin to undergo its S to R conformational change before having engaged a protease. Since a serpin can only make this conformational change once, the resulting misfired serpin is inactive and unable <b>to</b> <b>properly</b> control its target protease. Similarly, mutations that promote inappropriate transition to the monomeric latent state cause disease by {{reducing the amount of}} active inhibitory serpin. For example, the disease-linked antithrombin variants wibble and wobble, both promote formation of the latent state.|$|E

50|$|Interestingly, mutant {{channels}} that are able <b>to</b> traffic <b>properly</b> <b>to</b> the membrane have a negatively shifted voltage-dependence of inactivation.

5|$|Palmer {{begins by}} {{defending}} {{the claim that}} animals have moral standing, and then surveys three key approaches to animal ethics; utilitarian approaches, animal rights approaches, and capabilities approaches. All are lacking, she argues, as they are fundamentally capacity-oriented, and thus unable <b>to</b> <b>properly</b> take account of human relationships to animals. However, her approach leans more strongly towards a Regan-inspired rights view. She next identifies different kinds of relations humans may have with animals: affective, contractual and, most significantly, causal.|$|E
5|$|Reaction to Melanie was {{primarily}} negative; critics expressed disapproval of {{her decision to}} support her boyfriend instead of enrolling in medical school. Media commentators also panned the character's representation as a mother, such as her inability <b>to</b> <b>properly</b> care for her stepson. On the other hand, fans responded positively to Melanie and felt drawn to her relationship with Derwin. Mowry's performance received positive feedback from critics, who agreed that the role displayed her maturity as an actress. She received nominations for two NAACP Image Awards and a Teen Choice Award for the role.|$|E
