40|$|The {{rotatable}} socket acts positively on a <b>threaded</b> <b>spindle.</b> The <b>threaded</b> <b>spindle</b> {{is connected}} to a transport component (2) connectable to a bone segment separated from one fracture end and arranged between two bone parts. The transport component is movable along the longitudinal axis in the sleeve (1) by rotation of the rotatable socket (9). The fixture of the bone segment separated from one fracture end is by a bone screw (E) fitted in a longitudinal guide in the sleeve. The <b>threaded</b> <b>spindle</b> and a <b>threaded</b> socket (3) accommodated and fixed in the sleeve have different threads and are exchangeable. A tooth component (5) which has interengaging teeth (4 a, 4 b) engages on both sides on the sleeve and on a driver (6). USE/ADVANTAGE - The bone marrow nail does not influence the healing process negatively through {{the formation of a}} tissue bulge and the original length of the broken bone, with improved healing conditions, is further producible...|$|R
5000|$|A {{backplate}} with threads may screw onto a <b>threaded</b> <b>spindle</b> nose (for lathe work) or onto an {{adapter plate}} {{with the same}} nose, to be mounted on the table of milling machines or surface grinding machines. This [...] "threaded spindle nose" [...] type of mounting was the typical method in the 19th century through 1930s. It is simple and useful, but the degree of control of concentricity is not quite {{good enough to be}} foolproof for high-speed, high-precision work (high precision can be achieved, but the time and skill involved in the setups makes it a poor choice now that better options exist, such as the cam-lock spindle noses described below). <b>Threaded</b> <b>spindle</b> noses are still built on new machine tools, but only of the low-end variety (hobbyist, least-expense MRO, etc.). High-capital manufacturing (where high upfront expense yields lowest possible unit expense for mid- to high-volume part counts of high-precision parts) has moved away from this type of mounting. The exact-adjust (Set-Tru) concept is one way to chase high concentricity on <b>threaded</b> <b>spindle</b> noses with some relative degree of ease.|$|R

40|$|There are {{at least}} two {{articulated}} levers (16, 18) arranged in a mirror image formation and linked to shared outer links (12, 14) have toggle links (20, 22) rigidly connected at an adjustable spacing. The first outer link (12) is connectable to the drive of the press, and the second, lower outer link (14) is connected to a press plunger. An adjustment (32, 34) consists of a linear drive piece joining the toggle links and consisting of a <b>threaded</b> <b>spindle</b> (32) and an adjusting motor (34). Each articulated lever consists of pairs of levers (26, 24; 28, 30) joined by the outer links and by bolts (19) belonging to the inner links.

50|$|Unless a {{workpiece}} has a taper machined onto it which perfectly matches the internal taper in the <b>spindle,</b> or has <b>threads</b> which perfectly match the external <b>threads</b> on the <b>spindle</b> (two conditions which rarely exist), an accessory {{must be used}} to mount {{a workpiece}} to the spindle.|$|R
50|$|A {{ring frame}} was {{constructed}} from cast iron, and later pressed steel. On {{each side of}} the frame are the spindles, above them are draughting (drafting) rollers and on top is a creel loaded with bobbins of roving. The roving (unspun thread) passes downwards from the bobbins to the draughting rollers. Here the back roller steadied the incoming thread, while the front rollers rotated faster, pulling the roving out and making the fibres more parallel. The rollers are individually adjustable, originally by mean of levers and weights. The attenuated roving now passes through a thread guide that is adjusted to be centred above the <b>spindle.</b> <b>Thread</b> guides are on a thread rail which allows them to be hinged out of the way for doffing or piecing a broken thread. The attenuated roving passes down to the spindle assembly, where it is threaded though a small D ring called the traveller. The traveller moves along the ring. It is this that gives the ring frame its name. From here the thread is attached to the existing <b>thread</b> on the <b>spindle.</b>|$|R
40|$|Today {{spot welding}} {{is still the}} most applied joining {{technique}} in the automotive industry. But new developed materials require the adaption and enhancement of this technology for a robust joining process. Investigations were focused on weld-ability of high- and ultra high strength steels like HT 700 T (TRIP steel) or 22 MnB 5 (press hardening steel) by using a servo-mechanical drive for electrode force as well as power control instead of conventional welding current controller. The results of the experiments showed that the TRIP-steel as well as the press hardening steel can be safely welded with an electrode force of more than 5 kN and an welding current of about 8 kA. Best results were achieved with a process control using multiple current impulses. By using an after-heat impulse hardness of spot welds is decreased and the failure mode of the specimen during the chisel test could be improved. The course of hardness across the spot weld lens as well as inside of the base material is already on a high level but drops significantly steep inside of heat affected zone (HAZ). The advantage of the servo mechanical electrode drive is the backlash-free <b>threaded</b> <b>spindle</b> which leads to an increase of electrode force because of the thermal expansion of material during heating up to melting temperature. This effect improves the weldability of 22 MnB 5 and leads to an increase in tool-life time of the spot welding electrodes. The use of process control with controlled welding power in conjunction with a multi impulse process have favorable effects on the results of the tensile tests and ensures a robust welding process. It could be proven that, if the appropriate welding parameters are chosen, joining of HT 700 T as well as 22 MnB 5 by resistance spot welding is possible where the welded connections fulfill the requirements of quality in respect of lens diameter, connection strength and failure mode...|$|R

60|$|One evening Fru Astrida {{sat in her}} tall {{chair in}} the chimney corner, her distaff, with its load of flax in her hand, while she twisted and drew out the <b>thread,</b> and her <b>spindle</b> danced on the floor. Opposite to her sat, {{sleeping}} in his chair, Sir Eric de Centeville; Osmond was on a low bench within the chimney corner, trimming and shaping with his knife some feathers of the wild goose, which were to fly in a different fashion from their former one, and serve, not to wing the flight of a harmless goose, but of a sharp arrow.|$|R
40|$|Presently, {{the rotary}} wing-head and hub {{subassemblies}} of the Army’s Black Hawk helicopter require almost complete disassembly to inspect failure critical threads {{of the main}} spindle. Even with {{direct access to the}} threads, detection of fatigue cracks in the thread roots is very difficult using visual and penetrant methods. Therefore, the purpose of this project was twofold: (1) to demonstrate an improved nondestructive inspection method for the <b>spindle</b> <b>threads</b> applicable to routine teardown maintenance, and (2) to determine the feasibility of performing safety-of-flight inspections on the spindle with only minimal disassembly. Recent projects funded by the Air Force have shown that the electric current perturbation (ECP) method is capable of detecting very small surface fatigue cracks in gas turbine engine disks 1 and second layer defects in relatively thick structural wing sections. 2 Based on these results, the ECP method was evaluated for its capability to inspect the <b>spindle</b> <b>thread</b> roots not only by scanning the outside diameter (crest of the threads), but also by scanning the hollow spindle bore under the threads and inspecting through the wall thickness for flight-critical cracks. With an ECP probe located on the crest of the threads, high sensitivity to very small defects in the thread roots was achieved and thumbnail shaped EDM slots as small as 0. 53 mm long by 0. 23 mm deep by 0. 064 mm wide were detected. Inspection from the bore requires only that the rotary wing be removed so that a probe can be inserted into the spindle bore. Since this inspection is performed through the spindle wall, sensitivity is reduced and only larger defects are detectable. From the bore, detection of a thumbnail shaped EDM slot measuring 7. 75 mm long by 2. 21 mm deep by 0. 102 mm wide was successfully demonstrated...|$|R
60|$|It was a rainy November afternoon. Dinner was over, {{the great}} wood fire {{had been made}} up, and Mistress Talbot was {{presiding}} over the womenfolk of her household and their tasks with needle and distaff. She had laid hands on her unwilling son Edward to show his father how well he could read the piece de resistance of the family, Fabyan's Chronicle; and the boy, with an elbow firmly planted {{on either side of}} the great folio, was floundering through the miseries of King Stephen's time; while Mr. Talbot, after smoothing the head of his largest hound for some minutes, had leant back in his chair and dropped asleep. Cicely's hand tardily drew out her <b>thread,</b> her <b>spindle</b> scarcely balanced itself on the floor, and her maiden meditation was in an inactive sort of way occupied with the sense of dulness after the summer excitements, and wonder whether her greatness were all a dream, and anything would happen to recall her once more to be a princess. The kitten at her feet took the spindle for a lazily moving creature, and thought herself fascinating it, so she stared hard, with only an occasional whisk of the end of her striped tail; and Mistress Susan was only kept awake by her anxiety to adapt Diccon's last year's jerkin to Ned's use.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the implantation of the nail and the system running, a cadaver study using both femora of four human cadavers was conducted. All experiments were approved and conducted {{in accordance with the}} guidelines of the Committee of Medical Ethics. Written informed consent from the donor was obtained prior to their inclusion in this study. Each cadaver was thoroughly checked, and none of the cadavers had a history of musculoskeletal disease that could have {{had an impact on the}} experiment. All cadavers were frozen to a temperature of − 18 ° Celsius exactly 48  h after death and defrosted for 24  h prior to the experiment. Implantation of the CDS was carried out in supine position using standard retrograde access though the knee joint. The femoral canal was reamed over a guide-wire to a diameter of 15.5  mm followed by temporary insertion of the nail. After removal of the nail, a bone defect was created via a medial approach in order to avoid major damage of the surrounding soft tissues of the femur. Forty-millimeter bone segments on the right femora and 60 -mm bone segments on the left femora were generated using a Gigli saw. The osteotomy was performed directly distal to the insertion of adductor brevis in such a way as to preserve as much of the periosteum as possible. The nail was then reinserted into the femoral canal across the bone segment to be transported and then locked proximally in an anteroposterior direction. Standard anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs were obtained to guide the nail to the correct position. Next, a 6.5 -mm lateral drill hole was generated on the bone segment followed by fixation of the bone segment on the <b>threaded</b> rod <b>spindle.</b> In order to perform distal locking of the nail, the femur had to be distracted on the side of the osteotomy as the tension force of the adherent soft tissues reduced the initial size of the bone defect. After the size of the bone defect was readjusted to a total length of 60  mm, distal locking was performed and the threaded rod was inserted into the nail. With the mechanism inserted into the nail, the traction wire was adjusted parallel to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and fixed to the tibial tuberosity using a cancellous bone screw (Fig.  6). At completion, the mechanism and the system were tested by flexing the knee joint. Radiographs were taken in AP and lateral direction in order to ensure correct bone segment transport (Fig.  7). Bone transport was then conducted in all eight femora until impingement of the bone segment at the docking site. In clinical application, the screw in the tibial tuberosity will be removed at the end of segment transport and the traction wire will be cut at the distal end of the nail leading to a retraction of the wire into the nail.|$|R
