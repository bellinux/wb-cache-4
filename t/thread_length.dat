Nearly 2. 5 million posts from over 18 thousand users were investigated. Scale free distributions were observed for activity in individual discussion threads as well as for overall activity. The number of unique users in a thread normalized by the <b>thread</b> <b>length</b> decays with <b>thread</b> <b>length,</b> suggesting that thread life is sustained by mutual discussions rather than by independent comments. Automatic sentiment analysis shows that most posts contain negative emotions and the most active users in individual threads express predominantly negative sentiments. It follows that the average emotion of longer threads is more negative and that threads can be sustained by negative comments. An agent based computer simulation model has been used to reproduce several essential characteristics of the analyzed system.

Usually, epidural catheters are placed without confirmation of their position despite frequent reports of complications {{as a result of}} malposition. In this study, we evaluated the <b>threading</b> <b>length</b> of thoracic epidural catheters without coiling and assessed the influence of two different epidural approach angles on the <b>threading</b> <b>length</b> without coiling. Methods. Eighty-three patients scheduled for thoracotomy were enrolled and randomly allo-cated into the acute angle group and the obtuse angle group. In both groups, skin insertion was performed at the T 8 – 9 intervertebra level. Epidural access was performed under fluoro-scopy using a paramedian approach at the T 7 – 8 level in the acute angle group and at the T 6 – 7 level in the obtuse angle group, and an end-hole 19 -gauge epidural catheter was inserted. Coiling length, defined as the length of the catheter within the epidural space when any part of the catheter just begins to head caudally, was measured in both groups. Results. The coiling length was 7. 4 (4. 4) cm (95 % CI 6. 0 – 8. 7 cm) in the obtuse angle group compared with 4. 9 (3. 3) cm (95 % CI 3. 8 – 6. 0 cm) in the acute angle group (P 0. 005). Conclusions. Approaching the thoracic epidural space with an obtuse approach angle provides longer coiling length.

However, their combined {{effect on the}} mussel's defence to its predator has been poorly understood, which hinders us to understand the prey–predator interaction in marine environment. The thick shell mussel Mytilus coruscus and its predator, the Asian paddle crab Charybdis japonica were exposed to three pH levels (7. 3, 7. 7, 8. 1) at two concentrations of dissolved oxygen (2. 0 mg L− 1, 6. 0 mg L− 1) seawater. The anti-predatory responses of mussels, in terms of byssus thread production were analyzed after 72 h exposure. During the experiment, frequency of shedding stalks (mussels shed their byssal stalks to release themselves from attachment and allow locomotion) and number of byssus threads increased with time, were significantly reduced by hypoxia and low pH levels, and some interactions among time, predator, DO and pH were observed. As expected, {{the presence of the}} crab induced an anti-predator response in M. coruscus (significant increases in most tested parameters except the byssus <b>thread</b> <b>length).</b> Acidification and hypoxia significantly reduced byssus thread diamter {{at the end of the}} experiment, but not the byssus <b>thread</b> <b>length.</b> Cumulative byssus <b>thread</b> <b>length</b> and volume were significantly impaired by hypoxia and acidification. Our results highlight the significance of anti-predatory responses for adult mussel M. coruscus even under a stressful environment in which stress occurs through ocean acidification and hypoxia. By decreasing the strength of byssus attachment, the chance of being dislodged and consumed by crabs is likely increased. Our data suggest that there are changes in byssus production induced by hypoxia and acidification, which may affect predation rates on M. coruscus in the field...|$|E

40|$|Sewability is very {{significant}} for industrial sewing machines and has received much attention and improvement. In this research, four on-line monitoring sensors are developed for industrial sewing machines {{in order to}} measure sewing parameters and help to detect sewability problems. Specifically, the developed sensors are <b>thread</b> <b>length</b> measurement sensor, thread tension sensor, thread tension setting sensor, and needle force sensor. These sensors can provide detailed information on thread consumption, instantaneous thread tension, thread tension setup, and needle penetration force. The <b>thread</b> <b>length</b> measurement sensor can measure the top <b>thread</b> <b>length</b> that goes into a given sew: According to the experimental results, it is found that this sensor can be used to set up the thread tension properly. Therefore, it can help to minimize the sewability problems. The thread tension sensor can measure the instantaneous thread tension during sewing stitches. Hence, it can detect an improper thread tension setup and help to minimize the sewability problems. However, its high cost limits its application. The thread tension setting sensor is then developed in order for sewing operators to set up the thread tension properly and quickly. It is also a cost-effective sensor that can provide data leading to solutions to the sewability problems. The needle force sensor can measure the instantaneous needle force during needle penetration and withdrawal. The new design of the sensor ensures that the measurements are more accurate than other measurement methods. This sensor can be used to help detect sewability problems resulting from an improper needle penetration force. In summary, the developed sensors can not only be used to measure the sewing parameters and help to detect the sewability problems, but they can also provide a data acquisition method for the automatic control of industrial sewing machines. With these sensors instrumented on industrial sewing machines, the sewability problems will be minimized. Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering.
