500|$|Due to [...] "protective and {{occasionally}} nervous" [...] fans, Kripke meant for Bela {{to be introduced}} in [...] "small doses". He wanted fans to know the show would always be just about Sam and Dean Winchester, and stated, [...] " [...] there for important plot elements, but it's not the Ruby and Bela show, nor {{is it about the}} four of them cruising around in the Impala together. It's about the guys." [...] However, he felt the writers pushed it too far in the episode [...] "Red Sky at Morning", stating his opinion that it [...] "was by far the least successful episode <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>because</b> it really kind of became the Bela show". The writers also did not take the time to consider how to tie her into the Winchesters' storylines. As Kripke pointed out, [...] "It's a road show and we're in a different town every week, so if you're going to run into the same character over and over again, you better have a damn good reason..." [...] They were eventually [...] "crushed {{under the weight of the}} absurdity of it" [...] because it became more difficult to justify her reappearances within the narrative. Another key problem stemmed from their conceptualization of her as an antagonistic character rather than a potential love interest for the brothers. The writers, [...] "so taken with a woman who could screw the boys over at every turn", ended up making Bela too antagonistic without establishing a balance. Any chance for a [...] "funny effervescent episode where they all work together" [...] was lost after the character attempts to have the Winchesters killed on multiple occasions. They eventually decided to drop the character from the series, opting to [...] "send her off in an appropriate and dramatic way" [...] which would [...] "show a couple of cards [...] been holding onto all season" [...] by revealing her backstory [...] "in a way that will surprise the audience and kind of tie her into the story." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ever {{since the}} 2nd century, some bishoprics {{in the eastern}} Roman Empire had counted years from the birth of Christ, {{but there was no}} {{agreement}} on the correct epoch – Clement of Alexandria (...) and Eusebius of Caesarea (...) wrote about these attempts. Because Dionysius did not place the Incarnation in an explicit year, competent scholars have deduced both AD1 and 1BC. The reason for his omission may be simply that the starting date was computationally convenient, or that he did not believe that the date of the Nativity could be pinpointed exactly. Ambiguities arise from the fact that eras may be either elapsed or current years, there are discrepancies in the lists of consuls, and there is disagreement as to whether the Incarnation should be reckoned from the Annunciation or the Nativity. Most scholars have selected 1BC (historians do not use a year zero), arguing that because the anniversary of the Incarnation was 25 March, which was near Easter, a year that was 525 years [...] "since the Incarnation" [...] implied that 525 whole years were completed near that Easter. Consequently, one year since the Incarnation would have meant 25 March 1, meaning that Dionysius placed the Incarnation on 25 March 1BC. Because the birth of Jesus was nine calendar months later, Dionysius implied, but never stated, that Jesus was born 25 December 1BC. Only one scholar, Georges Declerq (Declerq, 2002), thinks that Dionysius placed the Incarnation and Nativity in AD1, basing his conclusion on the structure of Dionysius's Easter tables. In either case, Dionysius ignored his predecessors, who usually placed the Nativity in the year we now label 2BC. In his 1605 thesis, the Polish historian Laurentius Suslyga was the first to suggest that Christ was actually born around 4 BC, deriving this from the chronology of Herod the Great, his son Philip the Tetrarch, and the daughter of Augustus, Julia. Having read Suslyga's work, Kepler noted that Christ was born during the reign of King Herod the Great (–), whose death he placed in 4BC. Kepler chose <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>because</b> Josephus stated that a lunar eclipse occurred shortly before Herod's death. John Pratt of the International Planetarium Society proposed the 29 December 1 BC eclipse as another eclipse. According to Josephus, Herod died in the year 4 or 3BC.|$|E
