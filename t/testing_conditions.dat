5|$|Unlike {{many other}} ants that use scent to forage for food, jack jumpers use their sight to target their prey. Like other bull ants, they are solitary when they forage, but only workers perform this role. These ants are omnivores and scavengers, {{typically}} foraging in warmer temperatures. They deliver painful stings, which {{are effective in}} both killing prey and deterring predators. Jack jumpers have smooth stingers, and can thus sting indefinitely. Jack jumper ants are skilled hunters, partially due to their excellent vision; they can even kill and devour wasps and bees. They also kill and eat other ants, such as carpenter ants (Camponotus) and feed on sweet floral secretions and other sugar solutions. Jack jumpers often hunt for spiders, and will sometimes follow their prey for a short distance, usually with small insects and small arthropods. Jack jumper ants, alongside M. simillima, have been given frozen houseflies (Musca domestica) and blowflies (Calliphoridae) as food under <b>testing</b> <b>conditions.</b> The ant has been observed to run and leap energetically at flies when they land, particularly on Acacia shrubs, plants or trees. Jack jumpers and other Myrmecia ants prey on insects such as cockroaches and crickets.|$|E

25|$|Herbal {{extracts}} as {{a source}} of compounds with an antiviral activity has attracted significant attention recently. Two researches independently published in 2016 screened a library of natural chemicals against FCV. The first one showed that Theaflavin and its derivatives but not Kaempferol significally inhibited entry of FCV into cells. On the contrary, authors of the second article claimed that kaempherol showed anti-FCV activity, but theaflavin treatment was insufficient. This striking difference may be (at least partially) explained by differences in <b>testing</b> <b>conditions.</b> Indeed, further studies of activity, as well as molecular mechanisms of action, needed.|$|E
25|$|As well as <b>testing</b> <b>conditions</b> {{during and}} after the monsoon, the {{expedition}} was to test likely climbers for 1936 and follow up the exploratory work of the 1921 reconnaissance. Explicitly there was to be no summit attempt and supplementary oxygen {{was not going to be}} used. Tilman initially regretted having to abandon the Nanda Devi summit attempt but Shipton persuaded him by the lightweight exploratory nature of what was being planned. Charles Warren and Edmund Wigram, both Cambridge medics, Edwin Kempson a Cambridge mathematician, and Dan Bryant, an ice climber from New Zealand agreed to take part. Shipton considered this complement quite ample but he found he had a surveyor, Michael Spender added to the team. Spender had made himself extremely unpopular on earlier expeditions due to his conceit and there were rumours that his inclusion was due to mischief making. All the same, Shipton and Spender became close friends.|$|E
25|$|The Special Casualty Access Team (SCAT) {{was first}} formed in 1986, {{from the need}} for {{paramedic}} ambulance officers {{to be able to}} provide high quality pre-hospital care to patients wherever they are. The Service currently has sixty SCAT officers throughout NSW. The roles of SCAT are many and varied including: medical support to the various rescue agencies, specialist police units (such as the State Protection Group) and fire brigades in Urban Search and Rescue / Hazmat; bushfires and urban search and rescue; working on Rescue and medical retrieval helicopters; and accessing and treating patients in caves, canyons, mines, and on cliff ledges. SCAT officers are self-sufficient and often ‘camp out’ with their patients when weather or operational conditions dictate a need to ‘stay put’ for a period (at times up to 24 hours without support). 'Core' SCAT skills focuses on safety and personal attributes (resilience, adaptability, teamwork & leadership) which is assessed under a range of <b>testing</b> <b>conditions</b> during an eight-week course.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} schedulability {{analysis}} problem for nonpreemptive scheduling algorithms on multiprocessors. To our best knowledge, {{the only known}} work on this problem is the <b>test</b> <b>condition</b> proposed by Baruah [1] (referred to as [BAREDF np]) for non-preemptive EDF scheduling, which will reject a task set with arbitrarily low utilization if it contains a task whose execution time is equal or greater than the minimal relative deadline among all tasks. In this paper, we firstly derive a linear-time <b>test</b> <b>condition</b> which avoids the problem mentioned above, by building upon the work in [2] for preemptive multiprocessor scheduling. This <b>test</b> <b>condition</b> works on not only non-preemptive EDF, but also any other work-conserving non-preemptive scheduling algorithms. Then we improve the analysis and present <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> of pseudo-polynomial timecomplexity for Non-preemptive Earliest Deadline First scheduling (EDF np) and Non-preemptive Fixed Priority scheduling (FP np) respectively.

40|$|Functional {{analysis}} <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> typically manipulate {{a single}} antecedent variable and an associated consequence to better isolate response–reinforcer relations. In some instances no problem behavior is observed, perhaps representing a false-negative finding. The present study evaluated one approach to assess potentially false-negative findings within functional analyses. Participants {{were exposed to}} single-antecedent functional analysis <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> and combined-antecedent <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> within a multielement design. Both participants engaged in problem behavior primarily during the combined-antecedent <b>test</b> <b>conditions,</b> and treatments matched to the results were effective in reducing problem behavior.

25|$|Pietersen {{played in}} the first Test against India {{and in the first}} innings, he made 37 but not without controversy. He edged the ball behind of Zaheer Khan to Dhoni. He walked, but after seeing replays on the screen, he walked back to the middle and the {{decision}} was overturned. Ironically, he was out shortly afterwards caught Dhoni, bowled Khan. In the second innings he was top scorer with a knock of 134 to set up a potential England victory. Pietersen described this as his best century, in very <b>testing</b> <b>conditions.</b> In the second test, he was twice lbw to RP Singh for 13 and 19 in a defeat which subsequently cost them the series. After making 41 in the first innings, Pietersen scored his 10th Test century in the third and final Test at the Oval, helping England to draw the game with 101. In the one-day series that followed, he struggled at the start with a top score of 33 not out in the first five matches of the series. He scored two half-centuries in the final matches including 71 not out in the final match at Lord's, hitting the winning runs to give England the series.|$|E

40|$|The {{injection}} of a plain jet of kerosene Jet A- 1 fuel into a crossflow of air was investigated experimentally regarding fuel placement, spray characteristics, and evaporation. The <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> chosen were {{a test case}} relevant to LPP (lean premixed prevaporized combustion) for gas turbines (pair= 15. 5 bar, Tair= 750 K) and the corresponding cold <b>test</b> <b>condition</b> in terms of air density (pair= 6 bar, Tair= 290 K). Both test cases were investigated in the absence {{as well as in}} the presence of a filmer plate on which part of the nascent fuel spray impinges. The nozzle diameter was 0. 45 mm and the fuel flowrate was 2. 94 g/s, so that the fuel-to-air momentum flux ratio q (q=(rliq*uliq 2) /(rair*uair 2)) assumed a value of 6. Measurement techniques employed include time-resolved shadowgraphs and Phase-Doppler-Anemometry (PDA). In the absence of the filmer plate, spray penetration is noticeably lower at the hot <b>test</b> <b>condition</b> than at the cold <b>test</b> <b>condition.</b> The presence of the plate causes the placement of the fuel to be better defined regardless of test case. Film formation on the plate and evidence of some sort of reflection of the fuel by the plate (e. g. splashing) were observed at both <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> At the cold <b>test</b> <b>condition,</b> the filmer plate leads to an overall finer spray.

Whatever intolerance, Hindu scholars displayed towards other religions was subtle and symbolic and most likely was done to present a superior argument in defence of their own faith. Traditionally, Hindus showed their intolerance by withdrawing and avoiding contact with those whom they held in contempt, instead of using violence and aggression to strike fear in their hearts. Hinduism is perhaps the only religion in the world which showed remarkable tolerance towards other religions in difficult times and under <b>testing</b> <b>conditions.</b> Even Buddhism, which spread in India mostly through negative campaigns against Hinduism, cannot claim that credit.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model {{was developed to}} provide additional insight {{and understanding of the}} factors that influence the simulation and prediction of leak rates from small cracks in pressurized containers. Specifically, the analysis was aimed at developing an {{analytical model}} capable of predicting the hydrogen leak rates from a crack in the combustion chamber coolant discharge manifold on main engine 1 of the Orbiter Challenger that was discovered during flight readiness firings 1 and 2. This model was based on viscous pipe flow analyses and calibrated for the crack geometry by using helium leak-rate data obtained from both low- and high-pressure tests used to simulate the flight readiness firing <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> In addition, this model includes the effects of crack width changes caused by different working stresses associated with the different <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> Because of the combination of the small crack dimensions and the wide range of pressures used for the <b>test</b> <b>conditions,</b> either laminar or turbulent viscous effects dominated the flows at all <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> This model was used to illustrate the sensitivity of the predicted leak rates to considerations of <b>test</b> <b>conditions,</b> viscous flow effects, and geometric features of the crack. In addition, the model was certified by comparing the hydrogen leak-rate prediction for the flight readiness firing <b>test</b> <b>condition</b> to the actual measured leak rate.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of {{manipulating}} target-word frequency rate and target-word phrase position on sound-meaning-connection in five to fifteen month old Swedish infants. Three different <b>test</b> <b>conditions,</b> each one of them a film showing objects and corresponding phrases made of randomly generated artificial words, were designed. The structure of the first, high variability <b>test</b> <b>condition</b> included context-dependent information and the structures of the second and the third, low variability <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> were characterised by frequent nonsense target-word rate, target-words occurring in phrase final position. The aim of the artificial input language was to ensure the novelty of test material, and to simulate the type of learning situation - when the semantic content of words is arbitrary - facing young infants in the beginning of language learning. Analysis of informants looking behaviour, prior to, and after exposure to the objects and the corresponding audio input, were performed. Results showed that the structure of high variability <b>test</b> <b>condition</b> and the structure of low variability <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> were associated with significant between-group differences. This finding indicates that the nonsense phrases in low variability <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> managed to 'explain' the objects just like semantically meaningful phrases do. When compared with past research, these findings seem to suggest that experience-dependent mechanisms may support, besides word segmentation, even more complicated aspects of language learning, such as acquisition of syntax.
