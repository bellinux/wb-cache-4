50|$|The drawbar system necessitated the {{implement}} {{having its}} own running gear (usually wheels) {{and in the}} case of a plow, chisel cultivator or harrow, some sort of lift mechanism to raise it out of the ground at turns or for transport. Drawbars necessarily posed a rollover risk depending on how the <b>tractive</b> <b>torque</b> was applied. The Fordson tractors (of which more units were produced and placed in service than any other farm tractor) was extremely prone to roll over backwards due to an excessively short wheelbase. The linkage between the implement and the tractor usually had some slack which could lead to jerky starts and greater wear and tear on the tractor and the equipment.|$|E
50|$|The Torsen {{differential}} {{works just}} like a conventional differential, but can lock up if a torque imbalance occurs, the maximum ratio of torque imbalance being defined by the Torque Bias Ratio (TBR). When a Torsen has a 3:1 TBR, that means that {{one side of the}} differential can handle up to 75% while the other side would have to only handle 25% of applied torque. During acceleration under asymmetric traction conditions, so long as the higher traction side can handle the higher percentage of applied torque, no relative wheelspin will occur. When the traction difference exceeds the TBR, the slower output side of the differential receives the <b>tractive</b> <b>torque</b> of the faster wheel multiplied by the TBR; any extra torque remaining from applied torque contributes to the angular acceleration of the faster output side of the differential.|$|E
50|$|When {{attempting}} to turn with a torque sensitive differential, the outer wheel {{will need to}} rotate quicker relative to the differential, and the inner wheel will rotate slower than the differential. Friction in the differential will oppose motion, and that will work to slow the faster side and speed up the slower/inner side. This leads to asymmetric torque distributions in drive wheels, matching the TBR. Cornering in this manner will reduce the torque applied to the outer tire, leading to possibly greater cornering power, unless the inner wheel is overpowered (which is easier to do than with an open differential). When the inner tire (which has less traction due to weight transfer from lateral acceleration) is overpowered, it angularly accelerates up to the outer wheel speed (small percent wheel spin) and the differential locks, and if the traction difference does not exceed the TBR, the outer wheel will then have a higher torque applied to it. If the traction difference exceeds the TBR, the outer tire gets the <b>tractive</b> <b>torque</b> of the inner wheel multiplied by the TBR, and the remaining applied torque to the differential contributes to wheel spin up.|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{developers}} of multi-wheeled vehicles (MWV) show {{growing interest in}} electromechanical drive in the «motor-axis» implementation. However, in designing the traction electric drive (TED) based on such approach the problems arise, primarily, {{from a lack of}} creating experience and of ready algorithmic solutions to control the traction motors. The use of methods to implement the individual TED is impossible {{because of the presence of}} cross-axle differential in the leading axle drive, which does not allow the input torque control of each wheel singly. The paper offers a law to control a traction electric drive of MWV leading axles that comprises the law to control the <b>tractive</b> effort <b>torque</b> and braking moment on the leading axles as well as algorithms of anti-lock brake and traction control systems. An analysis of simulation modeling results shows an efficiency of the developed law that allows control of the traction electric drive of MWV leading axles. The control law includes an algorithm to control the <b>tractive</b> effort <b>torque</b> and braking moment on the driving-wheels, as well as algorithms of anti-lock brake and traction systems. At stationary (constant speed rotation) and non-stationary (elk test) maneuvering there was no spin of vehicle wheels. Angular speeds of the wheels vary smoothly. Partial loss of vehicle stability when making maneuvers on ice may be reduced through development of algorithms for dynamic stabilization, which will improve the MWV road-holding and trajectory ability. Fullscale tests of MWV with traction electric drive implemented using a “motor-axis" approach are required to have a final answer on the performance and effectiveness of the developed control law. </p...|$|R
50|$|A tractor is an {{engineering}} vehicle {{specifically designed to}} deliver a high <b>tractive</b> effort (or <b>torque)</b> at slow speeds, {{for the purposes of}} hauling a trailer or machinery used in agriculture or construction. Most commonly, the term is used to describe a farm vehicle that provides the power and traction to mechanize agricultural tasks, especially (and originally) tillage, but nowadays a great variety of tasks. Agricultural implements may be towed behind or mounted on the tractor, and the tractor may also provide a source of power if the implement is mechanised.|$|R
40|$|The {{principles}} of Tribology {{are introduced to}} the general problem of tyre-soil interaction {{with a view to}} development of a better knowledge of {{the manner in which the}} tyre-soil interface behaves under rolling motion subjected to tractive force. In essence, an analytical model based on the finite element method is developed to evaluate the tyre-soil longitudinal slippage in connection with the <b>tractive</b> applied <b>torque.</b> The following major considerations are included in the proposed model: (1) A quasi-static finite element approach to cope with the actual dynamic behaviour of the tyre-soil interface. (2) Implementing the tyre tread effect in terms of an equivalent constrictive relationship for the entire contact patch. (3) Simulating the tyre motion effect on the subsoil media. The experimental program of this study has two main objectives: (1) Seeks verifications of the proposed analytical model. (2) Evaluates the tread effect on the general performance of pneumatic tyres moving on soft soil. The behaviour of the proposed model is presented in terms of the local variation of the longitudinal slip velocity, coefficient of friction, shear stress and developed relative displacement along the tyre-soil interface for different boundary conditions and for different interface features (buffed/treaded). The role of the tyre constant translational velocity is discussed and a linkage between the laboratory velocity and the actual field velocity is suggested. Finally, the applicability of the proposed model is demonstrated and the general practical usage is outlined...|$|R
40|$|Adhesion {{level for}} the proper running of rail {{wheelset}} on track is crucial problem in detecting slippage to avoid accidents. The slippage of rail wheels has been observed applying forward and lateral motions to slip velocity and torsion motion. The longitudinal and lateral forces behavior is watched with respect to traction force to note correlation based on angle of attack. The deriving torque relation with <b>tractive</b> <b>torque</b> is watched to check slippage. Coulomb’s law is applied in terms of tangential forces to normal forces owing to creep co-efficient and friction to know adhesion. Nadal’s limiting ratio is applied to escape from wheel climb and derailment from track depending upon wheel profile and flange on straight path and curves...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of improving the fuel efficiency by decreasing the engine speed during the coasting phase of the vehicle. The proposed approach is stimulated {{by the fact that}} the engine losses increase with the engine speed. If the engine speed is retained low, the engine losses will be reduced and subsequently the <b>tractive</b> <b>torque</b> will be increased, enabling the vehicle to remain moving for longer duration while coasting. By increasing the time period of the coasting the fuel efficiency can be increased, especially travelling downhill, since it can benefit from the kinematic energy stored in the vehicle to continue coasting for a longer duration. It is already industry standard practice to cut fuel during coasting and refuel at low engine speed. The substantial difference proposed in this paper is the controlled reduction of engine speed during this phase and thus reduction in the engine losses, resulting in improved fuel economy. The simulation model is tested and the results illustrating an improvement to the fuel efficiency through the proposed method are presented. Some results of the experimental tests with a real vehicle through the proposed strategy are also presented in the paper...|$|E
40|$|Magneto-hydrodynamics of couple stress {{lubricants}} in combined squeeze and shear {{in parallel}} annular disc viscous coupling systems M Daliri 1, D Jalali-Vahid 1 and H Rahnejat 2 This article presents predictive analysis of load-carrying capacity, tractive efficiency and response time of parallel annular discs intervened with {{a film of}} lubricant under combined shear and squeeze film motions. This configuration represents operational characteristics of viscous coupling systems. In particular, the case of viscous dampers for <b>tractive</b> <b>torque</b> generation and distribution in all-wheel-drive off road vehicles is studied. Various forms of lubricant behaviour, from idealised Newtonian to that of non-Newtonian silicone-based fluids and incompressible isothermal electrically conduct-ing couple stress fluids, subjected to a magneto-hydrodynamic field are studied. The solution for the magneto-hydrodynamics includes combined solution of modified Reynolds equation and Stoke’s micro-continuum for couple stress fluids in squeeze and shear with rotational fluid inertia, an approach not hitherto reported in the literature. It is shown that in general magneto-hydrodynamic couple stress fluids enhance the load-carrying capacity of the contact and inhibit the incidence of thin films, which can result in direct contact of surfaces. Rotational inertia decreases the load-carrying capacity, although in general the magneto-hydrodynamic fluids show better load-carrying capacity and tractive efficiency than the other alternatives. However, they exhibit a lower response time under the assumed isothermal condition. Nevertheless, the magneto-hydrodynamic fluids are best suited to applications in viscous coupling systems because of their controllability...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} uphill wood {{skidding}} with WOODY 110 skidder {{and the changes}} taking place in technical parameters: slip, <b>torque,</b> <b>tractive</b> forces, and weight distribution of a loaded tractor in the last three meters of skidding, which is defined as a range of stopping due to overload. The test was performed on a concave skid trail, where tractor loaded with 8 meter long fir logs stopped at the 32 % incline. It stopped somewhat later when skidding with butt-end forward in comparison to skidding with top-end forward. The loadweight with butt-end forward was 31. 69 kN, whereas with top-end forward itweighed 33. 53 kN. The measured speeds showed minute changes until the last meter, but decreased swiftly after stopping. Regarding some technical parameters, there were almost no changes at the end of stopping, two exceptions being the slip, which increased in the range of stopping, and the forward torque, which decreased in this range. The results showed that the hydrostatic transmission was efficient, considering that in a relatively well-controlled slip (the slip values increase only in the last three meters, which approximately equals the half of tractor's length) there was less grounddamage...|$|R
40|$|Applications of miniaturised robots in {{medicine}} have created significant opportunities for minimally invasive medicine. As {{a pioneer in}} such a field, wireless capsule endoscope (WCE) has brought significant advantages to the diagnosis of the gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, especially the symptoms in the small bowel to which a conventional endoscope is hard to reach. However, current commercial capsules depend on the natural peristalsis to move, which makes site-specific diagnosis and intervention less effective, limiting WCE’s prospect to a large degree. Therefore, substantial research is being dedicated to the active locomotion of WCEs, which is crucial for further therapeutic functionalities such as drug delivery and biopsy. This thesis reports on designing, optimising, fabricating, and testing locomotion mechanisms for a spiral-type robotic WCE for operation within the GI tract, especially in the small intestine, in a safe and reliable manner. The whole locomotion system functions by coupling a capsule robot containing a magnetic element via an external electromagnetic system. A three-axes circular Helmholtz coils has been employed to generate a rotating magnetic field to wirelessly provide actuation to the robotic capsule. By altering the frequency and amplitude of the electric current, this electromagnetic system is {{able to control the}} rotation speed and direction (in three dimensions) of the capsule. Biomechanical and biotribological properties of a real intestine were experimentally investigated in order to obtain a sound understanding of the working environment of the robotic capsule. Our findings demonstrate that the intestine’s biomechanical and biotribological properties are coupled, suggesting that the sliding friction is strongly related to the internal friction of the intestinal tissue. Sliding friction experiments were also conducted with bar-shaped solid samples to determine the sliding friction between the samples and the small intestine. Finite element analysis (FEA) has been used to optimise the geometry of a capsule robot assembled with spirals, like a screw assembled on its cylindrical surface. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been employed to investigate the interaction between the capsule and a mucus film rather than the intestinal wall. The CFD predictions agree well with the corresponding experiments in which the spiral-type capsules (i. e. the capsule robot with spiral traction elements) were actuated by the external electromagnetic system. The FEA is extended to take the deformation and viscoelasticity of the intestine into account in order to realistically predict the propulsion performance of the capsule robot, evaluated experimentally. The close correspondence between experimental and numerical results from the FEA has encouraged us to use the FEA as a tool to evaluate the performance of different helical structures and consequently, undertake the design and optimization of the traction topology of a spiral-type capsule robot. Most literature in this field shows qualitative results on the mechanical and dynamic behaviors of a spiral-type robotic WCE moving inside a model GI tract, rather than testing in a real small intestine. Very little was reported on the theoretical and experimental evaluation of various spiral-type capsule robots. In this thesis, significant efforts have been made to provide substantial experimental data for quantitatively analysing the performance of different traction topologies of the robotic capsule, including the resistive <b>torque,</b> <b>tractive</b> force, locomotion ability and locomotion efficiency, through in vitro experiments with real porcine small intestines. It is revealed that the optimisation of such a robotic capsule is a compromise among propulsion velocity, stability, efficiency, and safety as well. From this point of view, an optimised traction topology was identified and recommended from the performance evaluation based on the experimental data. By these findings, a significant step has been taken towards a functional robotic capsule with a swallowable size, {{and the development of a}} powerful therapeutical WCE eventually...|$|R
40|$|The {{realization}} of maximum adhesive forces for a railway vehicle {{is a very}} difficult process, because it involves using tractive efforts and depends on friction characteristics in the contact zone between wheels and rails. Tractive efforts are realized by means of tractive torques of motors, and their maximum values can provide negative effects such as slip and skid. These situations usually happen when information about friction conditions is lacking. The negative processes have a major influence on wearing of contact bodies and tractive units. Therefore, many existing control systems for vehicles use an effect of a prediction of a friction coefficient between wheels and rails because measuring a friction coefficient at the moment of running vehicle movement is very difficult. One of the ways to solve this task is to use noise spectrum analysis for friction coefficient detection. This noise phenomenon has not been clearly studied and analyzed. In this paper, we propose an adhesion control system of railway vehicles based on an observer, which allows one to determine the maximum <b>tractive</b> <b>torque</b> based on the optimal adhesive force between the wheels (wheel pair) of a railway vehicle and rails (rail track) depending on weight load from a wheel to a rail, friction conditions in the contact zone, a lateral displacement of wheel set and wheel sleep. As a result, it allows a railway vehicle to be driven in a tractive mode by the maximum adhesion force for real friction conditions...|$|E
