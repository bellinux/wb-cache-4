2500|$|The {{nature and}} purpose of <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> is a mystery.

This theory is now mostly abandoned, as <b>the</b> same <b>symbols</b> have been repeatedly found throughout the territory of the Vinča culture, in locations hundreds of kilometers and years away from each other. The prevailing theory is that <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> were used for religious purposes in a traditional agricultural society. If so, the fact that <b>the</b> same <b>symbols</b> were used for centuries with little change suggests that the ritual meaning and culture represented by <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> likewise remained constant for a very long time, with no need for further development. The use of <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> appears to have been abandoned (along with the objects on which they appear) at the start of the Bronze Age, suggesting that the new technology brought with it significant changes in social organization and beliefs.|$|R
