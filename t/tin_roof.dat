5|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} Olivier became {{increasingly}} involved in television work, a medium {{of which he}} was initially dismissive. In 1973 he provided the narration for a 26-episode documentary, The World at War, which chronicled the events of the Second World War, and won a second Emmy Award for Long Day's Journey into Night (1973). In 1975 he won another Emmy for Love Among the Ruins. The following year he appeared in adaptations of Tennessee Williams's Cat on a Hot <b>Tin</b> <b>Roof</b> and Harold Pinter's The Collection. In 1978 he appeared in the film The Boys from Brazil, playing the role of Ezra Lieberman, an ageing Nazi hunter; he received his eleventh Academy Award nomination. Although he did not win the Oscar, he was presented with an Honorary Award for his lifetime achievement.|$|E
5|$|The Erie Railroad was {{constructed}} through Sloatsburg from 1836 to 1841, {{helping with the}} prosperity of the village, along with its population. The station was also near the Sterlington one, but it never served of great importance. The Sloatsburg station building was built in 1868 as a two-story brick facade with a <b>tin</b> <b>roof.</b> The style of the building, according to the railroad's 1920 engineering report, is a Type 6A style, with dimensions of 17' x 29.5' x 19'. The station was equipped to host {{as a base for}} XG Radio from the Suffern Tower (SF) in Suffern. The Sloatsburg station served well for the nearby Greenwood Lake, with a stagecoach leaving the station three times day. The stagecoach was mainly inhabited by fishermen on their way to Greenwood Lake.|$|E

5|$|Western {{and central}} Europe were also {{impacted}} by damaging winds and downpours. The {{coast of the}} Netherlands endured high seas and gusts to 67mph (108km/h), uprooting trees and flooding the coastline. Rail services and flight operations were disrupted throughout the region. In Germany, gusts over 90mph (145km/h) were recorded at high elevations. In Stuttgart alone, 50vehicles were damaged by falling debris; downed trees, torn roofs, and power outages were common throughout the nation. In the capital of Munich, the storm destroyed a large <b>tin</b> <b>roof</b> measuring over 850sq ft (80sq m), parts of which impacted cars and fences on the ground. Damage from the incident was estimated at €500,000. Throughout Germany, the storm wrought €60–100 million in insured losses. A woman died in a traffic accident, attributed to wet road conditions, along the Bundesstraße 303 in the Bayreuth district. Northwesterly gales yielded a storm surge along the country's North Sea coastline, with tides running over 7ft (2m) above normal along the Elbe River at Hamburg. Neighboring Austria and Switzerland also experienced gales and power outages. A tornado touched down near Neukirchen an der Enknach in Austria, damaging homes and farms. Gusts in southern Switzerland reached , leading to road and rail closures. In southern France, the system initiated a mistral wind event.|$|E

50|$|During {{the early}} 1940s, {{recordings}} {{were done in}} quiet parks and gardens after midnight because the studios did not have sound-proof recording rooms.

25|$|The {{original}} shed was {{a rickety}} wooden structure with walls of Kentish weatherboarding and a <b>tin</b> <b>roof.</b> It fell into hopeless disrepair {{and was replaced}} in stages with a more substantial structure in corrugated asbestos with five brick smoke vents which was finished in 1937. This was pulled down by British Railways at an unknown date by 1953.|$|E

25|$|The French {{troops who}} {{occupied}} Moscow in 1812 used {{the church for}} stables and looted anything worth taking. The church was spared by the Fire of Moscow (1812) that razed Kitai-gorod, and by the troops' failure to blow it up according to Napoleon's order. The interiors were repaired in 1813, and the exterior in 1816. Instead of replacing missing ceramic tiles of the main tent, the Church preferred to simply cover it with a <b>tin</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
25|$|From 19551957, Hall ran the Arts Theatre in London {{where he}} {{directed}} the English-language premiere of Waiting for Godot in 1955.

Other productions at The Arts included the English language premiere of The Waltz of the Toreadors by Jean Anouilh.|$|E

25|$|Heymann {{says most}} of the rooms are {{relatively}} small and have high ceilings. The living-family room and the kitchen-dining room in the east end of the house are large, laid out for frequent entertaining and family gatherings. The living room has a series of glass picture doors. The <b>tin</b> <b>roof</b> of the house extends beyond the porch. When it rains, it’s possible to sit on the patio and watch the water pour down without getting wet. Under a gravel border around the house, a concrete gutter channels the water into the cistern for irrigation. In hot weather, a terrace directly above the cistern is a little cooler than the surrounding area.|$|E
25|$|Fargo {{offers a}} wide variety of {{cultural}} opportunities for a city of its size. This is likely due, in part, to the presence of three universities in the area. Most theatre and events are either promoted or produced by the universities, although there are several private theatre companies in the city including Fargo-Moorhead Community Theatre (FMCT), Theatre 'B' in downtown Fargo, Ursa Major Productions, Music Theatre Fargo Moorhead, <b>Tin</b> <b>Roof</b> Theatre Company, The Entertainment Company and others. Music organizations in the area include the Fargo-Moorhead Opera, the Fargo-Moorhead Symphony Orchestra, and the Fargo-Moorhead Youth Symphony.

25|$|Sporadic flights with {{seaplanes}} to Ålesund {{started in}} 1920, although not {{with more than}} a few private flights per year. From November 1929 the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service set up a base at Skutvika near the town center, which they used to search for herring. This base was found to be unsuitable due to the amount of ship traffic. When they returned the following year, the Herring Association had instead selected a more suitable base at Nørvevika. There they established at wooden shed with a <b>tin</b> <b>roof</b> which acted as a hangar for two Hansa-Brandenburg W.33 aircraft. Due to harsh treatment the winter weather gave the aircraft, the air service terminated these operations the following year.|$|E
25|$|Newman's {{first film}} for Hollywood was The Silver Chalice (1954). The film was a box office failure and the actor would later {{acknowledge}} his disdain for it. In 1956, Newman garnered much attention and acclaim {{for the role}} of Rocky Graziano in Somebody Up There Likes Me. In 1958, he starred in Cat on a Hot <b>Tin</b> <b>Roof</b> (1958), opposite Elizabeth Taylor. The film was a box office smash and Newman garnered his first Academy Award nomination. Also in 1958, Newman starred in The Long, Hot Summer with Joanne Woodward, with whom he reconnected on the set in 1957 (they had first met in 1953). He won Best Actor at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival for this film.|$|E
500|$|Orson Welles as Will Varner. The {{character}} {{was inspired by}} Big Daddy Pollitt from Tennessee Williams' play Cat on a Hot <b>Tin</b> <b>Roof.</b> Welles' presence on the film was marked by multiple conflicts with director Martin Ritt. He agreed to take the role due to a tax debt of US$150,000; he stated years later, [...] "I hated making Long Hot Summer. I've seldom been as unhappy in a picture".|$|E
50|$|After the {{turnover}} to the VNAF the base was largely abandoned. It was, quite simply, much {{too big for}} the Vietnamese to use. The base was slowly looted for its usable equipment, such as air conditioners, desks, refrigerators, and other furniture along with windows, doors and corrugated <b>tin</b> <b>roofs</b> from the buildings left by the Americans, leaving what could be categorized as a deteriorating ghost town of abandoned buildings.|$|R
50|$|Another {{reason was}} {{that they did not}} see any serious effort in real social development, only some {{subsidies}} for cement, <b>tin</b> <b>roofs,</b> chickens, and crops. They suspected that the state of Chiapas and the European Union had hidden interests in the region, and a certain kind of relationschip with its inhabitants. Like previous projects in the region, Prodesis was seen as a counter-insurgency project, designed to divide and rule.|$|R
