Generally, the power plant system and control design mean highly complex interactivities. The dynamic simulation models using powerful computers are effective tools for studying and understanding the operating characteristics of power plants to meet and improve the design, control strategy and operational requirements.

40|$|The <b>turbine</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>system</b> (TBS) {{provides}} {{operational flexibility}} {{so that the}} plant may accept certain load changes without disturbing the nuclear steam supply system. The TBS is designed to discharge a stated percentage of rated main steam flow directly to the main condensers, bypassing the turbine. This steam bypass enables the plant to take step load reductions up to the TBS capacity without the reactor or turbine tripping. The system is also used during startup and shutdown to control reactor pressure for a boiling water reactor (BWR) and steam generator pressure for a pressurized water reactor (PWR). The TBS is not required for safe shutdown as the relief and safety valves are operated under emergency conditions. The system {{is not required to}} function as a heat sink for the prevention or mitigation of postulated accidents. Failure of the TBS during a load reduction or turbine trip would result in the actuation of the relief valves and possibly the safety valves.

5000|$|Sequential {{turbocharger}} systems {{provide a}} way to decrease turbo lag without compromising ultimate boost output and engine power. Perhaps the most noteworthy application of this system is the fourth-generation Toyota Supra (1993-1998), which is generally regarded as having the most reliable sequential turbo system yet fitted to a production automobile, with a reported failure rate of less than 1% as of 2011. Other examples of cars with a sequential twin-turbo setup include the 1986-1988 Porsche 959, the 1990-1995 Eunos Cosmo JC, 1992-2002 Mazda RX-7 FD3S Turbo (13B-REW engine), the 1994-2005 JDM Subaru Legacy GT, GT-B & B4 RSK (EJ20TT engine), and the Peugeot 407 2.2 HDi. GM has filed a patent for a sequential twin-turbo system that uses a new bypass valve design said to optimize exhaust flow to the turbines of both turbochargers. [...] According to the 2016 patent description, the exhaust manifold features two outlets with one directing exhaust gases to the turbine of the high-pressure turbocharger, while the second exhaust manifold outlet directs exhaust gases to the turbine of the low-pressure turbocharger via a connecting channel. Additionally, exhaust gas exiting the high-pressure turbine is directed to the inlet of the low-pressure <b>turbine.</b> The new <b>bypass</b> <b>system</b> features two throttle valves located on the same spindle mounted perpendicular to each other. With the throttle valves mounted on the same plane, one valve opens to direct exhaust gas flow {{to one of the}} turbochargers while the other valves simultaneously blocks exhaust gas flow to the other turbocharger. The vehicle ECU (electronic control unit) sends a signal to the spindle’s actuator to rotate the throttle valves based on rpm and load. GM says the new design allows engineers to optimize exhaust gas flow to both turbines without the compromises of traditional sequential turbocharger systems. Additionally, the system could utilize a variable-geometry turbine or a fixed-geometry turbine on the high-pressure turbo.|$|R

Yearling and subyearling Chinook salmon and yearling coho salmon O. kisutch released into the <b>bypass</b> <b>system</b> were injured or descaled. Also, levels of blood plasma cortisol and lactate were significantly higher in yearling and subyearling Chinook salmon that passed through the <b>bypass</b> <b>system</b> than in fish released directly into a net located over the bypass exit.

Based on studies conducted from 1999 to 2001, the new <b>bypass</b> <b>system</b> resulted in high fish survival, virtually no injuries to fish, fish passage times that were generally similar to water travel times, and mild stress responses from which fish recovered quickly.

The effect of the gap (between the fuel pellet and clad) conductance modeling, <b>turbine</b> <b>bypass</b> fractions, and initial core flow rates are evaluated [...] Two limiting values of gas-gap conductance, the lowest value of 5, 000 W/m 2 -K at BOC and the highest value of 161, 000 W/m 2 -K at PHE, are compared with corresponding base cases which utilized the dynamic gas-gap model. <b>Turbine</b> <b>bypass</b> fractions analyzed are 10 % and 25 % at PHE and these two sensitivity cases are compared with the 100 % bypass base case.

The simulations were carried out using the TRACE/PARCS code system and models developed for a previous study at three different times during a fuel cycle with all relevant BWR/ 5 systems. The modeling in the core is particularly detailed (four fuel rod types included in each fuel assembly and 382 thermal-hydraulic channels to represent all assemblies taking into account half-core symmetry) in order to capture the complex neutronic-thermal-hydraulic coupling during periods of instability.

40|$|Recent {{decline of}} Pacific lamprey Lampetra tridentata adult {{migrants}} to the Snake River drainage has {{focused attention on}} the species. Adult returns in 1995 - 1999 were more than ten magnitudes less than returns in the early 1960 's. Human activities in the Snake River and Clearwater River drainages have altered ecosystem habitat in the last 100 years and likely the productive potential of Pacific lamprey habitat. Logging, stream impoundment, road construction, grazing, mining, and community development have dominated habitat alteration in the Clearwater River system and Snake River corridor. Hydroelectric projects in the Snake River corridor impact juvenile Pacific lamprey outmigrants and returning adults. Juvenile lamprey outmigrants potentially pass through <b>turbines,</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>bypass</b> and collection <b>systems,</b> and spillway structures at lower Snake River hydroelectric dams. Clearwater River drainage hydroelectric facilities including the Pacific Power and Light Dam on the Clearwater River in Lewiston, Idaho, impacted Pacific lamprey populations, however, the degree of impact is unknown (1920 's-early 1970 's). Hydroelectric dam construction (Harpster Dam) on the South Fork of the Clearwater River resulted in obstructed salmonid passage in the mid- 1900 's. Habitat alterations in the Snake River basin and Clearwater River drainage have had numerous negative effects on salmon Oncorhynchus spp. and steelhead trout O. mykiss populations (wild fish), but the magnitude of impacts on lamprey productivity and survival is unknown. Thorough understanding of Pacific lamprey habitat use and life history processes is needed to facilitate management and restoration of the species. Through Bonneville Power Administration support, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game began investigation into the status of Pacific lamprey populations in Idaho's Clearwater River drainage in 2000. Trapping, electrofishing, and spawning ground redd surveys {{were used to determine}} where Pacific lamprey persist in the South Fork of the Clearwater River drainage.
