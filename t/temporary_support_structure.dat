Paxson, Acting State Bridge Engineer while McCullough took {{a leave of absence}} to work on {{projects}} in Central America, was the supervising engineer during construction. The resident engineer was Raymond Archibald until 1935, when he joined McCullough, then Dexter R. Smith. The Northwest Roads Company of Portland, Oregon built the piers and the concrete structure. The steel sections of the bridge were built by the Virginia Bridge and Iron Company. The main piers are supported on piles driven into the bay's bed. The main towers of the cantilever section were fabricated off-site and moved to the bridge site in four sections. Work on the cantilever arms moved out in both directions from the tower, with the shoreward arm keeping slightly ahead of the center arm so that it would rest on a <b>temporary</b> <b>support</b> <b>structure</b> to stabilize the bridge. The concrete arch sections were erected using timber falsework. The bridge opened in June 1936.|$|E
40|$|Slide-in Bridge Construction (SIBC) is {{different}} from the conventional bridge construction because of the activity required to move the bridge to final position following construction. Moving activity requires bridge to be on a <b>temporary</b> <b>support</b> <b>structure,</b> resting on a sliding system such as bearings suitable for sliding, and a system of force actuation for pushing or pulling the bridge. Two SIBC projects were recently completed in Michigan, USA. SIBC being new to the bridge community, substructure forces that are developed during slides are best estimated. Hence, one of the Michigan projects was selected and slide operation was simulated using dynamic explicit finite element analysis techniques. This article presents use of dynamic explicit finite element analysis for evaluating temporary substructure forces during bridge slide. Further the analysis results are used to explain the impact of unequal friction at sliding surfaces and differential alignment of the temporary supports on substructure forces and bridge superstructure movement. Typically, bridge superstructures are slid in place using forcecontrolled systems. Analysis was performed using force-controlled and displacement-controlled methods. Then, the analysis results are used to explain the benefits of using displacement-controlled methods with force monitoring to slide a bridge rather than employing a force-controlled method...|$|E

Predicted values are available for two periods during construction, received from the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. The numerically predicted stage one follows the tendency found from the measurements, while the numerically predicted second building stage shows significant deviation from the observed tendency. The last mode of interest in the experimental data appears at a lower frequency than the numerically predicted mode. The damping estimates are more scattered. The predicted damping ratio appears to be non-conservative for the investigated wind loading. Modal parameters obtained from a more extensive dataset will contribute to updates of analytical models, increase knowledge and contribute to the safety during construction stage under more challenging conditions...|$|E

40|$|Tunnel {{excavation}} in cohesionless soils {{implies the}} use of a <b>temporary</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>structure</b> prior to lining installation. This temporary structure has to couple safety and economy, and can be conveniently realized using ground improvement techniques (for instance, by creating an arch of partially overlapped sub-horizontal jet grouted columns). The adoption of ground improvement techniques results into structures far from having a perfect shape because intrinsically affected by defects (in both geometrical and mechanical characteristics), and therefore their design may hide unforeseen risks. As a consequence, this is the typical case in which sophisticated numerical analyses may just give the illusion of being refined, if possible defects are not correctly taken into account. In this paper a simple yet rational analytical method for the design of non-closed tunnel <b>supporting</b> <b>structure</b> that may be of some help to this aim is presented. It is done with reference to a simple 2 D scheme. In {{the first part of the}} paper, a design chart to design an optimal shape and minimum structural thickness of the cross section of the <b>supporting</b> <b>structure</b> is shown. In the second part, an iterative procedure to verify the stability or to design the minimum structural thickness of an existing <b>supporting</b> <b>structure</b> with a predefined shape is described. This method, coupled with the analysis of structural demand, allows in principle to plot design charts. This approach can easily take into account structural defects with a semi probabilistic approach and therefore with a chosen risk level, being of great help for the designer at least in a preliminary design stage. The proposed semi probabilistic procedure is applied to the case of a <b>temporary</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>structure</b> realized by partially overlapped sub horizontal jet grouted columns, intrinsically affected by defects in diameter and position. The variability of these geometrical parameters was considered based on the large experimental evidence collected in field trials by the authors and published elsewhere.

40|$|Shell {{structures}} are expensive structures {{due to their}} extensive construction time and costs making them unpopular {{in spite of their}} material and structural efficiency. <b>Temporary</b> <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> are now based on the weight of the structure without taking into account what the incomplete structure can carry by itself. Structural characteristics of shell structures and modern computational methods do provide a solid platform to optimize the construction procedure of these nature adaptive and esthetically pleasing structures. This would save time and money through exclusion of set up time, reduced scaffolding costs and enabling of simultaneous construction phasing (building under the roof while the roof is being build). Recent research into historical and newly available methods has unveiled methods to nearly exclude the use of <b>temporary</b> <b>support.</b> However, these methods have not been tested on large scale designs and do not prove to be fit for up scaling. In the last five years structural patterning and the influence of a panel pattern on force flow have also come up as a research field for building construction. A combination of features found in past methods and recent research can be joined into an improved modern construction method. To know the minimal amount of <b>supports</b> needed the <b>structure</b> will need to be monitored every step of the construction process. Simultaneously it will have to find the best panel to put in next. To retrieve this information from the ground up, every panel that can possibly be installed will need to be tested. On large scale projects this will be a time costly process. That is why Ir. P. Eigenraam and Msc. S. Luitse have developed their own method: Deconstruction and reversed Deconstruction. Deconstruction is the initial analysis method that works from the top, the complete assembled structure, down. Based on a finite element analysis (FEA) at each iteration it finds the least stressed panel and removes it. This can be compared to finding the loosest block in Jenga. This will continue until the structure is fully deconstructed. This will provide a reversed construction order {{that can be used to}} construct the structure with the least amount of stress and deformation. This construction method is called reversed Deconstruction. Although the deconstruction algorithm is still under development first analysis show up to 75 % reductions of <b>temporary</b> <b>supports</b> during construction. Further reductions can be done by preassembling parts of the structure. This report will research the possibilities of this analysis and construction method. A historical review of shell construction methods combined with research into force flow through complex free form prefabricated shell structures will provide the pointers and tools. Along these pointers and tools the Deconstruction analysis method will be set up. The method is tested through FEA and concluded upon. It is the search for a smart construction method.

40|$|Direction of {{the nearby}} maximum {{principal}} stresses and the mass weathering of the surrounding geology have been accepted {{as some of the}} most significant factors in the design of underground excavations and structures. However, presence and exact location of localized fault/shear zones is extremely difficult to determine by conventional ground investigation techniques. More often than not, the effect of the fault/shear zones is not fully realized until they become exposed by the actual excavation. Thus, this case study was set out to determine whether the orientation of fault/shear zones can be accurately predicted based on hydraulic fracturing tests carried out in the vicinity. Detailed geological information had been gathered from mapping records which were carried out during the excavation and construction of the MTRC Kwun Tong Line Extension (KTE) project. Based on the mapping data, 17 as-encountered and inferred fault/shear zones, and the corresponding <b>temporary</b> <b>support</b> and permanent <b>structures,</b> along the KTE alignment were carefully examined. The degree of <b>temporary</b> <b>support</b> and reinforced concrete lining were, respectively, found inversely proportional to the rock mass quality in terms of Q-value and the presence of completely weathered material in the tunnel crown. The orientations of the inferred fault/shear zones examined in this study agreed with the direction of the maximum principal stresses measured from hydraulic fracturing tests carried out in the vicinity. The findings of this case study suggest that orientations of fault/shear zones can in fact be predicted and mitigation measures may be prepared before the effect of fault/shear zones becomes fully manifested. published_or_final_versionApplied GeosciencesMasterMaster of Scienc...|$|R

40|$|Shoring {{systems are}} used as <b>temporary</b> <b>support</b> for <b>structures</b> under {{construction}} and their primary function is to support and transmit various types of loads. To optimize this phase it has been developed a technique known as Clearing or partial Striking; it consists in removing a percentage of shores {{few days after the}} casting such that the load is redistributed between the slab and the remaining shores. In this way the shores removed in one floor can be used to start building the upper one. It is thus really important to conceive the process in a proper way assuring that the whole system is able to support the loads acting on it. This is the reason for which there is a prudent need to understand which conditions lead to the collapse of shoring systems and what measures can impounded in the design process to mitigate the risk of failure. The aim of this thesis is to perform a progressive collapse analysis, during the construction phase of the building, by instantly removing one or several primary load bearing elements and analyzing the structure’s remaining capability to absorb the damage. The analysis have been performed varying load conditions and slab thicknesses and, once the results from standard shores cases have been obtained, calculations with load limiters have been performed. The entire study has been developed with finite elements by means of ANSYS APDL starting from a FE model developed by Alvarado (2010).

40|$|Young {{trees were}} {{harvested}} to explore non-destructive methodologies to estimate live branch dry weights in young fast-growing Eucalyptus species under different spacing and fertilizer treatments. Branch growth can vary with silvicultural management such as spacing, fertilizing and thinning, and over relatively short periods {{in response to}} environmental conditions. Many published regressions based on standard measurements of height and diameter are site, age and treatment specific. The {{aim of this study}} was to improve our capacity to predict woody crown dry weight, based on stem measurements, and to minimize (or eliminate) treatment effects on the resulting model. In young trees, branches are <b>temporary</b> <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> for foliage and are often discarded as the base of the green crown rises. As temporary structures they represent an investment of biomass and nutrient elements, and are subject to selection pressures to maximize the return on investment by the tree. Trees were harvested from existing plantation experiments located in south-eastern Queensland for E. grandis W. Hill ex Maiden (ranging from 0. 28 to 15. 85 m in height, to 5 years old) and south-western Australia for E. globulus Labill. (0. 10 – 34. 4 m in height, to 10. 2 years) in order to examine the impact of spacing, nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization on early growth. Relationships to estimate crown woody biomass from non-destructive measurements were developed, and these relationships tended to have different slopes and intercepts for trees with predominantly juvenile foliage and those with intermediate or adult foliage. Dry weight of whole-crown live branch wood (Wbranch) was related to heights and/or diameter at breast height (DBH), but the regressions parameters were different, depending on treatment. The relationships became more generic (i. e. less dependent on treatment effects) between Wbranch and stem sectional area at the height of the base of the green crown (SACB), consistent with the pipe model theory (R 2 3 ̆e 0. 91 for the two species for trees with intermediate/adult leaves). However, Wbranch was more closely related again to the stem volume above the base of the green crown and treatment effects were not significant (VCon,gc, R 2 3 ̆e 0. 93). Branches exit the stem below the green crown, and for E. grandis the best relationship was on stem volume above the lowest live branch (VCon,llb, R 2 0. 94). Limited sampling from four other species with similar or contrasting crown characteristics indicated that the relationship could be applied quite generally. Individual E. grandis branch woody dry weight was closely related to the conical volume of the main (first order) branch (Vcon,br, R 2 0. 98). The whole crown equivalent, branch woody dry weight plus stem dry weight above the lowest live branch, was also closely related to the stem volume within the woody crown (VCon,llb, R 2 0. 97 – 0. 99). While the slope of this relationship was still significantly different between trees with juvenile and intermediate/adult foliage, it had a similar form, suggesting that trees with juvenile foliage allocated a different proportion of their woody biomass within the crown to branches than older trees...|$|R

The interlinking of the <b>temporary</b> <b>support</b> units with mesh or safety netting has been explored in the prevention of falls of ground between support units during gravity driven falls of ground. These tests illustrate the facility’s ability to be used to stimulate innovative thinking and provide a testing ground for the development of <b>temporary</b> <b>support</b> systems {{in order to reduce the}} risk of fall of ground injury to mining personnel at the stope face...|$|R
