As the fuel cell output is very low we {{are in need of}} a step up dc-dc converter. Here a current fed dc-dc converter is used. Two current fed dc-dc converters are interleaved by connecting their inputs in parallel and outputs in series. With this proposed methodology input current ripples in the fuel cell stacks can be reduced and a regulated output voltage ripples can be obtained. The active clamping circuit used in this model absorbs the <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> <b>voltage</b> spikes hence low voltage devices with low on state resistance can be used. Voltage doubler circuits will give double the output voltage than normal with smaller transformer turns ratio and flexibility.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} forces acting at {{the surface}} of an oscillating quartz crystal, which is in contact with a tip, were studied using the "ring-down" method. The resonator is excited at its resonance frequency and then decays freely after the AC driving <b>voltage</b> is <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b> The <b>voltage</b> across the electrodes during the decay {{is proportional to the}} time-dependent shear strain inside the plate. Non-sinusoidal components of the oscillation are directly visualized. For statistical analysis we mostly rely on the amplitudes of anharmonic overtones as determined with a Fourier analysis. These amplitudes display a maximum when the tip just barely touches the oscillating surface. Even overtones indicate the presence of normal forces. The occurrence of these normal stresses is attributed to adhesion hysteresis in the rim of the contact area. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{low-power}} 32 bit × 32 bit multiplier with pipelined block-wise shutdown scheme. When it idles, it <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> supply <b>voltage</b> to reduce both dynamic and static power. Restoring whole large-size functional block often causes severe power line noise, so the proposed multiplier shutdowns and wakes up sequentially along with pipeline stage. It {{is described in}} Verilog HDL and fabricated in standard cell library. Total gate count is about 22400 gates. Power simulation was performed in deep submicron technologies where static power due to leakage current increases significantly. In idle mode, the proposed multiplier consumes 0. 013 mW and 0. 006 mW in 0. 13 μm and 0. 09 μm technologies, respectively, and it reduces power consumption to 0. 07 %~ 0. 08 % of active mode. As fabrication technology becomes small, power efficiency degrades in the conventional clock gating scheme, but the proposed multiplier does not. The low-power design methodology in this paper can be easily adopted in most functional blocks with pipeline architecture. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Reducing {{the supply}} voltage to reduce dynamic power {{consumption}} in CMOS devices, inadvertently will lead to an exponential increase in leakage power dissipation. In this work we explore an architectural idea to reduce leakage power in data caches. Previous work has shown that cache frames are “dead ” for a significant fraction of time [14]. We are exploiting this observation to <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> cache lines that {{are not likely to}} be accessed anymore. Our method is simple: if a cacheline is not accessed within a fixed interval (called decay interval) we <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> its supply <b>voltage</b> using a gated V dd technique introduced previously [1]. We study the effect of cache-line decay on both power consumption and performance. We find that it is possible with cache-line decay to build larger caches that dissipate less leakage power than smaller caches while yielding equal or better performance (fewer misses). In addition, because our method can dynamically trade performance for leakage power it can be adjusted according to the requirements of the application and/or the environment. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} an active-clamped soft-switched forward converter without output filter. Differently {{from the}} topology presented in [G.

This solution avoids {{the use of a}} second inductor and auxiliary diodes and allows a better exploitation of the converter components, since now both the main and the auxiliary switch turn on at zero voltage and zero current, and they <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> at zero <b>voltage</b> by using a loss-less capacitor. The resulting topology is practically identical to that of an active-clamped flyback converter, except for the reversed transformer secondary side polarity. Thus, in addition to the converter analysis, the paper presents a comparison between the proposed converter and the active-clamped flyback converter, by testing two prototypes rated for 48 W output power...|$|R

However, this phenomenon does not occur in the other two devices. The reverse bias would take the captured carriers out of the trapping sites, and then the trapped carriers will make less contribution to EL intensity. So, we infer that trap-assisted recombination probably consists in devices fabricated by CBP-doped Ir(MDQ) 2 (acac) or Ir(ppy) 3 due to the existence of the trapped charges [27].|$|R

50|$|A lot of {{research}} has been done on the dynamic power reduction with the use of DVFS techniques. However, as technology continues to shrink, leakage power will become a dominant factor. Power gating is a commonly used circuit technique to remove leakage by <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> the supply <b>voltage</b> of unused circuits. Power gating incurs energy overhead; therefore, unused circuits need to remain idle long enough to compensate this overheads.A novel micro-architectural technique for run-time power-gating caches of GPUs saves leakage energy. Based on experiments on 16 different GPU workloads, the average energy savings achieved by the proposed technique is 54%.Shaders are the most power hungry component of a GPU, a predictive shader shut down power gating technique achieves up to 46% leakage reduction on shader processors.The Predictive Shader Shutdown technique exploits workload variation across frames to eliminate leakage in shader clusters. Another technique called Deferred Geometry Pipeline seeks to minimize leakage in fixed-function geometry units by utilizing an imbalance between geometry and fragment computation across batches which removes up to 57% of the leakage in the fixed-function geometry units. A simple time-out power gating method can be applied to non-shader execution units which eliminates 83.3% of the leakage in non-shader execution units on average.All the three techniques stated above incur negligible performance degradation, less than 1%.|$|R

The converter utilizes two-stage switched-capacitors as voltage sources {{to extend the}} voltage gain and auto-balance two branches current. Besides, the voltage stress on the main switches is reduced further due to the voltage distributed on the switched-capacitors.

The main switches are <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> under zero <b>voltage</b> switching(ZVS) condition because of a passive clamp circuit and turned on under zero current switching (ZCS) condition due to the coupled inductor inherent leakage.

Then, the operating principle and performance of the converter are discussed in detail.

Due to the nature of these applications, the concentrator must be able to operate under real-world conditions, and be robust to particulates and variations in solution conductivity. The concentrator is an active filter, which concentrate bacteria in solution using negative dielectrophoresis, which pushes objects away from the electrodes toward field minima.

40|$|Deep-submicron CMOS designs {{maintain}} high transistor switching speeds by {{scaling down}} the supply voltage and proportionately reducing the transistor threshold voltage. Lowering the threshold voltage increases leakage energy dissipation due to subthreshold leakage current {{even when the}} transistor is not switching. Estimates suggest a five-fold increase in leakage energy in every future generation. In modern microarchitectures, much of the leakage energy is dissipated in large on-chip cache memory structures with high transistor densities. While cache utilization varies both within and across applications, modern cache designs are fixed in size resulting in transistor leakage inefficiencies. This paper explores an integrated architectural and circuit-level approach to reducing leakage energy in instruction caches (icaches). At the architecture level, we propose the Dynamically ResIzable i-cache (DRI i-cache), a novel i-cache design that dynamically resizes and adapts to an application’s required size.

Compared to a conventional i-cache using an aggressively-scaled threshold voltage a 64 K DRI i-cache reduces on average both the leakage energy-delay product and cache size by 62 %, with less than 4 % impact on execution time.
