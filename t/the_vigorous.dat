5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 8th century, patronage to Shaivism increased in every section of the society; the landed elite, landlords, assemblies (samaya), schools of learning (aghraharas) and minor ruling families such as the Bana, Nolamba and Chalukya clans. The Shaiva temples contained a Shiva linga (phallus) in the sanctum sanctorum along with images of the mother goddess, Surya (Sun god) and Nandi (a bull and attendant of Shiva) which was normally enshrined in a separate pavilion facing the sanctum. The linga was man made and in some cases had etchings of Ganapati (son of Shiva) and Parvati (consort and wife of Shiva) on it. Due to <b>the</b> <b>vigorous</b> efforts of priests and ascetics, Shaiva monastic orders flourished in many places such as Nandi Hills, Avani and Hebbata in modern Kolar district.|$|E

5|$|Importing {{horses for}} use as general {{transportation}} and in army cavalries of Indian kingdoms was a flourishing business on the western seaboard. The forests were harvested for rich woods such as teak which was exported through ports located {{in the area of}} present-day Kerala. Song dynasty records from China mention the presence of Indian merchants in ports of South China, indicating active trade with overseas kingdoms. South India exported textiles, spices, medicinal plants, precious stones, pottery, salt made from salt pans, jewels, gold, ivory, rhino horn, ebony, aloe wood, perfumes, sandalwood, camphor and condiments to China, Dhofar, Aden, and Siraf (the entryport to Egypt, Arabia and Persia). Architects (Vishwakarmas), sculptors, quarry workers, goldsmiths and other skilled craftsmen whose trade directly or indirectly related to temple construction were also prosperous due to <b>the</b> <b>vigorous</b> temple building activities.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 the USSR had 70 {{psychiatric}} hospitals and 21,103 psychiatric beds. By 1935 this had increased to 102 {{psychiatric hospitals}} and 33,772 psychiatric beds, and by 1955 there were 200 psychiatric hospitals and 116,000 psychiatric {{beds in the}} Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities built psychiatric hospitals at a rapid pace and increased the quantity of beds for patients with nervous and mental illnesses: between 1962 and 1974 the number of beds for psychiatric patients increased from 222,600 to 390,000. Such an expansion {{in the number of}} psychiatric beds was expected to continue in the years up to 1980. Throughout this period the dominant trend in Soviet psychiatry ran counter to <b>the</b> <b>vigorous</b> attempts in Western countries to treat as many as possible as out-patients rather than in-patients.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to ripeness levels, the harvest yields {{can also have}} a strong influence in the resulting quality and flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The vine itself is prone to vigorous yields, particularly when planted on <b>the</b> <b>vigorous</b> SO4 rootstock. Excessive yields can result in less concentrated and flavorful wine with flavors more on the green or herbaceous side. In the 1970s, a particular clone of Cabernet Sauvignon that was engineered to be virus free was noted for its very high yields-causing many quality conscious producers to replant their vineyards in the late 20th century with different clonal varieties. To reduce yields, producers can plant the vines on less vigorous rootstock and also practice green harvesting with aggressive pruning of grape clusters soon after veraison.|$|E

60|$|To sum up on {{the means}} through which, {{as far as we}} can judge, sexual {{selection}} has led to the development of secondary sexual characters. It has been shewn that the largest number of vigorous offspring will be reared from the pairing of the strongest and best-armed males, victorious in contests over other males, with <b>the</b> most <b>vigorous</b> and best-nourished females, which are the first to breed in the spring. If such females select the more attractive, and at <b>the</b> same time <b>vigorous</b> males, they will rear a larger number of offspring than the retarded females, which must pair with <b>the</b> less <b>vigorous</b> and less attractive males. So it will be if <b>the</b> more <b>vigorous</b> males select <b>the</b> more attractive and at the same time healthy and vigorous females; and this will especially hold good if the male defends the female, and aids in providing food for the young. The advantage thus gained by <b>the</b> more <b>vigorous</b> pairs in rearing a larger number of offspring has apparently sufficed to render sexual selection efficient. But a large numerical preponderance of males over females will be still more efficient; whether the preponderance is only occasional and local, or permanent; whether it occurs at birth, or afterwards from the greater destruction of the females; or whether it indirectly follows from the practice of polygamy.|$|R
40|$|Spectral reflectances were {{measured}} for the canopies of Pinus elliottii seedlings that were inoculated versus noninoculated with the ectomycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus tinctorius. Reflectances of <b>the</b> less <b>vigorous,</b> noninoculated seedlings increased substantially at visible and near-IR wavelengths compared to <b>the</b> more <b>vigorous,</b> inoculated seedlings. An algorithm {{was developed to}} indicate the spectral regions in which reflectance was most sensitive to ectomycorrhizae.

The spectral regions defined by this algorithm are denoted as regions of maximum reflectance sensitivity. Far-red and near-IR photography filtered to the region of maximum sensitivity (700 nm) were used to enable visualization of a 'blue shift' reflectance response to decreased vigor in the noninoculated seedlings in response to these differences of mycorrhizal development...|$|R
5|$|Much of <b>the</b> <b>vigorous</b> {{political}} {{debate in the}} 1790s was sparked by the publication of Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France in November 1790. Most commentators in Britain expected Burke to support the French revolutionaries, because he had previously {{been part of the}} liberal Whig party, a critic of monarchical power, a supporter of the American revolutionaries, and a prosecutor of government malfeasance in India. When he failed to do so, it shocked the populace and angered his friends and supporters. Burke's book, despite being priced at an expensive three shillings, sold an astonishing 30,000 copies in two years. Thomas Paine's famous response, The Rights of Man (1792), which became the rallying cry for thousands, however, greatly surpassed it, selling upwards of 200,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|Some Hydnellum species, {{including}} H. ferrugineum and H. scleropodium, form a tough mat of mycelia in the humus {{and upper}} soil of pine forests. This mycelial mat grows larger with old trees, and can cover {{an area of}} several square meters. These areas generally lack dwarf shrubs and promote <b>the</b> <b>vigorous</b> growth of mosses; reindeer lichens often occur {{in the center of}} large mats. The presence of the fungus changes the nature of the soil, resulting in a thinner humus layer, decreased groundwater penetration, decreased soil pH, and increases in the level of root respiration as well as the quantity of roots. The fungus also decreases the organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Soil with the mycelium becomes more podzolized than the surrounding soil.|$|E
5|$|The Song dynasty {{had one of}} {{the most}} prosperous and {{advanced}} economies in the medieval world. Song Chinese invested their funds in joint stock companies and in multiple sailing vessels at a time when monetary gain was assured from <b>the</b> <b>vigorous</b> overseas trade and domestic trade along the Grand Canal and Yangtze River. Prominent merchant families and private businesses were allowed to occupy industries that were not already government-operated monopolies. Both private and government-controlled industries met the needs of a growing Chinese population in the Song. Artisans and merchants formed guilds that the state had to deal with when assessing taxes, requisitioning goods, and setting standard workers' wages and prices on goods.|$|E

40|$|Polyembryonic {{seeds are}} {{characterized}} {{by the development of}} over one embryo in the same seed, which can be zygotic and nucellar. The objective of this work was to identify the genetic origin, whether zygotic or nucellar, of seedlings of polyembryonic seeds of 'Ubá' mango tree using ISSR markers, and relating them with the vigor of the seedlings. Thus, mangos were harvested in Visconde do Rio Branco (accession 102) and Ubá (accessions 112, 138, 152 and 159), whose seeds were germinated in plastic trays filled with washed sand. Fifty days after sowing, seedlings from five seeds of each one of the accessions 102, 112, 138, 159 and from 10 seeds of the accession 152, were analyzed. These sseedlings were characterized and evaluated for plant height, stem circumference and mass of fresh aerial part and <b>the</b> most <b>vigorous</b> seedling was <b>the</b> one displaying at least two of these traits higher than the other seedlings from seed. Leaves were collected for genomic DNA extraction, which was amplified using seven ISSR primers previously selected based on the amplification profile and considering the number and resolution of fragments. Zygotic seedlings were found in 18 seeds, which were <b>the</b> most <b>vigorous</b> in six seeds. The results evidenced the existence of genetic variability in orchards using seedlings grown from seeds, because the farmer usually uses <b>the</b> most <b>vigorous</b> ones, assuming that this is of nucellar origin. These results also indicate that <b>the</b> most <b>vigorous</b> seedling are not always nucellar, inasmuch as of 20 % of the total seeds evaluated, the zygotic seedling was <b>the</b> most <b>vigorous...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Tories, unlike Whigs such as Earl Grey, {{sought to}} {{continue}} <b>the</b> <b>vigorous</b> {{prosecution of the}} war in Continental Europe against the powerful and aggressive Emperor of the French, Napoleon I. An anti-French alliance, which included Russia, Prussia, Austria, Britain and several smaller countries, defeated Napoleon in 1814. In the subsequent Congress of Vienna, it was decided that the Electorate of Hanover, a state that had shared a monarch with Britain since 1714, would be raised to a kingdom, known as the Kingdom of Hanover. On 30 December 1814, the Prince Regent signed and ratified the Treaty of Ghent which ended the War of 1812 with the United States. Napoleon returned from exile in 1815, but was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, brother of Marquess Wellesley.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Dora {{can be traced}} back to a {{tropical}} wave that emerged off the western African coast on July7. The disturbance tracked into the Caribbean Sea seven days later without any signs of development. However, the system encountered an enhanced flow of moisture in the southwestern Caribbean, allowing for organization and the formation of a broad low-pressure area on July15. Upon tracking into the eastern Pacific, the National Hurricane Center(NHC) judged the storm to have had a low chance developing into a tropical cyclone. The next day, thunderstorm activity erupted around the system, and at 1500UTC on July18, the NHC declared <b>the</b> <b>vigorous</b> disturbance to have reached tropical depression status; in post-season analysis, the NHC found that Dora was already a tropical storm by this point after developing six hours earlier.|$|E
5|$|Increasingly, Edward {{began to}} rely on his sons for the {{leadership}} of military operations. The king's second son, Lionel of Antwerp, attempted to subdue by force the largely autonomous Anglo-Irish lords in Ireland. The venture failed, and the only lasting mark he left were the suppressive Statutes of Kilkenny in 1366. In France, meanwhile, the decade following the Treaty of Brétigny was one of relative tranquillity, but on 8 April 1364 JohnII died in captivity in England, after unsuccessfully trying to raise his own ransom at home. He was followed by <b>the</b> <b>vigorous</b> CharlesV, who {{enlisted the help of}} the capable Constable Bertrand du Guesclin. In 1369, the French war started anew, and Edward's younger son John of Gaunt was given the responsibility of a military campaign.

Similar to some other Hydnellum species, H.ferrugineum is sensitive to the increased nitrogen deposition resulting from clear-cutting, a forestry practice used in some areas of Europe. The fungus forms an unusual type of mycorrhiza with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in which the ectomycorrhiza appears normal at {{the leading edge of the}} mycelial mat, but leaves behind dead and atrophied roots at the trailing edge, showing saprophytic tendencies.|$|E
5|$|The heat is made {{tangible}} by the flustered {{appearance of}} the woman as she fans herself (the fan itself displays a classical scene—perhaps Venus, Adonis and Cupid); the sluggish pregnant dog that looks longingly towards the water; and <b>the</b> <b>vigorous</b> vine growing {{on the side of}} the tavern.

The family rush home, past the New River and a tavern with a sign showing Sir Hugh Myddleton, who bankrupted himself financing the construction of the river to bring running water into London in 1613 (a wooden pipe lies by the side of the watercourse). Through the open window other refugees from the city can be seen sheltering from the oppressive heat in the bar. While they appear more jolly than the dyer and his family, Hogarth pokes fun at these people escaping to the country for fresh air only to reproduce the smoky air and crowded conditions of the city by huddling in the busy tavern with their pipes.|$|E

60|$|Let us {{take any}} species, a bird for instance, and divide the females inhabiting a {{district}} into two equal bodies: the one consisting of <b>the</b> more <b>vigorous</b> and better-nourished individuals, {{and the other}} of <b>the</b> less <b>vigorous</b> and healthy. <b>The</b> former, {{there can be little}} doubt, would be ready to breed in the spring before the others; and this is the opinion of Mr. Jenner Weir, who has during many years carefully attended to the habits of birds. There can also be no doubt that <b>the</b> most <b>vigorous,</b> healthy, and best-nourished females would on an average succeed in rearing the largest number of offspring. The males, as we have seen, are generally ready to breed before the females; of the males the strongest, and with some species the best armed, drive away the weaker males; and the former would then unite with <b>the</b> more <b>vigorous</b> and best-nourished females, as these are the first to breed.
