5|$|Brackman {{claims that}} despite <b>the</b> <b>arrests,</b> Lenin {{continued}} {{his attempts to}} exchange the 500-ruble notes and did manage to trade some of them for 10,000 rubles from an unknown woman in Moscow. According to Nicolaevsky, however, Lenin abandoned attempts to exchange the notes after <b>the</b> <b>arrests,</b> but Bogdanov tried (and failed) to exchange some notes in North America, while Krasin succeeded in forging new serial numbers and managed to exchange several more notes. Soon after, Lenin's associates burned all the 500-ruble notes remaining in their possession.|$|E
5|$|As a result, Bach Xuan Nguyen, {{who led the}} investigation, {{ordered the}} posthumous humiliation of Duyệt. This {{resulted}} in the desecration of his tomb, the execution of sixteen relatives, and <b>the</b> <b>arrests</b> of his colleagues. Minh Mạng's attitude led Duyet's adopted son Khoi {{to break out of}} prison and start a revolt against the emperor on 10 May 1833.|$|E
5|$|Even though Thiệu {{used the}} defeat of the South Vietnamese forces as a {{justification}} for the arrest of those generals, his real intention behind <b>the</b> <b>arrests</b> was to avert an imaginary military coup against him. For that reason, he chose to pull the Airborne Division back to III Corps, which was commanded by loyalist officers, instead of the Marine Corps Division.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>arrests</b> {{brought a}} surge of media {{coverage}} to the sit-in campaign, including national television news coverage, front page stories in both of Nashville's daily newspapers, and an Associated Press story. The students generally viewed any media coverage as helpful to their cause, especially when it illustrated their commitment to nonviolence.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} <b>the</b> <b>arrests</b> were {{publicly}} queried in the House of Commons, and a Labour backbencher Jack Jones started {{a debate on}} the subject in the afternoon. W.C. Bridgeman, the Home Secretary, {{said that he had}} directly ordered the police to arrest the ISDL members under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920, and that he had consulted the Attorney General who considered it legal.|$|E
5|$|Along with Antonio Ezequiel, the {{following}} members of Los Escorpiones were killed on 5 November 2010 in Matamoros: Sergio Antonio Fuentes (alias El Tyson or Escorpión 1); Raúl Marmolejo Gómez (alias Escorpión 18) Hugo Lira (alias Escorpión 26) and Refugio Adalberto Vargas Cortés (alias Escorpión 42). <b>The</b> <b>arrests</b> of Marco Antonio Cortez Rodríguez (alias Escorpión 37) and of Josué González Rodríguez (alias Escorpión 43) allowed {{the authorities to}} understand the structure of Los Escorpiones. There are several music videos on YouTube that exalt the power of Los Escorpiones through narcocorridos, a Mexican drug ballad that tells stories of drug lords and their exploits.|$|E
50|$|A {{person is}} guilty of a class B {{misdemeanor}} if he has knowledge, or by the exercise of reasonable care should have knowledge, that a peace officer is seeking to effect a lawful arrest or detention of that person or another and interferes with <b>the</b> <b>arrest</b> or detention by: (1) use of force or any weapon; (2) <b>the</b> <b>arrested</b> person’s refusal to perform any act required by lawful order: (a) necessary to effect <b>the</b> <b>arrest</b> or detention; and (b) made by a peace officer involved in <b>the</b> <b>arrest</b> or detention; or (3) <b>the</b> <b>arrested</b> person’s or another person’s refusal to refrain from performing any act that would impede <b>the</b> <b>arrest</b> or detention.|$|R

Venkataraman and leaders from different political parties held a protest in New Delhi condemning <b>the</b> <b>arrest</b> while <b>the</b> DMK party chief M. Karunanidhi welcomed <b>the</b> <b>arrest.</b> <b>The</b> then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh advised the state government to handle the case with care, considering the political tension surrounding it.

5|$|Arafat {{established}} a Palestinian police force, named the Preventive Security Service (PSS), that became active on 13 May. It was mainly composed of PLA soldiers and foreign Palestinian volunteers. Arafat assigned Mohammed Dahlan and Jibril Rajoub {{to head the}} PSS. Amnesty International accused Arafat and the PNA leadership for failing to adequately investigate abuses by the PSS (including torture and unlawful killings) of political opponents and dissidents as well as <b>the</b> <b>arrests</b> of human rights activists.|$|E
5|$|Bezen Perrot enacted {{operations}} in January 1944. It was initially employed on guard and surveillance duty around German installations. It {{took part in}} <b>the</b> <b>arrests</b> of Jews, Service du travail obligatoire evaders and resistance fighters. Their knowledge of the Breton language {{proved to be a}} prized possession, enabling the German authorities to intercept arms drops and infiltrate Breton resistance networks who used it to encode their communications. In March, their civilian clothing was replaced with the uniforms of Waffen-SS, lacking any Breton insignia and they were armed with submachine guns, operating in conjunction with the French collaborationist Selbstschutz Polizei.|$|E
5|$|Despite the RIRA's renewed activity, the {{organisation}} was {{weakened by the}} arrest of key members and continued infiltration by informers. McKevitt was arrested on 29 March 2001 and charged with membership of an illegal organisation and directing terrorism, and remanded into custody. In July 2001, following <b>the</b> <b>arrests</b> of McKevitt and other RIRA members, British and Irish government sources hinted that {{the organisation}} was now in disarray. Other key figures were jailed, including the RIRA's Director of Operations, Liam Campbell, {{who was convicted of}} membership of an illegal organisation, and Colm Murphy who was convicted of conspiring to cause the Omagh bombing, although this conviction was overturned on appeal.|$|E
5000|$|There is an onus on {{a person}} under Section 34A(1) of the Justices Act 1959 Tasmania, to be brought before a justice as soon as {{practical}} once taken into custody for an offence. In the ordinary case of an <b>arrest</b> on suspicion, <b>the</b> <b>arresting</b> officer must have satisfied himself {{at the time of}} <b>the</b> <b>arrest</b> that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting the guilt of <b>the</b> person <b>arrested</b> [...] although <b>the</b> grounds of suspicion need not consist of admissible evidence. If <b>the</b> <b>arresting</b> officer believes <b>the</b> information in his possession to be true, if the information reasonably points to the guilt of <b>the</b> <b>arrested</b> person and if <b>the</b> <b>arresting</b> officer thus believes that <b>the</b> <b>arrested</b> person is so likely to be guilty of the offence for which he has been arrested that on general grounds of justice a charge is warranted, he has reasonable and probable cause for commencing a prosecution.|$|R
50|$|Belton {{has been}} {{distinguished}} by Arizona v. Gant, which restricted searches incident to arrest to circumstances {{where it is}} reasonable to believe that: 1) <b>the</b> <b>arrested</b> individual might access the vehicle {{at the time of the}} search; or 2) <b>the</b> <b>arrested</b> individual's vehicle contains evidence of the offense that led to <b>the</b> <b>arrest.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{standards}} of probable cause differ for an arrest and a search. The government has {{probable cause to}} make an arrest when [...] "the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information" [...] would lead a prudent person to believe that <b>the</b> <b>arrested</b> person had committed or was committing a crime. Probable cause to arrest must exist before <b>the</b> <b>arrest</b> is made. Evidence obtained after <b>the</b> <b>arrest</b> may not apply retroactively to justify <b>the</b> <b>arrest.</b>|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{increasingly}} dire military outlook, Nasjonal Samling's {{position at the}} head of the government, albeit with its ambiguous relationship to the Reichskommissariat, remained unassailable. Nevertheless, the Germans exerted increasing control over law and order in Norway. Following deportation of the Jews, Germany deported Norwegian officers and finally attempted to deport students from the University of Oslo. Even Hitler was incensed by the scale of <b>the</b> <b>arrests.</b> Quisling became entangled in a similar debacle in early 1944 when he forced compulsory military service on elements of the Hird, causing a number of members to resign to avoid being drafted.|$|E
5|$|In January 1936, Syrian {{nationalist}} sentiments became incensed as the French authorities suspended {{parliament and}} appointed the pro-French president Taj al-Din al-Hasani. Following {{the arrest of}} some nationalist leaders, a general strike was declared against the French Mandate and President al-Hasani. Speeches denouncing <b>the</b> <b>arrests</b> and colonialism were made at the Umayyad Mosque, after which demonstrators, including students and local youths, gathered at al-Bakri's home where they coordinated a march to the Serail (French government headquarters). The protests were led by al-Bakri, al-Quwatli and Jamil Mardam Bey, but they were confronted by the security forces before leaving al-Bakri's street.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Ngô family {{claimed that}} the army had carried out the raids, {{something}} their U.S. allies initially believed. However, this was later debunked, and the incident prompted the United States to turn against the regime and begin exploring alternative leadership options, eventually leading to Diệm's overthrow in a coup. In South Vietnam itself, the raids stoked widespread anger. Several high-ranking public servants resigned, and university {{and high school students}} boycotted classes and staged riotous demonstrations, resulting in further mass incarcerations. As most of the students were from middle-class public service and military families, <b>the</b> <b>arrests</b> caused further upset among the Ngô family's power base.|$|E
5000|$|On May 26, 2008 Ecuadorean and Colombian media {{reported}} <b>the</b> <b>arrest</b> of García in Ecuador. The Ecuadorean {{military said}} they [...] "probably" [...] did {{have him in}} custody, but needed to do more investigation to be sure. <b>The</b> <b>arrest</b> {{proved to be a}} mistake. <b>The</b> <b>arrested</b> guerrilla was identified as Willington Claro Arévalo, alias 'Antonio'.|$|R

50|$|At <b>the</b> <b>arrest</b> of La Voisin, her maid Margot {{stated that}} <b>the</b> <b>arrest</b> would mean <b>the</b> {{end of a}} number of people in all levels of society. <b>The</b> <b>arrest</b> of La Voisin was {{followed}} by <b>the</b> <b>arrest</b> of her daughter Marguerite Monvoisin, Guibourg, Lesage, Bertrand, Romain and the rest of her network of associates. La Voisin was imprisoned at Vincennes, where she was subjected to questioning. On 27 December 1679, Louis XIV issued an order that the whole network should be exterminated by all methods regardless of the rank, gender or age.|$|R
5|$|Mrkšić {{surrendered}} to the ICTY in the Netherlands in May 2002. Radić and Šljivančanin were arrested in Serbia in May and June 2003 respectively. <b>The</b> <b>arrests</b> were made shortly before the expiration of a deadline set by the U.S. Congress linking financial assistance to Serbia to its cooperation with the ICTY. In 2007, the ICTY convicted Mrkšić and Šljivančanin, but acquitted Radić. Mrkšić received a 20-year prison sentence, while Šljivančanin was sentenced {{to five years in}} prison. In 2009, Šljivančanin's sentence was increased to 17 years in prison on appeal and finally reduced to ten years following a review of the judgment in 2010.|$|E
5|$|On February 5, 1981, 150 police raided four gay bathhouses in Toronto, Ontario: the Club Baths, the Romans II Health and Recreation Spa, the Richmond Street Health Emporium, and The Barracks. The Richmond Health Emporium was {{so badly}} damaged in the raid {{that it never}} reopened. Nicknamed Operation Soap, the raid {{resulted}} in <b>the</b> <b>arrests</b> of 268 men. There was an immediate and angry response from both {{the gay and lesbian}} community and over 3,000 people gathered in protest. A second demonstration which took place on February 20, included over 4,000 people who gathered at Queen's Park and marched to Metro Toronto Police's 52 Division.|$|E
5|$|On June 5, Aruban police {{detained}} Nick John and Abraham Jones, former {{security guards}} {{from the nearby}} Allegro Hotel (which was then closed for renovation) on suspicion of murder and kidnapping. Authorities have never officially disclosed the reason for their arrests, but according to news accounts, statements made by Van der Sloot and Kalpoe {{may have been a}} factor in <b>the</b> <b>arrests</b> of John and Jones. Reports also indicated that the two former guards were known for cruising hotels to pick up women, and {{at least one of them}} had a prior incident with law enforcement. John and Jones were released on June 13 without being charged.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>arrest</b> of League {{officers}} precipitated events: {{either the}} League would act now, {{or it would}} be dissolved by a government. The League searched for support among the senior officers, and Colonel Nikolaos Zorbas was chosen as its figurehead. On 14 August, Pangalos liberated two of <b>the</b> <b>arrested</b> officers, thereby provoking Rallis into ordering a clampdown and <b>the</b> <b>arrest</b> of all league members.|$|R
5000|$|The {{purchase}} {{cable is}} a wire rope that looks {{very similar to}} <b>the</b> <b>arresting</b> cable. They are much longer, however, and are not designed to be easily removed. There are two purchase cables per arresting cable, and they connect to each end of <b>the</b> <b>arresting</b> wire. Purchase cables connect <b>the</b> <b>arresting</b> wire to <b>the</b> <b>arresting</b> gear engines and [...] "pay out" [...] as <b>the</b> <b>arresting</b> wire is engaged by the aircraft. As an incoming aircraft engages the deck pendant, the purchase cable transmits {{the force of the}} landing aircraft from the deck gear to <b>the</b> <b>arresting</b> engine. <b>The</b> pendant (<b>arresting</b> wire) is [...] "swaged" [...] (attached) to the purchase cable by means of a loop created with zinc heated to 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. This onboard fabrication is considered dangerous, and it is reported the Navy is testing the use of an automated press to accomplish it more safely. On land based systems, heavy nylon tapes are used in place of purchase cables, but they serve the same function.|$|R
2500|$|Gant limited {{searches}} {{incident to}} arrest to circumstances {{where it is}} reasonable to believe that: 1) <b>the</b> <b>arrested</b> individual might access the vehicle {{at the time of the}} search; or 2) <b>the</b> <b>arrested</b> individual's vehicle contains evidence of the offense that led to <b>the</b> <b>arrest.</b> <b>The</b> Court suggested in dictum that [...] "when a recent occupant is arrested for a traffic violation, there will be no reasonable basis to believe the vehicle contains relevant evidence." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{pamphlet}} was confiscated by {{the police}} on 8 February. The person who printed the pamphlet, Nikolai Olsen, was arrested on the same day, and the apprehension of Jon Hol followed on 10 February. He remained in custody until 26 February, and was indicted on 11 March, for lèse majesté. Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Lars Holst were indicted on the same charge. Upon <b>the</b> <b>arrests,</b> the newspaper Verdens Gang noted that no conservative writers had been sanctioned, despite openly calling for a coup d'état.|$|E
5|$|The police {{presence}} {{did not appear}} to help: between 2002 and 2006, arrests of juveniles on Metro increased from 156 to 295, and warnings increased 40 percent. Nearly half <b>the</b> <b>arrests</b> occurred at just five stations: Anacostia, Fort Totten, Gallery Place–Chinatown, L'Enfant Plaza, and Minnesota Avenue—four of them on the Green Line. Metro created a special unit to focus on juvenile crime on Metro, and established liaisons at all D.C. public schools to feed intelligence and information about pending problems to Metro's police division.|$|E
5|$|By December 1, 1864, all {{soldiers}} {{had left the}} county to search for armed resistance {{in other parts of}} Pennsylvania. Though widespread draft evasion was evidenced in Columbia County, there was never serious armed resistance. At the end of Columbia County's occupation, the county's Democrats were deeply embittered by <b>the</b> <b>arrests.</b> It is likely that the rumor of the fort originated from sightings of large piles of shingles gathered by draft-evading shingle makers. Wooden tubs for gathering sap from sugar maples seen from a distance were likely mistaken for the fort's cannons. A deserters' hideout on North Mountain, a cabin 20 feet (6 meters) square and two stories high, may {{have been the subject of}} exaggerated claims by Republicans that the cabin was a fort. A structure that may have once been this cabin was rediscovered on July 13, 2007. In December 1864, the soldiers who left Columbia County went on to Clearfield County to continue their search for deserters and draft evaders.|$|E

50|$|After due {{consideration}} the administration determined upon <b>the</b> <b>arrest</b> of <b>the</b> Chief Justice. A warrant or order was issued for his <b>arrest.</b> Then arose <b>the</b> question of service. Who should make <b>the</b> <b>arrest</b> and where should the imprisonment be?
