She joined the Sylvia Young Theatre School when she was eight, attending Saturday classes. Throughout the early stages of her career, Westbrook attended a local state primary school, but she was bullied because of her television appearances, and after one bully cut off her hair, Westbrook's parents removed her from the school. She was sent to a local private school, until, at the age of 12, her parents allowed her to attend Sylvia Young Theatre School as a full-time student, where Denise Van Outen, Dani Behr and her future EastEnders co-star, Nicola Stapleton, were among her contemporaries.|$|E

She also writes that she was forbidden to read the press, and, having peeked at some of it, was content to follow that rule. Stark, of course, had a heavy hand in manipulating the press. Mireille writes that her mother was often surprised to read on the front page that she was engaged to someone famous, or {{was going to be in}} a movie by some famous director. Her guiding principle was just to sing, and never have her family return to the tenements of Croix des Oiseaux.|$|E

[...] According to reviewer Hilton Als, Angelou sang and performed calypso because she [...] "had followed {{the fashion of}} the time", and not to develop as an artist. Als states about Miss Calypso: [...] "But {{it was clear that}} the album itself was not the point. Developing her artistry was not the point. Fame, not art, was her spur..."

500|$|At the council, Walter de Lucy {{produced}} William I's foundation {{charter and}} the confirmation by King Henry I of England, Henry II's grandfather. Both documents were admitted as genuine, and as freeing the abbey from ecclesiastical oversight, as Henry II had at his coronation confirmed all his grandfather's charters. Modern scholarship has shown, however, {{that at least}} one of the documents had been recently forged, shortly before 1155. [...] Hilary argued that only a papal privilege could exempt a monastery from episcopal oversight, and that the abbey had no such privilege. Hilary argued that no king could grant such an exemption, unless they had a licence from the papacy. Henry was unimpressed by this argument, for it impinged on his royal prerogative. Thomas Becket, then Henry's chancellor but later <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>famous</b> for his dispute with Henry over ecclesiastical privileges, was one of Hilary's chief opponents at this council. Eventually, the case was decided by persuading Hilary to renounce any episcopal claims on the abbey.|$|E
