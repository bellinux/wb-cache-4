500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Terrapins were coached by former Florida State head coach Tom Nugent. While with the Seminoles, Nugent {{had wanted to}} recruit a black player, but felt the racial climate there was unsuitable. He said that [...] "the head of the Ku Klux Klan lived in Tallahassee. You'd come <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>car</b> and there'd be a notice on it announcing a Klan meeting that night." [...] When he took over at Maryland in 1959, Nugent saw his opportunity. He {{instructed}} the Terrapins' quarterbacks coach Lee Corso to find a black player who was academically and athletically suited to come to College Park. Corso had been impressed by Roger Staubach's preferred receiver, Darryl Hill, during a freshman match between Maryland and Navy, and had also heard a rumor that he was considering leaving the Naval Academy. In 1962, Corso convinced Hill to transfer to Maryland, a school that had just 32 African-Americans in its 35,000 student body, and become the first black player in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Once there, Hill quickly befriended the team's only Jew, linebacker Jerry Fishman.|$|E

He married his first wife in 1987 and the couple immigrated illegally to the United States for employment opportunities. They settled in Dallas, Texas, where he was employed as a technician fixing typewriters, electronic calculators and computers. The nature of his job required Uribe to spend his day sitting at a desk. Reflecting on those years, Uribe commented: [...] "Life in the United States is like that, you just go from your desk <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>car.</b> I used to drive my car to and from work, so I didn't get any exercise".|$|E

50|$|A common {{example of}} {{bailment}} is leaving <b>your</b> <b>car</b> with a valet.

50|$|Another {{expression}} of Chicano identity through their art is their depictions {{of life in}} the barrio - Spanish-speaking, Latino neighborhoods in a city or town. Often the barrios, as ethnic enclaves, have long histories of dislocation, marginalization, poverty, and inequity in access social services. In the United States, barrios can also refer to the geographical “turf” claimed by Latino gangs, most commonly limited to Chicano gangs in California. However, it was in these barrios that the most interesting forms of art were made by the Chicano community, particularly lowrider cars and bicycles, and graffiti.A very popular style of car, even to this day, emerged from Chicano barrios, known as a “Lowrider.” A lowrider is a style of car that sits lower to the ground than most other cars. Many lowriders have their suspension systems modified with hydraulic suspension so that the car can change height at the flip of a switch. Lowriding originated in the 1930s and blossomed in Southwestern Chicano communities during the post-war prosperity of the ‘50s. Initially, youth who were dressed in the “pachuco” style would place sandbags in the trunk of their customized cars {{in order to create a}} lowered effect. However, this method was quickly replaced by lowering blocks, cut spring coils, z’ed frames and drop spindles. The go al was to cruise as slowly as possible so that people could see what types of customizations were done <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>car.</b> Lowrider customizations consist of sun visors, fender skirts, bug deflectors, and swamp coolers. Expensive custom paint jobs are also common such as metal oxide flake or pearl flake, clear coat, metal leaf, airbrushed murals or script, pinstripes, and flames. Gold or chrome spoke wheels or rims such as Astro Supremes, Cragers, Tru spokes, Crowns, Daytons and Zeniths are also common. Many cars have the modification of having suicide doors, or doors which open in the opposite direction to a standard car door, scissor doors that open vertically, or gull-wing doors that open towards the roof, swinging up. Since the early 1990s, lowriders have become common in urban youth culture in general, primarily in West Coast hip hop. The lowriding scene is diverse including many different cultures, vehicle makes and visual styles, however it remains an important part of the Chicano community and identity.|$|E

30|$|The voice-based {{interactions}} {{evaluated in}} the current study were designed to be completed using simple voice commands. However, like others (e.g., Reimer et al., 2014), we found that many participants routinely glanced at the displays during interactions. Additionally, we found that interactions with the voice-based systems changed the frequency of glances to the forward roadway and side and rear-view mirrors. Based on these findings, it is increasingly evident that natural visual scanning behavior is fundamentally coupled to cognitive processing demands. Quite simply, it is incorrect to assume that talking <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>car</b> is an “eyes-free” activity.|$|E

This study aims to study investigate what leads drivers to use such car-connectivity services. Based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as theoretical framework, this study examines the relationship between four derived constructs (facilitating condition, technographics, mobile literacy, and prior similar experience) and behavioral intention to use car connectivity functionalities. The results show that two of them (facilitating condition and technographics) have significant impact on the intention to use car connectivity services but the other two (mobile literacy and prior similar experience) did not show statistically significant relationship with the behavioral intention...|$|E
40|$|The {{commercial}} {{introduction of}} connected lighting {{that can be}} integrated with sensors and other devices is opening up new possibilities in creating responsive and intelligent environments. The role of lighting in such systems goes beyond simply functional illumination. In {{part due to the}} large and established lighting network, and {{with the advent of the}} LED, new types of lighting output are now possible. However, the current approach for controlling such systems is to simply replace the light switch with a somewhat more sophisticated smartphone-based remote control. The focus of this workshop is to explore new ways of interacting with light where lighting can not only be switched on or off, but is an intelligent system embedded in the environment capable of creating a variety of effects. The connectivity between multiple systems and other ecosystems, for example when transitioning from your home, <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>car</b> and to your office, will also be explored during this workshop as a part of a connected lifestyle between different contexts.

40|$|Why Maintenance Care, and why once a month? Ok, so it’s almost Father’s Day and we’re {{talking about}} maintenance. Do {{you ever think}} about how generally, we dads are in charge of {{maintaining}} everything greasy, dirty or grimy that’s outside, under or in the bowels of our house, while moms are in charge of maintaining everything else inside the house? Maintenance is something we should do for everything we own, and the older I get the more I think about maintenance BEFORE I purchase a product. The more expensive the car, for example, the more likely we’re going to want the best oil to maintain it. We all know what happens when we fail to keep fresh, or enough oil in an engine.

40|$|The goal of {{this system}} {{is to provide a}} {{location}} based alarm system through which customers can broadcast their last known position in emergency situations. Imagine that you are hiking in the forest alone and don’t know how to get back <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>car,</b> or you get lost driving to your friend’s home. At times like these, how can you ask for help? With push of single button or pull off the hands free cord on this system, it will notify your friends with your latest locations immediately. The system is divided into two parts, the client side and the server side. The client side works on the iPhone and other mobile phone platforms and is implemented in Objective C and Java ME. The server side supports more than one server while running on the Linux platform and isimplemented using Java EE. There are two problems that need to be solved before we start. First, how can we get the users' location if their mobile phone does not have a GPS device or they are in an area without GPS signals. As we all know, the mobile phone signal comes from the cell tower and every cell tower has a fixed cover area, The user’s approximate location can be calculated by the cell tower’s location if the tower’s location which the mobile phone gets the signal from is known. Second, since we have more than one server running, how do we synchronize the data on different servers? If we treat this problem as another kind of server/client communication, it can easily be solved. In this thesis report, this system will be described based on the software development process, and how problems encountered during the system development are solved...|$|E
