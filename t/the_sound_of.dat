50|$|Although music {{fills the}} {{cinematic}} void {{in a few}} scenes, <b>the</b> notions <b>of</b> naturalistic <b>sounds</b> are more <b>of</b> use; For example, <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> an empty train station or <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> moving cars in quiet garages.

40|$|Good {{communication}} in English {{produced by the}} students {{is one of the}} goals of language learning. The students are required to have good pronunciation. Nevertheless, the teacher seldom explains pronunciation in details which makes it as obstacles for the students to produce good pronunciation in English. Mispronunciation that produced by the students will make the listeners get wrong idea about their statement. In this study, the writer attempted to find out <b>the</b> kinds <b>of</b> vowel <b>sound</b> shifts and <b>the</b> causes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vowel <b>sound</b> shifts produced by the eighth grade students at SMP Darul Qur-an Singosari. In conducting the study, the writer used descriptive research with 32 students of eighth grade at SMP Darul Qur-an Singosari chosen randomly as the research subjects. The instruments used by the writer to collect the data were performance assessment and interview. The findings of this study revealed that the students shifted 19 sounds from 20 vowel <b>sounds.</b> <b>The</b> vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /ɒ/ shifts into /ʊ/. <b>The</b> vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /ə/ shifts into /ʌ/, /e/, and /ɒ/. <b>The</b> vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /ʌ/ shifts into /ɒ/. <b>The</b> vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /ɜ:/ shifts into /ɪ/, /i:/, and /e/. <b>The</b> vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /aʊ/ shifts into /ɒ/ and /ʌ/. <b>The</b> vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /i:/ shifts into /e/. <b>The</b> vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /aɪ/ shifts into /ə/, /ɪ/, /e/, and /eɪ/. <b>The</b> vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /Ã¦/ shifts into /aɪ/, /eɪ/, and /e/. <b>The</b> vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /u:/ shifts into /əʊ/, /Ã¦/, /ʊə/, /aʊ/, /ʊ/, and /e/. <b>The</b> vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /eə/ shifts into /e/ and /ʌ/. <b>The</b> vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /ɪ/ shifts into /ʌ/, /ʊ/ and /aɪ/. <b>The</b> vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /əʊ/ shifts into /ɒ/ and /ʊ/. <b>The</b> vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /eɪ/ shifts into /ə/, /ʌ/, /e/, and /ɒ/. <b>The</b> vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /ɪə/ shifts into/e/, /ɪ/, and /ə/. <b>The</b> vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /ɔ:/ shifts into /ɒ/, /aʊ/, /ʊ/ and /eɪ/. <b>The</b> vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /e/ shifts into /ʌ/. <b>The</b> vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /ʊ/ shifts into /ɒ/ and /ʌ/. <b>The</b> vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /ɑ:/ shifts into /e/ and /ə/. <b>The</b> vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /ʊə/ shifts into /ɒ/. It was influenced by native language, age, exposure, innate phonetic ability, and motivation and concern or good pronunciation. To sum up, pronunciation is an important feature when the learners are speaking. A single word that shifts will make different meaning...|$|R
5000|$|And finally, {{the most}} {{important}} observation. When, in Enthusiasm, <b>the</b> industrial <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> All-Union Stokehold arrive at the square, filling the streets with their machine music to accompany the gigantic festive parades; when on the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> military bands, of parades ... fuse with <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machines, <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> competing factory shops; when the work of bridging the gape in the Donbas passes before us as an endless [...] "Communist Sabbath", as [...] "the days of industrialization", as a red star, red banner campaign. We must view this not as a shortcoming, but as a serious, long-range experiment.|$|R

50|$|Some flue pipes are {{designed}} to produce <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> reed pipes or to imitate <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> orchestral instruments which are approximated by reed pipes. <b>The</b> <b>sound</b> is generally more mellow and sweet {{than that of a}} true reed pipe.

5|$|Alongside their {{critical}} acclaim and strong {{success in the}} charts, Editors have consistently enjoyed sold-out tours and numerous headlining festival slots.

5|$|Although Coming Up to Breathe {{possesses}} {{an overall}} heavier tone than MercyMe's previous albums, {{it has been}} described as an extension or a shift in presentation rather than a total departure. <b>The</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the album {{has been described as}} epitomizing the genre of modern rock. Guitars and guitar solos are more prominent on the album.|$|E
5|$|Although the Mellotron was {{designed}} to reproduce <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the original instrument, replaying a tape creates minor fluctuations in pitch (wow and flutter), and amplitude, so a note sounds slightly different each time it is played.

50|$|The {{original}} Seguida {{group was}} founded {{by a group of}} New York musicians whose ancestry was of Puerto Rican heritage.

5|$|Born to a Pentecostal-minister father, D'Angelo {{was brought}} up to an early {{appreciation}} of gospel music, while his mother, a jazz enthusiast, {{introduced him to the}} musical complexities of trumpeter Miles Davis and the funk and soul music of the 1970s. In addition to old gospel records, these factors inspired him during the making of Brown Sugar, as D'Angelo drew upon his roots of traditional gospel and soul, and infused <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> contemporary R and hip hop music to create a stylistically unique and soulful sound for the album. The album has been noted by critics for its classic soul elements and influences, as well as <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> live instruments and organic grooves, which are reminiscent of the work of Stevie Wonder and Sly & the Family Stone. Its production contrasts the producer-driven and digital approach of contemporary R {{at the time of its}} release.|$|E
5|$|Clarinets {{were soon}} {{accepted}} into orchestras. Later models had a mellower tone than the originals. Mozart (d. 1791) liked <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the clarinet (he considered its tone the closest in {{quality to the}} human voice) and wrote numerous pieces for the instrument., {{and by the time}} of Beethoven (c. 1800–1820), the clarinet was a standard fixture in the orchestra.|$|E

5|$|Crofting is the {{mainstay}} of island life. Sheep form {{the backbone of the}} agricultural economy but a diversity livestock are kept, including cattle, pigs, goats, chickens, ducks and geese. Vegetable are grown too, often in the shelter of circular walls, such plots being known as 'plantie scrubs'. Fishing is still conducted but on a relatively small scale. There is a post office at the pier, but no shop. Mains electricity only came to the island {{at the close of the}} twentieth century. The Papa Stour Project is a Christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcohol issues. Ferries now sail across <b>the</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> Papa to West Burrafirth on the Shetland Mainland. The crossing takes 45 minutes, and although the Snolda carries cars, there is only one short road on the island. For visiting yachts the four main voes provide good shelter, but the strong tides in both <b>the</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> Papa and to the north west require considerable care.|$|E
