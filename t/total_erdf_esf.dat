40|$|Abstract: The Structural Funds (<b>ERDF,</b> <b>ESF)</b> have {{invested}} vast sums {{to enhance the}} functional environment of SME ‘s by building infrastructure and improving skills of workforce. The last enlargement of EU, with accession of Romania and Bulgaria, has brought the Structural Fund resources available in new countries. However the project experience has only recently started accumulating and the participation of beneficiaries (SME’s in this case) to the planning processes is quite new. In University of Suceava there are some projects will help to consider promoting entrepreneurship project outside of formal school activity as an educational leisure and as a learning activity for young people. With those project crucial insights will be gained in the need, willingness and possibilities {{for the establishment of}} business incubators in the cross-border region in the coming years...|$|R

40|$|Cohesion policy (<b>ERDF,</b> <b>ESF</b> and CF) is {{implemented}} {{in a system}} of shared management. Signals received from some EU countries indicate that legal uncertainty is created for beneficiaries of cohesion policy funds due to differences in interpretation of, mostly national, regulation. This is a problem because the prospect of legal uncertainty, with the consequence of returning paid subsidies, and the audit burden associated with European funding, may deter organizations from applying for funds. This paper tries to gain a first insight in how this legal uncertainty is created and whether these differences in interpretation are found across the EU. This study focuses on the relationship and communication between the management and audit authorities and the effect of this dialogue on legal certainty and the way audit is carried out under a shared management system. We touch upon the fear of audits, fear because professionals feel they are under constant challenge of being undermined in the future...|$|R

40|$|The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), and the {{guidance}} {{element of the}} European Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) associated with the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) constitute the Structural Funds of the European Community. Each of these Funds was begun separately and was designed to meet particular needs. For example, the Regional Fund was originally designed {{to mitigate the effect}} on regions of the Community of existing inequalities by region, adverse effects resulting from the operation of the Rome Treaty, and a natural tendency to centralisation and the effects this has on the periphery, while the Guidance section of the European Guidance and Guarantee Fund was focused on structural improvement in farming. The Act establishing the Single Market (the Single European Act) required that these funds be reorganised to become more effective. The 1988 Community budget settlement agreed that the <b>ERDF</b> and the <b>ESF</b> should increase, with the level of spending in 1993 double that of 1987, and with a concentration of spending in poorer regions. This was taken further in 1989 when Heads of State and Government, taking not only the <b>ERDF</b> and <b>ESF</b> but the EAGGF (Guidance Section) and the European Investment Bank (EIB), established the Community Support Framework (CSF) - namely the set of reorganised Structural Funds, designed, as the name implies, to support development in areas whose own resources were inadequate to reduce inequalities between regions within the EC.

The indirect cytotoxicity evaluation of the samples followed an adaptation of the ISO 10993 - 5 standard test method. Based on the measurement of their molecular weight, molar mass, pH, water absorption and dimensions, the porous scaffolds of PLGA with a lower lactide/glycolide (LA/GA) molar ratio degraded faster due to their higher hydrophilicity.

The {{direction}} and impact parameter dependence of electronic stopping power, along with its velocity threshold behavior, is investigated in a prototypical small-band-gap semiconductor. We calculate the electronic stopping power of H in Ge, a semiconductor with relatively low packing density, using time-evolving time-dependent density-functional theory. The calculations are carried out in channeling conditions with different impact parameters and in different crystal directions for projectile velocities ranging from 0. 05 to 0. 6 atomic units. The satisfactory comparison with available experiments supports the results and conclusions beyond experimental reach. The calculated electronic stopping power is found to differ in different crystal directions; however, strong impact parameter dependence is observed only in one of these directions. The distinct velocity threshold observed in experiments is well reproduced, and its nontrivial relation with the band gap follows a perturbation theory argument surprisingly well. This simple model is also successful in explaining why different density functionals give the same threshold even with substantially different band gaps.

40|$|This report {{describes}} a simple strategy to produce copolymers of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and glycidyl phenyl ether (GPE) by using B(C 6 F 5) 3 as a catalyst. The {{control of the}} synthesis conditions, such as reaction time, catalyst concentration, and monomer concentration, allows the formation of copolymers with molecular weights {{in the range of}} 15 - 330 kg/mol. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed that with a low THF content in the feed cyclic copolymers are the major reaction products, whereas with a high THF content, linear copolymers are the main products. To explain these results, a zwitterionic ring-opening copolymerization mechanism was postulated based on DFT calculations and experimental results. Physical properties of the resulting copolymers demonstrated that by changing the relative amounts of monomers copolymers with tailored glass transition temperatures in a broad range of temperatures from- 84 to- 4 °C can be obtained and that crystallization of THF fragments can be suppressed. Rheological measurements showed that by controlling the degree of crystallization, copolymers with rubber-like behavior can be obtained in a broad temperature range below room temperature.

40|$|The European {{paternal}} lineage R-DF 27 {{has been}} proposed as a haplogroup of Iberian origin due to its maximum frequencies in the Iberian Peninsula. In this study, the distribution and structure of DF 27 were characterized in 591 unrelated male individuals from four key populations of the north area of the Iberian Peninsula through the analysis of 12 Y-SNPs that define DF 27 main sublineages. Additionally, Y-SNP allele frequencies were also gathered from the reference populations in the 1000 Genomes Project to compare and obtain a better landscape {{of the distribution of}} DF 27. Our results reveal frequencies over 35 % of DF 27 haplogroup in the four North Iberian populations analyzed and high frequencies for its subhaplogroups. Considering the low frequency of DF 27 and its sublineages in most populations outside of the Iberian Peninsula, this haplogroup seems to have geographical significance; thus, indicating a possible Iberian patrilineal origin of vestiges bearing this haplogroup.

Here we investigate the properties of ice confined to a quasi- 2 D monolayer by a featureless, chemically neutral potential, in order to characterize its intrinsic behaviour. We use density-functional theory simulations with a non-local van der Waals density functional. An ab initio random structure search reveals all the energetically competitive monolayer configurations to belong to {{only two of the}} previously-identified families, characterized by a square or honeycomb hydrogen-bonding network, respectively. We discuss the modified ice rules needed for each network, and propose a simple point dipole 2 D lattice model that successfully explains the energe tics of the square configurations. All identified stable phases for both networks are found to be non-polar (but with a topologically non-trivial texture for the square) and, hence, non-ferroelectric, in contrast to previous predictions from a five-site empirical force-field model.

After annealing studied microwires exhibit ferromagnetic behavior at room temperature. We directly measured the temperature change, DT, originated from the MCE in annealed NiMnGa glasscoated microwires and after glass removal. After glass removal DT increases from 0. 06 - 0. 08 K to 0. 22 K. Observed temperature dependence of magnetization and MCE should {{be associated with}} both magnetic (paramagnetic-ferromagnetic) and structural (austenite-martensite) phase transitions. Considerable magnetization increase in vicinity of Curie temperature can be also attributed to the Hopkinson effect. We evaluated the possibility to prepare the magnetocaloric materials for magnetic refrigerators {{in the form of}} glass-covered microwires and showed that glass-coated microwires might be interesting for the MCE applications owing to high ratio of surface to volume. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from the {{publisher}} via the DOI in this record. OBJECTIVES: Multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae pose a significant threat to public health. We aimed to study the impact of sewage treatment effluent on antibiotic resistance reservoirs in a river. METHODS: River sediment samples were taken from downstream and upstream of a waste water treatment plant (WWTP) in 2009 and 2011. Third-generation cephalosporin (3 GC) -resistant Enterobacteriaceae were enumerated. PCR-based techniques were used to elucidate mechanisms of resistance, with a new two-step PCR-based assay developed to investigate bla(CTX-M- 15) mobilization. Conjugation experiments and incompatibility replicon typing were used to investigate plasmid ecology. RESULTS: We report the first examples of bla(CTX-M- 15) in UK river sediment; the prevalence of bla(CTX-M- 15) was dramatically increased downstream of the WWTP. Ten novel genetic contexts for this gene were identified, carried in pathogens such as Escherichia coli ST 131 as well as indigenous aquatic bacteria such as Aeromonas media. The bla(CTX-M- 15) -gene was readily transferable to other Gram-negative bacteria. We also report the first finding of an imipenem-resistant E. coli in a UK river. CONCLUSIONS: The high diversity and host range of novel genetic contexts proves that evolution of novel combinations of resistance genes is occurring at high frequency and has to date been significantly underestimated. We have identified a worrying reservoir of highly resistant enteric bacteria in the environment that poses a threat to human and animal health.

40|$|In {{this work}} we present the {{formulas}} for {{the calculation of}} exact three-center electron sharing indices (3 c-ESI) and introduce two new approximate expressions for correlated wave functions. The 3 c-ESI uses the third-order density, the diagonal of the third-order reduced density matrix, but the approximations suggested in this work only involve natural orbitals and occupancies. In addition, the first calculations of 3 c-ESI using Valdemoro's, Nakatsuji's and Mazziotti's approximation for the third-order reduced density matrix are also presented for comparison. Our results on a test set of molecules, including 32 3 c-ESI values, prove that the new approximation based on the cubic root of natural occupancies performs the best, yielding absolute errors below 0. 07 and an average absolute error of 0. 015. Furthemore, this approximation seems to be rather insensitive {{to the amount of}} electron correlation present in the system. This newly developed methodology provides a computational inexpensive method to calculate 3 c-ESI from correlated wave functions and opens new avenues to approximate high-order reduced density matrices in other contexts, such as the contracted Schrödinger equation and the anti-Hermitian contracted Schrödinger equationThe authors are indebted to Mauricio Rodriguez-Mayorga for his assistance with some calculations.

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 1860 on 07. 20. 2017 by CS (TIS) This thesis develops {{the argument that}} research on the European Community (EC) could be enriched by studies of how Community policies are implemented. The processes by which EC policies are formulated {{have been the subject}} of a great deal of research. However, the way in which these policies are subsequently put into practice and whether or not their objectives are achieved has received very little attention. Yet these processes may be highly complex, involving a large variety of institutions and actors at Community, national and regional levels. The complexity of implementation and of the Community's political system offers scope for a significant "implementation gap" between policy objectives and outcomes. This study is therefore about the implementation of EC regional policy. More specifically, it focus*is- on the operation in the United Kingdom of two Community Funds with regional objectives; namely, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF). In particular, the activities of the two Funds in South West England are examined. The research also assesses the roles in implementation of the European Commission and national government departments in the UK. The research shows that the UK government is able to influence many aspects of the implementation process by means of its pivotal role in decision-making and its ability to control many financial aspects of the provision of EC grants. As a result, the objectives of the <b>ERDF</b> and <b>ESF</b> may be overwhelmed by the entirely national objectives of government. On the other hand, this study demonstrates that the European Commission can exert some control in order to pursue the Funds' "Community" objectives. The organisations at regional level which actually apply for EC grants are also shown to be of importance. Their involvement is determined by factors such as government restrictions on expenditure, assisted area status, the availability of information, local iniciative and the efficiency of organisational structurcs. The research, which coincided with a period in which EC regional policy is being reformed, calls for more explicit concern in the future with how the Community's increasingly prominent regional development objectives are put into practice. Moreover, it asserts that studying how Community policies operate can help to shed more light on the nature of the EC's political system. Exeter Universit...|$|R
40|$|Although {{walking for}} leisure can support health, {{there has been}} little {{systematic}} attempt to consider how recreational walking is best promoted. In the UK, local authorities create promotional materials for walking networks, but little is known about whether they effectively encourage walking through persuasive messaging. Many of these materials pertain to walks in natural environments which evidence suggests are generally visited less frequently by physically inactive individuals. Consequently the present study explores whether and how recreational walking brochures use persuasive messages in their promotion of walks in natural environments. A coding taxonomy was developed to classify text in recreational walking brochures according to five behavioural content areas and 87 categories of potentially persuasive messages. Reliability of the taxonomy was ascertained and a quantitative content analysis was applied to 26 brochures collected from Devon, UK. Brochures often provided information about an advertised route, highlighted cultural and aesthetic points of interest, and provided directions. Brochures did not use many potentially effective messages. Text seldom prompted behaviour change or built confidence for walking. Social norm related information was rarely provided and there was a general lack of information on physical activity and its benefits for health and well-being. The limited range of message strategies used in recreational walking brochures may not optimally facilitate walking in natural environments for inactive people. Future research should examine the effects of theory-informed brochures on walking intentions and behaviour. The taxonomy could be adapted to suit different media and practices surrounding physical activity in natural environments.

40|$|Dewfall {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as {{an important source of}} water for many ecosystems, especially in arid and semiarid areas, contributing to improve daily and annual water balances and leading to increased interest in its study in recent years. In this study, occurrence, frequency and amount of dewfall were measured from January 2007 to December 2010 (4 [*]years study) to find out its contribution to the local water balance in a Mediterranean semiarid steppe ecosystem dominated by scattered tussocks of Stipa tenacissima (Balsa Blanca, Almería, SE Spain). For this purpose, we developed a dewfall measurement method, ‘The Combined Dewfall Estimation Method’ (CDEM). This method consists of a combination of the potential dewfall model, i. e. the single-source Penman–Monteith evaporation model simplified for water condensation, with information from leaf wetness sensors, rain gauge data, soil surface temperature and dew point temperature. To assess the reliability of the CDEM, dewfall was measured in situ using weighing microlysimeters during a period of 3 [*]months. Daily micrometeorological variables involved in a dewfall event were analysed in order to assess the significance of dewfall at this site. Dewfall condensation was recorded on 78 % of the nights during the study period. Average monthly dewfall duration was 9. 6 [*]±[*] 3. 2 [*]h per night. Average dewfall was 0. 17 [*]±[*] 0. 10 [*]mm per night and was mostly dependent on dewfall duration. Dewfall episodes were longer in late autumn and winter and shorter during spring. Annual dewfall represented the 16 %, 23 %, 15 % and 9 % of rainfall on 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Furthermore, when a wet period was compared to a dry one, the dewfall contribution to the water balance at the site was found to be 8 % and 94 %, respectively. Our results highlight the relevance of dewfall as a constant source of water in arid ecosystems, as well as its significant contribution to the local water balance, mainly during dry periods where it may represent the only source of water at the site.

Version: FinalThe Maltese development pattern is influenced by the typical features of small island states: scarce natural resources, high density of population, lack of critical mass in infrastructure investment, high external dependency etc. These features have an impact on transport, the environment and the sustainability of tourism and make it necessary to strengthen the Island’s knowledge-based economy in order to promote competitiveness. EU Cohesion Policy contributes considerably to tackling these issues through support from the ERDF and Cohesion Fund, while the Island participates in cross-border, trans-national and interregional cooperation programmes. The priorities of these programmes are highly complementary and consistent with the key development challenges: the support is concentrated mainly on sustainable development and environmental protection, (e. g. waste management and water treatment plants), knowledge and innovation as well as transport. Malta has been allocated EUR 728 million of ERDF and Cohesion Fund for the 2007 - 2013 period. Environment-related investment represents a key priority and accounts for 38 % of the total allocation; 25 % of the <b>total</b> <b>ERDF</b> has been allocated to accessibility and transport; around 22 % has been allotted to territorial development and 13 % to support enterprise environment. The overall commitment rate as at end 2009 amounted to around 50 % of total funding allocated and during 2009 there were 229 projects (including aid schemes) being implemented. In 2009 the Programme started producing its first outputs and results on the ground: first signs of construction of infrastructure; equipment being procured and s mobilisation of much needed support for enterprises. The recent economic crisis did not change the strategy and the objectives of the OP, which are arguably well suited for fostering the upturn in the economy, thanks to the focus on transport infrastructure, environment, energy territorial development (including tourism) and enterprise support. To boost investment in enterprises and mitigate the consequences of the crisis, in some cases, the allocation of the funds was diverted from public infrastructure to private sector support (e. g. EUR 12 million were allocated to a number of aid schemes for firms, focusing on e-business development, R&D, international competitiveness, innovation and energy). Evidence on performance of intervention is limited and it is too early to identify examples of good practice. The Mid-Term Evaluation of the ERDF OP is currently being carried out and some results can be expected by the end of the year. The ex ante evaluation of the OP, carried out initially, is mostly an analysis of the coherence of the strategy and did not attempt to assess the potential effects of the programme. An analysis of the effectiveness of projects co-financed by the Structural Funds in 2004 - 2006 examined the achievements of a sample of 13 initiatives, focusing mainly on recommendations for the future in terms of monitoring and collection of data. Some of the main future challenges facing EU Cohesion Policy include: continue to tackle the lack of innovation and entrepreneurial culture and increase the capacity of Malta to generate research and apply new technologies; increase awareness of environmental problems among people and implement larger projects with a significant impact on environmental protection; develop an evaluation culture to systematically assess the performance of policy; improve cooperation between administrative bodiesN/...|$|R
40|$|The European Union is a 60 {{year long}} {{collaboration}} between the European countries. It was born from the intention to ease trade and thereby reassure peace. Within the 60 years EU has functioned it has developed and expanded further. In 1952 it evolved around the trade of coal and steel between six countries, today it includes 27 nations and oversees {{a large number of}} topics such as foreign affairs, a common currency and regional politics. EU has grown at several times, the latest expansion was the largest where 12 new countries became members. The unions of countries that only 60 years ago were at different sides of a world war can be considered an accomplishment. Within the EU there are great economic and social differences. The aim is to even out those differences by Cohesion Policy and the structural funds. Every seventh year the union develop a long term budget which also includes the fi nancing, goals and structure of those funds. The total budget for the EU in between 2007 - 2013 is 862 billion euro, approximately one third of that sum falls into the structural funds in order to fulfill the aim to decrease social differences. The structural funds are divided into three different funds, the <b>ESF,</b> <b>ERDF</b> and the Cohesion Fund. These so called funds are rather to be considered different posts in the EU long term budget than actual funds. However they finance different fields with different goals. This thesis focuses on the goal aiming towards regional competitiveness and development and the ERDF fund. Sweden is divided into eight different regions; every region has developed their own operational program that presents the regional goals and focus. The operational program is based on the regional development plans of the county’s regional development plan. Every municipality in Sweden is a part of a county but also a region which implies that they are a part of a regional development plan as well as an operational program. In order to get projects approved and money granted by the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth certain criteria given by the EU must be fulfi lled together with criteria decided on the national level. The single municipality holds a large number of document and legislation to relate to in their daily work with planning. The Swedish municipalities are affected both by the EU legislation and by the above mentioned national strategies and visions. The Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions represent Sweden in the EU Regional committee. The committee is the arena where Sweden is given the opportunity to infl uence legislation and strategies. Sweden is however {{a small part of the}} union and long term planning is necessary in order to achieve change. AIM My aim is to investigate how comprehensive planning in Sweden is related to the economic infl uence of the EU by researching examples from different geographical areas in Sweden. Through the thesis I want to develop my analytical skills as well as find a greater understanding for what authorities infl uence the planning process. DELIMITATION I compared the result of the applications to the EU fund in two regions, the middle part of Norrland, and the eastern part of mid-Sweden. I chose projects performed within the project period 2007 - 2013 that were completed. The planning documents I focused on in each municipality I studied where the goals, visions and comprehensive plans. RESEARCH QUESTIONS My research questions were: - Does the European regional development fund effect the comprehensive planning in Sweden and if so how is it visible? - Is there any geographical difference in how the effect/impact of the structural fund is visible between regions? - Are there any common trends to be seen in the projects that were given fi nancial support from the funds? METHOD I used two methods in order to answer the research questions, literate studies and interviews. The literature study holds three parts; articles and books, applications and final reports from projects that were granted funds from ERDF and finally comprehensive plans from the municipalities concerned with the projects. The interviews were performed with four persons who possess different connections to the effect of EU on Swedish comprehensive planning. Göran Theolin is responsible for matters concerning EU at Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth. Anders Risberg and Per Grängsjö are in charge of the regions eastern Mid-Sweden and Mid-Norrland. Anna Carlsson is senior adviser for regional growth at the Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications. RESULT The main part of the literature concerning the structural funds and their impact are found with different authorities. I considered the information reliable even though it is seldom screened in the same way as books or articles. Therefor I decided to perform a literature study based on books and articles, on the growth and development of the structural funds, the expansion of EU and regional politics. The Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth gather all approved project applications available to the public. I used the delimitations in order to choose the projects I wanted to research. Five of my research projects were found through the project database, the sixth was recommended to me in my interview with Anders Risberg. Both the applications and fi nal reports of the chosen projects were reviewed in order to fi nd out what impact the performed project could show on the development of the municipality. To better understand how the municipalities concerned with the projects I reviewed aimed to develop I read their comprehensive plans with a focus on visions and goals. Since the comprehensive plans differ both in amplitude and content when it comes to visions and goals as well as the time of latest update I gathered the information I found in a table. By gathering all municipality goals and visions in the table I made it easier to compare them to one another. In order to conclude the visions and goals into a few sentences I had to make sure I had great understanding for the municipal intentions. The visions and goals of the municipalities where then compared with the project impact to see if the project helped fulfi ll any part of the visions or the opposite. These comparisons showed both differences between the regions but also some difference between municipalities within a region. The most revealing difference was that projects performed in one single municipality more often fulfilled the goals and vision whereas projects involving several municipalities often, not always, fulfi lled some part of the municipality visions. One of the reasons that the common projects did fulfi ll parts of the visions is probably due to the fact that most municipalities hold similar prerequisites and issues and express similar visions and goals as a result. The interviews gave me information that would have been hard to come by in written sources. Even more important the interviewees provided me with fi rst hand views and opinions on the structural funds. I also found answers to my research questions concerning regional differences and whether ERDF impacts Swedish comprehensive planning. DISCUSSION After completing this study I can declare that the EU structural funds do effect Swedish comprehensive planning. The possibility given to municipalities to apply for financial support to perform projects has meant that projects have been carried through faster than they would have without additional funding. From what I have seen when studying comprehensive plans, fi nal reports, operational programs and interviewed people in different positions at the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth I can conclude that the municipalities are using the ERDF as means to carry out their goals and visions in several cases. Through the literature I read I have received a clear image of how the structural funds affect the EU and the huge amounts of money the funds hold. The main goal; to even out social and economic differences within the union are indeed positive but raises the question on whether or not the funds are the best way to achieve the goal and if the money ends up where they are best needed? By choosing three projects from both regions I found understanding on how the funds impact the participating municipalities. My results are based on the comparison of the municipality goals and visions in the comprehensive plan and the described effects the chosen projects. These projects are only a small part of the total amount of projects that are performed with funding from the EU. A similar comparison between a different selection of projects in other areas and municipalities would maybe show a somewhat different result...|$|R
