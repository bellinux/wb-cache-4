In 1927, {{forwards}} Said and Jairo joined Castro to form an attacking partnership nicknamed the Trio Maldito ("Unholy Trio"), which guided Atlético <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>state</b> league triumph. In 1929, the club played its first international encounter, against Portuguese club Vitória de Setúbal, winning 3–1 in a match played at the Presidente Antônio Carlos Stadium. The ground had opened earlier that year, and would be the club's home for the following two decades.|$|E
5|$|Several factors, however, soon {{reduced the}} value of the treaty for Prussia. Treaty of Reichenbach of July 27, 1790, meant that Prussia was no longer {{considering}} a war with Austria; the Polish–Prussian alliance now had only an anti-Russian angle. Then, on September 9, the Great Sejm, despite some opposition, declared that Commonwealth territories could not be divided. As Prussia was expecting to receive Gdańsk and Toruń from the Commonwealth as a compensation in a subsequent treaty (with Commonwealth being compensated through territorial gains from another neighbor), the Sejm declaration that meant that no territory could be traded <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>state</b> made the Commonwealth a much less valuable party for Prussian long-term goals. Already in fall and winter of 1790, Prussian diplomacy begun negotiations with Russians, and hinting at its abandoning of Poland.|$|E

5|$|When {{the highway}} was first {{designated}} {{in the late}} 1910s, it extended farther south than it does today and ended well short of its current northern terminus. The southern end was added <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>state</b> highway, truncating M-18's length to roughly its current southern terminus in 1926. The northern end was also simultaneously extended {{for the first time}} with these revisions to the highway's routing. In the 1940s, the northern extension was reversed and then reinstated. M-18's course was last changed with the opening of three different freeways in the area in the 1960s and 1970s. The last extension in 1973 supplanted the M-144 designation from Roscommon north to Luzerne.|$|E

25|$|Quantum physics {{does not}} allow us to access all this {{information}} directly, though. A measurement will yield only one of all possible values, destroying all others. If not for the no cloning theorem, we could first measure f(x) without measuring x, and then make a few copies of the resulting state (which is a superposition of states all having the same f(x)). Measuring x on these states would provide different x values which give the same f(x), leading to the period. Because we cannot make exact copies of a quantum state, this method does not work. Therefore, we have to carefully transform the superposition <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>state</b> that will return the correct answer with high probability. This is achieved by the quantum Fourier transform.|$|E
25|$|In many jurisdictions (including many American states), {{there is}} a general tax levied {{periodically}} on residents who own personal property (personalty) within the jurisdiction. Vehicle and boat registration fees are subsets of this kind of tax. The tax is often designed with blanket coverage and large exceptions for things like food and clothing. Household goods are often exempt when kept or used within the household. Any otherwise non-exempt object can lose its exemption if regularly kept outside the household. Thus, tax collectors often monitor newspaper articles for stories about wealthy people who have lent art to museums for public display, because the artworks have then become subject to personal property tax. If an artwork had to be sent <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>state</b> for some touch-ups, it may have become subject to personal property tax in that state as well.|$|E

50|$|The {{first step}} of this process, photoexcitation, is {{initiated}} by absorption of a photon, promoting an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the photocatalyst <b>to</b> <b>another</b> spin-allowed <b>state.</b> Thus, since the ground state of the photocatalyst is a singlet state (a state with no total electron spin), the photon absorption excites the catalyst <b>to</b> <b>another</b> singlet <b>state</b> of higher energy.

Such elements are not only likely to produce the initiation of the verbal challenges <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>state's</b> government, but have the propensity to lead countries to use military force in support of these regime claims...|$|R
