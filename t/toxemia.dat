40|$|With {{the advent}} of urea and {{creatinine}} clear-ance tests as measures of kidney function, the possibility of more closely associating the etiology of the <b>toxemias</b> of pregnancy with renal pathol-ogy was reopened. Thus, Stander, Ashton and Cadden (1) undertook an investigation of renal function in the <b>toxemias</b> of pregnancy and deter-mined the urea and creatinine clearance rates, {{in conjunction with a}} number of other tests of kid-ney function, on 65 women in various stages of pregnancy. They found no important variations in normal pregnancy or in the low reserve kidney of pregnancy. However, both clearances were subnormal, at from 55 to 80 per cent, in nephritic <b>toxemias</b> (Stander's classification (2)). Cadden and McLane (3) extended these studies on 343 pathological pregnancies, using urea and creati-nine clearance and the phenolsulphonephthalein tests of kidney function, and concluded that only urea clearance was sufficiently sensitive to dif-ferentiate chronic nephritis from the other toxe-mias of pregnancy. Their antepartum averages were: for 9 cases of normal pregnancy, 122. 7 per cent; for 90 of low reserve kidney, 101. 7; for 87 of nephritis, 75. 3; for 17 of preeclampsia, 84. 4; and for 4 cases of eclampsia, 54. 7 per cent. Hur-witz and Ohler (4), in 103 tests performed in the ninth month of pregnancy, found urea clearance values from 90 to 140 per cent, averaging 127 per cent, in normal pregnancy, and from 26 to 84 per cent in eclampsia, chronic nephritis and the late <b>toxemias</b> of pregnancy.

40|$|The {{important}} rôle of the sulfhydryl {{group in}} metabolic processes {{has long been}} recognized. It is suggested the possibility that <b>toxemias</b> of pregnancy {{may be related to}} the sulfhydryl contents in sera. Therefore, the sulfhydryl activity in sera was measured in normal and toxemic pregnant women. The author has carried out experiments according to Brdicka's polarographic method on sera from 43 pregnant women. Summary 1 The free sulfhydryl group in sera was estimated by a Brdicka's method. 2 Among normal non-pregnant women, the sulfhydryl content expressed as a wave height on polarogram were nearly uniform. 3 Sulfhydryl activities of pregnant women in the last trimester show values about 21. 8 % lower than non-pregnant women. 4 Sera obtained from pregnant women with marked edema showed a significant reduction in the sulfhydrylcontent and markedly in women with eclampsia. 5 The application of serial serum sulfhydryl determinations in pregnant women may be of value for study on <b>toxemias</b> of pregnancy...|$|R

It is unknown why some people developed this type. Historically, it accounted for 5–10 percent of cases, and the majority (72 percent) were children. Malignant smallpox was accompanied by a severe prodromal phase that lasted 3–4 days, prolonged high fever, and severe symptoms of <b>toxemia.</b> The rash on the tongue and palate was extensive. Skin lesions matured slowly and by the seventh or eighth day they were flat and appeared to be buried in the skin.

Furthermore, in man it has been established by the work on erythroblastosis foetalis (7) that specific cytotoxic antibodies may arise naturally and cause serious or fatal disease.

Primary bacterial virulence factors are Shiga toxin types 1 and 2 (Stx 1 and Stx 2), and we performed parallel analyses of the pathophysiologies elicited by the toxins in nonhuman primate models to identify shared and unique consequences of the <b>toxemias.</b> After a single intravenous challenge with purified Stx 1 or Stx 2, baboons (Papio) developed thrombocytopenia, anemia, and acute renal failure with loss of glomerular function, in a dose-dependent manner. Differences in the timing and magnitude of physiologic responses were observed between the toxins. The animals were more sensitive to Stx 2, with mortality at lower doses, but Stx 2 -induced renal injury and mortality were delayed 2 to 3 days compared to those after Stx 1 challenge.

25|$|Cutaneous anthrax {{infection}} in humans shows up as a boil-like skin lesion that eventually forms an ulcer {{with a black}} center (eschar), often beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot. Cutaneous infections generally form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure. Without treatment about 20% of cutaneous skin infection cases progress to <b>toxemia</b> and death. Respiratory {{infection in}} humans initially presents with cold or flu-like symptoms for several days, followed by severe (and often fatal) respiratory collapse. Historical mortality was 92%. Gastrointestinal infection in humans is most often caused by eating anthrax-infected meat and is characterized by serious gastrointestinal difficulty, vomiting of blood, severe diarrhea, acute inflammation of the intestinal tract, and loss of appetite. After the bacteria invades the bowel system, it spreads through the bloodstream throughout the body, making more toxins on the way.|$|E
25|$|When larvae of Lucilia feed parasitically {{they cause}} the disease facultative myiasis (facultative = {{opportunistic}} or optional). When this occurs on sheep {{it is often}} known as blow-fly strike. This causes severe distress to the host and may be fatal due to <b>toxemia</b> from ammonia excreted by masses of infesting larvae. Females of Chrysomya, Cochliomyia and Wohlfahrtia and similar genera always seek out their host such as cattle, sheep, dogs, to lay their eggs at vulnerable sites such as a small wound. The larvae hatch and rapidly invade the superficial layers of skin to continue feeding there until ready to pupate. This form of parasitism is essential for these types of fly, and causes obligate myiasis (obligate = necessary or essential). This infestation develops into severe disease and can be fatal if the infestation is at a vulnerable site such as ear or navel of the host. Adult blow-flies {{such as those in}} the Calliphora genus can be significant as transmitters of various bacteria involved in mastitis of cattle. The conjunctivitis of cattle known as pink-eye is caused by Moraxella bovis bacteria and may be transmitted by blow-flies.|$|E

40|$|Interest in the {{possibility}} that the placenta contains organ-specific antigens was stimulated {{at the beginning of the}} century by the suggestion that some <b>toxemias</b> of pregnancy might result from maternal sensitization against placental antigens, leading secondarily to renal damage (1). The general principle that an antiserum raised in one species against placental homogenates from a different species will interrupt pregnancy in individuals of the species that provided the antigen has been well established since Dobrowolski's (2) work with guinea pigs and rabbits (see reference 3). Contaminating erythrocytes have been exonerated as the effective antigens and the strong nephrotoxic activity of many anti-placental sera established (4 - 6). However, it seems fairly well documented that potent nephrotoxic anti-kidney sera are not necessarily placentotoxic (7, 8). The nature and distribution of the antigens apparently shared in common by the placenta and kidney have been subjected to repeated investigations mainly of an in vitro nature (6, 8 - 13).

40|$|The Clostridium {{perfringens}} e-toxin is {{an extremely}} potent toxin associated with lethal <b>toxemias</b> in domesticated ruminants and may be toxic to humans. Intoxication results in fluid accumulation in various tissues, most notably {{in the brain and}} kidneys. Previous studies suggest that the toxin is a pore-forming toxin, leading to dysregulated ion homeostasis and ultimately cell death. However, mammalian host factors that likely contribute to e-toxin-induced cytotoxicity are poorly understood. A library of insertional mutant Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, which are highly susceptible to the lethal affects of e-toxin, was used to select clones of cells resistant to e-toxin-induced cytotoxicity. The genes mutated in 9 surviving resistant cell clones were identified. We focused additional experiments on one of the identified genes as a means of validating the experimental approach. Gene expression microarray analysis revealed that one of the identified genes, hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1 (HAVCR 1, KIM- 1, TIM 1), is more abundantly expressed in human kidney cell lines than it is expressed in human cells known to be resistant to e-toxin. One human kidney cell line, ACHN, was found {{to be sensitive to the}} toxin and expresses a larger isoform of the HAVCR 1 protein than the HAVCR 1 protein expressed by other, toxin-resistant human kidney cell lines.

40|$|The {{extent to}} which {{acquired}} immunity participates in protecting against staphylococcal infection is not clear. Considerable evidence would suggest that antibody to the staphylococcus and its products plays only a secondary role in modifying {{the nature of the}} lesion produced by the organism, and that nonspecific factors may be more important in determining host susceptibility (1). It has been shown, for example, that host susceptibility to staphylococcal infection may be markedly influenced by nutritional factors and other metabolic disturbances, as well as by <b>toxemias</b> and certain allergic reactions (2). However, the role of specific hypersensitivity to the staphylococcus and its products remains obscure. It has been stated that the understanding of acquired immunity and the utilization of this knowledge in the prevention and treatment of staphylococcus infections will probably await identification of the factors enabling the organism to establish infection and bring about damage to host tissues (2). To date, success in elucidating the pathogenesis of staphylococcal infection has been quite limited. Following the identification by Ogston of the staphylococcus as the probable etiologic agent in a variety of abscesses (3), a number of workers turned to the investigation of immunological problems related to staphylococcal infection (4 [...] 7). It was soon evident that vaccination with the organism failed to provide protection against infection {{in the same manner as}} was the case with a number of other bacterial diseases, and attention was thereafter focused upon the question of antitoxic immunity which, by analogy with diphtheria, was felt to be a more important mechanism of host resistance.

(3) There was no evidence of markedly increased urine estrogen levels in cases of twin pregnancy. (4) Urine total estrogen levels of 37 expectant mothers with <b>toxemias</b> of late pregnancy were lower than those of normal expectant mothers. The levels of estron and estradiol fractions were also lower in them than in normal expectant mothers.

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper from this {{laboratory}} (1) the blood urea clearance test was compared in nephritic subjects with {{other measures of}} renal function, namely, the concentrations of urea, creatinine, and hemo-globin in the blood, and the two-hour excretion of phenolsulphone-phthalein. In the present paper the blood urea clearance test is simi-larly compared with the concentration of uric acid in the blood. After the introduction of Folin's micro methods of blood analysis, some evidence accumulated to show that {{in the course of}} a progres-sive nephritis, uric acid was the first nitrogenous waste product to be increased in the blood, and that its estimation could be used as the most delicate indicator of early impairment of renal function (2, 3). At the same time, it was appreciated that in the terminal stages of nephritis the increase of uric acid did not parallel the increase of the creatinine, nonprotein nitrogen, or urea (4). It was subsequently shown that in patients with essential hypertension the blood uric acid was often distinctly elevated, and bore no prognostic signifi-cance (5). Hitzenberger and Richter-Quittner (6) found in two such patients that the endogenous excretion of uric acid was slightly above normal, and that they responded to high purine diets by the prompt excretion of large amounts of uric acid. Further doubt was then cast on the validity of the blood uric acid determination as an index of renal function by reports of its increase in many unrelated conditions. Gout, leukemia, and pneumonia had for many years been known to cause this increase, but newer work indicated that in addition, a rise in the level of blood uric acid could be found in pernicious anemia (7), carbon monoxide poisoning (8), <b>toxemias</b> of pregnancy (9), erythemia (10), eczema (11), and durin...|$|R
