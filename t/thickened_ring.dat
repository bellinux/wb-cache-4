50|$|Bandl's ring (also {{known as}} {{pathological}} retraction ring) is the abnormal junction {{between the two}} segments of the human uterus, which is a late sign associated with obstructed labor. Prior to the onset of labour, the junction between the lower and upper uterine segments is a slightly <b>thickened</b> <b>ring.</b> In abnormal and obstructed labours, after the cervix has reached full dilatation further contractions cause the upper uterine segment muscle fibres myometrium to shorten, so that the actively contracting upper segment becomes thicker and shorter. The ridge of the pathological ring of Bandl's can be felt or seen rising as far up as the umbilicus. The lower segment becomes stretched and thinner and if neglected may lead to uterine rupture.It is Major pathology behind obstructed labor.A circular groove encircling the uterus is formed between the active upper segment and the distended lower segment. Due to pronounced retraction, there is fetal jeopardy or even death.|$|E

40|$|The North Tank Farm (NTF) and the South Tank Farm (STF) {{located at}} ORNL {{contains}} 8 underground waste storage tanks which were built around 1943. The tanks {{were used to}} collect and store the liquid portion of the radioactive and/or hazardous chemical wastes produced as part of normal facility operations at ORNL, but are no longer part of the active Low Level Liquid Waste system of the Laboratory. The tanks were constructed of gunite. The six STF tanks are 50 ft in diameter, and have a 12 ft sidewall, and an arched dome rising another 6. 25 ft. The sidewall are 6 in. thick and have an additional 1. 5 in. gunite liner on the inside. There is a <b>thickened</b> <b>ring</b> at the wall-dome juncture. The dome consists of two 5 in. layers of gunite. The two tanks in the NTF are similar, but smaller, having a 25 ft diameter, no inner liner, and a dome thickness of 3. 5 in. Both sets of tanks have welded wire mesh and vertical rebars in the walls, welded wire mesh in the domes, and horizontal reinforcing hoop bars pre-tensioned to 35 to 40 ksi stress in the walls and <b>thickened</b> <b>ring.</b> The eight tanks are entirely buried under a 6 ft layer of soil cover. The present condition of the tanks is not accurately known, since access to them is extremely limited. In order to evaluate the structural capability of the tanks, a finite element analysis of each size tank was performed. Both static and seismic loads were considered. Three sludge levels, empty, half-full, and full were evaluated. In the STF analysis, the effects of wall deterioration and group spacing were evaluated. These analyses found that the weakest element in the tanks is the steel resisting the circumferential (or hoop) forces in the dome ring, a fact verified separately by an independent reviewer. However, the hoop steel has an adequate demand/capacity ratio. Buckling of the dome and the tank walls is not a concern...|$|E
40|$|Despite its {{terrestrial}} mode of life, Cardisoma carnifex (Gecarcinidae) {{returns to}} the sea to breed, and its spermatozoon displays all of the diagnostic features of thoracotreme sperm: absence (clearly loss) of the acrosome ray zone; presence of an apical button filling an opercular perforation; concentric lamellation of the outer acrosome zone; and the near-horizontal accessory opercular ring. In contrast, Varuna litterata (Grapsidae, subfamily Varuninae), a freshwater species, though again returning to marine (or estuarine) conditions to breed, shows only a negative state, absence of acrosome rays (other than a questionable presence of concentric lamellae) which would place it in the Thoracotremata. It does not display the grapsid synapomorphy, loss of the <b>thickened</b> <b>ring.</b> The distinctness spermatologically of Varuna from other grapsids is susceptible {{to a number of}} explanations among which are: (1) it is not a grapsid but a thoracotreme descended from a stock which had not yet developed typical thoracotreme spermatozoal ultrastructure; (2) it is a grapsid which has lost typical thoracotreme spermatozoal ultrastructure; (3) it is a heterotreme which has developed a thoracotreme configuration of genital pores independently of true thoracotremes. Of these alternatives, (3) is considered unacceptable, but the choice between (1) and (2) is difficult, although classical taxonomy would favour alternative (2). Absence of a recognizable acrosome ray zone, in Varuna sperm, presence of which is a typical heterotreme feature is also noted for the heterotremes Potamonautes, Potamon (Potamidae), and Australocarcinus (Goneplacidae), all of which are freshwater genera...|$|E
40|$|Various {{aspects of}} the {{reproductive}} anatomy of the spider crab Inachus phalangium are investigated utilizing light and electron microscopy. Spermatozoal ultrastructure reveals {{the presence of a}} glycocalyx in the peripheral region of the periopercular rim, never recorded before in crustacean sperm cells. Sperm cell morphological traits such as semi-lunar acrosome shape, centrally perforate and flat operculum, and absence of a <b>thickened</b> <b>ring,</b> are shared only with Macropodia longirostris, confirming a close phylogenetic relationship of these species and their separation from {{the other members of the}} family Majidae. Spermatozoa are transferred to females inside spermatophores of different sizes, but during ejaculate transfer, larger spermatophores might be ruptured by tooth-like structures present on the ejaculatory canal of the male first gonopod, releasing free sperm cells. Such a mechanism could represent the first evidence of a second form of sperm competition in conflict with sperm displacement, the only mechanism of sperm competition known among Brachyura, enabling paternity for both dominant and smaller, non-dominant, males. In addition, we propose several hypotheses concerning the remote and proximal causes of the existence of large seminal receptacles in females of I. phalangium. Among these, genetically diverse progeny, reduction of sexual harassment and phylogenetic retention seem the most plausible, while acquisition of nutrients from seminal fluids, demonstrated in other arthropods, and suggested by previous studies, could be discarded on the basis of the presented data. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

50|$|Like {{other members}} of the family Sarcoscyphaceae, Wynnea species have multinucleate ascospores and paraphyses. The ascus has a <b>thickened</b> apical <b>ring</b> capped by a hinged operculum; its opening often is {{oriented}} obliquely, a condition referred to as suboperculate. Three structural components are involved in spore discharge in Wynnea species: the operculum, the suboperculum, and the zone of dehiscence.

40|$|In 1946 Raven, {{working with}} {{sections}} of Limnaea eggs, described numerous vacuoles {{appearing in the}} ectoplasm at the 40 cell stage. Their content was strongly eosinophilic and with all stains used the colour of the vacuole content corresponded {{to that of the}} egg capsule fluid surrounding the egg. During the development of the egg the albumen vacuoles became larger and larger, occupying at the 120 cell stage {{a large part of the}} ectoplasm. Also at the 40 cell stage small conical or hemispherical vesicular protrusions could be observed on the surface of some blastomeres. Others had the appearance of small <b>thickened</b> <b>rings</b> of variable diameter, protruding slightly above the surface of the cells and surrounding a crater-like field. At the 120 cell stage their number had increased considerably and 40 - 60 of such ringlets were observed in most eggs. Since the formation of the ringlets corresponds in time to the absorption of albumen by the cells, Raven put forward the hypothesis that they represent inlets destined for the ingestion of egg capsule fluid by the developing egg. In order to test this hypothesis it seemed worthwile to study these structures by electron microscopy...|$|R

40|$|Features of the {{spermatozoon}} of Calocarcinus africanus {{which are}} general for heterotremes and endorse its {{inclusion in the}} Heterotremata are: extension of the subacrosomal chamber almost to the anterior apex of the sperm, presence of an acrosome ray zone, and presence of a <b>thickened</b> <b>ring</b> where the capsule surrounds {{the base of the}} subacrosomal chamber. A feature shared with “higher” heterotremes is the restriction of cytoplasm to the periacrosomal region, the arms being nuclear only, in contrast with invasion of their chromatin with cytoplasm and microtubules in majids; and loss of a posterior median process, containing chromatin, which is present in majids as in raninids and homolids. The relationship of Calocarcinus with xanthids is unequivocally supported by (1) presence of a posterior circumperforatorial zone, the xanthid ring; (2) the precise form of the acrosome ray zone which is wide anteriorly and sends a long slender extension posteriorly to meet the ring; (3) the irregular external margin of the outer acrosome zone; (4) division of the operculum complex into a distinct upper zone and a lower, subopercular zone of lesser diameter; and (5) presence of an accessory ring around the operculum. Modification of the xanthid ring is typical of thoracotremes and partial modification in Calocarcinus may indicate origin of thoracotremes from a related xanthoid stock. A difference of Calocarcinus sperm from those of xanthids is the (plesiomorphic) presence of cen trio les, also seen in some heterotremes and thoracotremes. No synapomorphies which are not common to other heterotremes are shared between Calocarcinus and trapeziid sperm. Trapeziid sperm (plesiomorphically?) lack the xanthid ring, the posterior extension of the acrosome ray zone and the irregular margin of the outer acrosome zone of Calocarcinus and xanthids. Apomorphic features of the Calocarcinus africanus sperm include a spiral configuration of the contents of the outer acrosome zone (autapomorphy?), as seen in cross-section, and presence of a periopercular rim. A well developed periopercular rim is known elsewhere only in Potamonautes (family Potamidae), but a rudiment occurs in some xanthids (e. g., Etisus). The periopercular rim is probably a true synapomorphy indicative of relationship of potamids to xanthoids (represented by Calocarcinus) which has been postulated elsewhere on morphological grounds...|$|E

40|$|A healthy Cha'topterus {{introduced}} {{into a glass}} tube rapidly lines this with a parchment-like secretion. One individual, after living in such a tube for two weeks, extended the lining beyond the aperture of the tube at one end. The prolongation was sharply constricted, showed suc cessive <b>thickened</b> <b>rings,</b> and terminated in an expanded rim; it was, in fact, an exaggeration of the constriction {{at the end of}} a normal tube. The tube current in such a preparation, as is well known, enters the tube anteriorly and leaves posteriorly, maintained by the rhythmic beat ing of the fans on segments 14, 15, and 16. It is weak ventral to the animal, but strong dorsally, and is directed under the arch formed by the long parapodia of segment 12. This main tube current provides the food supply, the nature of which has been described by Enders (1909). The collecting mechanism has been described by several authors as follows: the broad ciliated buccal funnel collects directly from an extensive antero-ventral field; in addition, ciliated grooves on the dorsal side of the thorax collect froni the tube current. To demonstrate this when the animal is removed from its tube, food particles must be supplied by dropping them onto the thorax from a pipette. Such particles are collected in a niucoid stream into grooves along the inner edge of the arch formed by the parapodia of segment 12, and pass from this anteriorly in a median groove. Particles which happen to fall on the ventral face of the thorax are passed in laterally moving streams dorsally, between some of the posterior parapodiaâ€”being thus brought into the dorsal collecting field. The median dorsal groove does not lead directly into the mouth, but ends blindly in a dilatation posterior to the dorsal lip overhanging the mouth (Fig. 1). The wall round the terminal dilatation is thickened and raised, and forms a three-lobed prominence. The anatomical details of the structure of the groove have been given by Joyeux-Laffuie (1890) ...|$|R

Then the growth of medullary vascular bundles is essentially minimal, while the peripheral vascular bundles produce xylem and phloem from a fascicular cambium, eventually exceeding the medullary vascular bundles, and wide rays fully separate the sclerenchymatous ring, which becomes discontinuous (Fig.  2 d). The species P. betle showed this type of development.|$|R
40|$|A ring {{composed}} {{largely of}} microfilaments is situated underneath the pellicle {{and at the}} base of the cleavage furrow in the ciliate Nassula during binary fission. The microfilaments have diameters ranging from 4 to 10 run. There are substantial indications that the ring actively constricts in a sphincter-like fashion and is the main contractile agent causing furrowing. As cleavage proceeds the <b>ring</b> <b>thickens</b> and the dense layer of the pellicle becomes progressively more deeply folded. The longitudinal axes of the folds are at right angles to the longitudinal axes of the microfilaments and the plane of the ring. Folds form only where the pellicle overlies the ring. Two distinct phases of cleavage have been distinguished. The furrow constricts the organism at a progressively more rapid rate until the cleavage constriction has a diameter of about 5 /im and the microfilaments plug the constriction. After this furrowing proceeds much more slowly. A girdle of several thousand microtubules embedded in a densely staining material forms between the ring and the pellicular folds during the final stages of cleavage. Constriction and severance of the narrow cleavage constriction joining daughter oiganisms during the final phase of cleavage involve mechanisms different from those acting during the earlier phase of furrow development...|$|R
