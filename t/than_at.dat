More athletes (50 in total, including more female athletes than ever before) competed for Jamaica in Beijing <b>than</b> <b>at</b> any previous Games, more gold medals were won (6 in Beijing alone, almost doubling the number of gold medals won in Jamaica's Olympic history) and more medals were won overall (11 medals, besting Jamaica's showing at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where 9 medals were won).|$|E
5|$|Although {{usually more}} coins were struck at Philadelphia <b>than</b> <b>at</b> the other mints {{during the years}} the coin was struck in silver, only 12,450,181 were struck there in 1955, fewer <b>than</b> <b>at</b> the Denver Mint or at San Francisco. This was due to a sagging economy and a lackluster demand for coins that caused the Mint to {{announce}} in January that the San Francisco Mint would be shuttered {{at the end of}} the year. The 1955 dimes from the three facilities are the lowest mintages by date and mint mark among circulating coins in the series, but are not rare, as collectors stored them away in rolls of 50.|$|E

5|$|A 2006 {{study by}} Milan Ćirković and colleagues {{extended}} {{the notion of}} a time-dependent galactic habitable zone, analyzing various catastrophic events as well as the underlying secular evolution of galactic dynamics. The paper considers that the number of habitable planets may fluctuate wildly with time due to the unpredictable timing of catastrophic events, thereby creating a punctuated equilibrium in which habitable planets are more likely at some times <b>than</b> <b>at</b> others. Based on the results of Monte Carlo simulations on a toy model of the Milky Way, the team found that the number of habitable planets is likely to increase with time, though not in a perfectly linear pattern.|$|E

5|$|An {{advantage}} held by Eurostar is {{the convenience}} {{and speed of}} the service: with shorter check-in times <b>than</b> <b>at</b> most airports and hence quicker boarding and less queueing and high punctuality, it takes less time to travel between central London and central Paris by high-speed rail than it does by air. Eurostar now has a dominant share of the combined rail–air market on its routes to Paris and Brussels. In 2004, it had a 66% share of the London–Paris market, and a 59% share of the London–Brussels market. In 2007, it achieved record market shares of 71% for London–Paris and 65% for London–Brussels routes.|$|E

The View appearance was partly intended to help soften her public image, and it was widely covered in the press.|$|E
