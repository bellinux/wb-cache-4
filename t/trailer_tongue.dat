5000|$|The swivel adapter, more {{commonly}} referred to as a swivel coupler or swivel hitch, functions by connecting one end to the <b>trailer</b> <b>tongue</b> and the other end directly to the hitch on the tow vehicle or to a coupler. This mechanism is engineered to rotate on the vertical axis so as to eliminate the possibility of coupler binding. As a result, the motorcyclist is able to lean into a turn as far as necessary at high speeds while keeping the trailer upright.|$|E
5000|$|Two-wheel {{tractors}} {{existed in}} the U.S. at least as early as 1913, when the Detroit Tractor Company advertised a tractor whose operator, riding on the implement, controlled the tractor via reins, just as he would a horse team. By 1918, the Moline Plow Company's Moline Universal Tractor likewise relied on its implement to supply the rear wheels in a four-wheel articulated unit, though its design dispensed with the long <b>trailer</b> <b>tongue</b> and horse reins. A 1918 example of Moline advertising called the Universal [...] "the original two-wheel tractor", which was a fanciful claim {{in light of the}} Detroit Tractor and other machinery described with that phrase from 1913 through 1915. But Moline Plow no doubt felt pressured to claim priority in response to a very similarly built competitor, the Allis-Chalmers Model 6-12, which Moline Plow alleged was a patent-infringing copy.|$|E
5000|$|To {{connect the}} second {{of a set of}} doubles to the first trailer, and to support the front half of the second trailer, a {{converter}} gear known as a [...] "dolly" [...] is used. This has one or two axles, a fifth-wheel coupling for the rear <b>trailer,</b> and a <b>tongue</b> with a ring-hitch coupling for the forward trailer. Individual states may further allow longer vehicles, known as [...] "longer combination vehicles" [...] (or LCVs), and may allow them to operate on roads other than Interstates.|$|R
5000|$|Before the 1940s, most {{hitching}} of {{farm implements}} to tractors was done simply with a drawbar, {{on the same}} principle as a modern tow hitch. The drawbar was a flat bar with holes in it, and the implements were <b>trailers,</b> with <b>tongues</b> that attached to the drawbar with a pin through a hole. The main reason why this was the default hitching idea {{is that it was}} the natural follow-on from the days of horse-drawn implements, which were towed as trailers by the horse or team (and often had an operator's seat). In fact, for decades during the mechanisation of agriculture in Europe and North America, as tractors gradually replaced horses in increasing degrees, existing implements from the horse era were often what the tractor pulled. Towing with a drawbar is a good, practical system for many purposes, and it has continued to be used even up to today, but the three-point hitch outperforms it in several ways (described below).|$|R
