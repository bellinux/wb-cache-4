Therefore, datasheets of 118 accelerometers from 27 manufacturers of eight countries have been analyzed. Focus of the analysis were the parameters overload shock limit, measurement range, frequency response, resonance frequency, volume, weight, power consumption and operating temperature of both uniaxial and <b>triaxial</b> <b>accelerometers.</b> Accelerometers with overload shock limits in the range of 50 g to 200 x 103 g and within a measurement range of 2 g to 110 x 103 g have been analyzed.

This paper investigates whether <b>triaxial</b> <b>accelerometers</b> can provide crucial flight regime information for helicopter gearbox monitoring systems.

Therefore, identifying <b>triaxial</b> <b>accelerometer</b> error coefficients accurately and being with lower costs are of great importance to improve the overall performance of triaxial accelerometer-based strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS). In this study, a novel artificial fish swarm algorithm (NAFSA) that eliminated the demerits (lack of using artificial fishes’ previous experiences, lack of existing balance between exploration and exploitation, and high computational cost) of AFSA is introduced at first. In NAFSA, functional behaviors and overall procedure of AFSA have been improved with some parameters variations.

Because a MEMS gyro has a drawback of angle drift, its attitude data is often corrected by the data solved with accelerometers and magnetometers. This paper presents a static and scalar calibration method for accurate solving of attitude angles with MEMS <b>triaxial</b> <b>accelerometers</b> and <b>triaxial</b> magnetometers. Based on the facts that vector sum of <b>triaxial</b> outputs of <b>accelerometers</b> equals to the gravity acceleration, and vector sum of triaxial outputs of magnetometers equals to the geomagnetic vector, the error equations are established. Taking the sum of error squares as the objective function, a nonlinear least square method is applied to solve the optimal calibration parameters. A Kalman filter is used to suppress the random error of output signals of sensors. A precise triaxial turn table is used to vary the spatial attitude of the sensor module for data sampling. Output signals of sensors at 32 different attitudes are captured, and unknown calibration parameters are solved. It is found that the variation of the difference values between the attitude angles calculated with the calibrated parameters and the attitude angles indicated by triaxial turn table is around ± 1 º.

Unfortunately, the long-term use of accelerometers is limited by drift of the sensitivities and the offsets.

This work focuses on one such finding, namely, the need to consider additional sources of information about system vibrations. In this light, helicopter transmission vibration data, collected using <b>triaxial</b> <b>accelerometers,</b> were explored in three different directions, analyzed for content, and then combined using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to analyze changes in direc-tionality.

Methods: Fifty-eight children (31 boys and 27 girls, age range = 9 - 12 yr) performed the following activities in a field setting: sitting, standing, walking, running, rope skipping, playing soccer, and cycling. All children wore uniaxial and triaxial ActiGraph accelerometers on both the hip and the ankle. Four ANN models were developed using the following accelerometer signal characteristics: 10 th, 25 th, 75 th, and 90 th percentiles; absolute deviation; coefficient of variability; and lag-one autocorrelation. The accuracy of the models was evaluated by leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Results: The models based on hip accelerometer data correctly classified the activities 72 % and 77 % of the time using uniaxial and <b>triaxial</b> <b>accelerometer</b> data, respectively, whereas the models based on ankle accelerometer data achieved a percentage of 57 % and 68 %. The hip models were better able to correctly classify the activities walking, rope skipping, and running, whereas the ankle models performed better when classifying sitting.

The Newton-Raphson method was employed to solve the non-linear equations in order to obtain the scale factors and offsets.
