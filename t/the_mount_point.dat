40|$|Vibration {{isolation}} is commonly adopted by engineers {{to reduce the}} vibratory effect caused by building services equipment. However, {{the relationship between the}} amount of sound power transmitted to the floor and the interaction between <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> <b>points</b> of several machines is uncertain, as it is common to install several coherent machines on the same floor, for example, two water pumps of the same type in a plant room. We conduct an analytical study {{of the effects of the}} interaction between two coherent vibratory sources on the power transmitted to the floor. The study is based on two simple vibratory sources with a single contact point, two rectangular machine models of even-mass distribution with four symmetrical supports and the calculated mobilities of a simply supported concrete floor. We find that the total power obtained from coherent sources (point sources or machine models) differs considerably from that obtained from independent sources at some frequencies in a vibration isolation region. To predict the performance of isolators more accurately, the power transmissibility method proposed previously by Mak and Su should consider not only the effect of effective floor mobility and the interactions of <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> <b>points</b> of <b>the</b> same sources, but also the interactions of <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> <b>points</b> of different sources on the floor.

5000|$|Unix-like systems {{assign a}} device name to each device, {{but this is}} not how the files on that device are accessed. Instead, to gain access to files on another device, the {{operating}} system must first be informed where in the directory tree those files should appear. This process is called mounting a file system. For example, to access the files on a CD-ROM, one must tell the operating system [...] "Take the file system from this CD-ROM and make it appear under such-and-such directory". The directory given to the operating system is called <b>the</b> <b>mount</b> <b>point</b> - it might, for example, be /media. The /media directory exists on many Unix systems (as specified in the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) and is intended specifically for use as a mount point for removable media such as CDs, DVDs, USB drives or floppy disks. It may be empty, or it may contain subdirectories for mounting individual devices. Generally, only the administrator (i.e. root user) may authorize the mounting of file systems.|$|E

Since the dynamic AIS data is shared mostly without human interaction and is not flawless, the static AIS content edited manually may also be highly exposed to errors and mistakes due to the predominant human factor. In this work a simple vessel motion pattern approach is introduced to determine the probable foredeck/afterdeck location of the GNSS reference used by the AIS transponder, and to compare it with the hull parameters obtained from the static AIS data, {{in order to find}} the observable blunders in the static AIS configuration of <b>the</b> <b>mount</b> <b>point</b> of the GNSS reference antenna...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a file system that enables transparent encryption and decryption of files by using advanced, standard cryptographic algorithm, Data Encryption Standard (DES) [1]. Any individual, including super user, or program, that doesn't possess the appropriate passphrase for the directory which contains encrypted files cannot read the encrypted data. Encrypted files can be protected even {{from those who}} gain physical possession of the computer on which files reside [2]. ‘CifrarFS’, an encrypted file system using ‘File system in USEr space (FUSE) ’ maintains all the files in a specific directory in an encrypted form and decrypts them on demand. It encodes the file name while storing but decodes it while viewed from <b>the</b> <b>mount</b> <b>point.</b> We propose an idea of watermark in every encrypted file that is validated before decryption and also log all the operations on ‘CifrarFS’. It is a stackable file system that operates on top of ext 3. It does not need root privileges...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the {{enhancement}} of vehicle handling characteristics through the active kinematic control system (AKCS) is investigated. AKCS can improve the stability and ride comfort of a vehicle by automatically controlling suspension geometry {{in accordance with the}} running con-ditions of a vehicle. The variable roll centre suspension concept in a McPherson strut suspension is proposed, and lateral acceleration feedback control is derived to calculate the control input. The independent rear wheel steering system, which controls both rear wheels independently and actively, is also proposed. To achieve this, three suggested positions for controlling the suspension geometry are considered. The rst position is between <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> <b>point</b> of <b>the</b> lower arm of a McPherson front suspension and the vehicle body. The second position is between <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> <b>point</b> of <b>the</b> strut and the vehicle body. The third position is between <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> <b>point</b> of <b>the</b> lateral link of the multilink rear suspension and the vehicle body. In order to evaluate the handling performance, a 15 degrees of freedom full vehicle model is constructed using the commercial multibody analysis program ADAMS. The control inputs for integrated control of the front and rear suspensions are dened, and roll centre migration and vehicle behaviour are investigated. In step steering and double lane change manoeuvres, the simulation results demonstrate that integrated kinematic control can adjust the roll centre migration, by which the handling characteristics of the AKCS vehicle such as roll angle, lateral acceleration and yaw rate are much improved...|$|R

40|$|Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed January 7, 2011) Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 57 - 58) For high precision applications, flexure-based mechanisms have long been popular as they allow highly repeatable motion without problems such as backlash and stiction associated with other motion transfer linkages. In fact, due to the inherent simplicity of flexure mechanisms, these structures have found use in optical alignment, in positioning of cutting tools for high precision machining, {{as a basis for}} MEMS structures, and in wafer alignment for photolithography. This thesis discusses the development of a novel monolithic flexure-based structure used for the application of a tool onto a sample. The mechanism is arranged as a nested configuration of two independently moving platforms: the first acts as the reference frame for tool position while the second provides <b>the</b> <b>mount</b> <b>point</b> for the tool. Due to the compliance between the two structures, we obtain a measure of the contact load acting on the tool from the deflection of the two structures relative to each other. However, for the purposes of attaining repeatable positioning, the hysteresis inherent in the piezoelectric actuator used presents a problem. To address this issue, a disturbance observer (DOB) controller is applied in estimating and canceling the hysteresis nonlinearity of the actuator. DOB controllers are conventionally used to compensate against external disturbances. However, in this case, we treat the hysteretic behavior of the actuator as a combination of a bounded hysteresis operator and a linear dynamic system thus treating the hysteresis as a disturbance input to be canceled by the DOB. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the DOB in hysteresis compensation. Finally, we explore the application of this system for depth sensing indentation (DSI). To verify the performance of this system, indentation tests were performed on aluminum samples. The resulting hardness and elastic modulus determined through testing were shown to be close to literature values...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} {{an investigation into}} <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> <b>points</b> of a Roll Cage on car frame using finite element methods. On most of motorsports competitions vehicles or military purposes vehicles it is compulsory or highly recommended to fit a Roll Cage to the vehicle to prevent major damage {{of the car and}} protecting the occupants {{in the event of a}} roll-over accident. A critical point in the design of a roll cage is <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> <b>points</b> where <b>the</b> device is attached to the vehicle. A bad design of that part can result on a poor behaviour of the protection system on a crash event. Beam element model is constructed from a wireframe geometry of a representative roll cage to quantify the forces that the attachments points receive on a typical FIA test. Then, FE models of different mountings configurations are created and parametrical study is performed in order to provide guidance on how to improve mountings performance. Tests of two mountings specimens are carried to validate the FE models using a Rig created for this work...|$|R
