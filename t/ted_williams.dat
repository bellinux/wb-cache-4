5|$|In May 2000, Henderson was {{released}} by the Mets, and quickly {{signed as a free}} agent with the Seattle Mariners. In only his second game as a Mariner, on May 20, Henderson hit a leadoff home run, thus becoming the third player to hit a home run in four different decades (<b>Ted</b> <b>Williams</b> and Willie McCovey were the others, and Omar Vizquel became the fourth in 2010). Despite the late start, Henderson finished fourth in the AL in stolen bases (31).|$|E
5|$|SR56 {{is part of}} the California Freeway and Expressway System; it is {{not part}} of the National Highway System, a network of {{highways}} that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. In 2014, SR56 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 32,000vehicles between I-15 and the eastern terminus at <b>Ted</b> <b>Williams</b> Parkway, and 81,000vehicles between Carmel Creek Road and Carmel Country Road, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the freeway.|$|E
5|$|SR56 meets Carmel Valley Road and curves northward, passing Canyon Crest Academy {{before turning}} southeastward. The route passes over McGonigle Creek before {{intersecting}} Camino Del Sur, which serves the nearby Westview High School. Southeast of Camino Del Sur, SR56 curves back east, passing under Carmel Mountain Road without an exit. The route encounters exits with Black Mountain Road and Rancho Peñasquitos Boulevard in Rancho Peñasquitos in a primarily residential area before meeting its terminus at a diamond interchange with I-15. Past the bridge over I-15, the road continues as <b>Ted</b> <b>Williams</b> Parkway.|$|E

5|$|In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 500 {{home run}} club {{is a group}} of batters who have hit 500 or more regular-season home runs in their careers. On August 11, 1929, Babe Ruth became the first member of the club. Ruth ended his career with 714 home runs, a record which stood from 1935 until Hank Aaron surpassed it in 1974. Aaron's {{ultimate}} career total, 755, remained the record until Barry Bonds set the current mark of 762 during the 2007 season. Twenty-seven players are members of the 500 home run club. <b>Ted</b> <b>Williams</b> (.344) holds the highest batting average among the club members while Harmon Killebrew (.256) holds the lowest.|$|E
5|$|It {{was planned}} that SR67 {{would be the}} eastern {{terminus}} of SR56. On December30, 1980, the City of Poway included SR56 in the city plan extending east through the city to a northern extension of SR 125. In 1983, both the cities of San Diego and Poway supported the extension of SR56 to SR67, although the City of Poway wanted the route moved and had reservations about the freeway ending in the city. There are no plans to construct the portion of SR56 east of I-15. Several arterial roads connect {{the eastern end of}} the SR56 freeway with SR67, including <b>Ted</b> <b>Williams</b> Parkway, Twin Peaks Road, Espola Road (CRS5), and Poway Road (CRS4).|$|E
5|$|Mickey Vernon {{became the}} first manager of the Texas Rangers in 1961, serving for just over two seasons. Ron Washington has managed more games and seasons than any other manager in Rangers history. Before 2010, the only Rangers manager to have led the team to the playoffs was Johnny Oates, who also won the 1996 Manager of the Year Award with the Rangers. <b>Ted</b> <b>Williams</b> is the only Rangers manager to have been {{inducted}} into the Baseball Hall of Fame; Whitey Herzog, who {{was elected to the}} Hall in 2009 and will be inducted in July 2010, will become the only Rangers manager to earn induction as a manager (Williams was inducted for his playing career).|$|E

5|$|Prior to the draft, the Texas Rangers {{held the}} second lowest {{attendance}} in the American League, ahead {{of only the}} Cleveland Indians despite having Baseball Hall of Famer <b>Ted</b> <b>Williams</b> as manager at one point. They had moved from Washington, D.C., two years prior, and owner Bob Short expanded Arlington Stadium an extra 20,000 seats. Short was looking {{for some sort of}} way to boost attendance, and found it using fellow Texas native Clyde. When Clyde agreed to sign his rookie contract, part of the deal was to make his first two professional starts with the Rangers at their home field before heading to the minors to develop.|$|E
5|$|In early 1946, Jorge Pasquel and {{his four}} brothers, {{owners of the}} Mexican {{baseball}} league, siphoned campaign funds from the upcoming Mexican presidential election and used them to offer large salaries and signing bonuses to American baseball players. In some cases, the offers were triple the salaries being paid in the Major Leagues. Chandler deterred players from considering Mexican League offers by imposing a five-year ban from Major League Baseball to anyone who played in the Mexican League and did not return by April 1, 1946. In all, eighteen players played for the Mexican league despite the ban, including Mickey Owen, Max Lanier, and Sal Maglie. Vern Stephens initially agreed to play in Mexico as well, but returned before Chandler's April 1 deadline. <b>Ted</b> <b>Williams,</b> Stan Musial, and Phil Rizzuto were also offered lucrative contracts and incentives, but all eventually declined to play in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ted</b> <b>Williams,</b> {{whose mother}} was of Mexican {{heritage}} enlisted on May 22, 1942. Williams received his wings and commission in the Marine Corps on May 2, 1944. He was in Hawaii awaiting orders {{as a replacement}} pilot when the war ended. Williams returned to the States in December 1945 and was discharged from the Marines on January 28, 1946. On May 2, 1952, Williams was recalled to active duty due to the Korean War. After completing jet refresher training in the F9F Panther at Cherry Point, North Carolina, Williams joined VMF-311 in Korea. He flew 37 combat missions and had a narrow escape when he crash-landed a flak-damaged aircraft. Among the decorations he received was the Air Medal with two Gold Stars for meritorious achievement. Williams returned to the States and relieved from active duty with the rank of captain on July 28, 1953. Williams, who played professional baseball with the Boston Red Sox, was elected to baseball's Hall of Fame in 1966.|$|E

5|$|The Cardinals {{advanced}} to the World Series against the Boston Red Sox, whom they defeated four games to three. While the Cardinals were facing the Dodgers, the Red Sox faced a team of American League All-Stars in an exhibition match. During the game, <b>Ted</b> <b>Williams</b> injured his elbow. He recovered in time {{to play in the}} World Series, but manager Joe Cronin blamed the injury on having to wait for the three-game series to finish, and pushed for future tie-breakers to be a single game. Cronin got his wish in the American League, as the 1948 American League tie-breaker was only a one-game matchup. However, the National League hosted three more series-style tie-breakers in later seasons before converting to a single-game format.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{the fifth}} inning saw no more hits, and after a Keltner double, three Indians {{were out in the}} top of the sixth inning. The Red Sox began to fight back in the bottom of the sixth inning. After getting Pesky out, <b>Ted</b> <b>Williams</b> reached first base on an error by Gordon. Stephens struck out, and with two outs in the inning, Bobby Doerr hit his 27th home run of the season to make the score 6–3. No runs were scored in the seventh inning, though Bearden and Mitchell both reached base. The Indians were able to score another run in the eighth inning after Jim Hegan was {{intentionally}} walked. Bearden then hit a fly ball to Williams, who dropped it, allowing Hegan to score and making it 7–3 in the Indians' favor. The Indians were able to score one more run in the ninth when Robinson scored after Keltner grounded into a bases-loaded double play. Bearden got the final three Red Sox out in the bottom of the ninth, finishing the game with an 8–3 Indians victory and giving Bearden a complete game.|$|E

25|$|He {{once had}} a {{friendship}} with Ty Cobb, with whom he often had discussions about baseball. He often touted Rogers Hornsby as being the greatest right-handed hitter of all time. This assertion actually led to a split {{in the relationship between}} Ty Cobb and <b>Ted</b> <b>Williams.</b> Once during one of their yearly debate sessions on the greatest hitters of all-time, Williams asserted that Hornsby {{was one of the greatest}} of all-time. Cobb apparently had strong feelings about Hornsby and he threw a fit, expelling Williams from his hotel room. Their friendship effectively terminated after this altercation.
