5|$|Ross disagreed, {{reasoning}} {{this would}} only damage relations between Britain and Portugal, an undesirable prospect given the countries' common membership in NATO, the European Free <b>Trade</b> <b>Association</b> and more.

5|$|As of 1993, {{there were}} 40 timber-processing plants {{and a number}} of sawmills. Tawau Port is a major export and import gateway for timber {{especially}} from North Kalimantan. A barter trade has been formalised between East Kalimantan (now North Kalimantan) and Sabah with the creation of Tawau Barter <b>Trade</b> <b>Association</b> (BATS) in 1993. The association handles the cash-based trade of raw materials from Indonesia, but in recent years has focussed on timber industry. Other than timber, since British rule ended exports have traditionally been spices, cocoa and tobacco. Birds' nests are harvested at Baturong, Sengarung, Tepadung and Madai Caves by the Ida'an community. Tawau {{is one of the top}} cocoa producers in Malaysia, and the world together with Ivory Coast, Ghana and Indonesia. The town is the cocoa capital for both in Sabah and Malaysia. Cocoa production is mostly concentrated in the interior, north of the town, while palm oil production is concentrated along the roads to Merotai, Brantian, Semporna and Kunak. Both cocoa and palm oil are part of the large agriculture sector that has become the main income producer for the town.|$|E
5|$|The union {{rejected}} the offer on November 9 {{and asked for}} another bargaining session. The two sides met again as the deadline passed.

The NBPA was converted into a <b>trade</b> <b>association,</b> enabling the players as individual employees to participate in a class action antitrust lawsuit against the league, calling the lockout an illegal group boycott. Attorney David Boies, who represented the NFL owners in their 2011 lockout, agreed to represent the players and join Keesler, who also represented the players in the NFL lockout. On November 15, one group of NBA players (including Carmelo Anthony, Chauncey Billups, Kawhi Leonard, and Leon Powe) filed an antitrust lawsuit against the NBA in a California federal court, while another (including Anthony Tolliver, Ben Gordon, Caron Butler and Derrick Williams) filed their own suit against the NBA in a Minnesota federal court.
