5|$|The Pendolino has {{received}} bad publicity {{since the first}} units were taken in service for its serious reliability issues, mostly caused by technical problems with the tilting system and the couplers. The coupling problems grew particularly important with {{the expansion of the}} Pendolino network in 2006, requiring rapid on-the-fly coupling of two trains at intersection stations. Because the units often could not be coupled the train units had to be run as two separate trains running one after another. This consumed one extra <b>train</b> <b>slot</b> on the heavily used rail sections causing cascading timetable delays. Sometimes two trains would not separate after coupling them, caused by moisture in the couplers. Due to the problems VR ended the practice of coupling Pendolino trains on-the-fly at the two intersection stations; in Tampere in late 2007 and in Kouvola during autumn 2008.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses multi-carrier, multi-line train scheduling {{problems for}} forward and spot markets. Schedules resulting from solution of these train scheduling problems enable carriers to make customer commitments for serving forward contracts and to transport one-off-loads arising on spot markets. A <b>train</b> <b>slot</b> selection model based on multicommodity network flow concepts is developed for determining timetables {{for use in}} forward markets and a column generation methodology is proposed for its solution. The model considers needs of both shippers and carriers. The solution approach is embedded in a simulation-based iterative framework, where demand elasticity is explicitly treated. A combinatorial auction-based track capacity allocation framework is introduced to allocate residual track capacity among competing carriers seeking to run additional trains on an as-needed basis. Bid set construction techniques are proposed that allow carriers to express their preferences for track usage. A winner determination problem is formulated, solution of which provides the optimal allocation of track capacity among carriers. The potential benefits of collaborative operation among carriers in both markets were recognized. Collaborative decision-making (CDM) strategies are designed for scheduling trains to serve forward markets. Performances of these strategies are assessed in a carrier collaboration simulation-assignment framework. A train space leasing technique and a CA-based <b>train</b> <b>slot</b> creation approach are proposed to accommodate one-off-loads on previously scheduled and newly formed trains, respectively. Required techniques for bid set construction are developed. A WDP is formulated that seeks the optimal allocation of track access rights to bidders for the given bid sets. Implementation of the resulting train schedules will aid in creating efficient and cost-effective rail transport, resulting in a competitive and green alternative to truck transportation. Additionally, collaboration among competing carriers {{can lead to the}} formation of profitable trains that might otherwise have been underutilized and an ability of each carrier to serve a greater share of the freight market. The methodologies were specifically intended for solving large, real-world train scheduling problems...|$|E

40|$|The {{growing demand}} for railway {{capacity}} has led to high capacity consumption at times and a delay-sensitive network with insufficient robustness. The fundamental challenge is therefore {{to decide how to}} increase the robustness. To do so {{there is a need for}} accurate measures that return whether the timetable is robust or not and indicate where improvements should be made. Previously presented measures are useful when comparing different timetable candidates with respect to robustness, but less useful to decide where and how robustness should be inserted. In this paper, we focus on points where trains enter a line, or where trains are being overtaken, since we have observed that these points are critical for the robustness. The concept of critical points can be used in the practical timetabling process to identify weaknesses in a timetable and to provide suggestions for improvements. In order to quantitatively assess how crucial a critical point may be, we have defined the measure RCP (Robustness in Critical Points). A high RCP value is preferred, and it reflects a situation at which train dispatchers will have higher prospects of handling a conflict effectively. The number of critical points, the location pattern and the RCP values constitute an absolute value for the robustness of a certain <b>train</b> <b>slot,</b> as well as of a complete timetable. The concept of critical points and RCP can be seen as a contribution to the already defined robustness measures which combined can be used as guidelines for timetable constructors...|$|E
