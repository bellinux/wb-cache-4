25|$|Li Mi {{was pleased}} with Li Yuan's response, believing that Li Yuan was willing to support him, and from that point on, Li Mi and Li Yuan often {{exchanged}} messengers. Li Yuan's campaign against Chang'an thus went without opposition from Li Mi. Meanwhile, however, when Li Yuan arrived near Hedong, his army was bogged down by the weather, and with food running out, there were rumors that Eastern Tujue and Liu Wuzhou would attack Taiyuan. Li Yuan initially ordered retreat, but at <b>the</b> <b>earnest</b> opposition by Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin, continued to advance. After defeating Sui forces at Huoyi (霍邑, also in modern Yuncheng), he decided to leave a small contingent to watch over Hedong while advancing across the Yellow River into Guanzhong (i.e., the Chang'an region). Once he did, he headed for Chang'an himself, while sending Li Jiancheng to capture the territory around the Tong Pass region to prevent Sui forces at Luoyang from reinforcing Chang'an and Li Shimin north of the Wei River to capture territory there. Meanwhile, his daughter had also risen in rebellion in support of him, {{and she was able}} to gather a sizable army and capture some cities. She joined forces with Li Shimin and her husband Chai Shao. Soon, Li Yuan reconsolidated his forces and put Chang'an under siege. In winter 617, he captured Chang'an and declared Yang You emperor (as Emperor Gong). He had himself made regent (with the title of grand chancellor) and created the Prince of Tang. (Meanwhile, most of Sui territory did not recognize Emperor Gong as emperor and continued to recognize Emperor Yang as emperor and not as retired emperor.) He sent his nephew Li Xiaogong south, and Li Xiaogong was able to persuade the Sui cities in modern southern Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Chongqing to submit.|$|E

Hoffman's second film of the year was George Clooney's political drama The Ides of March, in which he played <b>the</b> <b>earnest</b> campaign manager to the Democratic presidential candidate Mike Morris (Clooney).

500|$|On mixed review, Andy Gill of The Independent, while {{describing}} Mars' [...] "impassioned shame" [...] on {{the lyrics}} called the track [...] "enjoyable".

Hankinson wondered why they [...] "made Quinn a total sociopath" [...] who went from [...] "dancing on desks" [...] to [...] "framing someone for child endangerment" [...] with great ease; VanDerWerff was also critical of these actions, and called Quinn's sabotage of Shelby's apartment [...] "a move that takes a potentially good character, played by a fine actress, and just guts her". Kevin P. Sullivan of MTV had a different view, and wrote that the [...] "storyline stuck out throughout the episode as the most interesting". He also noted that it was [...] "cathartic and definitely nice to see a sweeter Puck balance out <b>the</b> <b>earnest</b> craziness of Quinn". The final scene of the episode, when Puck kissed Shelby, was characterized as [...] "creepy" [...] and [...] "super awkward" [...] by Bell, as either [...] "super creepy" [...] or [...] "romantic" [...] by BuddyTV John Kubicek, as [...] "groan-inducing" [...] in the [...] "You're actually going to go there?"

[...] August Brown of the Los Angeles Times stated that [...] "the Femme Fatale tour gets its drama by largely erasing— or at least tweaking— the past.

Spears moved with an almost mechanical detachment, lightly shifting through dance routines without fully letting her body release itself.

500|$|Bryan Byun, of DVD Verdict, {{believes}} that Welling {{was the perfect}} choice for Clark Kent: [...] "I can't imagine a more ideal actor to play this superpowered farm boy than Tom Welling, with his wholesome, honest face and heroic good looks—Welling not only resembles Christopher Reeve physically, but has all of <b>the</b> <b>earnest</b> charm that made Reeve the quintessential Superman." [...] The Free Lance–Stars Ron Hedelt likened Welling's performances as Clark Kent to that of Christopher Reeve's performances in the Superman films, stating that Welling manages to portray a [...] "... sweet, unassuming teenager ..." [...] while showing Clark struggle with the truth about himself. Comics2Film's Rob Worley also wrote of the physical resemblance Welling has to Christopher Reeve, noting that the actor gave the character depth with his convincing portrayal of Clark's longing to fit in. When comparing Smallville's Clark Kent to Bryan Singer's Superman (Brandon Routh) in Superman Returns, Seattle Times Julia Waterhous found Smallville's Clark Kent to be the more intriguing character. Waterhous explained that {{this was due to}} the inner turmoil of Clark— not being able to tell those he loved his secret— and the fact that no matter what his faults were he continued to put others before himself, remaining [...] "... pure and good ...". She explained that this allowed the audience to become intimate with the character, something lacking in the film version. According to the Associated Press, Welling's popularity as Clark Kent on Smallville had fans of the show wishing he would take the role Routh received in Superman Returns.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{has been}} {{generally}} well received, being praised by many critics for its writing. In a 2009 review for Slate, Josh Levin wrote that [...] "The greatness of 'Stark Raving Dad' {{has a lot}} more to do with The Simpsons writing staff than with Jackson's voice-over talents. The show's scripters came up with a plot device far more ingenious than simply dropping the singer into Springfield." [...] Monica Collins of the Boston Herald also enjoyed the episode. On the day it first aired, she wrote that [...] "This episode is vintage Simpsons, crammed with divinely vulgar visual oddities. And Michael Jackson, of course, is just so weird anyway that he fits right in." [...] Mark Lorando of The Times-Picayune commented that [...] "throwaway lines on The Simpsons are funnier than the big punchlines on most so-called comedy series; [...] has layers of humor, satirical touches that enrich the story lines," [...] singling out jokes like the America's Funniest Home Video parody. [...] "The laughs are literally non-stop, and Jackson's unmistakable vocal presence [...] adds a thousand watts of star power." [...] In 2011, Television Blend's Eric Eisenberg named [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] the best episode of the entire series. He praised it for being heartful and stated that what [...] "prevents the episode from seeming artificial or manipulative is that the writing in the episode earns <b>the</b> <b>earnest</b> moments", and further elaborates that while [...] "strong emotions might be the hallmark of 'Stark Raving Dad,' it would be a sincere mistake to ignore how funny it is." [...] He concluded that the episode [...] "is perfectly constructed, is filled with both deep belly laughs and tears, and is simply the greatest episode of The Simpsons" ...|$|E
