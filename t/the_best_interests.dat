It discusses the impact child development theories have had on Arizona child custody cases. Additionally, it includes an overview of early Arizona Supreme Court cases and the implications it has on <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of <b>the</b> child. The thesis also provides insight to problems with Arizona courts and the actors involved with making the decision for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of <b>the</b> child. The investigation demonstrates a disconnection between judicial discretion and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of <b>the</b> child standard. An example from the United States Supreme Court case Troxel v Granville (1999) is reviewed to illustrate how courts discretion, in general, can be misused. Overall, court discretion in Arizona is liberal and the impact it has on child custody decisions can sometimes conflict with <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of <b>the</b> child...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the ways in which}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of <b>the</b> child has been used as an argument for state-authorized assessments of persons who are aspiring to parenthood, but who are not yet parents, i. e. of parent potential rather than parental performance. The policies included in the analysis concern three different areas in which assessment of parental potential is made: adoption, assisted reproduction and presumptive parents with intellectual disabilities. The status of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of <b>the</b> child as an argument for state-authorized assessments of parent potential, I argue, varies with the amount of involvement from state authorities that is needed in the process of creating a family. The state claims the right to assess the parent potential of individuals only when it contributes to the creation of families in which there are no or only partial biogenetic links between parents and child. This {{does not mean that the}} state does not aim to encourage women who belong to what is perceived as a risk group to refrain from having children.

40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} whether healthcare providers apply <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> principle equally to different resuscitation decisions. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was distributed to consultants, trainees in neonatology, paediatrics, obstetrics and 4 th medical students. It examined resuscitation scenarios of critically ill patients all needing immediate resuscitation. Outcomes were described including survival and potential long-term sequelae. Respondents {{were asked whether}} they would intubate, whether resuscitation was in <b>the</b> patients <b>best</b> <b>interest,</b> would they accept surrogate refusal to initiate resuscitation and in what order they would resuscitate. RESULTS: The response rate was 74 %. The majority would wish resuscitation for all except the 80 -year-old. It was in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of <b>the</b> 2 -month-old and the 7 -year-old to be resuscitated compared to the remaining scenarios (p value < 0. 05 for each comparison). Approximately one quarter who believed {{it was in a}} patient <b>best</b> <b>interests</b> to be resuscitated would nonetheless accept the family refusing resuscitation. Medical students were statistically more likely to advocate resuscitation in each category. CONCLUSION: These results suggest resuscitation is not solely related to survival or long-term outcome and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> principle is applied differently, more so at the beginning of life...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of <b>the</b> child {{standard}} {{has been}} the prevailing legal rule for resolving child custody disputes between parents for nearly forty years. Almost from the beginning, it {{has been the}} target of academic criticism. As Robert Mnookin famously argued in his 1975 article, “best interests” are vastly indeterminate – more a statement of an aspiration than a legal rule to guide custody decisionmaking. The vagueness and indeterminacy of the standard make outcomes uncertain and give judges broad discretion to consider almost any factor thought to be relevant to the custody decision. This encourages litigation in which parents are motivated to produce hurtful evidence of each other’s deficiencies that may have a lasting, deleterious impact on their ability to act cooperatively in the interests of their children. Despite these deficiencies, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> standard has proved to be remarkably durable. Although scholars as well as the American Law Institute have proposed reforms, legislative efforts to narrow <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> standard have been largely unsuccessful. A few states have adopted a rule that bases custody on parents’ caretaking, but at least one legislature rejected a court-imposed primary caretaking rule, reviving <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> standard. Repeated efforts by fathers’ groups to enact laws favoring joint custody have usually failed as well. <b>The</b> persistence of <b>best</b> <b>interests</b> presents a puzzle: Are the academic critics wrong or does something other than the utility of the rule explain the reluctance of policymakers to change the status quo? This Essay confirms the deficiencies of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> standard and seeks to explain its persistence despite its obvious limitations. First we argue that the standard’s entrenchment {{is the product of a}} gender war that has played out in legislatures and courts across the country for decades. Most substantive reforms have been perceived (usually accurately) as favoring either fathers or mothers, and thus have generated political battles between their respective advocates. The primary front in this war has been a protracted battle over joint custody. Fathers’ groups have lobbied hard for statutes favoring joint physical custody, but they have been opposed vigorously by women’s advocates. As a result of the standoff, little progress has been made (in any direction) toward replacing <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> standard with a custody decision rule that would narrow and guide the judicial inquiry. The Essay proceeds as follows. Part II describes the deficiencies of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> standard, focusing on the daunting verifiability challenges judges face in applying the standard. Parts III and IV explore the political economy explanation for the persistence of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> standard. Part III examines the gender war in legislatures, particularly the repeated battles over joint custody in recent decades. Part IV turns to the struggles to elevate the importance of domestic violence and parental alienation respectively as key factors in applying the standard. Part V focuses on the illusion of mental health expertise as the second key to the entrenchment of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> standard. We challenge the assumption that MHPs enable courts to escape <b>the</b> indeterminacy of <b>best</b> <b>interests</b> or guide them toward good custody decisions. Part VI proposes substantive and procedural reforms that can improve custody decisionmaking, potentially resulting in arrangements that conform more closely to the law’s policy goal...|$|R
