50|$|<b>Topology</b> <b>optimization</b> {{is a type}} of {{structural}} optimization technique which can optimize material layout within a given design space. Compared to other typical structural optimization techniques, such as size optimization or shape optimization, <b>topology</b> <b>optimization</b> can update both shape and topology of a part. However, the complex optimized shapes obtained from <b>topology</b> <b>optimization</b> are always a headache for traditional manufacturing processes such as CNC machining. To solve this issue, additive manufacturing processes can be applied to fabricate <b>topology</b> <b>optimization</b> result. However, it should be noticed, some manufacturing constraints such as minimal feature size also need to be considered during the <b>topology</b> <b>optimization</b> process. Since the <b>topology</b> <b>optimization</b> can help designers to get an optimal complex geometry for additive manufacturing, this technique can be considered one of DFAM methods.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the optimization of flexible components in mechanical systems {{thanks to a}} "fully integrated" optimization method which includes a flexible multibody system simulation based on nonlinear finite elements. This approach permits to better capture the effects of dynamic loading under service conditions. This process is challenging because most state-of-the-art studies in structural optimization have been conducted under (quasi-) static loading conditions or vibration design criteria and also because this ``fully integrated" optimization method {{is not a simple}} extension of static optimization techniques. The present paper proposes an approach based on a Level Set description of the geometry. This method leads to an intermediate level between shape and <b>topology</b> <b>optimizations.</b> Gradient-based optimization methods are adopted for their convergence speed. Numerical applications are conducted on the optimization of a connecting rod of a reciprocating engine with cyclic dynamic loading to show the feasibility and the promising results of this approach...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{parallel}} meshing technique using {{a combination}} between a local remeshing technique and repartitioning is presented. The meshing method is based on local mesh <b>topology</b> <b>optimizations</b> and is shown to work for all meshing applications from adaptive remeshing to mesh generation by using a minimal volume principle. Parallel remeshing is performed independently on each subdomain with fixed interfaces. A constrained repartitioning technique is introduced to move the interfaces between subdomains in an optimal way. Repartitioning and remeshing are iterated until a good mesh and a good partition are reached. Several examples are given for different meshing objectives. Application examples are shown with the commercial code Forge 3, devoted to large deformation analysis and equipped with the proposed remeshing technique...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} performing topological optimizations of distributed hash tables. Such hash tables include Chord and Tapestry and are a popular building block for distributed applications. Optimizing topologies over one dimensional hash spaces is particularly difficult as the higher dimensionality of the underlying network makes close fits unlikely. Instead, current schemes are limited to heuristically performing local optimizations finding the best of small random set of peers. We propose {{a new class of}} <b>topology</b> <b>optimizations</b> based on the existence of clusters of close overlay members within the underlying network. By constructing additional overlays for each cluster, {{a significant portion of the}} search procedure can be performed within the local cluster with a corresponding reduction in the search time.

50|$|<b>Topology</b> <b>optimization</b> is, in addition, {{concerned}} {{with the number of}} connected components/boundaries belonging to the domain.

40|$|Abstract: Lifetime {{evaluation}} of metallic components {{is one of}} the main subjects for many industries due to its importance for development of metal protection and conservation methods. Looking forward this information, several electrochemical techniques have been applied by practitioners. One of the most important is the so called Electrochemical Noise Study, which makes possible to measure potential or real fluctuations produced by kinetic variations along the corrosion process. This technique makes necessary to apply signal processing methods, including low frequency trend removal. Many statistical methods have been proposed to do so. In order to assess each method performance, it is a must to know exactly both trend and noise for a particular signal. Then, a statistical comparison can be carried out between noise extracted with different methods and real noise. With this purpose, sometimes signal is simulated by computer data generation. In this paper, a new approach is proposed for trend removal, using artificial intelligence techniques instead of statistical methods. With this purpose, we combined an interval signal processing with backpropagation neural networks. Data pre-processing, used <b>topologies,</b> <b>optimizations</b> and training process are exposed in detail. Results are analysed and conclusions drawn...|$|R

40|$|VIII International Conference on Computer Aided Optimum Design of Structures, Detroit, USASizing {{and shape}} {{structural}} optimization problems are normally stated {{in terms of}} a minimum weight approach with constraints that limit the maximum allowable stresses and displacements. However, <b>topology</b> structural <b>optimization</b> problems have been traditionally {{stated in terms of}} a maximum stiffness (minimum compliance) approach. In this kind of formulations, the aim is to distribute a given amount of material in a certain domain, so that the stiffness of the resulting structure is maximized (the compliance, or energy of deformation, is minimized) for a given load case. Thus, the material mass is restricted to a predefined percentage of the maximum possible mass, while no stress or displacement constraints are taken into account.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a stochastic reduced order modeling {{strategy for the}} quantification and propagation of uncertainties in <b>topology</b> <b>optimization.</b> Uncertainty aware optimization problems can be computationally complex due to the substantial number of model evaluations {{that are necessary to}} accurately quantify and propagate uncertainties. This computational complexity is greatly magnified if a high-fidelity, physics-based numerical model is used for the <b>topology</b> <b>optimization</b> calculations. Stochastic reduced order model (SROM) methods are applied here to effectively 1) alleviate the prohibitive computational cost associated with an uncertainty aware <b>topology</b> <b>optimization</b> problem; and 2) quantify and propagate the inherent uncertainties due to design imperfections. A generic SROM framework that transforms the uncertainty aware, stochastic <b>topology</b> <b>optimization</b> problem into a deterministic optimization problem that relies only on independent calls to a deterministic numerical model is presented. This approach facilitates the use of existing optimization and modeling tools to accurately solve the uncertainty aware <b>topology</b> <b>optimization</b> problems in a fraction of the computational demand required by Monte Carlo methods.

40|$|The ongoing {{demand for}} better {{performing}} designs, {{has resulted in}} an increase in the complexity of <b>topology</b> <b>optimization</b> problems. Traditionally, the majority of the corresponding computational cost comes from solving the analysis equations using linear finite elements (FE). In this thesis a <b>topology</b> <b>optimization</b> method is presented, that is based on the finite cell method (FCM). This higher-order fictitious domain method is, due to its decoupled geometry-, integration-, and analysis-mesh well suited for large-scale <b>topology</b> <b>optimization,</b> and reducing its corresponding computational cost. The use of a decoupled density and analysis mesh greatly reduced the computational cost of <b>topology</b> <b>optimization</b> compared to linear FEM. Especially in 3 D <b>topology</b> <b>optimization</b> examples, the computational cost has been decreased by more than a factor 10, while maintaining a high-resolution in the density field. The use of a larger length-scale can reduce the computational cost even more, which is especially beneficial for robust <b>topology</b> <b>optimization.</b> It is identified that the choice of the analysis system completely depends on the complexity of the optimization problem. Simple optimization problems showed great increase in computational efficiency using relatively low polynomial degree (p= 1, 2, 3), combined with more density elements per finite cell. For more difficult <b>topology</b> <b>optimization</b> examples, such as problems were the boundary conditions have to be enforced in the weak sense, or stress-constrained <b>topology</b> <b>optimization,</b> a more accurate analysis system is required, hence a larger polynomial degree should be used.
