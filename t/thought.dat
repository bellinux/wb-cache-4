The two major categories of short-period comets are Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and Halley-type comets. Halley-type comets, which are named after their prototype, Halley's Comet, are <b>thought</b> to have originated in the Oort cloud but to have been drawn into the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, whereas the JFCs are <b>thought</b> to have originated in the scattered disc. The centaurs are <b>thought</b> to be a dynamically intermediate stage between the scattered disc and the Jupiter family.|$|E

Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to Far Cry 3, but also other Ubisoft franchises like Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs. Evans-Thirlwell <b>thought</b> that the experience offered by Far Cry 4 was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel.

5|$|<b>Thought</b> {{process in}} the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical coherence) of <b>thought.</b> <b>Thought</b> process cannot be {{directly}} observed but {{can only be described}} by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo of <b>thought,</b> some people may experience flight of ideas, when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of <b>thought</b> is a global reduction in the quantity of <b>thought</b> and <b>thought</b> perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas. A pattern of interruption or disorganization of <b>thought</b> processes is broadly referred to as formal <b>thought</b> disorder, and might be described more specifically as <b>thought</b> blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, tangential thinking, derailment of <b>thought,</b> or knight's move thinking. <b>Thought</b> may be described as circumstantial when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E

40|$|Intrusive <b>thoughts</b> {{represent}} the cognitive construct which is manifested through internal, repetitive, unwanted and unacceptable <b>thoughts,</b> images or impulses. Intrusive <b>thoughts</b> {{may be present}} both in clinical and general population. Usual intrusive <b>thoughts</b> that occur in typical population can turn into pathological and lead to the occurrence of psychiatric disorders due to mistaken beliefs about an individual's intrusive <b>thoughts,</b> as well as due {{to the use of}} inappropriate strategies as a reaction to these <b>thoughts.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} emphasize the importance of the cohesion of theory of mind construct and the ability to understand the intrusive <b>thoughts</b> by reviewing the available literature. The theory of mind is the ability to understand and attribute different mental states to oneself and others - <b>thoughts,</b> wishes, desires intentions, etc. The research results show that the knowledge of <b>thoughts</b> is associated with the reporting on intrusive <b>thoughts,</b> and that people who have better results on theory of mind tasks at the same time effectively report on their own intrusive <b>thoughts.</b> Failure to report on intrusive <b>thoughts</b> and limited ability to understand the possibilities of consciousness control may adversely affect the therapeutic process...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Thoughts</b> {{of death}} are not {{regularly}} included in diagnostic instruments and rarely examined separately from <b>thoughts</b> of suicide. This exploratory study examined whether <b>thoughts</b> {{of death and}} <b>thoughts</b> of suicide affect the course of late-life depressive disorders. METHODS: In 378 depressed older persons, <b>thoughts</b> of death and <b>thoughts</b> of suicide were assessed using questions from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. After 2 [*]years, {{the presence of a}} DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of minor or major depression or dysthymia was assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology was administered every 6 [*]months up till 3 -year follow-up. RESULTS: Multinomial logistic regression showed that <b>thoughts</b> of death as well as <b>thoughts</b> of suicide predicted double depression at follow-up (OR[*]=[*] 2. 14 [95 % CI: 1. 04 - 4. 40] and OR[*]=[*] 6. 47 [95 % CI: 2. 22 - 3. 02], respectively), compared with patients without these <b>thoughts.</b> Results became non-significant when adjusted for baseline depression severity (OR[*]=[*] 1. 17 [95 % CI: 0. 52 - 2. 63] and OR[*]=[*] 2. 57 [95 % CI: 0. 79 - 8. 84], respectively). Mixed linear models showed that severity of depression was lowest in the reference group, while symptoms decreased more over time in those with either <b>thoughts</b> of death or suicide. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <b>thoughts</b> of death or with <b>thoughts</b> of suicide were more severely depressed at baseline and follow-up, with the highest risk of being depressed at follow-up for patients with <b>thoughts</b> of suicide. These associations could be explained by baseline depression severity. The results suggest that <b>thoughts</b> of death and <b>thoughts</b> of suicide are important risk markers in predicting the course of depression...|$|R

40|$|What {{do people}} do with <b>thoughts</b> {{they do not}} like? Psycholo-gists have {{suggested}} many mental actions that people can take to change unwanted <b>thoughts.</b> They can try to change those <b>thoughts</b> through deliberative self-persuasion or by searching for and exposing themselves to appropriate persuasive infor-mation (Maio & Thomas, 2007). People can try to change how they view their <b>thoughts</b> by reinterpreting or even trivializing them (Beck, 1993; Ellis, 1973; Gross, 1998). Indeed, what people think about their <b>thoughts</b> (metacognition) can influ-ence the subsequent impact those <b>thoughts</b> have (see Petty, Briñol, Tormala, & Wegener, 2007). Despite these efforts, unwanted <b>thoughts</b> sometimes per-sist. People can try to ignore these <b>thoughts,</b> negate them, sup-press them, correct for them, or think about something else, but unfortunately, these mental activities {{can be difficult to}} implement and do not always work in the intended ways (Wegner & Erber, 1992). For example, attempts to negate or suppress stereotypes and prejudice can backfire and produce an increase in unwanted <b>thoughts</b> (e. g., Gawronski, Deutsch...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{interest}} in future-oriented cognition in various areas of psychology, there is still little empirical data regarding the occurrence and nature of future-oriented <b>thoughts</b> in daily life. In this study, participants recorded future-oriented <b>thoughts</b> occurring in natural settings and rated their characteristics and functions. The results show that future-oriented <b>thoughts</b> occur frequently in daily life and can take different representational formats (more or less abstract), embrace various thematic contents (e. g. work, relationships) and serve a range of functions (e. g. action planning, decision making). The functions and characteristics of <b>thoughts</b> differed according to their temporal distance, with <b>thoughts</b> referring to the near future being more specific and serving action planning {{to a greater extent}} than <b>thoughts</b> concerning the far future. The characteristics of future <b>thoughts</b> were also related to affective content, with positive <b>thoughts</b> being more frequent, more specific, and associated with more visual images than negative <b>thoughts.</b> Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
