This linkage {{is used to}} create a [...] "golden master record" [...] containing the cleaned, reconciled data about the entity. The techniques used in MDM are the same as for record linkage generally. MDM expands this matching not only to create a [...] "golden master record" [...] but <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> <b>relationships</b> also. (i.e. a person has a same/similar surname and same/similar address, this might imply they share a household relationship).|$|E

Randomization is crucial for encryption schemes to achieve semantic security, a property whereby repeated usage of the scheme under the same key does not allow an attacker <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> <b>relationships</b> between segments of the encrypted message. For block ciphers, {{the use of an}} IV is described by the modes of operation.

How-ever, users share annotations largely for their own individual needs, such as bookmarking and involvement in online communities. Free tagging may also result in low-quality annotation data. In this paper, we introduce a tagging game designed as an incentive for users to share {{a large number of}} high-quality social annotation data while being entertained.

Different frequency of a same variation {{can be used}} as a genetic mark <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> <b>relationship</b> between populations in different areas. A complete comparison between human and chimpanzee structural variation also suggested that some of these may be fixed in one species because of its adaptative function. There are also deletions related to resistance against malaria and AIDS. Also, some highly variable segments are thought to be caused by balancing selection, but there are also studies against this hypothesis.|$|R
50|$|Comparing {{different}} embryonic {{stages of}} different animals {{is a tool}} {{that can be used}} <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> <b>relationships</b> between species, and thus biological evolution. This {{has been a source of}} quite some controversy, both now and in the past. Ernst Haeckel pioneered in this field. By comparing different embryonic stages of different vertebrate species, he formulated the recapitulation theory. This theory states that an animal's embryonic development follows exactly the same sequence as the sequence of its evolutionary ancestors. Haeckel's work and the ensuing controversy linked the fields of developmental biology and comparative anatomy into comparative embryology. From a more modern perspective, Haeckel's drawings were the beginnings of the field of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo).|$|E
50|$|Genetic {{genealogy}} {{is the use}} of DNA {{testing in}} combination with traditional genealogy and traditional genealogical and historical records <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> <b>relationships</b> between individuals. Genetic genealogy involves the use of genealogical DNA testing to determine the level and type of the genetic relationship between individuals. This application of genetics became popular with family historians {{in the first decade of}} the 21st century, as tests became affordable. The tests have been promoted by amateur groups, such as surname study groups, or regional genealogical groups, as well as research projects such as the genographic project. As of 2013 hundreds of thousands of people had been tested. As this field has developed, the aims of practitioners broadened, with many seeking knowledge of their ancestry beyond the recent centuries for which traditional pedigrees can be constructed.|$|E
50|$|Phylogenetic {{classification}} of asexually reproducing fungi now commonly uses molecular systematics. Phylogenetic trees constructed from comparative analyses of DNA sequences, such as rRNA, or multigene phylogenies {{may be used}} <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> <b>relationships</b> between asexually reproducing fungi and their sexually reproducing counterparts. With these methods, many asexually reproducing fungi have now been placed in the tree of life. However, because phylogenetic methods require sufficient quantities of biological materials (spores or fresh specimens) that are from pure (i.e., uncontaminated) fungal cultures, for many asexual species their exact relationship with other fungal species {{has yet to be}} determined. Under the current system of fungal nomenclature, teleomorph names cannot be applied to fungi that lack sexual structures. Classifying and naming asexually reproducing fungi is the subject of ongoing debate in the mycological community.|$|E

40|$|The {{commercial}} relationships between Autonomous Systems (ASes) are {{of great importance}} to understand the Internet reachability and calculate the AS-level paths. Several algorithms have been proposed to solve the AS relationship inference problem and applied to the data of IPv 4 network. In assuming that the provider is typically larger than its customers, and the peers usually have comparable sizes, the suggested algorithms exploit the AS degree information <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> AS <b>relationships.</b> In analysis of the AS relationships in the IPv 6 network, however, we find that {{quite a few of}} the inference results induced by the present approaches are different from the inferences in the IPv 4 network.
