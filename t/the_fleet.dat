5|$|According to the Athenian playwright Aeschylus, who {{actually}} fought at Salamis, the Greek fleet numbered 310 triremes (the difference being {{the number of}} Athenian ships). Ctesias claims that the Athenian fleet numbered only 110 triremes, which ties in with Aeschylus's numbers. According to Hyperides, the Greek fleet numbered only 220. <b>The</b> <b>fleet</b> was effectively {{under the command of}} Themistocles, but nominally led by the Spartan nobleman Eurybiades, as had been agreed at the congress in 481 BC. Although Themistocles had tried to claim leadership of <b>the</b> <b>fleet,</b> the other city states with navies objected, and so Sparta (which had no naval tradition) was given command of <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> as a compromise.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Mexico on 20 March, <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> {{underwent}} {{three weeks}} of target practice. Rear Admiral Evans was relieved of command during this time, as he was completely bedridden and in constant pain, so on 30 March, Connecticut set sail north at full speed. She was met two days later by the schooner , which took the admiral to a hospital. Connecticut traveled back south to rejoin <b>the</b> <b>fleet,</b> and Rear Admiral Charles M.

5|$|Benbow was {{occupied}} with the typical routine of gunnery drills and squadron exercises in January. <b>The</b> <b>fleet</b> departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February; Admiral John Jellicoe, {{the commander of}} the Grand Fleet, had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. On the night of 25 March, Benbow and the rest of <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> sailed from Scapa Flow to support the Battlecruiser Fleet and other light forces that raided the German zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a severe gale threatened the light craft. Iron Duke, <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> flagship, guided the destroyers back to Scapa while Benbow and the rest of <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> retired independently. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. <b>The</b> <b>fleet</b> returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft. The Grand Fleet did not arrive in the area until after the German High Seas Fleet had withdrawn, however. On 24 May, <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|By April 4, <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> {{reached the}} waters off Long Island and {{proceeded}} to capture , which was also laden with supplies. The next day brought a second prize in the Bolton. Hopkins continued to cruise off Block Island that night, hoping to catch more easy prizes. He organized <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> into a scouting formation of two columns. The right or eastern column was headed by USS Cabot and was followed by Hopkins' flagship USS Alfred, which had 20 guns and was the largest ship of <b>the</b> <b>fleet.</b> The left column was headed by the USS Andrew Doria and was followed by USS Columbus. Behind these came USS Providence, with USS Fly and USS Wasp trailing farther behind as escorts for the prizes.

50|$|<b>The</b> Chinese <b>fleet</b> {{was bigger}} and armed with bigger guns. <b>The</b> Japanese <b>fleet</b> was much faster.

So, as <b>the</b> Japanese <b>fleet</b> closed in, Li recommended the convoys be stopped, and that <b>the</b> Beiyang <b>Fleet</b> be kept within its naval stronghold in LÃ¼shunkou (Port Arthur). This narrow strip of water should minimize <b>the</b> Japanese <b>fleet's</b> speed advantage. This along with the stronghold's coastal defense should defeat <b>the</b> Japanese <b>fleet.</b> However, <b>the</b> Guangxu Emperor was enraged that <b>the</b> Japanese <b>fleet</b> was near Chinese territory, so he insisted that the convoys be continued and that <b>the</b> Japanese <b>fleet</b> be pushed back.|$|R

50|$|The loss of Yuyuan and Chengqing in February 1885 eroded <b>the</b> Nanyang <b>Fleet's</b> {{advantage}} over <b>the</b> Northern Seas <b>Fleet</b> (Beiyang <b>Fleet).</b> During <b>the</b> following decade <b>the</b> Nanyang <b>fleet</b> gradually lost its primacy, as Li Hongzhang {{invested heavily in}} <b>the</b> Beiyang <b>Fleet.</b> By 1894, {{on the eve of}} the Sino-Japanese War, <b>the</b> Beiyang <b>Fleet</b> had a comfortable superiority over <b>the</b> Nanyang <b>Fleet</b> both in numbers of ships and quality.|$|R
5|$|French and British patrol frigates each spotted <b>the</b> other's <b>fleet</b> around 9:30 am; both {{at first}} underestimated {{the size of}} <b>the</b> other <b>fleet,</b> leading each {{commander}} to believe <b>the</b> other <b>fleet</b> was <b>the</b> smaller <b>fleet</b> of Admiral de Barras.

5|$|In 1907, the Great White Fleet {{was ordered}} by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt {{to circle the}} world, as a {{demonstration}} of the might of the United States Navy. Kentucky was attached to the Fourth Division of the Second Squadron, and was commanded by Captain Walter C. Cowles, while <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> as a whole was commanded by Rear Admiral Evans, Kentuckys former flag officer. On 16 December 1907, <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> saluted the presidential yacht , and left from Hampton Roads. <b>The</b> <b>fleet</b> then sailed south, passing Trinidad and Rio de Janeiro, and going through the Straits of Magellan. From there she passed the west coast of South America, visiting Punta Arenas and ValparaÃ­so, Chile, Callao, Peru, and Magdalena Bay, Mexico. <b>The</b> <b>fleet</b> arrived at San Diego on 14 April 1908 and continued to San Francisco on 6 May. Two months later it arrived at Honolulu, and from there sailed to Auckland, New Zealand, arriving on 9 August.

5|$|In August 1914, {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet; Iron Duke remained the flagship of <b>the</b> <b>fleet,</b> now under Admiral John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe. On the evening of 22 November 1914, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea; Iron Duke stood with the main body in support of Vice Admiral David Beatty's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. <b>The</b> <b>fleet</b> was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November. Iron Duke and most of <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> initially remained in port during the German raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby on 16 December 1914, though the 3rd Battle Squadron was sent to reinforce the British forces in the area. After receiving further information {{about the possibility of}} the rest of the German fleet being at sea, Jellicoe gave the order for <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> to sortie to try to intercept the Germans, though by that time they had already retreated. Iron Duke went to sea with the 2nd and 4th Battle Squadrons for gunnery practice north of the Hebrides on 23 and 24 December. The following day, the rest of <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> joined Iron Duke for a sweep in the North Sea, which concluded on 27 December.|$|E
50|$|The name of {{the class}} {{was taken from the}} {{individual}} {{name of the}} first submarine Shch-301 Shchuka.

5|$|In July, <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> {{conducted}} squadron maneuvers in the North Sea, {{which included}} coast defense exercises with {{soldiers from the}} X Corps.
