Depending on the mature {{size and the}} purpose for which the onion is used, these may be {{referred}} to as pearl, boiler, or pickler onions, but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species. Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather <b>than</b> <b>as</b> an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a long-lasting relish.|$|E
5|$|After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and {{the closure}} of Vale Royal Abbey in 1538, St Padarn's Church regained its independence, though now solely as a parish church rather <b>than</b> <b>as</b> a {{religious}} community. The church remained important {{in part because the}} parish was {{one of the largest in}} Wales (over 240 square miles). However, although the Abbot of Vale Royal was no longer rector, the church did not recover the tithes, nor the ownership of the lands that had once belonged to the church.|$|E

5|$|An Lushan was a Tang {{general of}} mixed Turkic and Soghdian ancestry whose revolt between 755 and 763, the An Shi Rebellion, devastated the Tang Dynasty. Unlike the {{majority}} of Turkic military officers, An Lushan served the Tang as an official closely involved with {{the politics of the}} imperial court, rather <b>than</b> <b>as</b> a general in a garrison on the Tang frontier. The dynasty might have collapsed {{had it not been for}} their alliance with the Uyghur Turks. The rebellion diminished the Tang enthusiasm for cosmopolitanism that was a characteristic of the dynasty's earlier years.|$|E
5|$|Artists and {{craftsman}} operated as corporations (guilds) rather <b>than</b> <b>as</b> individual business. Inscriptions mention guilds of weavers, oilmen, artisans, {{basket and}} mat makers and fruit sellers. A Saundatti inscription {{refers to an}} assemblage {{of all the people}} of a district headed by the guilds of the region. Some guilds were considered superior to others, just as some corporations were, and received royal charters determining their powers and privileges. Inscriptions suggest these guilds had their own militia to protect goods in transit and, like village assemblies, they operated banks that lent money to traders and businesses.|$|E

She is classified as a 1.5 point player, but women get a 1.5 point bonus when playing on a mixed team, making her in effect a zero-point player. Her classification, along with her high technical acumen, means that she is a valuable asset on any team.|$|E

5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure new sources of revenue in order to {{supplement}} and increase royal income in a time when new demands were being made on royal finances.

Also new was the fact later collections were imposed with the consent of the barons. However, the main flow of royal income was from other sources, and carucage was not collected again after 1224.|$|E

5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{uses the}} unique molecular recognition properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties.

Nanomechanical devices and algorithmic self-assembly have also been demonstrated, and these DNA structures have been used to template the arrangement of other molecules such as gold nanoparticles and streptavidin proteins.|$|E
