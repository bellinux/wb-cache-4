500|$|In May 1993, Laura {{traveled}} to Attu and {{spoke at a}} 50th anniversary commemorative event of the Battle of Attu. [...] In her speech at the event, Laura stated [...] "How ironic <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> killed in combat against his beloved America while in loyal service to his Japanese homeland... Like my father, I too have a great love for Japan and America." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his memoirs, Holloway III {{complained that}} [...] "there {{has often been}} a tacit {{presumption}} <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> {{in a position to}} advance my career as I gained seniority in the Navy. On the contrary, as a retired officer he had little or no influence over his own future, much less mine." [...] As an example of this presumption, when President Richard M. Nixon approved Holloway III's nomination to succeed Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. as chief of naval operations, Zumwalt believed that Nixon acquiesced mainly to avoid overruling the recommendation of his secretary of defense, but that, [...] "In addition, and I really think this was a factor, Mr. Nixon remembered Jimmy's father from his own period of naval service." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{location}} of Moore's grave is not known. His grandson, John, said: [...] "The odd thing is <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> {{such a good}} story-teller but he couldn't or wouldn't tell me where my grandfather was buried. It was {{if there was some}} unfinished business, some sort of mix-up, something I never understood. It's a mystery." [...] Moore believes the site may be near the Welsh Harp reservoir – also known as Brent Reservoir – in north London. By chance, what {{is believed to have been}} the first cycle race in Britain took place at the Welsh Harp the day after Moore won in the Parc de St-Cloud. The race was won by Arthur Markham, who for many years had a bicycle shop nearby at 345 Edgware Road.|$|E
6000|$|... "But we know <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> near at hand, and, if Thayendanega grows {{careless}} or indifferent, will be tortured to death." ...|$|R
6000|$|STEPHEN [in utter consternation] Do {{you mean}} to say <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> coming here to-night--that he may be here at any moment? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gertie," [...] said Hans, {{patting the}} fingers which handed him his big Dutch pipe, [...] "I fear <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> {{determined}} to go." ...|$|R
60|$|MAUD. I mean <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> {{so angry}} that he didn't {{know what he was}} doing.|$|E
60|$|CHLOE. There's nothing; unless it's--[With a quick took at him,]-- Unless it's <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> a--a bankrupt.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{forgot to}} tell you <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> rather deaf,' said Elfride anxiously, when Stephen entered the little drawing-room.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I congratulate you,' Stephen whispered; {{and said}} aloud, 'I know Miss Swancourt--a little. You must {{remember}} <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> a parishioner of Mr. Swancourt's.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{we speak}} idly, and thou hast {{not seen the}} standard, and the banner, and the pennon of the Maid <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> painting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{gives me}} hopes <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> still alive," [...] Ronald said. [...] "Had he been dead {{they might have}} forced her into some other marriage." ...|$|R
60|$|I said I {{was from}} Graz; <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> {{a doctor in}} Graz, and that I was walking for my {{pleasure}} through the countries of Europe.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait, Marius!" [...] cried Florimond, and {{he looked}} {{genuinely}} aghast. [...] "Do not forget that we are brothers, men of the same blood; <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> your father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{may be very}} painful, but {{it ought}} to be made clear before you how you stand. You know <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> ruined--there's no word for it but ruined." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please do not {{say such}} absurd things! Explain to me at once {{what you mean by}} saying <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> being kept there by your orders." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} known my mother. I have no {{knowledge}} about her. I have never called any man <b>father.</b> But I <b>am</b> convinced <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> an Englishman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not going}} to trade on the fact <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> a United States senator," [...] remarked Roger, {{somewhat}} shortly. [...] "I am going {{to make my own}} way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; he {{went out}} first to make sure <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> coming, and then sent me to meet him {{that we might be}} alone. But Peter is close at hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, {{after your}} kind {{attention}} to me, I cannot do less than relieve any curiosity {{that you may}} feel. You must know <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> Stanislaus Stanniford, the banker." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could almost}} fancy, Carlo, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> right {{in using the}} name he did," [...] she said, as, {{recovering}} herself, she turned a reproachful look on his still excited features.|$|E
6000|$|... "My name is Fitzroy Hamilton," [...] I said, {{striving to}} speak in a {{friendly}} tone. [...] "Surely you know the Hamilton plantation, and <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> in the American army?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} is, Roger. My Uncle Dunston tells me <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> {{a very good}} {{horseman}} and <b>that</b> he and <b>my</b> mother used often to go out horseback riding together." ...|$|R
60|$|ELLIE [following {{him to stop}} him]. Oh, please--[He goes out]. Lady Utterword, I don't {{know what}} to do. Your father {{persists}} in believing <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> some sailor who robbed him.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} accidentally, {{on the night}} after that battle, that I learned <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> {{the heir to the}} Marquis of Langdale, and I thereupon {{obtained}} six months' leave, to come here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shoveling gravel on a {{railroad}} <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> grading," [...] said Ida, with rather grim amusement, {{for she was}} determined that the man should face the plain reality, even if it hurt him.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{mother told}} me. She said <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> a gentleman, and--that I looked like him. She would {{not tell me}} his name, because she had taken an oath never to reveal it to anyone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Promise me, promise me," [...] said Eleanor; [...] "say <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> safe;--one word will do. I {{know how}} true you are; say one word, and I {{will let you}} go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I regret <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> not in," [...] she said, by way {{of turning}} the visit from herself; [...] "but he is to be {{expected}} every moment. Are you lately from Templeton?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am no casuist, sir," [...] {{returned}} the youth; [...] "but I feel <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> entitled to <b>my</b> affection, and I would encounter greater risks {{to prove it}} to him in his old age." ...|$|R
60|$|It was grim {{news that}} old Falcone brought us. He had never quitted {{my father in}} those six weary years of {{wandering}} until now <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> beyond the need of his or any other's service.|$|E
60|$|He moved a {{few steps}} towards them, and then paused. I saw <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> leaning forward, and in his shaking hand was a tiny gleaming revolver. A certain desperate courage seemed to have come to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. I can't imagine. I {{knew when}} I {{saw in the}} papers <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> dead that she would come home. But I kept back the address. I told the solicitors, curse them, to keep it secret." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'At this rate,' said John, 'they are {{the people}} to consume nothing. There was such {{an account of the}} Barbuda {{property}} the other day, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> thinking of going to see {{what is to be done}} with it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no one, my lord, no one," [...] {{said the}} Countess, {{something}} alarmed at the tone, {{in which the}} question was put; [...] "but yet, my lord, I would fain be assured by mine own eyesight <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am the one}} to go. I {{know well}} the road from here to Williamsburg, and it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> among the troops there, in which case I shall have no trouble in getting speech with the French general." ...|$|R
