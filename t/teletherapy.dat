5|$|The accident, {{along with}} other similar events, {{prompted}} the IAEA to re-evaluate {{the effectiveness of the}} radioactive hazard trefoil as a warning symbol. Although the symbol was displayed on the <b>teletherapy</b> head, none of those handling the device were aware of its meaning, nor were there written warnings in Thai. Together with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the IAEA developed a new symbol that would serve as an intuitive warning for large sources of ionizing radiation. The new symbol was published in 2007 as ISO 21482, and is intended to accompany the trefoil on internal components of devices containing dangerous sources to prevent persons from unknowingly disassembling them.|$|E
25|$|Lost source accidents, also {{referred}} to as orphan sources, are incidents in which a radioactive source is lost, stolen or abandoned. The source then might cause harm to humans. One case occurred at Yanango where a radiography source was lost, also at Samut Prakarn a phosphorus <b>teletherapy</b> source was lost and at Gilan in Iran a radiography source harmed a welder. The best known example of this type of event is the Goiânia accident in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|Caesium {{chloride}} {{composed of}} radioisotopes such as 137CsCl and 131CsCl, {{is used in}} nuclear medicine, including treatment of cancer (brachytherapy) and diagnosis of myocardial infarction. In the production of radioactive sources, it is normal to choose a chemical form of the radioisotope which would not be readily dispersed in the environment {{in the event of}} an accident. For instance, radiothermal generators (RTGs) often use strontium titanate, which is insoluble in water. For <b>teletherapy</b> sources, however, the radioactive density (Ci in a given volume) needs to be very high, which is not possible with known insoluble caesium compounds. A thimble-shaped container of radioactive caesium chloride provides the active source.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{the three}} main {{divisions}} of radiation therapy are external beam radiation therapy (EBRT or XRT) or <b>teletherapy,</b> brachytherapy or sealed source radiation therapy, and systemic radioisotope therapy or unsealed source radiotherapy. The differences relate {{to the position of}} the radiation source; external is outside the body, brachytherapy uses sealed radioactive sources placed precisely in the area under treatment, and systemic radioisotopes are given by infusion or oral ingestion. Brachytherapy can use temporary or permanent placement of radioactive sources. The temporary sources are usually placed by a technique called afterloading. In afterloading a hollow tube or applicator is placed surgically in the organ to be treated, and the sources are loaded into the applicator after the applicator is implanted. This minimizes radiation exposure to health care personnel. Particle therapy is a special case of external beam radiation therapy where the particles are protons or heavier ions. Intraoperative radiation therapy or IORT is a special type of radiation therapy that is delivered immediately after surgical removal of the cancer. This method has been employed in breast cancer (TARGeted Introperative radiation therapy or TARGIT), brain tumors and rectal cancers.|$|E
500|$|Cobalt-60 (60Co) is a {{synthetic}} radioactive isotope of cobalt, with a half-life of 5.27 years, and emits highly penetrating gamma rays.

[...] Cobalt therapy, <b>teletherapy</b> machines using megavolt gamma rays emitted by cobalt-60, a radioisotope produced by irradiating ordinary cobalt metal in a reactor, revolutionized the field between the 1950s and the early 1980s. [...] Cobalt machines were relatively cheap, robust and simple to use, although due to its 5.27 year half-life the cobalt had to be replaced about every 5 years.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to World War 2, {{the only}} {{practical}} sources of radiation for radiotherapy were radium and its [...] "emanation", radon gas, and the x-ray tube. [...] External beam radiotherapy (<b>teletherapy)</b> {{began at the}} turn of the century with relatively low voltage (<150nbsp&kV) x-ray machines. [...] It was found that while superficial tumors could be treated with low voltage x-rays, more penetrating, higher energy beams were required to reach tumors inside the body, requiring higher voltages. [...] Orthovoltage X-rays, which used tube voltages of 200-500nbsp&kV, began to be used during the 1920s. [...] To reach the most deeply buried tumors without exposing intervening skin and tissue to dangerous radiation doses required rays with energies of 1nbsp&MV or above, called [...] "megavolt" [...] radiation. [...] Producing megavolt x-rays required voltages on the x-ray tube of 3 to 5 million volts, which required huge expensive installations. [...] Megavoltage x-ray units were first built in the late 1930s but because of cost were limited to a few institutions. [...] One of the first, installed at St. Bartholomew's hospital, London in 1937 and used until 1960, used a 30 foot long x-ray tube and weighed 10 tons. [...] Radium produced megavolt gamma rays, but was extremely rare and expensive due to its low occurrence in ores. [...] In 1937 the entire world supply of radium for radiotherapy was 50 grams, valued at £800,000, or $50 million in 2005 dollars.|$|E

50|$|The Instituto Goiano de Radioterapia (IGR), {{a private}} {{radiotherapy}} institute in Goiânia, was just 1 km northwest of Praça Cívica, the administrative {{center of the}} city.

The fate of the abandoned site was disputed in court between IGR and the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, then owner of the premises. On September 11, 1986, the Court of Goiás stated it had knowledge of the abandoned radioactive material in the building.|$|E
50|$|External beam {{radiotherapy}} (EBRT) or <b>teletherapy</b> is {{the most}} common form of radiotherapy (radiation therapy). The patient sits or lies on a couch and an external source of ionizing radiation is pointed at a particular part of the body. In contrast to brachytherapy (sealed source radiotherapy) and unsealed source radiotherapy, in which the radiation source is inside the body, external beam radiotherapy directs the radiation at the tumour from outside the body. Orthovoltage ("superficial") X-rays are used for treating skin cancer and superficial structures. Megavoltage ("deep") X-rays are used to treat deep-seated tumours (e.g. bladder, bowel, prostate, lung, or brain).|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to their uses in radiography, both cobalt-60 (Co-60) and iridium-192 (Ir-192) {{are used in the}} radiotherapy of cancer. Cobalt-60 tends to be used in <b>teletherapy</b> units as a higher photon energy alternative to Cs-137, while iridium-192 tends to be used in a different mode of therapy, internal radiotherapy or brachytherapy. The iridium wires for brachytherapy are a palladium-coated iridium/palladium alloy wire made radioactive by neutron activation. This wire is then inserted into a tumor such as a breast tumor, and the tumor is irradiated by gamma ray photons from the wire. At the end of the treatment the wire is removed.|$|E

The symbol is {{to be placed on}} the device housing the source, as a warning not to dismantle the device or to get any closer. It will not be visible under normal use, only if someone attempts to disassemble the device. The symbol will not be located on building access doors, transportation packages or containers.|$|E
5000|$|Cobalt {{therapy or}} cobalt-60 therapy is the medical use of gamma rays from the {{radioisotope}} cobalt-60 to treat {{conditions such as}} cancer. Beginning in the 1950s cobalt-60 was widely used in external beam radiotherapy (<b>teletherapy)</b> machines, which produced a beam of gamma rays which was directed into the patient's body to kill tumor tissue. Because these [...] "cobalt machines" [...] were expensive and required specialist support, they were often housed in cobalt units. Cobalt therapy was a revolutionary advance in radiotherapy in the post-World War II period but is now being replaced by other technologies such as linear accelerators.|$|E
5000|$|Orthovoltage X-rays are {{sometimes}} termed [...] "deep" [...] x-rays (DXR). The energy and penetrating {{ability of the}} x-rays produced by an x-ray tube increases with the voltage on the tube. External beam radiotherapy (<b>teletherapy)</b> began {{around the turn of}} the 20th century with ordinary diagnostic x-ray tubes, which used voltages below 150 kV. Physicians found that these were adequate for treating superficial tumors, but not tumors inside the body. Since these low energy x-rays were mostly absorbed in the first few centimeters of tissue, to deliver a large enough radiation dose to buried tumors would cause severe skin burns.|$|E
