25|$|Hamlet {{struggles to}} turn his desire for revenge into action, and spends {{a large portion of}} the play waiting rather <b>than</b> <b>doing.</b> Scholars have {{proposed}} numerous theories as to why he waits so long to kill Claudius. Some say that Hamlet feels for his victim, fearing to strike because he believes that if he kills Claudius he will be no better than him. The story of Pyrrhus, told by one of the acting troupe, for example, shows Hamlet the darker side of revenge, something he does not wish for. Hamlet frequently admires those who are swift to act, such as Laertes, who comes to avenge his father's death, but at the same time fears them for their passion, intensity, and lack of logical thought.|$|E

25|$|Explicit {{extrinsic}} {{rewards and}} punishments {{have been found}} to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards. This may be because such extrinsic, top-down incentives may replace (partially or in whole) intrinsic and reputational incentives, motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards, which overall may make the behaviors less desirable. Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them. This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists, especially by those who are non-cooperators. A counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better <b>than</b> <b>doing</b> no good at all.|$|E

The fanfare and expectation the club placed on him for his debut has led to long-term criticism of the club about how they mismanaged his first match; five years after his debut, Paul Roos said he was appalled at how the club handled him for his debut. His first touch of the football saw him [...] "gang tackled" [...] by three Collingwood players, with some suggesting the tackle [...] "ruined him"; teammate on the day, Russell Robertson, dispelled these thoughts and said the team did not do enough to protect him, with the Collingwood captain at the time, Nick Maxwell, admitting in 2016 that the hype surrounding Watts did lead them to purposely be rougher with him than a standard player to ensure they limited his impact. Despite then-senior coach, Dean Bailey, claiming he was ready to play and keeping him in the team for three weeks, the football industry disagreed and scrutinised the club for using him as a marketing tool to provide a sense of hope for fans rather <b>than</b> <b>doing</b> what was best for Watts' development.|$|E

[...] Watson himself is also portrayed in a physically unflattering way, with his stomach too fat to be entirely covered by his shirt.

This is particularly reflected through the fictional interview with Larry King, who calls Watson [...] "an unorganized, incompetent media whore who thought lying to everyone was OK as long as it served his cause". The fact that Whale Wars gets better ratings after Stan takes over and employs more violent tactics is a satire of the tendency in Whale Wars, and television in general, to exploit violence for money and viewership.|$|E
