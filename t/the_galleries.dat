5|$|Scott removed <b>the</b> <b>galleries,</b> the high-sided 1606 pews, and the three-tiered pulpit. The {{tower was}} strengthened, the building's {{exterior}} facing of flint and limestone was restored, and the chancel, {{which had been}} remodelled in the late 17thcentury, was restored to its original shape and given a new east window in the Decorated Gothic style, containing Ward and Hughes glass depicting Faith, Hope and Charity, donated by the Duke of Bedford. New wooden pews were installed together with a Gothic style pulpit, and a font of Mansfield Woodhouse stone donated by the Lowndes family.|$|E
5|$|The African art and Sackler {{buildings}} were built as twin pavilions, each one story above ground and with similar display space: five galleries each, {{and only one}} with natural light. They are differentiated by their roof adornments: domes on the African art building and pyramids on the Sackler. The African art pavilion was built in red granite and uses the circle shape as its architectural theme, with round windows, rounded entrance staircase, and six, round domes on its roof. Inside, a limestone foyer overlooks the gardens and a curving stair hall leads visitors down curving stairs to <b>the</b> <b>galleries.</b> <b>The</b> <b>galleries</b> are large and customized by exhibition designers into smaller rooms to better suit small objects. The buildings are visible from Independence Avenue, and the new Enid A. Haupt Garden runs {{between them and the}} Smithsonian Institution Building. Underground, the museum and offices occupy the first two levels, and a third level hosts exhibition and educational rooms. Its levels are connected by a three-story enclosed arcade with large skylights set into the gardens above, through several feet of dirt. The pavilion was renovated in the early 2000s with a major donation from Eastman Kodak.|$|E

5|$|The organ was modernised and {{enlarged}} in the 1870s by William Davidson. After {{a number}} of moves around <b>the</b> <b>galleries,</b> it was placed in what had been intended as the south porch. At the time the church's interior was reconstructed {{at the turn of}} the 20th century, it was positioned on either side of the chancel platform at the eastern end where it remains. Organ specialists Hill, Norman & Beard (Aust) Pty Ltd gave the organ a major refurbishment and reconstruction between 1970 and 1971 at a cost of $35,000.|$|E
5|$|After architects Mario Bellini and Rudy Ricciotti had won an {{international}} competition to create its new galleries for Islamic art, the new 3,000 sq m pavilion eventually opened in 2012, consisting of ground- and lower-ground-level interior spaces {{topped by a}} golden, undulating roof (fashioned from almost 9,000 steel tubes that form an interior web) that seems to float within the neo-Classical Visconti Courtyard {{in the middle of}} the Louvre's south wing. <b>The</b> <b>galleries,</b> which the museum had initially hoped to open by 2009, represent the first major architectural intervention at the Louvre since the addition of I.M.

5|$|The Allied {{air forces}} carried out several bombing raids on Mimoyecques between November 1943 and June 1944 but caused little damage. The bombing {{disrupted}} the construction {{project and the}} initial raids of 5 and 8 November 1943 caused work to be delayed for about a month. The Germans subsequently decided to abandon the western site, where work had not progressed very far, and concentrated on the eastern site. On 6 July 1944 the Royal Air Force began bombing the site with ground-penetrating Tallboy bombs. One Tallboy hit the concrete slab on top of Drift IV, collapsing the drift. Three others penetrated the tunnels below and substantially damaged the facility, causing several of <b>the</b> <b>galleries</b> to collapse in places.|$|E
5|$|The Historic Chapels Trust {{obtained}} {{an estimate}} for the restoration, which amounted to £2.5m. Unable {{to meet the}} full amount, the Trust decided to undertake the restoration in phases. The first phase was completed in September 2007 {{at a cost of}} nearly £900,000, which included weatherproofing and major works to the roof. Of the money raised for this, £262,500 came from the Heritage Lottery Fund, £200,000 from English Heritage, £250,000 from Stoke-on-Trent City Council, and a further £20,000 was raised locally. The second phase of restoration commenced in August 2010 and was completed a year later. The Trust spent £600,000 restoring <b>the</b> <b>galleries,</b> staircases and pulpits, replacing the organ and renovating the exterior ironwork. Funds are currently being raised for the final phase of restoration, which will include installation of a new heating and lighting system.|$|E
5|$|The archaic is {{demonstrated}} by jewellery and pieces such as the limestone Lady of Auxerre, from 640 BC; and the cylindrical Hera of Samos, circa 570–560BC. After the 4thcenturyBC, focus on the human form increased, exemplified by the Borghese Gladiator. The Louvre holds masterpieces from the Hellenistic era, including The Winged Victory of Samothrace (190BC) and the Venus de Milo, symbolic of classical art. The long Galerie Campana displays an outstanding {{collection of more than}} one thousand Greek potteries. In <b>the</b> <b>galleries</b> paralleling the Seine, much of the museum's Roman sculpture is displayed. The Roman portraiture is representative of that genre; examples include the portraits of Agrippa and Annius Verus; among the bronzes is the Greek Apollo of Piombino.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the artists}} who showed in these galleries, which are often {{referred}} to as the 10th Street Co-ops or the 10th Street Scene, have since become well known. Other artists who showed in these galleries are still under known, but in many cases have continued to work with zeal and dedication whether or not they are now famous. Some of <b>the</b> most well-known <b>galleries</b> that made <b>the</b> area what it was were: <b>the</b> Tanager <b>Gallery,</b> <b>The</b> March <b>Gallery,</b> <b>The</b> Hansa <b>Gallery,</b> <b>The</b> Brata <b>Gallery,</b> <b>The</b> James <b>Gallery,</b> <b>The</b> Phoenix <b>Gallery,</b> <b>The</b> Camino <b>Gallery,</b> and <b>the</b> Area <b>Gallery.</b> Although <b>the</b> 10th Street <b>galleries</b> have almost all closed <b>The</b> Phoenix <b>Gallery</b> remains albeit in a new location and with a new membership.|$|R
50|$|At {{the moment}} of its being purchased, <b>the</b> <b>gallery</b> had a rich history but was in a poor condition. The new owner of <b>the</b> <b>gallery</b> {{restored}} <b>the</b> building and performed a full rebranding of <b>the</b> <b>gallery.</b> <b>The</b> institution started hosting regular expositions, participating in international projects, organizing annual plein-air events and publishing artists' catalogues. Fine arts (painting, sculpture, graphics) have become {{the main focus of}} <b>the</b> <b>gallery.</b> It was <b>the</b> first time that cutting-edge business technologies were used in <b>the</b> <b>gallery</b> activity of <b>the</b> capital.

5|$|The {{courtyard}} was rebuilt, {{the architect}} Dominique Gallo designing two arcades, stretching between points H and C. The arcades, fronting the earlier wing by Lucien I, each have twelve arches, decorated by white marble balustrading {{on the upper}} level. Today the upper arcades are known as the Galerie d'Hercule (gallery of Hercules) because their ceilings were painted with scenes depicting the Labours of Hercules by Orazio de Ferrari during the later reign of Honoré II. These arcades or loggias provide corridors to the state rooms in the south wing (today known as the State Rooms Wings). On {{the other side of}} the courtyard a new wing was constructed and the Genoese artist Luca Cambiasi was charged with painting its external walls with frescoes. It is thought that <b>the</b> <b>galleries</b> (B) to the north wing overlooking the harbour were built at this time.|$|E
5|$|Around 1670, {{the church}} was refurbished, a gallery was built at {{the western end of}} the nave, and the carved reredos and a large wooden Royal coat of arms, now at the west end of the nave, were {{acquired}} at the same time. An inspection report {{at the end of the}} 18th century commented on the dirty transept walls, and the need to install the equivalent of a cattle grid to keep pigs out of the churchyard. Rich crimson hangings in the church had earlier attracted the attention of a thief. The increasing congregation led to the replacement of the pews and the construction of galleries down both sides of the building in 1829, but a more extensive rebuilding was undertaken in 1878–80, by James Piers St Aubyn. <b>The</b> <b>galleries</b> were removed and the two outer aisles were added during this period, a chapel was converted to a vestry and improvements were made to the Hastings Chapel. The cost of these works has been estimated as between £16,000 and more than £18,000. Later developments included the expenditure of £13,000 between 1963 and 1968 to combat deathwatch beetles found during rewiring, improvements to the heating system, and a rededication in 1974, the quincentenary of the church.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with the rich ornamentation of the main building, <b>the</b> <b>galleries</b> in the Sainsbury Wing are pared-down and intimate, to suit the smaller scale {{of many of the}} paintings. The main inspirations for these rooms are Sir John Soane's toplit galleries for the Dulwich Picture Gallery and the church interiors of Filippo Brunelleschi (the stone dressing is in pietra serena, the grey stone local to Florence). The northernmost galleries align with Barry's central axis, so that there is a single vista down the whole length of the Gallery. This axis is exaggerated by the use of false perspective, as the columns flanking each opening gradually diminish in size until the visitor reaches the focal point (as of 2009), an altarpiece by Cima of The Incredulity of St Thomas. Venturi's postmodernist approach to architecture is in full evidence at the Sainsbury Wing, with its stylistic quotations from buildings as disparate as the clubhouses on Pall Mall, the Scala Regia in the Vatican, Victorian warehouses and Ancient Egyptian temples.|$|E

5|$|Meier has {{exploited}} the two naturally-occurring ridges (which diverge at a 22.5 degree angle) by overlaying two grids along these axes. These grids serve {{to define the}} space of the campus while dividing the import of the buildings on it. Along one axis lie <b>the</b> <b>galleries</b> and along the other axis lie the administrative buildings. Meier emphasized the two competing grids by constructing strong view lines through the campus. The main north-south axis starts with the helipad, then includes a narrow walkway between the auditorium and north buildings, continues past the elevator kiosk to the tram station, through the rotunda, past the walls and support columns of the exhibitions pavilion, and finally the ramp besides the west pavilion and the central garden. Its corresponding east-west visual axis starts with the edge of the scholar's wing of the Getty Research Institute (GRI), the walkway between the central garden and the GRI, the overlook to the azalea pool in the central garden, the walkway between the central garden and the west pavilion, and finally the north wall of the west pavilion and the courtyard between the south and east pavilions.|$|E
5|$|Mistra {{was ruled}} from Constantinople after 1262, then was the suzerain of the Despotate of the Morea from 1348 to 1460. In Mistra, {{there are several}} {{basilica}} plan churches with domed galleries that create a five-domed cross-in-square over a ground-level basilica plan. The Aphentiko at Brontochion Monastery was built c. 1310–22 and the later church of the Pantanassa Monastery (1428) is of the same type. The Aphentiko may have been originally planned as a cross-in-square church, but has a blend of longitudinal and central plan components, with an interior divided into nave and aisles like a basilica. The barrel-vaulted nave and cross arms have a dome at their crossing, and the corner bays of <b>the</b> <b>galleries</b> are also domed to form a quincunx pattern. A remodeling of the Metropolis church in Mistra created an additional example. The Pantanassa incorporates Western elements in that domes in its colonnaded porch are hidden externally, and its domes have ribs of rectangular section {{similar to those of}} Salerno, Ravello, and Palermo.|$|E
5|$|The 19th century also {{witnessed}} {{two major}} restorations to St Denys'. As the congregation expanded, {{the need for}} greater space was met {{with the addition of}} a new north aisle in 1853. This coincided with a wider restoration project carried out at the cost of £3,500 by Kirk and Parry, which included the demolition of <b>the</b> <b>galleries,</b> the addition of a strainer arch and the relocation of the organ. The church was damaged by an electrical storm in 1884 and parts, including the stone broach spire—one of the oldest in England—were rebuilt by Kirk and Parry in 1885–86. The old organ was sold in 1891 and St Hugh's Chapel and the choir vestry were dedicated to the memory of a local solicitor, Henry Snow, in 1906. Electric lighting was introduced in 1951–53 and extensive restoration work was carried out in 1966, when the organ was rebuilt, and in 1988. Fifty-four solar panels were added in 2008, at the cost of £70,000, and by 2011 were able to cover the church's electricity bill.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>gallery</b> was {{severely}} damaged by flooding caused by Hurricane Sandy, with about 98% of <b>the</b> <b>gallery's</b> inventory destroyed. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Gallery</b> promptly rebuilt, and reopened 2 {{months after the}} storm with a group exhibition.|$|R

5000|$|Galerie Ror Volmar or Ror Volmar Gallery was an {{art gallery}} located at 58 Rue de Bourgogne in the 7th {{arrondissement}} of Paris, at its peak in the late 1950s and 1960s. <b>The</b> <b>gallery</b> specialized in contemporary figurative painters. In 1970, Art International reported that <b>the</b> <b>gallery</b> had been [...] "holding an exhibition of paintings unusual both in content and treatment."

5|$|The {{building}} remained substantially unchanged until {{vacated by}} the hospital in 1930. After the freehold was purchased by Lord Rothermere, the wings were demolished to leave the original central portion (with the dome now appearing disproportionately tall) and Smirke's later wings. When the museum moved into the building in 1936 {{the ground floor of}} the central portion was occupied by the principal art gallery, with the east wing housing the Naval gallery and the west wing the Army gallery. The Air Force gallery was housed in the former theatre. The first floor comprised further art galleries (including rooms dedicated to Sir William Orpen and Sir John Lavery), a gallery on women's war work, and exhibits relating to transport and signals. The first floor also housed the museum's photograph collection. The second floor housed the museum's library in its west wing, and in the east wing the map collection and stored pictures and drawings. This division of exhibits by service, and by civil or military activity, persisted until a wide-ranging redisplay of <b>the</b> <b>galleries</b> from the 1960s onwards. In September 1972 the building received Grade II listed building status.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the museum began to collect material documenting the conflict. In November 1939, during the so-called 'Phoney War', the museum appeared in the opening sequence of the GPO Film Unit production The First Days, in which children are seen playing on some of the museum's German artillery pieces captured during the First World War. With the evacuation of British forces from Dunkirk in May/June 1940, however, the British Army's shortage of equipment saw eighteen of the museum's artillery pieces return to military service. The museum's trench clubs were used by the Home Guard, while other items such as sights and optical instruments were returned to the Ministry of Supply. The museum refused, however, to return some historic items such as a naval gun from HMS Lance (which had fired Britain's first shot of the First World War) or a gun served by Victoria Cross-winning boy seaman Jack Cornwell. The museum initially remained open but was closed {{for the duration of the}} war in September 1940 with the onset of the Blitz. On 31 January 1941 the museum was struck by a Luftwaffe bomb which fell on the naval gallery. A number of ship models were damaged by the blast and a Short Seaplane, which had flown at the Battle of Jutland, was destroyed. While closed to the public the museum's building was used for a variety of purposes connected to the war effort, such as a repair garage for government motor vehicles, a centre for Air Raid Precautions civil defence lectures and a fire fighting training school. In October 1945 the museum mounted a temporary exhibition, the first since the end of the war in August, which showcased technologies developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department. These included the submarine fuel pipeline PLUTO, the fog dispersal method FIDO, and flame weapons such as the Churchill Crocodile and Wasp Universal Carrier. However, due to bomb damage to both the building and exhibits, the museum was obliged to reopen its galleries piecemeal. The museum reopened a portion of its galleries in November 1946. A third of <b>the</b> <b>galleries</b> were opened in 1948 and a further wing opened in 1949.|$|E
