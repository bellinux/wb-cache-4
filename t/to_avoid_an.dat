5|$|Aversive {{conditioning}} deters bears by modifying their behaviour. Deterrents such as noise {{makers and}} rubber bullets are used {{each time the}} bear performs an undesirable action. Advice is also given to people <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>an</b> eventual habituation of bears to human presence. If this conditioning is continual the bear will {{be less likely to}} continue the undesirable behaviour (crossing into campsites and roads etc.).|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Malaysian Marine Police boats {{entered the}} waters around Pedra Branca on several occasions. However, both Malaysia and Singapore acted with restraint, the Singapore Navy having been given strict {{instructions}} not to escalate matters. In 1989, the then Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad made an unannounced {{visit to the}} vicinity of the island. His boat was intercepted by Singapore naval vessels. <b>To</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>an</b> international incident, he directed his boat to leave.|$|E

25|$|Research by Sobh and Martin (2011) {{suggests}} that people buy anti-aging products {{to obtain a}} hoped-for self (e.g., keeping a youthful skin) or <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>a</b> feared-self (e.g., looking old). The research shows that when consumers pursue a hoped-for self, it is expectations of success that most strongly drive their motivation to use the product. The research also shows why doing badly when trying <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>a</b> feared self is more motivating than doing well. Interestingly, when product use is seen to fail it is more motivating than success when consumers seek <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>a</b> feared-self.|$|R

5|$|Karthik {{made his}} debut at the {{first-class}} level in late-2002 against Baroda, playing as a wicket-keeper and batting at No. 8, where he scored 37. He batted throughout the round-robin phase in five matches, scoring 179 runs {{at an average}} of 35.80 with a top score of 88* against Uttar Pradesh in his second match. This innings helped Tamil Nadu <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>an</b> outright defeat, hanging on for a draw with one wicket in hand. However his form tapered off after this match and he failed to pass 20 again during the season. He took 11 catches, but due to his repeated wicket-keeping errors, he was dropped for the final matches.|$|E

5|$|Lewis Cass, the {{governor}} of Michigan Territory, and Thomas McKenney, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, were hosting a treaty conference near Green Bay when they learned of the attacks. To discourage {{the spread of the}} uprising, Cass promptly invited Native Americans in the region to come to the treaty grounds to receive gifts and food; more than 2,000 people eventually arrived. McKenney warned the Ho-Chunk chiefs in attendance that the only way <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>an</b> American military invasion of their homeland was to surrender those responsible for the attacks. Other American officials met with other Native leaders, including Keokuk and Wabokieshiek, and urged them {{to stay out of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Nagato {{transferred}} to Truk in the Caroline Islands in August 1943.

On 1 February 1944, Nagato departed Truk <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>an</b> American air raid, and arrived at Palau three days later. The ship arrived on 21 February at Lingga Island, near Singapore, and she became the flagship of Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki, commander of Battleship Division 1, on 25 February until he transferred his flag to Yamato on 5 May. Nagato remained at Lingga until 11 May when she was {{transferred to}} Tawitawi on 12 May, and assigned to the 1st Mobile Fleet, under the command of Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa.|$|E

The ships arrived on 21 February at Lingga Island, near Singapore, and the ship became the flagship of Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki, commander of Battleship Division 1, on 25 February until he transferred his flag to Yamato on 5 May. Aside from a brief refit at Singapore, the ship remained at Lingga training until 11 May when she was transferred to Tawitawi on 12 May.

5|$|Over the summer, Stephen {{intensified}} the long-running siege of Wallingford Castle {{in a final}} attempt to take this major Angevin stronghold. The fall of Wallingford appeared imminent and Henry marched south {{in an attempt to}} relieve the siege, arriving with a small army and placing Stephen's besieging forces under siege themselves. Upon news of this, Stephen gathered up a large force and marched from Oxford, and the two sides confronted each other across the River Thames at Wallingford in July. By this point in the war, the barons on both sides seem to have been eager <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>an</b> open battle. As a result, instead of a battle ensuing, members of the church brokered a truce, to the annoyance of both Stephen and Henry.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can avoid}} attacks from their opponents by dodging {{to the left}} or right or by ducking, but players cannot punch while dodging or ducking, nor can they duck body blows. They can also block attacks to either the head or the body, but they cannot block strong punches; strong punches must be avoided by dodging or ducking. Depending on the situation, the player must {{strategically}} block, dodge, or duck in order <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>an</b> opponent's attack. Players can capitalize on the opponent's attacks by launching counter-punches immediately after avoiding an attack.|$|E

5|$|After fleeing Aboukir Bay, Admiral Villeneuve {{had been}} delayed in the Eastern Mediterranean by northeasterly winds, and on 17 August {{he decided to}} split his forces, sailing for Malta with his {{flagship}} Guillaume Tell and the two frigates while Captain Louis-Jean-Nicolas Lejoille on Généreux was ordered to Corfu. Before they departed, a number of men were transferred to Généreux, which was already carrying survivors from Timoléon, one of the ships destroyed in Aboukir Bay, giving Généreux a crew of 936 men. As Généreux rounded the island of Goza off the western tip of Crete (then known as Candia) on the following morning, his lookouts reported a sail to the northwest. This vessel was Leander. Learning of the strange ship to the southeast, Captain Thompson deduced {{that it must be}} one of Villeneuve's ships and immediately ordered all sails set in an effort <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>an</b> unequal combat: Généreux carried 30 more guns than Leander and was more strongly built, carrying a broadside of over 1,000lbs to Leanders 432lbs.|$|E
5|$|Battleship {{doctrine}} emphasised {{the concentration}} of the battlegroup. In order for this concentrated force {{to be able to}} bring its power to bear on a reluctant opponent (or <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>an</b> encounter with a stronger enemy fleet), battlefleets needed some means of locating enemy ships beyond horizon range. This was provided by scouting forces; at various stages battlecruisers, cruisers, destroyers, airships, submarines and aircraft were all used. (With the development of radio, direction finding and traffic analysis would come into play, as well, so even shore stations, broadly speaking, joined the battlegroup.) So for most of their history, battleships operated surrounded by squadrons of destroyers and cruisers. The North Sea campaign of the First World War illustrates how, despite this support, the threat of mine and torpedo attack, and the failure to integrate or appreciate the capabilities of new techniques, seriously inhibited the operations of the Royal Navy Grand Fleet, the greatest battleship fleet of its time.|$|E
