25|$|In July, Hulk Hogan, {{alongside}} Sting, began feuding with {{a mysterious}} group of masked men, who had dubbed themselves the Aces & Eights. The group's attack on Hulk Hogan on the July 12 episode of Impact Wrestling {{was used to}} write Hulk Hogan off the show, as he was set to undergo another back surgery. On the August 16, 2012 episode of Impact, Hogan hired Taryn Terrell, as the referee for the TNA Women's Knockout Championship match between Madison Rayne and Miss Tessmacher. In November, Hogan would move into a storyline with her father and Bully Ray after Austin Aries revealed a secret relationship between herself and Ray. After seeing them kissing in a parking garage on the December 20 episode of Impact Wrestling, Hulk suspended Ray indefinitely on the January 3, 2013, episode. The following week, after Ray saved Hogan from a kidnapping by the Aces & Eights, Hogan accepted his marriage proposal much to her father's dismay. The ceremony took place the next week on Impact Wrestling, where Ray's groomsman Tazz interrupted and revealed {{himself to be a}} member of Aces & Eights, leading to the group attacking Ray, Hulk Hogan, and the rest of the groomsmen. On the February 21 edition of Impact, after listening to Hogan plea, Hulk Hogan named Bully Ray the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship at Lockdown. At this event, Bully Ray would turn his back on Hogan and TNA by revealing himself as the President of the Aces & Eights. On the following episodes of Impact, Bully Ray touted the fact that the public bought into his deceptive act the entire time to earn the trust of Sting, Hogan, and Hulk Hogan as a way <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to capture the TNA World Title. Hogan continued to seek a divorce from her husband and got it ending the storyline. On August 16, 2013 it was reported that Hogan had been released from TNA.|$|E

500|$|By {{at least}} July 1999, Monolith {{has decided to}} {{introduce}} many major changes to the game; the main reason being that the gaming press unexpectedly started comparing the game to James Bond games, like GoldenEye 007 (1997). Hubbard mentioned that their intention was to [...] "make a 60s spy game", and that they [...] "didn't {{want to make a}} 'Bond' style game, so when people were obviously drawing that comparison, we decided to rework things a bit. We wanted {{to get away from the}} Bond comparisons that people were making, so we've changed the main character and the back-story a fair amount." [...] As a result, the player controls a female protagonist in the final game, Cate Archer, who works for an organization called UNITY. Changing the main character to a woman not only helped the separation of the game from the Bond franchise, but also allowed for [...] "more interesting dramatic possibilities", and the [...] "list of gadgets got a lot more visually interesting". As Hubbard said, before switching to a female protagonist, he had been [...] "struggling with trying to distinguish him from all the other male superspies from the era—extraordinarily handsome, intelligent, knowledgeable, resourceful, and so on. But a woman with those same characteristics immediately stood out because of the social climate of the time. No matter how qualified she might be, she'd have to overcome some serious barriers just <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to prove herself. And if things didn't go flawlessly on a mission, she'd catch more heat than she deserved." ...|$|E

So it’s not a shock to find out that, after tonight, we’re probably going to be spending some time in the Underworld next month. We already know we’re meeting Hercules and Megara; given tonight’s events, does that also mean we’re meeting Hades? The bigger (and more interesting) question at stake is the fact that now that we’re in the Underworld, how many previously dead characters are going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to return? We’ve already had confirmations of past-dead characters like Cruella and Cora, though both of those characters are supposedly strictly for the show’s 100th episode. Regardless, moving to the Underworld opens up a host of options for 5B in terms of characters and plot, and I’m curious to see what those options are." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, Anand {{was offered a}} few roles {{starring}} as the male lead opposite singer-actress Suraiya in woman-oriented films. He considered himself to be very lucky <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to star opposite such an established actress and accepted the offers. While shooting these films, they became romantically involved. The {{two of them were}} paired in seven films together: Vidya (1948), Jeet (1949), Shair (1949), Afsar (1950), Nili (1950), Do Sitare (1951) and Sanam (1951), all of which were successful at the box office. In these films, Suraiya was always first-biller in the credits, indicating that she was a bigger star than Anand. She {{fell in love with him}} during the shooting of the song Kinare kinare chale jayen ge from the film Vidya— while shooting the scene, the boat they were in capsized, and Anand saved Suraiya from drowning. Initially, Suraiya's family used to welcome Dev Anand at home, but when her maternal grandmother found out that the two were in love, and even planned an actual marriage on the set of [...] "Jeet", she started monitoring them. The two shared love letters and messages through their co-actors, like Durga Khote and Kamini Kaushal, who went out of their way to engineer secret rendezvous. During the shooting of the film 'Afsar' (1950), Anand finally proposed to Suraiya and gave her a diamond ring worth Rs 3,000. Her maternal grandmother opposed the relationship as they were Muslim and Anand was Hindu, and so, Suraiya remained unmarried. They stopped acting together after her grandmother opposed their partnership, and [...] "Do Sitare" [...] was the last film in which they appeared together. Although the films he starred in with Suraiya had been successful, the producers and directors of those films attributed their success to the acting prowess and screen presence of Suraiya. Anand began looking for an opportunity to play the main male lead in a film where his acting skills could be demonstrated, so as to dispel scepticism about his acting abilities.|$|E
