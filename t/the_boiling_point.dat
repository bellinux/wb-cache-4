40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a cryogenic Joule-Thomson refrigeration capable of pumping multicomponent gases {{with a single}} stage sorption compressor system. Alternative methods of pumping a multicomponent gas with a single stage compressor are disclosed. In a first embodiment, the sorbent geometry is such that a void is defined near {{the output of the}} sorption compressor. When the sorbent is cooled, the sorbent primarily adsorbs <b>the</b> higher <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> gas such that <b>the</b> lower <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> gas passes through the sorbent to occupy the void. When the sorbent is heated, <b>the</b> higher <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> gas is desorbed at high temperature and pressure and thereafter propels <b>the</b> lower <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> gas out of the sorption compressor. A mixing chamber is provided to remix the constituent gases prior to expansion of the gas through a Joule-Thomson valve. Other methods of pumping a multicomponent gas are disclosed. For example, where the sorbent is porous and <b>the</b> low <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> gas does not adsorb very well, the pores of the sorbent will act as a void space for <b>the</b> lower <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> gas. Alternatively, a mixed sorbent may be used where a first sorbent component physically adsorbs <b>the</b> high <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> gas and where the second sorbent component chemically absorbs <b>the</b> low <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> gas...|$|R

5|$|In 1761, Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov {{observed}} an arc {{of light}} surrounding {{the part of}} Venus off the Sun's disc {{at the beginning of}} the egress phase of the transit and concluded that Venus has an atmosphere.

5|$|Zinc oxide {{itself is}} non-toxic; {{however it is}} {{hazardous}} to inhale zinc oxide fumes, as generated when zinc or zinc alloys are melted and oxidized at high temperature.

40|$|An {{empirical}} method for estimation of <b>the</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> of organic molecules based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations with polarized continuum model (PCM) solvent corrections has been developed. <b>The</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> are calculated as {{the sum of}} three contributions.

The method is applicable to a very diverse range of organic molecules, with normal <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> in <b>the</b> range of − 50 to 500 °C, and includes ten different elements (C, H, Br, Cl, F, N, O, P, S and Si).

5|$|Strontium is a {{divalent}} silvery metal with a {{pale yellow}} tint whose properties are mostly intermediate between and {{similar to those}} of its group neighbors calcium and barium. It is softer than calcium and harder than barium. Its melting (777°C) and boiling (1655°C) points are lower than those of calcium (842°C and 1757°C respectively); barium continues this downward trend in the melting point (727°C), but not in <b>the</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> (2170°C). The density of strontium (2.64g/cm3) is similarly intermediate between those of calcium (1.54g/cm3) and barium (3.594g/cm3). Three allotropes of metallic strontium exist, with transition points at 235 and 540°C.|$|E
5|$|The melting and boiling {{points of}} {{tennessine}} are not known; earlier papers predicted about 350–500°C and 550°C, respectively, or 350–550°C and 610°C, respectively.

A later paper predicts <b>the</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of tennessine to be 345°C (that of astatine is estimated as 309°C, 337°C, or 370°C, although experimental values of 230°C and 411°C have been reported). The density of tennessine {{is expected to}} be between 7.1 and 7.3g·cm−3, continuing the trend of increasing density among the halogens; that of astatine is estimated to be between 6.2 and 6.5g·cm−3.|$|E

5|$|Each engine main {{combustion}} chamber (MCC) receives fuel-rich hot gas from a hot-gas manifold cooling circuit. The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the injector, which mixes the propellants. A small augmented-spark igniter-chamber {{is located in}} the center of the injector, and this dual-redundant igniter is used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion. The igniters are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is self-sustaining. The main injector and dome assembly are welded to the hot-gas manifold, and the MCC is also bolted to the hot-gas manifold. The MCC comprises a structural shell made of Inconel 718 which is lined with a copper-silver-zirconium alloy called NARloy-Z, developed specifically for the RS-25 in the 1970s. Around 390 channels are machined into the liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through the liner to provide MCC cooling, as the temperature in the {{combustion chamber}} reaches 3300°C (6000°F) during flight – higher than <b>the</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of iron.|$|E
5|$|Indium is a silvery-white, highly ductile post-transition metal with {{a bright}} luster. It is so soft (Mohs {{hardness}} 1.2) that like sodium, it can be cut with a knife. It also leaves a visible line on paper. It {{is a member of}} group 13 on the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between its vertical neighbours gallium and thallium. Like tin, a high-pitched cry is heard when indium is bent – a crackling sound due to crystal twinning. Like gallium, indium is able to wet glass. Like both, indium has a low melting point, 156.60°C (313.88°F); higher than its lighter homologue, gallium, but lower than its heavier homologue, thallium, and lower than tin. <b>The</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> is 2072°C (3762°F), higher than that of thallium, but lower than gallium, conversely to the general trend of melting points, but similarly to the trends down the other post-transition metal groups because of the weakness of the metallic bonding with few electrons delocalized.|$|E
5|$|Ununennium is {{predicted}} to have a melting point between 0°C and 30°C: thus {{it may be a}} liquid at room temperature. It is not known whether this continues the trend of decreasing melting points down the group, as francium's melting point is known so poorly, having been variously been stated to be around 23°C or 27°C, with both values very close to the caesium value (28.5°C), possibly due to the extreme heat generated by francium's radioactive decay. <b>The</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of ununennium is expected to be around 630°C, which is lower than that of all the previous elements in the group, following the downward periodic trend. The density of ununennium has been variously predicted to be between 3 and 4g·cm−3, continuing the trend of increasing density down the group, using the predicted value for francium between 2.8 and 3.0g·cm−3.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic ash is also {{produced}} during phreatomagmatic eruptions. During these eruptions fragmentation occurs when magma comes {{into contact with}} bodies of water (such as the sea, lakes and marshes) groundwater, snow or ice. As the magma, which is significantly hotter than <b>the</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of water, comes into contact with water an insulating vapor film forms (Leidenfrost effect). Eventually this vapor film will collapse leading to direct coupling of the cold water and hot magma. This increases the heat transfer {{which leads to the}} rapid expansion of water and fragmentation of the magma into small particles which are subsequently ejected from the volcanic vent. Fragmentation causes an increase in contact area between magma and water creating a feedback mechanism, leading to further fragmentation and production of fine ash particles.|$|E
5|$|A synthetic, {{radioactive}} element, curium is a hard, dense metal with a silvery-white {{appearance and}} {{physical and chemical}} properties resembling those of gadolinium. Its melting point of 1340°C is significantly higher than that of the previous transuranic elements neptunium (637°C), plutonium (639°C) and americium (1173°C). In comparison, gadolinium melts at 1312°C. <b>The</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of curium is 3110°C. With a density of 13.52 g/cm3, curium is significantly lighter than neptunium (20.45 g/cm3) and plutonium (19.8 g/cm3), but is heavier than most other metals. Between two crystalline forms of curium, the α-Cm is more stable at ambient conditions. It has a hexagonal symmetry, space group P63/mmc, lattice parameters a = 365 pm and c = 1182 pm, and four formula units per unit cell. The crystal consists of a double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum. At pressures above 23 GPa, at room temperature, α-Cm transforms into β-Cm, which has a face-centered cubic symmetry, space group Fmm and the lattice constant a = 493 pm. Upon further compression to 43 GPa, curium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-Cm structure similar to that of α-uranium, with no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa. These three curium phases are also referred to as Cm I, II and III.|$|E
