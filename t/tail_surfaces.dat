5|$|In spring 1941, Geschwaderstab of JG3 was {{transferred}} to Mannheim-Sandhofen {{for a period of}} rest and conversion to the new Bf109F-2. On 4 May 1941, the Geschwaderstab was sent back into combat along the Channel Coast. On 7 May 1941, Lützow's Bf109F-2 (Werknummer 8117—factory number) suffered minor damage in combat when his <b>tail</b> <b>surfaces</b> were shot up. Operating from Saint-Pol-Brias until 8 June, the Geschwaderstab flew missions over southern England and the English Channel without filing any claims or sustaining any losses.|$|E
5|$|The ellipse {{also served}} as the design basis for the Spitfire's fin and {{tailplane}} assembly, once again exploiting the shape's favourable aerodynamic characteristics. Both the elevators and rudder were shaped so that their centre of mass was shifted forward, thus reducing control-surface flutter. The longer noses and greater propeller-wash resulting from larger engines in later models necessitated increasingly larger vertical and, later, horizontal <b>tail</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{to compensate for the}} altered aerodynamics, culminating in those of the Mk 22/24 series which were 25% larger in area than those of the Mk I.|$|E
5000|$|The single {{vertical}} <b>tail</b> <b>surface</b> was of an [...] "all-flying" [...] design (with no fixed fin) and {{the entire}} <b>tail</b> <b>surface</b> structure and covering also consisted of formed sheet steel, much like the wings, however the angle of incidence of the stabilizer could be adjusted on the ground.|$|R

5|$|The XF6U {{was a small}} {{aircraft}} with tricycle {{landing gear}} and with straight wings and <b>tail</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The wings were short enough {{that they did not}} need to fold. In order to fit more aircraft into crowded hangars, the nose gear could be retracted and the aircraft's weight would rest on a small wheel attached by the ground crew. This raised the tail up so that it could overlap the nose of the aircraft behind it, allowing more aircraft to fit into available hangar space. The turbojet engine was mounted {{in the rear of the}} fuselage and was fed by ducts in each wing root.|$|E
5|$|In September 1946, {{prior to}} the {{completion}} of the DH 108s, BOAC requests necessitated a redesign of the DH 106 from its previous 24-seat configuration to a larger 36-seat version. With no time to develop the technology necessary for a proposed tailless configuration, Bishop opted for a more conventional 20-degree swept-wing design with unswept <b>tail</b> <b>surfaces,</b> married to an enlarged fuselage accommodating 36 passengers in a four-abreast arrangement with a central aisle. Replacing previously specified Halford H.1 Goblin engines, four new, more powerful Rolls-Royce Avons were to be incorporated in pairs buried in the wing roots; Halford H.2 Ghost engines were eventually applied as an interim solution while the Avons cleared certification. The redesigned aircraft was named the DH 106 Comet in December 1947. Revised first orders from BOAC and British South American Airways totalled 14 aircraft with delivery projected for 1952.|$|E
5|$|In its design, the XR-1 bore {{a strong}} {{resemblance}} to the Focke-Wulf Fw 61, a helicopter developed by Henrich Focke in Germany that, flown by Hanna Reitsch, had impressed Platt-LePage co-founder Wynn LePage during a tour of Europe. The XR-1 was powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-985 radial engine, mounted in a buried installation within the fuselage. The aircraft had two, three-bladed rotors, mounted in a side-by-side arrangement on wing-like pylons. The pylons were aerodynamically designed to produce some lift when in forwards flight, slightly unloading the rotors. The construction of the XR-1 was conventional {{by the standards of}} the time, with the aircraft's frame consisting of a steel-tube framework, which was covered with fabric. The XR-1 had <b>tail</b> <b>surfaces</b> similar to those of a conventional aircraft, and was equipped with a fixed, taildragger landing gear. The aircraft's wheels freely castered for easier maneuvering on the ground.|$|E

5|$|The JVX {{aircraft}} was designated V-22 Osprey on 15 January 1985; by that March, {{the first six}} prototypes were being produced, and Boeing Vertol was expanded {{to deal with the}} project workload. Work has been split evenly between Bell and Boeing. Bell Helicopter manufactures and integrates the wing, nacelles, rotors, drive system, <b>tail</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and aft ramp, as well as integrates the Rolls-Royce engines and performs final assembly. Boeing Helicopters manufactures and integrates the fuselage, cockpit, avionics, and flight controls. The USMC variant of the Osprey received the MV-22 designation and the U.S. Air Force variant received CV-22; this was reversed from normal procedure to prevent Marine Corps Ospreys from having a conflicting designation with aircraft carriers (CV). Full-scale development of the V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft began in 1986. On 3 May 1986, the Bell Boeing partnership was awarded a $1.714 billion contract for V-22 aircraft by the U.S. Navy. At this point, all four U.S. military services had acquisition plans for V-22 versions.|$|E
5|$|The YF-22 was {{designed}} to meet USAF requirements for survivability, supercruise, stealth, and ease of maintenance. Because Lockheed's submission was selected {{as one of the}} winners, the company, through its Skunk Works division, assumed leadership of the program partners. It would be responsible for the forward cockpit and fuselage, as well as final assembly at Palmdale, California. Meanwhile, the wings and aft fuselage would be built by Boeing, with the center fuselage, weapons bays, tail and landing gears built by General Dynamics. Compared with its Northrop/McDonnell Douglas counterpart, the YF-22 has a more conventional design – its wings have larger control surfaces, such as full-span trailing edge, and, whereas the YF-23 had two <b>tail</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the YF-22 had four, which made it more maneuverable than its counterpart. Two examples of each prototype air vehicle (PAV) were built for the Demonstration-Validation phase: one with General Electric YF120 engines, the other with Pratt & Whitney YF119 engines.|$|E
5|$|The first {{successful}} flight of Zveno-1, using a Tupolev TB-1 mothership and two Tupolev I-4 fighters mounted {{on top of}} the wings, took place on 3 December 1931. An error in the sequence of opening the latches by the bomber crew resulted in one of the fighters prematurely separating, but the TB-1 with an I-4 attached to one of the wings remained in controlled flight and the second fighter was soon uneventfully deployed. After latch control was fully moved into the fighters, the normal launch procedure consisted of pilots opening the tail lock and then pulling on the control stick to open the front locks and separate from the bomber. As predicted, the presence of docked fighters had a minimal impact on performance of the mothership, and Zveno-2 Tupolev TB-3 carrying three Polikarpov I-5 fighters handled the same as an ordinary bomber. To mount the aircraft on the wings, they were pushed up special ramps but the centerline aircraft had to be lifted {{on top of the}} fuselage by hand. This was so cumbersome that the centerline I-5 became a permanent fixture on top of the Zveno-2 TB-3 and never started in the air. At one point, the centerline I-5, still with a pilot at the controls to operate the engine, had the wings and the <b>tail</b> <b>surfaces</b> removed and was used purely as fifth powerplant for the bomber mothership.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} examine the {{effectiveness}} of the application of static magnetic field (SMF) on pain relief, we performed a study on rats with adjuvant arthritis (AA). Sixty female Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats (age: 6 weeks, body weight: approximately 160 [*]g) were divided into three groups [SMF-treated AA rats (Group I), non-SMF-treated AA rats (Group II) and control rats (Group III) ]. The SD rats were injected in the left hind leg with 0. 6 [*]mg/ 0. 05 [*]ml Mycobacterium butyrium to induce AA. The rats were bred for 6 months as chronic pain model. Thereafter, the AA rats were or were not exposed to SMF for 12 weeks. We assessed the changes in the <b>tail</b> <b>surface</b> temperature, locomotor activity, serum inflammatory marker and bone mineral density (BMD) using thermography, a metabolism measuring system and the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) method, respectively. The <b>tail</b> <b>surface</b> temperature, locomotor activity and femoral BMD of the SMF-exposed AA rats were significantly higher than those of the non-SMF-exposed AA rats, and the serum inflammatory marker was significantly lower. These findings suggest that the pain relief effects are primarily due to the increased blood circulation caused by the rise in the <b>tail</b> <b>surface</b> temperature. Moreover, the pain relief effects increased with activity and BMD of the AA rats...|$|R
50|$|The Noralpha was a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with a braced horizontal <b>tail</b> <b>surface</b> {{and single}} rudder. It had a retractable tricycle landing gear.

Four gas-control vanes operating in the motor efflux turn the missile towards the required direction of flight. After the turnover manoeuvre, {{they are no longer}} used and subsequent flight controlled via moving <b>tail</b> <b>surfaces.</b> A dual-mode solid-propellant rocket motor provides the missile with a maximum speed of Mach 4.5.|$|E
50|$|To {{avoid this}} problem the kite balloon was developed. This form has an {{elongated}} shape to reduce wind resistance and {{some form of}} <b>tail</b> <b>surface</b> to stabilise {{it so that it}} always points into the wind. Like the powered airship, such balloons are often called blimps.|$|R
2500|$|The tail is also mostly GRP, {{though the}} {{elevator}} uses carbon fibre for lightness.

50|$|The first prototype, Ju 388 L-0/V7, mainly {{built from}} Ju 188 series {{production}} components, {{made its first}} flight on December 22, 1943. It demonstrated much better handling at altitude than the Ju 88S due {{to an increase in}} <b>tail</b> <b>surface</b> area, as the streamlined-nose Ju 88S, also omitting the Bola gondola, still used the original Ju 88A vertical <b>tail</b> <b>surface</b> design. This was followed by six new prototypes. It was some time before deliveries of the production models started due to engine delivery delays. By the time the engines were widely available, it was clear that B-29 bombers were being sent to the Pacific and would not be operating over Germany anytime soon. German photo-reconnaissance efforts had practically disappeared due to the increased performance of the Allied defenses, so production mostly concentrated on the L model.|$|R
