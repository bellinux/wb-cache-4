5|$|From the {{beginning}} of Christianity through the tenth century, Christian theologians saw <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist</b> as the church's participation in Christ's sacrifice. Christ {{was believed to be}} present in <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist,</b> but there were differences over the way in which this occurred. The School of Antioch in the Eastern Roman Empire, along with Hilary of Poitiers and Ambrose in the Western Roman Empire, taught a realist, metabolic, or somatic view, where the elements of <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist</b> were believed to be changed into Christ's body and blood. The influential fourth-century Western theologian Augustine of Hippo, on the other hand, held that Christ is really present in the elements of <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist,</b> but not in a bodily manner, because his body remains in heaven. Augustine believed <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist</b> is a spiritual eating which allows Christians to become part of Christ's body. Western theologians in the three centuries following Augustine did not elaborate on the way Christ is present in <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist,</b> but emphasized the transforming power of the sacrament.|$|E
5|$|While Zwingli {{carried on}} the {{political}} work of the Swiss Reformation, he developed his theological views with his colleagues. The famous disagreement between Luther and Zwingli on the interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>eucharist</b> originated when Andreas Karlstadt, Luther's former colleague from Wittenberg, published three pamphlets on the Lord's Supper in which Karlstadt rejected {{the idea of a}} real presence in the elements. These pamphlets, published in Basel in 1524, received the approval of Oecolampadius and Zwingli. Luther rejected Karlstadt's arguments and considered Zwingli primarily to be a partisan of Karlstadt. Zwingli began to express his thoughts on <b>the</b> <b>eucharist</b> in several publications including de Eucharistia (On <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist).</b> He attacked the idea of the real presence and argued that the word is {{in the words of the}} institution—"This is my body, this is my blood"—means signifies. Hence, the words are understood as a metaphor and Zwingli claimed that there was no real presence during <b>the</b> <b>eucharist.</b> In effect, the meal was symbolic of the Last Supper.|$|E
5|$|According {{to church}} doctrine, the sacraments {{of the church}} require the proper form, matter, and intent to be validly {{celebrate}}d. In addition, the Canon Laws for both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches govern who may licitly celebrate certain sacraments, as well as strict rules about who may receive the sacraments. Notably, because the Church teaches that Christ is present in <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist,</b> those who are conscious {{of being in a}} state of mortal sin are forbidden to receive the sacrament until they have received absolution through the sacrament of Reconciliation (Penance). Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating {{for at least an hour}} before receiving the sacrament. Non-Catholics such are ordinarily prohibited from receiving <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist</b> as well.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1549, Vermigli became {{involved}} in controversy regarding <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist.</b> He published his disputation with Catholics at Oxford University along with a tract on the subject. He later wrote treatises on <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist</b> against Catholics as well as Lutherans. After Vermigli's death, Robert Masson collected the doctrinal passages scattered throughout these commentaries into a systematic theology called the Loci Communes, which became Vermigli's most well-known work. Several of Vermigli's letters and shorter treatises were also published during and after his life. Beginning in 1994, scholars began translating his works into modern English in a series called the Peter Martyr Library.|$|E
5|$|It is disputed {{whether the}} regular use {{of wine in}} the celebration of <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist</b> and in daily life were the {{virtually}} universal and undisputed practice in Christianity for over 1,800 years.|$|E
5|$|Reformed confessions {{reject the}} Catholic {{doctrine}} that <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist</b> is a sacrifice of propitiation, or sacrifice to satisfy God's wrath and attain forgiveness of sins. Instead, they teach that Christ's body {{is only to}} be received, not re-presented to God as a sacrifice. The confessions do sometimes speak of the Supper as a sacrifice of thanksgiving for the gift of propitiation which has been received. In the twentieth century, Scottish Reformed theologian T. F. Torrance developed a strong doctrine of Eucharistic sacrifice. He argued that Christ's person and work could not be separated, and that <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist</b> mediated his sacrificial death.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} N. J. Higham sees {{political factors}} {{at work in}} the expulsion of Mellitus, as it was Sæberht's sons who banished Mellitus. Bede said that the sons had never been converted, and after Æthelberht's death they attempted to force Mellitus to give them <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist</b> without ever becoming Christians, seeing <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist</b> as magical. Although Bede does not give details of any political factors surrounding the event, it is likely that by expelling Mellitus the sons were demonstrating their independence from Kent, and repudiating the overlordship that Æthelberht had exercised over the East Saxons. There is no evidence that Christians among the East Saxons were mistreated or oppressed after Mellitus' departure.|$|E
5|$|The liturgy of {{the sacrament}} of <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist,</b> called the Mass in the West and Divine Liturgy or other names in the East, is the {{principal}} liturgy of the Catholic Church. This is because it is considered the propitiatory sacrifice of Christ himself. The most widely used is the Roman Rite, usually in its ordinary form promulgated by Paul VI in 1969, but also in its authorised extraordinary form, the Tridentine Mass as in the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal. Eastern Catholic Churches have their own rites. The liturgies of <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist</b> and the other sacraments vary from rite to rite based on differing theological emphasis.|$|E
5|$|All clergy, whether deacons, priests or bishops, may preach, teach, baptise, witness {{marriages and}} conduct funeral liturgies. Only bishops and priests can {{administer}} the sacraments of <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist,</b> Reconciliation (Penance) and Anointing of the Sick. Only bishops can administer {{the sacrament of}} Holy Orders, which ordains someone into the clergy.|$|E

5|$|He {{developed}} the symbolic view of <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist.</b> He denied the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and following Cornelius Henrici Hoen, he {{agreed that the}} bread and wine of the institution signify and do not literally become the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Zwingli's differences of opinion on this with Martin Luther resulted in {{the failure of the}} Marburg Colloquy to bring unity between the two Protestant leaders.|$|E
5|$|On {{arriving}} in Oxford, Vermigli began lecturing on 1 Corinthians, denouncing Catholic doctrines of purgatory, clerical celibacy, and lenten fasting. He then spoke against the Catholic doctrine of <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist,</b> {{the most sensitive}} area of disagreement between Protestants and Catholics in England at the time. Conservative faculty, led by Smyth, challenged Vermigli to defend his views in a formal disputation. Smyth fled to St Andrews and finally to Leuven before the disputation could be held, so three Catholic divines, William Tresham, William Chedsey and Morgan Phillips, stepped forward to take his place. The disputation was held in 1549 before Richard Cox, the University Chancellor and a firm Protestant. It focused on the doctrine of transubstantiation, with Vermigli's opponents arguing for it and him against. Chancellor Cox made it obvious that he considered Vermigli to have the better argument, but did not formally declare a winner. The disputation put Vermigli {{at the forefront of}} debates over the nature of <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist.</b>|$|E

5|$|Vermigli {{arrived in}} Strasbourg in October 1553, {{where he was}} {{restored}} to his position at the Senior School and began lecturing on Judges as well as Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. Vermigli often gathered with other Marian exiles for study and prayer in his home. His lectures on Judges often addressed the political issues relevant for the exiles, such {{as the right to}} resist a tyrant. Since Vermigli's departure and the death of Bucer in 1551, Lutheranism had gained influence in Strasbourg under the leadership of Johann Marbach. Vermigli had been asked to sign both the Augsburg Confession and the Wittenberg Concord as a condition of being reinstalled as professor. He was willing to sign the Augsburg Confession, but not the Concordat, which affirmed a bodily presence of Christ in <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist.</b> He was retained and reappointed anyway, but controversy over <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist</b> as well as Vermigli's strong doctrine of double predestination continued with the Lutherans. Another professor in Strasbourg, Girolamo Zanchi, who had converted to Protestantism while under Vermigli in Lucca, shared Vermigli's convictions regarding <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist</b> and predestination. Zanchi and Vermigli became friends and allies. Vermigli's increasing alienation from the Lutheran establishment led him in 1556 to accept an offer from Heinrich Bullinger to teach at the Carolinum school in Zürich. John Jewel, a fellow Marian exile, came along with him.|$|E

Zerchi soon dies, having witnessed an apparent miracle.|$|E
