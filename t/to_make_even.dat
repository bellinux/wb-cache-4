While watching TV, Homer sees an advertisement that suggests he attend Lanley's institute of monorail conducting, which is a transparent effort <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>even</b> more money from the con. Homer immediately decides to enroll. After a three-week course, Lanley selects Homer at random from among his classmates to be the monorail conductor.|$|E
25|$|Drummer Mason was {{replaced}} by Mike Clark, and the band released a second album, Thrust, the following year, 1974. (A live album from a Japan performance, consisting of compositions from those first two Head Hunters releases was released in 1975 as Flood.) This was almost as well received as its predecessor, if not attaining {{the same level of}} commercial success. The Headhunters made another successful album called Survival of the Fittest in 1975 without Hancock, while Hancock himself started <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>even</b> more commercial albums, often featuring members of the band, but no longer billed as The Headhunters. The Headhunters reunited with Hancock in 1998 for Return of the Headhunters, and a version of the band (featuring Jackson and Clark) continues to play and record.|$|E

25|$|As Part Two begins, it {{is assumed}} that the literate classes of Spain have all read {{the first part of the}} story. Cervantes's meta-fictional device was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>even</b> the {{characters}} in the story familiar with the publication of Part One, as well as with an actually published, fraudulent Part Two. When strangers encounter the duo in person, they already know their famous history. A Duke and Duchess, and others, deceive Don Quixote for entertainment, setting forth a string of imagined adventures resulting in a series of practical jokes. Some of them put Don Quixote's sense of chivalry and his devotion to Dulcinea through many tests. Pressed into finding Dulcinea, Sancho brings back three ragged peasant girls and tells Don Quixote that they are Dulcinea and her ladies-in-waiting. When Don Quixote only sees the peasant girls, Sancho pretends (reversing some incidents of Part One) that their derelict appearance results from an enchantment.|$|E
500|$|Joseph Bertin {{wrote in}} his 1735 {{textbook}} The Noble Game of Chess, [...] "He that plays first, is understood to have the attack." [...] This {{is consistent with the}} traditional view that White, by virtue of the first move, begins with the initiative and should try to extend it into the middlegame, while Black should strive to neutralize White's initiative and attain equality. Because White begins with the initiative, a minor mistake by White generally leads only to loss of the initiative, while a similar mistake by Black may have more serious consequences. Thus, Sveshnikov wrote in 1994, [...] "Black players cannot afford <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>even</b> the slightest mistake ... from a theoretical point of view, the tasks of White and Black in chess are different: White has to strive for a win, Blackâ€”for a draw!" ...|$|E
500|$|Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} [...] "One More Chance" [...] {{is just one}} of the [...] "consumer enticements that just add to the allure."

He explained, [...] "this David Foster song is quite demanding vocally, requiring a wider range and more power than anything else on the album. Yet Madonna more than lives up to the challenge, showing enough power and polish <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>even</b> Madonna-phobes admit she can sing. Louis Virtel from music website Idolator wrote, [...] "No other Madonna song sounds quite like it, and it holds up as a melancholic statement against grander compositions like 'You'll See' and 'I'll Remember'." ...|$|E

500|$|Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also lauded {{the three}} {{principal}} actors' achievements, especially Radcliffe: [...] "One of {{the joys of}} this film is watching Daniel Radcliffe grow so impressively {{into the role of}} Harry. He digs deep into the character and into Harry's nightmares. It's a sensational performance, touching all the bases from tender to fearful". Rolling Stones review also classified the film as better than the previous four instalments in the series, by losing the [...] "candy-ass aspect" [...] of the first two and [...] "raising the bar" [...] from the [...] "heat and resonance" [...] of the third and fourth. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called the film [...] "the best of the series so far, [...] the laughs, the jitters and the juice <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>even</b> nonbelievers wild about Harry".|$|E
500|$|The Sunday Mirror critic {{observed}} that The Man with the Golden Gun [...] "isn't the best Bond ever" [...] but found it [...] "remarkable that Messrs. Saltzman and Broccoli can still produce such slick and inventive entertainment". Arthur Thirkwell, {{writing in the}} Sunday Mirrors sister paper, the Daily Mirror concentrated more on lead actor Roger Moore than the film itself: [...] "What Sean Connery used to achieve {{with a touch of}} sardonic sadism, Roger Moore conveys with roguish schoolboy charm and the odd, dry quip." [...] Thirkwell also said that Moore [...] "manages <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>even</b> this reduced-voltage Bond a character with plenty of sparkle." [...] Judith Crist of New York Magazine gave a positive review, saying [...] "the scenery's grand, the lines nice and the gadgetry entertaining", also describing the production as a film that [...] "capture the free-wheeling, whooshing non-sense of early Fleming's fairy tale for grown-ups orientation".|$|E
500|$|After all {{text was}} written, the {{development}} team decided which scenes should have illustrations made for them; Takumi drew rough sketches of these. He also drew the storyboards for the episodes' openings. While episode openings in previous Ace Attorney games consisted of series of illustrations, the development team {{decided to change}} {{to make use of}} a [...] "more animated and dramatic presentation" [...] in Trials and Tribulations: by using moving graphics on top of still images, they were still able to limit the amount of data used. The first opening they did was for episode 2; it used animation a lot, and was liked by the development team, inspiring Takumi <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>even</b> better openings {{for the rest of the}} episodes and leading the team to think of movie effects that could be used. For one opening, they gave it a [...] "vintage movie feel": by setting the color palette to monochrome, they were able to limit the color data ...|$|E

500|$|Also {{in early}} 1996, Nu Millennia Media {{released}} Self Portrait, which included five of Walker's songs in an interactive CD-ROM format and 30 minutes of video footage. He then released his fourth album, 1997's Rumor Has It, which he co-produced with Stroud. Its title track, the first single, became his sixth and final No. 1 single that year. Other singles from the album included the number 18 [...] "One, Two, I Love You" [...] and the Top 5 hits [...] "Watch This" [...] and [...] "Then What?" [...] at number 4 and number 2, respectively. The latter also reached number 65 on the Hot 100, making {{for his first}} entry on that chart since [...] "What's It to You." [...] As with his three previous studio albums, Rumor Has It was certified platinum. Larry Stephens of Country Standard Time gave this album a mostly-negative review, calling the songs [...] "cookie-cutter" [...] outside [...] "I Need a Margarita". Thom Owens of Allmusic also {{thought that it was}} formulaic, but said that Walker was [...] "able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>even</b> mediocre material sound good", rating it three stars out of five.|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer's {{subsequent}} {{career choices}} {{have met with}} varying degrees of success. After The Age of Innocence, she played the role of Laura Alden opposite Jack Nicholson in Wolf (1994), a horror film that garnered a mixed critical reception. The New York Times wrote: [...] "Ms. Pfeiffer's role is underwritten, but her performance is expert enough <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>even</b> diffidence compelling". The movie grossed US$65million (equivalent to $million) at the domestic box office and US$131million worldwide (equivalent to $million). Her next role was that of high school teacher and former US Marine LouAnne Johnson in the surprise box office hit Dangerous Minds (1995), which was co-produced under Pfeiffer's film production company Via Rosa Productions. She appeared as her character in the music video for the soundtrack's lead single, 'Gangsta's Paradise' by Coolio (featuring L.V.), which was used by the producer Jerry Bruckheimer for television advertising. A 60-second version was aired on music channels, while a 30-second cut was aired {{in the rest of the}} networks. The song won the 1996 Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance, and the video won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Rap Video.|$|E
500|$|Steve Harris {{reviewed}} {{the game in}} Electronic Gaming Monthly in November 1989. He said that Blazing Lazers was the next best game to the much-anticipated port of R-Type. He noted the great gameplay and spectacular graphics, sound, and music. He appreciated the amount of detail in the game's graphics. He said that the large bosses in the game were the best part, saying that they [...] "were enough <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>even</b> die-hard veterans of video game wars cringe in terror". His only criticism of the game was its difficulty, especially in the game's final level; {{he says that the}} final level is near-impossible if players have lost all their power-ups. The game would be featured in a series of cheats in the magazine's January 1990 issue. It was reviewed again in the magazine's December 1989 issue by Harris and three other reviewers. In the review, Harris added that the game takes advantage of the TurboGrafx-16's processors with its animation and gameplay. Ed Semrad appreciated the detailed backgrounds, difficulty, and action, but he criticized the game for being repetitive. Donn Nauert called Blazing Lazers the best game on the console, while Martin Alessi called it the best shoot 'em up on any console; Alessi added that the gameplay, graphics, and sound are [...] "near perfect".|$|E

500|$|The video {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} media outlets. James Montgomery from MTV News {{commented that the}} video is [...] "grisly and garish, but also incredibly clever and visually arresting". T. Kyle writing for MTV Buzzworthy gave the video a positive feedback, writing [...] "Christina manages to be fun and provocative, the styling is beautiful and even aspirational, and Legendtina's body looks amazing". Sam Lansky from Idolator website complimented Aguilera's [...] "charming sense of humor" [...] and deemed [...] "Your Body" [...] as one of Aguilera's best music videos. Writing for Billboard, Jason Lipshut noted the video seemed to be inspired by the unending stream of violence on TV, but felt that Aguilera's clothing style in the video was the standout part. In {{a review of the}} video for Yahoo! Music, Lyndsey Park complimented the cultural references in the video, writing that [...] "it's enough <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>even</b> Seth MacFarlane or Dennis Miller's heads spin. And yet, somehow, it's all so very, very Xtina". Marc Hogan of Spin wrote that [...] "It might take us a few more viewings to get the joke, but at least there's enough amazing absurdity going on to make that prospect sound entertaining".

500|$|A. O. Scott of At The Movies also {{compared}} his {{viewing of}} the film to {{the first time he}} viewed Star Wars and he said [...] "although the script is a little bit... obvious," [...] it was [...] "part of what made it work". Todd McCarthy of Variety praised the film, saying [...] "The King of the World sets his sights on creating another world entirely in Avatar, and it's very much a place worth visiting." [...] Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review. [...] "The screen is alive with more action and the soundtrack pops with more robust music than any dozen sci-fi shoot-'em-ups you care to mention," [...] he stated. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded Avatar a three-and-a-half out of four star rating and wrote in his print review [...] "It extends the possibilities of what movies can do. Cameron's talent may just be as big as his dreams." [...] Richard Corliss of Time magazine thought that the film was [...] "the most vivid and convincing creation of a fantasy world ever seen in the history of moving pictures." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times thought the film has [...] "powerful" [...] visual accomplishments but [...] "flat dialogue" [...] and [...] "obvious characterization". James Berardinelli of ReelViews praised the film and its story, giving it four out of four stars; he wrote [...] "In 3-D, it's immersiveâ€“ but the traditional film elementsâ€“ story, character, editing, theme, emotional resonance, etc.â€“ are presented with sufficient expertise <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>even</b> the 2-D version an engrossing 2Â½-hour experience." ...|$|E

2500|$|The film gained {{unanimously}} poor reviews upon release, with Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu {{stating that}} the film [...] "falls flat due to identifiable reasonsâ€” the director has not done his homework properly, the dialogue makes you squirm at times, none of the actors seems involved in the role taken up and to top it all the lead pair fails <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>even</b> a slight impression".|$|E
