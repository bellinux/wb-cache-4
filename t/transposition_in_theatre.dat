Unlike core RAG 2, which supports robust <b>transposition</b> <b>in</b> vitro, full-length RAG 2 blocks transposition of signal ends following V(D) J cleavage. Thus, one role of this non-catalytic domain may be to prevent <b>transposition</b> <b>in</b> developing lymphoid cells.

40|$|In {{addition}} to their essential roles in V(D) J recombination, the RAG proteins {{have been found to}} catalyze <b>transposition</b> <b>in</b> vitro, but it has been difficult to demonstrate transposition by the RAG proteins in vivo in vertebrate cells. As genomic instability and chromosomal translocations are common outcomes of <b>transposition</b> <b>in</b> other species, it is critical to understand if the RAG proteins behave as a transposase in vertebrate cells. To facilitate this, we have developed an episome-based assay to detect products of RAG-mediated <b>transposition</b> <b>in</b> the human embryonic kidney cell line 293 T. Transposition events into the target episome, accompanied by characteristic target site duplications, were detected at a low frequency using RAG 1 and either truncated “core” RAG 2 or full-length RAG 2. More frequently, insertion of the RAG-generated signal end fragment into the target was accompanied by deletions or more complex rearrangements, and our data indicate that these events occur by a mechanism that is distinct from transposition. An assay to detect transposition from an episome into the human genome failed to detect bona fide transposition events but instead yielded chromosome deletion and translocation events involving the signal end fragment mobilized by the RAG proteins. These assays provide a means of assessing RAG-mediated <b>transposition</b> <b>in</b> vivo, and our findings provide insight into the potential for the products of RAG-mediated DNA cleavage to cause genome instability...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{generators}} tend to {{have high}} power. Normally, the armature winding of these generators consist of multiple strands insulated separately and transposed (using Roebel <b>transposition)</b> <b>in</b> order to suppress losses caused by eddy currents and circulating currents. As the generator reaches high power density, circulating currents in the armature winding are large, and hence the loss must be estimated accurately in generator design. Calculation of such losses requires the distribution of circulating currents, which differs from strand to strand. The Roebel bar optimum structure allows increasing machine efficiency, and consequently energy savings. In this thesis, the circulating currents in a Roebel transposed diamond coil have been studied. The Roebel <b>transposition</b> <b>in</b> the active part of the generator have been 180 ° and 360 °. Moreover the circulating currents for a traditional Roebel bar (no transposition at the end region) and for a Roebel bar with transposition at the end region {{has been carried out}}. Finally the values of circulating currents and the losses due to these currents for these Roebel bars have been compared. The study has been carried out using models of the winding developed in a FEM-program package. A 2 D model of the active part has been drawn in MagNet. From the flux linkages that are taken from the program the circulating currents has been calculated analytically. A 3 D model of the end region of the winding has been drawn in MagNet and the fields of this region has been studied. The circulating currents in half a coil has been investigated from the results obtained from the 2 D and 3 D simulations. The conclusions of the study are that using 360  <b>transposition</b> <b>in</b> the active part reduces the circulating currents almost to zero. 180  transposition reduces the circulating current. The study further concludes that using <b>transposition</b> <b>in</b> the end region reduces the circulating currents in the bar. Finally the study concludes that the minimum circulating current loss is achieved in case of 360  <b>transposition</b> <b>in</b> the active part (slot region) and <b>transposition</b> <b>in</b> the end region. It is also shown a cost-effective well chosen manufacturing process...|$|R

40|$|The RAG 1 and RAG 2 {{proteins}} perform critical DNA {{recognition and}} cleavage functions in V(D) J recombination, and also catalyze efficient DNA <b>transposition</b> <b>in</b> vitro. No <b>transposition</b> <b>in</b> vivo by the RAG proteins has been reported, suggesting {{regulation of the}} reaction by as yet unknown mechanisms. Here we report that RAG-mediated transposition is suppressed by physiological concentrations of the guanine nucleotide GTP, and by the full-length RAG 2 protein. Both GTP and full-length RAG 2 inhibit transposition by blocking the non-covalent ‘capture’ of target DNA, and both are capable of inhibiting RAG-mediated hybrid joint formation in vitro. We also observe that another intracellular signaling molecule, Ca 2 +, stimulates RAG-mediated transposition and is capable of activating <b>transposition</b> even <b>in</b> reactions containing full-length RAG 2 and GTP.
