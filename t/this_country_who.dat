2500|$|Chess {{historian}} Edward Winter {{writes that}} Leonard [...] "acquired fame among his contemporaries for his brilliant attacks and blindfold prowess". William Ewart Napier {{wrote in the}} mid-1930s, [...] "Among the neglected masters of <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> should be kindly remembered as exhibiting the premonitory signs and urge of champions was Leonard. In style, he was no doubt frankly satellited to Morphy, whose exploits were still a fresh memory in Leonard's day." ...|$|E

Today I know of {{very few}} and am {{personally}} acquainted {{with only two}} or three black preachers in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> emphasize the Scripture, stress the necessity of the new birth, and are in any degree biblical in their convictions or their preaching. [...] It is small wonder then that we are seeing a whole new generation of blacks come up in America who have little moral conviction." [...] (1985) ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2012, Santorum {{launched}} Patriot Voices, a 501(c)(4) non-profit with {{a mission}} to [...] "mobilize conservatives around <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> are committed to promoting faith, family, freedom and opportunity" [...] in support of causes and candidates across the country. Santorum supported U.S. Senate candidates Ted Cruz in Texas and Richard Mourdock in Indiana in their respective Republican primaries; both won their hotly contested primaries. In the general elections, Patriot Voices endorsed eight U.S. Senate candidates and four House candidates. Santorum also lent support to the [...] "NO Wiggins" [...] effort in Iowa to oust Iowa Supreme Court Justice David Wiggins in the 2012 retention elections, who they say carries a political and personal agenda in the court. They have also been vocal {{in opposition to the}} Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which they say threatens parental rights and U.S. sovereignty.|$|E
2500|$|Forth was {{in favour}} of capital punishment, but opposed {{corporal}} punishment in schools. After William Hague announced his support for an [...] "election compact" [...] promoted by the Commission for Racial Equality in 2001, Forth {{was quoted as saying}} at a private dinner: [...] "All this sucking up to minorities is ridiculous; there are millions of people in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> are white, Anglo-Saxon and bigoted {{and they need to be}} represented." [...] He opposed the BBC's spending money on a Nelson Mandela concert in 1988, saying [...] "those who want the arts and who support them should pay for them themselves". He also opposed the government spending on AIDS treatment, saying that the disease was [...] "largely self-inflicted". He was a fan of Elvis Presley and treasurer of the all-party Music Appreciation Group, and a couple of Presley's songs were played at Forth's memorial service in October 2006.|$|E
5000|$|Am I {{the only}} guy in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who's</b> fed up with what's happening? Where the hell is our outrage? We should be {{screaming}} bloody murder. We've got a gang of clueless bozos steering our ship of state right over a cliff, we've got corporate gangsters stealing us blind, and we can't even clean up after a hurricane much less build a hybrid car. But instead of getting mad, everyone sits around and nods their heads when the politicians say, [...] "Stay the course." [...] Stay the course? You've got to be kidding. This is America, not the damned Titanic. I'll give you a sound bite: Throw the bums out! ...|$|R

6000|$|Maccario’s eyes twinkled. “I {{believe they}} will. The Señor Harding’s {{generosity}} is well known,” he said. “In <b>this</b> <b>country</b> friends <b>who</b> are liberal {{with their money}} are scarce, and one {{is willing to do}} a little now and then to retain their good will. That, I think, is comprehensible. One has usually a motive.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Grant nodded gravely. [...] "Well," [...] he {{said very}} simply, [...] "I guess the Lord <b>who</b> made <b>this</b> <b>country</b> will know <b>who's</b> {{in the right}} and help them. They'll need it. There's a big fight coming." ...|$|R
2500|$|Lula {{served two}} terms as {{president}} and left office on 1 January 2011. During his farewell speech {{he said he felt}} an additional burden to prove that he could handle the presidency despite his humble beginnings.

6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] quoth Sir Tristram, [...] "and {{is there}} then no good knight-champion in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> will rid {{the world of}} such an evil being as that Sir Nabon of whom you speak?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It cannot be, lady," [...] said Du Guesclin. [...] "This night hath over wrought you, {{and your}} senses play you false. What men ere there in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> would sing {{in a strange}} tongue?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} know first for certain that they had ventured so far," [...] Mr. Sabin said. [...] "I believe that I am only the second person in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> {{has been so much}} honoured." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Mill {{uses the}} term “speculative” in a {{different}} sense from [...] that which is customary in <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> Merchants <b>who</b> buy [...] outright and store up grain are not speculators in the sense in [...] which the word is used with us; but those gamblers who purchase, [...] “for future delivery,” grain which they never see, and which they [...] sell in the same way, are here known as speculators.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Haldane; and Gordon {{and another}} chuckled silently. [...] "That is just why {{we want to}} see you safely out of <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> The man <b>who</b> drives that kind of bargain gives nobody else a show. Please sit down, gentlemen; I'll answer your {{questions}} later." ...|$|R
50|$|According {{to genetic}} studies, {{some of those}} who {{identify}} as White Brazilians (48.4%) also have some mixed-race ancestry (both Subsaharan African and Amerindian ancestry), not surprising given the multiracial history of <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> Brazilians <b>who</b> identify as de raça negra or de cor preta, i.e. Brazilians of Black African origin, make up 6.9% of the population; genetic studies show their average total ancestry is still mixed: 40% African, 50% European, and 10% Amerindian, but they likely grew up within visibly black communities.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he remarked, [...] "we play {{these games}} rather well; and, after all, {{is there any}} reason why we shouldn't? There are a good many people in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> don't {{consider}} them as of the first importance." ...|$|E
6000|$|A faint colour {{crept into}} Clavering's face. [...] "I know {{a good many}} which would make the bargain unfair to her," [...] he said, [...] "but {{there are very few}} men in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> would be good enough for her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{are only}} two persons in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> know {{anything}} of me,' replied the prisoner. 'One is a plain Liddesdale sheep-farmer, called Dinmont of Charlie's Hope; but he knows nothing more of me than what I told him, and what I now tell you.' ...|$|E
25|$|He {{was part}} of a forward-looking group of {{entrepreneurs}} in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> and abroad <b>who</b> believed that providing better living conditions for their workers resulted in better workers…Milton Hershey conceived of building a community that would support and nurture his workers. Developing the community became a lifelong passion for him.|$|R
50|$|This {{competition}} {{served as}} the final Olympic qualifier to the 2010 Winter Olympics. Eligible skaters qualified a spot to the Olympics for their country in order of their placement at this competition; there was no individual skater qualification. <b>Countries</b> <b>who</b> had already qualified a spot to the Olympics at the 2009 World Figure Skating Championships were not eligible to qualify more spots here, and their results were discounted from the overall results when allotting spots to countries. Unlike at the World Championships, where countries could qualify more than one spot depending on {{the placement of the}} skater, at <b>this</b> competition, <b>countries</b> <b>who</b> qualified were allotted only one spot to the Olympics, regardless of placement.|$|R
50|$|For {{many people}} Jane Manning {{is simply the}} voice of {{contemporary}} classical music in <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> Anyone <b>who</b> {{took an interest in}} this burgeoning area of music in the 1970s and '80s grew up with the sound of her astonishing voice in their ears. It’s instantly recognisable, but it’s also a chameleon. Whether she’s faced with the pure angular leaps of Anton Webern, the throaty suggestiveness of Schoenberg or the black, crazed humour of Gyorgy Ligeti, Jane Manning is always equal to the task.|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon so; but at {{the same}} time I'm bound to be with him, for if there is a man in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> can steer clear of trouble he is the one, and I don't care to be pulled on a charge of counterfeiting." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{has been}} stated that {{competition}} is an immense {{advantage in the}} extension of artistic knowledge among the people of <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> <b>who</b> are rapidly stepping {{on the heels of}} foreigners?--An acquaintance with what foreign nations have accomplished may be very useful to our workmen, but a spirit of competition with foreign nations is useful to no one.|$|E

"I find it," [...] she said, [...] "absolutely {{incumbent}} upon me, {{while on a}} visit to this metropolis, to cultivate the acquaintance of the women of <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> are in sympathy with the great movement in the States with which I am associated.

5000|$|A {{letter from}} 50 Republican {{national}} security officials was published on August 8. The senior officials, who included former White House officials and Cabinet secretaries, said Trump [...] "lacks the character, values, and experience" [...] to be President. Trump responded the same day, saying [...] "The names on this letter {{are the ones}} the American people should look to for answers on why {{the world is a}} mess, and we thank them for coming forward so everyone in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> knows <b>who</b> deserves the blame for making the world such a dangerous place." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Awareness of God, Trethowan writes [...] The most {{influential}} Christian philosophers in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> are Wittgensteinians <b>who</b> reject, for philosophical purposes, any {{talk about a}} spiritual principle in man. I am {{not the only person}} to disagree with them, but those who share my point of view have not, as yet, written books about it.|$|R
60|$|Of {{all these}} characters, {{the one that}} on the whole made the largest {{fortunes}} in the most rapid manner,--and we do not forget the marvels of the Waterloo loan, or the miracles of Manchester during the continental blockade--was the Anglo-East Indian {{about the time that}} Hastings was first appointed to the great viceroyalty. It was not unusual for men in positions so obscure that their names had never reached the public in <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> and <b>who</b> yet had not been absent from their native land for a longer period than the siege of Troy, to return with their million.|$|R
