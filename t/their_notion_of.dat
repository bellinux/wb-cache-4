[...] On this basis, Deleuze and Guattari develop <b>their</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> desiring-production.

In 1950, apostle and plant scientist John A.

2500|$|The Congress quickly {{came forward}} to defend {{soldiers}} of the INA who were to be court-martialled. The INA Defence Committee was formed by the Indian Congress and included prominent Indian legal figures, among whom were Jawaharlal Nehru, Bhulabhai Desai, Kailashnath Katju and Asaf Ali. The trials covered arguments based on military law, constitutional law, international law, and politics. Much of the initial defence {{was based on the}} argument that they should be treated as prisoners of war as they were not paid mercenaries but bona fide soldiers of a legal government– Bose's Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind. Nehru argued that [...] "however misinformed or otherwise they had been in <b>their</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> patriotic duty towards their country", they recognized the free Indian state as their sovereign and not the British sovereign. Peter Fay points out that at least one INA prisoner– Burhan-ud-Dina brother of the ruler of Chitral – may have deserved to be accused of torture, but his trial had been deferred on administrative grounds. Those charged after the first celebrated courts-martial only faced trial for torture and murder or abetment of murder. Charges of treason were dropped for fear of inflaming public opinion.|$|E
