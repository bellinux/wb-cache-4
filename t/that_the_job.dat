5|$|On June 8, 2017, Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo {{announced}} that they would upgrade the intersection of NY531 and NY36. This would improve the connection between NY531 and NY31 for safety purposes. Instead of the abrupt end at NY36, a new road would be constructed to connect NY531 and NY31. NY31 would be widened from Gallup Road to NY531; a center median would be added and a portion of NY31 between NY531 and NY36 would become a cul-de-sac for the residences in the area.

5|$|At the outset, the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and USCG {{agreed to}} recruit and to train the members of their {{respective}} women's reserves together, using existing Navy facilities. For recruiting purposes, the SPARS would utilize the Offices of the Naval Officer Procurement. Their first recruiting efforts got underway in December 1942, but they were hampered somewhat {{by the absence of}} SPAR recruiting personnel. Their absence resulted from the agreement between the Navy and the USCG, whereby the SPARS would receive its first personnel by transfer from the WAVES. A total of 15 WAVE officers and 153 WAVE enlisted women requested and were discharged from the WAVES to become the first SPARS. Eventually, SPAR officers were assigned to most of the Naval Officer Procurement offices. The recruiting information about SPARS was disseminated with WAVES publicity materials and it was also done separately. But it became apparent <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of selling the SPARS included selling the USCG as well.|$|E
5|$|For {{security}} reasons, Groves wanted H. K. Ferguson {{to operate}} the new plant, {{but it was a}} closed shop, and security regulations at the Clinton Engineer Works did not allow trade unions. To get around this, H. K. Ferguson created a wholly owned subsidiary, the Fercleve Corporation (from Ferguson of Cleveland), and the Manhattan District contracted it {{to operate the}} plant for $11,000 a month. Operating personnel for the new plant were initially trained at the Philadelphia pilot plant. In August 1944, Groves, Conant and Fox asked ten enlisted men of the Special Engineer Detachment (SED) at Oak Ridge for volunteers, warning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> would be dangerous. All ten volunteered. Along with four Fercleve employees, they were sent to Philadelphia to learn about the plant's operation.|$|E

40|$|Most {{scheduling}} models assume <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> have fixed processing times. However, in real-life applications {{the processing}} {{time of a}} job often depends {{on the amount of}} resources such as facilities, manpower, funds, etc. allocated to it, and so its processing time can be reduced when additional resources are assigned to <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> A scheduling problem in which the processing times of <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> can be reduced at some expense is called a scheduling problem with controllable processing times. In this paper we study <b>the</b> <b>job</b> shop scheduling problem under <b>the</b> assumption <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> have controllable processing times.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1925, Waugh's outlook briefly improved, with the {{prospect}} of a job in Pisa, Italy, as secretary to the Scottish writer Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff, who was engaged on the English translations of Marcel Proust's works. Believing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> was his, Waugh resigned his position at Arnold House. He had meantime sent the early chapters of his novel to Acton for assessment and criticism. Acton's reply was so coolly dismissive that Waugh immediately burnt his manuscript; shortly afterwards, before he left North Wales, he learned that the Moncrieff job had fallen through. The twin blows were sufficient for him to consider suicide. He records that he went down to a nearby beach and, leaving a note with his clothes, walked out to sea. An attack by jellyfish changed his mind, and he returned quickly to the shore.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile in Frankfurt, imprisoned {{biochemist}} David Robert Jones is {{visited by}} his lawyer Mr. Kohl (James Frain), who tells Jones <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> in Philadelphia was successful. Jones tells Kohl to wire Loeb another $100,000, {{and he makes}} a list of items he needs Kohl to bring on his next visit. Olivia visits Raul's wife Susan Lugo (Rosa Arredondo) and claims to have met her before as well, but Susan does not remember their meeting. She says the only people at a meeting Olivia describes were Raul, Susan, and John Scott (Mark Valley). Olivia realizes that she apparently still has his memories inside of her head, and is mixing them up with her own. Over at Massive Dynamic, Nina Sharp's (Blair Brown) attempts to delve into Scott's memories for information hit a dead end {{when they find out}} that crucial pieces of his memories are missing; they soon discover that the memories they need are in Olivia's mind.|$|E
5|$|Opponents in Brooktondale to the {{construction}} felt the removal of trees would ruin the village. Feeling that the village of Brooktondale was not likely to grow in population {{as a result of}} this project, they questioned its purpose. Ruining the scenic narrative of the area would be a waste of taxpayer dollars, since the road just ends at two dirt roads in Guideboard Corners. Despite the opposition, the state met with Caroline town officials and they noted that about 20 people were opposed to the project while a petition of 547 people supporting the job existed. In early July1962, the state gave the go-ahead for the project to begin, but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> would begin as early as 1963.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a processing system {{that consists of}} two identical parallel machines such <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> are delivered to the system by a single transporter and moved between the machines by the same transporter. The objective is to minimize {{the length of a}} schedule, i. e., the time by which <b>the</b> completed <b>jobs</b> are collected together on board <b>the</b> transporter. <b>The</b> <b>jobs</b> can be processed with preemption, provided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> portions of <b>jobs</b> are properly transported to the corresponding machines. We establish properties of feasible schedule, define lower bounds on the optimal length and describe an algorithm that behaves like a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) ...|$|R
5|$|Between 7:00a.m. and 8:00a.m. CT on March 3, {{the morning}} Fischer was killed, Olivarez {{confirmed}} with Garza {{at the motel}} that the murder was successful. He then went to Martínez' shop {{to tell her the}} teenager was dead. She told Garza that she would not give him the money unless there was solid proof that Fischer was dead. Garza then talked with Olivarez and Puentes Pizaña at the motel room. A few hours after the murder, Martínez phoned Cisneros and told her <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> had been carried out. Cisneros arrived at her store minutes later and left a sealed envelope with the money. Cisneros then went to St. Joe and picked up her daughter from school. Later that evening, Garza and Puentes Pizaña met with Martínez and picked up the envelope. They headed back to the motel and Garza handed over the envelope to Olivarez. Garza claims that the hitmen received $3,500, though he stated he never counted the money. Martínez said she did and that it was $3,000. Investigators believe it could have been as much as $5,000. Garza was then picked up by his nephew from Matamoros and taken to the Harlingen airport, where he flew back to San Antonio. On his way to the airport, he passed through Rancho Viejo and recalled seeing police cars and a house cordoned off with yellow tape.|$|E

25|$|The Corps {{immediately}} alerted Congress in May 1910 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> {{could not}} be done for the $100,000 appropriated. On June 17, Congress appropriated $200,000 more, and authorized the Corps to sign contracts for whatever services it needed (without regard to cost). In August, the Special Engineering Board decided not to bring the Maine back to the United States but to sink her at sea. The wreck would be surveyed before any work began. Caissons would then be constructed around the wreck to form a cofferdam, the water pumped out, and any bodies removed.|$|E

His appointment was criticised by former England captain Mike Atherton, who felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> should not have gone to someone {{who had been on}} the rebel tour of South Africa. His attitude came under fire from former coach Keith Fletcher, who accused him of being too fond of drinking and partying, {{to be a role model}} for young international cricketers. He hit back at Fletcher, criticising his management skills. Maynard continued to coach the England side and at one point drafted in professional lyricists to help him compose an England team song.|$|E
25|$|Because R. romandi nests {{can often}} be found on buildings, {{it is common for}} wasp nests to be built in heavily human {{populated}} areas. Their nests do not cause any structural damage, so if the nests are located in out of the way areas, they are best left alone. Attempting to knock them down will induce the aggressive behavior described above, and R. romandi tend to rebuild nests in similar spots. Additionally, paper wasps feed their young on caterpillars, so they can help eliminate common garden and agricultural pests. If one does {{have to get rid of}} a nest, it is recommended <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> is done by a professional exterminator, or with a fast acting can of insecticide. The best time to get rid of an R. romandi nest is at dawn or after dark when the wasps are most docile.|$|E
25|$|During {{the years}} {{following}} her dissertation, the research of Anna Christensen came {{to concentrate on the}} law of Welfare Society, i.e. those parts of the legal system that are developed to protect everyday life of the common men and women; Labour Law, Housing Law and Social Security Law were all to become her domain and main fields of research. In Disqualification from Unemployment Benefits (Avstängning från arbetslöshetsförsäkring), from 1980, Christensen studied the Swedish rules on disqualification from unemployment benefits on the ground of refusal of work and other self-imposed unemployment. The main {{purpose of the study was}} to disclose the control and steering of the citizens that is built into the Swedish social security system. According to Christensen, there was a strong interest on the part of the state to conceal the role <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Job</b> Service played in the system. Furthermore, Christensen meant that the state had an interest in concealing how the behavior-steering and repressive functions of the social security system were inseparably associated with the supportive functions of the system – a fact that contradicted the ideology surrounding the Welfare State. The study represented an important shift in Christensen’s research towards a more theoretical, social-science-oriented and critical approach.|$|E
