5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Dynamite Headdy was positive. Critics {{highlighted the}} game's originality and creativity in distinguishing it among other {{games in the}} action-platform genre. They also commended Treasure for demonstrating their <b>technical</b> <b>expertise</b> with impressive graphical effects and building {{on the success of}} their earlier game Gunstar Heroes (1993). In reviews from the time and in retrospect, Dynamite Headdy is cited for being one of the best games on the Genesis. An 8-bit port was released for Game Gear, which itself served as the basis for a Master System port released exclusively in Brazil.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Egyptians could {{fabricate}} a {{wide variety}} of objects from glass with great skill, {{but it is not clear}} whether they developed the process independently. It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have <b>technical</b> <b>expertise</b> in making objects, as well as adding trace elements to control the color of the finished glass. A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosthetic}} phase begins {{once the}} implant is well integrated (or has a reasonable assurance {{that it will}} integrate) and an abutment is in place to bring it through the mucosa. Even {{in the event of}} early loading (less than 3 months), many practitioners will place temporary teeth until osseointegration is confirmed. The prosthetic phase of restoring an implant requires an equal amount of <b>technical</b> <b>expertise</b> as the surgical because of the biomechanical considerations, especially when multiple teeth are to be restored. The dentist will work to restore the vertical dimension of occlusion, the esthetics of the smile, and the structural integrity of the teeth to evenly distribute the forces of the implants.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourth}} phase, low-lying casemates {{were added to}} the western and southwestern {{curtains}} to provide an additional platform for al-Rahba's defenders to use. The walls, particularly on the eastern side, were reinforced in the fifth phase, which Paillet attributes to the efforts of Shirkuh II and his Ayyubid contemporaries to strengthen the fortresses of Syria. The building technique used in this phase likely necessitated significant funds, equipment and <b>technical</b> <b>expertise.</b> Several changes were made including the southeastern tower being rebuilt and the northeastern tower being reinforced by an additional wall and a vaulted story. Moreover, the northern slope of the outer wall was further strengthened with a glacis built from large conglomerate blocks. A building in the center of al-Rahba was erected during this phase, likely replacing an older structure or a courtyard.|$|E
5|$|Completed scripts {{were sent}} to Studio B for {{pre-production}} and animation using Macromedia Flash Professional 8. Thiessen's production team was also allowed to select key personnel subject to Hasbro's approval; one of those selected was art director Ridd Sorensen. The Studio B team would storyboard the provided scripts, incorporating any direction and sometimes managing to create scenes that the writers had believed impossible to show in animation. The animators would then prepare the key character poses, layout, background art, and other main elements, and send these versions back to the production team in Los Angeles for review by Hasbro and suggestions from the writers. Thiessen credited much of the <b>technical</b> <b>expertise</b> in the show to Wooton, who created Flash programs to optimize the placement and posing of the pony characters and other elements, simplifying and economizing {{on the amount of}} work needed from the other animators. For example, the ponies' manes and tails are generally fixed shapes, animated by bending and stretching them in curves in three dimensions and giving them a sense of movement without the high cost of individual animated hairs. The storyboard artists and animators also need to fill in background characters for otherwise scripted scenes as to populate the world. According to writer Meghan McCarthy, many of the small nods to the fandom, pop culture references, or other easter eggs would be added at this point by the studio. Once the pre-production work was approved and completed, the episode would then be animated. Though Studio B performed the initial animation work, the final steps were passed to Top Draw Animation in the Philippines, an animation studio that Studio B had worked with in the later part of season one and beyond.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade {{we have seen a}} growing {{presence}} of tabletop systems applied to music, lately with even some products becoming commercially available and being used by professional musicians in concerts. The development of this type of applications requires several demanding <b>technical</b> <b>expertises</b> such as input processing, graphical design, real time sound generation or interaction design, and because of this complexity they are usually developed by a multidisciplinary group. In this paper we present the Musical Tabletop Coding Framework (MTCF) a framework for designing and coding musical tabletop applications by using the graphical programming language for digital sound processing Pure Data (Pd). With this framework we try to simplify the creation process of such type of interfaces, by removing the need of any programming skills other than those of Pd...|$|R
