5|$|During childhood, Goebbels {{suffered}} from ill health, {{which included a}} long bout of inflammation of the lungs. He had a deformed right foot <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> inwards, due to a congenital deformity. It was thicker and shorter than his left foot. He underwent a failed operation to correct it just prior to starting grammar school. Goebbels wore a metal brace and special shoe because of his shortened leg, and walked with a limp. He was rejected for military service in World War I due to his deformity.|$|E
5|$|A 1940 {{expedition}} by the American Museum of Natural History yielded more {{fossils of}} giant crocodilians, {{this time from}} Big Bend National Park in Texas. These specimens were described by Edwin H. Colbert and Roland T. Bird in 1954, under the name Phobosuchus riograndensis. Donald Baird and Jack Horner later assigned the Big Bend remains to Deinosuchus, which has been accepted by most modern authorities. The genus name Phobosuchus, which was initially created by Baron Franz Nopcsa in 1924, has since been discarded because it contained {{a variety of different}} crocodilian species <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> out to not be closely related to each other.|$|E

5|$|Angel {{improved}} the bread-making operation by introducing Israel's first automated weighing machines and investing in new production lines. He often slept overnight at the bakery {{during the week}} {{and returned to his}} home in Talpiot when the bakery was closed on Shabbat. Later he built an apartment over the bakery to house his family. In the 1930s, the bakery employed 25 workers and had one production line <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> out 8,500 loaves per day. It delivered bread to stores in two trucks and a horse and wagon. During World War II, the bakery contracted to supply bread to the British army, necessitating the purchase of large American-made ovens that could turn out 540 loaves per hour.|$|E
5|$|As Heyer aged {{she began}} to suffer more {{frequent}} health problems. In June 1964, she underwent surgery to remove a kidney stone. Although the doctors initially predicted a six-week recovery, after two months they predicted {{that it might be}} a year or longer before she felt completely well. The following year, she suffered a mosquito bite <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> septic, prompting the doctors to offer skin grafts. In July 1973 she suffered a slight stroke and spent three weeks in a nursing home. When her brother Boris died later that year, Heyer was too ill to travel to his funeral. She suffered another stroke in February 1974. Three months later, she was diagnosed with lung cancer, which her biographer attributed to the 60–80 cork-tipped cigarettes that Heyer smoked each day (although she said she did not inhale). On 4 July 1974, Heyer died. Her fans learned her married name for the first time from her obituaries.|$|E
5|$|At 00:05 on 15 April, Captain Smith {{ordered the}} ship's {{lifeboats}} uncovered and the passengers mustered. He also ordered the radio operators to begin sending distress calls, which wrongly placed the ship {{on the west}} side of the ice belt and directed rescuers to a position <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> out to be inaccurate by about 13.5 nautical miles (15.5mi / 25km). Below decks, water was pouring into the lowest levels of the ship. As the mail room flooded, the mail sorters made an ultimately futile attempt to save the 400,000items of mail being carried aboard Titanic. Elsewhere, air could be heard being forced out by inrushing water. Above them, stewards went door to door, rousing sleeping passengers and crew– Titanic did not have a public address system– and told them to go to the Boat Deck.|$|E

Burnett <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> into a fifteen-inning, five-hour-and-thirty-three-minute game. He threw seven shutout innings, Burnett threw seven and two thirds. The Red Sox eventually lost {{the game in the}} bottom of the 15th, when Alex Rodriguez hit a walk-off two run home run. He was 17–6 on the season, with a 3.86 ERA in 32 starts. He lost his one start in the postseason, to the Angels in game two of the 2009 ALDS.|$|E
5|$|Bedser was {{relieved}} after 70 minutes of bowling. The leg spin of Wright was introduced and Australia cut loose. Wright bowled a no ball that Morris dispatched into the leg side crowd for six, before hitting another ball for four. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Wright operated. The Australian captain drove the debutant Coxon through the covers for two fours, and Yardley made frequent rotations of his bowlers. Coxon continued to significantly rough up the pitch outside the right-handed batsman's leg stump, {{and from the}} other, Wright was able to extract substantial spin on the first morning of the match, hitting Morris in the stomach with a ball <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> in sharply from outside off stump. At lunch, Australia were 82/1 with Morris on 45 and Bradman 35. The tourists had largely been content to wait for loose deliveries, rather than take risks, and as the Englishmen bowled accurately, the Australians did not score quickly.|$|E
5|$|Following training, the {{battalion}} was deployed to New Guinea, arriving in Milne Bay in early August 1943. It saw {{action in the}} final stages of the Salamaua–Lae campaign in September 1943. The 2/15 took part in the landing at Lae, the first amphibious operation undertaken by Australian forces since the failed Gallipoli campaign in 1915. During the operation, the 2/15th was initially assigned the task of securing the beachhead following the 20th Brigade's landing. After being relieved it joined the advance west towards the town, slowed by heavy rains <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> the many creeks in the area into raging torrents, which were invariably covered by heavy Japanese fire from the opposite bank.|$|E

5|$|Hornung {{finished}} {{his work with}} the YMCA and returned to England probably in early 1919, according to Rowland. He worked on a new novel but was hampered by poor health. His wife's health was of even greater concern, so in February 1921 they took a holiday {{in the south of}} France to recuperate. He fell ill on the train with a chill <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> into influenza and pneumonia from which he died on 22 March 1921, aged 54. He was buried in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, in the south of France, in a grave adjacent to that of George Gissing. Doyle, returning from a spiritualist lecture tour of Australia, received the news in Paris and travelled south in time for the funeral.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 and 2007, {{a number}} of {{leveraged}} buyout transactions were completed which, for the first time, surpassed the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price. The deal was first surpassed in July 2006 by the $33 billion buyout of U.S. hospital operator Hospital Corporation of America, in which KKR participated, though the RJR deal was larger, adjusted for inflation. However, adjusted for inflation, none of the leveraged buyouts of the 2006–07 period would surpass RJR Nabisco. The RJR transaction benefited many of the parties involved. Investment bankers and lawyers who advised KKR walked away with over $1 billion in fees. Kravis and Roberts attracted an unprecedented amount of publicity <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> the cousins into instant celebrities. Size did not, however, guarantee success as the high purchase price and debt load would burden {{the performance of the}} investment, which KKR overcame, raising a new investment fund and continuing to invest throughout the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In February 1334 Montagu {{was sent}} on a {{commission}} to Edinburgh, to demand Edward Balliol's homage to Edward. In the great summer campaign of 1335, it was Montagu who provided the largest English contingent, with 180 men-at-arms and 136 archers. He was well rewarded for his contributions: after the Scots {{had been forced to}} cede the Lowlands, Montagu was granted the county of Peeblesshire. He was also allowed to buy the wardship of Roger Mortimer's son Roger for 1000 marks, a deal <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> out to be very lucrative for Montagu. At this point, however, the fortunes were turning for the English in Scotland. Montagu campaigned in the north again in 1337, but the siege of Dunbar met with failure. Following the abortive attempt in Scotland, Edward III {{turned his attention to the}} continent.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} {{influence}} on events, {{it was more}} than Napoleon's personality that took effect. He reorganized France itself to supply the men and money needed for wars. He inspired his men—Wellington said his presence on the battlefield was worth 40,000 soldiers, for he inspired confidence from privates to field marshals. He also unnerved the enemy. At the Battle of Auerstadt in 1806, King Frederick William III of Prussia outnumbered the French by 63,000 to 27,000; however, when he was told, mistakenly, that Napoleon was in command, he ordered a hasty retreat <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> into a rout. The force of his personality neutralized material difficulties as his soldiers fought with the confidence that with Napoleon in charge they would surely win.|$|E
5|$|In the Second Test at Lord's, Australia {{elected to}} bat first and England made an ideal start. The debutant Alec Coxon opened the bowling and removed Barnes for a duck {{in his second}} over to leave the {{tourists}} at 1/3. England restricted the Australians in the first hour and created several near misses, particularly against Bradman, who nervous early on. In contrast, Morris was playing fluently and scored many runs from the back cut. At {{the end of the}} pace bowlers' opening spells, the leg spin of Doug Wright was introduced and Australia cut loose. Wright bowled a no ball that Morris dispatched over the leg side fence for six, before hitting another ball for four. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Wright operated steadily, although the latter was able to extract substantial spin, hitting Morris in the stomach with a ball <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> in sharply from outside off stump. At lunch, Australia were 1/82 with Morris on 45 and Bradman on 35.|$|E
5|$|Nicholson was {{at first}} seen as an {{improvement}} over the Catholic Thomas Dongan, the outgoing governor. However, the province's old guard was unhappy that Andros removed all of the provincial records to Boston, and then Nicholson alarmed the sometimes hardline Protestant population by preserving the trappings of the chapel in Fort James that Dongan and the handful of New York's Catholics had used for worship. In response to a rumored Dutch invasion of England (a rumor <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> out to be true), Nicholson in January 1689 ordered the provincial militias to be on alert to protect the province for the king. Unknown to Nicholson, events in England had already changed things.|$|E

5|$|On Saturday, 5 October 1985, a {{week after}} the Brixton riot, police arrested Floyd Jarrett, a 24-year-old black man from Tottenham, on {{suspicion}} of being in a stolen car. It was a suspicion <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> out to be groundless, but a decision was made several hours later to search the home of his mother, Cynthia Jarrett, for stolen goods. In the course of the search she collapsed and died of heart failure. Rose writes that the pathologist, Walter Somerville, told the inquest that Mrs Jarrett had a heart condition that meant she probably only had months to live.|$|E
5|$|Other {{pressures}} on O'Neill's colonization plan were {{the high cost}} of access to Earth orbit and the declining cost of energy. Building solar power stations in space was economically attractive when energy prices spiked during the 1979 oil crisis. When prices dropped in the early 1980s, funding for space solar power research dried up. His plan had also been based on NASA's estimates for the flight rate and launch cost of the Space Shuttle, numbers <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> out to have been wildly optimistic. His 1977 book quoted a Space Shuttle launch cost of $10 million, but in 1981 the subsidized price given to commercial customers started at $38 million. Eventual accounting of the full cost of a launch in 1985 raised this as high as $180 million per flight.|$|E
5|$|The arms of I. bernissartensis {{were long}} (up to 75% {{the length of}} the legs) and robust, with rather {{inflexible}} hands built so that the three central fingers could bear weight. The thumbs were conical spikes that stuck out away from the three main digits. In early restorations, the spike was placed on the animal's nose. Later fossils revealed {{the true nature of the}} thumb spikes, although their exact function is still debated. They could have been used for defense, or for foraging for food. The little finger was elongated and dextrous, and could have been used to manipulate objects. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-3-2-4, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, etc. The legs were powerful, but not built for running, and each foot had three toes. The backbone and tail were supported and stiffened by ossified tendons, which were tendons <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> to bone during life (these rod-like bones are usually omitted from skeletal mounts and drawings).|$|E
