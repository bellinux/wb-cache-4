This paper also examines such considerations as cost-effectiveness, conftdentiality, and credibility as they relate to DTP systems and uses. Also considered are the possible impact DTP could have on the amount of paper-based communication produced, an increase in training in layout and design, and formal researching DTP strategies and effects. ’I] y now virtually everyone has heard the term, &dquo;desktop publishing,&dquo;which is the current buzz-word for producing documents with al-most <b>typeset</b> <b>quality</b> using equipment that can sit on a desktop.

The core of the system is a powerful SGML structure editor Grif combining the advantages of a WYSIWYG approach and structure editing.

The results indicated that resumes should be written on white paper and that typeset resumes are evaluated the same as resumes printed with a high quality typewriter.

Using these two variables, the question posed is, “Does paper color and/or type of print on a resume influence its desirability as in initial selection tool...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose to}} create a new model for {{multilingual}} computerized typesetting, in which each of language, script, font and character is treated as a multidimensional entity, and all combine to form a multidimensional context. Typesetting is undertaken in a typographical space, and becomes a multiple-stage process of preparing the input stream for typesetting, segmenting the stream into clusters or words, typesetting these clusters, and then recombining them. Each of the stages, including their respective algorithms, is dependent on the multidimensional context. This approach will support <b>quality</b> <b>typesetting</b> for a number of modern and ancient scripts. The paper and talk will show how these are to be implemented in Ω...|$|R

40|$|A {{major problem}} for the {{acceptance}} of mathematical proof assistance systems in mathematical practise is the shortcomings of their user interfaces. Often the interfaces are developed bottom-up starting from the mathematical proof assistance system. Therefore they usually focus on the individual system and its proof development paradigm and neglect traditional forms to communicate proofs as used by mathematicians. To address this problem we propose a top-down approach where we start from an existing scientific WYSIWYG text editor which supports the preparation of mathematical publications in high <b>quality</b> <b>typesetting</b> and integrate a mathematical proof assistance system to support proof development and validation. Concretely, we extend the document format of the text editor by semantic markup to encode formal mathematical content and {{to communicate with the}} formal system. Additionally we provide interaction markup defining contextsensitive means to control the mathematical proof assistance system through the text editor...|$|R
40|$|High <b>quality</b> <b>typesetting</b> of {{mathematical}} formulas is a quite tedious task. One {{of the most}} sophisticated typesetting programs for mathematical text TEX [?], together with its widely used macro package LATEX [?], has a strange syntax {{of mathematical}} formulas, especially of the complicated type. This is the main reason which lead us to designing the formula interface between the computer algebra system REDUCE and the document preparation system LATEX. The other reason is that all available syntaxes of the REDUCE formula output are line oriented and thus not suitable for typesetting in mathematical text. The idea of interfacing a computer algebra system to a typesetting program has already been used, eg. in [?] presenting the TEX output of the MACSYMA computer algebra system. The formula interface presented here adds to REDUCE the new syntax of formula output, namely L ATEX syntax, and can also be named REDUCE-L ATEX translator. Text generated by REDUCE in this syntax can be directly used in L ATEX source documents. Various mathematical constructions ar...|$|R

40|$|The thesis "Typography of {{the monthly}} {{magazine}} Žena a móda (1949 - 1995) " deals with the graphical appearance of this magazine and describes the changes in its typography. Magazine ran from January 1949 to July 1995, when it was cancelled because of financial difficulties. The aim of this thesis is to divide the years of Žena a móda's existence into periods, depending on its specific graphical appearance. This bachelor thesis outlines the historical context, technical conditions and the influence the Marxism-Leninism had on the graphic design. Moreover, the basic vocabulary of typographical terms is included. The thesis analyses the graphical appearance of the magazine periodically, with the focus on physical <b>qualities,</b> <b>typesetting,</b> typeface, headlines, front pages or advertisement. Furthermore, the graphical appearance of the world's most famous magazines is outlined briefly {{towards the end of}} the thesis, as well as the magazine's competition after 1989.
