25|$|The {{singular}} number {{indicates that}} the denoted thing is one or indivisible (as in méilė – love, smė̃lis – sand, píenas – milk). The plural number, when it can be {{in contrast with the}} singular, indicates that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the things denoted by the word. But sometimes, when a word doesn't have the singular number, being a plurale tantum noun, the plural form doesn't indicate real singularity or plurality of the denoted object(s).|$|E
25|$|Much {{the same}} {{considerations}} apply to bass drum pedals and the stool, {{but these are}} not always considered breakables, particularly if changeover time between bands is very limited. Swapping the snare drum in a standard kit can be done very quickly. Replacing cymbals on stands takes longer, particularly if <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them, and cymbals are easily damaged by incorrect mounting, so many drummers prefer to bring their own cymbal stands.|$|E

25|$|Two {{problems}} ensue {{from the}} multiplicity of transcription systems used for Tlingit. One is that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them, thus requiring any reader to learn each individual system depending on what sources are used. The second problem is that most transcriptions made before Franz Boas's study of Tlingit have numerous mistakes in them, particularly because of misinterpretations of the short vowels and ejective consonants. Thus {{it is important to}} check any given transcription against similar words in other systems, or ideally against a modern work postdating Naish and Story's work in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{represent}} tries, corresponding to different trade-offs between memory use and speed of the operations. The basic form is that of a linked set of nodes, where each node contains an array of child pointers, one for each symbol in the alphabet (so for the English alphabet, one would store 26 child pointers and for the alphabet of bytes, 256 pointers). This is simple but wasteful in terms of memory: using the alphabet of bytes (size 256) and four-byte pointers, each node requires a kilobyte of storage, and when there is little overlap in the strings' prefixes, the number of required nodes is roughly the combined length of the stored strings. Put another way, the nodes {{near the bottom of the}} tree tend to have few children and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them, so the structure wastes space storing null pointers.|$|E
500|$|Bevin {{advocated}} {{shifting the}} state's tax code away from [...] "productivity" [...] taxes, such as income taxes, to [...] "consumption taxes" [...] such as sales taxes, {{a move that}} Conway called [...] "regressive". He repeated his call to eliminate the inheritance tax and added that the state should [...] "aim for" [...] the elimination of corporate taxes. Bevin also called {{for the elimination of}} many of Kentucky's $10 billion in [...] "tax expenditures", which he called [...] "Frankfort-speak for loopholes". Asked to specify which expenditures he would eliminate, Bevin said, [...] "I'm {{not going to give you}} specifics at this point in time. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> these loopholes that frankly are not conducive to developing the economy. There are some that make sense, and those will continue. ...e have already identified what many of them will be. But at this point, we're going to have to look at them in totality. I'm not gonna give you specifics at this time. I'm just not." ...|$|E

2500|$|Micro hydro is a {{term used}} for {{hydroelectric}} power installations that typically produce up to [...] of power. These installations can provide power to an isolated home or small community, or are sometimes connected to electric power networks. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> these installations around the world, particularly in developing nations as they can provide an economical source of energy without purchase of fuel. Micro hydro systems complement photovoltaic solar energy systems because in many areas, water flow, and thus available hydro power, is highest in the winter when solar energy is at a minimum.|$|E
2500|$|Dennett makes a {{distinction}} between the presence of representation, and the representation of presence. The example he gives regarding this distinction is this: if you were to walk into a room covered in identical portraits of Marilyn Monroe, you would see that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them, but you would not really be seeing them all at once. There would be no detailed representation of each individual portrait just the knowledge that they are present. Dennet's theory raises two relevant questions: 1) How does the visual system detect change in the environment? 2) How much information is retained in each saccade? The proposed answer to these questions lies in several mechanisms that support a high sensitivity to change in each visual fixation. These mechanisms are: retinal adaptation, [...] "pop-out" [...] systems, and motion detectors. The implication of this view is that little information is needed to be retained between each saccade.|$|E
2500|$|Iron was {{produced}} in bloomeries made of clay, using the technique of « direct iron reduction », and forge-wrought on the spot. The people living there were Senones. This place is less than [...] (on a beeline) from the Loire river and from the Bituriges, to whom is attributed the discovery of tinning and who were held among the best regarding their metalwork in general and ironwork in particular. The oldest bloomeries studied in France, some [...] "trapped slag" [...] furnaces (fours à [...] scories piégées) giving off only a low production, are {{in the area of}} Sens only 50 miles away to the north and may date from the 7th century BC. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> those in the south of Puisaye, their quantity decreasing towards the north of that area. Towards the end of the Tene era (from about 500 BC to the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC), all the large exploitation sites of Puisaye seem to have increased their size and perfected their equipment.|$|E
