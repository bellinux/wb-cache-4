50|$|Decrees of 24 June 1872 and 29 May 1873 {{laid down}} plans for fortifications in the Empire and {{permitted}} the confiscation {{of land for}} that purpose. A preliminary plan was completed on 1 June 1873, containing 8 main forts and 3 intermediate forts. This {{was presented to the}} Commission by a decree of 31 March 1874; the Commission completed its work on the plan on 7 April 1874, and it was approved by the War Ministry in a decree of 17 November 1874.

An act of the Reichstag of 30 May 1873 allocated over 7 million <b>talars</b> for the project (the fifth largest amount granted for fort modernization).

Bastions III and V were first to be built. Work was interrupted in 1848 due to the Greater Poland Uprising and [...] "Spring of Nations". Later Bastions IV, VI, II and I were constructed, and in 1860-1861 connecting roads were built, {{as well as a number}} of brick blockhouses. This completed the ring (enceinte) around the left-bank city. Each of the six bastions had a large caponier shielded by embankments connected to the cavaliers. There was also a separate caponier on Grobla (Graben) island, beyond the Graben Schleuse weir.|$|R
50|$|In the meantime, Khmelnytsky (also {{suffering}} from heavy desertions) decided to enter {{negotiations with the}} Poles. The Treaty of Cudnów was signed on 17 October, and mostly repeated the 1657 Treaty of Hadiach (although the creation of Duchy of Ruthenia had to be confirmed by the Polish king) and pledged Cossaks allegiance to the Poles. Having learned that Khmelnytsky signed the treaty with the Poles, Tsetsura decided to defect, and did so on 21 October (his Cossacks were however ambushed by the Tatars and suffered heavy casualties). The Cossacks were no longer allied with the Russians. One Russian army was defeated in the north, and another one tied up in Kiev, where they suspected a Polish-Cossack uprising may occur. Russian commander Boriatyński in Kiev was able to muster only about 5,000-strong army, but retreated to Kiev having learned that Polish reinforcements (numbering about few thousands and led by Stefan Czarniecki and Jakub Potocki) were approaching. Abandoned by his allies, and failing {{to break through the}} Polish lines on 22 October, Sheremetev decided to enter negotiations on 23 October; he capitulated on 4 November. The Russians were allowed to retreat but had to leave their weapons, abandon Kiev, Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi and Chernihiv and pay 300,000 <b>talars.</b> Sheremetev and several of his officers were to remain Polish prisoners.|$|R
2500|$|After the German student movement, {{following}} {{the years of}} 1967 all West German universities dropped their academic dress because they were identified with right-winged conservatism and reactionism by the mostly socialist influenced students at that time: The famous slogan [...] "Unter den Talaren – Muff von 1000 Jahren" [...] (beneath the gowns the [...] of 1000 years) refers {{not only to the}} old traditions of the Middle Ages, but also to the Nazi regime and their self-declared [...] "empire of 1000 years". In East Germany, which was a communist one-party state, Talare were abolished by law at the same time. After East Germany began to dissolve in 1989, several universities, particularly University of Rostock, University of Greifswald, University of Jena, and University of Halle-Wittenberg, resurrected lost traditions including the <b>Talar</b> for officials.
