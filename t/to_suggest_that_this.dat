5|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter and dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and there is much <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the kind of environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread by following the coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} among his contemporaries for untruth and fantasy, Morrell has been defended by some later commentators who, while questioning his general reliability, maintain {{that not all}} his life was fraud and exaggeration. They believe that aside from the bombast and boastful tone of the account that carries his name, {{there is evidence that}} he carried out useful work, such his discovery of large-scale guano deposits which {{led to the development of}} a full-scale industry. He is believed to have died in 1838 or 1839, in Mozambique; there is, however, evidence <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> death might have been staged, and that he lived on in exile, possibly in South America.|$|E

25|$|Since Moses is {{described}} by the Bible as encountering Jethro, a Kenite who was a Midianite priest, shortly before encountering Sinai, this suggests that Sinai would be somewhere near their territory in Saudi Arabia; the Kenites and Midianites appear to have resided east of the Gulf of Aqaba. Additionally, the Song of Deborah, which some textual scholars consider {{one of the oldest}} parts of the Bible, portrays God as having dwelt at Mount Seir, and seems <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> equates with Mount Sinai; Mount Seir designates the mountain range in the centre of Edom.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> edict was largely ignored in the Roman provinces, wine historians have debated {{the effect of the}} edict on the infant wine industries of Spain and Gaul. The intent of the edict was that fewer vineyards would result in only enough wine for domestic consumption, with sparse amount for trade. While vineyards were already established in these growing wine regions, the ignoring of trade considerations may have suppressed the spread of viticulture and winemaking in these areas. Domitian's edict remained in effect for nearly two centuries until Emperor Probus repealed the measure in 280 AD.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between Liddell and Dodgson {{has been the}} source of much controversy. Dodgson met the Liddell family in 1855; he first befriended Harry, the older brother, and later took both Harry and Ina on several boating trips and picnics to the scenic areas around Oxford. Later, when Harry went to school, Alice and her younger sister Edith joined the party. Dodgson entertained the children by telling them fantastic stories to while away the time. He also used them as subjects for his hobby, photography. It has often been stated that Alice was clearly his favourite subject in these years, but there is very little evidence <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is so; Dodgson's diaries from 18 April 1858 to 8 May 1862 are missing.|$|E

5000|$|In 1990, Peter Dodson and Phil Currie {{placed it}} in the Chasmosaurinae. The phylogenetic {{analysis}} conducted by Ryan et al. (2010) confirmed this assignment. Modern cladistic analyses usually recover Anchiceratops in a more advanced position within the Chasmosaurinae, closer to Arrhinoceratops than to Chasmosaurus. [...] Mallons study of 2012 concluded however, that Anchiceratops was {{more closely related to}} Chasmosaurus than <b>to</b> Triceratops, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> genus was less derived than previously thought.|$|R

As it turned out, {{the use of the}} word dogma caused almost more trouble than it was worth. Many years later Jacques Monod pointed out to me that I did not appear to understand the correct use of the word dogma, which is a belief that cannot be doubted. I did apprehend this in a vague sort of way but since I thought that all religious beliefs were without foundation, I used the word the way I myself thought about it, not as most of the world does, and simply applied it to a grand hypothesis that, however plausible, had little direct experimental support." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{fighting}} {{was focused on}} Munster; Máel Sechnaill sought to increase his influence over the kings there. He took hostages from the province in 854, 856 and 858, {{and the power of}} the over-kings had been weakened in 856 by a Viking raid on the royal centre at Lough Cend, when Gormán son of Lonán, a relative of Munster's over-king, was killed alongside a great many others. This weakness likely drew the gaze of both Máel Sechnaill and the Vikings, and their competition for Munster's resources may have been the cause of the war. Early battles seem to have gone the way of the Vikings: Amlaíb and Ímar [...] "inflicted a rout on Caitill the Fair and his Norse-Irish in the lands of Munster". Although there is no certain evidence <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> Caitill is the same person as the Ketill Flatnose of later sagas, Anderson and Crawford have suggested that they are the same person.|$|E
500|$|The {{charters}} constitute valuable {{evidence for}} prosopographical {{research and the}} study of land tenure in late Anglo-Saxon England. According to Donald A. Bullough, they also offer a window on the kind of social bonds which could be created by [...] "neighbourhood". In the 10th century, the Bishop of Worcester leased out various small estates attached to the Church in the three counties (Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and Warwickshire) to several high-ranking men and women, usually for three lifespans. The pattern may be taken <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> way of association served to [...] "create a network, an inter-meshing, of high-status 'neighbours' ... with its central knot in Worcester and the domus of the bishop". In the bishop's residence or at home, the lessees may have come together to participate in convivial drinking, just as the Norman successors to these lands are envisaged as doing in William of Malmesbury's Life of St Wulfstan. Further, some of the thegns served in the royal army (fyrd) under the command of Bishop Oswald or his successors, which presupposes the creation of a personal warband and possibly one with the secondary purpose of protecting the bishop's properties.|$|E

50|$|The {{creation}} of the above Mudaliyar class by the British in the 19th century, its restriction only to the Govigama caste, production of spurious caste hierarchy lists by this class and changes to the land tenure system, resulted in this caste too being classified as a low caste during this period.

500|$|A Wizard of Earthsea {{has strong}} {{elements}} of an epic; for instance, Ged's place in Earthsea history is described {{at the very}} beginning of the book in the following terms: [...] "some say the greatest, and surely the greatest voyager, was the man called Sparrowhawk, who in his day became both dragonlord and Archmage." [...] The story also begins with words from the Earthsea song [...] "The Creation of Éa", which forms a ritualistic beginning to the book. The teller of the story then goes on to say that it is from Ged's youth, thereby establishing context for the rest of the book. In comparison with the protagonists of many of Le Guin's other works, Ged is superficially a typical hero, a mage who sets out on a quest. Reviewers have compared A Wizard of Earthsea to epics such as Beowulf. Scholar Virginia White argued that the story followed a structure common to epics in which the protagonist begins an adventure, faces trials along the way, and eventually returns in triumph. White went on <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> structure can be seen in the series as a whole, as well as in the individual volumes.|$|E
500|$|Schumacher won six of {{the first}} seven races and was leading the , before a gearbox failure left him stuck in fifth gear. Schumacher {{finished}} the race in second place. Following the San Marino Grand Prix, the Benetton, Ferrari and McLaren teams were investigated on suspicion of breaking the FIA-imposed ban on electronic aids. Benetton and McLaren initially refused to hand over their source code for investigation. When they did so, the FIA discovered hidden functionality in both teams' software, but no evidence {{that it had been}} used in a race. Both teams were fined $100,000 for their initial refusal to cooperate. However, the McLaren software, which was a gearbox program that allowed automatic shifts, was deemed legal. By contrast, the Benetton software was deemed to be a form of [...] "launch control" [...] that would have allowed Schumacher to make perfect starts, which was explicitly outlawed by the regulations. However, there was no evidence <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> software was actually used. [...] At the , Schumacher was penalised for overtaking on the formation lap. He then ignored the penalty and the subsequent black flag, which indicates that the driver must immediately return to the pits, for which he was disqualified and later given a two-race ban. Benetton blamed the incident on a communication error between the stewards and the team. Schumacher was also disqualified after winning the [...] after his car was found to have illegal wear on its skidblock, a measure used after the accidents at Imola to limit downforce and hence cornering speed. Benetton protested that the skidblock had been damaged when Schumacher spun over a kerb, but the FIA rejected their appeal because of the pattern of wear and damage visible on the block. These incidents helped Damon Hill close the points gap, and Schumacher led by a single point going into the final race in Australia. On lap 36 Schumacher hit the guardrail {{on the outside of the}} track while leading. Hill attempted to pass, but as Schumacher's car returned to the track there was a collision on the corner causing them both to retire. As a result, Schumacher won a very controversial championship, the first German to do so (Jochen Rindt raced under the Austrian flag). At the FIA conference after the race, the new World Champion dedicated his title to Ayrton Senna.|$|E
