25|$|Hauerwas finds {{these two}} moral {{theories}} very limiting {{because they are}} quandary ethics, cases that rely on extreme situations. He believes that <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> third reasoning that falls somewhere in between these two. He believes that the basic doctor-patient relationship should be built on trust and caring. This characterizes him as more of deontological thinker; however, he does believe in research on human beings. Hauerwasâ€™s perspective is that <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> middle ground between these two perspectives. The patient becomes dehumanized through research; however, without this research {{there would be little}} medical improvement. Hauerwas therefore believes this middle ground should focus on caring for the patient instead of curing. With this, Hauerwas believes {{we do not have the}} moral understanding to handle current medicine.|$|E
25|$|Each {{of these}} {{problems}} are quite simple to solve technically in conjunction with user education and follow-up visits. However, <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> commitment and willingness by the users or caretakers to resolve such problems. Due to insufficient commitment, user preparation, follow-up and support, such operational problems have on occasion led to abandonment, {{as in the case}} of several UDDT pilot projects.|$|E

25|$|When {{the seal}} is pressed onto the {{printing}} surface, the procedure differs according to plant or silk based paste. For silk based paste, the user applies pressure, {{often with a}} specially made soft, flat surface beneath the paper. For plant based paste, the user simply applies light pressure. As lifting the seal vertically away from its imprint may rip or damage paper, the seal is usually lifted off one side at a time, as if bent off from the page. After this, the image may be blotted {{with a piece of}} paper to make it dry faster, although this may smudge it. Usually <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> pile of soft felt or paper under the paper to be imprinted for a clear seal impression.|$|E
25|$|During {{the day the}} sun has {{different}} positions. For low concentration systems (and low temperatures) tracking can be avoided (or limited to a few positions per year) if nonimaging optics are used. For higher concentrations, however, if the mirrors or lenses do not move, then {{the focus of the}} mirrors or lenses changes (but also in these cases nonimaging optics provides the widest acceptance angles for a given concentration). Therefore, it seems unavoidable that <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> tracking system that follows the position of the sun (for solar photovoltaic a solar tracker is only optional). The tracking system increases the cost and complexity. With this in mind, different designs can be distinguished in how they concentrate the light and track the position of the sun.|$|E

25|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this approach}} is that it is trivial, based on the trivial observation that mathematics is a human activity. To observe that rigorous proof comes only after unrigorous conjecture, experimentation and speculation is true, but it is trivial and no-one would deny this. So it's a bit of a stretch to characterize a philosophy of mathematics in this way, on something trivially true. The calculus of Leibniz and Newton was reexamined by mathematicians such as Weierstrass in order to rigorously prove the theorems thereof. There is nothing special or interesting about this, as it fits in with the more general trend of unrigorous ideas which are later made rigorous. <b>There</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> clear distinction between the objects of study of mathematics and the study of the objects of study of mathematics. The former doesn't seem to change a great deal; the latter is forever in flux. The latter is what the social theory is about, and the former is what Platonism et al. are about.|$|E
500|$|Also, before {{applying}} this test in considering if {{a piece of}} legislation contravenes Article 12, <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> presumption that an impugned law is constitutional. This presumption of constitutionality stems from the wide power of classification which the legislature has to make laws which operate differently as regards different groups of persons, so as to give effect to its policies. An academic, Tan Yock Lin, has acknowledged the benefit of this presumption as it [...] "tells the challenger what he must do". The person challenging the constitutionality of a legislative or executive classification must expect to [...] "furnish cogent and compelling evidence of unequal treatment". Postulating examples will not be sufficient for the purposes of rebuttal. However, Tan has pointed out that this results in additional indeterminacy for {{it is not clear what}} level of cogency will satisfy the court of the viability of the challenge.|$|E

To American Songwriter, Philip Lawrence from The Smeezingtons recalled sleepless nights during the record's process, as the team was trying to prove that the debut album [...] "wasn't a fluke", which according to Lawrence is [...] "the absolute wrong mind-set to be". He went on expressing that the first four or five months they worked on the record were fruitless, because [...] "nothing would stick". When they decided to leave the studio and have a few drinks, they came to conclusion to relax and not put themselves under so much pressure; it resulted in [...] "the ideas [...] coming out again." ...|$|E

500|$|In a 2013 storyline, when investigative {{journalist}} Betty Brant incorrectly concludes that Miles' father, Jefferson, {{is the new}} Spider-Man, she is murdered by Markus, who has become the newest host to the Venom symbiote. In the subsequent [...] "Venom War" [...] storyline, Venom confronts Jefferson at his home, where Spider-Man repels the creature. Jefferson is critically injured and hospitalized in this battle, and when Venom pursues him at the hospital, Spider-Man again confronts him, during which Miles' mother, Rio, also learns that her son is Spider-Man. By {{the end of the}} brawl, Marcus killed by police gunfire, as is Rio, who tells Miles not to reveal his secret to his father before dying. Miles quits being Spider-Man as a result. A year later he has a girlfriend named Katie Bishop, and is planning on telling her about his former life as Spider-Man. Though he has not engaged in heroics in a year, he is pressured to return to that life by S.H.I.E.L.D. He reluctantly does so, after Ganke and Spider-Woman convince him that <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Spider-Man. After he and his allies expose the criminal activity of Roxxon executive Donald Roxxon, Miles thanks Ganke for his support, and affirms in earnest that he is Spider-Man.|$|E
500|$|For season three, Mack {{wanted the}} {{character}} {{to be given}} a major obstacle to overcome, something that would help the character mature. The obstacle in question became Lionel's control over Chloe, after she made a deal to spy on Clark. Allison Mack believes that Chloe is in her own comfort zone while she is working at the Torch, as she is in complete control, but likens Chloe being under Lionel's control to that of a [...] "caged animal". When she ruins the lives of a mother and her son in season three's [...] "Truth", after exposing the mother as a fugitive from the law, Chloe is forced to look deeper into her own self. Mack believes that this event was a turning point for Chloe's maturity; it is the moment that she realizes that <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> line she should never cross. After it is revealed to Clark in the season five premiere that Chloe knows his secret, the character becomes a larger part of the storyline for the show. Knowing Clark's secret allowed Chloe to finally come to terms with her feelings for Clark, and recognize where their relationship will always be; Chloe's acceptance of her place in Clark's life provides a means for the two to have a more meaningful friendship, without the concerns of Chloe's unrequited love. According to Mack, Chloe has learned to evolve her love for Clark into something more [...] "genuine" [...] and [...] "selfless".|$|E
