50|$|Piquindone (Ro 22-1319) is an {{atypical}} antipsychotic with a tricyclic {{structure that}} {{was developed in the}} 1980s but was never marketed. It acts as a selective D2 receptor antagonist, though based on its effects profile its selectivity may be considered controversial. Unlike most other D2 receptor ligands, piquindone displays Na2+-dependent binding, a property it shares with <b>tropapride,</b> zetidoline, and metoclopramide.|$|E
40|$|Renzapride (I) and <b>Tropapride</b> (IV) {{are very}} similar {{substituted}} benzamides but are distinguishable by their pharmacological profile: the former is a potent 5 HT(3) antagonist while {{the latter is a}} very active D- 2 antidopaminergic drug. A combination of experimental methods (X-ray diffraction and H- 1 NMR spectroscopy) and theoretical calculations (semiempirical molecular orbital AM 1) were used to investigate the conformational space of three 5 HT(3) antagonists: Renzapride (I, BRL 24924), DAU 6215 (II) and Ondansetron (III, GR 38032). The analysis of their solid state conformations as well as their isolated state structures allows us to propose a 5 HT(3) pharmacophoric model which is compared to the one previously reported for benzamide D- 2 antagonists, represented by <b>Tropapride</b> (IV) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tropapride,</b> (exo) - 2, 3 -dimethoxy-N-[8 -(phenylmethyl) - 8 - azabicyclo[3. 2. 1]oct- 3 -yl]benzamide hydrochloride, {{has been}} labeled with fluorine- 18 at the 2 - and 4 -positions of its benzylic group. Two {{synthetic}} pathways were investigated: {{the first one}} required the alkylation of the norbenzyl precursor with 2 - or 4 -[18 F]fluorobenzyl bromide (radiochemical yield of 5 % EOB, 180 min); the second method consisted of a reductive amination of norbenzyl <b>tropapride</b> with 2 - or 4 -[18 F]fluorobenzaldehyde (20 % EOB, 110 min). In both cases, the specific activity {{was found to be}} greater than 1 Ci/mumol (EOS). Animal studies in rats showed the percentage of the injected dose localizing in the whole brain to be 0. 6 +/- 0. 09 and 0. 2 +/- 0. 03 at 2 h post injection for the para- and the ortho-[18 F]fluoro analogs of <b>tropapride</b> respectively. Cerebral biodistribution studies showed at 4 h a striatum uptake of 5 +/- 0. 7 % of the injected dose per gram of striatum for the para derivative with a low fixation into the frontal cortex and the cerebellum (% ID/g FC < 0. 4 and % ID/g Cb < 0. 3). The selectivity of 4 -[18 F]fluorotropapride for D 2 dopaminergic sites was demonstrated through blocking experiments with ketanserin, spiperone and halopemide. The saturability was confirmed by the use of variable specific activities. These preliminary results showed that 4 -[18 F]fluorotropapride can be considered as a potent radiopharmaceutical {{for the study of the}} dopaminergic system with PET. Peer reviewe...|$|E
