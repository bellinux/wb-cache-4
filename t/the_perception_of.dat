5|$|The escape {{response}} in gastropods—the perception of stimuli (for example, {{the presence of}} a predator nearby) and a subsequent escape motion—is a frequent target of behavioural studies. In gastropods, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> environmental chemical stimuli originating, for example, from food or other organisms is possibly mediated by sensory organs such as the osphradium. In the case of L.canarium, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> a predator can occur through chemoreception or vision (a well-developed sense in strombid gastropods). The presence of a predator can significantly alter the movement pattern of L.canarium, inducing an increase in the frequency of leaps.|$|E

Data were collected from 718 parents and 111 teachers by means of a written survey— School Effectiveness Questionnaire published by The Psychological Corporation (Baldwin, et al., 1998). Three research questions were answered by testing 21 hypotheses. Mean scores, paired-sample t-test, Multiple Analysis of Variances (MANOVA) and descriptive comparative statistics were used. Based on the statistical treatment, the following conclusions appear warranted: (1) Significant differences existed in <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> parents in high-performing schools and <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> parents in low-performing schools with respect to clear and focused mission.

5|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> forms. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E

5|$|Current {{official}} transit {{maps of the}} New York City Subway {{are based}} on a 1979 design by Michael Hertz Associates. The maps are not geographically accurate due to the complexity of the system (i.e. Manhattan being the smallest borough, but having the most services), but they do show major city streets as an aid to navigation.

Earlier diagrams of the subway (the first being produced in 1958), while being more aesthetically pleasing, had <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> being more geographically inaccurate than the diagrams today. The design of the subway map by Massimo Vignelli, published by the MTA between 1972 and 1979, has become a modern classic but the MTA deemed the map flawed due to its placement of geographical elements.|$|E
