5|$|In 1937, Pat Ryan {{graduated}} {{cum laude}} from USC with a Bachelor of Science degree in merchandising, {{together with a}} certificate to <b>teach</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> high school level, which USC deemed equivalent to a Master's degree. (She was arguably the best-educated First Lady until Hillary Rodham Clinton in 1993.) Pat accepted a position {{as a high school}} teacher in Whittier, California.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 {{the school}} system also sent two African-American men to <b>teach</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> school: Eugene Parker, who coached for thirty years, and Pierre Davis, who left after one year but {{returned}} in 1971 as City College's first African-American principal.|$|E
5|$|After {{getting his}} degree, O'Donnell moved to Chicago, where he {{expected}} {{that he would}} <b>teach</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> American Conservatory of Music. The job fell through, and instead {{he worked as a}} grip in the film and television business. O'Donnell began his musical career in the field after one of his colleagues who knew of his music background approached him to write for his film. O'Donnell talked to his friend Michael Salvatori, who had his own recording studio, and offered to split the profits from the job with him; the two became constant partners.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1850s, Cowles's {{attention}} turned {{to higher education}} for women teachers. After briefly <b>teaching</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> McNeely Normal School in Hopedale, Ohio, she began <b>teaching</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Illinois State Normal School in 1857.|$|R
50|$|Goldin-Meadow {{has also}} {{received}} a number of <b>teaching</b> awards, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> undergraduate level (Llewellyn John and Harriet Manchester Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate <b>Teaching</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Chicago) and the graduate level (Burlington Northern Faculty Achievement Award for Graduate <b>Teaching</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Chicago), and has {{also received a}} Mentor Award from the American Psychological Association (Division 7).|$|R
5|$|From August 1918 to January 1919, Smith was {{assigned}} to Gosport Instructor's School in San Antonio, Texas, as an Army flight instructor. Later he was then transferred to Rockwell Field in San Diego to <b>teach</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Pursuit School of Instruction, where he remained until he was discharged in March 1919. Subsequently, Smith flew as a barnstormer {{for about a year}} at carnivals. He also gave five-minute rides, for five dollars each, at county fairs in various states during this time. Eventually he destroyed his plane and discontinued these ventures.|$|E
5|$|In 1837 Bennett {{began to}} <b>teach</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> RAM, {{with which he}} was {{associated}} {{for most of the}} rest of his life. For twenty years he taught there, later also teaching at Queen's College, London. Amongst his pupils during this period were Arthur Sullivan, Hubert Parry, and Tobias Matthay. Throughout the 1840s and 1850s he composed little, although he performed as a pianist and directed the Philharmonic Society for ten years. He also actively promoted concerts of chamber music. From 1848 onwards his career was punctuated by antagonism between himself and the conductor Michael Costa.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 Wu {{graduated}} {{at the top}} of her class, and {{was admitted}} to the National Central University in Nanjing. According to the governmental regulations of the time, teacher-training college students wanting to move on to the universities needed to serve as schoolteachers for one year. In Wu's case, this was only nominally enforced. She went to <b>teach</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Public School in Shanghai, the president of which at the time was the philosopher Hu Shih, whose class she took.|$|E
50|$|While {{she found}} <b>teaching</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> schools {{sometimes}} difficult, she enjoyed <b>teaching</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University and her lectures were models of clarity, usually delivered without any notes. She spoke with authority, {{but she did}} not mind questions, and allowed time for discussions.|$|R

5|$|In March 978, King Edward {{was assassinated}} at Corfe Castle, {{possibly}} at the instigation of his stepmother, and Ã†thelred the Unready became king. His coronation on Low Sunday 31 March 978, {{was the last}} state event in which Dunstan took part. When the young king took the usual oath to govern well, Dunstan addressed him in solemn warning. He criticised the violent act whereby he became king and prophesied the misfortunes that were shortly to fall on the kingdom, but Dunstan's influence at court was ended. Dunstan retired to Canterbury, to <b>teach</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cathedral school.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to those born in Malvern, notable people came to the town to be cured (mentioned above), to be educated or <b>teach</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> many independent schools: see articles on Malvern College, Malvern St James, the merger of St. James School and Malvern College for Girls, and Malvern College Prep. (The Downs), or to work at TRE, RRDE, their merger RRE and its successor organisations leading (as of 2011) to QinetiQ, The Hills have inspired poets and novelists.|$|E
5|$|St Mary's Church, Llanfair Mathafarn Eithaf {{is a small}} medieval {{church in}} Anglesey, north Wales. The {{earliest}} parts of the building, including the nave and the north doorway, date from the 14th century. Other parts, including the chancel and the east window, date from the 15th century. It {{is associated with the}} Welsh poet and clergyman Goronwy Owen, who was born nearby and served as curate here.

5|$|After twenty years, {{she left}} ABT in 1991 {{and joined the}} Nederlands Dans Theater III. The same year, van Hamel, McKenzie, Gregory Cary, and Bentley Roton founded the Kaatsbaan International Dance Center as a {{facility}} to host national and international artists. There van Hamel has been the Program Director of Extreme Ballet, a three-week intensive training program, {{since its inception in}} 1991. In 1992, Washington College presented her with the Award for Excellence for her contributions in the arts. Van Hamel left Nederlands Dans Theater III in 1997 and worked as choreographer and director. She returned to ABT in 2004 to <b>teach</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School and to occasionally perform character roles with the professional dance company. She joined the faculty at the Juilliard School in the same year.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a wealthy}} family, whose forebears had been {{involved}} in ensuring Argentina's independence from Spain, she was not expected to work outside the home. Yet Ferrari not only chose to have a career, she insisted on participating in the male-dominated medical profession. She first earned a teaching diploma and became a school teacher, then graduated in medicine in 1911. After completing her residency, she applied to <b>teach</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> university level, but instead was offered a teaching post at the School of Midwifery. Outraged, she fought for 13 years against the prejudices which prevented her advancing in her career. In 1927, Ferrari won her fight and was granted a professorship as an alternate. Finally in 1939, she was awarded a full professorship.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her work at Hull House, Smith was involved in public education. Francis Wayland Parker invited her to head the vocal music department at the Chicago Normal School in 1897 and she was asked by John Dewey to <b>teach</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Chicago {{as the head of}} the Department of Music, School of Education from 1901 to 1910. She not only trained teachers for Dewey but assisted him in developing a revised curriculum for the music education program. Smith also instructed courses at the Chicago Kindergarten College and at the Froebel Kindergarten College, both training colleges for teachers of very young children.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-twentieth century, {{there were}} {{divisions}} in the Melbourne art scene, which became intertwined with the complex cultural politics of the Cold War era. In the late 1940s, there was a move against modernism in art, and tonalism came into favour. Partly {{as a reaction to}} this development, artist George Bell established an exhibiting group called the Melbourne Contemporary Artists in 1940. Bell was a former war artist and influential member of the Victorian artistic establishment, who after World War II was appointed to <b>teach</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> National Gallery of Victoria's painting school. Influenced by Bell, Stokes was among the artists for whom modernism was a strong influence, and who exhibited with the Melbourne Contemporary Artists. Other members of the group included Russell Drysdale and Sali Herman.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to Ohio, the degree from a prestigious Eastern school made Garfield a man of distinction. He {{returned}} to Hiram to <b>teach</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Institute, and in 1857 was made its president. He did not see education as a field that would realize his full potential. At Williams, he had become more politically aware in the intensely anti-slavery atmosphere of the Massachusetts school, and began to consider politics as a career. In 1858, he married Lucretia; they would have seven children, five of whom survived infancy. Soon after the wedding, he formally entered his name to read law at a Cleveland firm, although he did his studying in Hiram. He {{was admitted to the}} bar in 1861.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{explained}} {{in his memoirs}} that MikhaÃ­l Azanchevsky had taken over that year {{as director of the}} Conservatory, and wanting new blood to freshen up teaching in those subjects, had offered to pay generously for Rimsky-Korsakov's services. Biographer Mikhail Zetlin suggests that Azanchevsky's motives might have been twofold. First, Rimsky-Korsakov was the member of the Five least criticized by its opponents, and inviting him to <b>teach</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Conservatory may have been considered a safe way to show that all serious musicians were welcome there. Second, the offer may have been calculated to expose him to an academic climate in which he would write in a more conservative, Western-based style. Balakirev had opposed academic training in music with tremendous vigor, but encouraged him to accept the post to convince others to join the nationalist musical cause.|$|E

5|$|Schwarzkopf was {{promoted}} to captain in July 1961 and reassigned for Advanced Infantry School at Fort Benning for eight months. He also earned his Master Parachutist Badge in that time. In June 1962, Schwarzkopf enrolled at the University of Southern California in a Master of Science in Engineering course studying missile mechanics. He graduated in June 1964, having earned a Master of Science in mechanical and aerospace engineering. He then returned to West Point {{to serve as an}} instructor in the Department of Mechanics. He was originally intended to <b>teach</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Military Academy for three years, but after his first year he volunteered for service in South Vietnam because he thought that career advancement could be most quickly earned in combat. West Point approved his request in early 1965 with the stipulation that he return and teach the remaining two years after his tour.|$|E
5|$|This {{challenge}} and {{the myth of}} the White Stag inspired BÃ¡nÃ¡thy. During World War II, he was a junior officer in the Royal Hungarian Army. After being seriously wounded during combat in Russia, through the connections he made at the World Jamboree, he was invited by General Farkas to join the faculty of the Hungarian Royal Academy. While there he served on the National Council of the Hungarian Scout Association and became the voluntary national director for youth leadership development. Barely escaping Soviet capture (and likely execution) at the end of World War II, BÃ¡nÃ¡thy reached the United States in June 1951. He had been hired to <b>teach</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Army Language School at Monterey, California. There he became reacquainted with Joe Szentkiralyi, whom he had met at the Fourth World Jamboree.|$|E
5|$|While the {{government}} brought in foreign experts (yatoi) during {{the building of}} the country's modern infrastructure, the high seismicity in Japan proved to be an ideal laboratory setting during the establishment of the new science of seismology. In 1876, John Milne came from England to <b>teach</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Imperial College of Engineering in Tokyo. Following the earthquake of February 22, 1880, Milne's attention turned to seismology as a primary area of study. That earthquake also triggered the formation of the Seismological Society of Japan, which was an organization to help foreign scientists stay coordinated in their efforts. Shortly thereafter, the Japanese had their own organization (the Japan Meteorological Agency) that had taken control of an earthquake reporting system that was initially created by Milne. Ultimately, the system and the 1891 earthquake provided data by which seismologist Fusakichi Omori developed a law of decay for aftershocks.|$|E
