40|$|The {{pathogens}} in urine {{specimens of}} 90 pediatric patients with {{urinary tract infection}} were isolated and their resistance to antibiotics in antibiogram determined. The most common pathogen {{was found to be}} E coli (In 77. 7 % of specimens). The most effective antibiotics were i. v amikacin (Sensitivity in 91. 5 % of cases) and oral nalidixic acid (In 76. 9 % of specimens) whereas ampicillin was the most ineffective antibiotic (Resistance in 87. 5 % of specimens). Therapy in urinary tract infections is commonly started with ampicillin and gentamicin. Considering that 39. 5 % of pathogens isolated in our study were resistant <b>to</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>thee</b> antibiotics, preparation <b>of</b> antibiograms to find the most effective antibacterial in all cases of urinary tract infection is highly recommended...|$|R

6000|$|That evening Ayesha was {{disturbed}} and ill at ease, as though new fears {{which she could}} not overcome assailed her. At length she seemed to conquer them by some effort of her will and announced that she was minded to sleep and thus refresh her soul; {{the only part of}} her, I think, which ever needed rest. Her last words to us were--"Sleep you also, sleep sound, but be not astonished, my Leo, if I send <b>to</b> summon <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> during the night, since in my slumbers I may find new counsels and need to speak <b>of</b> them to <b>thee</b> ere we break camp at dawn." ...|$|R

'You will wonder, perhaps,' {{she said}} in a {{stronger}} tone, 'that I can better bear to be known to you whom I have wronged, than to the son of my enemy who wronged me.--For she did wrong me! She not only sinned grievously against the Lord, but she wronged me. What Arthur's father was to me, she made him. From our marriage day I was his dread, and that she made me. I was the scourge of both, and that is referable to her. You love Arthur (I can see the blush upon your face; may it be the dawn of happier days <b>to</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you!),</b> and you will have thought already that he is as merciful and kind as you, and why do I not trust myself to him as soon as to you.

As a {{last hope}} Jane Finn {{was to be}} allowed to escape--and the escape must be managed so that she {{harbours}} no suspicions of its being a put-up job. They're not averse to young Beresford's being in the neighbourhood, and, if necessary, communicating with you. They'll take care {{to get him out of}} the way at the right minute. Then Julius Hersheimmer dashes up and rescues you in true melodramatic style. Bullets fly--but don't hit anybody. What would have happened next? You would have driven straight to the house in Soho and secured the document which Miss Finn would probably have entrusted to her cousin's keeping. Or, if he conducted the search, he would have pretended to find the hiding-place already rifled. He would have had a dozen ways of dealing with the situation, but the result would have been the same. And I rather fancy some accident would have happened <b>to</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> You see, you know rather an inconvenient amount. That's a rough outline. I admit I was caught napping; but somebody else wasn't." ...|$|E
5000|$|Any {{university}} {{teacher has}} {{to manage the}} transition from school to university {{for his or her}} students. A first-year undergraduate in 1963, Geoffrey Thomas (later of the Philosophy department, Birkbeck College, London) recalls his naive bewilderment at a clash between authorities. Professor H. R. G. Greaves promoted one view of cabinet collective responsibility in his lectures, and Dr Crick quite another in his classes. [...] "You might be interested to know," [...] Thomas innocently remarked with some bafflement in a tutorial, [...] "that your views on collective responsiibity are polar opposite to those of Professor Greaves". [...] "Then," [...] Crick urbanely observed, [...] "having equal access <b>to</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us <b>you</b> are in a position of unique advantage." [...] A student learnt one difference between school and university that afternoon.|$|R

I have been expecting <b>to</b> see you <b>both</b> at this palace. You have appeared in the material world as My incarnations in order to minimize the force of the demoniac persons who burden the world. Now after killing all these unwanted demons, you will please again come back <b>to</b> Me. <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> are incarnations <b>of</b> the great sage Nara-Narayana. Although you are both complete in yourselves, to protect the devotees and to annihilate the demons and especially to establish religious principles in the world so that peace and tranquillity may continue, you are teaching the basic principles of factual religion so that the people of the world may follow you and thereby be peaceful and prosperous."2 ...|$|R

I told her that, of course, I should never allude {{to the matter}} again, {{and that she was}} not to trouble about it in the slightest, for that I had put her down for five thousand pounds in my will and would change the figure to four, so that she would only be getting the money a little earlier than I had intended. This evening, unfortunately, I was stupid enough, in saying that I was pleased to see her looking more like her old self, to add that I was glad to know that I had been the means of helping my little favourite out of a scrape. It was stupid of me, I admit, to have even thus far broken my promise never to allude to the thing again, but why she should have insisted upon my telling a story--painful <b>to</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us--to <b>you,</b> is altogether beyond my comprehension.' ...|$|R
