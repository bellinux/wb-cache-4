5|$|Communication to <b>the</b> <b>Riviera</b> Maya {{area was}} {{difficult}} after the storm; not all cellular phones were receiving coverage to the area, land lines were down, and electricity was out. About 18,000people in 20 low-lying {{communities in the}} state of Tamaulipas, just south of the U.S.-Mexican border, were evacuated. Including losses sustained by the oil industry, damage in Mexico amounted to 8.87billion pesos ($834.3million).|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Hunter {{began to}} make a series of trips to {{mainland}} Europe, where he visited Paris, Venice, Florence and <b>the</b> <b>Riviera.</b> Fergusson accompanied him {{on a number of}} these visits. Hunter's visits abroad produced a large number of paintings and his style changed noticeably in this period of European travel as he began using dabs of colour placed instinctively to portray underlying form.|$|E
5|$|In later life, he and {{his wife}} took to {{travelling}} to <b>the</b> <b>Riviera,</b> Florence or Mentone each year for him to relax and recuperate. It was on such a visit to Verona, Italy that on Palm Sunday, 31 March 1901 he felt unwell and retired to his room. Later that afternoon he died of a heart attack. He was sixty. His body was taken back to England, and his funeral service was held on 6 April at St Cross Church, Oxford with a large number of friends and colleagues present, followed by burial in adjacent Holywell Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|On 15 November 2004, Shaftesbury's Nice-based lawyer, Thierry Bensaude {{reported}} him missing, {{after being}} contacted by his girlfriend, Orche. The peer divided {{his time between}} <b>the</b> <b>Riviera</b> and a home in Hove, East Sussex. He had been due to return home on 10 November. After not hearing from Shaftesbury in a week, they remained concerned when he failed {{to return to his}} rented flat in Adelaide Crescent, Hove. Bensaude and Orche both expressed fears for his safety. Shaftesbury had been taking legal action in relation to the theft of some family antiques and artwork. Some friends and acquaintances mentioned that he had complained of money problems, so they surmised that his disappearance may {{have had something to do}} with the theft and financial loss.|$|E
5|$|The 10th Earl of Shaftesbury {{became a}} {{familiar}} figure {{in some of the}} nightspots on the French Riviera. He was known for his black leather trousers, pink shirts, and large red and black eyeglasses. He had a habit of flashing his money around as he bought drinks {{for a wide variety of}} female companions. At one such establishment on <b>the</b> <b>Riviera,</b> he met Jamila Ben M'Barek (born c. 1961), a divorcée and the mother of two children from a previous relationship. She was one of seven children born in Paris to a Tunisian mother and Moroccan father. In 1993, M'Barek had posed naked in Playboy, but it did not cause alarm. They were married on 5 November 2002, at Hilversum in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, tens of {{thousands}} of tourists and residents were evacuated from the beach resorts in and around Cancún, <b>the</b> <b>Riviera</b> Maya, and Cozumel. Hotel guests were evacuated on Saturday afternoon, and staff on Sunday afternoon. Though some hotel guests in second floor rooms and above were given the option to be bussed into the center of Cancun to safe houses and shelters or to stay and wait out the storm in only the modern built hotels and resorts. Most of the remaining guests were restricted to their rooms and were not allowed out on the beach areas. No alcohol was sold in Cancun for 36hours prior to the arrival of the storm, in an attempt to avoid drunken tourists being injured during the night. Two helicopter pilots were killed when their aircraft crashed while evacuating offshore oil platforms operated by Pemex. A German resident was electrocuted while on his roof in Playa del Carmen.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the fame of <b>the</b> Ligurian <b>rivieras,</b> <b>the</b> term came into English to refer to any shoreline, {{especially}} one that is sunny, topographically diverse and popular with tourists.

25|$|In {{the middle}} of the 1955 model year, Buick and Oldsmobile {{introduced}} the world's first mass-produced four-door hardtops, with Buick offering it only on the Century and Special models, and <b>the</b> <b>Riviera</b> designation was also applied to these body styles.

5000|$|Riviera is an Italian {{word for}} [...] "shoreline", {{ultimately}} derived from Latin ripa ("riverbank").

Now it is divided into <b>the</b> Italian <b>Riviera</b> and <b>the</b> French <b>Riviera,</b> although <b>the</b> French use the term [...] "Riviera" [...] to refer to <b>the</b> Italian <b>Riviera</b> and call <b>the</b> French portion the [...] "Côte d'Azur".|$|R

5000|$|Campus Party {{is second}} and final studio album by the American rock band <b>the</b> <b>Rivieras</b> {{released}} in 1965 through Riviera Records.
