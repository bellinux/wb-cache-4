5|$|Bartholomew meets Jeremy and Alysa {{at the top}} of the mountain, and {{informs the}} pair that the vampires have already summoned a {{powerful}} demon that will slaughter mankind. Bartholomew has called upon the army of Rome, led by the powerful First Paladin of Rome, to defeat the demon. Jeremy, knowing that the First Paladin of Rome would kill him and Alysa on sight, sets off to defeat the demon before the army of Rome arrives. When Jeremy and Alysa confront the demon, it explains that it was summoned because the humans have become too numerous, and with increased numbers <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> from fearing vampires to hunting them. Jeremy and Alysa kill the demon and Bartholomew recovers the Blood Seal. As he does this, the First Paladin of Rome arrives and demands the seal for himself. Bartholomew gives the seal to Jeremy instead, and battles the Paladin to delay the army of Rome.|$|E

25|$|Gene {{had sent}} us a phoney press release and press packet. Listing all the places they had been playing and 'Reviews' of their performances. All were bogus. I {{remember}} laughing and telling Bill, 'If <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to this extent to get our attention, let's go see them.' And we did.|$|E
25|$|During this decade, Australia's {{dominance}} {{has continued}} {{to the point that}} <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> months sometimes even a full calendar year without losing a single match and have racked up many records along the way. Following Steve Waugh's omission in 2002 from One Day International cricket and, in his retirement in 2004 from Test cricket, Ricky Ponting replaced him as Captain and continued the team's international dominance.|$|E

25|$|The unsized {{oat groats}} {{pass through a}} heat and {{moisture}} treatment to balance moisture, but mainly to stabilize them. Oat groats are high in fat (lipids) and once removed from their protective hulls and exposed to air, enzymatic (lipase) activity begins {{to break down the}} fat into free fatty acids, ultimately causing an off-flavour or rancidity. Oats begin to show signs of enzymatic rancidity within four days of being dehulled if not stabilized. This process is primarily done in food-grade plants, not in feed-grade plants. Groats are not considered raw if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> through this process; the heat disrupts the germ and they cannot sprout.|$|E
60|$|Both boats had disappeared, {{and nothing}} {{save a few}} {{fragments}} showed where <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> down.|$|R

25|$|UFO are an English {{rock band}} that {{was formed in}} London in 1969. They became a {{transitional}} group between early hard rock and heavy metal and {{the new wave of}} British heavy metal. The band's current lineup includes vocalist Phil Mogg, lead guitarist Vinnie Moore, bass guitarist Rob De Luca, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Paul Raymond and drummer Andy Parker. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> through several line-up changes, leaving Mogg as the only constant member, and had two hiatuses (1983–1984 and again from 1989 to 1991). The band are also notable for featuring former Scorpions guitarist and MSG founder Michael Schenker, {{who was a member of}} UFO from 1973 to 1978 and again, occasionally, between 1993 and 2003, when Moore replaced him.|$|E
25|$|The Rugby World Cup is {{considered}} the ultimate rugby competition. The New Zealand All Blacks won the first world cup in 1987, beating France in the final. Since then the All Blacks were favourites on several occasions, but did not win for another 24 years. New Zealand lost to Australia in the semi-final in 2003 {{and fell to the}} French team in the quarter-final of the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Intense lobbying by the NZRFU and the New Zealand Government helped New Zealand secure hosting rights to the 2011 Rugby World Cup. The All Blacks regained the World Cup on home soil in 2011. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> on to be the first country in history to win the Rugby World Cup two times consecutively, as they won the 2015 competition in England.|$|E
25|$|The next day, Mistyfoot rushes into ThunderClan {{camp and}} says that Mudclaw and Hawkfrost have been meeting at night. She then says that Hawkfrost and a patrol went out at dawn that day and had not returned, and she {{suspects}} that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to attack Onewhisker's followers in WindClan. Firestar assembles a patrol to accompany him to fight, and sure enough, a battle starts on WindClan territory. Leafpool is left behind {{with a couple of}} other ThunderClan warriors in the camp. Two ShadowClan warriors invade and almost kill Leafpool when Crowfeather comes to her rescue. Crowfeather confesses he loves her, and she realizes she loves him too. During the battle, Brambleclaw fights Mudclaw. Although Mudclaw has the advantage over Brambleclaw, Hawkfrost saves Brambleclaw. Mudclaw claims that he and Hawkfrost had an agreement: Mudclaw would take over and make Hawkfrost the deputy, despite the fact that Hawkfrost is from RiverClan. Hawkfrost denies this when lightning suddenly strikes a tree, crushing Mudclaw and making a bridge to an island, making it the new Gathering place.|$|E

25|$|Having faked her own death, Gavin's wife, Kathy Sullivan (Gillian Taylforth), makes {{plans to}} escape Gavin and asks Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) for money on several occasions, saying she {{is willing to}} go to prison so she can {{eventually}} reunite with her family in Walford. Kathy and Phil arrange to meet at St Pancras International, but she cannot meet him because her son, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), is there. As she leaves, Gavin surprises her, revealing he knows what she has planned. After Kathy makes attempts to contact someone at The Queen Victoria pub, Gavin arrives on Albert Square. He texts Phil, pretending to be Kathy, and meets him, revealing that after St Pancras, he and Kathy planned to fly themselves to Spain but Kathy escaped by crashing the car. Phil discovers that Kathy is staying in a guest house in Kent, but Gavin follows Phil there and finds Kathy first. Phil realises <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to a local airfield, so he stops them from leaving and convinces Kathy to go back with him, leaving Gavin behind. When Phil meets Kathy at her hotel room, she agrees with him {{that there should be no}} more contact between them. After Phil leaves, it is revealed that Gavin has manipulated her into saying this. Phil goes missing after Gavin and two men confront him at his garage. After Kathy's sons, Ian and Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid), discover she is alive, Gavin finds Kathy in Walford. He tells Kathy to stick to their plan and Phil will stay alive. When Kathy reunites with Ben, Kathy says that she needs all of Phil's money or Gavin will kill him, and Gavin later tells Kathy he will harm Ian and Ben if she does not get the money that night. Kathy decides to go to the police to confess to fraud and to report Phil's kidnapping. When Ian finds out, he calls Gavin, saying he knows what Gavin has done, but Gavin now knows that Kathy has not stuck to their plan. Kathy realises Gavin probably has Phil at his sister's house, but when they get there, Gavin and Phil are gone, but Phil's blood is found. Phil, a recovering alcoholic, gets back home but is covered in cuts and bruises and has broken bones, and reveals to Ben that Gavin deliberately got him drinking alcohol again.|$|E

500|$|This was {{followed}} by circulation of pornographic cartoons, which depicted Rasputin having relations with the Empress, her four daughters and Anna Vyrubova. After the scandal, Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg for a time, much to Alexandra's displeasure, and Rasputin went {{on a pilgrimage to}} Palestine. Despite the rumors, the imperial family's association with Rasputin continued until his murder on December 17, 1916. [...] "Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> through heavy 'courses' for their age and their souls have much developed", Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on December 6, 1916.|$|E

During work, Michael drinks a combination of scotch and Splenda, an artificial sweetener; Michael had the same drink in the third season episode [...] "Cocktails". Michael tries {{to get a job}} with Prince Family Paper Company only to find <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> out of business; this is a reference to [...] "Prince Family Paper", an episode from earlier in the fifth season, in which Michael and Dwight go undercover at Prince Paper to learn their company secrets and steal their clients. While flirting with Charles, Kelly said her family was so close they were like the Kardashians, a reference to the E! reality series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians.|$|E
500|$|In the Pāli Canon, {{an enlightened}} person {{is said to}} be neutral in terms of karma, that is, the person no longer generates karma, merit, or demerit. Some {{scholars}} have interpreted this to mean that an enlightened person attains a state where distinctions between good and evil no longer exist. Other scholars have criticized this as making little sense, considering how the Buddha would normally emphasize ethics. The fact that an enlightened person is neutral in terms of karma, does not mean he is [...] neutral. Indeed, the Buddha is quoted in the Tipiṭaka as saying he is foremost in 'higher morality' (adhisīla). Keown attempts to overcome this problem by proposing that enlightened people are beyond the accumulative experience of good deeds (merit, puñña), since they are already perfected. They therefore do not need to accumulate goodness and the resulting happiness anymore. They no longer need to strive for a happy rebirth in the next life, because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> beyond rebirth. Their enlightenment is, however, an [...] perfection as well, though this is solely described as kusala, not as puñña.|$|E
500|$|The zduhaći, {{the dragon}} men, {{and the related}} folkloric figures of Europe can be {{compared}} with Eurasian shamans, e.g., the noaidi of the Lapps, {{as well as the}} shamans of the Samoyeds and Tungus in Siberia. They were all able to leave their body in spirit to fight against the enemies of their community. The shamans also fought against each other, usually in animal form, for reasons such as to procure for their side as much reindeer as possible. However, for a shaman's soul to leave his body, he had to work himself into a state of ecstasy through a ceremony consisting of drumming, dancing, chanting, and even taking narcotics. All the zduhaći had to do was to fall asleep, although the unusual depth of their sleep indicates a state of ecstasy. There are detailed and eventful descriptions of the journey of the shaman's soul, but no corresponding accounts exist {{in the case of the}} zduhaći. However, the zduhaći who left their bodies were said to have gone into the winds. This expression may contain an idea of a journey. Pavel Rovinski recorded the words he heard from his landlady in Montenegro on a windy night in March: [...] "Listen, how they sing—the travellers; <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> high high! Happy journey to them!" ...|$|E
