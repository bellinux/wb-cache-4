The band began writing songs for the new album while touring, and intended to quickly make a new album {{in order to keep}} momentum in the wake of their breakthrough success. Vocalist Patrick Stump stated that he wished to begin working on the record earlier, but the group's management urged the members <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>off</b> to recuperate from their constant touring schedule.|$|E

In 1938, he received a Worcester Reed Warner Medal in recognition of his technical writing.|$|E
5|$|When Orton {{was well}} enough to wrestle, Punk demanded a match with him, which he won via {{disqualification}} when DiBiase interfered. As a result, Orton punted DiBiase in the head, putting him out of action; this storyline {{was put in place}} in order for DiBiase <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>off</b> to film The Marine 2. Orton then invited Rhodes and Manu to form a group with him called The Legacy, and used them to help in his rivalry with Batista leading to a three-on-two handicap match where Batista was put out of action for four months.|$|E

5|$|During the happenings of the episode, a man playing Santa at a Christmas-themed ranch {{is shown}} videotaping the {{children}} at his ranch. Billie later tells Mulder that she saw a vision of her daughter in her room and that she said the number 74. Mulder decides he cannot finish the case and wants <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>off</b> because he's too close to make any sound judgment. On {{their way to the}} airport, Scully comes across the Santa park (situated off of California State Route 74) and decides to stop because of the reference to Santa Claus in the notes. Here they find the videotape setup and tapes dating {{all the way back to}} the '60s, including one of Amber Lynn LaPierre.

5|$|In January 1980, {{the members}} of TalkingHeads {{returned}} to New York City after the tours in support of their 1979 critically acclaimed third album, Fear of Music, and decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>off</b> to pursue personal interests. Byrne worked with Eno, the record's producer, on an experimental collaboration named My Life in the Bush of Ghosts. Jerry Harrison produced an album for soul singer Nona Hendryx at the Sigma Sound Studios branch in New York City; the singer and the location were later used during the recording of Remain in Light on Harrison's advice. Husband and wife Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth discussed the possibility of leaving the band after the latter suggested that Byrne's level of control was excessive. Frantz was not open {{to the idea of}} ending TalkingHeads, and the two decided to take a long vacation in the Caribbean to ponder the state of the band and their marriage. During the trip, the couple became involved in Haitian Vodou religious ceremonies and practised with several types of native percussion instruments. While in Jamaica they socialised with the famous reggae rhythm section of Sly and Robbie.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for League One football, Adams signed winger Kaid Mohamed {{to replace the}} departing Ashley Vincent. He also signed defenders Chris Robertson and Carl Dickinson, midfielders Chris Lines and Anthony Griffith, and forward Gavin Tomlin. On 22 September, Rob Page was put in temporary charge of first team affairs at Vale Park after Adams took the decision <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>off</b> work to have hip replacement surgery. The club overstretched itself financially, meaning that as they lay outside the play-offs in January Adams could only sign largely untried youngsters on loan whilst releasing higher paid players either on free transfers or on loan. Their promotion push fell away but they ended the season in ninth place – far exceeding their original aim of avoiding relegation. During this time he {{had to deal with}} issues such as sacking defender Daniel Jones for physically attacking captain Doug Loft during training, and had to deal with months of speculation over his own future after chairman Norman Smurthwaite took until May before offering him a new one-year rolling contract. He signed the contract the following month.|$|E

25|$|In England, by the 1890s, {{a long-standing}} Rugby Football Union ban on {{professional}} players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were {{working class and}} could not afford <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>off</b> to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not {{very different from what}} had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in Huddersfield to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport.|$|E

25|$|In late 2006 AAA owner Antonio Peña died, forcing various changes {{backstage}} including Joaquin Roldan {{taking over}} the booking duties. One {{of the things that}} Roldan changed in AAA was that La Parka was no longer booked as the lone top tecnico any more, focusing the main storyline more on Cibernético. On March 18, 2007 La Parka won his fourth and so far final Rey de Reyes tournament defeating Octagón, Abismo Negro, Rhino, Fuerza Guerrera and Latin Lover in the elimination match final. At Triplemania XV the La Legión team of Ron Killings, Sabu, Head Hunter A and Rikishi Phatu defeated La Parka, El Zorro, Latin Lover and Animal. Over the summer of 2007 La Parka injured his shoulder in a car accident, forcing him to work a lighter schedule and a less risky style. At the 2007 Antonio Peña Memorial Show Kenzo Suzuki aggravated La Parka's injury by accident forcing him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>off</b> after the event.|$|E
25|$|At WrestleMania 21, Venis {{competed in}} a 30-man Interpromotional battle royal which was won by Booker T. In {{the summer of}} 2005 he formed another team, V-Squared, with Viscera. While wrestling on Heat, they {{squashed}} {{a number of other}} tag teams including the World Tag Team Champions Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch in a non-title match. On the December 5 episode of Raw, V-Squared participated in a fatal four way match for the World Tag Team Championship, including the champions Big Show and Kane, The Heart Throbs, and Snitsky and Tyson Tomko but were defeated. Venis and Viscera continued to team in 2006, getting another shot at Big Show and Kane's titles, while occasionally having solo matches. In March 2006, Venis suffered a kayfabe injury {{at the hands of the}} Spirit Squad which allowed him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>off</b> for legitimate elbow surgery, during which about a dozen more bone spurs were removed, six others were shaved down, and a nerve was transplanted.|$|E
25|$|On August 9, 1999, Hogan {{started the}} night {{dressed in the}} typical black and white, but after a {{backstage}} scene with his son came out dressed in the traditional red and yellow for his main event six-man tag team match. Hogan then defeated Nash in a retirement match at Road Wild to retain the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Injuries and frustrations were mounting up however, and he was absent from television from October 1999 to February 2000. In his book Hollywood Hulk Hogan, Bollea {{said that he was}} asked <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>off</b> by newly hired head of creative booking Vince Russo and was not told when he would be brought back at the time. Despite some reservations, he agreed to do so. On October 24 at Halloween Havoc, Hogan was to face Sting for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. However, Hogan came to the ring in street clothes, lay down for the pin, and left the ring.|$|E
