The text dedicates 23 verses in the tenth chapter on samadhi (concentration) <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the equality of one's Atman and Brahman (Universal Ultimate Reality, God).|$|E
25|$|Only in {{the decades}} after World War II have the Ainu started <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> {{international}} aboriginal rights movements. Largely due {{to the efforts of}} Shigeru Kayano, the first Ainu member of the Diet of Japan, some schools in Hokkaido have been established to preserve and revive the Ainu culture.|$|E
25|$|Through the {{evolution}} of public sentiments, the victims and environmental protesters were able to acquire standing and proceed more effectively in their cause. The involvement of the press also aided the process of democratization because it caused more people <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the facts of Minamata disease and the pollution that caused it.|$|E
50|$|In the 16th century, {{visitors}} <b>to</b> India <b>became</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> {{similarities between}} Indian and European languages. For example, Filippo Sassetti reported striking resemblances between Sanskrit and Italian.|$|R
60|$|In the meanwhile, however, Mirrab seemed <b>to</b> have <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the {{consequences}} of her vehement confession. Her wandering wits came slowly back to her. Terrified, she looked {{from one to the}} other of the grave faces which were fixed upon her.|$|R

He spoke in low, hurried tones, fearful evidently of being overheard and interrupted.|$|R
25|$|There is no {{provision}} for review or appeal of a grant of a warrant application, only of a denial. That is because in both the FISC and the FISCA, the government - the party who seeks a warrant to conduct surveillance - is the only party before the court, and it is unusual for anyone else <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the warrant application in the first place.|$|E
25|$|High-low pricing {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of offering goods at a high price for a period of time, followed by offering the same goods at a low price for a predetermined time. This practice is widely used by chain stores selling homewares. The main disadvantage of the high-low tactic is that consumers tend <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the price cycles and time their purchases to coincide with a low-price cycle.|$|E
25|$|The preparatory {{teaching}} {{conducted by}} Institute of Pedagogic Cybernetics at the University of Paderborn in Germany prepares students <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the essential characteristics of languages, using {{the international language}} Esperanto as a model, a language with a clear and simple structure, almost completely regular and, thanks to its agglutinative character, detachable into combinable morphological elements; this model is easy to assimilate and develops aptitude {{for the study of}} other languages.|$|E
40|$|The {{article has}} the main {{objective}} {{to define the}} term "political prisoner's wife" to understand the experience and the participation of these women outside the Spanish prisons during the Franquist period. The evolution from the individual solidarity and attendance on imprisoned relative <b>to</b> <b>became</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> a coordinate mobilization to exhibit their claims as wives and as victims of repression is considered along that paper. That evolution allows us to see which was these women's role in favor of amnesty's campaign. In consequence, the article has a final analysis about this women's mobilization's influence over the actual studies on political opposition to the dictatorship. political prisoners' wives, amnesty, jail world, repression, women's mobilization, solidarity...|$|R
30|$|In {{this context}} {{combining}} strong hazard and major vulnerability, {{the local authorities}} only appear <b>to</b> have <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> risk very recently. The town of Leucate therefore provides an interesting site to experiment with the integrated and operational marine submersion risk management approach developed by the CRISSIS program.|$|R

25|$|Rodriguez-Trias {{headed the}} {{department}} of pediatrics at Lincoln Hospital in the South Bronx. At Lincoln Hospital, Rodriguez-Trias lobbied to give all workers a voice in administrative and patient-care issues. She became involved with the Puerto Rican community and encouraged the health care workers at the hospital <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the cultural issues {{and needs of the}} community. Rodriguez-Trias was also an associate professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, and later taught at Columbia and Fordham universities.|$|E
25|$|At first, only African Americans {{were buying}} R discs. According to Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records, sales were {{localized}} in African-American markets; {{there was no}} white sales nor white radio play. During the early 1950s, more white teenagers started <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> R and to purchase the music. For example, 40% of 1952 sales at Dolphin's of Hollywood record shop, located in an African-American area of Los Angeles, were to whites. Eventually, white teens across the country turned their music taste towards rhythm and blues.|$|E
25|$|In hand-to-hand combat, {{the player}} {{has four main}} attacks; high kick, low kick, punch, and grapple. After hitting an enemy {{a certain number of}} times, the enemy will be stunned, at which point the player can perform a combo by {{pressing}} a series of buttons. During stealth missions, the player is automatically placed into stealth mode. The player can approach enemies from behind and either knock them out or kill them. Bumping into objects or walking over broken glass or plastic bags will cause nearby enemies <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the player's presence.|$|E

25|$|This {{brings us}} back to Wittgenstein's {{reliance}} on indirect communication, and his reliance on thought-experiments. Some philosophical confusions come about because we aren't able to see family resemblances. We've made a mistake in understanding the vague and intuitive rules that language uses, and have thereby tied ourselves up in philosophical knots. He suggests that an attempt to untangle these knots requires more than simple deductive arguments pointing out the problems with some particular position. Instead, Wittgenstein's larger goal is to try to divert us from our philosophical problems long enough <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> our intuitive ability to see the family resemblances.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the first}} local ruler <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the {{impending}} Ottoman threat, Momchil unsuccessfully pleaded with the emperors of Bulgaria and Byzantium for help. Even though his troops continued the {{resistance in the}} Eastern Rhodopes, in May 1345 the Turks led by Umur Beg marched from Asia Minor and devastated Bulgarian territories driving away people and livestock. Soon after, on 7 July 1345, Ottoman forces under Umur Beg defeated Momchil's army {{in the battle of}} Peritor near his capital Xanthi. Sources attest that the independent ruler perished in the battle without leaving asuccessor, and with little political will or leadership left to counter the Ottoman invasion.|$|E
25|$|During reincarnation {{consciousness}} {{tries to}} liberate {{itself from the}} burden of collected impressions. Yet, since it tries to achieve this by associating itself with impressions opposite from the previously accumulated ones, it gets further entangled in accumulating fresh impressions. Thus the soul experiences itself in a seemingly endless succession of human lives, as {{a man or a}} woman, as rich or poor, strong or weak, beautiful or ugly, black or white, in various places, religions, castes etc. It is only after numerous apparent births and deaths, that the range of human experience starts to get exhausted. In this way the soul starts dissociating itself from the gross world, enabling its consciousness <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the subtle sphere.|$|E

50|$|Popular {{education}} {{may be defined}} as an educational technique designed to raise the consciousness of its participants and allow them <b>to</b> <b>become</b> more <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> how an individual's personal experiences are connected to larger societal problems.

5000|$|Critics {{have raised}} {{objections}} to the FDA's approval of cloned-animal products for human consumption, arguing that the FDA's research was inadequate, inappropriately limited, and of questionable scientific validity. [...] Several consumer-advocate groups are working to encourage a tracking program that would allow consumers <b>to</b> <b>become</b> more <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> cloned-animal products within their food.|$|R
25|$|A bank {{might be}} {{interested}} in minimizing the amount of money it borrows overnight from a central bank. Interbank transfers must be communicated and arranged through automation by a set time each business day. The failure of any vital communication could cost the bank large sums in interest charged by the central bank. A BAM solution would be programmed <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> each message and await confirmation. Failure to receive confirmation within a reasonable amount of time would be grounds for the BAM solution to raise an alarm that would set in motion manual intervention to investigate the cause of the delay and to push the problem toward resolution before it becomes costly.|$|E
25|$|Charles {{approached}} stuttering {{from the}} viewpoint that the stutterer should scrutinize his stuttering behavior, <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> everything he did from anticipation of stuttering, to struggling during a block, and to the utterance of the word. A speech-language clinician using his methodology was {{to explain to her}} client the nature of the many attitudes and behaviors of stutterers. Wendell Johnson, a member of the same graduate program in Iowa who also became renowned for his work in the field of stuttering, said that Charles Van Riper's methodology was hard work. As a clinician, Charles was known for being warm and sympathetic, but tough on adult stutterers who refused to work and cooperate with him, since they were expected to be able and willing to practice behaviors and attitudes that would minimize their stuttering.|$|E
500|$|Christian {{meditation}} {{is a form}} {{of prayer}} in which a structured attempt is made <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> and reflect upon the revelations of God. The word meditation comes from the Latin word meditārī, which has a range of meanings including to reflect on, to study and to practice. Christian meditation is the process of deliberately focusing on specific thoughts (such as a bible passage) and reflecting on their meaning {{in the context of the}} love of God.|$|E

25|$|Positive priming {{is thought}} to be caused by {{spreading}} activation. This means that the first stimulus activates parts of a particular representation or association in memory just before carrying out an action or task. The representation is already partially activated when the second stimulus is encountered, so less additional activation is needed for one <b>to</b> <b>become</b> consciously <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|R
500|$|One raging {{public debate}} {{involving}} language went unmentioned in The Language Instinct: the [...] "reading wars," [...] or dispute over whether {{children should be}} explicitly taught to read by decoding the sounds of words from their spelling (loosely known as [...] "phonics") or whether they can develop it instinctively by being immersed in a text-rich environment (often called [...] "whole language"). I tipped my hand in the paragraph in [...] which said that language is an instinct but reading is not. Like most psycholinguists (but apparently unlike many school boards), I think it's essential for children to be taught <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> speech sounds {{and how they are}} coded in strings of letters.|$|E

[...] Paraguay's chief engineer the talented William Keld Whytehead cannot have failed <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the advantages of ironclad vessels and it is on record that in 1863 he obtained a British patent for an iron-cladded vessel.
