40|$|Compared to {{conventional}} forming joining technics, e. q. mechanical crimping, the magnetic pulse crimping gives advantages {{because of a}} contact-free tooling, a symmetrical coaxial pressure and forming, {{as well as a}} low spring back after forming. Limitations of the general functionality <b>of</b> <b>crimp</b> <b>joints</b> also obtain for magnetic pulsed crimp joints: Leak-tightness, combined with corrosion resistance, and a partially Limitation of electrical conductivity (transition resistance). To improve and to extend the functionality of MP-crimp-joints different filler materials can be used.

The Design of Experiments method was used to optimise the shape and dimensions of the internal workpieces with a double groove design.

Based on these observations an optimal double groove joint design was proposed. The deformation and failure behaviour <b>of</b> the <b>crimp</b> <b>joints</b> during tensile testing were experimentally studied using the digital image correlation technique.

40|$|Over {{its history}} {{electromagnetic}} forming (EMF) has probably seen {{far and away}} more application in assembling tubes or rings onto (or into) nominally axisymmetric mating elements. The vast majority of these assemblies does not require any significant structural integrity or strength. However, {{a small fraction of}} these are designed and fabricated for mechanically-demanding applications. There are two key factors (which seem to be largely independent) that are key in the design and performance of a crimpedelectromagnetic tube joint. First is the state of residual stress that exists after the <b>crimped</b> <b>joint</b> is created. A natural interference fit seems to be a fairly general feature <b>of</b> EMF <b>crimp</b> <b>joints.</b> This interference gives a backlash-free joint that will not fret. The second key issue is the configuration of the joint. The fabrication of designed interlocking geometries is required to create a joint that maximizes mechanical strength while minimizing the electromagnetic energy and forces required to create it. Both of these issues will be considered here. Here we consider crimping onto textured surfaces such as screw threads and knurls. We show experimentally that approaches of this type can give joints that exceed the strength of the tube both in torsion and axial loading. Analysis methods based on coupling impact-indentation and break-before-strip criteria can be used to compare joints made in this way with those based on the more traditional large scale deformation of the tube. One of the advantages of forming onto 'textured' surfaces is that a number of small pulses (possibly generated by small and inexpensive capacitor banks) can be used to create a joint that has the strength of the parent tube, without any heat affected zones or distortion. Again, the natural interference fit developed by impact eliminates the potential for fretting...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of a novel technical solution that is aimed to improve the quality <b>of</b> cable <b>crimp</b> terminations in the electronics industry. The automotive, aero and military vehicle industries are of special interest due to their stringent requirements for guaranteed quality assurances in relation to their safety-critical products. The emphasis is on handheld crimping tools, where a new scheme for measuring the relevant crimp force is proposed using a small embedded computer to process information; so as to make an on-instrument statement regarding the crimp process quality. The thesis includes a detailed review of the current technical practices in the cable termination business, with a particular emphasis on the quality estimations for crimped connections using the crimp force monitoring (CFM) scheme. A comprehensive study <b>of</b> the state-of-the-art <b>crimp</b> force monitoring schemes and technologies is presented. A gap in the tool chain is identified whereby the industry has a preference for the use of hand tools in some selected processes; but the CFM scheme cannot be currently integrated directly with such hand tools. The bulk of the work in this thesis is thus focused on the development of a technical solution that will address this need for integration of hand tools with the CFM scheme. The concept is to develop a fully embedded subsystem that can be attached directly to a hand tool and this system will perform all of the signal processing and the statistical analysis so that each <b>crimped</b> <b>joint</b> can be trusted to meet the relevant stated quality parameters. In the course of development work a fully functional prototype subsystem is developed for the CFM solution, for application to hand tools. Analytical and statistical measurement and assessment algorithms were developed to a standard, which allows a final quality rating to be applied to <b>crimped</b> <b>joint</b> connections. Such algorithms are designed to be embedded directly onto the instrument’s microcomputer. The new system has been evaluated and tested {{in the course of this}} research project and it has currently been accepted by a number of industries for a planned volume qualification assessment...|$|R
50|$|After {{the strap}} is tensioned, the strap is often sealed to itself. Steel strap is sealed with a seal and notch joint, a seal and <b>crimp,</b> seal-less <b>joint,</b> or via welding. Seals come in various shapes {{depending}} on the application; some can be put on after the strap is tensioned, while others must be installed before tensioning. To create the seal, the seal and strap are notched on both sides; if one set of notches are created then it is called a single notch joint, if two sets of notches are created then it is called a double notch <b>joint.</b> <b>Crimp</b> <b>joints</b> also use a seal, but crimp undulations are used instead of formed notches. These crimps form great frictional forces which keep the joint from seeping. Seal-less joints are created by forming interlocking keys {{into the middle of}} the strap.|$|R

The theoretical solution is able to reproduce the finite element analysis results and clarify {{the relation between the}} stress state and the boundary stresses. It can be appreciated from the theoretical solution that a longitudinal compressive stress at the edge <b>of</b> the <b>crimping</b> zone is generated by the boundary shear stress induced by the flow of metal end-fitting. Thus it can be deduced that the stress concentration at the edge <b>of</b> <b>crimping</b> zone could be mitigated through appropriately increasing the extent of the flow of the metal end-fitting away from the middle <b>of</b> the <b>crimping</b> zone. Our research shows that a radial tensile stress existing at the edge <b>of</b> the <b>crimping</b> zone is corresponding to the area of the rod that axial splitting is taken place.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that {{ultrasonic}} inspection provides a means <b>of</b> assessing electrical <b>crimp</b> quality that ensures the electrical and mechanical integrity <b>of</b> an initial <b>crimp</b> before the installation process is completed. The amplitude change of a compressional ultrasonic wave propagating {{at right angles to}} the wire axis and through the junction <b>of</b> a <b>crimp</b> termination was shown to correlate with the results <b>of</b> destructive pull <b>tests,</b> which is a standard for assessing crimp wire junction quality. Of additional concern are crimps made at high speed assembly lines for wiring harnesses, which are used for critical applications, such as in aircraft. During high-speed assembly it is possible that many faulty crimps go undetected until long after assembly, and fail in service.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: to characterise {{the impact}} <b>of</b> the <b>crimping</b> <b>of</b> {{polyester}} prostheses on the fluid flow kinetics. Design: an experimental in vitro study. Materials and methods: we investigated four models of polyester vascular prostheses {{in a continuous}} laminar flow circuit. The flow velocity was 80 ml/s for all experiments. We studied two fluids of different viscosity within the circuit. The speed of the particles was measured by a laser Doppler anemometer 2 to 52 mm from the prosthetic interface. We first established a calibrated flow-velocity profile corresponding {{to the study of}} the support inside the circuit without any prosthesis. We measured the velocity profiles for each prosthesis corresponding to four crimp densities obtained by stretching the grafts. Results: the <b>crimping</b> <b>of</b> PET textile prostheses led to a decrease of flow velocity especially closer to the prosthetic surface. The decrease of flow velocity was dependent on the model of prosthesis. This decrease of flow velocity is described by the following negative exponential law: ΔV=a·b−xwhere (a) is the crimp density and (b) the fluid viscosity. Conclusions: flow velocity near a prosthetic surface is influenced by the morphology <b>of</b> the <b>crimping.</b> The impact <b>of</b> <b>crimping</b> on the flow velocity in a vascular prosthesis can be predicted by computer simulation models.

Results: BraidPET caused some organ damage, sliding under normal force of 2 - 5 N; this was attributed to the high roughness of the braid pattern, the higher friction coefficient of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) compared to nylon, and the high frequency <b>of</b> the <b>crimp</b> peaks for this sleeve. No organ damage was observed for the BraidNylon, attributed to both the lower roughness of the braid pattern and the low friction coefficient of nylon.
